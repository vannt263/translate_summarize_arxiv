    "the mapping class group @xmath5 of a surface of genus @xmath6 has a long history in low - dimensional topology . in this paper , we are concerned with central extensions of @xmath5 , which have proved to be important in tqft .",
    "it follows from harer s work @xcite that @xmath5 has a universal central extension by @xmath7 , for @xmath8 ( later works improve this to @xmath9 ) .",
    "the cohomology class of such an extension is a generator of @xmath10 ( this group is isomorphic to @xmath7 for @xmath11 ) .",
    "one way to obtain explicit @xmath12-cocycles representing cohomology classes of central extensions of @xmath13 is to pull back cocycles of the symplectic group @xmath14 via the map @xmath15 which sends a mapping class @xmath16 to the induced map on the homology of the surface .",
    "the most prominent such @xmath12-cocycle among topologists is probably the signature cocycle for @xmath14 , defined by meyer @xcite using signatures of certain 4-manifolds which fiber over a disk with two holes .",
    "we will use @xmath17 to denote the pull - back of meyer s cocycle to the mapping class group @xmath5 .",
    "meyer s work implies that the cohomology class @xmath18 $ ] is divisible by four , and the class @xmath18/4 $ ] is a generator of @xmath10 .",
    "however , @xmath17 itself is not divisible by @xmath19 , and meyer did not give an explicit @xmath7-valued cocycle representing @xmath18/4 $ ] .",
    "this was done by turaev @xcite , who had independently studied the signature cocycle from a different point of view .",
    "turaev showed how to modify @xmath17 by the coboundary of a certain explicit @xmath20-cochain to find a cocycle which is divisible by four .",
    "thus , turaev s work gives an explicit cocycle for a universal central extension of @xmath5 .",
    "renewed interest in these questions was sparked by atiyah @xcite , who pointed out that the signature cocycle was closely related to the problem of resolving anomalies in tqft .",
    "anomalies are responsible for the fact that tqft - representations of mapping class groups are often only projective representations .",
    "resolving the anomalies means replacing these projective representations by linear representations of appropriate central extensions of the mapping class group . in @xcite , atiyah suggested the notion of @xmath12-framings to resolve anomalies .",
    "blanchet , habegger , masbaum and vogel @xcite used the notion of @xmath21-structures to resolve anomalies in their construction of tqft s from the skein theory of the kauffman bracket .",
    "the projective factors arising in the skein - theoretical construction of tqft were computed explicitly in masbaum - roberts @xcite .",
    "the central extensions of @xmath13 considered in the present paper are constructed using yet another approach to resolving anomalies which was pioneered by walker @xcite , and further developed by turaev @xcite .",
    "for an early use of this approach , see @xcite .",
    "as far as the mapping class group is concerned , this method depends on fixing a lagrangian subspace @xmath22 of the first rational homology of the surface .",
    "one then uses the maslov index of triples of lagrangian subspaces to define a central extension of @xmath13 .",
    "let us denote this extension by @xmath23 . the group @xmath23 is thus given explicitly as the set of pairs @xmath24 , with multiplication defined by a certain cocycle @xmath25 which we call the maslov cocycle .",
    "this cocycle is also known as the shale - weil cocycle , which is discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the signature cocycle @xmath17 , the maslov cocycle depends on the chosen lagrangian @xmath22 .",
    "but it turns out that in cohomology , one has @xmath26 = -[\\tau]$ ] .",
    "thus the class @xmath26/4 $ ] corresponds to an index - four subgroup of @xmath23 which we denote by @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , @xmath27 is a universal central extension of @xmath29 the main aim of the present paper is to explain how one can get one s hands on explicit elements of this group @xmath27 , and to understand the role played by the chosen lagrangian @xmath2 in this description .",
    "let us briefly describe the organization and main results of this paper .",
    "we find it convenient to denote the extended mapping class group @xmath23 by @xmath30 , where @xmath1 stands for the ` extended ' surface consisting of a surface together with a fixed lagrangian ( see the beginning of section  [ sec3 ] for more details ) .",
    "similarly , we will denote @xmath27 by @xmath31 . in sections  [ sec2 ] and  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we review basic concepts about maslov index and the extended cobordism category and define the extended mapping class group .",
    "the multiplication in @xmath32 is defined in formula ( [ comp ] ) in section  [ sec3 ] ( this formula is restated in terms of the maslov cocycle in formula ( [ ml1 ] ) in section  [ sec5b ] ) .    in section  [ newsec3 ] ,",
    "we use extended surgery to define certain specific lifts of dehn twists to @xmath30 and prove a surgery formula computing , for any word @xmath33 in dehn twists , the product in @xmath30 of the corresponding lifts .",
    "this formula is stated in theorem  [ new4.1 ] .",
    "it involves the signature of the linking matrix of a framed link constructed from the word @xmath33 and the lagrangian @xmath2 .",
    "our construction here is somewhat similar to the work of roberts and one of us in @xcite , but the context is different , as there were no lagrangians in @xcite .",
    "also , the framed link we are using is different from the one used in @xcite .",
    "the framed link used in @xcite would be appropriate for our purposes only for words @xmath33 representing the identity mapping class , but not in general .    in section  [ newsec5 ] , we then define @xmath34 as the subgroup of @xmath35 generated by the above - mentioned lifts of dehn twists , slightly shifted ( see definition  [ ind4 ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath36 has index four in @xmath35 is not obvious from this definition .",
    "this fact will follow from a second , purely algebraic description of @xmath34 , which we state in section  [ sec5 ] and prove in section  [ sec5b ] .",
    "we define an integer @xmath3 for any mapping class @xmath0 and lagrangian @xmath22 and show in theorems  [ hom ] and its corollary [ hom - ind ] that @xmath34 is the subset of @xmath32 given by the @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "our formula for @xmath3 uses turaev s @xmath20-cochain from @xcite , but adds to it a term which explicitly depends on the lagrangian @xmath2 .",
    "it is remarkable that turaev s cochain is defined using a certain non - symmetric bilinear form depending only on @xmath0 , while our additional term is the signature of this same form restricted to a subspace on which the form is symmetric ( but the subspace depends on the lagrangian ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ hom ] uses a formula of walker @xcite relating the signature cocycle to the maslov cocycle .",
    "we remark that walker s formula is in an unfinished manuscript , which does not claim to get the signs right .",
    "we state a version of his formula , in terms of our definitions and conventions , as theorem [ ctd ] , and give a detailed version of the proof walker outlines . also , turaev defined his version of the signature cocycle in a purely algebraic fashion , and he did not give the precise relationship with meyer s definition .",
    "in fact , turaev s cocycle turns out to be equal to @xmath39 , see proposition  [ fgint ] .",
    "since we are proving a congruence modulo four ( and not just modulo two ) , getting the signs right is important for us , so we have tried to deal with these sign issues in some detail .    in section  [ newsec7 ]",
    ", we discuss the relationship of our index four subgroup @xmath34 of @xmath40 with the index two subgroup @xmath41 constructed by one of us in @xcite .",
    "( it is this relationship which motivated the superscript @xmath42 in our notation for @xmath43 . )",
    "the preceding results all extend to the mapping class group of a surface with boundary .",
    "the ( small ) modifications required to do so are explained in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "we also explain briefly in section  [ sec7 ] how one sees that @xmath34 is a universal central extension in genus at least four .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to applications of our results to tqft .",
    "as already said , we use walker s @xcite and turaev s @xcite approach to tqft , where one consider surfaces equipped with the extra structure of a lagrangian subspace of their first homology , and 3-manifolds equipped with an integer weight . these are called extended manifolds , and the resulting extended cobordism category is used to resolve the anomalies that arise in tqft .",
    "we believe that the skein theory approach of @xcite modified by substituting extended manifolds for manifolds with @xmath21-structures is the most concrete and computable approach to the tqfts associated to @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the reason for this precision is that a lagrangian subspace may be specified algebraically while a @xmath21-structure is harder to specify . in section  [ sec8 ] , we explain how this works in practice for the mapping class group representations .",
    "see for instance , theorem [ 8.2 ] , where we state precisely how the action of an element @xmath37 of the extended mapping class group on the tqft - module associated to the surface @xmath1 depends on the chosen lagrangian @xmath2 .",
    "we then use this to do some explicit computations ( see proposition  [ 8.7 ] ) which were used in  @xcite .",
    "the beginning of section  [ sec8 ] is written so as to provide a further and more detailed introduction to the tqft - aspects of our results .    in the last section ,",
    "we briefly consider the integral tqft that we have been studying in @xcite using the precision afforded by using extended manifolds . in corollary",
    "[ modular ] , we show that the representations coming from integral tqft when restricted to @xmath34 induce modular representations of the ordinary mapping class group .",
    "this was one of our motivations for studying the index four subgroup @xmath34 .",
    "_ acknowledgments : _ we thank the referee for his comments which helped us to improve the organization of the paper .",
    "extended surfaces and 3-manifolds were introduced by walker @xcite and further developed by turaev @xcite .",
    "we begin by briefly describing these notions to fix our conventions , and sketch the background .",
    "let @xmath46 be a rational vector space with a nonsingular skew - symmetric form @xmath47 a subspace @xmath48 is called lagrangian if @xmath49 where @xmath50 it is easy to see that @xmath22 is lagrangian if and only if @xmath51 and @xmath22 has dimension @xmath52 . recall the maslov index of an ordered triple of lagrangians @xmath53 , @xmath54 in @xmath46 .",
    "the maslov index @xmath55 is defined to be the signature of the bilinear symmetric form @xmath56 on @xmath57 defined by @xmath58 ( here @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . )",
    "we will need the following well - known property of @xmath62 .",
    "[ 2lag ] the maslov index changes sign under an odd permutation of the three lagrangians .",
    "in particular , @xmath63 if two of the lagrangians are the same .",
    "recall that the first homology of a closed oriented 2-dimensional manifold @xmath1 has a skew - symmetric intersection form @xmath64 by a lagrangian of @xmath1 , we mean a lagrangian for @xmath65 with this pairing .",
    "an extended surface @xmath1 is a closed oriented 2-dimensional manifold equipped with a lagrangian subspace @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear how to take the disjoint union of extended surfaces .",
    "an extended 3-manifold @xmath67 is a compact oriented 3-dimensional manifold equipped with a weight @xmath68 , and whose oriented boundary @xmath69 has been given the structure of an extended surface with a lagrangian @xmath70 . in this case",
    "@xmath71 also has a lagrangian given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the inclusion .",
    "we denote this lagrangian by @xmath74 .",
    "we insist that @xmath70 could be chosen arbitrarily and will usually be different from @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath67 is an extended @xmath75-manifold and @xmath1 is a connected component of @xmath69 , then @xmath76 may or may not be a lagrangian for @xmath1 . if it is a lagrangian for @xmath1 , we may equip @xmath1 with this lagrangian and we will call @xmath1 , so equipped , a boundary surface of the extended 3-manifold @xmath67 .",
    "extended @xmath75-manifolds can be glued along boundary surfaces . to describe this ` extended ' gluing , we need one more notation .",
    "first , observe that if @xmath1 is a boundary surface of @xmath67 , then @xmath77 is also a boundary surface , and @xmath69 is the disjoint union of @xmath1 and @xmath78 as extended surfaces .",
    "now let @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the inclusions of @xmath1 and @xmath78 into @xmath67 , and define @xmath81 to be @xmath82 in other words , we restrict the given lagrangian @xmath70 to @xmath78 , and then ` transport ' it over to @xmath1 , using @xmath67 . note that if @xmath1 is the whole boundary of @xmath67 , so that @xmath83 , this agrees with the earlier definition of @xmath84 . as before , we insist that @xmath81 will in general be different from @xmath85 .    throughout this paper , we denote orientation reversal by an overbar . if @xmath1 is an extended surface , @xmath86 denotes the same surface with opposite orientation and with the same lagrangian @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath67 is an extended @xmath75-manifold , @xmath88 denotes the same manifold with opposite orientation and weight @xmath89 .",
    "we can now spell out the gluing formula .",
    "let @xmath67 and @xmath90 be two extended 3-manifolds and assume that @xmath1 is a boundary surface of @xmath67 and @xmath91 is a boundary surface of @xmath90 . then we may glue @xmath67 and @xmath90 ( by the orientation reversing identity map from @xmath1 to @xmath91 ) together to form a new extended @xmath75-manifold @xmath92 .",
    "the weight of @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 we write @xmath94 to indicate that this maslov index is to be computed using the intersection form of @xmath1 , rather than @xmath95 we note that @xmath96 is a lagrangian for both @xmath1 and @xmath91 as the notion of lagrangian does not depend on the orientation of the surface .",
    "the minus sign in the above formula is needed to make lemma [ 4intrep ] hold .",
    "we would get the same number computing : @xmath97 as the intersection pairings differ by a sign but an odd permutation of the lagrangians has been introduced .",
    "thus gluing of extended manifolds is ` commutative ' . in other words , it does not matter whether we think we are gluing @xmath67 to @xmath90 or @xmath90 to @xmath67 .",
    "gluing is also ` associative ' , meaning that if we have a collection of extended 3-manifolds that we wish to glue together along boundary surfaces , it does not matter in what order we do the gluing .",
    "this follows from the geometric interpretation of weights in terms of signatures of associated 4-manifolds given by walker , as well as by the more algebraic approach given in turaev s book .",
    "we now wish to define the notion of extended surgery to an extended manifold @xmath67 along a framed knot @xmath98 in @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting extended manifold will be denoted by @xmath99 .",
    "its underlying manifold is obtained by the usual surgery procedure : we use the framing and the orientation of @xmath67 to identify a closed tubular neighborhood @xmath100 of @xmath98 with @xmath101 ; we then cut out the tubular neighborhood , and replace it with @xmath102 .",
    "( note that @xmath103 . ) now , to make @xmath99 into an extended manifold , we do the same thing but use extended gluing , where the extended structure is as follows : we give @xmath104 the weight of @xmath67 , the weight of @xmath105 is zero , and we equip @xmath106 with the lagrangian generated by the homology class of the meridian of the knot @xmath98 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath107 .",
    "we remark that this is a natural choice for the lagrangian , as with this choice the result of extended gluing of @xmath104 with @xmath100 ( equipped with zero weight ) is @xmath67 with its original weight .",
    "( this follows from lemma  [ 2lag ] . )    note that since @xmath98 is a knot , we have @xmath108 , as the contribution from the maslov index to the weight of @xmath99 is computed from a symmetric bilinear form on a space of dimension at most one . if we have a framed link @xmath109 in @xmath67 , we may do a sequence of such extended surgeries or perform the surgeries all at once , and we would get the same result ( by the above - mentioned ` associativity ' of gluing ) .",
    "the resulting extended manifold is denoted @xmath110 and is called extended surgery along @xmath109 .    if @xmath109 is a framed ordered oriented link in @xmath111 , let @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the number of positive ( negative ) eigenvalues ( counted with multiplicity ) of the _ linking matrix _ of @xmath109 , that is , the symmetric integral matrix whose off - diagonal entries are the linking numbers of the components of @xmath109 , and whose diagonal entries are the framings .",
    "the number @xmath114 is the signature of the linking matrix of @xmath109 and should not be confused with what is usually called the signature of the _ link _ @xmath109 in knot theory . changing the order or the orientation of @xmath109 does not effect @xmath114 , @xmath115 , or @xmath116 .",
    "the 4-manifold interpretation of weights @xcite yields the following basic fact .",
    "[ 4intrep ] if @xmath111 is equipped with weight @xmath117 , then @xmath118 .",
    "we will realize our central extensions of the mapping class group as subgroups of a certain extended cobordism category @xmath120 .",

    "this convention is needed to make formula ( [ comp ] ) below hold .",
    "two extended cobordisms from @xmath121 to @xmath131 are considered equivalent if they have the same weight and if there is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism between them which preserves their boundary identifications .",
    "composition of extended cobordisms is associative ( on equivalence classes ) .",
    "therefore we define the morphisms of @xmath132 from @xmath121 to @xmath122 to be equivalence classes of extended cobordisms .",
    "however , from now on we will treat equivalent cobordisms as if they are identical .",
    "when it should cause no confusion , we will act as if the boundary identifications of a cobordism are identity maps .",
    "sometimes we will need to discuss extended manifolds whose extended structure we have forgotten , then we will denote them by @xmath133 , @xmath134 _ etc .",
    "_ thus , forgetting the extended structure will be denoted by an underbar .",
