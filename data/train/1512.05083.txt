    "by many aspects , quantum theory is a very strange theory with numerous non - intuitive predictions . nevertheless , our familiar classical world is the result of quantum phenomena at the atomic and subatomic levels .",
    "so , it is interesting to establish connections between classical and quantum descriptions , and to understand how the macroscopic world emerges from the microscopic world .",
    "an interesting approach for stationary quantum states is to compare the probability density given by the square modulus of the wave - function with a  classical probability distribution \" obtained from the corresponding classical equations of motion .",
    "it can then be shown that both functions approach each other , in the limit of large quantum excitations , once the rapid oscillations of the quantum density are averaged .",
    "the classical probability distribution can be compared directly with the explicit ( analytical or numerical ) corresponding quantum distribution for some particular hamiltonians .",
    "this is done , for instance , in @xcite for one - dimensional schrdinger equations . but",
    "a more general procedure is available .",
    "the wkbj method , named after wentzel , kramers , brillouin and jeffreys @xcite , yields a semi - classical solution of a quantum problem , also in the limit of large quantum excitations .",
    "so it is possible to compare the classical probability distribution directly with the averaged wkbj solution for schrdinger equations @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the same approach is generalized for one - dimensional hamiltonians with an arbitrary kinetic energy .",
    "such hamiltonians are used in several domains : atomic physics with non - parabolic dispersion relation @xcite , hadronic physics with particle masses depending on the relative momentum @xcite , quantum mechanics with a minimal length @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of a general hamiltonian with a non - usual kinetic energy are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] , where natural constraints are given on the kinetic part .",
    "the notion of classical probability distribution for the usual schrdinger equation is recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : classical ] , and extended to the case of more general hamiltonians . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wkbj ] , the wkbj approximation is generalized for this type of hamiltonians , and the connection is made between the classical probability distribution and the quantum probability distribution obtained from the wkbj method .",
    "some examples are treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the following general one - dimensional hamiltonian is considered @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the kinetic part depending on the momentum @xmath2 , and @xmath3 the potential part depending on the position @xmath4 .",
    "variables @xmath2 and @xmath4 are conjugate : @xmath5=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "this hamiltonian can correspond to a particle in a potential well if @xmath4 is interpreted as the distance from the origin , or to two particles in mutual interaction if @xmath4 is interpreted as the relative distance .",
    "it is assumed that bound states are supported by this hamiltonian and that the potential well @xmath3 has no singularity .",
    "obviously , the form of the kinetic energy @xmath6 can not be completely arbitrary .",
    "four conditions are imposed :    a. @xmath7 for all values of the momentum @xmath2 , in order that the kinetic energy is a positive quantity .",
    "this sounds physically reasonable , but this is not necessary from a mathematical point of view .",
    "b. @xmath8 .",
    "it seems reasonable that the kinetic energy is an even function of the momentum in order that it can not be dependent on the direction of propagation of the particle .    c. @xmath1 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath9 .",
    "it seems quite natural that the kinetic energy increases with the modulus of the momentum .",
    "d. @xmath1 is at least of class @xmath10 .",
    "the utility of this condition will appear below .",
    "the speed of the particle is defined using the usual hamilton s equations @xmath11 this is in agreement with the phenomenological definition given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 , since @xmath13 is an odd function because of condition  ( b ) .",
    "so , to change the sign of the momentum is to change the sign of the speed , as expected .",
    "in particular , the speed is vanishing for a null momentum , @xmath14 .",
    "using conditions ( b ) and ( d ) for small values of the momentum , one can write @xmath15 in this limit , hamiltonian  ( [ tpvx ] ) reduces to a usual schrdinger hamiltonian with an effective mass @xmath16 and a constant contribution @xmath17 to the eigenenergies which can be identified with the rest energy of the particle .",
    "the position of a particle can be , in principle , perfectly determined in a classical motion .",
    "so , for a classical probability distribution @xmath18 to make sense in this context , it is necessary to introduce a random procedure into the problem . for example",
    ", one can choose to perform a measurement of the position at a random time .",
    "as only bounded one - dimensional motions in a potential well are considered here , the motion is periodic , with a period @xmath19 , and the particle bounces back and forth between two classical turning points ( tp ) at @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we can then define the classical probability @xmath23 as the probability to find the particle into the interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "this gives @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the speed of the particle .",
    "the absolute value insures that the probability is a positive number ( the measurement is blind to the sense of propagation ) .",
    "the distribution is correctly normalized since the motion from left to right is identical to the motion from right to left , and then @xmath27 definition  ( [ rhox ] ) for @xmath18 seems quite natural since a particle is more likely measured at positions where it travels slowly . in a classical motion ,",
    "the particle can not exist outside the two tp .",
    "so , @xmath28 for @xmath29 or @xmath30 .    for a stationary solution ,",
    "the energy @xmath31 of the particle is constant and is given by @xmath32 thanks to conditions  ( b ) and ( c ) , a function @xmath33 can be defined such that @xmath34 for @xmath35 . using  ( [ ener ] ) , the speed modulus of the particle can be written as a function of @xmath4 by using the definition  ( [ speed ] ) @xmath36 we consider situations for which only two tp exist . the speed of the particle vanishing at tp , they are solutions of the equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the binding energy of the particle .",
    "the distribution @xmath18 diverges at tp , but this is not a problem , provided the normalization condition ( [ normrhox ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the kinetic part @xmath39 vanishes for a null momentum .",
    "it has the following properties : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "so , @xmath42 this shows that the presence of a rest energy does not influence the dynamics of the system .",
    "the wkbj approximation relies on a semi - classical expansion of the wave - function @xmath43 of the form @xmath44 with the parameter @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "usually , this parameter @xmath46 is simply posed as @xmath47 .",
    "but it is more satisfactory , from a mathematical point of view , to build a dimensionless quantity depending on @xmath47 and other characteristic parameters of the system under study . in @xcite , for non - relativistic systems ( @xmath48 ) , it is suggested to take @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the distance between the two tp , @xmath51 is the mass of the particle .",
    "the semi - classical limit can then be reached for high value of the energy @xmath52 , large mass @xmath51 of the particle or large size of the classical region @xmath53 .",
    "this parameter appears naturally in a dimensionless rewriting of the schrdinger equation . with a non - standard kinematics ,",
    "this parameter must be redefined since there is a priori no automatic equivalent of the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "this will be done at the end of this section . in the following",
    ", it is simply assumed that @xmath46 can always be determined .",
    "the computation of the wkbj approximation for a schrdinger equation can be found in many textbooks .",
    "but with a non - standard kinetic part , the derivation is more involved .",
    "the procedure developed here is inspired from a calculation performed in @xcite for a non - relativistic wkbj approximation computed in the momentum space .",
    "the equation to solve is @xmath54 where the kinetic operator is defined by its taylor expansion @xmath55 condition ( d ) is not sufficient to guarantee the relevance of this last expression .",
    "this will be commented below . for the moment , ( [ 3.3a ] )",
    "is assumed correct .",
    "as the limit @xmath45 will be considered , it can be shown by induction that @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the combination of ( [ 3.3a ] ) and ( [ prop3.1 ] ) gives @xmath58.\\ ] ] putting this last result in ( [ 3.3 ] ) , and dropping the exponential factor , gives @xmath59 where the coefficient @xmath60 is reabsorbed in @xmath61 .",
    "the function @xmath62 can also be expanded in powers of @xmath46 @xmath63 where all function @xmath64 are assumed to be independent of @xmath46 . in this case ,",
    "an obvious result is @xmath65 the last equation yields @xmath66 and @xmath67 finally , ( [ 3.5 ] ) can be written @xmath68 \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\alpha \\left[\\epsilon \\frac{d \\sigma_1}{d x } t'\\left(\\epsilon",
    "\\frac{d \\sigma_0}{d x}\\right ) - \\frac{i}{2 } \\epsilon^2 \\frac{d^2 \\sigma_0}{d x^2 } t''\\left(\\epsilon \\frac{d \\sigma_0}{d x}\\right)\\right ] + \\textrm{o}(\\alpha^2 ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient of each power of @xmath46 must be vanishing , that is to say @xmath69 only a solution between the two tp is searched for . with the definition given above for the function @xmath70 , ( [ 3.7a ] ) implies @xmath71",
    "whose solution is given by @xmath72 the notation @xmath73 denotes the integral of the function @xmath74 with one limit at @xmath4 and the other limit at one of the tp .",
    "equation  ( [ 3.7b ] ) can be written @xmath75 using ( [ epst ] ) , the solution of this last equation is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant .",
    "the argument of the @xmath78-function is positive thanks to the definition of the function @xmath70 .",
    "finally , using  ( [ wkbj ] ) , the wave - function can be written @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are normalization constants .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is not explicitly present is this expression .",
    "but , this approximation is only valid when @xmath82 .",
    "the usual form is recovered for a non - relativistic kinematics .",
    "in the case of bound states , the wave - function decays exponentially outside the tp .",
    "inside , a calculation similar to the non - relativistic one @xcite gives @xmath83 the normalization constant @xmath84 and phase angle @xmath85 are determined by matching this eigenfunction onto the evanescent wave - functions outside the tp .",
    "this procedure is not trivial because the wkbj eigenfunction is a poor approximation to the actual eigenfunction near the tp .",
    "this problem has been solved by langer in the non - relativistic case by using an explicit solution of the schrdinger equation near the tp @xcite . in the case of a non - standard kinetic energy ,",
    "the point must be reconsidered .",
    "but , very close to the tp , the particle is very slow and the kinetic energy can be replaced by the expansion  ( [ texp ] ) .",
    "the general hamiltonian  ( [ tpvx ] ) reduces then to a schrdinger hamiltonian .",
    "equation  ( [ tp0 ] ) shows that the presence of a rest energy does not change the dynamics .",
    "we can deduce that the result of langer is still valid and that @xmath86 .",
    "computations are performed in the position space with @xmath87 , but it is equivalent to work in the momentum space with @xmath88 .",
    "there is no relevant differences between the results obtained by the two procedures , since the fourier transform of the wave - function obtained by the wkbj method in the position space is equal to the wave - function obtained by the wkbj method in the momentum space up to a term @xmath61 .",
    "this can be shown by a procedure which is similar to the one presented in @xcite for a non - relativistic kinematics .",
    "the quantification of the energy is obtained from the constraint that the wave - function  ( [ 3.14 ] ) can be defined by integrating from one tp or from the other .",
    "the calculation is not different from the non - relativistic case @xcite , and the result is @xmath89 where the quantum number @xmath90 is a positive integer including 0 .",
    "the limits of integration depend on @xmath31 via relation  ( [ tp ] ) .    in principle , ( [ 3.3a ] ) demands a smooth behaviour of the kinetic operator , much more constraining that condition  ( d ) .",
    "nevertheless , once the wkbj approximation is computed , it appears that non - smooth terms after the second derivative in the expansion of @xmath6 could probably spoil very little the quality of the approximation .",
    "this will be checked on an example in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] .",
    "it is well known that the classical limit is reached for large values of the quantum number @xmath90 , that is to say for large values of the excitation energy . in order to make apparent the role of @xmath90 in these cases ,",
    "@xmath91 is replaced by a constant , denoted here @xmath92 .",
    "then , ( [ 3.17 ] ) reduces to @xmath93 that is to say @xmath94 in the non - relativistic case , the right - hand side of ( [ 3.17c ] ) is the number @xmath46 defined by ( [ alpha ] ) , provided @xmath92 is replaced by @xmath52 .",
    "a natural definition of the parameter @xmath46 for all types of kinematics is then @xmath95 where @xmath92 is an estimation of @xmath91 , and where @xmath53 depends also on @xmath38 by ( [ tp ] ) .",
    "if the potential has no singularity , @xmath92 can be chosen as @xmath96 for instance .",
    "but an accurate computation of @xmath92 is not necessary to validate the method , since solutions  ( [ 3.14 ] ) and ( [ 3.17 ] ) do not explicitly depend on @xmath46 .",
    "it is just sufficient to be sure that a small parameter @xmath46 can be defined for the system under study .",
    "the semi - classical regime is then reached when @xmath82 , that is to say @xmath97 since @xmath98 . within these conditions , the variable argument of the sine function in ( [ 3.14 ] ) can be approximated by @xmath99 and the sine function oscillates a great number of times between the two tp .",
    "the approximate quantum probability distribution is given by @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "for @xmath29 or @xmath30 , it can be assumed that this distribution is vanishing since the wave - function decays exponentially .",
    "a classical approximation @xmath102 for the quantum distribution @xmath103 is obtained by replacing the rapidly oscillating square sine function by its average value @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "finally , inside the two tp , @xmath105 with proper normalizations , ( [ rhovx ] ) and ( [ rhoa ] ) are identical .",
    "this shows that , for a quite general one - dimensional hamiltonian , the quantum probability distribution and the classical probability distribution approach each other , in the limit of large quantum excitations , once the rapid oscillations of the quantum density are averaged .",
    "in order to test the validity of the wkbj approximation for a non - usual kinematics , eigenstates of the relativistic hamiltonian , written in natural unit ( @xmath106 ) , @xmath107 have been computed .",
    "such hamiltonian ( in 3d - space ) are used to study hadrons in constituent quark models @xcite .",
    "the numerical solutions are computed with the fourier grid hamiltonian ( fgh ) method @xcite , which is particularly well suited for the case of hamiltonians with non - standard kinetic parts @xcite .",
    "the quantum probability distribution @xmath108 obtained by this method has been compared with the corresponding distributions @xmath103 and @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath108 is normalized to unity on @xmath110-\\infty,+\\infty[$ ] , while @xmath103 and @xmath109 are normalized to unity on @xmath110a , b[$ ] . for such hamiltonian ,",
