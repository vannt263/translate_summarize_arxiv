    "gravitationally lensed quasars have proven to be a useful tool for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological studies , as described e.g. , in @xcite",
    ". applications of quasar lenses include constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and measurements of mass distributions for galaxy- and cluster - scale halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , interstellar medium associated with lensing or intervening galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the structure of quasar accretion disk and outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of these applications take advantage of the time - variable nature of quasars and therefore are not available for galaxy - galaxy strong lenses .",
    "the use of these quasar lenses can be enhanced by constructing a homogeneous lens sample with a well - characterized selection function .",
    "for instance , the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has provided a complete sample of 22 strong lenses selected among @xmath1116,000 radio sources , which has been used for a number of cosmological and astrophysical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have completed the sdss quasar lens search ( sqls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is the current largest lensed quasar survey using optical data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , we have discovered more than 40 lensed quasars including four lensed quasars presented in this paper .",
    "we have also rediscovered many previously known lensed quasars located in the sdss footprint @xcite .",
    "the total number of lensed quasars identified in the sdss data is 62 @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis for sqls lenses to constrain both cosmological parameters and the evolution of massive galaxies has been reported in @xcite .    in this paper , we report the discovery of four lensed quasars from the sqls . since the description of the four lensed quasars in @xcite is so brief , we show the detailed properties of the four systems here .",
    "we briefly describe the sdss data and our algorithm to locate lensed quasar candidates in   [ sec : sdss ] .",
    "we then present follow - up observations to confirm their lensing hypotheses in ",
    "[ sec : follow - up ] .",
    "we carry out mass modeling in   [ sec : model ] .",
    "our result is summarized in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the sqls identifies lensed quasars among @xmath12 quasars @xcite from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) .",
    "the sdss is a survey using a dedicated wide - field 2.5-meter telescope @xcite at the apache point observatory ( new mexico , usa ) to conduct imaging and spectroscopic surveys for a quarter of the sky .",
    "the imaging data were obtained through five broad - band filters ( @xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with astrometric accuracy better than @xmath14 @xcite and with photometric zeropoint accuracy better than @xmath15  mag @xcite .",
    "quasar and galaxy candidates were selected by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline based on the imaging data @xcite .",
    "the candidates were tiled in each plate according to the algorithm of @xcite , and were observed with multi - object fiber spectrographs ( @xmath16 ) covering 3800 to 9200 @xcite .",
    "the sdss dr7 data have already been made public @xcite .",
    "the procedure to identify lensed quasar candidates from the spectroscopic sdss quasars has been described in the series of sqls papers @xcite , which we outline here .",
    "we use two selection methods .",
    "one is to find quasars with nearby objects whose colors are similar to the quasars .",
    "this method is tagged as the `` color selection '' .",
    "the color selection does not always work well for the sdss data because of the relatively poor spatial resolution of sdss imaging data , whose seeing sizes are comparable to typical image separations of quasar lenses . therefore , in order to find lenses which are not deblended into multiple components in the sdss data , we also exploit the so - called `` morphological selection '' , in which we select spectroscopic quasars with extended morphologies as lensed quasar candidates .",
    "sdss  j0743 + 2457 and sdss  j1128 + 2402 are selected by the morphological selection , whereas sdss  j1405 + 0959 and sdss  j1515 + 1511 are selected by both the color selection and the morphological selection .",
    "the sdss properties of these four candidates are summarized in table  [ tab : sdss ] .",
    "we also show the sdss @xmath17-band images of the four objects in figure  [ fig : fc ] .",
    "we note that sdss  j0743 + 2457 and sdss  j1405 + 0959 have been reported as quasar lenses ulas  074352.6 + 245743 and ulas  140515.4 + 095931 , respectively , by the major ukidss - sdss cosmic lens survey ( muscles ) survey @xcite . in the muscles survey lens candidates",
    "are selected by cross - matching sdss quasars with ukidss near - infrared images which typically have much better spatial resolution .",
    "our identification of sdss  j0743 + 2457 and sdss  j1405 + 0959 as lens candidates is independent of the muscles survey result .",
    "we carried out follow - up imaging and spectroscopic observations using the university of hawaii 2.2-meter telescope ( uh88 ) , the astrophysical research consortium 3.5-meter telescope ( arc ) , the 3.58-meter telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , the subaru 8.2-m telescope , and the gemini north 8.1-m telescope , to confirm the lensing hypothesis of the four lensed quasar candidates .",
    "all the four candidates are doubly imaged lens candidates , and therefore their lensing hypothesis should be confirmed by both similar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the two stellar components and the existence of an extended object between the two components that act as a lens .",
    "we summarize the details of our follow - up imaging and spectroscopic observations in tables  [ tab : image ] and [ tab : spec ] .",
    "we clearly detect two stellar components in each original image of the follow - up imaging observations .",
    "once we subtract two point spread functions ( psfs ) using galfit @xcite , we detect a significant residual , indicating an additional component in between the two psfs , for all four systems .",
    "we then model the system with two psfs plus an extended component represented by a srsic profile .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : iband ] , an extended component is clearly visible after subtracting the two psfs .",
    "the srsic parameters of the best - fitting model are summarized in table  [ tab : sersic ] .",
    "we also summarize the astrometric and photometric results for each system in table  [ tab : opt ] .",
    "results of the spectroscopic follow - up observations are shown in figure  [ fig : allspec ] .",
    "for each candidate , we aligned the slit direction such that we can observe the two stellar components simultaneously .",
    "the good seeing condition ( fwhm@xmath1810 ) enabled us to extract the spectrum of each component easily using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the spectra indicate that the seds of the two stellar components are quite similar for all four systems .",
    "in particular , the two quasar components of the sdss  j1405 + 0959 system have very similar broad absorption , which is in strong support of strong lensing interpretation of this system .",
    "the fainter component of sdss  j1515 + 1511 shows a strong absorption at @xmath19 , which corresponds to an absorber at @xmath20 , and is likely to be associated with the lensing galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "first we examine our follow - up spectra carefully to look for any spectral signature of lensing galaxies .",
    "we find that the spectrum of the fainter component of sdss  j0743 + 2457 contains a significant amount of galaxy flux .",
    "we extract the spectrum of the lensing galaxy g by subtracting the spectrum of image a , with an appropriate offset corresponding to the flux ratio , from that of image b. figure  [ fig : spec0743 g ] clearly indicates that the lensing galaxy is an early - type galaxy at @xmath1 .    for the other lens systems",
    ", we estimate redshifts of the lensing galaxies based on their colors . for sdss  j1405 + 0959",
    ", the srsic concentration index suggests that the residual may be a late - type galaxy . in this case , the @xmath21 and @xmath22 colors imply that the redshift is @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is broadly consistent with @xmath24 derived in @xcite using the overall spectral shape of the lensing galaxy in their follow - up spectroscopic data . for sdss",
    "j1515 + 1511 , the morphology is more robust in the @xmath17-band , where it is consistent with a late - type galaxy .",
    "its color @xmath25 implies the redshift of @xmath26 , which is close to the redshift @xmath20 of the strong absorber seen in the spectrum of the fainter quasar image .",
    "thus we tentatively assign its lens redshift to be @xmath9 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the photometric lens redshift of sdss  j1128 + 2402 from the current data .",
    "we model the lens systems adopting a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) mass model using _ glafic _ @xcite .",
    "the number of parameters is eight ( the position and flux of the source quasar , the position of the lensing galaxy , the einstein radius , the ellipticity , and the position angle ) , while the number of constraints from the imaging observations is also eight ( the positions and fluxes of the two quasar components , and the position of the lensing galaxy ) .",
    "thus the model has zero degrees of freedom .",
    "we adopt the @xmath27-band imaging result as constraints for sdss  j0743 + 2457 , sdss  j1128 + 2402 , and sdss  j1405 + 0959 . for sdss  j1515 + 1511",
    ", we use the @xmath17-band imaging result in spite of the lens being comparatively fainter , because the seeing was smaller , there were more stars available to build a psf , and both astrometry and morphology are more robust .",
    "we summarize the parameters of the best - fitting ( @xmath28 ) models in table  [ tab : model ] . as is common ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are large differences in the lensing galaxy shapes between the observations ( table  [ tab : sersic ] ) and the best - fitting mass model parameters ( table  [ tab : model ] ) .",
    "this may partly be explained by nearby perturbers which affect the lens potentials .",
    "we have confirmed the lensing hypothesis for four lens candidates selected by the sqls , based on the similar seds of the stellar components together with the existence of extended objects in between the stellar components , and the successful mass modeling of the observed configurations .",
    "all four are doubly imaged quasar lens systems : sdss  j0743 + 2457 ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , sdss  j1128 + 2402 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , sdss  j1405 + 0959 ( @xmath5 , @xmath29 , @xmath7 ) , and sdss  j1515 + 1511 ( @xmath8 , @xmath30 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "two of them ( sdss  j1405 + 0959 and sdss  j1515 + 1511 ) are included in the sqls statistical sample @xcite and are used for cosmological constraints @xcite .",
    "these lens systems represent likely the last quasar lenses to emerge from the sqls project .",
    "the applications of the sqls lenses have been limited by the lack of high - resolution images for many of the sqls lenses .",
    "we are therefore currently conducting a program to observe the sqls lenses with subaru telescope laser guide start adaptive optics system to accurately measure the quasar image positions and light profile of the lensing galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
