    "the body of mc is identified to be enclosed by a white solid line in the images and between two dotted lines in attached profiles .",

    "the mc center approaches l1 71 hours after its departure from the inner boundary , and the value of @xmath0 index decreases monotonically to its minimum @xmath77 shortly afterwards ( at 88.6 hours ) .",
    "in addition , the draping imf within mc - driven sheath is mainly northward .",
    "this is why the compressed magnetic field in the sheath does not cause significant @xmath0 disturbance in our simulation .",
    "shock compression is an efficient mechanism for the enhancement of southward component of magnetic field and , hence , serves as an ip cause of large geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "the subsequent numerical simulations aim to quantify geoeffectiveness of a shock overtaking an mc in detail .",
    "to investigate the interaction between a fast forward shock and a preceding mc , a shock centered at hcs ( @xmath78 ) is introduced from the inner boundary to pursue the previous occurred mc .",
    "the mc in this case is identical with that in case a. the shock emerges at @xmath79 with its center on the equator , and other parameters @xmath80 one can find that the maximum shock speed is @xmath81 from the above quantities by the shock relation .",

    "only , the overwhelming forward shock will soon collide with mc body .",
    "moreover , the tangential magnetic field component increases as fast shock passes by .",

    "its propagation in mc would not be stopped or diffused despite mc resistance .",
    "in addition , the domain of so - called  magnetic vacuum \" behind shock front is magnified during the process of shock overtaking rear part of mc , because the mc , an enclosed magnetic loop , serves as an obstacle in front of shock .",
    "the mc just passes by l1 at 82 hours . though shock continues to penetrate mc into a deeper position , mc - shock compound structure will no longer cause the geoeffectiveness shortly after it passes by the orbit of earth .",

    "once the fast shock advances deeply into the mc , the latter , superseding the ambient ip space , serves as a medium for the shock propagation . since hcs does not exist in the mc , what ensues is the disappearance of the hcs - associated concave .",

    "moreover , sheath width , defined by the radial distance along the equator between mc - driven shock front and the outer mc boundary , is @xmath102 in case c , only half of that in case a , @xmath103 . compared with case a , several distinct differences are easily discriminated in case c to emphasize the shock impact : ( 1 ) the geometry of mc boundary changes in the shape from quasi - circle to oblate ellipse ; ( 2 ) mc is highly compressed ; ( 3 ) the width of mc - driven sheath is significantly narrowed .",

    "physical interpretation for the variance of mc width is as follows : ( 1 ) the mc abruptly expands at initial stage because its inherent magnetic field is overwhelming over that of the ambient solar wind .",

    "the diameter and width of mc in case c is compressed by the shock , as indicated in figure  [ multi - geometry](b ) and ( c ) .",

    "@xmath116 is about 0.76 in our model , consistent with relevant results @xcite .",
    "the expansion of individual mc is pronounced from figure  [ multi - geometry ] , even on the condition of the adiabatic process @xmath118 .",

    "compared to relevant simulation ( figure 7(b ) in @xcite ) , the behavior of mc diameter in our simulation differs only after shock emergence from mc medium .",
    "because the forward shock in @xcite is driven by the following mc , the diameter of preceding mc remains constant by the compression of following mc body when the shock propagates at the front of preceding mc . with the push from",

    "the southward passing magnetic flux decreases steadily away from the equator because the mc propagates along the hcs . on the other hand ,",

    "synthetical analyses on some crucial parameters are given in figure  [ depth3 ] , where the three vertical delimiting lines ( dotted , dashed and dotted ) from left to right correspond to the cases of shock encountering the tail , the core and the front of mc at l1 , respectively . from top to bottom are plotted ( a ) the duration between the emergences of mc and shock from the inner boundary , noted by @xmath124 , ( b ) the @xmath0 index , ( c ) the minimum of dawn - dusk electric field @xmath99 , noted by @xmath125 , ( d ) the interval between the commencement of @xmath126 and the corresponding @xmath0 minimum , noted by @xmath127 , ( e ) the minimum of @xmath128 , noted by @xmath129 , ( f ) the maximum of magnetic field magnitude @xmath130 , and ( g ) the arrival times of the mc and the shock along the equator , respectively .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in figure  [ depth3](b)-(f ) correspond to the hypothetic satellites located at @xmath131 and @xmath62 , respectively . it can be seen that mc and shock interact with each other and merge into a complex compound structure when @xmath132 50 hours .",

    "= @xmath60 and -165  nt along lat .",
    "= @xmath62 is obtained when the shock front just approaches mc core at l1 , corresponding to @xmath137 , as indicated by vertical dashed line of figure  [ depth3 ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath130 remains constant during @xmath138 , because increasing magnetic field magnitude at compressed region of mc is not yet comparable to that at mc core .",
    "the minimum of @xmath129 and @xmath133 are obtained at a certain position in the rear part of mc .",
    "when the shock front exceeds the mc core and compresses its anterior part with @xmath139 , in which the magnetic field is northward , @xmath0 recovers in different slopes along two latitudes .",
    "it recovers gradually from -185 to -175 nt along lat .",

    "= @xmath62 . when @xmath140 hours , the shock penetrates and propagates completely through the mc before l1 .",
    "the region of dramatic interaction shifts from mc body to mc - driven sheath . as a result , magnetic field tension of mc body overcomes the grip of post - shock total pressure and @xmath0 continues to recover monotonically as @xmath141 decreases .",
    "in addition , the minimum of @xmath127 ( 5 hours ) and mc passage interval ( 13 hours ) correspond to @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "in contrast with -103 nt along lat .",
    "= @xmath60 in corresponding individual mc event , @xmath0 reaches its minimum -185 nt along the same latitude with 80% increment in intensity when the shock front advances into mc core .",
    "moreover , the shock transport time in mc - shock cases is shortened within @xmath144 in contrast with that in the corresponding individual shock event , as indicated in figure  [ depth3](g ) .",
    "the shortened time is 3.8 hours in maximum , corresponding to @xmath145 . when the shock propagates from ip medium to mc medium , enhanced local magnetosonic speed and decreased bulk flow speed upstream shock front coexist .",
    "the joint effect of these two factors determines whether the shock is faster or slower in mc medium .",
    "hence the propagation speed of incidental shock influenced by the mc depends on the interval between their commencements .",
    "using a 2.5d ideal mhd numerical model , mc - shock interaction and its geoeffectiveness are investigated for better understanding of the ip  shock overtaking mc \" events @xcite .",
    "our compound numerical algorithm is capable of capturing sharp shock front , ensuring the absence of magnetic monopole , guaranteeing the conservation of axial and toroidal magnetic flux of magnetic rope , and so on .",
    "the simulations reveal dynamic characteristics of ip mc - shock interaction and their associated geoeffectiveness in some aspects .",
    "firstly , numerical simulation is carried out on an individual mc with its inherent magnetic field overwhelming over that in the ambient flow .",
    "characteristics of the specific mc propagation through ip space are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the mc core propagates with a nearly constant speed ; ( 2 ) its diameter expands rapidly at initial stage .",
    "it then expands with a slower asymptotic speed ; ( 3 ) its angular width also expands rapidly at initial stage , but gradually contracts afterwards . moreover , the characteristics of an mc , such as strong magnetic field , smooth rotation of magnetic field , low proton temperature , low plasma @xmath4 , and so on , are quite in agreement with the observations .",
    "secondly , numerical simulation is conducted to model mc - shock interaction .",
    "a strong fast shock centered at hcs emerges from the inner boundary to pursue the preceding mc .",
    "it is found that the compression and rotation of magnetic field serve as an efficient mechanism to cause large geomagnetic storm .",
    "the fast shock initially catches up with the preceding mc .",
    "it then penetrates through the mc and finally merges with the mc - driven shock into a stronger compound shock . when the fast shock propagates through ip space , its front is characterized with a central concave shape in the equator",
    "; when it enters the preceding mc , its front evolves into a purely arc shape .",
    "the morphology of shock front is determined by the local medium .",
    "after the shock front enters mc medium , the remaining high speed flow just downstream of incidental shock front can not completely enter the preceding mc , and it just follows behind the mc all the time .",
    "the mc is highly compressed by the overtaking shock .",
    "the solar - terrestrial transport time of incidental shock relates closely to the duration between the emergences of mc and itself .",
    "lastly , the associated geoeffectiveness is studied based on numerical simulations .",
    "in contrast with the corresponding individual mc event , mc - shock interaction results in a largest geomagnetic storm with 80% increment in terms of @xmath0 . based on an analytical solution for the process of shock propagation from the inner boundary to the center of mc , @xcite suggested that the maximum geomagnetic storm be caused by shock penetrating mc at a certain depth , and the stronger the incident shock is , the deeper is the position .",
    "meanwhile , the incidental shock in our simulation is very strong and the results show that the maximum geomagnetic storm occurs when the shock front encounters mc core .",
    "our numerical model agrees to some extent with that by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high speed flow right after the tail of mc boundary in our simulation mentioned previously might be responsible for the minor difference of shock penetration depth between the two models regarding the maximum geomagnetic storm .",
    "one can see that the compressed sheath field ahead of mc in our simulations is generally northward and , hence , contribute little to geoeffectiveness ( figure  [ mc.l1 ] , [ mc - shock - b.l1 ] , [ mc - shock - c.l1 ] ) .",
    "if both mc helicity and ambient imf orientation are reversed , the magnetic field within mc - driven sheath and front part of mc will be directed southward and , hence , will be responsible for geomagnetic storm .",
    "some of qualitative results compared to that discussed above can be straightforwardly conceived as follows : ( 1 ) only when a shock propagates into the front of an mc does the shock exert its effect on geoeffectiveness ; ( 2 ) a shock losses its energy and momentum heavily during its propagation through the rear part of an mc , so that it has relatively weaker influence on the geoeffectiveness by penetrating the preceding mc . moreover , if an incidental shock is not strong enough , it may be dissipated quickly even in the rear part of an mc .",
    "detailed quantitative investigation should resort to numerical simulation .",
    "this interesting topic will be addressed in near future .",
    "we express our heartfelt thanks to the referees for their constructive comments .",

    "<S> numerical studies have been performed to interpret the observed `` shock overtaking magnetic cloud ( mc ) '' event by a 2.5 dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model in heliospheric meridional plane . results of an individual mc simulation show that the mc travels with a constant bulk flow speed . </S>",
    "<S> the mc is injected with very strong inherent magnetic field over that in the ambient flow and expands rapidly in size initially . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the diameter of mc increases in an asymptotic speed while its angular width contracts gradually . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , simulations of mc - shock interaction are also presented , in which both a typical mc and a strong fast shock emerge from the inner boundary and propagate along heliospheric equator , separated by an appropriate interval . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the shock firstly catches up with the preceding mc , then penetrates through the mc , and finally merges with the mc - driven shock into a stronger compound shock . </S>",
    "<S> the morphologies of shock front in interplanetary space and mc body behave as a central concave and a smooth arc respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the compression and rotation of magnetic field serve as an efficient mechanism to cause a large geomagnetic storm . </S>",
    "<S> the mc is highly compressed by the the overtaking shock . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily , the transport time of incidental shock influenced by the mc depends on the interval between their commencements . </S>",
    "<S> maximum geoeffectiveness results from that when the shock enters the core of preceding mc , which is also substantiated to some extent by a corresponding simplified analytic model . quantified by @xmath0 index , </S>",
    "<S> the specific result gives that the geoeffectiveness of an individual mc is largely enhanced with 80% increment in maximum by an incidental shock . </S>"
