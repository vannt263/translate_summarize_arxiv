    "in this paper we calculate the free energy of qcd on the lattice , up to three loops in perturbation theory .",
    "we are interested in the three dimensional case , involving only gluons .",
    "the choice of studying the free energy is motivated by the fact that , apart from being a simple physical observable which can be calculated in perturbation theory , it is used to determine the static thermodynamic properties of a physical system .",
    "furthermore , this quantity is ideal for studying various aspects of qcd .",
    "for example , the free energy is often employed in the context of thermal qcd , for the purpose of characterizing the deconfinement transition between the low temperature regime , ruled by confinement , and the high temperature regime ruled by asymptotic freedom .",
    "asymptotic freedom guarantees a small coupling constant at large temperatures , which in turn allows for a perturbative evaluation of observables .",
    "in addition to that , the perturbation expansion of the free energy is involved in the determination of the `` finite part '' of the gluon condensate in lattice regularization .",
    "finally , the plaquette expectation value , which is directly related to the free energy , is considered in the study of an effective 3-d pure gauge theory called magnetostatic qcd ( mqcd )  @xcite , which is matched to qcd using perturbation theory . due to the superrenormalizable nature of the 3-d theory ,",
    "only a finite number of divergences arise and these can be computed perturbatively , allowing for a complete match between the lattice regularization scheme and a continuum scheme such as @xmath2 .",
    "mqcd is an instance of `` dimensional reduction '' , whereby the static properties of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional field theory at high temperature can be expressed in terms of an effective field theory in 3 space dimensions .",
    "dimensional reduction has been applied to qcd ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , in order to resolve a longstanding problem regarding the breakdown of the perturbation expansion for the free energy  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the free energy in four dimensions has already been carried out to 2 loops  @xcite and 3 loops  @xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "the only results available so far have been obtained through the method of stochastic perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "our results can be used both for comparison with existing results extracted from different methods , or for calculations involving the perturbative expansion of the free energy . with respect to this ,",
    "the coefficients of the perturbative expansion allow the subtraction of all the divergent contributions from the gluon condensate  @xcite and improve the previous estimates of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in standard notation the wilson action for gluons reads :    @xmath3    \\label{glact}\\ ] ]    here @xmath4 is the usual product of link variables @xmath5 along the perimeter of a plaquette in the @xmath6-@xmath7 directions , originating at @xmath8 ; @xmath9 denotes the bare coupling constant .",
    "powers of the lattice spacing @xmath10 have been omitted and may be directly reinserted by dimensional counting .",
    "we use the standard covariant gauge - fixing term  @xcite ; in terms of the gauge field @xmath11 @xmath12 $ ] , it reads : @xmath13    having to compute a gauge invariant quantity , we chose to work in the feynman gauge , @xmath14 .",

    "the full action is :    @xmath21    in d - dimensions , the average value of the action density , @xmath22 , is directly related to the average @xmath23 plaquette @xmath24 : @xmath25 where : @xmath26,\\qquad \\beta = { 2\\,n\\over g_0 ^ 2 } \\label{e(p)}\\ ] ]    we will calculate @xmath27 in perturbation theory : @xmath28    the @xmath29-loop coefficients @xmath30 have been known for some time up to 3 loops in the 4-dimensional theory  @xcite .",

    "a total of 36 feynman diagrams contribute to the present calculation , up to three loops , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the involved algebra of the lattice perturbation theory was carried out using our computer package in mathematica .",
    "the value for each diagram is computed numerically for a sequence of finite lattice sizes @xmath43 , followed by an extrapolation to @xmath44 ( see next section ) .",
    "the finite - l results , on a per diagram basis , are available upon request from the authors .",
    "we performed two independent calculations for each diagram , in order to verify our results .",
    "certain diagrams , considered individually , are infrared divergent ; they contain subdiagrams which renormalize the gluon propagator to one loop , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "taken as a group , these diagrams become infrared finite and their value can be extrapolated to infinite lattice size ; extrapolation leads to a ( small ) systematic error , which is estimated quite accurately .",
    "the coefficients @xmath45 involved in the perturbative expansion of @xmath46 can be calculated by summing all contributing diagrams .",
    "they take the form : @xmath47     +     +    the index @xmath48 runs over all contributing diagrams .",
    "the coefficients @xmath49 are pure numbers and we calculate them for each diagram separately .",
    "their numerical values are listed in tables [ c2table ] and [ c3table ] .",
    "for some diagrams , the coefficients are known analytically .",
    "the expressions are presented as a function of the 1-loop vacuum diagram @xmath50 ( see below ) : @xmath51 the value of @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of the bessel function of the first kind @xmath52 : @xmath53 ^ 3=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}dt\\bigg[e^{-2t}i_0(2t)\\bigg]^3 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & 0.2527310098590\\cdots \\label{p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ghost loop in diagram 21 leads to a vanishing contribution by color antisymmetry .",
    "using our results we can express the average free energy as a function of @xmath9 , for specific values of @xmath1 : @xmath54 @xmath55    presented in fig .",
    "3 is the behaviour of the average free energy as a function of @xmath56 , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "several remarks are in order regarding our computation .",
    "@xmath59  as mentioned above , certain subsets of diagrams are infrared finite only when summed together , and they correspond to insertions of the one - loop renormalized gluon propagator .",
    "similarly , diagrams 11 , 12 and 13 renormalize the ghost propagator ; however , they are separately finite .",
    "@xmath59  the manipulation of the algebraic expressions in order to reach a code for numerical loop integration , is completely done in mathematica .",
    "the production of vertices as well as their contraction is fully automated .",
    "a number of routines render automatic the simplification of the expressions ( such as color contractions and lorentz index manipulation ) and exploitation of their symmetries .",
    "we have also developed an efficient three dimensional `` integrator '' to automatically convert the integrand to fortran code .",
    "the size of a typical input integrand is up to @xmath60 terms after simplification .",
    "finally , the extrapolation of data to infinite @xmath43 is also automated .",
    "the only part which is done by hand is the enumeration of diagrams , but this is simple enough to do , even up to 4 loops .",
    "each @xmath29-vertex diagram is represented by an @xmath61 `` incidence '' matrix @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number of gluons joining vertices @xmath64 and @xmath48 and by a similar matrix for ghosts .",
    "the procedure described above is not cpu intensive as regards symbolic manipulations in mathematica .",
    "of course , this is due to the usage of wilson action for gluons ( improved actions are more cumbersome in terms of cpu as well as ram ) .",
    "@xmath59  numerical integrals are performed for finite lattice sizes ] , up to @xmath65 , and the results are subsequently extrapolated to @xmath44 .",
    "diagrams 18 - 20 ( those having the form of the mercedes emblem ) are more cpu intensive and require approximately 40 hours each ( for @xmath66 ) on a recent pentiumiv computer ( 3.2 ghz ) ; for these diagrams , integration over the three loop momenta can only be performed in a nested fashion , rather than in parallel .",
    "fortunately , lattice sizes up to @xmath66 already lead to a sufficiently small systematic error in these cases . for the rest of the diagrams , two out of the three loop momenta can be integrated in a parallel fashion , and the calculation requires approximately 1 hour per diagram for @xmath65 .",
    "extrapolation to infinite lattice size is of course a source of systematic error . to estimate this error",
    ", our procedure carries out the following steps : first , different extrapolations of our numerical data @xmath67 are performed using a broad spectrum of functional forms @xmath68 ( around 50 of them ) of the type : @xmath69      for the @xmath71 such extrapolation , a deviation @xmath73 is calculated using alternative criteria for quality of fit .",
    "one possible criterion , as an example , is the difference : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the largest lattice size which was not used in the determination of @xmath76 .",
    "finally , these deviations are used to assign weights @xmath77 to each extrapolation , producing a final value together with the error estimate .",
    "we can check the reliability of our error estimates in a number of ways : in those cases where the result for a diagram is also known analytically , this result coincides with the numerical one within the systematic error ; also , extrapolations which incorporate new data from larger lattices are compatible with previous results , again within systematic error .",
    "the 3-dimensional case is slightly different and more delicate than the case of 4 dimensions ; in the latter only even powers of @xmath78 must be used ( @xmath79 in eq.([extrapolationfit ] ) ) , along with possible logarithms . in 3 dimensions",
    "one must also use odd negative powers of @xmath43 , since the main difference between a sum over discrete values of momenta and the corresponding integral comes from omitting the contribution of the zero mode .",
    "this quantity behaves like @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a sphere of diameter @xmath82 .",
    "we see that @xmath83 .    using larger lattices",
    "is of course computationally more feasible in 3 dimensions . at the same time",
    ", it is also more necessary than in 4-d , since the infrared behaviour of loop integrals worsens in 3-d .",
    "suffice it to recall that 4-loop integrals in three dimensions will bring about a genuine divergence , requiring introduction of an ir regulator .",
    "@xmath59  referring to diagrams 22 - 36 , integration in 3-d with use of an ir regulator ( in our case , @xmath43 ) may give extra terms which do not exist in the 4-d case , leading to potentially wrong results , when the regulator is taken to its limit value ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "due to the presence of a loop involving two propagators at the same momentum , each of these diagrams exhibits a behaviour of the type :      after summing all diagrams and extrapolating to the limit @xmath84 , the result we get has the form @xmath86 ( terms like @xmath87 add up to zero ) .",
    "of course , the terms @xmath88 are spurious and must not be taken into account .",
    "a similar procedure in 4 dimensions leads instead to :      so that spurious terms are absent : @xmath90 . to solve this problem ,",
    "we can write the mathematical expression for each vertex involved in diagrams 22 - 36 ( fig . 2 ) in a subtracted way : @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the momentum on external lines . once all the subtracted vertices are summed , the terms @xmath93 cancel among themselves .",
    "in addition to that , the terms @xmath94 are at least of first order in @xmath92 and factors of the type @xmath95 involved in eq .",
    "( [ spurious ] ) can not arise .",
    "the subtracted diagrams take the form @xmath96 and thus , extrapolation gives the desired results @xmath97 .",
    "for the case @xmath58 , the value @xmath99 improves a previous estimate @xmath100  @xcite , which was obtained with the method of stochastic perturbation theory ; it allows for a more stable extraction of the `` finite '' part of the gluon condensate , as expressed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( using the notation of that reference for the symbols @xmath45 ) : @xmath101\\biggr\\}\\ ] ] where the logarithmic coefficient @xmath102 is known from the continuum vacuum energy density in the @xmath2 scheme : @xmath103 and @xmath104 requires a 4-loop calculation in lattice perturbation theory .    @xmath59  a possible extension of the present calculation to 4 loops is feasible with the techniques used in this paper , but one must take into account some additional difficulties : first of all there is a total of 250 diagrams to be calculated ( 43 pure gluon diagrams , 115 diagrams with one ghost loop , 37 diagrams with two ghost loops , 4 diagrams with three ghost loops and 51 diagrams with measure terms ) and computation time is proportional to @xmath105 ( in most diagrams , loop integrals are factorizable , with the exception of a `` nonplanar '' diagram and its two ghost variants ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the existence of a genuine logarithmic divergence , one must insert an ir cutoff @xmath106 leading to results of the form @xmath107 .",
    "of course , the vertices and the contracted expressions , as well as a 4-loop version of our integrator , can still be produced automatically in this case ."
