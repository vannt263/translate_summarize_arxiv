    "[ fig:1][fig:4 ] , the resonances occur ( i.e. , the mixing is maximal ) when the energy levels in presence of matter approach each other as function of the matter density @xmath261 .",
    "as the mass squared differences approach each other in magnitude , the resonances move closer together and the mixing angle @xmath270 , which looks quite flat ( constant ) at large separations of the mass squared differences , will have a modest increase above the location of the ( higher ) resonance of the mixing angle @xmath271 . the smaller the vacuum mixing angles are , the shaper are the resonance peaks . for bimaximal mixing",
    "the resonance occurs only for the small mixing angle , but even for matter densities above the resonance region the values of the auxiliary mixing angles are changed appreciably from their vacuum values , as is shown in fig .",

    "this corresponds to an enhancement of @xmath213 and @xmath214 at the same value of @xmath261 , whereas the probability @xmath215 wiggles in the same region .",
    "due to unitarity only three of these probabilities are of course independent .    the cayley ",
    "hamilton formalism could in principle be used to derive neutrino oscillation formulas in matter for arbitrary numbers of neutrino flavors .",
    "however , the calculations for four or even more flavors will be much more tedious than in the case of three neutrino flavors . for four or more flavors ,",
    "the unitary mixing matrices have more complicated structures than in the three flavor case .",
    "another complication , for more than four flavors , is that one will not , in general , be able to find analytical solutions to the characteristic equation , since only characteristic equations up to degree four are analytically solvable .    in appendix  [ app :",

    "apart from the masses , we will take the momentum as a common independent variable and assume that the momentum is the same for all components of the mixed state .",
