    "phase transitions under non - equilibrium conditions have attracted with a great deal of attention in statistical - mechanical problems@xcite .",
    "there have been many investigations on non - equilibrium phase transitions so far@xcite , which have revealed a fascinating new transition behavior different from equilibrium transition . in general ,",
    "probability distribution in non - equilibrium can not be expressed in terms of only energy functional , which causes a difficulty in theoretical study .",
    "recently another class of non - equilibrium systems that exhibits a phase transition has been studied@xcite , in which two different degrees of freedom coupled to their own heat baths interact with each other through multi - body interactions . for simplicity ,",
    "time scales of these two variables are assumed to be well separated .",
    "then , the systems consist of slow and fast variables belonging to different time hierarchy .",
    "the fast variables behave in quasi - equilibrium for a given set of slow variables that plays a role as quenched variables for the fast ones .",
    "meanwhile , the slow variables are not given by independent distribution function as in quenched disordered systems but affected through mean force of fluctuating fast variables .",
    "such systems with a hierarchy in seperated time scales and different heat baths are here called `` two - temperature '' system .",
    "these systems are adopted to describe neural network systems with a synaptic evolution@xcite , evolving networks@xcite , and some kind of nmr systems@xcite .",
    "in contrast to most of non - equilibrium systems , the steady - state distribution of the models is formally expressed in terms of the energy function using the replica method that is a standard tool for studying thermodynamic properties of the quenched disordered systems@xcite .",
    "the replica formalism for two - temperature systems has been introduced in refs .  [ ] . while the quenched disordered systems require the replica limit in which the replica number takes to be zero , the two - temperature systems have a physical meaning for any value of the replica number which corresponds to a ratio of two temperatures . in this sense , this is regarded as a generalization of quenched systems and is sometimes called as partial annealing system@xcite .",
    "a most crutial difference from the quenched systems is that the slow variables are also dynamical coupled to their heat bath .",
    "therefore , both the slow and fast variables are responsible for phase transition . this could provide a new cooperative phenomenon over different time scale .",
    "in fact , allahverdyan and petrosyan , hereafter referred to as ap , studied a mean - field spin model as a two - temperature system and found that the model exhibited a first - order phase transition with anomalous negative latent heat , which never occurs in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "however , this peculiar behavior observed in the two - temperature system is not well understood .",
    "we pursue phase transition in the two - temperature systems and give a general condition that the system exhibits the negative latent heat with the help of the idea of thermodynamics .",
    "it is also found that , in the systems , two different entropys associated with the fast and slow variables respectively play a competitive role in determing the phase boundary of first - order transition .",
    "we further studied two - temprature version of a spin - lattice - gas model , similar to that studied by ap , as a specific example .",
    "the spin - lattice - gas model consists of two degrees of freedom , spins and particles , which has been studied for a given hamiltonian in equilibrium@xcite .",
    "the two - temperature version is characterized by not only the hamiltonian but also the order of time scales of two variables .",
    "ap studied the case where the spins were slow and the particles were fast .",
    "we study this case with some modified hamiltonian and also the other case , namely the spins and particles behave as fast and slow variables , respectively .",
    "we then find that the existence of the negative latent heat is common to both cases , suggesting that it is observed in a wide class of the two - temperature systems . on the other hand , qualitatively different behavior",
    "is also found in phase diagram of the two cases , in particluar , the stability of ferromagnetic ordered phase .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] , we review the replica formalism of the two - temperature system , which leads to an equilibrium model of a replicated system .",
    "we also discuss phase boundary of first - order transition and derive a clausius - clapeyron relation in this system .",
    "this relation enables us to find generally a geometric property of the phase boundary and the negative latent heat . in sec .",

    "these variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in contact with their different heat bath with temperature @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the two characteristic time scales on the variables @xmath2 and @xmath1 are well separated from each other and that the thermal average of the fast variable @xmath1 can be taken with a fixed configuration of the slow variable @xmath2 .",
    "then , the conditional probability @xmath5 of finding a configuration @xmath1 for a given @xmath2 at the inverse temperature @xmath6 is defined @xmath7 where the normalization constant or the partition function of the fast variable is set as @xmath8 hereafter the boltzmann constant is set to be unity .",
    "one can define partial free energy for the fast variable as @xmath9 .",
    "the steady - state probability of slow variables @xmath10 is derived by an adiabatic approximation of two - temperature langevin equation @xcite .",
    "the force acting on @xmath2 is assumed to be an averaged derivative of the hamiltonian with respect to the slow variable over the conditional probability , which is represented by the partial free energy as @xmath11 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution @xmath10 at the inverse temperature @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 the total free energy @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 .",
    "using the replica trick , the model can be mapped onto an equilibrium problem with a replicated hamiltonian for the integer number of ratio @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes replicated fast variables .",
    "this could be extended to any real value of the ratio @xmath20 after calculating the replicated system in a standard manner of the replica method .",
    "while one takes the replica limit @xmath21 for the quenched disordered system like spin glasses , any value of @xmath22 makes a sense as the two - temperature system in this context .",
    "this formalism is also interpreted as a kind of statistical - mechanical problems with randomness . in particular , note that the distribution of the random variables is determined by not only a given independent function but also the thermal averaged quantity of the fast variables .",
    "the latter leads to a non - trivial correlation among the slow variables .",

    "it should be noted that the free energy is also rewritten by @xmath33 averaging over the fast variables @xmath1 , the thermodynamic structure is found by regarding the averaged partial free energy @xmath34 as an `` _ _ energy _ _ '' for the slow variable @xmath2 .",
    "namely , the averaged partial free energy and the entropy @xmath35 for the slow variables decrease monotonically with decreasing @xmath4 .    as a consequence of the thermodynamic structure@xcite ,",
    "a clausius - clapeyron like relation for two - temperature systems is derived , which gives us a topological property of a first - order - transition line .",

    "the free - energy difference @xmath52 is also expressed as @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the internal energy @xmath55 .",

    "<S> as a specific example , phase diagram of a spin - lattice gas model is studied based on a mean - field analysis with replica method . </S>",
    "<S> while configurational variables are spin and particle in this model , it is found that the negative latent heat appears in a parameter region of the model , irrespective of the order of their time scale . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative differences in the phase diagram are also discussed . </S>"
