    "in two dimensions , particles are no longer constrained to obey bose or fermi statistics .",
    "it is possible for an exchange of identical particles to result in the multiplication of the wavefunction by an arbitrary phase factor @xmath2 , not just -1 or + 1 @xcite .",
    "particles with such properties are called _ anyons _ @xcite .",
    "there exists an even more exotic possibility . if there is a set of @xmath3 degenerate states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , for anyons with identical configurations , exchanging particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 can rotate one state into another in the space spanned by the @xmath4 s : @xmath8 there is no reason to expect the matrices @xmath9 to commute in general , and when they do not commute , the particles are said to obey non - abelian braiding statistics @xcite .",
    "the transformation eq.([eq : staterot ] ) is possible because , in two dimensions , particle exchange represents a topologically nontrivial manipulation .",
    "external potentials or impurities , if weak enough , can not induce such a transformation , so the @xmath10-fold degeneracy is unaffected by such perturbations .",
    "these characteristics make non - abelian systems attractive candidates for fault - tolerant computation @xcite",
    ". there exist possible quantum hall states where the braiding rules for a set of @xmath11 quasiparticles coincide with the braiding rules for @xmath11-point conformal blocks in the level-@xmath12 su(2 ) wess - zumino - witten model . in the case",
    "@xmath13 , these braiding rules can be used to construct a universal quantum computer @xcite . in particular a universal set of quantum gates realized by anyon braiding in a @xmath13 system has been found @xcite .",
    "although it is not adequate for quantum computation , the @xmath14 case has received more attention .",
    "this is partly because it is simpler but also because there is experimental @xcite and numerical evidence @xcite that such a system actually exists in the @xmath1 quantum hall system @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0 quantum hall state is a possible candidate for the @xmath13 case , although evidence is not as strong .",
    "consequently it is of interest to construct a readout scheme for the @xmath13 case similar to the @xmath14 scheme exhibited in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that in the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillation experiment similar to the one proposed for the @xmath15 quantum hall system @xcite , the @xmath0 quantum hall system will show the effects of its non - abelian statistics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the analysis of the ab oscillation experiment in the @xmath15 quantum hall system . in section iii",
    ", we show how to construct the non - abelian quantum hall state at @xmath0 . in section iv ,",
    "we present our main result , the analysis of the ab oscillation in the @xmath0 quantum hall system .",
    "section v is a conclusion and discussion .",
    "the basic scheme for the experiment in both filling fractions @xmath15 and @xmath0 is a two point - contact interferometer composed of a quantum hall bar with two front gates that is shown in fig.[fig : ab ] @xcite . by biasing the front gates",
    ", we can create constrictions in the hall bar , and so adjust the tunneling amplitude of @xmath16 and @xmath17 across the constrictions .",
    "the tunneling between opposite - edge currents leads to deviations of @xmath18 from its quantized value , or equivalently , to the appearance of @xmath19 .",
    "this @xmath19 can be measured by connecting one edge to a constant current source and measuring the voltage drop across the other edge . for this experiment ,",
    "the interest is on the case where the tunneling amplitudes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are small .",
    "this must be so in order to ensure that the tunneling current is entirely due to lowest charge ( @xmath20 ) quasiholes with no contribution from higher charge composites @xcite .    to the lowest order in @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the tunneling current and , hence , longitudinal conductivity @xmath19 in this system will be proportional to the probability that current entering the bottom edge leaves through the top edge @xcite : @xmath21 in this expression , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the unitary evolution operators for a quasihole taking the two respective paths , and @xmath24 is the initial state of the system . in the third line ,",
    "the operator @xmath25 is the transformation solely due to the braiding statistics of winding a single quasihole around @xmath26 quasiholes @xcite , and @xmath27 is the abelian phase factor that includes the ab phase .    in this section",
    ", we will consider @xmath28 for the @xmath26 quasiholes in the interferometer in the case @xmath1 .",
    "the essential point is that this operator @xmath25 does not probe individually the local properties of the quasiholes , because in this experiment , these @xmath26 quasiholes are seen only as a single composite entity .",
    "therefore one first needs to consider what is the fusion rule for these anyons .",
    "it is known , through the machinery of conformal field theory , that the moore - read state can be built from the @xmath29 ising anyon model .",
    "this model has three particle types , conventionally denoted as : @xmath30 ( vacuum ) , @xmath31 ( spin / vortex ) , and @xmath32 ( majorana fermion ) .",
    "its non - trivial fusion rules are : @xmath33 ( note that the magnetic flux of the quasiholes does not show up in this formalism . however , that is a less interesting issue , since for all cases , the flux can be accounted for by some abelian phase factors . )",
    "eq.([eq : isingfusion ] ) tells us that for the case @xmath26 even , the composite can turn out to be either @xmath30 or @xmath32 , whereas for @xmath26 odd it can only be @xmath31 .",
    "but ( [ eq : isingfusion ] ) also tells us that fusion of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( not to mention @xmath31 and @xmath30 ) has a unique result .",
    "therefore the operator @xmath25 , which is equivalent to encircling a @xmath31 , representing the tunneling quasihole , around the composite in the island , would only lead to wavefunction modification by some phase factor in this case .",
    "diagrammatically this means that a diagram where one particle winds around another can be reduced to an unwound diagram .",
    "the phase factor has been worked out @xcite , and @xmath25 in this case is effectively reduced to the diagrammatic braiding rules worked out by bonderson _",

    "although one can diagonalize @xmath36 for this case ( where ` @xmath37 ' in the superscript represents the tunneling quasihole and ` @xmath38 ' the composite particle in the island ) , there are two different eigenvalues in this case @xcite .",

    "it is important to consider the meaning of the initial state @xmath24 .",
    "it includes not only the internal state of the quasiholes in the island but also the edge state as well .",
    "this is so because the operator @xmath25 should involve creation and annihilation of the chiral @xmath31 field at the edge if it is to account for tunneling of a quasihole . in this sense ,",
    "the diagrammatic calculation performed here is taking the expectation value over tunneling quasiholes as well @xcite .",

    "in addition , the s matrix is unitary @xcite . for the ising model ,",
    "these results , together with the results we have from the diagrams ( [ eq : braiding1 ] ) and ( [ eq : braiding2 ] ) , enable us to obtain all the elements of the s matrix , and thus evaluate the diagram ( [ eq : link1 ] ) .    an alternative way to calculate",
    "the diagram ( [ eq : link1 ] ) , which we shall employ in our analysis of the @xmath0 case , is to view it as involving not two , but four @xmath31 particles .",

    "( in case of @xmath13 , this would be equivalent to the three - state potts model @xcite . ) in such a model , there would be a  spin \" variable @xmath31 on each site , taking @xmath12 values @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 if the system is at a critical point , one can treat @xmath51 as a continuous conformal field @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the critical theory retains the @xmath45-symmetry ,",

    "the lattice model of eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) is self - dual for these cases @xcite , which can be seen by generalizing the case of the ising model treated in @xcite . to obtain the correlation function @xmath64",
    ", we must first calculate a transformed partition function , in which the hamiltonian eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) is modified by @xmath65 in eq.([eq : disordertrans ] ) , @xmath66 if the link is not on a path @xmath67 connecting @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "but if the link @xmath70 is on @xmath67 , either @xmath71 or @xmath72 ( so that if @xmath67 is closed , the modification results in the mapping to an equivalent problem where all spins in sites inside gets multiplied by @xmath73 ) , hence the term ` disorder ' for @xmath63 variables .",
    "the correlation function @xmath74 is the ratio of this transformed partition function to the original partition function .",
    "since @xmath75 can be treated as @xmath76 when the system is at a critical point , eq.([eq : disordertrans ] ) tells us that @xmath56 and @xmath77 are mutually _ semilocal _ with the mutual locality exponent of @xmath78 .",
    "that is , one would pick up a phase of @xmath79 when @xmath56 winds counterclockwise around @xmath77 or vice versa .",
    "this result can be generalized to any @xmath12 values @xcite .",
    "a useful analogy in thinking about the mutual locality exponent is to regard @xmath56 as possessing charge @xmath80 and @xmath76 as possessing vortex winding @xmath81 ; the negative of this vortex winding is termed the dual @xmath82 charge .",
    "( a similar conclusion can be also obtained from the @xmath83-villain model treated in @xcite . )",
    "given the formulation of @xmath76 given here , it is natural that there exists dual @xmath84 invariance @xmath85 for arbitrary integer @xmath86 .",
    "one can regard the @xmath45 parafermion field @xmath87 as a holomorphic field originating from fusing @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath90 charge of @xmath87 is @xmath91 .",
    "one result of this formulation is that the @xmath87 s are not mutually local ; between @xmath87 and @xmath92 the mutual locality exponent is @xmath93 .",
    "( together with the conservation of @xmath94 charge , this sets both the conformal dimension and its spin at @xmath95 @xcite . )",
    "let us now consider the problem of constructing the electron operator from @xmath87 .",
    "one wants to obtain an anticommuting fermion operator with the least possible flux attached to it @xcite . in order to do so , one should set @xmath96 and obtain @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a chiral free boson uniquely defined by the two - point correlation function @xmath99 .",
    "( note that from this point on , as we will be dealing with quantum hall states , we are interested only in the holomorphic part of our conformal fields . )",
    "this sets the mutual locality exponent of the vertex operator part ( and flux attached to one electron in units of @xmath100 ) at @xmath101 , and therefore the electron operator of eq.([eq : electron ] ) is mutually local .",
    "( note that for any value of @xmath12 , this operator has the conformal dimension of 3/2 . ) the wavefunction obtained by read and rezayi was constructed by taking the many - point correlation function of the electron operator of eq.([eq : electron ] ) .",
    "for @xmath13 it turns out to be @xcite @xmath102    the next step is to determine the quasihole operator for @xmath13 . before doing this we need to consider the complete fusion rules for the @xmath103 potts model .",
    "these are @xcite : @xmath104 and @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 s are the primary field of the parafermion algebra .",
    "( note that for @xmath107 , the labeling scheme we are using here follows read and rezayi @xcite which is different from what is used in @xcite . ) since we are only concerned with the holomorphic part of these fields here , the operator product expansions ( opes ) need to be modified from their original result in the three - state potts model .",
    "this is exactly analogous to the situation in the @xmath29 ising model . in this holomorphic",
    "setting , the conformal dimensions of fields are @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . as a result",
    "the least singular ope that emerges between @xmath111 and @xmath107 or @xmath112 is @xcite @xmath113 there are two condition for constructing the quasihole operator .",
    "one is that it should have the least possible charge , or equivalently , least flux attached .",
    "the other is that it should be mutually local with the electron operator @xcite .",
    "eq.([eq : ope1 ] ) tells us that @xmath114 needs to be included to satisfy the first condition .",
    "the vertex operator part then needs to be adjusted to satisfy the second condition .",
    "( in order to satisfy the second condition one needs @xmath115 to be an integer , where @xmath116 is the fusion product of electron and quasihole operators @xcite . )",
    "the answer we get is @xmath117    now with eq.([eq : qh ] ) , the wavefunction with quasiholes can be constructed : @xmath118 we have seen that the electron operator is mutually local to both electrons and quasiholes .",
    "consequently the many - electron wavefunction in ( [ eq : parawf2 ] ) is analytic in the electron coordinate , the fractional exponent of the laughlin - like term being canceled out by the parafermion correlation function part .",
    "the filling fraction for this wavefunction is determined entirely by the laughlin factor .",
    "this gives @xmath119 @xcite . in order to obtain @xmath120 from the wavefunction in ( [ eq : parawf2 ] ) , we need to fill the first landau level with electrons of both spins and then apply a particle - hole transformation to the second landau level . from the exponent of the @xmath121 term in eq.([eq : parawf2 ] ) , one can see that the electric charge of a quasihole is @xmath122 in the parafermion @xmath123 quantum hall state @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 state is obtained by applying particle - hole transformation on the @xmath119 state , the quasiholes of eq.([eq : parawf2 ] ) becomes excitations with the charge @xmath124 in the parafermion @xmath0 quantum hall state .",
    "conversely , there exists charge @xmath125 excitations , such as the ones on the antidot @xcite , which originate from quasielectron excitations of the @xmath119 state .    for most of the next section ,",
    "the case of the @xmath119 parafermion state will be considered , the particle - hole inversion being applied at the end .",
    "the inversion will result in inverting the signs of both the quasiparticle charge and the statistical angle .",
    "as stated at the end of the last section , this section will chiefly deal with the ab interference that would arise if eq.([eq : parawf2 ] ) is the second landau level _ electron _ wavefunction .",
    "however , for @xmath0 , the wavefunction eq.([eq : parawf2 ] ) should be that of _ holes _ , not electrons .",
    "one can consider an analogous situation in an abelian fractional quantum hall state .",
    "there , the sign of the charge would be reversed while that of the flux remains the same . as a result , the sign of the nontrivial phase that gets accumulated when one quasihole encircles another is reversed .",
    "there should be the same reversal of the sign of the phase in this interference also .",
    "however it should be noted that in this case not all phase comes from the abelian @xmath126 sector ; reversal of sign of the charge alone can not explain this sign reversal .",
    "one can formulate this sign change precisely by applying girvin s particle - hole transformation in the lowest landau level @xcite , which include taking the complex conjugates of the quasiparticle coordinates .",
    "one thing to be noticed from eq.([eq : fusionpotts ] ) is that fusions involving @xmath127 produce a single operator and not a sum of operators .",
    "this indicates that the braiding @xmath127 s only contribute abelian phase factors , and that in the case of braiding , replacing @xmath114 or @xmath128 with @xmath112 will only result in changing the phase factor . with these consideration ,",
    "the conclusion is that all non - abelian statistics in this model can be derived from the fusion rule eq.([eq : fibofusion ] ) of the @xmath112 particles .",
    "this is a very important point because eq.([eq : fibofusion ] ) is equivalent to the fusion rule for the fibonacci anyons discussed by preskill @xcite , with @xmath112 as the fibonacci anyon . that braids of these fibonacci anyons can yield universal quantum computation",
    "was explicitly shown by bonesteel _",
    "@xcite ( fibonacci anyons may also be realized in quantum spin systems @xcite and rotating bose condensates @xcite . )    the question now is whether there is any way one can probe the internal state of these anyons using the method explained in section ii . in other words ,",
    "we need to see if different internal states can lead to different results for eq.([eq : tunnel ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the system of fibonacci anyons .",
    "braiding in such a system would differ from that of the @xmath13 parafermion state only by some phase factors which we will calculate later .",
    "for this system , one can always have either @xmath30 or @xmath112 when two or more anyons are fused .",
    "( this fusion result is termed _",
    "anyonic charge_. this charge is conserved in the braiding transformation . ) in this probe , since anyons in the interferometer are seen only as a single entity , they form a two - state system ; in this sense , they can be considered to have formed a qubit .",
    "if the result of fusing all the quasiholes in the interferometer is @xmath30 , @xmath25 should be the same as it is for the ising model in the diagram ( [ eq : braiding1 ] ) . therefore @xmath129 ; except for some phase factors , which we will deal with later , the ab oscillation should be the same as the case with no quasiholes in the island .",
    "the situation is quite different if the fusion result is @xmath112 . since in this interferometer , evaluating @xmath28 involves taking standard closure to the worldlines of particles @xcite , just as in the case of the @xmath29 ising model , the diagram to be evaluated is : @xmath130(2.7,2.0 )    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta ] ( 1.7,1.0){0.5}{180}{360 }    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta ] ( 1,1.0){0.5}{0}{180 }    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta , border=4pt ] ( 1,1.0){0.5}{180}{360 }    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta , border=4pt ] ( 1.7,1.0){0.5}{0}{180 }    \\rput[bl]{0}(0.15,0.9){$\\varepsilon$ }    \\rput[bl]{0}(2.35,0.9){$\\varepsilon$ }    \\endpspicture\\ ] ] ( for our purpose , all propagators are set to unity , as they were in section ii .",
    "furthermore , all unlinked loops are normalized to unity . )     and the second @xmath131 . here",

    "therefore , the diagram ( [ eq : fibobraiding ] ) can be evaluated in exactly the same way as the diagram ( [ eq : link1 ] ) .",
    "again one can consider the situation where two pairs of @xmath112 particles are created out of vacuum , and one @xmath112 particle from one pair is wound counterclockwise around one @xmath112 particle from the other pair ; the diagram ( [ eq : fibobraiding ] ) is equal to the amplitude of the fusion result of both pairs being vacuum . from eq.([eq : tunnel ] ) , one can see that this amplitude would be equal to the amplitude of the ab oscillation up to a possible phase factor .",
    "this in turn means that for the @xmath0 quantum hall state , the internal state of quasiholes in the island region determine the amplitude of oscillation .",
    "unlike in the case of the @xmath1 quantum hall state , the amplitude of oscillation is not determined by the number of quasiholes in the island .",
    "now the task is to calculate the diagram ( [ eq : fibobraiding ] ) .",
    "the elementary braid transformations for fibonacci anyons were derived in @xcite , and the corresponding transformation matrices in the three - anyon system in the basis @xmath134 is given in @xcite .",
    "in particular the matrix for interchanging the second and third anyons in this basis is @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "the natural way to generalize this basis to a four - anyon system would be to take the @xmath137 basis shown in fig.[fig : bases ] .",
    "if we are to consider the transformation @xmath138 in which the second anyon winds around the third anyon , the last fusion result @xmath38 is unaffected by this transformation , so the transformation matrix will come out in a block - diagonal form in this basis .",
    "therefore one obtains the following relation : @xmath139 from eq.([eq : fibobraid0 ] ) and eq.([eq : threefour ] ) one can obtain the following matrix for this winding transformation in the @xmath140 basis : @xmath141    the diagram ( [ eq : fibobraiding ] ) , however , needs to be calculated in the other basis of fig.[fig : bases ] , for it is equal to @xmath142 .",
    "note that @xmath143 unless @xmath144 and @xmath145 . since there is only one state in the @xmath146 basis with @xmath144 and @xmath147 , for some real number @xmath148 , @xmath149    the amplitude for the ab oscillation when the result of fusing all quasiholes in the interferometer is @xmath112 can be given now : @xmath150(2.7,2.0 )    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta ] ( 1.7,1.0){0.5}{180}{360 }    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta ] ( 1,1.0){0.5}{0}{180 }    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta , border=4pt ] ( 1,1.0){0.5}{180}{360 }    \\psarc[linewidth=1.5pt , linecolor = magenta , border=4pt ] ( 1.7,1.0){0.5}{0}{180 }    \\rput[bl]{0}(0.15,0.9){$\\varepsilon$ }    \\rput[bl]{0}(2.35,0.9){$\\varepsilon$ }    \\endpspicture    \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\langle ( ( \\bullet , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } , ( \\bullet , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } ) _ { \\mathbb{i } } | \\hat{u } | ( ( \\bullet , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } , ( \\bullet , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } ) _ { \\mathbb{i } } \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\langle ( ( ( \\bullet , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } , \\bullet)_{\\varepsilon } , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } | \\hat{u } | ( ( ( \\bullet , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } , \\bullet)_{\\varepsilon } , \\bullet)_{\\mathbb{i } } \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\    & = & -(1-\\tau ) = -\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2 } \\approx -0.382.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that there is also the phase factor of -1 .",
    "( from preskill @xcite , one can easily obtain the s matrix for the fibonacci anyon model .",
    "this is possible because the braiding involving the vacuum is trivial and the s matrix here is a @xmath151 unitary matrix .",
    "the s matrix obtained in this way agrees with the amplitude of ab oscillation in eq.([eq : ampfibo ] ) . )",
    "some phase factors were lost by identifying the @xmath107 s with @xmath112 and the @xmath127 s with @xmath30 .",
    "two points need to be made in order to figure these out .",
    "first , from eq.([eq : fusionpotts ] ) , @xmath114 can be regarded as resulting from fusing the fibonacci anyon @xmath112 and the parafermion @xmath152 : the quasihole tunneling can be regarded as tunneling of the composite of the parafermion @xmath152 and the fibonacci anyon @xmath112 .",
    "second , from the operator product expansion @xmath153 one can see that the @xmath127 s are relatively local to @xmath112 - that is , there is no accumulation of nontrivial phase factor when @xmath127 winds around @xmath112 .",
    "therefore the phase factors that need to be calculated comes entirely from @xmath127 s . in other words ,",
    "the phase factors to be considered now originate from the @xmath154 charge of the parafermion .",
    "if the number of quasiholes in the island is @xmath155 , the fusion result is @xmath156 ( if @xmath157 there can not be a fusion result of @xmath152 , of course . )",
    "so the effect that had been ignored is that of encircling @xmath152 counterclockwise around each other . from section iii .",
    "this phase factor can be found from the mutual locality exponent - the phase factor is @xmath158 .",
    "similarly , @xmath159 here the phase factor is the same as the one that arises when @xmath111 circles counterclockwise around @xmath152 , or vice versa , which turns out to be @xmath160 .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath161 gives rise to no further phase factor .",
    "this shows that whereas the number of quasiholes in the interferometer does not determine the amplitude of the oscillation , it does induce phase shift in the oscillation .",
    "the phase shift due to the electric charge and magnetic flux of quasiholes now needs to be accounted for . for the quantum hall state of eq.([eq : parawf2 ] ) , the quasihole has charge of @xmath122 and flux of @xmath162 , the flux phase factor that arises when one quasihole is added is @xmath163 . combining these two phase shifts",
    ", we see that there is a @xmath164 phase shift per one quasihole .",
    "we now have the result of eq.([eq : tunnel ] ) for the @xmath0 parafermion quantum hall state , keeping in mind , however , that the particle - hole inversion gives a negative sign to these phase shifts due to the quasiholes . in this case",
    "the fusion result of @xmath26 quasiholes in the island region would have the three - state potts label of @xmath30 , @xmath111 or @xmath152 : @xmath165 .",
    "\\label{eq : result1}\\ ] ] otherwise the three - state potts label of the fusion result would be @xmath112 , @xmath128 or @xmath114 and one would have @xmath166 .",
    "\\label{eq : result2}\\ ] ] the first two phase terms , @xmath167 , can be varied by changing @xmath168 .",
    "since the quasiparticle charge is @xmath122 , the period of ab oscillation is @xmath169 .",
    "as far as the phase of the oscillation is concerned , eqs.([eq : result1 ] ) and ( [ eq : result2 ] ) give the same result as the hierarchial @xmath170 quantum hall state ; the non - abelian nature of the parafermion quantum hall state is manifest only through the changed amplitude of the oscillation in eq.([eq : result2 ] ) .",
    "as analyzed above , comparing the ab oscillation in the @xmath171 5/2 and 12/5 quantum hall states shows that different fusion rules leads to qualitatively different results .",
    "the biggest difference is that , unlike the @xmath1 case , there is no instance in the @xmath172 case where the interference vanishes due to the number of quasiholes in the island region .",
    "in fact , in the case of @xmath172 for any number of quasiholes in the interferometer , the change in the amplitude of oscillation due to the internal state of the quasiholes occur in the same manner",
    ".    this paper does not present a complete readout scheme for the internal state of the quasiholes of the @xmath0 quantum hall state to the extent done in the @xmath173 superconductor @xcite .",
    "given a set of quasiholes , their total anyonic charge is conserved in any topological process .",
    "this means that , in the case that the quasiholes inside the interferometer are not in a state with definite total anyonic charge , it is not possible to obtain some of the phase relations between coefficients in the superposition state . even if the",
    "anyonic charge is fixed , as we saw in section iv , once there are three or more quasiholes , they can be in a linear superposition of more than one internal state .",
    "it is impossible to probe the internal hilbert space of such a quasihole cluster unless we can move the quasiholes adiabatically out of the interferometer region .",
    "in addition , if we are to obtain any phase relation between the coefficients , we must be able to braid quasiholes adiabatically . without introducing such additional features",
    ", we can not extract the coefficients of the internal quasihole superposition state from this interference experiment .",
    "lastly it should be noted that for these  qubits \" , the initialization process is not known .",
    "so far , it is not clear how one can prepare quantum mechanically pure states ; more work needs to be done in this direction .",
    "while this paper was in preparation , the authors learned about a similar work by p.  bonderson , k.  shtengel , and j.  k.  slingerland @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the monodromy matrix element can be written in terms of the s matrix . by obtaining s matrix for the general @xmath45 parafermion theory",
    ", they obtained the same conclusion on the phase and amplitude of ab oscillation presented in this paper .",
    "s.c . would like to thank n.  bonesteel for explaining the connection between fibonacci anyons and their connection to @xmath174 algebra , p.  bonderson and k.  shtengel for both illuminating explanation of the result of their previous paper @xcite , and their comments on this paper , and b.  i.  halperin and s.  h.  simon for their discussion on the issue of the sign of quasiparticle charge in the two - point contact quantum hall interferometry .",
