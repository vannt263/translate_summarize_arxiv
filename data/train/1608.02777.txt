    "the @xmath4cdm model , known as the standard model of cosmology , is constructed with the assumption that the cosmological constant term , @xmath4 , dominates the recent accelerated evolution of the universe , along with a dark component of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and the baryonic visible matter .",
    "the dark matter ( dm ) component obviously does not interact electromagnetically with the baryonic matter .",
    "such model is in good agreement with recent observational data @xcite . although being the best model in explaining the observational data , some concerns about its origin and the great discrepancy between the theoretical and the expected value of the cosmological constant term are yet open questions @xcite .",
    "even other important issue is why does we live in a special phase of the cosmic evolution where the contribution of @xmath4 is of the same order of magnitude of the baryonic and dark matter components .",
    "this is known as _ cosmic coincidence problem_.    in the same line of models based on a cosmological term , more general scenarios considering a time varying cosmic term have been recently proposed in the literature . the main aim of these models is to explain the effect of recent acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "such models are called @xmath5 cosmology or vacuum decay cosmology , but its theoretical motivation and nature also constitutes an open question .",
    "part of these works are motivated by corrections to the vacuum energy in theories of renormalization group @xcite .",
    "according to the general framework , the vacuum quantum fluctuations are the source of a vacuum energy density that depends on the space - time curvature . after a renormalization procedure",
    ", the divergent vacuum contribution is subtracted and the resulting effective energy density is allowed to decay into dm particles @xcite .",
    "models in which the cosmological term are absent but its effects are mimicked by an exotic fluid of negative pressure filling the whole universe are called dark energy ( de ) models .",
    "several models of de have been studied recently @xcite , including models of scalar field , exotic fluids or interacting de - dm models .",
    "in addition to the models that use standard scalar fields as de or dm candidates , recent works have shown that there is a new kind of non - standard spinor with interesting `` dark '' properties which could be useful in order to describe both dm as de .",
    "it is named elko ( _ eigenspinoren des ladungskonjugationsoperators _ ) and was proposed by by ahluwalia - khalilova and grumiller @xcite ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "after its discovery , several theoretical aspects of the elko spinor field has been studied @xcite and also some interesting cosmological applications @xcite .",
    "the searching for such kind of particle at cern lhc has also been addressed recently @xcite .    since the elko spinor is a genuine fermion , it is possible to envisage its coupling also to torsion fields , investigating its cosmological consequences @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the complete equations of a elko spinor field coupled to gravity in an einstein - cartan framework and show that a slowly varying elko spinor field presents the same behavior of a time varying cosmic term , which leads to a dark energy evolution .",
    "as we have already emphasized , varying cosmic term models may be understood as a sort of _ ad hoc _ approaches to the cosmic evolution problem .",
    "therefore , it is indeed relevant to obtain its cosmological behavior from the field theory realm .",
    "moreover , we show that the positivity of the elko mass leads to a nearly null self - coupling for quartic vertex .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii briefly presents the main properties of the elko spinor field ; section iii , together with the appendix , present the equations of the elko field into an einstein - cartan framework ; section iv concerns the slowly varying elko spinor field and section v presents the observational constraint .",
    "the conclusions are left to section vi .",
    "more or less recently , a new class of spinor fields have been proposed in the literature @xcite , with several interesting properties , both from theoretical and phenomenological reasons . such new class of spinors , the so - called elko spinors , in contrast to the dirac spinor field , perform a complete set of eigenspinors of the charge conjugate operator , endowing the spinor field of darkness , i. e. , the spinors are neutral with respect to gauge interactions .",
    "moreover , these spinors are shown to have canonical mass dimension one , instead of three - half . all together",
    ", the field construction reveals a quite interesting dm or even de candidate . as an aside ( but important ) remark ,",
    "we stress that the quantum field theory no - go theorems @xcite are not applicable to the case in question since the field violate the full lorentz symmetry in a subtle way . actually , the situation can be better explained by making clear some of the main steps of the field construction . in this section",
    "we shall pinpoint these steps in an argumentative ground .",
    "for a comprehensive and up to date review , please see ref .",
    "@xcite .    after the formal development of the elko spinors and the treatment of its basic properties , it is possible to envisage that the theory shows the existence of a preferred direction , jeopardizing the full relativistic symmetry of the theory .",
    "in fact , the naive use of the dirac adjoint leads to a vanishing norm .",
    "there are , however , a judicious construction fully based on relativistic argues which arrives at the right dual to the elko case @xcite .",
    "we mention this last fact because there is an important fingerprint associated to the new dual : the spin sums carries the lorentz broken term , instead of some different term in the dispersion relation .",
    "the associated quantum field inherits this property rendering non - locality , except along a preferred direction .",
    "nevertheless , it was demonstrated that the violation can be recast into subgroups of the lorentz group , just as the groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these subgroups can be obtained from the full lorentz group by removing the discrete symmetry operators and rearranging the remain generators @xcite .",
    "the consequences to the cosmological set up we shall investigate in this work are analyzed bearing in mind a classical spinorial field , taking advantage of previous results @xcite , as the time factorization of the spinor field possibility . in order to accomplish our task , it is important to emphasize once again that the spinor field satisfies only the kelin - gordon equation : the quantum field has a scalar - like propagator , whilst the classical spinor is not annihilated by the dirac operator . in this vein",
    "the lagragian to be associated to the theory has the kinetic term given by @xmath8 . in the following",
    "we shall investigate the elko spinor field coupled to gravity in a einstein - cartan framework , with a friedmann - robertson - walker metric and all the particularities coming from these spacetime specifications are to be encoded into the covariant derivative .",
    "we finalize this section by reinforcing the spinorial character of elko fields , this time calling attention to its ( while a fermion ) coupling to torsion fields . as we are going to see",
    ", the cosmological impact of such possibility is indeed worth to be reported . beyond that",
    ", it is indeed a matter of subtlety the fact that the ( not yet experimentally verified ) torsion fields may be associated to elko dark spinors contributing to describe the behavior of de .",
    "we start introducing the elko spinor action in a general einstein - cartan framework : @xmath9 \\ , , \\label{actione}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the tilde denotes the presence of torsion terms into the ricci scalar @xmath12 and covariant derivatives , namely , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the connection associated to spinor fields , containing the spin connection @xmath16 .",
    "we leave for the appendix a detailed derivation of the basic stuff concerning the field equations , since such program was already carried out by kouwn et al @xcite . from now on ,",
    "the non - vanishing torsion terms are introduced via the @xmath17 and @xmath18 functions .",
    "the elko spinor fields are assumed as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . besides , the normalization @xmath21 will be used without lost of generality .    the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric reads @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a lapse function and @xmath24 is the scale factor of the universe . the lagrangian density that follows from ( [ actione ] ) is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the potential .",
    "the friedmann equations and the equation of motion for @xmath27 can be obtained by studying the euler - lagrange equations coming from ( [ lagran ] ) with respect to @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "first , in order to eliminate the functions encoding the torsion contribution , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we investigate its equations of motion @xmath28 now , the friedmann equation for the energy density can be obtained by taken the euler - lagrange equation with respect to the lapse function @xmath23 ( setting @xmath29 ) , and substituting @xmath18 and @xmath17 from ( [ hf ] ) : @xmath30\\,,\\label{h2}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . in the same fashion , the pressure equation is obtained by taken the euler - lagrange equation with respect to @xmath24 : @xmath32\\,.\\label{hdot}\\ ] ] finally , the equation of motion for @xmath27 reads @xmath33 from the above equations ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ hdot ] ) it is easy to recognize the energy density and pressure for the elko spinor field with torsion .",
    "these quantities are given by @xmath34 @xmath35    several interesting aspects can be noticed in these equations .",
    "first , the euler - lagrange method used to obtain the friedmann equations by variation with respect to the lapse function @xmath23 and the scale factor @xmath24 leads directly to the expressions of energy density and pressure , in contrast to the standard method of introducing an energy - momentum tensor containing terms of spin connections and take its variation with respect to the metric , as done in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor are obtained in the torsionless limit , which corresponds to take @xmath36 in the above equations ( see eqs .",
    "( [ rhoa])-([pa ] ) of the appendix for the energy density and pressure in the null torsion case ) . here",
    "the generalized equations are given by ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ pphi ] ) .",
    "the above equations also allow the analysis of different energy scales for the field @xmath37 , where the torsion effects are important for the elko field . since that @xmath38 , in the limit @xmath39 all the terms @xmath40 in the denominators can be neglected and the torsion free equations are recovered ( see eqs .",
    "( [ h2aa])-([hdotaa ] ) of the appendix ) .",
    "thus , torsion effects are only relevant for @xmath41 .",
    "notice also that in the limit @xmath42 the torsion function behaves as @xmath43 .",
    "a prominent application of the elko spinor field as a candidate to dark energy in the universe reveals itself as far as we consider an almost constant and homogeneous elko spinor field distribution in the whole universe , i. e. , @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to a slowly varying condition to elko spinor field given by @xmath45 in this limit we have the friedmann equations ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ hdot ] ) as : @xmath46\\,,\\label{h2slow}\\ ] ] @xmath47\\,,\\label{hdotslow}\\ ] ] where we have also included by hand standard terms of matter density @xmath48 and matter pressure @xmath49 representing the contributions of matter in the evolution .    in this limit the pressure and energy density of the elko field",
    "are related by : @xmath50 thus , for a slowly varying hubble parameter , @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , an almost vacuum equation of state relation , as desired for a dark energy fluid .    taking a potential that includes a mass term and a self interaction for the elko spinor field , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a dimensionless coupling constant , the friedmann equation ( [ h2slow ] )",
    "can be written as : @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 we can see that such model is exactly analogous to having a cosmological constant term @xmath1 plus a time varying cosmic term @xmath58 , with @xmath2 a dimensionless constant . several models with time varying cosmic term are present in the literature . the specific form presented here , with a @xmath59 dependence , are motivated by renormalization group to the vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite discuss exact analytic solutions to this model , with phenomenological @xmath1 and @xmath2 terms . here ,",
    "such terms appear related to the elko spinor mass , coupling constant @xmath54 and the value of the field @xmath37 .    by assuming a matter content that satisfies an equation of state of the form @xmath60",

    "( [ h22 ] ) can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the current matter parameter density .",
    "as we assume spatial flatness , it is related to the relates elko parameter density @xmath66 by @xmath67 the free parameters @xmath68 must respect the physical limits @xmath69 , which corresponds to current baryon density and @xmath70 , as a negative @xmath71 would give rise to formation of ghosts in the lagrangian .",
    "analogously , it corresponds to a prohibition of vacuum creation , as required by thermodynamics .",
