    "in the very early universe , 1 to 300 seconds after the big bang , neutrons and protons coupled into nuclei and the primordial plasma composition was formed : hydrogen , helium-4 , deuterium , lithium-7 and a small admixture of other nuclides .",
    "recently , measurements of the abundances of the primordial elements have drawn considerable attention .",
    "on the one hand , the predictions of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis theory ( bbn ) are becoming more precise .",
    "the only free parameter of bbn , the baryon - to - photon ratio , has been tightly constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with the planck space observatory . the planck results and other recent cosmological data , together with an improved nuclear reaction network , now constrain the primordial helium abundance to within a tenth of a per cent : @xmath11 @xcite . the corresponding predictions for the primordial abundances of deuterium and lithium",
    "are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , direct measurements of the primordial helium abundance have now reached a precision of about 1% .",
    "the standard approach is based on observations of low - metallicity hii regions in dwarf galaxies and extrapolating the measured dependence of the helium abundance on metallicity to extremely low metallicities . using this method",
    ", @xcite achieved a precision of a few per cent : @xmath14 .",
    "another recent determination by @xcite provided an even more precise measurement : @xmath15 .    one may hope that further progress in observational techniques will make it possible to improve the accuracy of direct helium abundance measurements by another order of magnitude or so and thus bring it to the already achieved @xmath10% level of cosmological predictions of the primordial helium abundance , enabling a stringent test of the bbn paradigm .",
    "when dealing with such tight constraints it is crucial to account for any astrophysical phenomena that may have affected the helium abundance during the cosmic history .",
    "one such potentially important effect is considered in the present work .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that long - term ( billions of years ) diffusion in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of clusters of galaxies may cause a noticeable increase of the cluster - averaged helium abundance due to net inflow of helium from the intergalactic medium .",
    "although this result was obtained for a hydrostatic model of the icm immersed in an infinite reservoir of gas ( assuming constant density at the outer boundary ) , a similar phenomenon may be expected to take place in protoclusters and more generally during structure formation in the universe .",
    "so far , there have been very few works on primordial element diffusion .",
    "@xcite studied diffusion of primordial elements in the linear regime of perturbation growth .",
    "@xcite suggested that ambipolar diffusion of ionized lithium during structure formation might explain the discrepancy between the observed lithium abundance ( the so - called spite plateau , @xcite ) and the bbn predictions , provided there are sufficiently strong primordial magnetic fields .    in this work",
    "we examine diffusion - driven separation of the primordial elements during the formation of the first star - forming minihalos and galaxies in the early universe .",
    "we consider two stages of structure formation and evolution : i ) the primary collapse of a halo and ii ) subsequent accretion of matter onto the virialized halo .",
    "in astrophysical setups , diffusion can be caused by concentration , density and temperature gradients in a gas and by gravity .",
    "in many astrophysical problems , diffusion is considered for systems that are in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "typically , it means that the gravitational force is balanced by the opposite force of the gas pressure gradient , which is itself caused by the gravity .",
    "therefore , if thermal diffusion is negligible , it is gravity that drives diffusion in such systems , giving rise to gravitational separation of different ionic species .    in our primary focus here",
    "is diffusion during the formation of the first structures in the universe . in this case",
    ", an assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium would be appropriate only for rare objects with masses near the jeans mass and also at the initial linear stage of growth of a perturbation of any mass .",
    "we do not consider this special case here and address the more common case of structures with masses considerably above the jeans mass so that gas pressure is small compared to gravitational attraction .",
    "essentially , we consider free fall of gas into a gravitational well .",
    "this , however , does not imply that there is no diffision .",
    "in fact , since there are still density and temperature gradients in the gas flows under consideration , atomic species with different masses and hence different thermal velocities experience different ( albeit small ) pressure forces per unit mass , which causes element diffusion .",
    "this type of diffusion is often referred to as barodiffusion ( for a detailed discussion , see  58 in @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of hydrostatic equilibrium , the diffusion here proceeds under `` zero gravity '' , which means that the gravitational force drops from the equations governing diffusion velocities . in this case , the diffusion is slow compared to the bulk motion of the gas .",
    "we consider two stages of structure formation and evolution .",
    "the first stage is the primary collapse of a density perturbation including its linear and nonlinear phases , while the second one is the subsequent accretion of matter onto the virialized object .",
    "we first focus our attention on the early epoch between cosmological recombination and reionization when most of the baryonic matter in the universe was neutral ( section  [ sec : cold_dif ] ) .",
    "next , we study diffusion in moderately heated , weakly ionized gas during the early stages of cosmic reionization ( section  [ sec : pre - heating ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss effects of diffusion in the hot intergalactic gas after reionization of the universe was completed ( section  [ sec : reionization ] ) .    here",
    "are our basic assumptions :    * for both stages , we use a model of an isolated , spherically symmetric perturbation . for the second ( accretion ) stage , we use the self - similar solution of @xcite .",
    "we assume that there is no magnetic field in the medium outside the forming halo ( hereafter the intergalactic medium , igm ) , which might be a reasonable assumption for the early cosmic epochs considered here . *",
    "we adopt a cosmology with parameters inferred from the planck data : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "the latter are defined as the ratio of the number of nuclei of a given element to that of hydrogen .",
    "the baryon gas is modeled as a composition of 6 species : neutral hydrogen , neutral he@xmath23 , protons , singly or doubly ionized he@xmath23 , electrons and some minor species .",
    "the latter is either deuterium or lithium in various ionization states .",
    "importantly , diffusion of the main species , hydrogen and helium , is not affected by the presence of minor species because of the very small abundance of the latter . *",

    "the mean baryon temperature @xmath28 is obtained in the standard way from the balance equation taking into account the coupling of free electrons to the background radiation and the adiabatic expansion @xcite .",

    "gives rise to barodiffusion in the gas flow outside the top - hat perturbation , while in the approximation used here there is no diffusion inside it ( because the density and temperature are constant there ) .",

    "formally , the solution for spherical collapse remains valid up to a later time @xmath71 , when the central density becomes infinite , but in reality perfect collapse is unlikely to happen due to the presence of anisotropies and angular momentum in the initial distribution of matter .",

    "we therefore adopt @xmath226 as the minimal halo mass in our computations , although the jeans mass can be an order of magnitude smaller ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : mj_cold ] below ) .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cold_dif ] shows the relative enhancement in the abundance of helium accumulated over the pre - collapse growth of a perturbation ( stage i in our model ) as a function of @xmath166 .",
    "we start our calculations at @xmath165 , i.e. just after cosmological recombintaion .",
    "the integration is stopped at @xmath227 , the redshift of the earlier of two events : @xmath78 , when the perturbation turns around to collapse , or the end of cosmic reionization @xmath228 , when the universe becomes completely ionized and our approximation of cold and nearly neutral igm becomes invalid .",
    "we see that diffusion - driven helium enrichment diminishes with increasing halo mass and reaches a maximum amplitude @xmath229 for @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "the decreasing trend with mass can be explained as follows .",
    "the instantaneous flux of particles of a given sort ( e.g. helium ) through the boundary @xmath44 of the growing perturbation @xmath232 . due to self - similarity of the solution for spherical collapse , the diffusion velocity @xmath233 ( times some temperature dependence arising from the diffusion coefficient ) . here",
    ", @xmath234 is the current mean matter density in the universe and @xmath235 is the current overdensity within the perturbation , which does not depend on the mass of the overdense region if the initial density contrast @xmath236 is fixed .",
    "the total mass gas ( mainly hydrogen ) within @xmath44 remains constant with time ( @xmath237 ) and is @xmath238 .",
    "therefore , diffusion is expected to change the helium abundance by @xmath239 , since @xmath240 .",
    "the smaller effect for @xmath241 compared to @xmath242 , observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cold_dif ] , is due to the fact that in this case the calculation was halted at @xmath228 when the perturbation was still growing and the pressure gradient was still small , accordingly limiting the diffusion velocity .",
    "also shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cold_dif ] are the corresponding abundance changes for minor species , namely @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 , for @xmath246 , when diffusion is most efficient .",
    "diffusion gradually raises all of these abundances in the forming halo , and the enhancements are comparable to or smaller than that for helium . due to the low ionization potential of @xmath244 ( @xmath247  ev ) , nearly half of primordial lithium is expected to be in the singly - ionized state after cosmic recombination , at @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "the cross - section of @xmath245@xmath204 coulomb interactions is much larger than that for @xmath245@xmath203 collisions .",
    "even at @xmath225 , this leads to spatial coupling of @xmath245 and @xmath204 resulting in a net diffusive outflow of ionized lithium from the forming halo .",
    "however , the yet faster outflow of @xmath203 atoms leads to a slow increase of @xmath245 abundance in the overdense region with time .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cold_dif ] shows the relative enhancements of the abundance of helium , deuterium and lithium accumulated during subsequent accretion of matter onto the newly formed halo ( stage ii ) as a function of final halo mass @xmath249 at @xmath228 ( where @xmath250 at @xmath21 for the self - similar accretion solution and possible changes in the halo mass associated with this period . ] ) . in this case , we start our calculation at the moment of virialization of the initial perturbation , @xmath71 , and stop it at @xmath228 ( assuming that @xmath251 ) .",
    "as was the case with stage i , we see that the diffusion effect decreases with increasing halo mass .",
    "in addition , it increases with @xmath169 , due to the longer time available for operation of diffusion .",
    "helium enrichment reaches a maximum of @xmath252 for @xmath253 when @xmath254 .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : cold_dif ] indicate that , for a given object , diffusion - induced abundance enhancements are typically 23 times larger for the accretion stage than for the pre - collapse stage .",
    "we thus focus our attention on the accretion stage in the subsequent discussion .",
    "we conclude that diffusion could not raise the primordial abundances of helium , deuterium and lithium by more than @xmath255 in the first bound structures formed in the universe before it was reionized and experienced any preheating .",
    "moreover , this effect is restricted to the smallest halos of mass @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "observations indicate that the igm was almost fully reionized by @xmath228 @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that cosmic reionization was mostly driven by uv radiation from the first galaxies .",
    "however , it is likely ( e.g. , @xcite ) that already during the early epoch of structure formation there existed x - ray sources that could significantly preheat and preionize the gas throughout the universe .",
    "this might have been helped by cosmic - ray heating caused by the first supernovae @xcite .",
    "it is thus likely that the igm was warm and weakly ionized long before @xmath256 , and such conditions could be favourable for diffusion .",
    "therefore , we now examine the impact of igm preheating on helium diffusion in halos forming before the reionization of the universe was completed .",
    "we consider a simplistic scenario that at redshift @xmath257 the igm was suddenly preheated to a temperature @xmath258 and its ionization fraction was raised to @xmath27 , and the igm remained in this state until @xmath256 .",
    "as before , we study diffusion using the adiabatic solution for gas accretion onto a virialized halo , whose mass must exceed the jeans mass @xcite : @xmath259 at @xmath260 , the mean baryon temperature decouples from that of the cmb and later on declines as @xmath261 , and the corresponding jeans mass @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the mean molecular weight for neutral ( fully ionized ) gas . if , however , the igm is heated to a specified temperature @xmath264 , then @xmath265    figure  [ fig : tas ] shows the relative enhancement in the abundance of helium accumulated during accretion of a preheated igm onto a virialized halo as a function of @xmath258 .",
    "it is assumed that halos virialize at @xmath266 and accrete matter until @xmath267 .",
    "the stage of initial halo growth and collapse ( before @xmath169 ) is not taken into account . in the left panel ,",
    "we illustrate the impact of heating on neutral and fully ionized gas .",
    "the large coulomb cross - sections between charged particles effectively prevent diffusion in ionized plasma at low temperatures .",
    "however , the spitzer diffusion coefficient steeply rises with temperature , much faster than for neutral gases : @xmath268 vs. @xmath269 . as a result , for igm temperatures above @xmath145 k the effects of diffusion in fully ionized and neutral gases become similar .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tas ] shows results for partially ionized gas .",
    "if neutral particles are a dominant gas component , then neutral - charged interactions have small effect on diffusion of the neutral species , so that the effect of diffusion in weakly ionized gas ( @xmath270% ) is similar to that in neutral gas .",
    "we see that moderate igm preheating can significantly increase the efficiency of diffusion of helium ( and other primordial elements ) during accretion of gas onto newly formed bound objects . for example",
    ", helium enrichment can reach @xmath4 in minihalos of @xmath271 for @xmath272  k and @xmath273 in more massive halos ( @xmath274 ) for @xmath275  k , provided the ionization degree is not too high , @xmath276% .",
    "the former would correspond to objects that probably hosted the first , metal - free stars in the universe , and the latter to the first galaxies in the universe .",
    "we finally consider the case of virialized objects accreting hot ionized gas upon reionization of the universe .",
    "we now assume that at @xmath256 the igm became fully ionized ( @xmath277@xmath278 , depending on whether helium is singly or doubly ionized ) and acquired a constant high temperature @xmath279  k. we further assume that there was a preceeding period @xmath280 of preheating when the igm had lower temperature @xmath258 and ionization fraction @xmath281 .",
    "we calculated effects of diffusion in the post - reionization epoch for a number of such simplistic scenarios of igm reionization :    1 .",
    "@xmath282  k , without preheating ; 2 .",
    "@xmath282  k , @xmath283  k and @xmath284 ; 3 .",

    "@xmath287  k , @xmath285  k and @xmath286 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath288  k , no preceeding stage .",
    "we adopt @xmath289 and @xmath228 .",
    "the scenarios are illustrated in fig  [ fig : scenarios ] .     for scenarios 14 and at @xmath290 for scenario 5 .",
    "in all the scenarios , @xmath228 ; @xmath289 for scenarios 24 ( see text for further details ) . ]    . for scenarios 14 ,",
    "helium is assumed to be in the neutral and singly ionized states in the same proportion as hydrogen ( determined by @xmath27 ) . for scenario 5 ,",
    "we assume that all helium is @xmath210 ( solid black ) , but show for comparison the result for @xmath206 ( black dash - dotted ) . also shown is the result obtained for @xmath210 with thermal diffusion artificially turned off ( grey dashed ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : rei ] shows the results of these computations as a function of final redshift @xmath227 . for scenarios 13 , we start the calculations at the virialization redshift @xmath73 and consider halos with initial mass @xmath291 so that the halo remains above the jeans limit during the post - reionization epoch . for scenario 4 ,",
    "we consider halos with @xmath73 and @xmath292 .",
    "for scenario 5 ( hot igm ) , we take @xmath290 and @xmath293 . in this case",
    ", we consider diffusion in a gas composed of @xmath204 , electrons and either @xmath206 or @xmath210 .",
    "we see that element diffusion during cosmological accretion of gas in the post - reionization epoch can not change the abundance of helium in virialized halos by more than @xmath294 if the accreting gas has a temperature of a few @xmath145  k , as expected for @xmath295 @xcite .",
    "however , a substantially stronger effect may be achieved in the case of accretion of hot plasma with @xmath9  k , with thermal diffusion being important here ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rei ] ) . in this case",
    ", helium enrichment may reach @xmath6 by @xmath7 .",
    "this pertains to objects of high ( final ) mass , @xmath8 , since smaller structures can not accrete hot gas . while our scenario 5 , where the igm temperature is set at @xmath296  k already at @xmath267 , is certainly unrealistic , the change in the abundance of helium results from integration of the diffusion - driven inflow over the period @xmath297 and is largely determined by what happens in its low - redshift part .",
    "since a substantial fraction of the igm at @xmath7 is in fact expected to be in a warm - hot phase with @xmath298@xmath299  k @xcite and this gas should be accreting onto massive halos , a substantial enrichment of galaxies by helium during this epoch via diffusion might indeed be possible ( provided magnetic fields do not change this simple picture completely ) .",
    "this deserves a more detailed assessment in future work .    .",
    "for the top group of curves , the igm temperature @xmath288  k and the halo mass @xmath293 .",
    "for the bottom group of curves , @xmath282 k and @xmath300 .",
    "the short dashed lines are @xmath301 , the long dashed ones are @xmath302 , the dash - dotted ones @xmath303 , dotted curve is @xmath245 . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath206 and @xmath210 are shown by the solid lines . ]",
    "we can finally estimate the abundance changes for deuterium and lithium .",
    "figure  [ fig : minor_sp ] shows results obtained for two reionization temperatures @xmath304  k and @xmath296  k. here , for simplicity we started our calculations at @xmath305 .",
    "we see that , as with helium , the largest abundance increments arise in the case of accretion of hot ( @xmath296  k ) plasma .",
    "the result also depends on the ionization state of a given element , primarily because barodiffusion depends on the mass and ion charge .",
    "we have explored the possible impact of diffusion on the abundance of helium and other primordial elements during formation of the first structures in the early universe .",
    "we considered two stages of structure evolution : growth of a perturbation until its collapse and subsequent accretion of gas onto the virialized halo .    at the end of the dark ages ,",
    "when baryonic matter was cold and nearly neutral , diffusion could raise the concentration of he , d and li relative to hydrogen in the first virialized minihalos : the maximum enrichment for helium is @xmath0 for @xmath1@xmath2 halos .",
    "moderate preheating of the igm by x - ray irradiation or other mechanisms at the beginning of cosmic reionization could significantly accelerate diffusion during secondary accretion of gas onto virialized objects and accordingly change the chemical composition of their gas content .",
    "helium enrichment could reach @xmath4 in minihalos of @xmath271 , capable of forming the first stars , for an igm heated to @xmath272  k , and @xmath273 in @xmath274 halos , presumably hosting the first galaxies , for @xmath275  k ( provided the igm remained moderately ionized , @xmath276% ) .",
    "some of the protogalaxies formed at that time may still exist as dwarf galaxies at the present epoch and might be the best targets to search for the predicted primordial abundance distortions .",
    "it should be noted that the element abundances , including that of helium , observed today in most places of the universe have been affected by stellar evolution .",
    "the effect of the latter is smallest in low - metallicity dwarf galaxies , where helium abundance can be modified by as little as @xmath306 ( whereas for galaxies with solar metallicity , @xmath307 ) @xcite .",
    "this is comparable , but yet somewhat larger than the predicted amplitude of the effect of diffusion .",
    "furthermore , for measurements of primordial helium abundance , the effect of chemical enrichment due to star formation is usually corrected for by extrapolating the regression of the helium abundance versus metallicity ( typically , oxygen abundance ) to zero metallicity @xcite .",
    "we also examined accretion of gas onto virialized objects upon reionization of the universe . in this case",
    ", diffusion can not change the abundance of he , d and li by more than @xmath294 if the igm has a temperature of a few @xmath145  k , as is expected for @xmath295 .",
    "however , a more noticebale helium enrichment , @xmath6 , may be achieved by @xmath7 in the case of accretion of warm - hot igm with @xmath9  k onto massive ( @xmath8 ) halos , corresponding to protogroups of galaxies .",
    "the diffusion - induced abundance changes discussed here are small but comparable to the already achieved @xmath10% precision of cosmological predictions of the primordial he abundance .",
    "if direct helium abundance measurements ( in particular , in low - metallicity hii regions in dwarf galaxies ) achieve the same level of precision in the future ( currently it is worse by an order of magnitude ) , their comparison with the bbn predictions may require consideration of the effects discussed here .",
