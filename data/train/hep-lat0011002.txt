    "in lattice qcd a method for full non  perturbative renormalization of operators by means of monte ",
    "carlo simulations was proposed in @xcite . to extend the range of momenta over which operators are renormalized ,",
    "we combine simulations at different values of coupling constant @xmath1 but with overlapping regions of physical momenta , relating renormalization coefficients between momenta scales from @xmath3 to @xmath4 gev .",
    "the renormalized operator @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 where for an operator with @xmath7 quark fields @xmath8 is defined by the renormalization condition @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a truncated greens function traced with a projector @xmath11 on the tree ",
    "level operator .",
    "it is calculated with far off ",
    "shell external momenta in landau gauge . for quark bilinears , @xmath12 ,",
    "where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is non  amputated greens function .",
    "the quark field renormalization coefficient is defined through the ward identity for the conserved vector current , @xmath15",
    "when scaling violations are small , the renormalization coefficients calculated at two different values of the lattice spacing are related to each other by an overall multiplicative coefficient which is independent of the physical conditions such as physical volume @xmath16 or momentum scale @xmath17 ,    @xmath18    for each operator we perform a series of simulations with lattice spacing @xmath19 increasing by factors of two . the number of lattice sites in all directions is fixed .",
    "the physical volume is finite and different in each simulation , increasing by factors of @xmath20 .",
    "we rescale the @xmath21factors using property ( [ rescaling ] ) so that they are all defined at a single value of @xmath22 . to compute the scaling coefficients @xmath23 , a series of additional simulations is used with half the number of the lattice sites in each direction and twice as large lattice spacings , so that the physical volume and momenta match those in the main series .",
    "we use fits quadratic in @xmath24 to remove the discretization error corrections to ( [ rescaling ] ) that for domain wall fermions are of order @xmath25 , @xmath26 once we know the rescaling coefficients for pairs of lattice spacings , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc .",
    ", we use them to rescale the @xmath21factors obtained at different @xmath1 s , @xmath29 @xmath30 etc .",
    "an important advantage of this method is that the physical volume is explicitly finite in the simulations at intermediate @xmath1 s .",
    "the infinite volume limit can be taken at the largest @xmath1 to match to perturbation theory .",
    "in our simulations we use lattice volumes @xmath31 and @xmath32 at three values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 with the inverse lattice spacing of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 gev respectively @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : zv ] illustrates the procedure of obtaining the rescaling coefficient for the local vector current from two simulations at different @xmath1 s in the same physical volume .",
    "the two sets of symbols on the main graph correspond to @xmath39 for two values of the lattice spacing at @xmath22 and @xmath34 different by a factor of two .",
    "the smaller plot shows a linear extrapolation of the ratio of these @xmath21factors to @xmath40 according to ( [ ratioaop2 ] ) .",
    "when taking the chiral limit of scalar and pseudoscalar densities at energy scales of a few gev in finite volume , one needs to remove non  leading @xmath41 contributions which have a singular behavior as @xmath42 .",
    "these @xmath41 contributions are proportional to the chiral condensate , @xmath43 @xmath44 for very small masses the zero modes make a significant contribution to @xmath45 with a term inversely proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "this term contributes to ( [ 222 ] ) as @xmath47 . after subtracting these terms ,",
    "the scaling procedure is applied with the results shown in figures [ fig : zsall ] and [ fig : zpall ] .",
    "due to the nonlocal character and summation over @xmath53 , these matrix elements can be very expensive to calculate . to reduce the amount of computational time , we used a random source estimator to compute the part of the sum between @xmath54 and @xmath55 and used only one component of @xmath56 for different momenta to calculate @xmath57        @xmath59 is a phenomenologically important parameter relevant to the calculation of @xmath60 mixing , @xmath61 the renormalization of @xmath59 is the same as that of @xmath62 .",
    "using the upper indices for color and the lower for spin , the non  amputated fourier transformed four  point greens function with equal off - shell external momenta can be written as @xmath63 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is a propagator on a single configuration .",
    "the projection operation is defined as @xmath66 with the amputated greens function given by @xmath67 applying our earlier analysis then gives the results shown in figure [ fig : zbkall ] .",
    "we conclude that this combination of recursive scaling and npr offers a promising connection between the perturbative and non  perturbative regimes  a connection that is required if perturbative errors are to be properly controlled .",
    "the results reported here suggest a consistent picture for the scaling of renormalization factors over a momentum range between 2 and 10 gev for the case of quenched domain wall fermions .",
    "more extensive calculations will be required for a complete demonstration of this approach .",
