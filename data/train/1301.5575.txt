    "grbs non thermal spectrum has lead to the suggestion that both the prompt and the afterglow are produced by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "there is reasonable agreement between the predictions @xcite of the synchrotron model and afterglow observations @xcite .",
    "however , the situation concerning the prompt emission is more complicated .    the observations of many bursts whose lower spectral slope is steeper than the",
    " synchrotron line of death \" @xcite pose a serious problem to synchrotron emission .",
    "this has motivated considerations of photospheric thermal emission @xcite , in which thermal energy stored in the bulk is radiated in the prompt phase at the thomson photosphere and the high energy tail is produced by inverse compton . while this model yields a consistent low energy slope it has its own share of problems .",
    "most notably @xcite have recently shown that unless the outflow is moving very slowly no known mechanism can produce the needed soft photons .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear how the high energy gev emission can be produced within an optically thick regime @xcite . on the other hand , observations of some bursts ,",
    "e.g. grb 080916c in which there is a strong upper limit on the thermal component @xcite , or grbs : 100724b , 110721a , 120323a , where a thermal component was possibly detected but with only a small fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the total energy in the thermal component @xcite and other bursts whose spectral slopes is consistent with synchrotron suggest that for some bursts synchrotron might be a viable model .",
    "in fact , in all cases that involve poynting flux outflows that are poynting flux dominated at the emitting region synchrotron is inevitable and possibly dominant @xcite . as such it is worthwhile to explore the conditions needed to generate the observed prompt emission via synchrotron .    to examine the conditions for synchrotron to operate ,",
    "we consider a general model that follows the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we do nt make any specific assumptions concerning the details of the energy dissipation process or the particle acceleration mechanism .",
    "instead we assume that relativistic electrons and magnetic fields are at place within the emitting region , that is moving relativistically towards the observer .",
    "we examine the parameter space in which these electrons emit the observed radiation via synchrotron while satisfying all known limits on the observed prompt emission .",
    "we use a simple `` single - zone '' calculations that do not take into account the blending of radiation from different angles or from different emitting regions ( reflecting matter moving at different lorentz factors ) , but for the purpose of obtaining the rough range of relevant parameters this is sufficient .",
    "we characterize the conditions within the emitting region by six parameters : the co - moving magnetic field strength , @xmath6 , the number of relativistic emitters , @xmath7 , the ratio between the magnetic energy and the internal energy of the electrons , @xmath8 , the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting region , @xmath9 , the minimal electrons lorentz factor in the source frame , @xmath10 and the ratio between the shell crossing time and the angular timescale , @xmath11 .",
    "we then characterize a single , ",
    "typical \" , grb pulse , which is the building block of the grb lightcurve , by three basic quantities : the peak ( sub - mev ) frequency , the peak flux and the duration .",
    "we compare the first two , the observed peak ( sub - mev ) frequency and the peak flux with the predictions of the synchrotron model and we use the observed duration of the pulse to limit the angular time scale @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron solution is incomplete without a determination of the accompanying synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission , which influences the efficiency of the synchrotron emission .",
    "furthermore , the observations of the high energy ssc emission poses additional constraints on the emitting region .",
    "we describe , therefore , a self - consistent synchrotron self - compton solution .",
    "three additional constraints should be taken into account ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "first , energy considerations pose a strong lower limit on the efficiency .",
    "the energy of the observed sub - mev flux , is huge and already highly constraining astrophysical models .",
    "thus , to avoid an `` energy crisis '' , the emission process must be efficient and emit a significant fraction of the available energy in the sub - mev band .",
    "second , the emission region can not be optically thick . additionally , the lat band ( 100 mev- 300 gev ) gev component is significantly weaker in most grbs than the sub - mev peak @xcite .",
    "we combine these three conditions and constrain the possible phase space in which synchrotron can produce the prompt emission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe in  [ basic ] the basic concepts of the model , discussing the observations in  [ obs ] and the structure of the emitting region and the parameter phase space in  [ emitreg ] . in ",
    "[ detmet ] we describe the synchrotron equations (  [ syneq ] ) , their solutions (  [ synchsol ] ) , the constraints from the accompanying ssc (  [ sec : ssc ] ) , the implications of the results (  [ sec : result ] ) and energy and efficiency constraints (  [ energy_efficiency ] ) .",
    "we continue with a discussion of specific issues concerning the ( i ) expected spectral slopes and possibilities to alleviate the issue of the `` synchrotron line of death '' (  [ specshape ] ) and ( ii ) the narrow @xmath12 distribution (  [ epeak ] ) . in ",
    "[ intshocks ] , we deviate from the general philosophy of the paper and we discuss synchrotron emission within the context of the popular internal shocks framework .",
    "we turn , in  [ sec : paircreation ] , to the implications of the pair creation limits from observed gev emission for the synchrotron model . in  [ sec : cta ] we briefly discuss the possibilities of detecting grbs with cta , and their implications on the model at hand .",
    "limits on the optical @xcite , x - ray @xcite , gev @xcite and tev @xcite emission during the prompt phase of grbs , demonstrate that the observed sub - mev peak carries most of the grb s energy .",
    "the only ( unlikely ) possibilities that have not been ruled out are either an extremely strong and sharp peak between 10 - 100ev or a peak at extremely high energies above the tev range .",
    "therefore , we associated the sub - mev peak with the peak of the synchrotron emission .",
    "we consider the typical observations after redshift corrections , i.e. in the host galaxy frame which we denote as `` the source frame '' ( as opposed to `` the observer frame '' ) .",
    "the basic observables are : the peak frequency : @xmath13 ( 300kev ) , the duration of a typical pulse , @xmath14 ( 0.5 sec ) and the peak flux , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . with these definitions we remove the @xmath17 dependence from the equations , and",
    "the only remaining dependence on redshift is through the luminosity distance , relating the flux and luminosity .",
    "all three quantities vary from pulse to pulse and the values in brackets denote the canonical values that we use here .",
    "these three observations together with a typical luminosity distance , @xmath18 cm ( or @xmath19 ) correspond to an isotropic equivalent luminosity of @xmath20erg / sec .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath12 and @xmath21 satisfy : @xmath22erg / sec @xcite , we therefore choose @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that they are compatible with this relation . in  [ epeak ] we explore the dependence of the synchrotron model on this choice and look at 4 representative `` grb types '' . an additional observation that we use",
    "is the limit on the total flux observed in the lat band ( 30 mev-300 gev ) , which is at most 0.13 of the gbm ( 8kev-40mev ) flux @xcite .",
    "the general model requires a relativistic jet , traveling with a lorentz factor @xmath9 with respect to the host galaxy with a half opening angle of @xmath25 , at a distance @xmath26 from the origin of the explosion and with a kinetic energy @xmath27 in the source frame .",
    "the source can be treated as spherically symmetric as long as @xmath28 which is expected to hold during the prompt phase , in which @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we therefore do not solve for @xmath25 and use isotropic equivalent quantities throughout the paper .",
    "an upper limit on the emitting radius is given by the variability time scale , @xmath30 .",
    "we define a dimensionless parameter @xmath11 such that @xmath31 is the shell s width : @xmath32 with this definition , the pulse duration is : @xmath33 clearly , for @xmath34 the pulse width is determined by angular spreading .",
    "we consider a single - zone model in which the different properties of the emitting region are constant throughout the zone .",
    "notice that the single - zone approach can not test spectral evolution , and becomes less accurate as @xmath11 increases .",
    "initially , the emitting region consists of either an electron - proton or an electron - positron plasma .",
    "the numbers of protons and positrons are denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . due to electrical neutrality ,",
    "the number of electrons is @xmath37 .",
    "after the gamma - rays are produced , annihilating high energy photons may result in extra electrons and positrons .",
    "we denote the number of pairs created in this way by @xmath38 ( typically these particles are less energetic than the original population of emitting particles ) .",
    "altogether , there are @xmath39 electrons and positrons in the flow .",
    "the number of electrons is always larger than the number of positrons except for the case of an initial pair dominated outflow , where they are equal .",
    "therefore , to simplify the presentation , we use hereafter `` electrons '' instead of the more accurate but cumbersome `` electrons and positrons '' . in the fast cooling regime ,",
    "the typical synchrotron cooling time of a relativistic electron is shorter than the pulse duration and thus the instantaneously emitting particles are much less than the total number of emitting particles during one pulse ( see fig.[fig : singlezone ] ) .",
    "the emitting electrons are characterized by @xmath40 which is defined to be the ratio between the number of instantaneously emitting electrons and the overall number of relativistic electrons emitting during the entire pulse ( a concise definition of all these particle numbers is given in table [ tbl : numbers ] ) .",
    "[ h ]    .different particle numbers used in the text . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl : numbers ]    the relativistic electrons have a power - law distribution of energies : @xmath41 ( where c is a normalization constant ) which holds for @xmath42 .",
    "based on theory , we expect @xmath43 to be of the order @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "indeed this result has been confirmed observationally both from the grb prompt and afterglow phases @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 arises , most likely , due to synchrotron losses at the energy where the acceleration time equals to the energy loss time @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a numerical constant of order unity which encompasses the details of the acceleration process and @xmath6 is measured in gauss . in a shock - acceleration scenario this depends on the amount of time the particle spends in the downstream and upstream regions @xcite .",
    "the total internal energy of the electrons is then ( primes denote the co - moving frame ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the energy of the flow dissipated into internal energy and the ratio of the total energy in these relativistic electrons to the total internal energy is denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "notice that @xmath50 does not necessarily reflect the ratio of instantaneous energy of the relativistic electrons to the total energy , which could be much smaller .    the magnetic field , @xmath6 , is assumed to be constant over the entire emitting region .",
    "its energy is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the thickness of the shell in the co - moving frame and @xmath53 is the fraction of magnetic to internal energy . in this case , for a baryoninc dominated flow , @xmath54 .",
    "whereas , in a poyinting flux dominated jet , one can imagine a situation in which at first the energy is stored within the magnetic fields , and only later it is dissipated and transferred to the electrons . within the definitions we use here , this means that @xmath55 .",
    "overall , we find that six independent parameters define the synchrotron solution these are : the co - moving magnetic field strength , @xmath6 , the number of relativistic electrons , @xmath7 , the ratio between the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of the electrons , @xmath8 , the bulk lorentz factor of the jet with respect to the grb host galaxy , @xmath9 , the minimum electrons lorentz factor in the source frame , @xmath10 , and the ratio between the shell crossing time and the angular timescale , @xmath11",
    ". the first three observables : the spectral peak , the peak luminosity and the pulse duration , described in ",
    "[ obs ] , reduce the number of free parameters from six to three , which we choose as : ( @xmath56 ) . the other constraints limit the allowed regions within this parameter space .",
    "the typical synchrotron frequency and power produced by an electron with a lorentz factor @xmath57 are : @xcite @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath9 is the lorentz factor of the bulk and @xmath60 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "when the electrons have a power - law distribution of energies above some @xmath10 there are two typical breaks in the spectrum .",
    "the first is the synchrotron frequency of a typical electron , @xmath61 .",
    "the second is the cooling frequency , the frequency at which electrons cooling on the pulse time - scale , radiate : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the relative energy loss by ic as compared with synchrotron for @xmath64 .",
    "the peak of the synchrotron @xmath65 is at @xmath66 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we identify this peak with the observed sub - mev peak . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the `` typical '' electrons are fast cooling and rapidly dispose of all their kinetic energy , while for @xmath68 the electrons are slow cooling and the typical electrons do not emit all their energy which is eventually lost by adiabatic cooling .",
    "we consider fast cooling solutions ( or marginally fast ) for the prompt emission .",
    "the maximal spectral flux , at @xmath69 $ ] is given by combining eqns .",
    "[ synch1 ] , [ sync2 ] : @xmath70 for @xmath67 , this is the flux at @xmath71 and the peak of @xmath72 .",
    "however , in the fast cooling regime the flux between @xmath71 and @xmath73 varies as @xmath74 and the peak of @xmath75 is at @xmath73 : @xmath76 where the factor @xmath77 accounts for the fact that only @xmath78 of the relativistic electrons are instantaneously emitting and only @xmath79 of their energy loss is by synchrotron ( the rest is by the accompanying ssc ) . in the fast cooling regime ,",
    "the electrons cool on a shorter timescale than the pulse duration and several consecutive cooling processes may be needed to account for the comparatively long pulse duration .",
    ". [ synch3 ] can be understood in terms of the cooling time of the electrons , @xmath80 , the time it takes the electrons to radiate ( by synchrotron and ic ) their kinetic energy : @xmath81 @xmath82 is declining as a function of @xmath57 . therefore it is maximal for @xmath10 , and after a time @xmath83 all of the electrons have cooled significantly . combining eqs .",
    "[ synch1 ] , [ coolfreq ] and [ cooltime ] gives : @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that : @xmath85 , which tells us that indeed only the instantaneously synchrotron emitting electrons contribute to the peak of @xmath65 .",
    "given the spectrum , the source must be optically thin for scatterings : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the total number of electrons and positrons in the flow .",
    "@xmath88 is composed of two components .",
    "the first , @xmath7 , is calculated from the peak flux .",
    "notice that in principle there could be additional non - relativistic electrons in the initial flow that although they do nt contribute to the radiation , they can be important due to their effect on the optical depth .",
    "we return to this point in  [ synchsol ] .",
    "the second , @xmath89 , is the electron - positron pairs created by annihilation of the high energy photons .",
    "@xmath38 is derived by considering the optical depth for pair creation ( @xcite ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of photons in the source with enough energy to annihilate the photon with frequency , @xmath92 .",
    "the frequency @xmath93 , is defined as the ( source frame ) photon frequency at which @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 equals the number of photons above @xmath93 .",
    "a more detailed calculation of the pair creation opacity has to take care of the details of the radiation field in the source @xcite .",
    "there could in principle be a numerical factor in eq .",
    "[ taugg ] of order @xmath95 @xcite this in turn , would lower the minimum requirement on @xmath9 . however : @xmath96 , which means that the change in the lower limit of @xmath9 in the exact calculation , will only be of order 0.5 - 0.7 .",
    "we solve the synchrotron eqns .",
    "described in  [ syneq ] and reduce the 6d parameter space described in  [ emitreg ] to a 3d parameter space defined by ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "we then consider three constraints that limit the allowed regions within this parameter space . in ",
    "[ sec : paircreation ] we discus further constraints on this parameter space that arise from pair creation opacity limits .    solving eqns .",
    "[ t_p ] , [ energymag ] , [ synch1 ] , [ coolfreq ] and [ synch3 ] we find : @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105kev , @xmath106 , @xmath107sec and @xmath108 cm .",
    "we proceed to consider the limits on the parameter space ( @xmath97 ) that arise from ( i ) efficiency ( fast cooling ) , ( ii ) the size of the emitting radius and ( iii ) the opacity .",
    "efficiency and fast cooling require @xmath109 (  [ syneq ] ) , which yields : @xmath110    the emitting radius must be smaller than @xmath111 , the deceleration radius @xcite .",
    "the latter depends on the circum - burst density profile : a wind with @xmath112 or a constant ism with @xmath113 .",
    "the limit on the emitting region can be written , in these two cases , as : @xmath114 where @xmath115erg is the total ( isotropic ) energy of the burst ( and not just the energy emitted in one pulse ) , @xmath116sec is the total duration of the burst , @xmath117 is the particle density in @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the flow is optically thin for scattering .",
    "typically , we find that @xmath88 is dominated by the pairs created within the flow by the annihilation of the high energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the main contribution to the number of photons available for pair creation is from ic scatterings of synchrotron photons to energies above the pair creation threshold . solving eqns .",
    "[ tau1 ] , [ taugg ] and [ gamma ] we obtain : @xmath120 the criterion @xmath121 leads to a lower limit on @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that in many models one may expect a large amount of passive ( i.e. non relativistic ) electrons in the flow @xcite . in this case",
    "the optical depth may become dominated by these electrons .",
    "we discuss this option in  [ intshocks ] .",
    "so far we discussed only the synchrotron signal itself , and we havent yet addressed the ssc contribution .",
    "we now turn to describe the ssc emission , and explore its effect on the solutions .",
    "synchrotron is essentially accompanied by ssc .",
    "we describe here a single - zone analytic solution of this component which is expected to reproduce the general characteristics of the true solution . however , we note that a full description of the up - scattered flux can only be done with more detailed calculations @xcite and those might differ somewhat from the simplified analysis . if a ssc signal is detected , we can measure both the peak frequency and the flux of the ssc component . in this case , we obtain two additional equations that allow us to determine the parameters up to a single free parameter which we choose as @xmath11",
    ". this may be the situation in the future , when cta begins observing in the very high energy range .",
    "we return to this intriguing possibility in  [ sec : cta ] .",
    "but even if the ssc signal is not detected ( as is the current observational situation ) we can use the non - detection as a limit on the parameter space . note that the signal could be undetected either because it is very weak or because it peaks at sufficiently high frequencies and can not be observed by current detectors .",
    "the typical ssc photon frequency is given by : @xmath122 the ic process is suppressed by the klein - nishina effect and the photons are up - scattered only to @xmath123 , if the up - scattered photon s energy in the electron s rest frame exceeds the electron rest mass energy : @xmath124 this condition is satisfied if : @xmath125 thus , for typical parameters the up - scattered photons are most likely in the kn regime .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath126 @xcite to take the kn effect into account : @xmath127    the total ssc flux ( integrated over frequencies ) , @xmath128 , is related to the total flux ascosiated with the synchrotron peak , @xmath129 , by : @xmath130 where : @xmath131 is the compton parameter @xcite .",
    "this yields : @xmath132    as mentioned above , a possible future detection of an ssc component above the lat range can , in principle , measure : @xmath123 and @xmath128 .",
    "this provides two extra equations , allowing us to solve for @xmath9 and @xmath133 . using eqns .",
    "[ knratio ] [ ycases ] we can write : @xmath134 and @xmath135    in addition , detection of a ssc signal above tens of gev , implies that the spectral breaks observed by the lat are not due to an optical depth . if the particles are shock accelerated then these breaks would be associated with the maximal synchrotron frequency : @xmath136hz@xcite where @xmath47 depends on the acceleration mechanism , and is expected to be of order unity @xcite .",
    "if we can also observe @xmath137 we obtain another equation that would allow us to solve for @xmath11 and either obtain the full solution or rule it out if no solution is found : @xmath138 @xmath139    @xmath140    as opposed to similar observations in blazars , current observations in the gev range do not detect a significant high energy component in typical grbs .",
    "current detections of a gev component are at the level of 0.03 of the mev emission and upper limits for most other bursts are at the level of 0.1 . in a few cases ( e.g. grb 090926a",
    "@xcite ) an additional high energy component has been detected , and may be associated with ssc , however , even in this case one does not see a clear gev peak , like the one observed in blazars . in this case , the upper limits on the ssc signal further constrain the possible parameter space .",
    "first , the photon with largest observed frequency , @xmath141 must satisfy : @xmath142 , where the latter is the frequency at which the flow becomes optically thick to pair creation . above @xmath141 , the photons could ( but do not have to ) be optically thick for pair creation . the condition @xmath143 leads to lower limits on @xmath9 .",
    "however , this condition is somewhat model dependent @xcite , and the limits on @xmath9 from this consideration may be alleviated in case of a two zone model .",
    "we therefore separate the discussion of this limit from the main analysis , and return to it later on in  [ sec : paircreation ] .",
    "second , @xcite have shown that for a typical gbm burst the total flux which is observed in the lat band ( 30 mev-300 gev ) is at most 0.13 of the gbm ( 8kev-40mev ) flux of the same burst ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recent studies , using extra noise cuts applied by the lat team @xcite give more constraining upper limits which are lower by a factor @xmath144 .",
    "we define @xmath145 as the upper limit on the fractional lat flux : @xmath146 ( where @xmath147 ) .",
    "below @xmath141 , the photons are necessarily optically thin for pair creation and therefore in order for the lat signal to be sufficiently low , either the total up - scattered flux is low ( less than @xmath145 of the gbm flux ) , or most of the up - scattered flux is at @xmath148 and only a small fraction can be observed ( for an illustration of these possibilities see fig .",
    "[ fig : gevopt ] ) .",

    "we require that the ssc contribution will be sufficiently low to agree with the lat observations .",
    "we separate the possible solutions to two cases .    if @xmath159 , then , @xmath160 and the total up - scattered flux ( and not just the fraction within the considered band ) is below the observed limit .",
    "otherwise , the total ratio of up - scattered to synchrotron flux is larger than @xmath161 , but it peaks at @xmath162 and thus may be partially absorbed . as @xmath9 increases , the up - scattered flux peaks at higher frequencies .",
    "this means , that for large enough values of @xmath9 , the up - scattered tail below @xmath141 is small enough that it is compatible with the observations .",
    "therefore , in this regime of @xmath133 , one can obtain a lower limit on @xmath9 in terms of @xmath145 arising from the requirement that the total up - scattered flux up to @xmath163 be less than the flux observed by lat : @xmath164 notice that these are conservative limits as we only use the spectral range below @xmath141 where we know the conditions are optically thin .",

    "we return to this extreme case in greater detail in  [ sec : paircreation ] .",
    "several characteristic features can be seen in these figures .",
    "first , @xmath26 is directly related to the pulse duration and bulk lorentz factor via eq .",
    "[ t_p ] , and it is independent of @xmath133 . for the canonical observed parameters we use here , @xmath26 spans two orders of magnitude , @xmath170 , and it is relatively large .",
    "@xmath6 is the most fluctuating parameter spanning almost 4 orders of magnitude : @xmath171 .",
    "the lines of constant @xmath6 are almost parallel to the @xmath172 line , which means that the value of @xmath6 is almost a direct representative of @xmath78 , the fraction of instantaneously emitting electrons relative to the total number of electrons .",
    "the allowed range for @xmath10 is : @xmath173 .",
    "these high values of @xmath10 ( compared with @xmath174 ) are extremely significant for grb models in which the electrons are heated by shocks and the initial energy resides in protons . in these cases , it is necessary that only a small fraction of electrons will be heated to relativistic velocities in order to allow them to reach such high energies @xcite .",
    "we show this explicitly for the internal shocks model in  [ intshocks ] .",
    "in addition , we observe that @xmath123 is expected to lie in the range : @xmath175 therefore , even with no knowledge of the lat observations , we could have expected that the ssc does not peak in the gev but typically at least two orders of magnitude above .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the large values of @xmath10 required for this solution .",
    "@xmath7 , is expected to lie between : @xmath176 .    even for the highest observed photon energy of 71 gev ,",
    "we see that the lower limits on @xmath177 that arise from the ssc flux in the gev are less constraining than the lower limits that arise from the optical depth .",

    "current observations of high energy ( gev ) photons lead to pair opacity constraints and to a larger lower limit on @xmath177 . however , this limit depends on the fact that the high frequency photons originate at the same site as the sub - mev photons ( or at smaller radii ) and it maybe relaxed if this is not the case .",
    "the observations of high energy photons actually only produces lower limits on the true frequency at which the system becomes optically thick for pair creation ( @xmath314 ) .",
    "we find that if , in reality , this frequency is as high as 300gev , then low @xmath149 bursts push the model further towards equipartition ( @xmath328 for @xmath34 or @xmath329 for @xmath166 ) .",
    "we explore the implications on the synchrotron model of future high energy observations by the cta , in the tens of gev to tens of tev energy range .",
    "we find three general possibilities .",
    "most trivially , a null detection by cta does not yield significant constraints on the model .",
    "second , a weak detection would imply that @xmath314 is at least of the order of tens of gev , and that there is a weak ssc signal up to this frequency .",
    "this increases the lower limits on @xmath9 and @xmath133 . depending on the actual flux measured",
    ", these limits can be as strong as @xmath320 and @xmath321 .",
    "third , a strong signal in the cta band ( above the extrapolation of the lat signal ) would be suggestive of an ssc peak .",
    "this could allow us to determine at least two of the three free parameters of our model ( @xmath177 , @xmath133 , @xmath11 ) and effectively determine the full solution or possibly rule out the synchrotron model in case either of the first two parameters turns out to be beyond the limits discussed in this paper .",
    "even though we do nt have a full solution we can obtain a reasonable estimate of the expected range of synchrotron parameters needed to produce the observed prompt emission .",
    "the emission radius , @xmath26 , is relatively large : @xmath330 and it is independent of @xmath133 .",
    "the magnetic field , @xmath6 , spans almost four orders of magnitude : @xmath331 .",
    "the lines of constant @xmath6 are almost parallel to the @xmath172 line .",
    "larger values of b lead to faster cooling so that the value of @xmath6 is almost proportional to @xmath78 , the ratio between the number of instantaneously emitting relativistic electrons and the overall number of relativistic electrons .",
    "the allowed range for @xmath10 is : @xmath284 .",
    "these large values of @xmath10 ( compared with @xmath174 ) imply that , in many cases , as we discuss below , only a small fraction of the electrons ( @xmath332 ) are accelerated to relativistic velocities and participate in the synchrotron emission process .",
    "these large values of @xmath10 also suggest that any ssc peak would be at energies of at least a few hundred gev .",
    "this is above the lat band , naturally causing the ssc signal to be hard to observe with current detectors .",
    "interestingly these parameter ranges , are very weakly dependent on @xmath11 and they remain within this range as long as we keep the observed quantities at their canonical values .    slightly deviating from the generic approach we present here , we examined the implications of the model if most of the energy is stored at some stage in the form of kinetic bulk motion .",
    "this would be naturally the case in the internal shocks model but also if the jet is initially poynting flux dominated but it converts it energy to kinetic energy before the energy is radiated away . in this case the synchrotron solution requires that only a small fraction of the electrons in the flow are heated by the shocks and dissipate their energy during the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the distribution of electrons needed for this type of solution is different than what was achieved by recent pic simulations , as it requires a gap between the energy of the non - accelerated electrons , and the minimal energy of the power - law component ( see [ fig : numbers ] ) .",
    "we find that the fraction of accelerated electrons , @xmath280 must satisfy @xmath333 for a proton dominated flow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : number_r ] ) and @xmath334 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : number_r2 ] ) for a pair dominated flow .",
    "the main caveat of this model , that we did not address here , remains the  line of death ",
    "problem , regarding the low energy spectral slope ( see also @xcite ) . a partial solution to this problem can be achieved if the system emits in a marginally fast cooling regime , where @xmath335 .",
    "the high @xmath9 values required by opacity considerations , push the model towards this regime .",
    "however , even the marginally fast solution , only steepens @xmath149 up to @xmath336 and it does not solve the entire problem . a different option is to have a steepening of the slope due to high self absorption frequency @xcite .",
    "this is not easily achieved , as the self absorption frequency is typically four orders of magnitude below the peak .",
    "overall we conclude that there is reasonable range in the parameter ( @xmath9 and @xmath133 ) phase space for which a synchrotron solution that fits the peak frequency and the peak flux is possible .",
    "the main characteristics of this solution are large emission radii , relatively high magnetization and large values of electrons lorentz factors .",
    "these lorentz factors naturally explain the lack of a ssc signal within the lat band .",
    "in addition , the solution naturally explains the lack of soft - high luminosity bursts .",
    "possible future detections of a ssc signal at higher frequencies , will allow to either obtain the full solution of the model , or rule it out altogether .",
