    "it is generally thought that quantum theory and general relativity , when combined , imply the existence of a minimum length in nature , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one line of argument is to consider that when attempting to resolve distances with a smaller and smaller uncertainty @xmath0 , the thereby necessarily increasing momentum uncertainty will induce a correspondingly increasing curvature uncertainty .",
    "eventually the growing curvature uncertainty should make it impossible to resolve distances any further , leading to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is at the planck scale , or perhaps the string scale .",
    "another line of argument comes from black hole physics .",
    "black holes ( and more general causal horizons @xcite ) are believed to carry a finite entropy given by the bekenstein - hawking formula , @xmath3 ( we set @xmath4 ) .",
    "this entropy may have its origin in the entanglement entropy of quantum fields @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) : the entanglement entropy has the same scaling behavior as @xmath5 and the dependence on the number of particle species could also be matched when taking into account how the renormalized gravitational coupling depends on the number of species @xcite .",
    "crucially , the entanglement entropy also matches the order of magnitude of @xmath5 , if there exists a natural ultraviolet cutoff which is close to the planck length , @xmath6 .    given these and other arguments , ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , for the existence of a natural ultraviolet cutoff at the planck length",
    ", the question arises as to the nature of this ultraviolet cutoff . in which sense",
    "might the density of degrees of freedom in quantum fields be finite ? how are these degrees of freedom distributed and how can they be spatially resolved ?    to completely answer these questions would require knowledge of the still - to - be - developed theory of quantum gravity .",
    "more feasible at the present stage is to study how the natural ultraviolet cutoff may first manifest itself as one approaches the planck scale from low energies , i.e. , when coming from the safe ground of low energy physics where conventional quantum field theory ( qft ) still holds .",
    "the question then is how can one model the first modifications to quantum field theory that express the impact of a planck length cutoff ?",
    "one simple model is that of qft on discretized space or spacetime .",
    "a difficulty with this approach is the associated complete breaking of local poincar symmetry , though there are interesting methods to generate discretizations whose statistics are poincar invariant @xcite .",
    "also , when lattices evolve in time , there tend to be problems with non - adiabaticity and an associated excessive particle production from the vacuum , in particular , in an expanding universe @xcite .    here , we will consider a different model for a natural ultraviolet cutoff in qft with which at least the local euclidean symmetries are preserved and which does not necessarily induce non - adiabaticities in an expanding universe .",
    "the model is that of qft with a hard cutoff in the form of a finite spatial bandwidth , i.e , a finite smallest wavelength @xcite .",
    "how does this compare to the models of qft on a lattice ?",
    "it is well - known that the discretization of space gives rise to a minimum wavelength .",
    "it is less well - known that , vice versa , to impose a lower bound on wavelengths does not automatically lead to a discretization of space .",
    "instead , one can also obtain a so - called sampling theoretic cutoff which does not break symmetries such as translation invariance . with this cutoff",
    ", the theory does not live on a single dedicated lattice .",
    "instead , it lives on continuous space and , entirely equivalently , it can be written as living on any one lattice whose average spacing is sufficiently small .    the mathematical structure that underlies the sampling theoretic ultraviolet cutoff is shannon sampling theory .",
    "shannon sampling plays a central rle in information theory because it establishes the equivalence of continuous and discrete representations of information @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , a music signal , @xmath7 , that is low - pass filtered to some finite bandwidth , @xmath8 .",
    "even though the bandlimited music signal is a continuous function in time , it suffices to know the signal s amplitudes @xmath9 on any single lattice of points @xmath10 , if the lattice has an average spacing at or below the critical spacing @xmath11 , which is called the nyquist spacing . from the amplitude samples @xmath12 , the signal @xmath7",
    "can then be reconstructed for all @xmath13 , in principle , without error .",
    "this establishes the equivalence of continuous and discrete representations of information .",
    "the fact that none of the set of sufficiently densely - spaced lattices is preferred allows the preservation of full translation invariance ( and in higher dimensions also rotation invariance ) .    applied to physics ,",
    "this means that spacetime could be simultaneously continuous _ and discrete in mathematically the same way that information ( such as a music signal ) possesses simultaneously both a continuous representation and equivalent discrete representations .",
    "physical fields then possess a representation on continuous space , while being fully equivalently represented also by their amplitudes on any one lattice of sufficiently dense spacing .",
    "the democracy among these lattices allows translation and rotation invariance and more generally also killing vector fields to be preserved with the cutoff . _",
    "our aim here is to study the implications of this sampling theoretic ultraviolet cutoff for localization and entanglement in quantum field theory .",
    "we find that the sampling - theoretic ultraviolet cutoff implies a particular kind of nonlocality in qft which manifests itself through small but non - vanishing equal - time commutators at spacelike separation .",
    "this type of nonlocality appears naturally in perturbative quantum gravity @xcite and in string field theory @xcite .",
    "we also show how correlation functions are affected by the bandlimit , both classically at finite temperature , and quantum - mechanically .",
    "further , in order to probe the spatial localization of degrees of freedom with this uv cutoff , we examine the behaviour of the entanglement entropy in a quantum field . for comparison , recall that in a qft regulated on a lattice , the local field oscillators are coupled via the discretized spatial laplace operator in the lagrangian .",
    "this makes their joint ground state , i.e. , the vacuum state , an entangled state .",
    "tracing over a region therefore yields an entanglement entropy . due to the generally short range of the vacuum entanglement ,",
    "the contributions to the entanglement entropy are dominated by correlations between those local field oscillators that are close the boundary of the considered region .",
    "this usually leads to an area law for the entanglement entropy , see e.g. , @xcite . in the 1 + 1 dimensional massless field theory that we will consider ,",
    "the correlation length is infinite and the entanglement entropy therefore grows logarithmically ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unlike in such lattice theories , a bandlimited qft does not have a preferred lattice representation .",
    "this makes the splitting of space into distinct regions nontrivial and , as a consequence , the hilbert space does not automatically factorize into subsystems .",
    "instead , more subtly , any discrete subset of points in space now defines a subsystem , and one can calculate its entanglement entropy with the rest of the system . in particular , we show how to calculate the entanglement entropy for a subset of degrees of freedom in a gaussian state .",
    "our result generalizes known formulae for the entropy of gaussian states to the setting where the commutation relations are nontrivial .    with samples placed at the nyquist spacing , @xmath11",
    ", we recover the usual logarithmic scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy . when the spacing is larger than the nyquist spacing ( undersampling ) , we find that the entanglement entropy crosses over to a volume law .",
    "further , unlike in a lattice theory , in the bandlimited theory it is possible to probe the entanglement between degrees of freedom that are arbitrarily closely spaced .",
    "surprisingly , when the spacing of samples is smaller than the nyquist spacing ( oversampling ) , we find no reduction in entanglement entropy .",
    "since the sampling points can occupy an arbitrarily small region , this , naively , appears to indicate that the field still carries an infinite density of local degrees of freedom ( local field oscillators ) .",
    "we show that the resolution of this apparent paradox is that the region of space being probed by the sample points does not actually decrease as the samples are taken closer together . in effect , each local field degree of freedom occupies an incompressible volume .",
    "finally , we briefly examine the infrared behaviour of the entanglement entropy in the 1 + 1 dimensional bandlimited theory .",
    "in addition to the well - known logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy , there is a subleading double logarithmic infrared divergence .",
    "this divergence appears whenever there is a continuum of modes above the infrared cutoff scale ; thus it appears when regulating the infrared with a mass or a hard momentum cutoff , but not if regulating by imposing periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of implications and directions for future work .",
    "the central result of classical sampling theory is shannon s sampling theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem establishes an equivalence between discrete and continuous representations of information and it is , therefore , in ubiquitous use in communication engineering and signal processing . let us consider a _ bandlimited _ signal , @xmath14 , i.e. , a signal whose fourier transform is supported on an interval @xmath15 , whose width is the _ bandwidth _ @xmath16 : @xmath17 shannon s theorem states that such a function is completely determined by its values @xmath18 on a discrete lattice of points @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . here",
    ", @xmath22 is an arbitrary fixed constant that labels lattices .",
    "given the values , @xmath23 , of the function on this lattice , @xmath14 can be recovered for any @xmath24 by the reconstruction formula : @xmath25~ \\phi(x_n^{(\\alpha)})\\ ] ] thus , the space of bandlimited functions is completely equivalent to the space of functions defined on this lattice .",
    "this has the practical implication of allowing us to work with concrete and therefore computationally - convenient representations of functions on a lattice ( as well as quantum fields , as we will see below ) while preserving translation invariance ( because the function retains its equivalent continuous representation ) .",
    "another important finding in sampling theory is that the samples of the function do not have to be taken equidistantly : a bandlimited function can be reconstructed on any discrete set of points as long as these points are chosen with a sufficiently dense average spacing ( technically , the beurling average spacing @xcite ) . here , this maximum average spacing is @xmath11 . in general",
    ", such a set of points is called a _ sampling lattice _ , and the case of equidistant samples with separation @xmath11 is called a _ nyquist lattice_. in the case of sampling on a lattice other than a nyquist lattice , perfect reconstruction is still possible but the reconstruction formula is more complicated than and the reconstruction becomes more sensitive to noise in the samples . because the degrees of freedom of the function ( values at the sample points ) are not confined to any particular sampling lattice , the information contained in bandlimited signal is subtly nonlocal .",
    "sampling theory generalizes readily to bandlimited functions in higher dimensions , whose fourier transforms are supported in a compact region of momentum space , see @xcite and it generalizes also to curved space @xcite .",
    "now we will briefly outline some of the functional analytic properties of the space of bandlimited functions .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  [ app : fa_sampling ] for more details regarding the functional analytic structure of sampling theory .",
    "the sampling theorem for a nyquist lattice @xmath26 implies that the collection of @xmath27 functions centred at the lattice points forms a basis for the space of bandlimited functions .",
    "moreover , the coefficients of a function in this basis are simply the values of the function at the corresponding lattice points .",
    "this basis is orthonormal in the inner product @xmath28 the orthogonality follows from the identity @xmath29 \\operatorname{sinc } [ ( x - x_m^{(\\alpha ) } ) \\omega ] = \\delta_{nm}.\\ ] ] different values of @xmath30 corresponds to translated versions of the lattice .",
    "the @xmath27 functions centred at lattice points with a different value of @xmath30 also form an orthogonal basis . crucially , however , @xmath27 functions from different lattices are not orthogonal : @xmath31 \\operatorname{sinc } [ ( x - x_m^{(\\alpha ' ) } ) \\omega ] \\\\ & = \\operatorname{sinc } [ ( x_n^{(\\alpha ) } - x_m^{(\\alpha ' ) } ) \\omega ] \\\\ & = \\operatorname{sinc } [ \\pi ( n - m ) + ( \\alpha - \\alpha')/2 ] \\\\ & \\neq \\delta_{nm } , \\hspace{3 mm } \\mbox{for } \\hspace{1 mm } \\alpha \\neq \\alpha ' \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 .",
    "this fact will be important when we study the localization of field degrees of freedom .",
    "let us denote the vector in the function space corresponding to @xmath33 $ ] by @xmath34 . for fixed @xmath30 , we then obtain a resolution of the identity : @xmath35",
    "taking the union of these bases over @xmath30 , we get an overcomplete basis for the function space with the corresponding @xmath36 s covering @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we can write down an overcomplete resolution of identity : @xmath38 where the measure @xmath39 gives the density of degrees of freedom in space , given by the nyquist rate .",
    "this overcomplete resolution of the identity is analogous to that for coherent states @xmath40 @xmath41 where the measure @xmath42 gives the density of independent states in phase space .",
    "the space of bandlimited functions is a reproducing kernel hilbert space @xcite .",
    "this means that any function in the space can be recovered by means of the reproducing kernel @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we now apply the sampling theorem to a quantum field @xmath45 in 1 + 1 dimensions , with a hilbert space @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 be an eigenstate of the field operator obeying @xmath48 @xmath49 for some real - valued function of eigenvalues , @xmath50 .",
    "note that in a continuum field theory without a cutoff , @xmath51 is not an operator but an operator - valued distribution which must be smeared with a suitable test function to obtain an operator . in the bandlimited theory ,",
    "the cutoff acts as an effective smearing function , and @xmath51 is a genuine operator , though still unbounded .",
    "now let @xmath52 be the subspace spanned by the eigenstates of @xmath45 where the corresponding functions of eigenvalues @xmath50 are functions bandlimited by @xmath8 .",
    "because @xmath50 is a bandlimited function , the eigenvalue @xmath14 at any point @xmath53 can be determined by the knowledge of the eigenvalues @xmath18 at all of the points @xmath36 on a sampling lattice @xmath26 .",

    "since @xmath52 is the span of these eigenstates , the action of @xmath54 is determined by that of @xmath56 for all states in @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we can write : @xmath57 \\hat{\\phi}(x_n^{(\\alpha)}).\\ ] ] therefore , the operators @xmath56 form a complete set of commuting observables for any @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that there are many lattices on which the field can be represented means that the localization of the degrees of freedom is non - trivial . in the next section",
    "we will briefly examine this , but it will be studied further in later sections of the paper .      in a bandlimited field theory , the local harmonic oscillators , i.e. , the local degrees of freedom @xmath14 , are not all independent .",
    "namely , a set of degrees of freedom @xmath58 is linearly independent only if the @xmath59 all belong to the same sampling lattice .",
    "the field @xmath14 at any other spatial point @xmath24 can then be reconstructed from the amplitudes @xmath58 . in this section",
    "we will construct a a function that describes the spatial volume occupied by a set of degrees of freedom @xmath60 .    to this end",
    ", consider the subspace spanned by @xmath61 position eigenvectors @xmath62 of first quantization ( i.e. , they can be represented as number - valued function over space ) .",
    "we will allow that they are not all from the same nyquist lattice , and therefore they are generally not orthogonal .",
    "intuitively , the vector @xmath63 characterizes the spatial profile of the field degree of freedom @xmath64 located at this point .",
    "let us now construct the projector onto this subspace , in the basis of these @xmath61 position vectors .",
    "first , we map the position vectors to an orthogonal basis @xmath65 the projector onto this subspace is given by @xmath66 we can express the elements of the projector in the non - orthogonal basis @xmath62 using the reproducing kernel , @xmath67 viewing @xmath68 as the @xmath69 element of an @xmath70 matrix @xmath71 , we can write @xmath72    inserting the resolution of identity , we can write this projector in the continuum basis : @xmath73 note that the trace of this operator is @xmath61 , since it is simply the identity on an @xmath61-dimensional subspace .",
    "this trace is represented in the continuum basis as an integral over the diagonal elements of the integral kernel .",
    "we can interpret the diagonal elements of this projector in the continuum basis ( i.e. , as a function of @xmath53 ) as the spatial profile of the @xmath61 vectors @xmath62 .",
    "we can then visualise the spatial profile of @xmath61 degrees of freedom for various spacings between the degrees of freedom ; this is illustrated in figure  [ plt : spatial_profile ] , for 5 points .",
    "is equal to 1 .",
    "the sample points are centred at @xmath74 .",
    "we see that for spacings above the nyquist spacing , the degrees of freedom occupy a region consisting of @xmath75 disjoint intervals of length @xmath76 surrounding each sample point .",
    "below the nyquist spacing , the degrees of freedom merge to occupy a single interval of length @xmath77 .",
    "this interval does not decrease in size even as the sampling points are taken on top of one another .",
    ", width=316,height=240 ]    we see that for sampling point separations larger than the nyquist spacing ( shown in the region @xmath78 on the vertical axis ) , the degrees of freedom are clearly localized about the chosen sampling points and they are nonlocal on the order of the cutoff length ( in the horizontal axis ) . when the points are spaced close to the nyquist spacing ( i.e. , spacing of 1 )",
    ", the spatial profiles of the points converge to form a volume of length 5 .",
    "the surprising point illustrated by this plot is that when the points are spaced closer than a nyquist spacing apart , the points still describe a spatial volume equivalent to the spatial volume described by the points when they are spaced at the nyquist spacing .",
    "thus we see that each point can be localized to a unit of volume , and that these volume elements are incompressible , in the sense that @xmath61 points pushed close together still describe an interval of length @xmath61 .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that , because of the cutoff , placing the sampling points closer than a nyquist spacing should not uncover new degrees of freedom .",
    "what is surprising but in hindsight plausible is that even when @xmath61 sample points are closer than the nyquist spacing they still access @xmath61 degrees of freedom .",
    "we will return to this issue in the context of quantum fields in section  [ section : localization ] .",
    "we would now like to see the effect that bandlimiting a quantum field has on the commutation relations and correlation functions of the ground state of the field .",
    "the particular fields we will hereafter be considering are 1 + 1 dimensional massless scalar quantum fields with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath8 and infrared cutoff @xmath79 imposed on the spatial momentum , so that @xmath80 . note that bandlimited functions which have support on @xmath81 in fourier space form a subspace of the space of functions with support on @xmath82 . thus the above sampling theorem also applies to these functions .",

    "we have shown how the entanglement entropy of a set of samples of a bandlimited quantum field depends on the number of samples taken and on the spacing between samples . for spacings larger than the nyquist spacing",

    "there is a sharp transition . for samples spaced at a nyquist spacing or closer",
    ", the entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with the number of samples , with a coefficient that is independent of the spacing .",
    "we will now show how this is a consequence of each mode of the field occupying an incompressible volume of space , which we will call a planck volume .    since the degrees of freedom on all sample points of a nyquist lattice is equivalent to the entire field",
    ", one can interpret each degree of freedom on the nyquist lattice as representing information roughly contained in a planck volume centered at the sample point .",
    "thus , we can interpret sampling a set of points on a nyquist lattice as sampling the corresponding interval of the field .",
    "if we sample finitely many contiguous degrees of freedom on a nyquist lattice , the resulting entanglement entropy is generated by the correlations cut across the boundary of the interval .",
    "thus , the entanglement entropy varies logarithmically with the number of points sampled , @xmath61 , since they describe an interval of length @xmath275 .",
    "if the sample points we take are spaced farther than a nyquist spacing , the corresponding planck volumes centered at these sample points will be disjoint .",
    "therefore , the local correlations around each point which contribute to the entanglement entropy will mostly be independent .",
    "therefore , the entanglement entropy for points which are well - separated will scale linearly with the number of sampled degrees of freedom , as we demonstrated above .",
    "the most interesting case is the case of oversampling .",
    "when the sampled degrees of freedom are pushed very close together , we find that the entropy varies logarithmically with the number of degrees of freedom sampled . as the degrees of freedom are taken together one might expect to probe only a single planck volume , and hence find a smaller entropy . if the @xmath61 points are almost on top of one another , the correlations at the boundary of the overlapping planck volumes would generate entanglement entropy roughly equivalent to the entanglement entropy of a single sampled degree of freedom , rather than @xmath61 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , from the results of the entropy calculation , it seems that the @xmath61 degrees of freedom correspond to a larger , effective volume the size of the original volume described by the @xmath61 contiguous nyquist - spaced points before they were pushed together .    we can estimate the size of this effective volume as follows .",
    "first , we take a set of @xmath61 sample points with some equidistant spacing , which we shall denote subsystem @xmath276 .",
    "now we include another sample point which we initially place very far from these @xmath61 sample points , which we shall denote subsystem @xmath277 .",
    "this point will be used as a probe to localize the points in subsystem @xmath276 , using the mutual information @xmath278 where @xmath279 , @xmath280 are the entanglement entropies of the subsystems @xmath276 and @xmath277 ( respectively ) , and @xmath281 is the entanglement entropy of the combined system . while the probe point @xmath277 remains far away , the mutual information will be small because the correlations between @xmath276 and @xmath277 are small .",
    "when @xmath277 approaches the system of @xmath61 points , the mutual information will increase as the two subsystems become more correlated .",
    "we can use the increase of the mutual information @xmath282 as an indicator of the extent of the subsystem @xmath276 .",
    "in particular , we can map the boundary of @xmath276 for various values of the spacing between the @xmath61 points .",
    "if the points spaced far below the nyquist spacing indeed describe an effective volume of @xmath283 planck volumes in size , then we should see the boundary of the subsystem at the edge of this region .    in figure  [ plt : explorer_mutinfo ]",
    "we see this is the case for a subsystem of @xmath284 points . when the points in the interval are spaced farther than a nyquist spacing ( in the upper region of the graph ) , we can clearly identify the region of space that they occupy , which is centered at each sample point and on the order of a planck volume in size .",
    "when the spacing approaches the nyquist spacing , the points begin to occupy a single interval of roughly @xmath284 planck volumes in size .",
    "as the spacing decreases below the nyquist spacing , the size of this interval ceases to decrease , indicating that the sample points describe the same volume of space regardless of their positions below the nyquist spacing .",
    "therefore , the sample points each describe an independent volume of space of planckian size . in this sense ,",
    "the planck volumes described by the individual degrees of freedom are incompressible .",
    "this behavior shows how the field is able to have a finite information density , while still allowing arbitrarily closely spaced probes .",

    "above we have examined the effect of the ultraviolet cutoff on the calculation of the entanglement entropy of a bandlimited quantum field . here",

    "the entropy diverges as a double logarithm with the infrared cutoff .",
    "this infrared divergence is a special feature of 1 + 1 dimensions and arises due to a build - up of long range correlations in the field .",
    "we saw in section [ section : sampling ] that the @xmath50-@xmath50 correlations decay very slowly with the point separation , and are only suppressed on the order of the longest wavelength @xmath287 .",
    "if we remove the infrared cutoff , we allow for infinitely long wavelengths , and thus divergent correlations .    in our above numerical results for calculating the entanglement entropy of a quantum field on a nyquist lattice",
    ", we perform a numerical fit of the data to determine the coefficients of the equation @xmath288 this numerical fit was also performed for various values of the infrared cutoff , @xmath289 $ ] .",
    "we find that the leading order behaviour of @xmath290 in this range is @xmath291 the coefficient @xmath290 agrees with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite ( up to a constant ) .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath292 , the infrared cutoff @xmath79 has the same effect on the entropy as a small mass @xcite .",

    "expanding the field in a spatial fourier series , @xmath301 where @xmath302 , one obtains a discrete set of momentum modes @xmath303 .",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff will be imposed by restricting the set of allowable @xmath304 to @xmath305 .",
    "we see that for @xmath306 there will be no zero mode , so the @xmath50-@xmath50 correlations are finite , but there will be an infrared divergence as @xmath307 .",

    "similar to the calculation performed above , we shall calculate the entanglement entropy associated with tracing out the field oscillator at a single point .",
    "the relevant diagonal elements of the correlation matrices are : @xmath293 & = & i \\frac{2k}{l},\\\\ \\langle \\phi^2(x ) \\rangle & = & \\frac{1}{2\\alpha } + \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\left [ \\psi \\left(k-\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}+1 \\right ) \\right .",

    "we see that now instead of a logarithmic infrared divergence of @xmath313 , with a discrete set of modes the correlation function diverges as @xmath314 as @xmath307 . in this limit ,",
    "the leading order behaviour of the symplectic eigenvalues is @xmath315 the corresponding entanglement entropy is @xmath316 numerical calculations were performed with multiple points traced out , and the observed behaviour in the limit @xmath307 agrees with that in equation .    for our ultraviolet and infrared bandlimited quantum field on the real line , the maximum allowable wavelength is @xmath317 . for periodic boundary conditions , the maximum wavelength is @xmath318 .",
    "thus , we can compare and summarise the infrared behaviour of the entanglement entropy as    * for a continuous set of modes : @xmath319 * for a discrete set of modes : @xmath320    in the case of boundary conditions that are periodic up to a phase , the entropy diverges more quickly .",
    "this is plausible since this case is a description of a field on a circle , and any two points on this circle coupled to one another an arbitrary number of times in the limit @xmath321 .",
    "shannon sampling , which in information theory establishes the equivalence of continuous and discrete information , also yields a simple model for how a natural ultraviolet cutoff at the planck scale might manifest itself in qft .",
    "namely , when approaching the planck scale from lower energies , where qft is still valid , quantum fields are modeled as being bandlimited .    within this model , we probed the localization of the quantum field s degrees of freedom by tracking the behaviour of the vacuum entanglement entropy .",
    "we found that the degrees of freedom of the quantum field , i.e. , the local field oscillators , are non - local but can be localized down to the planck - scale . in fact , we found that the local degrees of freedom occupy incompressible planck - scale volumes , in the sense that @xmath61 degrees of freedom always describe @xmath61 planck volumes regardless of the distance between them .",
    "the tools that we outlined in this paper are applicable also to the study of bandlimited quantum fields in higher dimensions , and to fermionic fields .    for the case of higher dimensions , we conjecture that we will continue to see incompressibility of the field degrees of freedom , i.e. , a plateau in the entanglement entropy for spacings below the nyquist spacing .",
    "a system of @xmath61 lattice points should continue to probe a region of @xmath61 planck volumes even if they are sub - nyquist spaced . in higher dimensions",
    "it will be interesting to see how the shape of this region changes with the relative location of the sample points .",
    "moreover , at larger than nyquist spacings , we expect to find an infrared plateau .",
    "this is because the vacuum correlations decay over shorter distances in higher dimensions and do , therefore , not exhibit the infrared divergences that soften the area scaling to a logarithmic scaling in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "our approach to studying localization and vacuum entanglement should also work for quantum fields on curved spacetimes . to this end , the generalization of shannon sampling theory to curved spaces developed in @xcite can be used .",
    "it will be interesting , in particular , to determine how the localizability of the fundamental field oscillator degrees of freedom is affected by curvature and horizons , and in particular , how this may affect hawking radiation .",
    "a similar hard momentum cutoff was considered in @xcite , and it should be interesting to apply our new methods to that case .    a further direction of great interest would be to study the entanglement entropy and the localization of degrees of freedom of fields with a fully covariant ultraviolet cutoff . in this case , the bandlimitation would be imposed by cutting off the spectrum of a covariant laplacian ( on riemannian manifolds ) or a dalembert operator ( on lorentzian manifolds ) @xcite . to this end , it may be useful to express the entropy purely in terms of spacetime correlation functions @xcite",
    ", i.e. , without reference to the canonical formalism .",
    "we remark that it has been argued that if the entanglement entropy is finite and obeys a form of the clausius relation , then einstein s equation emerges as a thermodynamic equation of state @xcite . thus having a regulator that is both covariant and cuts off the entanglement entropy could be a key step toward quantum gravity",
    ".    it should also be very interesting to study the interaction of unruh - dewitt detectors with the bandlimited quantum fields .",
    "unruh dewitt detectors would describe explicit means to sample the quantum fields , and this could , therefore , constitute a further step towards the quantization of sampling theory . an interesting question that then arises",
    "is how the spatial profile of an unruh - dewitt detector interacts with the spatial profile of the degrees of freedom .",
    "another key question that arises with the quantization of sampling theory follows from the fact that , in classical sampling theory , the reconstruction of a function from a lattice with non - equidistant sample points is more sensitive to noise in the sample measurements than reconstruction from a lattice with equidistant sample points .",
    "this , therefore , raises the interesting question if or to what extent quantum noise may interfere with the ability to use significantly irregularly - spaced lattices .",
    "one of our central results is that the entanglement entropy does not decrease significantly as the spacing is decreased to below the nyquist spacing . in classical sampling theory",
    "too a curious phenomenon is known to arise as the spacing is decreased to below the nyquist spacing , namely the phenomenon of superoscillations .",
    "superoscillations in a bandlimited function are a finite set of oscillations that oscillate faster than the highest fourier component in the signal @xcite .",
    "superoscillations are difficult to generate and rarely occur naturally but they have become an active field of investigation , also in engineering , because of their potential for superresolution . an open problem in this field is to quantify the prevalence of superoscillations in random signals . in our analogous classical calculation , we obtained probability distributions for observing particular field values on an arbitrary sampling lattice .",
    "these distributions could be used to calculate the probability for finding the field in any particular superoscillatory configuration .",
    "it might be possible to find in this way a practical measure of classical or quantum field fluctuations that is sensitive specifically to the occurrence of superoscillatory behaviour .",
    "a key question that we addressed in this paper has been the question of how a bounded _ continuous region can support only a finite number of degrees of freedom . in our model for a natural ultraviolet cutoff , this is accomplished by the quantum field degrees of freedom at distinct spacetime points not being independent . as a consequence , probing with too many operators in a small region simply causes one to probe a larger region of space .",
    "this means that the degrees of freedom of the theory are encoded redundantly on a single spatial slice . _",
    "in fact it has recently been argued that , similarly , significant redundancy is present in the bulk field theory in ads / cft @xcite .",
    "the redundancy implied by holography appears to be more extreme , however , since the number of degrees of freedom is bounded by area rather than volume . to obtain this more drastic reduction",
    ", the nontrivial commutation relations coming from gravitation interaction may provide some clues @xcite .",
    "one may also take a cue from holography by trying to redundantly encode the degrees of freedom of a quantum field in a space of higher dimension .",
    "finally , we note that the hyperbolic geometry of anti - de sitter space suggests that an encoding based on wavelets may have some connection to holography @xcite . wavelet theory and shannon sampling theory are closely related and the quantization of wavelet theory should be possible along the lines that we developed here .",

    "jp also acknowledges support through the ontario graduate scholarhip ( ogs ) program .",
    "here we will briefly review the functional analytic structure of sampling theory , as first shown in @xcite .",
    "the functional analytic view is powerful because it ultimately reduces sampling theory to the simple fact that when a hilbert space vector is known in one basis then it is known in all bases .",
    "a key point here is the distinction between symmetric and self - adjoint operators . by the spectral theorem , each self - adjoint operator possesses a unique diagonalization , whereas a simple symmetric operator does not , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a certain type of simple symmetric operator , however , possesses a family of self - adjoint extensions , and their diagonalizations and spectra provide the sampling lattices of sampling theory .",
    "( the functional analytic view therefore also allows one to work with varying nyquist rates , which can occur in signal processing as well as in curved spacetimes . )    indeed , when acting upon the space of functions bandlimited by some maximum frequency @xmath8 , the usual position operator from first quantization , @xmath322 , is symmetric but not self - adjoint . to see this ,",
    "recall that for an operator @xmath322 to be symmetric , it must obey @xmath323 for all @xmath324 , where @xmath325 is the domain of @xmath322 .",
    "equivalently , an operator is symmetric if and only if its expectation value is real for all vectors in its domain : @xmath326 . for an operator to be self - adjoint",
    ", it must be symmetric and its domain must coincide with the domain of its adjoint , i.e. , @xmath327 @xmath328 and @xmath329 .    indeed , the position operator @xmath322 with domain restricted to the space of bandlimited functions is symmetric , but the domain of its adjoint is a larger space of functions .",
    "this is most easily seen in the momentum eigenbasis . in this basis , the space of physical wavefunctions , and therefore the domain of @xmath322 , is the space of functions @xmath330\\vert \\phi\\in ac[-\\omega,\\omega],\\right .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left .",
    "\\phi'\\in l^2[-\\omega,\\omega ] , \\phi(-\\omega)=\\phi(\\omega ) = 0\\right    \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath331 $ ] denotes the space of absolutely continuous functions .",
    "notice that @xmath325 contains only functions which obey dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast , the domain of @xmath332 is the larger function space obtained by not imposing any boundary conditions .",
    "this can be seen from the definition of @xmath332 : @xmath333 we see from the last line that as long as @xmath334 is in the domain of @xmath322 ( thus obeys dirichlet boundary conditions on the interval @xmath335 $ ] in fourier space ) , then we can define the adjoint of @xmath332 as @xmath336 in the momentum representation .",
    "however , since we did not need to impose boundary conditions on @xmath337 , we have that @xmath338 .    crucially now",
    ", it is possible to extend the domain of @xmath322 so that the extension is a self - adjoint operator .",
    "this operator is called a self - adjoint extension of @xmath322 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . in our situation",
    ", we can perform this extension by enlarging the domain of @xmath322 to include functions with periodic boundary conditions up to a phase on the interval @xmath335 $ ] in fourier space , i.e. , @xmath339 .",
    "we shall denote the self - adjoint extension corresponding to the particular phase @xmath340 as @xmath341 , thus the family of self - adjoint extensions is parametrized by @xmath22 .",
    "now we will show that the operators @xmath341 are indeed self - adjoint .",
    "the definition of the adjoint of @xmath342 gives @xmath343 we see that the adjoint of @xmath341 is defined as @xmath336 in the momentum basis provided that @xmath337 also obeys the boundary condition @xmath344 .",
    "therefore we see @xmath345 , and so @xmath341 is self - adjoint .",
    "now , since the operators @xmath341 are self - adjoint , they have spectral decompositions .",
    "the spectrum of the operator @xmath341 ( for fixed @xmath30 ) is discrete , @xmath346 , and describes a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors , @xmath347 , are represented in the momentum eigenbasis as @xmath348 these eigenvectors are orthogonal and admit a resolution of the identity : @xmath349 .",
    "crucially , the position eigenvectors from different self - adjoint extensions are not orthogonal : @xmath350.\\ ] ] note that the union of the spectra of the entire family of self - adjoint extensions provides a covering of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to construct an overcomplete continuum basis by taking the union of eigenbases of the family of self - adjoint extensions , i.e. , @xmath351 .",

    "<S> we consider a model for a planck scale ultraviolet cutoff which is based on shannon sampling . </S>",
    "<S> shannon sampling originated in information theory , where it expresses the equivalence of continuous and discrete representations of information . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to quantum field theory , shannon sampling expresses a hard ultraviolet cutoff in the form of a bandlimitation . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces nonlocality at the cutoff scale in a way that is more subtle than a simple discretization of space : quantum fields can then be represented as either living on continuous space or , entirely equivalently , as living on any one lattice whose average spacing is sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly calculate vacuum entanglement entropies in 1 + 1 dimension and we find a transition between logarithmic and linear scaling of the entropy , which is the expected 1 + 1 dimensional analog of the transition from an area to a volume law . </S>",
    "<S> we also use entanglement entropy and mutual information as measures to probe in detail the localizability of the field degrees of freedom . we find that , even though neither translation nor rotation invariance are broken , each field degree of freedom occupies an incompressible volume of space , indicating a finite information density . </S>"
