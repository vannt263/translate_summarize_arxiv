    "a quantum computer constructed from ballistic electron waveguides consists of network of dual - waveguide qubits , @xmath0 gates and entangling regions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the network is hard wired and is constructed to perform specific computations .",
    "a computation begins by injecting electrons into the input end of the device where they subsequently travel towards the output end of the device encountering @xmath0 gates and entangling regions along the way .",
    "the electrons emerge on the output end of the device and the computation is completed .",
    "an electron waveguide qubit consists of two parallel waveguides .",
    "an electron in one waveguide corresponds to a qubit state @xmath3 while an electron in the other waveguide corresponds to a qubit state @xmath4 .",
    "as was shown in @xcite a @xmath0 gate can be implemented in a @xmath2 based system of electron waveguides by creating a cavity connecting the waveguides .",
    "the cavity consists of a region of reduced potential between the two waveguides of a single qubit and allows the tunneling of the electron between the waveguides . a correct choice of the parameters of the cavity region creates an `` electron beam splitter '' , so that a qubit initially in either the @xmath3 or @xmath4 state is in an equal superposition of the two after the electron passes through the cavity .",
    "it has been shown that the fidelity of a computation in these waveguide networks is strongly influenced by reflection of electron probability at the @xmath0 gates @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to characterize the reflection properties of these @xmath0 gate regions in a manner that is experimentally measurable .",
    "the equal splitting of electron probability into each of the outgoing waveguides does not guarantee a high fidelity gate , as some or most of the electron probability could still be reflected back to the input side of the gate .",
    "below we show that the shot noise inherent in a @xmath0 gate can provide another means for determining the quality of a particular @xmath0 implementation .",
    "shot noise in mesoscopic semi - conductor wires has been studied extensively @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the noise itself is due to the quantization of electron charge and is seen at very low temperatures when the thermal noise is small . in electron waveguides ,",
    "ballistic leads are connected to large reservoir regions where electrons can enter the leads without being scattered .",
    "the leads are then connected to a scattering region , where the scattering amplitudes for the scattering region are known .",
    "the shot noise measured in the current in the leads then can be expressed in terms of the scattering amplitudes and the distribution functions that describe the reservoirs .",
    "below we first describe the @xmath0 gate in terms of leads , reservoirs and a scattering region .",
    "we then use a scattering analysis to find the zero frequency shot noise in the leads connected to the @xmath0 gate .",
    "once the shot noise for a general @xmath0 gate is presented , a specific gate is studied which represents the scattering properties found in the numerically modeled gate in @xcite .",
    "the shot noise is shown to be a very good indicator of the overall fidelity of a physical @xmath0 gate in electron waveguide qubits .",
    "a ballistic electron waveguide qubit consists of two parallel waveguides coupled by cavities which allow flow of electron probability amplitude between the two waveguides which form the qubit .",
    "the distribution of the electron probability amplitude between the two waveguides represents the state of the qubit .",
    "a @xmath0 gate is a cavity which connects the waveguides and through which the electron can tunnel to create an equal superposition of states @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we will follow a scattering approach to describe the shot noise associated with a ballistic electron waveguide @xmath0 gate @xcite .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 gate consisting of four straight leads , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 connected to a scattering region where an incoming electron may be scattered into any of the four leads ( fig .",
    "[ gate ] ) .     gate .",
    "four leads @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are connected to the scattering region where electron probability may tunnel between the waveguides .",
    "electrons in the upper two leads , @xmath5 or @xmath7 , correspond to a qubit state of @xmath4 .",
    "electrons in the lower two leads , @xmath6 or @xmath8 , correspond to a qubit state of @xmath3 .",
    "the operators @xmath9 annihilate electrons in the incoming state in lead @xmath10 .",
    "the operators @xmath11 annihilate electrons in the outgoing state in lead @xmath10 . ]",
    "an electron traveling in one of the leads propagates freely and can be entering or leaving the scattering region .",
    "each of the four leads is connected to a separate reservoir of electrons at temperature @xmath12 and distributed according to the fermi distribution function @xmath13^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the chemical potential of reservoir @xmath15 .",
    "current is driven through the system by biasing one or more of the reservoirs at a small negative potential relative to the other reservoirs .",
    "we assume the energy of the incoming electrons in the system can be controlled such that only the first transverse mode is occupied in the waveguide and we neglect any scattering of electrons into other transverse modes .",
    "the electron waveguides then can be treated as quasi - one - dimensional quantum wires .",
    "we use creation and annihilation operators to describe electrons in scattering states in the leads .",
    "operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 create and annihilate _ incoming _ electrons in lead @xmath10 . operators @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 create and annihilate _ outgoing _ electrons in lead @xmath10 .",
    "the operators obey the commutation relation , @xmath20    the operators for incoming states are related to the operators for the outgoing states by a scattering matrix , @xmath1 , so that @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the probability amplitude for reflection ( transmission ) of the electron from lead @xmath25 to lead @xmath10 .",
    "the creation operators are related by the hermitian conjugate of the @xmath1-matrix .",

    "the normalization of the field operators conserves current in the system .",

    "the spectral density becomes independent of the spatial variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    for our study of the @xmath0 gate",

    "@xcite found a set of numerical parameters ( spatial size , potential barrier height , incident energy ) which allow for a functioning @xmath0 gate in a @xmath2 based waveguide system .",

    "the noise in the single lead will be at a maximum any time there is a probability of @xmath58 that an electron will exit the gate in that lead , but this says nothing about the probability that an electron will exit any of the other leads . shot noise measurements across the two leads on the output side of the device do , however ,",
    "allow for the unique determination of the fidelity of a @xmath0 gate . in a physical system",
    "it may be useful to measure the fidelity of the gate in this manner , as it is possible to have an equal splitting of the current through such a gate but also contain some small amount of reflection back into the originating lead .",
    "shot noise measurements may then be able to differentiate a gate which simply splits an incoming current equally from a gate which behaves as a high fidelity @xmath0 gate .",
    "the construction of high - fidelity @xmath0 gates in ballistic electron waveguide networks is essential to the eventual implementation of the quantum algorithms .",
    "the reflection of electron probability at the @xmath0 gates causes a rapid decay of overall computation fidelity .",
    "measurements of the shot noise across leads on the output side of a gate can describe the fidelity characteristics of the gate . shot noise measurements can be used to discriminate between an electron waveguide gate that simply splits incoming current , and one which is of high - fidelity with very little reflection back towards the input side of the device .",
