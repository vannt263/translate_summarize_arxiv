    "] to this end , we @xcite have undertaken a survey of 21-cm absorption of background radio sources at various impact parameters in the disks of intervening , nearby galaxies ( @xmath3 , fig .",
    "[ distbn ] ) .    for impact parameters of @xmath4 kpc ,",
    "the  detection rate is approximately 50 per - cent @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find a significantly lower detection rate ( 4 per - cent ) , which they attribute to the unbiased nature of their sample .",
    "that is , no target pre - selection based upon impact parameter nor the nature of the background source . for a given sight - line",
    ", a background radio galaxy could result in a lower covering factor , reducing the observed optical depth in comparison to a quasar ( see sect .",
    "[ ebss ] ) .",
    "although the gas density in a galaxy is known to decrease with galactocentric radius ( e.g. @xcite ) , none of the previous surveys have found convincing evidence of a decrease in 21-cm absorption strength with impact parameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is despite evidence of an anti - correlation between the lyman-  and civ equivalent widths and the impact parameter being well established in the optical / uv bands ( e.g. @xcite ) . by adding the latest results @xcite to the previously published data and incorporating the limits , obtained from the non - detections , here we report the first clear evidence of an anti - correlation between the 21-cm absorption strength and the impact parameter .",
    "there are now 90 spectral line observations of radio source sight - lines through the disks of galaxies ( summarised in table  [ table1 ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,>,^,^ \" , ]     references : h75  @xcite , b88 ",

    "these are added to the 16 detected sight - lines as censored data points . for the bivariate data ,",
    "a generalised non - parametric kendall - tau test gives a probability of @xmath7 of the observed @xmath8@xmath9 anti - correlation correlation arising by chance , which is significant at @xmath10 , assuming gaussian statistics ( fig .",
    "[ n - impact ] , top panel ) .",
    "as seen from table [ table1 ] , only 14 of the 90 sight - lines were originally targetted as known metal - line absorbers , although these drive the correlation giving a @xmath11 significance from just 14 data points . however , this is due to the metal - line absorbers constituting 11 of the 16 detections , which define the parent population against which the limits are quantified , thus requiring their inclusion .    the limits may also be included in the binned univariate data to give the mean @xmath12 value of each bin , via the kaplan ",
    "meier estimator which gives a maximum - likelihood estimate based upon the parent population @xcite . presenting the data thus , it is visually apparent that the absorption strength does decrease with increasing impact parameter ( fig .",
    "[ n - impact ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "in addition to the generalised kendall - tau test and the kaplan  meier estimates , we split the data in half via the median impact parameter : at @xmath13 kpc , there are 14 detections and 31 non - detections , that is a 31.1 per - cent detection rate .",
    "applying this to the @xmath14 kpc bin , gives a binomial probability of @xmath15 of obtaining two detections or fewer out of 45 sight - lines , which is significant at @xmath16 .",
    "although by the inclusion of the limits , we see a decrease in absorption strength with impact parameter , the sample is heterogeneous , comprising a variety of background source classifications ( discussed in sect .",
    "[ ebss ] ) , in addition to potential differences in the foreground absorbing galaxies .",
    "these may arise from the search strategy of each individual survey , whether an unbiased survey towards galaxy  quasar pairs or the selection of _ known _ metal - line absorbers .",
    "the detection rate of the former is just 7% , compared to 79 per - cent for the latter , with these also tending to be at low impact parameters ( fig .",
    "[ n - impact ] ) .",
    "such metal - line absorbers also comprise the foreground galaxies in the optical surveys which exhibit an equivalent width ",
    "impact parameter anticorrelation ( sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) .    until all of the sample is observed and their metallicities quantified ,",
    "this possible bias can not be directly removed .",
    "however , both metallicity and equivalent width appear to be correlated with galaxy size ( @xcite ) and so a potentially wide range of metallicities is expected to reflect a large range of galaxy sizes .",
    "this could have the effect of a given impact parameter , which lies well within the disk for an @xmath17 ( high metallicity ) galaxy , being located well outside the disk of a dwarf galaxy . in order to account for this ,",
    "we normalise each impact parameter by the luminosity of the galaxy : as described in @xcite , for each galaxy we obtain the photometry from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , correcting each value for galactic extinction @xcite before fitting to the required wavelength in the galaxy rest - frame .",
    "we summarise the derived blue - band luminosities in fig .",
    "[ l - blue ] .    using these to normalise the impact parameter , via the same @xmath18 correction as @xcite",
    ",    we find the absorption strength ",
    "impact parameter anti - correlation retains a similar significance , although with 16 fewer data points . as before , we can also compare detection rates above and below the median ( normalised ) impact parameter : at @xmath19 kpc , there are 9 detections and 28 non - detections , that is a 24.3 per - cent detection rate .",
    "applying this to the @xmath20 kpc bin , gives a binomial probability of @xmath21 of obtaining two or fewer detections out of 37 sight - lines , which is significant at @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite also normalise the impact parameter by the near - infrared luminosity , since this is less susceptible to extinction and irregularities caused by star formation , providing a better tracer of the total stellar mass .    normalising the impact parameter , the significance of the anti - correlation increases ( fig .",
    "[ l - k ] ) and , again comparing detection rates above and below the median ( normalised ) impact parameter : at @xmath23 kpc , there are 10 detections and 21 non - detections , that is a 30.5 per - cent detection rate . applying this to the @xmath24 kpc bin , gives a binomial probability of @xmath25 of obtaining one detection or fewer out of 33 sight - lines , which is significant at @xmath26 .",
    "since we have both the blue and near - infrared luminosities for many of the galaxies , we can verify that the observed decrease in @xmath12 with impact parameter is not dominated by a colour bias , where the redder ( and presumably , dustier ) galaxies are more hospitable to the presence of cool gas . in fig .",
    "[ colour ] we    plot the 21-cm absorption strength against the @xmath27 colour , where no correlation is apparent , leaving the decrease in gas density with impact parameter the major most likely cause .",
    "we also note that the known metal - line systems do exhibit some reddening ( @xmath28 ) , which is consistent with the metallicity  dust ( and molecular fraction ) relation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .      as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , in addition to the impact parameter , it is believed that the extent of the background source can have an effect on the 21-cm detection rate .",
    "specifically , for a given absorption cross section pc @xcite .",
    "] different background source sizes will have different observed optical depths , @xmath29 , according to @xmath30 in the optically thin regime @xcite . ] , where the observed optical depth is defined as the ratio of the line depth to the continuum ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "given that the covering factor ranges over @xmath32 for zero to full coverage of the background flux , larger background sources could give systematically lower observed optical depths .",
    "that is , we may expect the more compact quasar sight - lines to give a higher detection rate than those of radio galaxies .    addressing this , from the ned classifications , contrary to our expectations , we find a higher ( @xmath33 per - cent ) detection rate towards radio galaxies compared to the quasars ( @xmath34 per - cent , fig .",
    "[ sl ] ) .    performing a pearson @xmath35statistic test and applying yates s correction for continuity gives a significance of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the null hypothesis that the detection rates are the equal for radio galaxies and quasars can not be rejected .",
    "it is generally accepted that the turnover frequency of a radio source is anti - correlated with its extent ( e.g. @xcite ) , with flat spectral indices arising from radio emission projected along our line - of - sight , thus also appearing more compact .",
    "therefore , in the absence of high resolution radio images , we can use any clustering of either or both the turnover frequency / spectral index to gauge whether an unclassified background source is likely to be a quasar or a radio galaxy .",
    "we therefore compiled the photometry of each background source and , using the methods described in @xcite , determined the rest - frame turnover frequency , @xmath37 , and spectral index at a rest frequency of 1.4  ghz , @xmath38 .",
    "from this ( fig .",
    "[ to - si ] ) , we see that both the radio galaxies and unclassified sources , for which both @xmath37 and @xmath38 could be determined , are too few in number to exhibit any clustering , which is absent from the sources classified as qsos in any case .",
    "thus , at least at present , this method is of little use in predicting the nature of the background source . based upon this limited sample ,",
    "however , we see that , while there is a large overlap in the spectral indices ( although the detections are more `` flat '' , @xmath39 ) , the detections and non - detections have distinct mean turnover frequencies ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 hz , respectively ) . since the turnover frequency is anti - correlated with the source size ( e.g. @xcite ) , this is consistent with a detection bias towards the more compact radio sources , indicating that the covering factor is important .      in the optically thin regime ( equ .",
    "[ tau_eq ] ) , the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath0 [ ] , is related to the absorption strength via @xmath42 where @xmath43 [ k ] is the spin temperature of the gas and @xmath44 [ ] the velocity integrated optical depth of the absorption . the comparison of @xmath44 with @xmath0 , from lyman-  ( @xmath45   ) observations , has shown an increase in @xmath46 with redshift , possibly suggesting an evolution in the spin temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , the effect can adequately be accounted for by a decrease in @xmath47 with redshift , due to the geometry effects of an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "for this near - by sample we have the opportunity to determine whether @xmath46 generally varies with galactocentric radius , which could possibly introduce a beam - filling effect , where the mean value of @xmath46 within the beam could also contribute to a redshift dependence . given that the gas is optically thin , for the low redshifts of the sample ( fig .  [ distbn ] ) , where 21-cm emission can be detected ( @xmath48 , @xcite ) , the column density can be obtained directly from the brightness temperature of the line emission , @xmath49 [ k ] , via @xmath50 which in conjunction with equ .",
    "[ n_eq ] yields @xmath46 . plotting this ( fig .",
    "[ toverf ] ) ,    we see no evidence of a variation in @xmath46 with the normalised impact parameter over @xmath51  kpc , which corresponds to the inner @xmath52 kpc of galactocentric radius .    this is consistent the result of @xcite , who find remarkably little variation in the spin temperature over radii of 825  kpc in the milky way , despite both the 21-cm emission and absorption strengths varying by two orders of magnitudes .      by assuming the known  column density distribution of the milky way",
    ", we can estimate the approximate orientation of the average  absorbing disk , based upon the @xmath8@xmath9 relationship : the galactic volume density of the neutral gas exhibits an exponential decrease with galactocentric radius according to @xmath53 , where @xmath54  and the scale - length @xmath55  kpc @xcite .",
    "the column density at each value of @xmath9 is obtained from the volume density via @xmath56 , where @xmath57 for a face - on ( @xmath58 ) disk , is given by the flare factor , @xmath59 , which describes the flaring of the  gas with galactocentric radius @xcite . ] and @xmath60 for an edge - on ( @xmath61 ) disk ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .    from this , the face - on galactic disk appears to better trace the binned integrated optical depth values , again with @xmath62  k remaining approximately consistent with galactocentric radius out to @xmath63 kpc , beyond which this falls to @xmath64  k ( fig . [ toverf ] ) .",
    "applying the edge - on galactic disk would give much larger values of @xmath46 , due either to very high spin temperatures and/or very low covering factors , the latter of which would be expected from a low inclination disk presenting a much smaller absorbing cross - section .",
    "we thus suggest that the targetted galaxies tend to have face - on inclinations , which is consistent with the observations of @xcite , who , from the azimuthal profiles of the  emission , suggest that the intervening galaxies could be highly inclined ( or highly asymmetric ) .",
    "one of the goals of current surveys for  21-cm absorption at various impact parameters is to determine the expected detection rate of cool , neutral gas in distant galaxies with the next generation of large radio telescopes .",
    "an important aspect of this is the determination of the expected detection rate of 21-cm absorption at redshifts where the detection of 21-cm emission will not be possible . here",
    "we demonstrate a clear anti - correlation between the integrated optical depth and the impact parameter , where previously only weak correlations were apparent at best ( significance levels of @xmath65 , @xcite ) .",
    "also , investigating the hypothesis that 21-cm absorption is more readily detected towards quasars in comparison to radio galaxies , we find that the statistics are insufficient to draw any conclusions .",
    "however , we do find that the mean detection occurs towards a radio source with a higher turnover frequency than a non - detection . since the turnover frequency is anti - correlated with source size ,",
    "this suggests that the coverage of the background emission is important and thus we would expect a higher detection rate towards quasars in comparison to radio galaxies .",
    "lastly , using the neutral hydrogen column density obtained from the 21-cm emission , we find no statistical evidence for a variation of the spin temperature ( degenerate with the covering factor ) over the inner @xmath66 kpc of the disk , similar to the consistency in spin temperature observed across the milky way @xcite . by using @xmath67 obtained from the  distribution of the milky way , the observed @xmath8@xmath9 correlation may suggest that the intervening galactic disks have high inclinations ( close to face - on ) .",
    "this is consistent with the  emission maps of @xcite , who suggest that galaxies which intercept background sources may be highly inclined .",
