    "the properties of the cluster galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) are still a matter of active debate . on the one hand considerable stress",
    "has been laid on a single analytic expression for the lf , as determined by schechter ( 1976 ) , which it is argued holds true for all clusters and the field ( e.g. abell 1975 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "much work has been concerned to establish differences in the lf as a function of cluster morphology .",
    "indeed , a universal lf is hard to explain theoretically .",
    "for example , according to the cannibalism line of argument ( e.g. hausman and ostriker 1978 ) , cd galaxies grow at the expense of other fainter galaxies - thus such a model predicts a deficit of bright galaxies in the most dynamically evolved clusters .",
    "the brightness of the 1st ranked cluster galaxy is thus related to the dynamical state of the cluster and the lf is expected to correlate with bautz - morgan ( b - m ) type , as this measures the contrast of the 1st ranked galaxy compared to the other bright galaxies .",
    "such a deficit in bright galaxies is also expected if tidal stripping in the outer halos of galaxies , due to interactions , is taking place ( richstone 1975 , 1976 ; merritt 1983 ; malumuth & richstone 1984 ) . only in the special case in which the luminosity function is determined during the formation period of the cluster , with little further dynamical evolution taking place , are no correlations of the lf with other cluster properties expected ( merritt 1984 , 1985 ) .",
    "the most popular approach taken to the study of the lf is to fit schechter s ( 1976 ) parameterized form , given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a normalization factor , @xmath6 is the power - law slope at the faint end , and @xmath12 ( or equivalently @xmath13 ) is the characteristic luminosity ( magnitude ) .",
    "schechter(1976 ) determined the best - fit parameter values to be @xmath14 ( j band ) and @xmath15 .",
    "in subsequent studies there has been claim and counter claim regarding the properties of this function . in a study of 12 very rich clusters , dressler ( 1978 ) concluded that @xmath5 does vary significantly from cluster to cluster and that it is correlated with the absolute magnitude of the first - ranked galaxy , in the sense consistent with the trend expected in the cannibalism model .",
    "lugger ( 1986 ) studied a sample of 9 abell clusters and concluded that while the mean values of @xmath13 and @xmath6 are in good agreement with those of dressler(1978 ) and schechter(1976 ) , there was no evidence for a correlation of @xmath13 with cluster morphology , central density or magnitude of the first - ranked galaxy .",
    "the examination of a further 14 rich clusters by colless ( 1989 ) , draws very much the same conclusions as lugger(1986 ) - with no variation in the cluster lfs with b - m type or richness seen .",
    "simulations suggest that variations of more than 0.4 mag in @xmath13 or 0.15 in @xmath6 are ruled out by these data .",
    "colless did find a marginally significant result such that the lf of the high velocity dispersion clusters has fainter @xmath13 compared with the low velocity cases .",
    "there are potential criticisms of these previous studies : first , as pointed out by lugger(1986 ) , the early studies such as that of dressler ( 1978 ) did not use a consistent cluster radius or limiting absolute magnitude in comparing different cluster lfs .",
    "secondly , the best previous studies ( those of dressler 1978 , lugger 1986 and colless 1989 ) confine their selection to abell clusters , and typically only the richer examples of these systems . since there are potential systematic biases in the way in which abell clusters were selected ( for example , cd dominated clusters are much easier to detect by eye ) ,",
    "these studies can not necessarily be held to be a true reflection of the properties of all clusters .",
    "last , previous studies have relied on global number counts to correct for the non - cluster background present , and have used counts often taken in different passbands and from different surveys .",
    "this can lead to systematic errors due to differences in the calibrations of the data the lf is derived from and the data the counts are taken from .",
    "here we have re - examined the lf afresh using a sample of 46 clusters , selected automatically from digitized data . as a result",
    "this study has certain advantages over previous work in the field .",
    "the clusters are selected from photometrically calibrated digitized scans of photographic plates using an automatic search algorithm .",
    "hence our data should be more uniform than the abell catalogue .",
    "the sample covers a wide range in richness and many of the clusters have well determined velocity dispersions , allowing us to test for variations in the lf as a function of intrinsic cluster properties .",
    "the sample of clusters used in this paper is drawn from the edinburgh / durham cluster catalogue ( hereafter edcc : lumsden et al .",
    "1992 ) , which in its turn is derived from the edinburgh / durham southern galaxy catalogue ( hereafter edsgc : eg heydon - dumbleton et al .  1989 ) .",
    "the edsgc consists of digitized cosmos scans of 60 uk schmidt telescope iii - aj survey plates centred on the south galactic pole , and is nominally 95% complete to @xmath16 with less than 10% contamination .",
    "a cluster sample was derived from the galaxy data in the edsgc as outlined in lumsden et al .",
    "there are over 700 potential clusters in the edcc , and this sample is the first published machine based cluster sample .",
    "the objective nature of the construction of the edcc implies that it does not suffer from the systematic subjective biases that appear in the southern extension of the abell catalogue covering the same area ( abell , corwin & olowin , 1989 ) .",
    "the edcc is complete within its selection criteria to a limiting magnitude for the tenth ranked cluster member of @xmath17 .    for a smaller sub - sample of the edcc clusters",
    ", we obtained redshifts with the multi - slit spectrograph efosc on the eso 3.6 m and with the multi - fibre spectrograph autofib at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the nature of this sample is discussed in nichol et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and guzzo et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and the redshifts are published in collins et al .",
    "approximately 10% of those clusters observed proved to have significant contamination from other groups along the line of sight at significantly different redshifts .",
    "we have excluded those clusters with ` projection effects ' as defined in collins et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from our sample .",
    "we note that the remaining clusters do not have a well defined cut - off in cluster richness ( unlike the sample of nichol et al ) , since we have included all the clusters for which we actually obtained redshifts .    from this dataset",
    ", we have excluded those clusters where the cluster background radius ( as defined in section 3.3 ) overlaps the boundaries of the edsgc for ease of computation , and those clusters where their respective abell radii are entirely superposed , since there is then no well defined cluster magnitude distribution .",
    "we also individually checked all the other clusters where the two clusters abell radii overlapped since the deblending procedure described in lumsden et al .",
    "can occasionally cause the derived cluster centroid to move away from the ` true ' position : we removed those clusters where the catalogue positions differed from both the centre derived from a visual inspection of the plate and the centroid of those galaxies for which we have redshifts by a significant fraction ( @xmath1830% ) of the abell radius . for blended clusters that pass this test , we assign galaxy membership to the individual clusters using the method described in lumsden et al .",
    "lastly , to be confident that we have removed all clusters that may have contaminating projection effects , we choose to use only those with a minimum of 4 cluster redshifts , and where the number of galaxies with redshifts outside of the cluster is less than the actual number of _ bona - fide _ cluster members .",
    "the parameters of the remaining 46 clusters ( as taken from lumsden et al .",
    "1992 and collins et al .",
    "1995 ) are given in table 1 .",
    "for all of the clusters , we have considered cluster members to be those galaxies within one abell radius ( where we have taken @xmath19mpc and we use the value for the hubble constant @xmath20 throughouth@xmath21 , and h@xmath22 is the hubble constant in units of km@xmath23s@xmath23mpc@xmath23 ] ) .",
    "our sample is the largest single database of clusters which has been used to study the lf to date .",
    "the edsgc was calibrated from photometric ccd sequences assuming that the plate and ccd magnitudes were linearly related ( heydon - dumbleton et al .",
    "however , for bright objects whose profiles are either strongly peaked ( such as elliptical galaxies ) or stellar , there is a regime in which the measured cosmos magnitude is less than the true magnitude , caused by lack of dynamic range within the measuring machine itself .",
    "this ` saturation ' occurs for elliptical galaxies at @xmath25 ( note that the plates themselves only saturate at much brighter magnitudes ) .",
    "fainter than this magnitude , and for most late type galaxies , the original calibration is correct , so that previously published results from the edsgc are unchanged by these corrections .",
    "however , since most clusters are dominated by elliptical galaxies at the bright end of the lf it is vital that we correct for this effect or else we will induce errors in the measured value of the ` break ' in the lf for the nearby clusters .    we have calculated a correction for this effect , by comparing the catalogued edsgc magnitude against the observed magnitude for 451 galaxies present in the ccd sequences used to calibrate the edsgc initially ( heydon - dumbleton et al ) . since for faint magnitudes",
    "the slope should be linear , but at bright magnitudes it should diverge from this , we used a quadratic fit to the data . from this",
    "we derive a fit with the form ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath26 @xmath27 this fit should be reliable in the range @xmath28 . for most of this range",
    ", the linear component present is actually the most important .",
    "this slope has been commented on previously by heydon - dumbleton ( 1989 ) , and gives rise to the observed slope in the fit at fainter magnitudes , and is a result of the definition of measured photographic magnitude used in the edsgc . as can be seen",
    "the effect is small ( the overall effect on the composite lf described in section 5.1 for example is 0.2 magnitudes ) .",
    "however , for the purposes of the lf , we include all terms , so that our magnitude scale is more closely matched to the ccd based magnitude scale .",
    "it should be noted that this correction is an average , and may not represent every cluster absolutely .",
    "since the saturation effect is a function of the photographic density , anything else that modifies this ( such as vignetting , emulsion flaws , plate fogging or emulsion desensitisation near the plate corners ) will consequently affect the amount of saturation present .",
    "we do not have sufficient ccd sequences to map these effects fully however , although we note that the overall photographic intensity ",
    "magnitude relation has been corrected for these effects ( see heydon - dumbleton 1989 ) .",
    "these effects may in part give rise to the observed scatter in fig .  1 .",
    "we expect the magnitude of any error caused by using this average calibration to be small , since the deviations from the fit are small .",
    "as is common with studies of the cluster galaxy luminosity function we use the standard schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) as the analytical model to our data .",
    "this function has the following form when expressed in terms of absolute magnitude : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the absolute magnitude , derived from the measured apparent magnitude @xmath33 using , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the k - correction suitable for the @xmath36 passband for the mix of galaxies typically observed in low redshift clusters ( ellis 1983 ) , and @xmath37 is the effective extinction in this passband .",
    "this latter quantity is derived using techniques described in nichol & collins ( 1993 ) for each cluster ( see also appendix a ) . in common with other studies of the luminosity function",
    "we assume that @xmath38 in deriving the distance modulus used , and we have adopted @xmath20 for simplicity as well .",
    "the lf normalisation @xmath39 is constrained using the actual observed number of cluster galaxies , and we carry out either a two parameter fit to @xmath5 ( the absolute magnitude of the ` break ' in the lf ) and @xmath6 ( the exponent of the power - law slope at fainter magnitudes ) , or a one parameter fit to @xmath5 with @xmath6 fixed where required .",
    "there are too few galaxies per bin in the individual lfs to fit both @xmath5 and @xmath6 simultaneously .",
    "since we wish to search for deviations from some ` mean ' lf , it is valuable to consider coadding all the lf data into an average or composite luminosity function , in a way that allows us to estimate both parameters simultaneously .",
    "the easiest manner in which to do this is to consider the composite luminosity function defined by colless ( 1989 ) to be @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ` richness ' of the @xmath42th cluster , @xmath43 is the number of clusters that actually contribute to the @xmath44th bin of the composite lf , @xmath45 is the background corrected number of galaxies in the @xmath44th bin of the @xmath42th cluster s lf and @xmath46 .",
    "we use a different definition of @xmath41 to that of colless , since he used the total number of galaxies brighter than @xmath47 and we use the background corrected number of cluster galaxies between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this is because our sample contains more distant clusters on average than the colless sample , and we would otherwise discard a significant fraction of the data as being objects where @xmath47 was beyond our chosen completeness limit .",
    "we also impose an upper limit in absolute magnitude when calculating the richness to avoid the problems with very bright galaxies discussed above . for typical values for the lf ( @xmath50 and @xmath15 ) , the relationship between our definition of richness and that of colless is @xmath41(colless)@xmath51(here ) .",
    "similarly , the errors for the composite lf are calculated according to @xmath52^{1/2},\\ ] ] where the @xmath53 are derived according to the error given in section 3.4 .      in order to derive the lf",
    ", we must be able to define the expected contribution from background galaxies , @xmath54 , accurately .",
    "we have considered three approaches to this problem .",
    "first , we used the counts in an annulus , centred on the cluster , with an inner radius of one degree and a width of one degree .",
    "this fixed radius was adopted for simplicity  using a fixed metric radius as opposed to a fixed angular radius gives essentially the same results .",
    "this method has the advantage that the correction is strictly local , and hence the variation in field counts seen in different regions of the edsgc is correctly accounted for . for the other two methods we used the the global counts as derived from the whole of the edsgc , and the average of the counts from the annuli from the first method described above .",
    "the first of these is similar to the procedure used in previous studies , but since our global counts actually come from the same data the lfs themselves are constructed from , we remove the possibility of errors arising from discrepancies in the calibration of the lf and the global counts .",
    "the second has the potential advantage that it excludes the rich clusters from the counts and hence is a better measure of the ` true ' background . in fig .",
    "2 we show the derived counts from the catalogue as a whole together with the average of the counts derived from the annuli around the clusters .",
    "there is essentially little difference between these _ on average_. the difference that does exist is at the level expected from the presence of real large - scale structure .",
    "there is little sign that excluding the rich clusters cores makes the background as calculated from the annuli lower than the global counts .",
    "previous estimates of the background count for use in the lf have been derived from either separate ` eye - ball ' galaxy catalogues ( e.g.  dressler 1978 , lugger 1986 ) or have been based on data from only very small areas ( colless 1989 ) .",
    "we note in passing that the slope of the number counts that we find is larger than that assumed in previous studies of the lf .",
    "this is however consistent with maddox et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , the only other measure of the counts over significantly large areas of the sky that is derived using a measuring machine .",
    "the fit given by colless ( 1989 ) appears to overcount the true background by @xmath55% .",
    "lastly , we note that the derived number counts shown in fig .",
    "2 drop off more rapidly than @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "this disagrees with other observations ( eg the deep ccd counts presented in metcalfe et al .",
    "1991 ) , and indicates that the overall completeness limit of the edsgc is @xmath58 .",
    "however , inspection of the number counts on individual schmidt plates also shows that this limit varies from plate to plate .",
    "we have allowed for a possible variable completeness with plate in our work by examining the number counts on each plate separately and assigning completeness limits relative to the 7 deepest fields in the survey . from this",
    "we find that the best plates are complete to @xmath59 and the worst to @xmath60 .",
    "we do not however use data fainter than @xmath16 from any field . for those fields where the adopted completeness limit is brighter than this",
    ", we do not use data fainter than that limit .",
    "in calculating the background correction required when using the global number counts we have interpolated the actual measured data , rather than fitting a single power law .",
    "the latter is a poor representation to the actual data , since the true number counts ` turn - over ' near @xmath61 ( eg metcalfe et al . ) .",
    "this regime is important for our work since for clusters with @xmath62 , @xmath16 is equivalent to an absolute magnitude of @xmath63 .",
    "we also have to derive suitable error estimates for these background counts .",
    "there are two sources of error , which are present in all the methods given above .",
    "the first is simply the poisson uncertainty in the counts and can be represented simply as @xmath64 .",
    "the second is systematic and represents the presence of large - scale clustering within the sample . for the global correction method , although we would assume that the slope of the background number counts is constant over the survey region , the normalisation of these counts changes with position .",
    "colless ( 1989 ) and lugger ( 1986 ) follow geller & beers ( 1982 ) in assuming that the background is only known to 50% . for the background derived from the local annuli we can estimate the error rather more accurately however .",
    "if we take all of these annuli , and find the scatter about the mean of the number counts , then we can derive the systematic error for this method .",
    "since all the annuli have the same area any number density deviations are purely due to the presence of large - scale structure .",
    "the derived variance is also shown on figure 2 .",
    "comparison of the expected contribution from poisson error and the total error observed indicates that the mean field - to - field variance is 25% for @xmath65 .",
    "the largest excursions seen are @xmath6650% over the same magnitude range .",
    "therefore , using the 50% variation in what follows , although conservative , does account for all the observed variations , whereas using the 25% mean variation is a better representation of the data as a whole but will underestimate the error in the background for a few clusters .",
    "we demonstrate in section 5.1 the effect of using this smaller error on the field counts compared to the value favoured by geller & beers .",
    "we note that dressler ( 1978 ) also found that a mean variation of 25% was a good fit to his data , and this result is compatible with the known angular clustering in the edsgc ( collins , nichol & lumsden 1992 ) .",
    "we have considered only a @xmath9 squared fitting method in deriving the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "if we let @xmath67 be the difference between the total counts in a bin and the expected background in the bin ( however the latter is calculated ) , so that @xmath68 then we seek to minimise the function @xmath69 where , @xmath70 and @xmath71^{1/2}.\\ ] ] throughout we use a bin width , @xmath72 , of 0.5 magnitudes .",
    "the presence of the second derivative in the form of @xmath73 takes account of the finite bin width used , since the number counts change extremely rapidly ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "the first term in the error represents the poissonian error in the total observed counts .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 .",
    "the second term must take account of both poissonian error and systematic errors in the background as noted in section 3.3 .",
    "this has the form @xmath75 , where @xmath76 ( except where explicitly noted that @xmath77 ) .",
    "although for many of the clusters data exists with @xmath32 brighter than @xmath1 and fainter than @xmath0 , there are good reasons for not using such data in deriving values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "first , for the fainter galaxies , the correction for the background becomes more difficult since the background fraction per bin rises steadily .",
    "for any given cluster we impose two limits on this : that any data with @xmath78 be discarded , for reasons outlined in section 3.3 , and that any bin for which the number of background galaxies exceeds the cluster galaxies also be discarded . in practice",
    ", the former limit essentially ensures the latter for faint galaxies in any event . for bright galaxies",
    "there are also problems we wish to avoid .",
    "it is desirable , as has been noted previously by , e.g. lugger , to exclude the brightest cluster galaxy when deriving the lf .",
    "we automatically do this since we discard all galaxies brighter than @xmath79 ( typically of order five galaxies in the richer clusters ) .",
    "there are more specific reasons for doing this in our case as well .",
    "first , the saturation correction is poorly defined brighter than @xmath80 , and hence the magnitudes of the galaxies brighter than this are likely to have larger errors . at @xmath81 ,",
    "this magnitude corresponds to @xmath82 , and at @xmath83 @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that galaxies brighter than @xmath79 should not be used because their photometry is suspect .",
    "secondly , cosmos data is deblended where object mergers occur ( cf the discussion in lumsden et al .",
    "1992 ) , but the accuracy of the magnitudes of the deblended data is less reliable than for single isolated objects . the brightest galaxies in clusters are almost always blended with fainter satellite systems in the edsgc data , so again the photometry of these objects is not reliable . discarding the brightest bins of the lf guards against problems of this kind .",
    "it is possible that similar problems may also be present in previous derivations of the lf , since the work described in the introduction also relied extensively on photographic plate material .",
    "in any event we recommend that results which rely on accurate magnitudes for the brightest galaxies in any lf derived from photographic plates should be treated with caution .",
    "we have also placed constraints on the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 that the fitting routine can accept , to prevent any possibility of the fitting process ` running away . '",
    "these limits are that @xmath5 should lie between @xmath0 and @xmath85 and that @xmath6 should lie between 0 and @xmath86 . therefore quoted values for the fits that are near",
    "these limits are indicative of a very shallow minimum in the fit , and hence that the reliability of the fit is likely to be low ( whatever the quoted formal probability that the fit is good ) .",
    "lastly , we note that we sum bins to ensure that there are @xmath87 galaxies per bin in the data being fitted , as is standard for @xmath9 minimisation techniques .",
    "before we can consider the actual data , we need some estimate of the reliability of our fitting procedure and the true error on these fits . to achieve this , we conducted extensive monte - carlo simulations .",
    "in particular , we carried out three sets of simulations : first , to estimate the effect that errors in the assumed background had on the fit parameters as a function of redshift ; secondly , to derive a measure of the true error distribution for a one parameter fit to a model lf as a function of richness , for @xmath41 typical of the single cluster values we found ; lastly , to derive the error distribution for the two parameter fits to the composite sets .",
    "these latter two will then allow us to estimate the true likelihood that observed departures from the composite lf are in fact truly significant .",
    "in carrying out these simulations , we have assumed that @xmath88 and @xmath15 for the model of the lf ( in accordance with the results derived in section 5.1 ) .    in order to check the effect of the background subtraction alone",
    ", we initially assumed that the form of the lf was known perfectly , and only the background was allowed to vary .",
    "we used the global background as derived above , and rescaled it at random so that the variance was 25% as was found to be the case in practise in section 3.3 .",
    "thus after normal background correction , the random lf would have either too many or too few background galaxies subtracted . by deriving fit parameters for many such datasets",
    "we can derive the average error induced in those parameters as a function of cluster richness and redshift .",
    "in general , for @xmath89 , the effect of errors in the background on the fit parameters is negligible , even for poor clusters . at higher redshifts , @xmath5 can be measured to an accuracy of 0.05 magnitudes if @xmath90 ( ie the average of the measured @xmath5 from the simulations is different by this amount from the assumed input @xmath5 ) . at @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the scatter in the derived value of @xmath5 becomes larger ( @xmath93 magnitudes ) .",
    "the values derived here should be the dominant source of error when the richness is very large ( since then the lf is known almost perfectly ) .",
    "since the composite luminosity functions given all have effective values of the richness that are much greater than 100 , it is clear that the empirically derived errors for the effect of different background corrections given in section 5.1 are in good agreement with the results of these monte - carlo simulations .",
    "more generally , we need to map out true estimates of the likely scatter in the fits to @xmath5 when the lf was drawn at random from the same model lf used above . in this case , since we draw individual galaxies at random from the parent lf , we also include random fluctuations in the lf itself .",
    "for low to moderate richness clusters , it is these fluctuations that dominate the scatter in the fits to @xmath5 rather than the background correction method .",
    "although the resultant values are therefore independent of redshift , we have adopted @xmath83 as typical of our clusters , in order to include a suitable background contribution .",
    "this background is derived in the same manner as described above .",
    "table 2 gives the limits outside of which 90% , 31.5% , 10% , 5% and 1% of the data lie .",
    "one of the most noticeable features of these simulations is that the distribution of fitted values for @xmath5 is skew , with a strong tail towards brighter magnitudes .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure 3 , where we present the distribution of fits to @xmath5 for two richnesses , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this trend is due to the restricted range of absolute magnitudes that are actually used to fit against .",
    "since we set m@xmath96 in accordance with the result we find in section 5.1 , there are only two bins in the fitted lf that actually sample the break . at low richness values",
    "there are often insufficient counts per bin to truly define this break , and hence , since there is no constraint from the actual data , the fitted value of @xmath5 can take quite large negative values without changing the @xmath9 of the fit significantly . in practice ,",
    "the limit for @xmath5 at the bright end is set by our constraint that @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , for the richer sample shown in figure 3 the trend towards a strongly skewed distribution is much less evident as expected .",
    "this skewness also shows in the mean @xmath5 derived from the simulations , with this value being the input value of @xmath98 at large richness but diverging to @xmath99 at @xmath94 .",
    "this same behaviour is also demonstrated ( in a slightly different fashion ) by the simulations of colless ( 1989 ) , where he shows that the probability that a two - sample @xmath9 test can reject the possibility that two clusters are drawn from the same underlying population is also skew with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "we can further confirm the reason for this skewed distribution , by looking at the distribution of @xmath5 when the absolute magnitude range being fitted is @xmath100 to @xmath0 .",
    "the results for @xmath101 are given in table 2 and also shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is easy to see the effect that including the brighter galaxies has on fixing the location of the break in the lf .",
    "the slight skewness left in the distribution now reflects the fact that the total number of galaxies with @xmath102 in these low richness systems is rather few .",
    "the derived error bounds including these bright galaxies are most similar to those for a much higher value of @xmath41 ( @xmath103 ) when fitted over the normal range in @xmath32 .",
    "the key result of these simulations therefore is that it is difficult to rule against overly bright values of @xmath5 as being from the same distribution as the composite .",
    "however , those clusters for which @xmath5 is rather fainter than the composite are strongly discriminated against .",
    "we note that the results of these simulations can also be applied to the data of colless ( 1989 ) , and that the simulations of dressler ( 1978 ) are not applicable to the case of fitting over a restricted magnitude range ( or rather that the dressler results would be closer to those achieved in practice but for a much larger true richness ) .",
    "it is worth also considering how sensitive these results are to our assumed value of @xmath6 .",
    "we tested this using @xmath104 for @xmath105 , typical of our sample .",
    "we found that the changes are small ( @xmath106 in the faint limit on @xmath5 , and @xmath107 in the faint bright limit ) and always act to push these limits _",
    "brighter_. since the cluster lfs we can exclude are those which have faint @xmath5 , it is clear that adopting a lower value of @xmath6 will only make this difference larger .",
    "the formal average of our composites using all methods of calculating them give @xmath108 ( table 3 ) .",
    "this implies that the probability that any lf agrees with the derived composite as given by the simulations is slightly conservative .    since we have carried out two parameter fits in section 5.1 and 5.3 , we also need to know the likely joint distribution of @xmath6 and @xmath5 for the case of rich systems alone ( ie composite lfs ) .",
    "we therefore carried out simulations as described above but in this case applied a two parameter fit to the lf . in this instance",
    "the best way to present the data is graphically , and the results of the simulations are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the contour levels plotted correspond to the same probabilities given for the one parameter case in table 2 , except that we exclude the contour that contains 10% of the data in this instance .",
    "the simulations have been binned into 0.05 in @xmath6 and 0.1 in @xmath5 for presentation .",
    "it is clear from figure 4 that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are highly correlated . in",
    "what follows we will present formal error estimates on each fit , derived by determining the value(s ) at which @xmath109 . as will be seen",
    ", there is a considerable difference between these formal errors and both the error distributions given in table 2 for the one parameter fits and the distribution shown in figure 4 for the two parameter fits .",
    "this difference largely stems from the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , since the errors in these are also therefore clearly correlated .",
    "these formal errors are included for completeness only ( since they do provide a measure of ` goodness - of - fit ' ) .",
    "we will only use the monte - carlo simulations and two - sample @xmath9 tests when assessing the true deviations that may be present between any given lf and a universal composite .",
    "the first lf we consider is the composite of all the clusters which have @xmath110 .",
    "there are 23 clusters in this sample , and the richness of the composite was found to be @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this allows us to compare our results with previous samples which generally dealt with rich abell clusters .    for this composite",
    "we have considered the effect of using the different background correction methods outlined in section 3.3 , as well as for the different assumed errors in that background subtraction .",
    "the results of the fitting process for these different background corrections are given in table 3 and shown in figure 5 .",
    "the first three rows were derived by fitting both @xmath5 and @xmath6 to this sample over the magnitude range ( @xmath113 ) with an assumed field - to - field error in the background counts of 50% .",
    "the first entry gives the results for the local correction method , the second for the global correction using all of the counts and the third the global correction but using only the average of the annuli around the clusters .",
    "clearly the two global background corrections we have used give essentially the same result . directly comparing the data derived from the local and global background correction methods using a 2-sample @xmath9 test also shows that these composites are in good agreement for the absolute magnitude range given above ( @xmath11499% probability they are same ) .",
    "moreover , since we have not renormalised the lfs before comparing using this test , this also indicates that differences that do exist between the background subtraction methods for individual clusters ( as will be shown in section 5.2 ) tend to average out when combined in the composite .",
    "the last three rows in table 3 give the equivalent results when the field - to - field background error is assumed to be 25% as noted in section 3.3 .",
    "this change therefore gives the same results as before within the derived errors on @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the global correction method , and only very slightly different in the formal sense for the local correction method .",
    "this shows that the dominant error in deriving estimates of @xmath5 or @xmath6 is actually the poissonian contribution ( cf the discussion after equation 4 ) , and that the variation due to assuming a different error on the background term alone is small .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of these changes found here is negligible compared to the expected measurement errors as shown in section 4 .",
    "henceforth , we consider only the 50% field - to - field variation , since it adequately represents all of the clusters in the present sample .",
    "lastly , it is worth noting the effect that changing the magnitude range over which the fits are made has on these conclusions . including the brighter galaxies pushes @xmath5 brighter . including the fainter galaxies makes a slight difference to the slope but little else .",
    "it should be noted however that only one cluster actually contributes for @xmath32 fainter than @xmath0 , whereas all 23 clusters contribute at @xmath32 brighter than @xmath1 .",
    "the result derived when the fit is over the range @xmath115 , using the local background correction , is also given in table 3 .",
    "the low probability that the fit is good is due to the fact that a schechter function is now a poor fit to the data at both bright _ and _ faint magnitudes .",
    "we note that a similar ( though larger ) increase in brightness of @xmath5 was found by lugger when she considered mean luminosity functions with the brightest cluster galaxies included .",
    "however , we repeat our caution of section 2.2 that data on such bright galaxies ( @xmath116 ) can not be relied upon absolutely because of problems of saturation and image blending ( cf the discussion in colless 1989 ) .",
    "it is also not clear therefore whether or not the greater variance from the mean seen in the brightest bins , as compared to those in the more restricted absolute magnitude range over which we normally determine the lf , is actually real or merely an artifact of the cosmos measurements .",
    "we also fitted each cluster lf separately to the schechter function , but this time holding @xmath6 constant ( since there are insufficient points in many of the clusters to enable more than a one parameter fit to be made successfully ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath15 as an appropriate compromise , based both on our own results and those previously published .",
    "table 4 shows the results of these tests for all 46 clusters that were found to have positive values of @xmath41 and figure 6 shows the actual data for those with @xmath117 .",
    "we quote results derived using both the global and local background correction methods .",
    "we also tested for differences arising from the choice of background subtraction method by comparing the lf distributions directly .",
    "we used a two - sample @xmath9 test to check for differences between the two sets of lfs , without rescaling the lfs for the possibility that the two background subtraction methods may have resulted in a different overall normalisation .",
    "we have allowed for the fact that the adopted magnitude completion limit may be brighter than @xmath118 , so that we compare the lfs in the range @xmath1 to the brighter of @xmath0 or the plate completion limit .",
    "these limits are given in table 4 .",
    "the results of the two - sample @xmath9 test are given in column 10 of table 4 .",
    "as can be seen the agreement is good , and even for the worst case ( e748 ) , we can not rule out the possibility that the two samples represent the same underlying distribution .",
    "we also compared the single cluster lfs with a suitably normalised model of the composite ( assuming the average values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 found above ) , using a simple @xmath9 test ( given in table 4 ) , and with the results of the monte - carlo simulations from table 2 .",
    "it can be seen that there are several clusters where the lf derived using global background subtraction is a poor match to the model , but the lf derived using the local background is a much better fit .",
    "we take this as evidence for the fact that assuming an overall global background will not be a good match to every cluster .",
    "generally the two tests give similar results , though we note that the two - sample @xmath9 test is considerably more conservative at ruling out individual lfs , as expected .",
    "however , all those lfs for which the two - sample @xmath9 test gives a probability below 20% , are also found to be a poor match to the composite from the simulations .",
    "there are two exceptions to the corollary however : both e438 and e462 have unexceptional probabilities from the two - sample @xmath9 test , but are excluded at the 5% level from the simulations .",
    "if we include only those clusters where the derived @xmath5 lies outside the 1% confidence level from the simulations ( as taken from table 2 ) for one or other of the background subtraction methods , then only clusters e400 , e429 and e524 show strong evidence for an lf that differs from the composite .",
    "all three of these clusters also disagree at the 5% level when considering both background subtraction methods . at the 5% level",
    ", there are several additional clusters that disagree .",
    "leaving aside those where only one of the background subtraction methods gives divergent results ( e499 , e726 ) , we are left with e438 , e462 and e742 .",
    "all of these , except e400 and e429 , have a value of @xmath119 , so we may reasonably exclude these as being different on the grounds that accurate background subtraction is crucial for these clusters , and , as found in section 4 , errors of 0.5 magnitudes in the fitted value of @xmath5 are easily accounted for by an inappropriate background correction .",
    "this leaves only e400 and e429 .",
    "it can be seen from table 4 that even the direct @xmath9 comparison of their lfs with the composite might lead to them being thought discrepant .",
    "the lfs of these clusters are apparently normal ( see figure 6 ) . however , before concluding that these clusters do show a significant difference , we first consider the possibility that there may be some problem with the data .",
    "examination of the data in collins et al .",
    "( 1995 ) shows that all of these clusters have good reliable redshifts , with the positions of the galaxies for which redshifts were obtained agreeing well with the cluster centres given in table 1 .",
    "further , we note that for the cases of e400 and e429 , other clusters appear on the same photographic plate and do not have discrepant @xmath5 , hence the photometry of these systems should be good .",
    "therefore , we find that there are at least two clusters that do not have the same lf as the derived composite .",
    "this is in keeping with earlier studies by dressler ( 1978 ) , lugger ( 1986 ) and colless ( 1989 ) who found that @xmath1810% of their clusters similarly did not agree with the mean schechter lf they derived .",
    "the major advantage of our sample over previous studies is that it is large enough that we can test the dependence of the lf on intrinsic cluster properties .",
    "in particular , we will consider the possible variations with cluster richness ( as defined by @xmath41 ) , bautz - morgan class , which we have taken from the abell , corwin & olowin catalogue , and velocity dispersion ( taken from collins et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "for each case we split our total sample into two , and used the local background correction method only . when comparing different richness samples we used the cuts @xmath120 and @xmath110 ( which is of course just the composite lf derived previously ) . for bautz - morgan class ,",
    "we considered only those of type i and iii , and counted intermediate types ( e.g.  type i - ii ) as type ii which we did not use . in this way we sought to maximise the differences between the clusters to test for any effect on the lf .",
    "we split the sample into two in velocity dispersion using a cut at 700kms@xmath23 .",
    "unfortunately , most of the very high velocity dispersion clusters ( those with @xmath121kms@xmath23 ) are also the most distant , making it difficult to constrain @xmath6 , and leaving few bins in the data to compare the 2 sets using a @xmath9 test .",
    "we therefore were forced to use a lower velocity cut - off for our high velocity dispersion sample than colless ( 1989 ) did , so do not sample the same part of parameter space as he did .",
    "since we do not have well defined velocity dispersions for all clusters , and those which are not in the abell , corwin & olowin catalogue do not have bautz - morgan classes , the two subsamples do not comprise all of the observed clusters .",
    "the number of clusters comprising each subsample is given in table 5 .",
    "in addition , for the velocity dispersion and bautz - morgan samples we have included two richness cuts , at @xmath110 and @xmath122 .",
    "this provides some indication of the stability of the result on the clusters making up the actual subsamples .",
    "we give both one and two parameter fits to the schechter lf in table 5 . for the one parameter",
    "fits we again used @xmath123 .",
    "the results from this analysis are also shown in figure 7 .",
    "we have also compared the lfs for these subsamples against the composite derived in section 5.1 , and against each other , using a two - sample @xmath9 test , as well as comparing the subsamples directly with the results of our simulations ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the results of the two - sample @xmath9 test are also given in table 5 .",
    "since @xmath39 can vary between these different sets of clusters , we rescaled the binned data before the comparison , so that the derived @xmath124 values from the composites agreed",
    ".    there are noticeable differences between the richness cuts for both the bautz - morgan class iii clusters and the high velocity dispersion clusters , with the richer subsamples having a notably poorer fit to the standard schechter lf , and being discrepant compared to the composite .",
    "however , only one cluster contributes to the faintest bin in the richer subsample , and only one other is added to that when the poorer limit is considered .",
    "if we exclude this bin , then very similar fits are found for both richness limits and the discrepancy is removed .",
    "it is clear from this that variations in the lf due to the last bin alone are not significant .",
    "we do not consider these two subsamples further .",
    "once these discrepant sets are removed , it is clear that neither bautz - morgan class shows any evidence for deviation from a universal lf , nor do they differ from each other , according to any of the tests applied . the same is true for the split according to richness alone , where the fits to both samples are very similar within the derived errors .",
    "the actual ` goodness ' of the fit for the lowest richness sample is poor , but this most likely reflects difficulties in background correction at these low richness values as noted previously .    for the @xmath122 velocity dispersion samples , there is weak evidence that the two samples differ from each other ( significance @xmath125% ) . when compared with the composite , neither sample shows any evidence for difference when using the two - sample @xmath9 test .",
    "however , when compared with the monte - carlo simulations , we find that the higher velocity dispersion clusters are clearly unlikely to have been drawn from the same basic distribution as the composite ( at much better than the 1% level ) .",
    "we therefore find that there may be evidence for some dependence of the lf on velocity dispersion .",
    "it is worth considering the effect of including the brighter galaxies as well in this analysis .",
    "as is readily evident from figure 7 , there is little difference between the rich and poor samples across the entire range of @xmath32 , and the differences for the high and low velocity dispersion samples is largely restricted to the fainter galaxies .",
    "considering the @xmath122 bautz - morgan samples however , there are clearly fewer bright galaxies in the bautz - morgan class i sample than in the bautz - morgan class iii sample .",
    "this is not a normalisation effect since the two samples have essentially the same lfs at fainter magnitudes .",
    "again however , we caution against overinterpretation of this difference .",
    "lastly , we note that all of the velocity dispersion subsets , and the low richness subset can formally be excluded as being drawn from a model of the composite lf with @xmath6 fixed at @xmath7 on the basis of the one parameter fits",
    ". small deviations in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 mean that the one parameter fits are distinct from the composite derived in section 5.1 .",
    "it is clearly dangerous to compare such subsamples ( with their relatively small intrinsic errors ) using such methods .",
    "first , we compare our derived estimates for the composite lf , for all clusters with @xmath110 , with those derived previously .",
    "colless ( 1989 ) gives the best fits from previous data in his table 2 , scaled into the colour and value of @xmath126 that we are using .",
    "excluding colless own data this shows that the quoted values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively , with typical errors in @xmath5 of 0.5 , when the brightest cluster galaxies are excluded from the fit .",
    "colless himself finds @xmath129 and @xmath130 for a two parameter fit similar to ours .",
    "these values are in good agreement within the errors with those derived by us .",
    "it is clear that the luminosity functions of moderately rich clusters , when considered across this relatively narrow range in absolute magnitude , are indeed very similar on average .",
    "in addition we can compare our one parameter fits for 3 clusters with those given by colless ( 1989 ) .",
    "edcc clusters 394 , 400 and 124 correspond to his clusters c02 , c03 and c52 . from table 4",
    "we can see that when a comparison is made of similar fitting procedures ( ie , @xmath9 fitting and using a global background correction ) , the agreement is excellent .",
    "colless quotes values for @xmath5 of @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for c02 , c03 and c52 respectively .",
    "although the original photographic plates used in both studies are the same , a different measuring machine was used ( the apm ) , with consequent differences in the reduction from measuring machine magnitudes to final derived astronomical magnitudes . therefore , this agreement for the specific clusters that are common to the two studies is highly encouraging .",
    "it is worth making some specific comments on these clusters however .",
    "e394 was found by colless to be discrepant with both the fit by a schechter lf and with a comparison with his composite lf .",
    "we note that table 4 shows that whilst the global background correction gives a moderate probability for both the fit and the comparison with the composite , the local background correction method gives better agreement .",
    "this difference shows in the direct comparison of the magnitude distributions for the two background correction methods ( table 4 ) .",
    "this is clearly an example where global background correction gives rise to these deviations .",
    "we note that e394 is one of the poorest clusters in both our sample and that of colless .",
    "colless found that e124 was marginally discrepant when compared against the composite lf .",
    "we find no evidence for any difference .",
    "lastly , e400 , which we found in section 5.2 to be potentially significantly different from the composite , colless finds to be a reasonable match .",
    "however , since this cluster gives a difference for both background subtraction methods , we find our result to be reliable .",
    "we also note that the smaller errors derived for by us for both e400 and e124 allow us to make more definitive statements than colless can for these clusters .",
    "finally we note that unlike colless , we find that all the subsets of the data we took are well fit by a one parameter schechter lf , though they are not necessarily in agreement with the fit to the composite .",
    "there have been few detailed n - body simulations of the formation of clusters that have suitable dynamic range to map out the whole of the expected lf as a function of the cosmological model assumed .",
    "for example , van kampen ( 1995 ) makes simple predictions for the lf based on extensive simulations , but is led to the conclusion that his modelling can not correctly account for all of the merging that takes place within the cluster .",
    "his fit to the bright end of the luminosity function ( which we might expect to be easier to model ) is similar to the one observed .",
    "there have been studies that lead to simpler predictions as to the expected form of the lf according to the dominant processes that occur during cluster formation .",
    "the mode of cannabalism for the growth of cd galaxies as suggested by hausman & ostriker ( 1978 ) predicts that there should be differences between the luminosity function when broken down by bautz - morgan class .",
    "we see no real evidence for such a difference when we consider the range @xmath134 .",
    "there is an indication for such a trend in the galaxies brighter than @xmath79 , in the sense that the bautz - morgan class i sample has fewer bright galaxies .",
    "however , better photometry of the bright galaxies would be required to confirm this result .",
    "merritt ( 1983,1984 ) argued that most of the properties of clusters are essentially ` frozen in ' when they form and that merging and tidal stripping processes are ineffective in rich cluster cores .",
    "this leads to the prediction that the lf should appear to be much the same from cluster to cluster . however , hst imaging data of moderate redshift clusters ( e.g.  dressler et al .",
    "1994 ) tends to rule against such a model , since it provides convincing evidence that mergers are important at least in the early stages of cluster evolution .",
    "one possibility is that the bulk of the change in the lf between clusters occurs only amongst the very faintest or brightest galaxies , the regime to which our data is insensitive .",
    "for example , it is known that some clusters show an upturn in the lf at faint magnitudes ( e.g.  driver et al .",
    "1994 , bernstein et al .  1995 ) , and there has always been marginal evidence for greater deviations in the lf when the brightest cluster galaxies are included ( e.g.  lugger 1986 and the comments in section 5.1 ) , though we again caution against over - interpretation of results on the brightest cluster members .",
    "however , our data clearly shows that in the region of the ` break ' in the lf , the cluster - to - cluster variance is extremely small .",
    "we have considered the cluster galaxy luminosity function as derived from data in the edinburgh - durham southern galaxy catalogue and the edinburgh - milano redshift survey .",
    "our dataset is the largest multi - redshift cluster sample to be considered to date for this purpose . from this",
    "we find :    1 .",
    "our data shows that there is strong evidence that _ most _ clusters have very similar lfs when both the brightest and faintest galaxies are discarded .",
    "the average of the composite lfs derived using the 3 background correction methods in section 5.1 give @xmath135 and @xmath4 , when the lf is determined in the range @xmath134 .",
    "we find a very good agreement between our results and those derived by colless ( 1989 ) from similar input data , and with the mean of the data presented by dressler ( 1978 ) and lugger ( 1986 ) .",
    "we have tested the stability of the derived schechter luminosity function parameters to the type of background correction made .",
    "we find excellent agreement between a method based on a global background correction and that based on a strictly local correction .",
    "however , the largest systematic error remaining in our derivation of the best fit parameters for the composite lfs is the background correction , with an uncertainty of up to 0.05 in @xmath5 and 0.05 in @xmath6 possible .",
    "we also tested the universality of the luminosity function , by comparing individual cluster lfs with the composite function derived in section 5.1 , and by testing each cluster lf separately against a schechter function ( section 5.2 ) . from this",
    "we find that at most @xmath1810% of the clusters may have lfs that are significantly different from the composite .",
    "we also broke our sample into sub - samples defined by richness , bautz - morgan class and velocity dispersion ( section 5.3 ) . from these tests we found weak evidence that the high and low velocity dispersion samples have different composite lfs , and that the higher velocity dispersion clusters may have a different lf to the global composite .",
    "this agrees with the marginal detection of a difference between similar samples by colless ( 1989 ) .",
    "we also found evidence for differences between the bautz - morgan class samples , but only for the brightest galaxies ( @xmath102 ) that we otherwise excluded for reasons of photometric reliability ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "the trend evident is in line with the predictions of the cannabalism model of hausman & ostriker ( 1978 ) , but we caution against over - interpretation of this result without more reliable photometry for the bright galaxies .",
    "there is no evidence for any convincing difference between the other subsets of the data . our results , and our simulations ,",
    "do however show that it is important to consider more than one method of testing the difference between subsets of the data . on the basis of a one parameter fit alone",
    "we would have concluded that there were significant differences between the low and high velocity dispersion samples and the composite , and between the low and high richness clusters .",
    "the other tests show no evidence for any difference however , with the exception of the high velocity dispersion clusters where the two parameter fits , and monte - carlo simulations show weak evidence for a difference from the composite .",
    "it is likely that to make any further progress on the nature of the cluster galaxy luminosity function we will need to overcome the limitations of data such as ours .",
    "first , there is clearly a need to derive cluster membership free of any correction for backgrounds , by obtaining sufficient redshifts that we can actually map the galaxy distribution in three dimensions around the cluster .",
    "secondly , better photometry is required to tie down the bright and faint ends of the lf . given these it should be possible to not only discriminate between differences in the data broken down by richness , velocity dispersion or whatever else is desired , but also to test for the differences that our data suggest may exist in the lf when comparing the very brightest and very faintest galaxies .",

    "<S> we further show that fitting only a single parameter schechter function to composite subsets of the data can give erroneous results for the derived @xmath5 , as might be expected from the known tight correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by considering two parameter fits </S>",
