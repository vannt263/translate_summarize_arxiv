    "also , anti - nuclei have been observed in nucleus - nucleus and proton - proton collisions by experiments at the rhic @xcite and lhc accelerators @xcite . the star collaboration at rhic reported in march 2011 that the anti - he4 nuclei were identified in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the alice collaboration at lhc confirmed the star results in may 2011 .",
    "an experimental study of anti - nuclei requires a knowledge of anti - nucleus interaction cross sections with matter .",
    "the cross sections are needed to estimate various experimental corrections , especially those due to particle losses which reduce the detected rate . in practice ,",
    "various phenomenological approaches are applied in order to estimate the antinucleus - nucleus cross sections .",
    "thus , a first task is a creation of reliable estimations of the cross sections .",
    "here we use the glauber approach .",
    "it is obvious that an annihilation can take place at an interaction of an anti - nucleus with a nucleus .",
    "a lot of mesons can be produced in this way .",
    "thus , we have to simulate the meson production .",
    "we do this in the framework of the quark - gluon string model .",

    "the first calculations of the cross sections of anti - deuteron interactions with nuclei in the eikonal approximation were presented by buck et al .",

    "the fourier - bessel transform of the function gives the elastic scattering amplitude in the momentum representation .",
    "we use analytical expressions for an expansion of the transform presented in ( @xcite ) to calculate differential elastic antinucleus - nucleus cross sections .",
    "calculations of the total , inelastic and elastic cross - sections of of an anti - nucleus interactions with nuclei allow to be determined a point where the anti - nucleus penetrating through a matter will interact .",
    "the main channel of the antinucleon - nucleon interactions at low energies is the annihilation into 3 , 4 , or 5 mesons .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the reaction is going through the re - arangement of quarks and anti - quarks in the colliding particles , see fig .",

    ", the reaction will result in a three quark - gluon string creation .        if a quark and an antiquark annihilate ( fig .",

    "such a string must fragment into a final state containing a baryon and an anti - baryon .",

    "the ordinary quark - antiquark string can fragment at least into two mesons , and it can be responsible for the reactions with two final state mesons .",
    "a hybrid meson with hidden baryon number can be produced in process `` d '' at low energies .",
