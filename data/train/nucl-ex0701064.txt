    "the antiparticle to particle ratios of hadrons are important observables of heavy ion collisions , and have been extensively studied since the very beginning of rhic operations @xcite .",
    "they are more precisely measurable than invariant cross sections , and provide quantitative input to models concentrating on the hadro - chemistry of the collisions , such as statistical thermal models .",
    "antiproton to proton ratios and net proton yields provide information on baryon transport and baryon production in these ultra - relativistic collisions , and are relevant quantities to estimate the fraction of the total collision energy that is available for particle production @xcite .",
    "the presented identified hadron spectra at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev extend the energy range for which the contributions of different particle species to the inclusive charged hadron spectra are known , bridging a gap between 17.2 and 130 gev .",
    "invariant cross sections at very low @xmath2 , net proton yields and baryon enhancement in the intermediate @xmath2 range ( reported earlier in @xcite ) are studied in au+au collisions at 62.4 gev .",
    "the sensors in the two arms of the phobos silicon spectrometer are arranged into layers @xcite .",
    "the particles with @xmath2 measured to be less than 200 mev / c range out in these layers .",
    "particle ratios are measured in the @xmath3 gev / c range in the spectrometer , and the identified spectra analysis uses the time - of - flight detector as well , extending the @xmath2 reach to 3 gev / c .",
    "the acceptance corrections of the particle ratios are cancelled by changing the polarity of the magnetic field : the ratios are formed from the yields of the positive and negative particles with similar trajectories corresponding to the same bending direction , but to opposite magnetic polarity .",
    "ratios in each bending direction and spectrometer arm are evaluated separately and averaged , at the same time providing a handle on the systematic errors .",
    "the ratios are corrected for absorption in the beam - pipe and in the detector materials , secondary particle production and feed - down from weak decays , based on detailed monte carlo simulations .",
    "the size of the latter correction is only 1 - 2% , since the first silicon layer is positioned within 10  cm from the interaction point , thus allowing good rejection of tracks from displaced vertices .",

    "the comparison of different collision energies ( left panel ) shows that the @xmath1 ratios are strongly energy dependent in cu+cu collisions ( similarly to collisions of heavier ions ) .",
    "there is only an insignificantly small , if any , decrease of the @xmath1 ratio observed with increasing collision centrality at both energies . on the right panel , the same ratios in p+p , cu+cu and au+au collisions are compared at 200 gev , where again , almost no variation of the @xmath1 ratio with centrality is visible .",
    "this observation challenges theoretical expectations about baryon stopping in collisions with varying impact parameter .",
    "these comparisons are being extended to 62.4 gev where the ratios are further away from unity , possibly leaving more room for measurable variations .    in order to be able to study the ratios of different particle yields or @xmath2 integrated @xmath6 rapidity densities",

    "different rows correspond to three classes of centrality ( expressed as the percentile of the total inelastic au+au cross section , starting with the 15% most central collisions in the top row ) . a smooth evolution of the spectra with centrality can be observed , with the proton spectrum being harder than the meson spectra , similar to results at higher collision energies @xcite .",

    "the net proton yield is approximately proportional to @xmath10 , which does not meet expectations of increasing amount of baryon stopping with increasing centrality .",
    "according to figure  [ ratios ] , the @xmath1 ratio does not depend strongly on centrality , thus the @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields are also proportional to @xmath10 to a good approximation .",

    "the abundance of produced pions is naturally low compared to high collision energies , while baryon number conservation ensures that a significant fraction of the large number of initial state protons are found in the final state , thus the invariant yields of protons and positive pions become comparable already at low @xmath2 . with increasing energy , this @xmath2 value grows , mainly due to the approximately logarithmically increasing number of produced pions .",
