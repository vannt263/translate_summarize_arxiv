    "in this paper we study two problems :    \\1 . how to include the running coupling qcd constant in the bfkl equation @xcite ;    \\2 .",
    "the contributions to the solution of the bfkl equation which originate from infrared and ultraviolet renormalons .    to demonstrate",
    "why these two problems are important for the low x physics , we review the main points of our strategy in perturbative qcd approach . we start with perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in the kinematic region where the parton density and coupling qcd constant ( @xmath7 ) are small . each physical observable ( i.e. gluon structure function ) can be written in pqcd as following series : [ perser ] xg(x , q^2)=_n = 0 c_n ( _ s)^n(l^n + a_n - 1 l^n - 1 ... a_0 ) , .",
    "this perturbative series has two big problems :    * 1 . *",
    "the natural small parameter @xmath7 is compensated by large log ( l ) .",
    "the value of l depends on the process and kinematic region .",
    "for example in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 of course it is not the full list of scales . the only that we would like to emphasize that @xmath12 depends on the kinematic region .",
    "thus to calculate @xmath13 one can not calculate only the born approximation , but has to calculate a huge number of feynman diagrams .    * 2 . *",
    "@xmath14 means that we are dealing with an asymptotic series and we do not know the general rules of what to do with such series .",
    "there is only one rule , namely to find the analytic function which has the same perturbative series . sometimes but very rarely we can find such analytic function .",
    "for this case , this is the exact solution of our problem .",
    "however , the general approach has been developed based on leading log approximation ( lla ) .",
    "the idea is simple .",
    "let us find the analytic function that sums the series : [ lla ] xg(x , q^2)_lla=_n=0 c_n ( _ s l ) ^n .",
    "usually we can write the equation for function @xmath15 .",
    "the most famous one , the glap evolution equation @xcite , sums eq.(2 ) if @xmath12= @xmath16 .",
    "however , it turns out that for the region of small @xmath17 the most important is so called the bfkl @xcite equation .",
    "it gives the answer for eq.(2 ) in the case when @xmath12=@xmath18 .",
    "using the solution of the lla equation we build the ratio : r(x , q^2)==_n=0 r^n= _",
    "n=0 c_n(l^n-1 + a_n-1l^n - 2 + ... a_0 ) .",
    "this ratio is also asymptotic series , however here we calculate this series term by term .",
    "our hope is that the value of the next term will be smaller then the previous one @xmath19 for sufficiently large @xmath20 .",
    "however , we know that at some value of @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the only thing that we can say about such situation in general , is that our calculation has intrinsic theoretical accuracy , and the result of calculation should be presented in the form r(x , q^2)=^n = n-1_n=0 r_n r_n .",
    "the size of @xmath23 depends mostly on how well we chose the lla , and how well we established the value of scale @xmath12 in the process of interest .    in the region of small",
    "x the natural value of the scale @xmath12 is @xmath24 and the series of eq .",
    "(  [ lla ] ) can be summed by the bfkl equation .",
    "we have reached substantial understanding of the main properties of this equation during the last two decades ( see ref.@xcite ) . the last major advance in such understanding",
    "was made by a.mueller @xcite who introduced the correct degrees of freedom - colour dipoles , in terms of which the bfkl equation got the partonic - like probabilistic interpretation ( see also related papers @xcite ) .",
    "however one problem with the bfkl equation is still open , namely we do not know how to include the running qcd coupling constant in it .",
    "there are two aspects of the problem .",
    "the first one is of the fundamental importance .",
    "indeed , only the bfkl equation with running coupling constant can turn into the glap equation at large value of virtualities @xmath25 .",
    "we discuss this issue in the next section .",
    "the second aspect is more practical one .",
    "the first attempts to take into account the running coupling constant ( @xmath26 ) in the bfkl equation @xcite show that the behaviour of the solution at low x which is power - like ( @xmath27 ) becomes much slower ( the value of @xmath28 is significantly lower ) than for the original version of the bfkl equation with fixed @xmath29 . in section 2",
    "we will generalize the bfkl equation for the case of running @xmath29 .",
    "the question arises : can we guarantee the accuracy of the bfkl equation with running @xmath29 knowing that the calculation even the correction of the order of @xmath29 to the bfkl equation is a very difficult task , which to date has not been performed even by the great experts in the field @xcite . to answer this question",
    ", we have to discuss the second problem in the perturbative series , namely the @xmath30 rise of coefficients @xmath31 ( see eq .  [ perser ] ) .",
    "by now we have known three sources of the @xmath30 behaviour of @xmath32 : infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalons which are intimately related to the running @xmath29 and instanton contribution . in this paper",
    "we concentrate our efforts on the first two , because the instantons at high energy give negligible contribution ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for relevant discussion ) .",
    "the @xmath30 behaviour of @xmath32 from ir and uv renormalons originate from running @xmath29 and real parameter which governs the inclusion of @xmath29 is @xmath33 .    in section 3 ,",
    "we study the first correction to the bfkl equation due to running @xmath29 in detail , and show three principle results .",
    "the first one is that we can absorb all uncertainties related to the contribution of the ir renormalons , which have basically nonperturbative origin , to the shadowing correction ( sc ) to the total cross section .",
    "it should be stressed that those sc can be expressed through the correlation length between two gluons , which can not be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "the second result is the fact that we can guarantee the accuracy of the bfkl equation with running @xmath29 summing all terms of the order @xmath34 in the series of eq .",
    "(  [ perser ] ) .",
    "the third result is the nonperturbative contribution of the order of @xmath35 from ultraviolet renormalons which does not appear in the wilson operator expansion .    in section 4",
    "we are going to discuss the solution to the bfkl equation with running @xmath29 .",
    "we start with the numerical estimates of the first correction to the value of @xmath36 due to running @xmath29 .",
    "we formulate our numerical accuracy in the attempts to solve the bfkl equation with running @xmath29 and find the green function for it .",
    "we show that running @xmath29 leads to a smaller value of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , than the original bfkl equation with fixed @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we discuss the bfkl equation @xcite with running @xmath29 , but start with the original version of this equation with fixed @xmath29 , both for the sake of completeness of the presentation and to clarify the main steps in the derivation of the bfkl equation .",
    "it should be mentioned that we will follow the original derivation of the bfkl equation in the momentum representation since we found it more economic to include the running @xmath29 than the mueller approach @xcite .",
    "we firmly believe that it could also be duplicated in dipole picture , but leave this job for further publication .",
    "the bfkl equation was derived in so called leading log ( 1/x ) approximation , in which we would like to keep the contribution of the order of @xmath38 and neglect all other contributions , even of the order of @xmath39 .",
    "so the set of parameters in ll(1/x)a is obvious : @xmath40 log < 1 ; @xmath41 let us consider the simplest process : the quark - quark scattering at high energy at zero momentum transfer .",
    "all problems of infrared divergency in such a process is irrelevant since they are canceled in the scattering of two colourless hadrons ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    in the born approximation the only diagram of fig .",
    "2.1 contributes to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude ( a ) .",
    "it is easy to understand that the result of calculation of this diagram gives : [ ba ] 2 = | m ( 2 2 ; | s , t = - k^2_t ) |^2 = s , where @xmath42 denotes the amplitude in the lowest order of @xmath29 for quark - quark scattering at transfer momentum @xmath43 through one gluon exchange ( see fig.2.1 ) , n is the number of colours and @xmath44",
    ". one can recognize the low - nussinov mechanism @xcite of high energy interaction in this simple example .    in the next order we have to consider a larger number of the diagrams , but we can write down the answer in the following general form : [ neba ] 2 = @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is coupling constant of qcd ( @xmath48 ) ; @xmath49 is the amplitude for the production of the extra gluon in the born approximation , and is given by the set of feynman diagram in fig.2.2 while @xmath50 is the amplitude of the elastic scattering in the next to leading born approximation ( see fig .",
    "2.3 ) at the momentum transfer @xmath51 .",
    "two terms in have different physical meaning : the first one describes the emission of the additional gluon in the final state of our reaction , while the second term is the virtual correction to the born approximation due to the emission of the additional gluon .",
    "it corresponds to the same two particle final state , and describes the fact that due to emission the probability to detect this final state becomes smaller ( we will see later that the sign of the second term is negative ) .    in the both terms of we",
    "can integrate over @xmath52 as well as over the longitudinal component of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . finally , we rewrite the phase space in the following way : @xmath55 [ ps ] ( 2 ) ^4 ^(4 ) ( * p_1 + p_1 - p_1 - p_2*)^ i = 2_i = 1 = ; where @xmath17 is the fraction of the longitudinal momentum carried by particle .",
    "the value of @xmath56 depends on the reaction .",
    "for example in the deeply inelastic scattering @xmath57 . in the case of the quark scattering @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the transverse mass of produced quark",
    ".    from one can see the origin of the @xmath60 contribution : it stems from the phase space integration , if @xmath61 does not go to zero at @xmath62 . to sum the diagrams of fig .",
    "2.2 in this limit we can use two tricks .",
    "the first one is for each @xmath63- channel gluon one can rewrite the numerator of the gluon propagator at high energy in the following way : [ gluon ] g_=+ o ( ) the second trick is based on the gauge invariance of the qcd .",
    "we look on the subset of the diagrams of fig .",
    "2.2 pictured in fig .",
    "2.4 as the amplitude of the interaction of gluon @xmath64 with the quark @xmath65 ( see fig.2.4 ) .",
    "since all particles in amplitude @xmath66 except gluon @xmath67 are on the mass shell , the gauge invariance leads to the relationship : [ gaugetrick ] k _ m _ = 0 . using sudakov variables",
    "@xcite we can expand vector @xmath67 as @xmath68 and rewrite in the form : [ gatr ] @xmath69m_=0 .",
    "we note that all particle inside @xmath66 have a large component of their momentum on @xmath65 .",
    "it means that we can neglect the projection of vector @xmath70 on @xmath71 , or in other words @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus we can conclude from that [ trpo ] p_1 m_=- . using both tricks of and",
    "one can easily see that only diagram of fig .",
    "2.4 ( 1 ) contributes in ll(log(1/x)a .",
    "indeed , let us consider for example the diagram of fig .",
    "2.4 ( 2 ) , the dominator of the quark propagator @xmath74 is equal to @xmath75 since due to the polarization of gluon @xmath67 is transverse we can not compensate the smallness this diagram at @xmath76 . using the same tricks with the upper parts of the diagrams of fig .",
    "2.2 we arrive at the conclusion that that the set of the diagrams of fig .",
    "2.2 degenerates into one diagram of fig . 2.5 with specific vertex for gluon emission : [ vertex ] _ = igf_a",
    "b c _ , where @xmath77 is given by the usual feynman rules for qcd .",
    "substituting into the first term of we get the contribution of the emission of one additional gluon to the next to born approximation in the form : [ eminba ] = s ^y_0 d y k_emission ( k_t , k_t ) , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the kernel @xmath80 is equal to [ kernem ] k_emission ( k_t , k_t)= .    to calculate the virtual correction in the next to born approximation ( @xmath81 ) we have to estimate the contribution of the set of diagrams of fig . 2.3 . the log ( 1/x )",
    "contribution is hidden in the real part of the amplitude @xmath81 , and easiest way to extract this log is to use the dispersion relation : [ disre ] m(22;^2)= \\ { ds + du}. we calculate @xmath82 and @xmath83 using unitarity ( see ): [ unitarity ] _",
    "s = @xmath84 the difference between and is that the born amplitude for one gluon exchange enters these two equations at different values of momentum transferred @xmath63 .",
    "the explicit calculations give : [ renba ] _",
    "s = sc_s ( k^2_t ) ; @xmath85 @xmath86 using the dispersion relation of one can reconstruct the real part of the amplitude and the answer is [ re ] = s ( c_u - c_s ) ( k^2_t ) log s the colour coefficients have a very famous relation between them ( see fig .",
    "2.6 ) which gives , for the difference of the colour coefficients in the same colour structure as for the diagram of fig . 2.3 ( 3 ) .",
    "thus @xmath87 has the same colour structure as one gluon exchange in the born approximation .",
    "this fact makes it possible to rewrite the second term in as the correction to the gluon trajectory , e.g. instead of gluon with propagator @xmath88 we can introduce the new propagator [ regge ] s^^g ( k^2 ) @xmath89 k'^2_t}\\ ] ] the answer for the second term in can be written in the form [ virtual ] = s @xmath902 .",
    "we can get the full answer for the amplitude in the next to the born approximation ( @xmath91 by summing and and it can be written in the form : [ finnba ] = s^y_0 d y k ( k_t , k_t ) where @xmath92 and [ liker ] k ( k_t , k_t ) = - . using",

    "the first part of the kernel @xmath97 describes the emission of new gluon , but with the vertex which differs from the vertex in the feynman diagram , while the second one is related to the reggeization of all t - channel gluons in the `` ladder '' .",

    "therefore , the bfkl equation is basically not perturbative and the worse thing , is that we have not yet learned what kind of assumption about the confinement has been made in the bfkl equation .",
