    "gromov s paper deals with connections of _ alexandrov  fenchel type inequalities _ and the _ brunn  minkowski inequality _",

    "the _ brunn  minkowski inequality _ for two compact convex subsets @xmath1 asserts that their minkowski sum @xmath2 satisfies @xmath3 for bounded convex subsets @xmath4 and a multiindex @xmath5 , the _ mixed volumes _ @xmath6 : = [ y_1^{j_1 } , \\ldots , y_k^{j_k}]$ ] are defined by the coefficients of the homogeneous polynomial @xmath7 , \\qquad   b_j : = \\frac{n!}{j_1 ! \\cdots j_k!},\\ ] ] on @xmath8 .",
    "the _ alexandrov  fenchel theorem for convex sets _ asserts that , for @xmath9 ( the set of all multiindices of degree @xmath10 in @xmath11 ) the corresponding mixed volumes @xmath6 $ ] define a function @xmath12 $ ] which is concave on every `` discrete line '' parallel to the edges .    in @xcite these inequalities",
    "are transferred to compact khler manifolds , where one obtains the following _ brunn  minkowski inequality for khler manifolds _ ( theorem  [ thm : iv.12 ] ) : let @xmath13 be compact @xmath14-dimensional khler manifolds and @xmath15 be a compact connected complex submanifold of complex dimension @xmath14 and @xmath16 the projection of @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 here one has equality for @xmath20 . replacing the khler manifolds @xmath18 by projective spaces and @xmath17 by an irreducible projective variety",
    ", the inequality remains valid . for @xmath21",
    "this is the hodge index theorem @xcite , and for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , this inequality is due to hovanskii and tessier @xcite .",
    "the central point of @xcite is to establish connections between the following three contexts :    * convex sets , * convex functions , and * khler structures    these connections are so tight that they permit us to translate certain theorems such as the brunn  minkowski inequality which originally belongs to ( a ) to the areas ( b ) and ( c ) . the passage from ( a ) to ( b )",
    "is based on legendre and laplace tranforms and representing convex sets as the image of the differential of a convex function ( fenchel s convexity theorem  [ thm : i.7 ] ) .",
    "the passage from ( b ) to ( c ) is based on khler potentials on tube domains @xmath24 and the quotients @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an open convex subset , and the corresponding hamiltonian actions of @xmath0 , respectively the torus @xmath27 , obtained from translations in the imaginary direction .",
    "finally , the passage from ( c ) back to ( a ) is established by momentum maps for hamiltonian @xmath28-actions on toric varieties ( which correspond to the case @xmath29 ) and their convexity properties as developed in @xcite for compact manifolds and for non - compact manifolds and proper momentum maps in @xcite . for a generalization from abelian to real reductive groups and corresponding gradient maps ,",
    ".    tn the first three sections we describe these three translation mechanisms . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we turn to gromov s results and explain how the brunn  minkowski inequality is transferred to ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "eventually we explain how it fits into a broader context also including a version of the alexandrov  fenchel inequality in ( c ) .",
    "the emphasis of this note lies rather on the techniques from various mathematical areas involved than on the final results contained in @xcite .",
    "this note does not contain new results , but we hope that it supplies useful details in a reasonably self - contained fashion and shed some additional light on how convex geometry interacts with khler geometry .    after we wrote the first version of these notes in 1993 , they were a starting point for chapter v on convex sets and functions in the monograph @xcite .",
    "so we added references to this book in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "we also added a last section on related subjects and more recent developments in this area .",
    "the work in @xcite was also very much inspired by @xcite .",
    "it constitutes an extension of the connections between ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) to the context of non - compact non - abelian lie groups .",
