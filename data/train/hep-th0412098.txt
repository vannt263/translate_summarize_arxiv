    "in 1971 , f. calogero @xcite introduced a solvable quantum model describing a system of @xmath1 particles with two - body interactions depending on the inverse square of the particles distance . in the same year , b. sutherland @xcite proposed a similar model with an interaction potential of trigonometric type .",
    "the importance of these models , which was already apparent from the very beginning , is now widely acknowledged by the theoretical and mathematical physics community . from a mathematical point of view , these models are integrable both in their classical and quantum versions , in the sense that they admit a complete set of integrals of motion",
    ". moreover , they are also exactly solvable , in the sense that their spectrum and eigenfunctions can be expressed in closed form . from a more physical point of view , calogero  sutherland ( cs ) models play an important role in many different fields , like for instance yang  mills theories  @xcite , the quantum hall effect  @xcite , random matrices  @xcite and fractional statistics  @xcite .",
    "calogero  sutherland models were cast into a very elegant mathematical framework by olshanetski and perelomov in @xcite .",
    "they showed that these models are limiting cases of a more general one with a two - body interaction potential of elliptic type , and uncovered their relation to the @xmath2 root system .",
    "in fact , these authors also constructed generalizations of the previous models associated with all the classical ( extended ) root systems , like @xmath0 .",
    "the extension of cs models to particles with internal degrees ( typically interpreted as spin ) of freedom was first proposed in the classical case in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the quantum case ,",
    "spin cs models were actively studied in the last decade , both in the @xmath2 and @xmath0 cases .",
    "it turns out that these models inherit the basic properties of their scalar counterparts , namely their integrability and exact - solvability .",
    "there are essentially two approaches in the study of spin cs models , namely the supersymmetric formalism  @xcite and the dunkl or exchange operator method  @xcite . usually , but not always  @xcite , the interaction of the spins with a constant external magnetic field is not included in the spin cs hamiltonian .",
    "in 1988 , haldane @xcite and shastry @xcite independently introduced a new type of solvable spin chain with long - range position - dependent interactions .",
    "the sites of this chain are equidistant points in a circle , and the interaction between the corresponding spins is proportional to the inverse square of their chord distance . shortly afterwards , fowler and minahan @xcite showed that this chain is completely integrable by means of polychronakos s exchange operator formalism @xcite .",
    "the connection with the sutherland model , although already noted by shastry in his paper , was made precise by polychronakos in @xcite , using what he called the  freezing trick \" .",
    "the main idea behind this method , which can actually be applied to any spin cs model , is to take the strong coupling constant limit in the hamiltonian , so that the particles become  frozen \" at the equilibrium positions of the scalar part of the potential .",
    "in this way one can obtain new spin chains of haldane  shastry ( hs ) type , in which the sites are not necessarily equally spaced .",
    "most of the literature on hs spin chains is devoted to those based on dynamical spin models of @xmath2 type , while their @xmath0 counterparts have received comparatively less attention .",
    "yamamoto and tsuchiya proved the integrability of the rational hs chain of @xmath0 type @xcite , although they did not compute its spectrum .",
    "the trigonometric @xmath0 spin chain was discussed by bernard , pasquier and serban @xcite in the spin @xmath3 ferromagnetic case , but only for equally spaced sites .",
    "the integrability of the trigonometric / hyperbolic version of this chain was established in @xcite , although again its spectrum was not computed . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we have extensively studied the trigonometric @xmath0 spin chains ( both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ) for arbitrary spin and without assuming that the sites are equally spaced .",
    "the main result in the latter paper is the derivation of a closed - form expression for the partition function of the model , following a method based on polychronakos s freezing trick .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of the presence of a constant external magnetic field in the trigonometric @xmath0 sutherland model for spin @xmath3 and in its associated spin chain .",
    "this modifies the hamiltonian of the spin chain by the addition of a term proportional to the projection of the total spin operator along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that both the dynamical spin model ( if the magnetic field is suitably oriented ) and its associated chain remain solvable , although the method used in @xcite to compute the spectrum of the dynamical model , based on expressing the hamiltonian in terms of a commuting family of dunkl operators , can not be applied in this case .",
    "we shall see , however , that the basis of the hilbert space constructed in the latter reference to solve the model in the absence of a magnetic field can be slightly modified so that the hamiltonian of the dynamical model is still triangular . from the spectrum of the dynamical model",
    "we shall then evaluate in closed form the partition function of its associated spin chain using the freezing trick .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the dynamical spin model and its corresponding hilbert space .",
    "the spectrum of this model is computed in section  3 , by showing that the term due to the magnetic field is triangular in an appropriate modification of the basis constructed in  @xcite . in section  4 we define the hs spin chain and compute its partition function using the freezing trick and the results of the previous section .",
    "in this section we set up the notation used throughout the paper and define the hamiltonian of the sutherland spin model of @xmath0 type in the presence of a constant external magnetic field .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath4 the hilbert space corresponding to the internal degrees of freedom of @xmath1 identical spin @xmath5 particles .",
    "let @xmath6 be a basis of @xmath4 whose elements are simultaneous eigenstates of the @xmath7 component of the one - particle spin operators , @xmath8 being an arbitrary direction .",
    "the corresponding spin permutation and reversal operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined by @xmath11 we will also use the customary notation @xmath12 .",
    "the operators @xmath10 and @xmath9 generate a multiplicative group isomorphic to the weyl group of @xmath13 type .",
    "similarly , the coordinate permutation and sign - reversal operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the total permutation and sign reversal operators will be denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the multiplicative group generated by @xmath15 and @xmath14 ( respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) is also isomorphic to the @xmath13-type weyl group .",
    "let us define the antisymmetrizer with respect to the symmetric group generated by @xmath21 as @xmath22 @xmath23 being an element of this group and @xmath24 its signature .",
    "likewise , we will denote by @xmath25 the symmetrization ( @xmath26 ) or antisymmetrization ( @xmath27 ) with respect to sign reversals . here and in what follows all sums and products run from 1 to @xmath1 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we shall make use of the projection operator @xmath28 on states antisymmetric under particle permutations and with parity @xmath29 under sign - reversals .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin sutherland model of @xmath0 type in a constant external magnetic field @xmath30 is given by @xmath31\\\\    & { } + b\\,\\sum_i \\sin^{-2}\\!x_i\\,(b-{\\epsilon}s_i)+b'\\,\\sum_i    \\cos^{-2}\\!x_i\\,\\big(b'-{\\epsilon}s_i\\big)\\\\    & { } -eg\\,{\\boldsymbol{{\\mathfrak b}}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol\\sigma}+\\frac{e^2}4({{\\mathfrak b}}_y^2+{{\\mathfrak b}}_z^2)\\sum_ix_i^2\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the total spin operator and ( @xmath33 is an arbitrary system of orthogonal axes .",
    "here we have assumed that the real constants @xmath34 are greater than @xmath5 , and we have denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath36 the particles gyromagnetic ratio and electric charge , respectively .",
    "the last ( diamagnetic ) term in eq .   has to be dropped to preserve the solvability of @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , this term vanishes identically if the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath38 axis .",
    "since our main interest is to study the spin chain associated with the hamiltonian @xmath37 , we have preferred in what follows to drop the diamagnetic term in order to keep the direction of the magnetic field in the spin chain arbitrary .",
    "the above hamiltonian possesses inverse - square type singularities for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "since the nature of these singularities prevents the particles from overtaking each other and from crossing the singular hyperplanes @xmath40 , the particles may be regarded as distinguishable , with configuration space @xmath42 the hilbert space of the system can thus be taken as @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the conditions imposed in the definition of @xmath45 guarantee the finiteness of @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "it can be shown that the operator @xmath48 is actually equivalent to any of its extensions to spaces of symmetric or antisymmetric functions ( with respect to both permutations and sign reversals ) in @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the @xmath1-cube @xmath51 and @xmath52 is defined similarly to @xmath45 . for technical reasons ,",
    "it is convenient to consider that @xmath37 acts in the hilbert space @xmath53 of states antisymmetric under permutations and with parity @xmath29 under sign reversals .",
    "the hamiltonian   with @xmath54 was thoroughly studied in @xcite , and its spectrum was exactly computed .",
    "the calculation was based on the fact that when @xmath54 the hamiltonian is the image of the operator @xmath55\\\\    & { } + b\\,\\sum_i \\sin^{-2}\\!x_i\\,(b - k_i)+b'\\,\\sum_i    \\cos^{-2}\\!x_i\\,\\big(b'-k_i\\big ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the mapping ( cf .",

    "@xcite can not be directly applied to prove its integrability , since it is not clear how to express the operator @xmath79 in terms of a commuting family of differential - difference operators . moreover , even if the new term proportional to the magnetic field leaves invariant the spaces @xmath65 , the matrix of @xmath79 in the basis @xmath68 of @xmath67 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite need not be triangular .",
    "it is more convenient , therefore , to work directly with the spin hamiltonian   and its representation in a slight modification of the spin basis @xmath69 used in the latter reference .",
