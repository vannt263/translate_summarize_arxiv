    ".[t : e2 ] electric quadrupole ( e2 ) clock transition . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another option is to use the ir@xmath3 ions .",
    "clock transitions in these ions involve hole states in the @xmath4 subshell which leads to extra enhancement of the sensitivity of clock frequencies to variation of the fine structure constant  @xcite .",
    "a diagram for few lowest states of ir@xmath3 is presented on fig .",
    "[ f : ir17 ] .",
    "the energies and sensitivety coefficients for clock states of ir@xmath3 ions are presented in table  [ t : ir17 ] .",
    "note , that the ion has two clock transitions which have different sensitivity to variation of @xmath8 .",
    "if the ratio of two frequencies is measured , the combined sensitivity is very large @xmath15 experimental work with ir@xmath3 ions is in progress at max planck institute  @xcite .",
    "it has been mentioned above that we are looking for systems with large sensitivity coefficients @xmath16 and clock frequency @xmath17 beeing in optical region so that the enhancement factor @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is large due to large @xmath16 rather than small @xmath17 .",
    "the largest sensitivity factors found so far are in the cf@xmath3 and cf@xmath7 ions  @xcite .",
    "however , both these ions are not very convenient for the use as atomic clocks .",
    "the cf@xmath3 ion has only one optical transition other than clock transition .",
    "this is a magnetic dipole transition between ground @xmath20 state and excited @xmath21 state .",
    "it is weak due to small frequency of the transition .",
    "this makes it difficult working with the ion .",
    "the cf@xmath7 ion has only one metastable excited state which can serve as a clock state .",
    "the transition between ground @xmath22 and metastable @xmath23 states is the magnetic octupole ( m3 ) transition .",
    "it is so weak that its use as clock transition is very problematic .",
    "it turns out that good clock transitions exist in the cf@xmath6 ion as well as in the es@xmath7 and es@xmath3 ions .",
    "the main parameters of the ions and corresponding clock transitions are summarized in table  [ t : cfes ] .",
    "note that both elements have only unstable isotopes . however , many isotopes have very long lifetime ( see , e.g. table  [ t : cfes ] ) .",
    "the choice of isotopes in table  [ t : cfes ] is dictated by two considerations .",
    "first , it is a long - living isotope .",
    "second , nuclear spin @xmath24 has such a value that it is always possible to have @xmath25 , @xmath26 for both states in the clock transition . here",
    "@xmath27 is the total angular momentiom of the ion and @xmath28 is its projection .",
    "states with @xmath25 and @xmath26 have zero quadrupole moment and are not sensitive to gradients of electric field .",
    "the authors are gratefull to h. katori and m. wada for useful discussions .",

    "<S> further progress can be achieved by using optical transitions in hci  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hci are less sensitive to perturbations due to thier compact size . therefore , quality factor @xmath13 can be larger than in neutral atoms due to smaller @xmath14 . in this paper </S>",
