    "the laser source was a linearly - polarized , single wavelength ( @xmath45 633 nm ) helium - neon laser ( melles griot ) with a power of @xmath46 10 mw which was expanded and collimated by a telescope ( @xmath47 = 15 mm and @xmath48 = 125 mm ) to approximate a plane wave . the plane wave illuminated a holoeye pluto spatial light modulator ( slm ) ( @xmath49 pixels ) which has a resolution of 8 @xmath50 m and was calibrated for a wavelength of 633 nm .",
    "the slm was addressed with holograms representing durnin s ring - slit aperture encoded via amplitude modulation ( see supplementary information ) .",

    "the @xmath60 objective also acted as an aperture to select only the first diffraction order which was captured on a ccd camera ( point grey fire - wire ccd ) .    * petal position . * to extract the petal position from the captured camera images , the measured bessel beams were compared to simulated beams with the same number of petals , which were adapted in spatial scale .",
    "the comparison was achieved in a quantitative manner by evaluating a two - dimensional cross - correlation coefficient when rotating the simulated patterns with respect to the measured beam .",
    "the correct angular rotation of the measured beam was found from a maximum of the correlation function . to avoid ambiguities in the form of a multiple number of correlation maxima ,",
    "the simulated pattern was rotated within the interval of 0@xmath61 to 180@xmath62 .",
    "the fidelity of the process was improved by iteratively refining the interval limits until a chosen accuracy was achieved , which was 0.1@xmath61 in the experiments .",

    "the power of the petal and ring region was determined , and normalized to the respective total power @xmath65 : @xmath66 which is necessary due to the limited definition region of the bessel beams ( see supplementary information ) .",

    "each of the two parts of the intensity pattern given in equation  ( [ definte ] ) rotates with a varying rotation rate .",
    "when one rotates faster , the other rotates slower .",
    "since the rotation rates are inversely proportional to their respective overall intensities , the one that rotates slow is always brighter than the other one , which rotates fast .",
    "the fact that the two respective terms in equation ( [ definte ] ) have varying overall power , implies that they exchange power during propagation . to understand this exchange we use the intensity transport equation @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the phase of the optical field .",

    "<S> the image insets show the beam profile at a distance of @xmath36 mm ( a position at which maximum angular deviation from the linear case is observed ) for the four plotted @xmath14 values , with the angular rotation of the petals given as white text . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the morphology parameter , @xmath14 , acts as a tuning parameter that determines the degree of non - linearity , and therefore also the angular velocity of the rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be shown to be    @xmath37    from which we may immediately find the angular acceleration :    @xmath38 ^ 2}. \\label{accrate}\\ ] ]    these new relations have been confirmed experimentally , with results shown in * figure [ accelerate ] * for @xmath21 and @xmath3 . as the field propagates in the positive @xmath19 direction , so the petal pattern rotates . </S>",
    "<S> the angular velocity of this rotation changes during propagation according to equation ( [ rotrate ] ) , following an oscillatory evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this is evident in * figures [ accelerate ] ( a ) * and * ( b ) * for @xmath21 and @xmath3 beams , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity changes rapidly as the beam propagates , speeding up and slowing down , reaching very high angular velocities .     and @xmath3 , respectively , while the resultant angular acceleration for these respective examples is shown in ( c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured data ( circles ) is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions ( solid curve ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this changing angular velocity implies an angular acceleration , the origin of which resides in the phase structure of the superposition field . as the angular velocity is oscillatory , </S>",
    "<S> so the beam experiences both acceleration and deceleration during propagation </S>",
    "<S> . a plot of this can be seen in * figures [ accelerate ] ( c ) * and * ( d ) * for the @xmath21 and @xmath3 helicities . the magnitude of the angular velocity and angular acceleration is affected by both the helicity of the beams in the superposition ( @xmath7 ) as well as the difference in their phase velocities ( @xmath39 ) , following equations ( [ rotrate ] ) and ( [ accrate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tuning ( morphology ) parameter , @xmath14 , determines if the field will accelerate at all , and to what extent . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of rotating fields can be deduced by setting @xmath35 ; the petals rotate at a constant angular velocity given by @xmath40 since equation  ( [ ncu ] ) reduces to a superposition of two oam fields with linear azimuthal phase variation . </S>",
    "<S> such fields , _ sans _ acceleration , have been studied in detail previously@xcite and represent only a special case of the more general accelerating light described here .     </S>",
    "<S> ( red ) , @xmath41 ( black ) , @xmath42 ( green ) and @xmath4 ( blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the measured maximum fractional energy exchange as a function of @xmath14 , and ( c ) beam snapshots ( unnormalised ) over a complete cycle at distances of approximately @xmath43 and @xmath44 mm . </S>",
    "<S> all data is for the @xmath3 case . ]    up to this point our analysis has been restricted to the rotation of the petal structure . </S>",
    "<S> a new and interesting feature of these angular accelerating beams becomes evident during propagation when the entire field is considered : the central petal structure appears to gain and lose energy in a manner that is directly coupled to the acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> when the inner petal structure is accelerating , energy is transferred out of this region of the field , whereas when it is decelerating energy is transferred back into the petal structure . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> a fast rotating field appears dim , while a slow rotating field appears bright . </S>",
    "<S> this exchange is measured and plotted in * figures [ energy ] ( a ) * and * ( b ) * , with the raw beam data over one cycle shown in * figure [ energy ] ( c)*. we have analysed this problem theoretically ( see supplementary information ) and find that the energy is transported radially during propagation due to the fact that the entire field is not rotating at the same rate . indeed , while our prior analysis pertains to the central region of the field ( petals ) , the outer region is also rotating but exactly out of phase with the inner region . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the angular accelerations are inversely proportional to their @xmath19-dependent intensity modulations , so that the two regions exchange energy and alternate in brightness during propagation . </S>",
    "<S> a fast rotation in one part of the field is accompanied by a slow rotation in the other part . in summary , each of the two parts of the intensity pattern rotates with a varying rotation rate . </S>",
    "<S> when one rotates faster , the other rotates slower . since the rotation rates are inversely proportional to their respective overall intensities , the one that rotates slow is always brighter than the other one , which rotates fast </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplementary movies ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we point out that we have implemented the concept with bessel beams for convenience only : bessel beams may have their phase velocities engineered by the radius of a ring - slit programmed on a spatial light modulator . in principle </S>",
    "<S> _ any _ field that satisfies the requirements outlined here will result in angular acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> our treatment may be generalised further to create helicon beams @xcite that accelerate by not fixing the superpositions to equal but opposite helicities . </S>",
    "<S> while many studies have considered rotating light created by a myriad of techniques , none have demonstrated controlled angular acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> such fields will have obvious applications in the optical control of micro - particles @xcite and may even be extended to the non - optical domain @xcite and non - linear propagation @xcite to explore new physical processes .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have outlined a new concept for the angular acceleration of light and demonstrated it experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> our approach makes use of superpositions of oam fields created with digital holograms . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that these angular accelerating fields may be tuned continuously in their acceleration with the aid of a single morphology parameter . </S>",
    "<S> these fields have advantageous features that overcome previous disadvantages of transversely accelerating light : their feature sizes are not dictated by the degree of acceleration , the angular extent of the acceleration does not influence the paraxial nature of the field ( the entire azimuthal plane can be used ) and they can be engineered to extend over arbitrarily long distances . given the interest and applications of transversely accelerating light , one can envisage many uses for this new class of angular accelerating light , for example , in driving flow of opto - fluidic systems and accelerating matter waves studies . </S>"
