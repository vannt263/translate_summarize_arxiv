    "a kiloparsec - scale jet in m  87 , the giant elliptical radio galaxy in virgo cluster  the very first extragalactic jet ever discovered @xcite  provides us with an exceptional laboratory for studying physics of relativistic collimated outflows .",
    "this is because its proximity ( @xmath3 mpc , 1 arcsec = 78 pc ) allows for observations of the jet and of ambient medium at different frequencies , with a very high spatial resolution .",
    "this jet has in fact been studied in great detail in all wavelengths .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of this jet is the inner hst-1 knot region , observed at about 60 pc from the active core @xcite .",
    "complexity of this innermost part of the outflow , which consists of stationary _ and _ superluminal sub - components , as well as its uniquely variable broad - band emission , calls for an explanation . here",
    "we investigate the properties of hst-1 knot and present an attempt to provide such an explanation .    below we summarize observational constraints on the physics of the m  87 jet in general .",
    "next , in section 2 , we investigate properties of the ambient medium necessary for understanding the dynamics of the jet .",
    "we argue that the enhanced thermal pressure connected with a stellar cusp in the innermost parts of the host galaxy is likely to form a stationary converging / diverging reconfinement / reflected shock structure in the jet . in section 3 ,",
    "we conclude that indeed the stationary and flaring upstream edge of hst-1 knot can be associated with the decelerated portion of the jet matter placed immediately downstream from the point where the reconfinement shock reaches the jet axis .",
    "the presented interpretation gives us a framework in which one can model the broad - band emission of this part of the jet , and its high energy @xmath0-ray emission in particular . in section 4",
    ", we present an evaluation of the radiation fields at the position of hst-1 knot .",
    "we find that the energy density of the starlight and of the nuclear emission can be comparable to the energy density of the equipartition magnetic field in this jet region .",
    "this means that the high energy @xmath0-ray inverse - compton emission of hst-1 knot s flaring point should be expected at the ( very roughly ) similar level as its observed radio - to - x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "since the latter one has recently increased significantly up to @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 @xcite , the expected tev flux from hst-1 knot should then be promisingly comparable to the one detected from the m  87 system @xcite .",
    "this issue is investigated further in section 5 .",
    "there we present a possible scenario relating variable emission of the hst-1 knot / reconfinement nozzle with a modulated activity of the relativistic central core .",
    "in particular , we show that assuming the previous epoch of the high nuclear activity of a central black hole , resulting in ejection of excess particles and photons down along the jet , one may expect first a high - energy flare of hst-1 due to inverse - compton scattering of the nuclear radiation , followed a few years later by an increase in the synchrotron continuum emission of this region .",
    "interestingly , the predicted @xmath0-ray fluxes ( assuming energy equipartition between radiating electrons and the jet magnetic field ) are consistent with the observed ones .",
    "final summary and conclusions from our study are presented in the last section 6 .",

    "observations reported by @xcite show a presence of a very broad radio - emitting limb - brightened outflow close ( @xmath6 parsec ) to the m  87 center , characterized by an opening angle of @xmath7 .",
    "this outflow experiences a strong collimation at the _ projected _ distance equivalent to @xmath1 @xmath8 ( schwarzschild radii ) from the central supermassive black hole ( hereafter ` smbh ' ) , i.e. , with the appropriate conversion @xmath9  @xmath10arcsec  @xmath11  pc , at the distance of @xmath12  mas @xmath13  pc .",
    "the collimation continues out to @xmath14  pc from the center , where the jet adopts an opening angle @xmath15 that remains roughly stable further away from the core . a detection of synchrotron self - absorption features in the radio spectrum of the m  87 nuclear region allowed the placement of an upper limit on the jet magnetic field @xmath16 g at @xmath17 pc @xcite .",

    "the results of _ very large array _ , _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ hubble _ monitoring programs presented by @xcite and @xcite established month - to - year variability of its radio - to - x - ray synchrotron continuum , with a comparable amplitude over the entire broad waveband .",

    "hubble _ , indicating its spatial dimension smaller than @xmath40 pc .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field at the position of this knot , when evaluated at the quiescence state and neglecting corrections due to expected relativistic bulk velocity of the radiating plasma , is of the order of @xmath41 g. magnetic field lines thereby are predominantly perpendicular to the jet axis , as suggested by polarization studies @xcite .",
    "the degree of the linear polarization decreases from @xmath42 upstream of the hst-1 flaring region ( @xmath43 pc ) , to @xmath44 at the position of the flux maximum ( @xmath29 pc ) , and then to @xmath45 downstream of it ( @xmath46 pc ) .",

    "@xmath48  pc away from the center the jet brightens significantly , forming a prominent knot ( knot a ) followed by the subsequent knots ( b and c ) , to disappear at approximately @xmath49  kpc into an amorphous radio lobe visible at low radio frequencies @xcite .",

    "as argued below , one can instead use the optical observations to constrain the parameters of this gaseous medium .",
    "optical observations of m  87 reported by @xcite indicate that the modified isothermal sphere model ( usually applied to elliptical galaxies ) is inconsistent with the observed starlight emission profile for the projected radii of @xmath77 .",
    "in particular , they showed a presence of a central luminosity excess , explained by @xcite in terms of a dynamical effect of a smbh placed at the center of the galaxy on its stellar neighborhood .",
    "_ hubble _ observations @xcite confirmed the presence of this additional stellar component in agreement with the interpretation involving @xmath78 smbh strongly bounding nearby stars and creating a central stellar cusp with an increased stellar velocity dispersion ( in this context see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the observed optical ( starlight ) surface brightness profile of the host galaxy is therefore described by @xmath79 with @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and composed of two separate components , namely a central cusp with the luminosity density @xmath84 pc@xmath85 ( in the @xmath86 filter for @xmath87 ) , and a modified king profile with the curvature radius @xmath88 and a tidal radius @xmath89 .",
    "the later component is consistent with a general property of the elliptical galaxies , namely @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , in the case of the adiabatic growth of a central smbh ( i.e. , the growth at a rate slower than the dynamical time scale of the stellar cluster but faster than the relaxation time scale ) , the expected density profile of stars follows a power law , @xmath91 with @xmath92 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the expected starlight brightness profile for the adiabatic stellar cusp is @xmath93 , i.e. much steeper than the one observed in m  87 .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the behavior discussed by @xcite is in fact an asymptotic one , holding for @xmath94 , while in the outer regions of a cusp an expected profile should be flatter , similar to @xmath95 observed in m  87 .",
    "this central stellar cusp profile joins smoothly with the galactic starlight profile @xmath96 at further distances from the core , implying a stellar density dependence of @xmath97 .",
    "note that _ hubble _ observations @xcite of elliptical galaxies show that they never possess a homogeneous surface brightness distribution @xmath98 expected in the case of a pure king - like profile , but they can be divided into two classes : ( i ) the ` core type ' galaxies with the brightness profile described by a broken power law with @xmath99 and @xmath100 within some critical ( break ) radius @xmath101 ( in m  87 case @xmath102 ) , and ( ii ) the ` power - law type ' galaxies characterized by a single value of @xmath103 within the whole central region . as noted recently by @xcite , radio loud galaxies are always of the ` core type ' , although not every ` core type ' galaxy is radio loud .",
    "also , the break radius is proportional to the galactic luminosity , roughly @xmath104 .",
    "one can therefore suspect the presence of an additional thermal pressure component within the host galaxies of radio - loud agns , ` matching ' the central stellar cusps .",
    "our main assumption follows from the observational fact reported by @xcite , that the optical and x - ray surface brightness profiles for three bright virgo  a ellipticals are almost identical , i.e. that @xmath105 . since the starlight emissivity is proportional to the number density of the stars , while the x - ray ( bremsstrahlung ) emissivity is proportional to the square of the hot gas number density , one obtains @xmath106 .",
    "this result was considered by @xcite as a general property of elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , in the case of m  87 host galaxy , at the distances @xmath107 one observes @xmath108 leading to @xmath109 , and at the same time @xmath110 leading to @xmath111^{1/2 } \\propto r^{-1.2}$ ] ( see above ) .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the expected behavior @xmath112 .",

    "we believe that this excess can be related to a condensation of the hot interstellar medium in the central parts of the host galaxy , as discussed above . in the case of the m  87 source , however , it would be difficult to claim a presence of an analogous feature at @xmath167 pc based on the available _ chandra _ data , due to extremely complicated m  87 x - ray structure consisting of gaseous rings , voids , as well as due to strong non - thermal kev emission of the jet itself ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of such complexity , the thermal pressure profile proposed above should be really considered as a simple approximation only . for the purpose of the analysis presented below ,",
    "it is however accurate enough .",
    "let us note , that the spatial scale for the postulated here central gaseous condensation is very small when compared to the scale of the m  87 radio lobes .",
    "thus , its presence does not contradict with widely discussed disruption of cooling - flow atmospheres by kpc - scale radio outflows ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for the particular case of m  87 source ) .",
    "in fact , the sound - crossing time over the region with the spatial scale @xmath168 is less than @xmath169 myr ( for the interstellar medium parameters as considered in this section ) , i.e. less than the lifetime of the inner lobes in the m  87 radio galaxy @xcite , suggesting relatively short timescale for formation / regeneration of the central gaseous cusp .",
    "we do not intend to explain here the observed gradual collimation of the m  87 jet in its innermost parts .",
    "instead we note that the initial collimation of the broad nuclear outflow may be due to a dynamically dominating magnetic field @xcite , as the jets in active galactic nuclei are most likely launched by the magnetohydrodynamical processes . on the other hand ,",
    "a dominant electromagnetic jet flux should be converted at some point to the particle flux , since the large - scale jets seem to be rather particle dominated ( see a discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "let us therefore speculate , that at sufficiently large distance from the nucleus  where the initial collimation is completed  the relativistic jet in the m  87 radio galaxy is already particle dominated , and starts to expand freely .",
    "in such freely expanding jet , the pressure decreases very rapidly with the distance , @xmath170 , from the core .",
    "for example , in the case of cold jet matter the thermal pressure goes as @xmath171 for @xmath172 @xcite . at the same time , the ambient gas pressure decreases much less rapidly : above we argue that in the m  87 galaxy one has @xmath173 with @xmath174 for @xmath175 pc .",
    "hence , as @xmath176 , accordingly to the discussion in @xcite , the initially free jet in m  87 certainly ( i ) will become reconfined at some point @xmath177 , ( ii ) will develop a reconfinement shock at its boundary , possibly leading to limb - brightenings of the reconfining outflow , and moreover ( iii ) the converging reconfinement shock will reach the jet axis at some further position along the jet , @xmath178 , beyond which the whole jet itself will come to a pressure equilibrium with the external gas medium .",
    "a simple evaluation of the reconfinement shock parameters is presented in appendix a for the cases of the jet matter described by a non - relativistic equation of state ( hereafter ` cold jet ' ) , as done previously in @xcite ( see also in this context * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite noted that at the projected distance @xmath179 pc from the core the jet radio morphology ( opening angle , transverse intensity profile ) changes .",
    "further out , beyond @xmath180 pc , the jet brightness drops below the detection level , and then increases again at @xmath181 pc forming a weak radio knot l. beyond this knot , the jet radio brightness decreases again , until @xmath182 pc where a very bright knot , hst-1 appears ( see section 1 ) . bearing in mind all the difficulties and uncertainties present in measurements regarding detailed morphology of the nuclear jet radio structure ,",
    "we conclude that it is reasonable to identify @xmath177 with the jet region between @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( i.e. @xmath185 pc ) from the m  87 center , and to assume that the jet thereby is already relativistic and particle dominated . indeed , the initial  hydromagnetic by assumption  collimation of a broad nuclear outflow seems to be already completed at smaller distances from the core .",
    "@xcite argue that the poynting - flux dominated nuclear outflows in agns become kinetic flux dominated at distances @xmath186 , i.e. , in the case of m  87 radio galaxy , at about @xmath187 pc projected ( for @xmath188 ) , in agreement with our assumption .    with @xmath189",
    ", one should expect the reconfinement shock to reach the jet axis at @xmath190 projected distance from the center in the case of a cold jet , or at @xmath191 in the case of a hot jet ( see appendix a ) . in other words , if the jet at @xmath177 is dynamically dominated by cold particles , @xmath178 is expected to roughly coincide with the knot l , while for the ultrarelativistic jet matter  consisting of ( mildly ) relativistic particles plus magnetic field  @xmath178 should rather be identified with the hst-1 complex . again , noting all the rough approximations used by us to derive @xmath177 and @xmath178 , below we argue that the latter interpretation is more likely . when the reconfinement shock reaches the jet axis , converging supersonic flow downstream of the reconfinement shock is expected to create the second stationary ` reflected ' shock .",
    "this reflected shock is in turn diverging from the jet axis along the outflow , starting from @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "the jet pressure immediately beyond @xmath178 is therefore expected to be higher than the ambient medium pressure .",

    "the evaluated @xmath198 is shown in figure 3 for different jet viewing angles .",
    "note that for @xmath129 the implied luminosity is @xmath199 erg s@xmath5 , consistent with the jet power required to feed radio lobes @xcite .",

    "in the rest frame of the jet , the energy densities of different radiation fields depend on the bulk lorentz factor and inclination of some particular part of the jet .",
    "for example , the energy density of the starlight emission ( as well as of the cluster and cmb photon field ) are amplified in a plasma rest frame accordingly to @xmath245 .",

    "a shift in the deprojected position of the hst-1 flaring region due to a different jet viewing angle is of negligible importance , because the entire hst-1 complex is located within the central plateau of @xmath260 .",
    "the internal energy density of the jet synchrotron emission initially decreases with a growing velocity of the emitting region , but for the larger values of @xmath261 it increases again , since for a given @xmath262 the appropriate jet doppler factor @xmath141 decreases with an increasing ( large ) @xmath261 .",
    "one can however conclude , that for a wide range of parameters shown in figure 5 ( namely , @xmath263 and @xmath264 ) , in the rest frame of the hst-1 flaring region , the starlight emission is expected to dominate over the internal synchrotron photon field .",
    "on the other hand , one should be aware that as the hst-1 flaring point is unresolved ( while at the same time synchrotron energy density goes with the emission region size as @xmath265 ) , the estimated @xmath266 should be considered as a lower limit only . in addition , here we only considered a quiescent epoch of m  87 .",

    "let us suppose that the active core of m  87 experienced at some moment an outburst , resulting in the flare of its synchrotron emission and ejection of a portion of the `` jet matter '' with the excess kinetic power ( when compared to the steady - state epoch of the jet activity ) .",
    "both photons and particles travel along the jet , arriving at some time to the location of the hst-1 knot , where the reconfinement shock formed within a steady jet reaches the jet axis .",
    "flare synchrotron photons emitted by the active nucleus are then comptonized to tev energies ( hereafter ` ic / nuc ' process ) , while the excess jet matter shocked around @xmath178 causes synchrotron ( hereafter ` syn ' ) and the additional inverse - compton brightening of the hst-1 flaring region .",
    "as discussed in the previous section and also below , this additional inverse - compton brightening should be dominated by compton scattering of the starlight emission ( hereafter ` ic / star ' process ) or synchrotron self - compton process ( ` ssc ' ) .",
    "we note , that some short time - scale variations of the emission coming from the nucleus in its high state can be imprinted in the observed ic / nuc flux of the outer parts of the jet .",
    "in addition , due to different velocities of the nuclear photons and particles , tev flare resulting from the ic / nuc process in hst-1 knot is expected to lead syn , ic / star and ssc brightening of the hst-1 flaring region by some time @xmath273 .",
    "note that the increase in the seed photon energy density for a given synchrotron flux ( i.e. for a given particle energy density ) results in an increase of the inverse - compton flux only if the electrons involved in the inverse - compton scattering are weakly cooled by radiative losses ( ` slow cooling regime ' ) .",
    "assuming that the observed sub - luminal velocities of the jet features observed between the core and the hst-1 knot are only pattern velocities , not reflecting the true bulk velocity of the jet spine ( see a discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that this true bulk velocity is highly relativistic @xmath274 , the appropriate delay time difference is roughly @xmath275 where @xmath276 pc is a projected distance of the hst-1 flaring region from the core .",
    "for example , period @xmath277 yr between presumable maximum of the tev emission ( 1998/1999 ) and the observed maximum of the synchrotron emission of the hst-1 knot ( 2005 ) is consistent with the jet viewing angle @xmath278 for @xmath279 , with @xmath144 for @xmath280 , and finally with @xmath281 for @xmath282 .",

    "however , the ic / nuc emission could eventually account for the _ hegra _ detection ( @xmath309 erg s@xmath5 ) only if the bulk lorentz factor of the hst-1 flaring region was @xmath310 and the assumed nuclear flare was characterized by @xmath311 erg s@xmath5 ( as taken in figure 6 ) .",
    "we note , that for such parameters the comoving energy density of the nuclear photons , @xmath312 erg @xmath70 , dominates over the comoving energy densities of the magnetic field and the starlight emission ( @xmath313 erg @xmath70 and @xmath314 erg @xmath70 , respectively ) .",

    "the resulting small excess in x - ray surface brightness due to free - free radiation of the hot gas seems to be required to explain some _ chandra _ observations .",

    "we propose that in the case of the m  87 radio galaxy , hst-1 knot present at @xmath1 pc from the center can be identified with the downstream region of such a reconfinement / reflected shock . in particular , we argue that stationary , compact ( @xmath340 pc ) , variable ( on the time scale of , at least , months and years ) , and overpressured ( by a factor @xmath341 ) hst-1 flaring region is placed immediately downstream of the point where the converging reconfinement shock reaches the jet axis ( ` reconfinement nozzle ' ) .",
    "thereby _ some portion _ of the hot relativistic jet decelerates from highly relativistic to mildly relativistic bulk velocities ( from bulk lorentz factor @xmath342 down to @xmath316 ) , while other parts of the jet ( placed further away from the jet axis ) are expected to decelerate less strongly due to a larger angle between the upstream bulk velocity vector and the shock normal .",
    "the liberated bulk kinetic energy of the outflow is transformed at the shock front to the turbulent magnetic field energy ( consistently with the decrease in the degree of linear polarization observed in hst-1 knot ) , and , in similar amount ( by assumption ) , to the ultrarelativistic particles .",
    "although the reconfinement / reflected shock structure is stationary in the observer s rest frame , variations and changes in the central engine lead inevitably to flaring of this part of the outflow , in particular when the excess particles and photons emitted by the active nucleus in its high - activity epoch and traveling down the jet arrive after some time to the reconfinement nozzle . in a framework of this scenario",
    ", one should expect firstly high - energy @xmath0-ray flare due to comptonization of the photons from the nuclear outburst , and then , after some delay depending on the bulk velocity of the nuclear jet , synchrotron flare due to excess nuclear particles shocked at the nozzle .",
    "this delayed synchrotron flare could be accompanied by the subsequent inverse - compton brightening due to upscattering of the ambient radiation fields by the increased population of the ultrarelativistic particles .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that such a sequence of events was in fact observed in hst-1 flaring region , especially as for a realistic set of the jet parameters the evaluated radiative fluxes are in agreement with the multiwavelength observations performed between 1998 and 2005 .",

    "<S> stimulated by recent observations of a giant radio - to - x - ray synchrotron flare from hst-1 , the innermost knot of the m  87 jet , as well as by a detection of a very high energy @xmath0-ray emission from m  87 , we investigated the dynamics and multiwavelength emission of the hst-1 region . </S>",
    "<S> we study thermal pressure of the hot interstellar medium in m  87 and argue for a presence of a gaseous condensation in its central parts . </S>",
    "<S> we postulate that this additional feature is linked to the observed central stellar cusp of the elliptical host . </S>",
    "<S> interaction of the jet with such a feature is likely to result in formation of a stationary converging / diverging reconfinement / reflected shock structure in the innermost parts of the m  87 jet . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for a realistic set of the outflow parameters , a stationary and a flaring part of the hst-1 knot located @xmath1 pc away from the active center can be associated with the decelerated portion of the jet matter placed immediately downstream of the point where the reconfinement shock reaches the jet axis . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a possible scenario explaining a broad - band brightening of the hst-1 region related to the variable activity of the central core . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that assuming a previous epoch of the high central black hole activity resulting in ejection of excess particles and photons down along the jet , one may first expect a high - energy flare of hst-1 due to inverse - comptonisation of the nuclear radiation , followed after a few years by an increase in the synchrotron continuum of this region . </S>",
    "<S> the synchrotron flare itself could be accompanied by a subsequent inverse - compton brightening due to upscattering of the ambient ( mostly starlight ) photons . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , then the recently observed order - of - magnitude increase in the knot luminosity in all spectral bands could be regarded as an unusual echo of the order - of - magnitude outburst that had happened previously ( and could be eventually observed some @xmath2 years ago ) in the highly relativistic active core of the m  87 radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that very high energy @xmath0-ray fluxes expected in a framework of the proposed scenario are consistent with the observed ones .    </S>",
