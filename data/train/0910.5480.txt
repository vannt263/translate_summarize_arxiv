    "recent interest in modified theories of gravity has been spurred by the discovery that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest solution consistent with these observations posits a cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of this cosmological constant is significantly less than what was expected , and many undertakings have been made to see if there are plausible alternative explanations  @xcite .",
    "outstanding questions also present themselves in the formation of singularities  @xcite and the seeming contradiction between quantum mechanics and gravity in the context of black hole thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "all these suggest that there may yet be much to understand about the nature of gravity at extreme - curvature scales , far removed from our everyday experience .",
    "the two most popular approaches to modifying gravity have been the introduction of an additional scalar field ( e.g.  @xcite ) , or the related approach of replacing the einstein - hilbert action with a general function of the ricci scalar @xmath0 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . within either framework the additional scalar degree of freedom can be tuned to mimic the cosmological constant , or any type of cosmological evolution at cosmological scales  @xcite .    despite the premise of such modifications , the non - linear character of gravitational theories has proven a significant obstacle to introducing new dynamical fields to drive modifications to gravity at the cosmological scale without the same fields reemerging at widely different curvature scales .",
    "one such example is the problem of ensuring that @xmath2 theories pass the current parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) bounds . when the new field is dynamical , the ppn parameter @xmath3 is forced to a value of @xmath4 , which is very far from the present experimental bound  @xcite . as a result one has to choose a function @xmath0 only from the class which can adequately suppress the new dynamical field on solar - system scales .",
    "the chameleon mechanism  @xcite provides such an alternative .",
    "in addition to the ppn constraints , instabilities related to the functional form of @xmath0 have also been studied at length .",
    "this is especially true for the dolgov - kawasaki instability  @xcite , which requires that @xmath5 in order that the effective mass of the equivalent scalar degree of freedom be positive . in the strong - field regime",
    ", recent results  @xcite suggest that this very choice may well prohibit the formation of compact objects above a curvature scale readily observed .",
    "however , the fatal curvature singularity may be avoided by the chameleon mechanism  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the source of the instabilities and consistency issues many of these models encounter is the result of treating these modifications as though they are exact .",
    "the original motivation behind introducing additional functions of the curvature was to generate a new phenomenology at a specific scale .",
    "however , many of the problems encountered by @xmath0 gravity theories originate at curvature scales far removed from the ones under consideration . an alternative formulation for handling corrections to general relativity is to view the new terms as only the next to leading order terms in a larger expansion . in this context",
    "there is no reason to suspect that the new phenomenology is due to new dynamical fields .",
    "the technique for handling a field expansion of this form is well developed  @xcite and is known as perturbative constraints or order reduction  @xcite .",
    "gravity with perturbative constraints allows us to explore alternative phenomenologies of gravity while maintaining important consistency conditions including gauge invariance , the assumption that we are approximating a fundamentally second order field theory , and the conservation of stress - energy .",
    "maintaining such constraints while enlarging the space of possible behaviors of gravitation is the goal also of the parametrized post - friedman approach  @xcite .    in previous works",
    "@xcite , we have analyzed the effect of treating @xmath0 models of gravity via perturbative constraints primarily at cosmological scales . in this paper , we examine the ramifications of modifications to gravity in the context of compact objects .",
    "we show how the method of perturbative constraints allows for a consistent phenomenology for gravity on both large ( hubble - length perturbations linear in metric variables , but strongly relativistic , @xmath6 ) and small scales ( stellar scales , non - linear in metric perturbations , and strongly relativistic , @xmath7 . )",
    "the layout of this work is as follows . in section  [ pcsec ] , we review the equations of @xmath0 gravity treated with perturbative constraints . in section  [ spcsec ] ,",
    "we derive the modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations and show that the exterior solution is the schwartzchild - de sitter metric . in section  [ mrsec ] , we demonstrate that such objects are stable and we solve numerically for their mass - radius relation for a polytropic equations of state . finally in section  [ dis ]",
    "we discuss how we can discriminate modifications to gravity from uncertainty in the neutron star equation of state .",
    "gravity with perturbative constraints  @xcite ( or order - reduction  @xcite ) is a technique for treating equations of motion that appear higher than second order , where the origin of the higher derivatives can be traced to the truncation of an infinite series expansion .",
    "such a situation can arise with non - local theories as well as effective field theories .    in the context of @xmath0 gravity theories , we parametrize the deviation from general relativity by a single parameter @xmath8 and derive the equation of motion from a covariant action @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\   & & +   { \\it s_m}(g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 .",

    "the equations we have derived so far are general and accommodate any choice for the correction @xmath0 to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "however , in constructing numerical models of neutron stars in @xmath0 theories , we need to specify at this point the particular value of the parameter @xmath19 we will use .    in order to address concerns for the structure and stability of neutron stars in cosmologically motivated modifications of gravity ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) , we might consider the case @xmath73 ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) .",
    "since the matter density and pressure directly determine the ricci scalar , we would anticipate such a term to be the leading order correction for small - curvature scales .",

    "we utilize the same dimensionless variables as in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath81 because of this normalization of the various physical quantities , our results are independent of the normalization @xmath82 of the polytropic equation of state .",
    "we use a fourth order runge - kutte integrator with adaptive stepsize to solve for the mass @xmath83 and radius @xmath13 of the star .",
    "we start at the center of the star by specifying its density ( and corresponding pressure ) there and integrate out to its surface defined where the pressure vanishes .",
    "figure  [ mrhograph ] shows the dependence of the mass of a neutron star on its central density in an @xmath75 theory , for different values of the small parameter @xmath84 .",
    "the central line corresponds to neutron stars in general relativity .",
    "as expected , for stable neutron stars the deviation from the general relativistic case becomes significant as the central density of the neutron star increases , since it is the matter density that directly determines the value of the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "moreover , the sign of the deviation is determined by the sign of the perturbative parameter @xmath84 . by properly choosing the sign and magnitude of this parameter",
    ", we can cause an increase or a decrease in the maximum mass of stable neutron stars for a particular central density .",
    "we can also support stars of a certain mass and radius for a range of central densities and @xmath84 .",
    "the maximum allowed magnitude of the deviations from the general relativistic predictions is , of course , constrained by the requirement that the solutions retain their perturbative validity .",
    "though this constraint does not have a ready analytic expression , we can nevertheless explore after the fact the perturbative validity of each stellar model .",
    "in particular , as a measure of the deviations from the general relativistic solution we choose the ratio @xmath85 - 1 .",
    "\\label{eq : xi}\\ ] ] this ratio varies with radius inside the neutron star .",
    "it achieves , however , its highest value at or near the center of the star , where the density ( and hence the curvature ) is large .",
    "because we require the entire solution to be perturbatively close to the general relativistic one , we will evaluate the ratio @xmath86 at its maximum . a necessary condition for perturbative validity",
    "is @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ stabagraph ] shows the maximum ratio @xmath86 as a function of the parameter @xmath84 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that neutron stars in @xmath75 theories can certainly be treated perturbatively as long as @xmath88 .    of particular interest from an observational point of view",
    "is the mass - radius relation for neutron stars .",
    "we show this relation , for the same polytropic equation of state , in figure  [ mrgraph ] . depending on the value and sign of the parameter @xmath8",
    ", we obtain stars with larger or smaller radii compared to their general relativistic counterparts of the same gravitational mass .",
    "the extent of this variation is constrained by perturbative validity , which prevents the onset of dynamical features such as spontaneous scalarization  @xcite .",
    "the predicted mass - radius relation for neutron stars in @xmath0 gravity shown above differs from that computed within general relativity .",
    "however , very similar deviations in the mass - radius relation can also be obtained within general relativity by simply changing the polytropic index of the equation of state ( see  @xcite for examples ) .",
    "because the equation of state of neutron - star matter is weakly constrained by current experiments , neutron - star observables that depend only on the mass and radius of the star can not distinguish between small differences in the equation of state versus small modifications to gravity .    in",
    "@xcite it was shown that observables that depend also on the effective surface gravity of neutron stars can break , in principle , this degeneracy . in particular",

    "a neutron star cools both through photon and neutrino emission .",
    "the photon luminosity is determined by the temperature at the photosphere , which in turn depends on the density of the photosphere .",
    "however neutrino cooling , which depends more sensitively on temperature than photon cooling does , becomes dominant for neutron stars with temperatures above @xmath106 , and indeed is the primary mechanism of cooling for young neutron stars ( see  @xcite for a detailed review ) .",
    "the high temperature and low interaction rate make neutrino cooling particularly sensitive to the central density of the neutron star .",

    "large positive deviations from general relativity , as measured by the parameter @xmath84 require larger central densities for neutron stars of a given mass , whereas the opposite is true for large negative deviations . as a result",
