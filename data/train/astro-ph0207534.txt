    "the cold dark matter plus cosmological constant ( lcdm ) model of structure formation is the most successful and popular current theory for the origin of universal structure .",
    "the theory is highly predictive , and given that observations constrain the universe to be nearly flat ( with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) a crucial unknown is the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "it is usually assumed that the initial fluctuation spectrum is scale - invariant , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that slow - roll inflation models predict _ nearly _ scale - invariant spectra . however",
    ", generic models of inflation do not predict primordial power spectra that are _ exactly _ scale - invariant and almost all models have some small , often non - negligible , `` tilt '' ( @xmath12 ) and `` running '' of the spectral index ( @xmath13 ) . in this proceeding we report on our work to model the small - scale implications of reasonable initial power spectra , and",
    "demonstrate that the substructure content and central densities of dark halos should be very sensitive to small deviations from scale - invariance .",
    "our models are semi - analytic , but they are normalized and tested against n - body simulations . as we discuss below , our results may be important for interpreting galaxy rotation curves , dwarf galaxy counts , and substructure mass fractions as measured from multiply imaged quasars .",
    "in zentner & bullock @xcite ( hereafter zb1 and zb2 ) we chose several well - motivated and representative inflation models and calculated the implied power spectra to second order in slow - roll using the method of stewart and gong @xcite . adopting @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( lcdm )",
    ", we calculated p(k ) using the results of eisenstein & hu @xcite and normalized to cobe on the pivot scale , @xmath18 h@xmath19mpc .",
    "in the interest of brevity , we report on only three models here :    * ipl : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , + @xmath22 * rm : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , + @xmath25 * @xmath0 : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , + @xmath28 .",
    "the tilt and running are evaluated at @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the rms fluctuation amplitude within spheres of @xmath31mpc implied by the cobe normalization .",
    "observational constraints on @xmath30 have historically favored a value near unity ; however , some recent estimates indicate surprisingly low values of @xmath30 @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath32 spans the range of recently reported values ( for @xmath33 ) .",
    "lcdm halos , and the short and long - dashed lines correspond to our expectations for two different inflation - derived input power spectra . ]",
    "the theory of cdm has survived remarkably well since its creation roughly twenty years ago @xcite , but lingering for nearly half this time has been a possible problem with galaxy central densities @xcite , which seem to be much less dense than the standard cdm model typically predicts .",
    "one part of this problem  the cusp vs. core question  concerns the precise inner slope of galaxy rotation curves and whether they match the `` cuspy '' predictions of cdm theory .",
    "this particular question is highly debated , and some argue that observational errors and/or theoretical uncertainties make the comparisons inconclusive . but even among those who believe there may be no problem with the _ shapes _ of rotation curves ( the authors included ) , it is almost universally agreed upon that the data do prefer halos that are less centrally concentrated than typical halos in the standard ( @xmath0 ) lcdm model .    one way to see the problem is by comparing rotation curve data to theory using the following , non - parametric measure of the density @xcite : @xmath34 this is the mean dark matter density within the radius @xmath35 where the galaxy rotation curve falls to half its maximum , @xmath36 . in practical units , @xmath37 .    in figure 1 , we plot @xmath38 measured from several dark matter - dominated galaxy rotation curves ( data from @xcite , see zb1 for details ) and compare to predictions for _ typical _ halo densities in our models with different power spectra ( lines ) . notice that the @xmath0 model overpredicts the galactic densities by a factor of @xmath1 , while our inflation - motivated models with @xmath39 do much better .",
    "the predictions were made using the semi - analytic model of bullock et al .",
    "@xcite , which was shown to reproduce the halo densities measured in n - body simulations for @xmath0 and @xmath40 lcdm power spectra as well as a variety of power - law models ( see zb1 for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "the model is similar to that originally proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although modified in order to reproduce the redshift dependence seen in n - body halos .",
    "qualitatively , it embodies the fact that halo densities reflect the density of the universe at their characteristic collapse redshift .",
    "halos in models with less small - scale power collapse later , when the universe is less dense , and therefore have more diffuse cores .",
    "interestingly , even the `` ipl '' case , with only a moderate tilt and mild running , does significantly better than the @xmath0 standard model .",
    "if we adopt the criterion that a `` good '' fit to the data has @xmath41 at @xmath42 kms@xmath19 then the data prefer @xmath43 , assuming that the primordial spectrum is the only element of the solution .",
    "as mentioned briefly in the previous section , the input power spectrum greatly affects the typical merger history of galaxy - sized halos .",
    "halos formed in models with less power on galactic scales typically form later , and accrete a larger fraction of their substructure at later epochs . similarly ,",
    "the `` subhalos '' that are accreted also form later , are less dense , and therefore are more easily tidally disrupted . in order to explore",
    "how different initial power spectra affect the substructure content of halos quantitatively , we developed a semi - analytic model that tracks halo accretion histories using the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite and follows subhalo orbital evolution in a semi - analytic fashion .    ) lcdm host halos of mass @xmath44 .",
    "the long - dashed line shows all accreted subhalos .",
    "the short - dashed line shows subhalos that were tidally destroyed , and the dotted line those that merged with the central object .",
    "subhalos that exist at @xmath45 are shown by the thick solid line .",
    "error bars correspond to the rms scatter .",
    "subhalo counts from two different n - body simulations are shown by the thin solid lines .",
    "both agree reasonably well with our model expectations . ]",
    "described in detail in zb2 , our model expands on the calculations presented in bullock , kravtsov & weinberg @xcite and includes some modifications similar to those advocated by taylor and babul @xcite . briefly , after each merger event , we follow the subhalo orbital evolution as it decays due to dynamical friction and loses mass via tidal interactions with the host halo .",
    "dynamical friction dominates for large subhalos , which typically merge with the central object soon after accretion .",
    "low mass substructures are efficiently stripped by the host potential , and a large fraction of them become completely tidally destroyed .",
    "the results of our model for an ensemble of milky way - like host halos in an @xmath0 lcdm cosmology are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "shown as a function of @xmath46 are the total number of objects that have been accreted compared to the number that eventually merge with the central object , the number that are tidally destroyed , and the number that survive as distinct substructures at @xmath45 .",
    "it is clear that our model for the number of surviving structures is in good agreement with the results of n - body simulations ( thin solid lines ) @xcite .",
    "we use this model to estimate the sensitivity of the substructure population at @xmath45 to the primordial power spectrum .      shown in figure 3",
    "are the cumulative subhalo velocity functions for each of our models compared to two different estimates of dwarf galaxy counts within @xmath47kpc of the milky way and m31 @xcite .",
    "that @xmath0 lcdm overpredicts the number of small satellites by roughly an order of magnitude is expected .",
    "this is the well - known dwarf satellite problem ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the number of subhalos is reduced by as much as a factor of @xmath4 for the inflation - derived power spectra that we consider .",
    "although all of these cases would require some degree of feedback to match dwarf counts ( e.g. , ionization @xcite ) , the _ amount _ of feedback needed will depend sensitively on the input power spectrum .",
    "related to the dwarf satellite problem are recent efforts to measure the substructure content in halos using the flux ratios in multiply imaged quasars @xcite .",
    "for example , dalal and kochanek used this technique to constrain the fraction of the host halo mass bound up in substructure to be @xmath48 ( 90 % confidence ) .",
    "they went on to use this result to try to limit the tilt of the primordial spectrum using a simplified model for the abundance of substructure and obtained @xmath49 at 95% confidence . our results on substructure differ from those of dalal and kochanek , as illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "we find that for a host halo of the relevant mass , the total mass fraction in subhalos is typically larger than the their lower limit ( @xmath50 ) even for our most tilted primordial spectrum , @xmath51 .",
    "since this model is on the edge of what is acceptable by @xmath30 constraints , it seems that strong lensing does not yet serve as a significant probe of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "( using a version of our model , dalal and kochanek are in the process of revising their limits , and now find results more in line with those reported here @xcite . )                        metcalf , r.  b.  & madau , p.  2001 , apj , 563 , 9 ; chiba , m. 2002 , apj , 565 , 17 ; dalal , n.  & kochanek , c.  s.  2002 , apj , 572 , 25 ; dalal , n.  & kochanek , c.  s.  2002 , prd , submitted , astro - ph/0202290 ; moustakas , l.a . & metcalf , r.b .",
