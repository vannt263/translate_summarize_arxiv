    "ultrasonic tests of mechanical properties of polymers and bio - tissues assume that the material is viscoelastic . in applications a linear viscoelastic material",
    "is always assumed to have a completely monotonic ( cm ) relaxation modulus @xcite .",
    "this assumption has important consequences for the attenuation and dispersion of acoustic waves . in particular , the increase of attenuation with frequency in the high frequency range is slower than linear @xcite .",
    "this fact can not be verified experimentally because experimental test cover the range of frequencies below 250 mhz .",
    "the results of ultrasonic tests of polymers and bio - tissues suggest a power - law dependence of attenuation in the frequency range accessible to measurements , @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "this power - law dependence is then extrapolated to high frequency range , where it contradicts various general principles .",
    "it is then explained in terms of _ ad hoc _ lossy wave equations @xcite and wave equations with fractional laplacians @xcite which are incompatible with viscoelastic constitutive equations .",
    "superlinear growth of attenuation in the high frequency range is inconsistent with finite speed of propagation .",
    "the requirement of finite speed of propagation imposes an upper growth limit @xmath2 on high - frequency attenuation : the propagation speed is finite if @xmath3 , @xmath1 but not for @xmath4 .",
    "superlinear growth of attenuation in the high frequency range is also inconsistent with viscoelastic constitutive equations even if the propagation speed is infinite , for example it is inconsistent with newtonian viscosity , where the attenuation satisfies the power law @xmath5 , and with strongly singular locally integrable completely monotonic relaxation moduli @xcite .",
    "according to the theory of wave propagation in viscoelastic media with completely monotonic relaxation moduli , developed in @xcite , in the low frequency range the wave attenuation in a viscoelastic solid increases like @xmath6 , @xmath7 , while a viscoelastic fluid is characterized by a rate of increase @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "low frequency behavior of attenuation is accessible to measurements and is consistent with observations . in the high frequency range",
    "the growth of attenuation is however sublinear .",
    "high frequency attenuation is also sublinear in viscoelastic media with spatial derivative operators of fractional order @xcite .",
    "although practical modeling of viscoelastic media routinely assumes that the relaxation modulus is completely monotonic , there is hardly any a priori evidence for this assumption .",
    "the only general physical principle  the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  implies that the relaxation modulus is completely positive @xcite .",
    "the consequences of complete positivity for the dependence of attenuation on frequency are however at present unknown . in this paper",
    "we explore the consequences of a different extension of the complete monotonicity assumption , based on the assumption that the creep compliance is non - decreasing and concave .",
    "non - negative functions with these two properties are said to belong to the crf class , which is an abbreviation of prss unfortunate term `` creep functions '' .",
    "the above assumption , proposed and explored in jan prss book @xcite , is much weaker than the hypothesis of a completely monotonic relaxation modulus , assumed in @xcite .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the creep compliance being a bernstein function , which is defined in terms of an infinite sequence of inequalities for the derivatives of the creep compliance of arbitrary order . in the crf class",
    "only the three first of these inequalities are required to hold .",
    "the bernstein class and the crf class includes newtonian viscosity characterized by linear creep . unlike the bernstein property",
    ", the crf property of a function can be easily visually recognized from its plot .",
    "furthermore , the crf property is stable with respect to perturbations which are small in the sup norm .",
    "it will be shown here that wave attenuation in media with crf creep compliances is bounded by a function @xmath10 .",
    "a sharper form of this bound was obtained for creep compliances in the bernstein class in @xcite .",
    "the theory developed in @xcite relies on a spectral analysis of attenuation and dispersion .",
    "unfortunately a spectral analysis of attenuation and dispersion similar to the completely monotonic case has not been possible but it is very likely that the bound obtained here for the crf class of creep compliances can be significantly sharpened .    after a recapitulation of necessary facts from the theory of cm functions and bernstein functions ( sec .
