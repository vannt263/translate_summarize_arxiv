    "let @xmath1 be a noetherian local ring of prime characteristic @xmath9 and dimension @xmath0 which is f - finite , and with algebraically closed residue field @xmath5 .",
    "for every @xmath10 , let @xmath11 , and let @xmath12 be the @xmath4-module which is equal to @xmath4 as abelian group and has scalar multiplication twisted via the @xmath13-th frobenius homomorphism , that is @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we decompose it as @xmath17 where the module @xmath18 has no free direct summands . the number @xmath19 is also called the _ free rank _ of @xmath12 and denoted by @xmath20 , while if @xmath4 is a domain , one has that @xmath21 , the usual rank of an @xmath4-module .",
    "huneke and leuschke @xcite defined the _",
    "f - signature _ of @xmath4 as the limit @xmath22    they proved that the limit defining the f - signature exists assuming that @xmath4 is gorenstein and in other cases . watanabe and yoshida @xcite introduced the _ minimal relative hilbert - kunz multiplicity_.",
    "then , yao @xcite proved it actually coincides with the f - signature .",
    "finally , tucker @xcite proved that the f - signature exists for every reduced f - finite noetherian local ring .",
    "the f - signature is a real number between @xmath8 and @xmath23 and provides delicate information about the singularities of @xmath4 .",
    "two principal results in this direction are the fact that @xmath24 if and only if the ring is regular @xcite , and that @xmath25 if and only if @xmath4 is strongly f - regular @xcite .    the main motivation for this paper is given by the following question .",
    "does there exist an invariant analogous to the f - signature which is independent of the characteristic and can be used to study singularities also in characteristic zero ?    a possible natural attempt to define a characteristic zero version of the f - signature is the following . if @xmath4 is a reduced @xmath26-algebra such that @xmath27 is dominant , then for every prime number @xmath9 we consider its reduction mod @xmath9 , @xmath28 , and compute the f - signature @xmath29 .",
    "one may ask whether the limit @xmath30 exists , and use this limit to define a characteristic @xmath8 version of the f - signature .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to find an appropriate meaning and compute the previous limit , or even determine whether it exists at all . if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are distinct prime numbers , the two frobenius homomorphisms are difficult to compare .",
    "if @xmath4 is a domain then the rank of @xmath33 and the rank of @xmath34 are different , the first one being @xmath35 .    in this paper",
    "we define a new invariant called _ symmetric signature _ which works in any characteristic . as inspiration for our construction , we considered two important properties of the modules @xmath12 which we would like to keep .",
    "the first fact is a result of kunz @xcite which states that @xmath12 is a free module ( for all or for some @xmath10 ) if and only if @xmath4 is a regular ring .",
    "next , if the ring @xmath4 is cohen - macaulay then @xmath12 is a maximal cohen - macaulay ( mcm for short ) module .",
    "let @xmath1 be a noetherian local @xmath5-algebra of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we look for an @xmath4-module with the property that it is free if and only if @xmath4 is regular .",
    "we have at least two modules with this property : the _ top - dimensional syzygy module of the residue field _ @xmath36 , and the _ module of ( khler ) differentials _ @xmath3 of @xmath4 over @xmath5 or its dual .",
    "if @xmath4 is cohen - macaulay , then the module @xmath36 is mcm by the depth lemma , on the other hand @xmath3 is not even reflexive in general . for this reason we prefer to work with its reflexive hull , @xmath37 , which is called _ module of zariski differentials of @xmath4 over @xmath5_. the sign @xmath38 stands for the functor @xmath39 .",
    "we want to study an asymptotic behaviour , so we construct two classes of modules ( one for @xmath36 , and one for @xmath37 ) indexed by a natural number @xmath40 .",
    "to do this we introduce the functor of @xmath40-th reflexive symmetric powers @xmath41 , that is ordinary @xmath40-th symmetric powers of @xmath4-modules composed with the reflexive hull .",
    "the choice of studying symmetric powers is motivated by an unpublished work of brenner and fischbacher - weitz @xcite .",
    "symmetric powers of cotangent bundles on projective varieties have been studied also by other authors such as bogomolov and de oliveira@xcite , and sakai @xcite . instead , the reflexive hull is motivated by the fact that we want to stay inside the category of reflexive modules , which coincides with the category of mcm @xmath4-modules if @xmath4 is a normal two - dimensional domain .",
    "more precisely , we procede as follows .",
    "we consider @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 the situation is analogous ) and we apply to it the @xmath40-th reflexive symmetric powers functor for a natural number @xmath40 .",
    "we obtain a reflexive @xmath4-module @xmath42    we decompose the module @xmath43 as @xmath44 with the module @xmath18 containing no free direct summands , so that @xmath45 the free rank of @xmath43 .",
    "for ease of notation we fix also @xmath46 , and we introduce the following ( definition [ defsymmetricsignature ] ) .",
    "the real number @xmath47 is called _ ( syzygy ) symmetric signature _ of @xmath4 , provided the limit exists .    replacing the module @xmath36 with @xmath37 in the previous construction",
    "we define also the _ differential symmetric signature _ of @xmath4 , which we denote by @xmath48 .    in order to understand the behaviour of these new invariants in comparison with the f - signature we concentrate on two important classes of examples : two - dimensional kleinian singularities , and coordinate rings of plane elliptic curves .",
    "two - dimensional kleinian or ade singularities are the rings of invariants @xmath49 of a power series ring in two variables @xmath50 under the linear action of certain finite subgroups @xmath51 of @xmath52 , called klein groups .",
    "the field @xmath5 is algebraically closed and such that its characteristic does not divide the order of the acting group @xmath51 .",
    "watanabe and yoshida @xcite proved that if the characteristic of @xmath5 is a prime number then the f - signature of @xmath4 is @xmath53 .",
    "we prove that the same holds for the symmetric and the differential symmetric signature in any characteristic ( corollary [ corollarykleinian ] ) , that is @xmath54    our main tool to prove this result is the so - called _ auslander correspondence _ ( theorem [ auslandertheorem ] ) .",
    "this states that for a kleinian singularitiy @xmath49 there is a functorial one to one correspondence between irreducible @xmath5-representations of @xmath51 and indecomposable maximal cohen - macaulay @xmath4-modules .",
    "the module corresponding to a @xmath5-representation @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 .",
    "we prove that this construction commutes with @xmath40-th reflexive symmetric powers ( theorem [ symcommuteswithauslandertheorem ] ) , that is we have @xmath57 here , @xmath58 denotes the @xmath40-th symmetric power of an @xmath4-module , and @xmath59 is the @xmath40-th symmetric power of the representation @xmath55 .",
    "this result is the key to translate the problem of computing the symmetric signature into a problem in representation theory of finite groups .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the free rank of some mcm @xmath4-module @xmath60 is equal to the multiplicity of the trivial representation into @xmath55 , and the latter can be more easily computed using tools from representation theory , such as characters .    the symmetric signature of two - dimensional cyclic quotient singularities @xmath61 , with @xmath51 cyclic , is also @xmath6 and is computed by katthn and the second author in the paper @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be the coordinate ring of a plane elliptic curve over an algebraically closed field @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath4 is not strongly f - regular , therefore its f - signature is @xmath62 .",
    "we prove that the differential symmetric signature of @xmath4 is @xmath63 ( theorem [ theocotangentelliptic ] ) , provided that @xmath64 is not @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "for the syzygy symmetric signature we give an upper bound , that is @xmath67 ( corollary [ corsleq12elliptic ] ) , provided that the limit exists .",
    "the methods we use in this situation are geometric .",
    "we use the correspondence between graded mcm @xmath4-modules and vector bundles over the smooth projective curve @xmath68 , and we translate the problem of computing @xmath69 and @xmath48 into an analogous problem in the category @xmath70 of vector bundles over @xmath71 .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that over an elliptic curve @xmath71 the indecomposable vector bundles have been classified and described by atiyah @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .    in section [ sectionfandsymmetric ]",
    "we give a short review of the f - signature and its properties .",
    "then , we define the symmetric and differential symmetric signatures , together with some other variants : a generalized version for modules ( definition [ defgeneralizedsymmetric ] ) , and one for graded rings ( definition [ defgradedsymmetric ] ) . some easy properties and consequences of the symmetric signature",
    "are also stated in this section .",
    "in section [ sectionauslandersymmetric ] we review the theory of the auslander correspondence and we prove that the auslander functor commutes with reflexive symmetric powers ( theorem [ symcommuteswithauslandertheorem ] ) .",
    "section [ sectionkleinian ] is dedicated to the computation of the symmetric signatures of two - dimensional kleinian singularities , and section [ sectionelliptic ] to the computation of the symmetric signature for coordinate rings of plane elliptic curves .",
    "we recall some general facts about rings of prime characteristic , and the definition and basic properties of the f - signature .",

    "we say that @xmath4 is _ f - finite _ if @xmath82 is a finitely generated @xmath4-module , and we say that @xmath4 is _ f - split _ if the frobenius map @xmath83 splits .",
    "if @xmath1 is a complete noetherian local ring , then @xmath4 is f - finite if and only if @xmath84 $ ] is finite .",
    "we will always assume that our rings are f - finite , and that @xmath5 is perfect , that is @xmath84=1 $ ] .",
