    "the genesis of a novel state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) presumably formed in the recent experiments like relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) provides us a scope for rich investigative physics about hot and/or dense quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) matter @xcite .",
    "one of the excellent probes of qgp , formed in such collider experiments , is the quenching of jet as first anticipated by bjorken @xcite .",
    "the jet quenching or in other words energy loss of the fragmenting partons at high transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) causes depopulation of hadrons .",
    "most of the calculations of light hadrons ( @xmath2 ) considers the energy loss due to the induced bremsstrahlung radiation and this reproduces the experimentally observed nuclear suppression in @xmath3 collisions for center of mass energy @xmath4 gev at rhic @xcite .",
    "but recent data from the phenix collaboration  @xcite reveals that non - photonic single electron spectrum from heavy meson decays shows larger suppression than expected .",
    "one of the possible reasons behind this suppression of radiation of heavy quarks might be the effect of dead - cone .",
    "hence , radiative energy loss alone is insufficient to explain such attenuation @xcite . for the complete picture of energy loss",
    "then one should consider the collisional part both for light as well as for heavy quarks .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , the authors have shown that in a finite size medium one can neglect the collisional energy loss .",
    "whereas , later this finding has been contrasted in @xcite where , it has been argued that even finite - size effects are negligible @xcite .",
    "in rhic energies the authors have shown that colisional energy loss becomes probable and can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "the calculation of collisional energy loss of heavy fermion in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) or qcd plasma has already been studied since past few years  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks are the important analysing tool of the primordial state of matter as they are produced early in the time scale from the initial fusion of partons and do not influence the bulk properties of the matter . in all the previous estimations mentioned above",
    ", the presence of thermalized charm quarks in the medium has been neglected . according to refs .",
    "@xcite injected heavy quark suffers scatterings only with light flavors and gluons of the medium .",
    "but recent experimental evidences from alice and cms confirm the presence of thermalized charm quarks in the medium .",
    "according to the experimental evidences high @xmath1 @xmath0 are more suppressed than low @xmath1 @xmath0 with a strong centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "to explain the low @xmath1 @xmath0 nuclear modification factor , several models like the statistical hadronization model and the transport model have been involved  @xcite . in the transport model a dynamical competition between the @xmath0 suppression by the qgp and regeneration of the @xmath5 pairs",
    "occurs . within this model",
    "if charm quarks gets thermalized in the medium then formed @xmath0 can exhibit a large elliptic flow .",
    "in fact , pb - pb collisions at the lhc indeed favor the idea of charm quark thermalization in higher energy density in increasing the flow  @xcite .",
    "thus theory of heavy quark energy loss seeks modification in presence of thermalized @xmath5 pairs in the medium .",
    "we , in the current study develop a complete theoretical framework to evaluate the energy loss of an energetic heavy quark including all possible scatterings with the medium particles to the leading order in the qcd coupling constant .    in all the previous studies it has been established that in the medium the heavy flavor energy loss is plagued with infrared divergences . in the non - relativistic plasma , this can be removed with the help of the coulomb or electric interaction .",
    "however , the problem becomes nontrivial with the relativistic plasma where both the electric and the magnetic interactions are important . to circumvent the problem",
    ", the usual way is to implement braaten and yuan s prescription @xcite . in this prescription , one separates the integration into two domains with an arbitrary cut off momentum scale @xmath6 . in the domain of exchange of hard gluons , ( where , momentum ( @xmath7 ) transfer @xmath8 ) one uses a tree level propagator and in the region of soft transfer ( where @xmath9 ) hard thermal loop ( htl ) corrected propagator is required providing the necessary screening that cuts off the ir divergence at the debye scale @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that both the contributions from the hard as well as the soft sectors must be added together to cancel the intermediate momentum scale making the final result independent of this arbitrary cut - off scale  @xcite . in the current paper , we adopt the method of braaten and yuan to compute heavy quark energy loss .    the effects of running coupling has also been incorporated in the formalism . in finite temperature bath",
    "effective field theory uses running of the qcd coupling at very high temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the effect of the running of coupling has already been implemented to compute the heavy quark energy loss and high @xmath1 photon spectrum @xcite . in the current paper , we present the computation of heavy quark energy loss in the fixed coupling limit .",
    "this approximation is well justified since the coupling constant does not vary much in the range of probed momenta .",
    "next we exhibit the same derivation with the implementation of running of coupling constant .",
    "the motion of a heavy quark in qcd medium looks similar to that of a test particle in the plasma .",
    "hence , its motion can be described as a typical brownian motion problem where quarks are executing random walk in the medium .",
    "c@c@c@c@c    &    & & & + ( a ) & ( b ) & ( c ) & ( d ) & ( e )    kinematics of the test particle in the plasma is described by boltzmann equation . in the current scenario",
    "since there are no external force and inhomogeneity present in the system , boltzmann equation reduces to , = -[f_p ] .",
    "[ boltz_2 ] r.h.s of the above equation represents the collision integral . in the present paper",
    "we consider a high energy heavy ( @xmath12 ) quark of mass @xmath13 , energy @xmath14 and momentum @xmath15 propagating through a plasma consisting light quarks ( @xmath7 ) , gluons ( @xmath16 ) and charm quark in equilibrium at a temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the injected heavy quark has small fluctuating part ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) which vanishes suffering collisions with other particles of the medium . in the present work",
    "we are interested only in the @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) scattering processes .",

    "the thermal phase space here contains the information of elastic scattering processes ( fig.([fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "the form of the phase space changes with the nature of the scatterings . in case of",
    "heavy and light quark scatterings the possibility of back scatterings can be excluded whereas for the scatterings between two heavy quarks one has to consider back scatterings .",
    "details of phase - space factor for different processes will be discussed later in the present paper .    now , eq.([boltz_2 ] ) in the relaxation time approximation can be expressed as , = - [ f_p]=-f_p ( p ) .",
    "[ boltz_3 ] where @xmath25 can be recognized as the particle interaction rate , given by ( p)&= & [ psf](2)^4 ^4(p+k - p-k ) _ spin| m |^2 .",
    "[ damprate_term ] one obtains heavy quark energy loss ( @xmath26 ) by averaging over the interaction rate times the energy exchange per scattering and dividing by the velocity of the injected heavy quark , = d. [ e_loss_def ] the factor @xmath27 in eq.([e_loss_def ] ) is essential in making @xmath28 finite within resummation perturbation theory .",
    "the calculation of interaction rate mentioned in eq.([damprate_term ] ) , using tree level diagram suffers quadratic infrared divergence . whereas , in case of energy loss the extra @xmath27 factor softens the infrared divergence to only logarithmic .",
    "however , the resummed effective boson propagator makes @xmath29 to be only logarithmically divergent which in turn makes @xmath26 finite @xcite .",
    "the energy loss of a heavy - quark propagating through a hot quark - gluon plasma can be calculated either from the field theory approach or using effective kinetic theory . in the present paper",
    "we follow the latter one .    in order to have detailed discussion of charm quark energy loss",
    "it is necessary to have an idea of number of scattering centers present in the bath . from the last equation it is evident that to estimate energy loss one has to have the information about the interaction rate .",
    "now , it is well known that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the density of the plasma particles , @xmath32 is the collision cross section and @xmath33 is the velocity of the particle , which is equal to the velocity of light in case of relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "hence , increase in number of scattering centers increases energy loss . in the current analysis since we are interested in the contribution of scatterings between heavy quarks it would be worthwhile to calculate the number density of heavy quarks present in the medium .",
    "one calculates number density of charm quarks , light quarks and gluons present in the medium by the following formula @xcite , n_i=_0^ where , @xmath34 is the degeneracy factor , @xmath35 is the total energy of the particles ( @xmath36 ) . in table.([table_1 ] ) variation of number densities of the bath particles with temperature can be observed . from the table",
    "it is evident that at temperatures relevant to lhc energies heavy quark density in the bath is quite important along with light quarks and gluons . with the increase in temperature",
    "there is increase in number densities .",
    "hence , to construct a consistent formalism of heavy quark energy loss it is indeed necessary to incorporate the scatterings of injected parton with heavy quarks present in the bath . in the following section we compute the contribution of heavy quark scatterings to the total energy loss .",
    ".variation of number density of heavy quarks , light quarks and gluons with temperature [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      first , we compute the energy loss where the heavy quark interacts with the thermal heavy quarks of momentum @xmath38 . following eq.([e_loss_def ] )",
    "the explicit form of heavy quark energy loss turns out to be , [ lossdef ] ( -)_qqqq = _ p_k _ k ( 2)^4 ^4(p+k - p-k ) _ spins |m|^2 , [ orieqn ] where , @xmath39 is the exchanged energy in an elastic scattering and @xmath40 denotes @xmath41 .",
    "the above expression has been obtained by inserting the factor @xmath27 in eq.([damprate_term ] ) and multiplying by a factor of @xmath42 to consider both quark and anti - quark scatterings . in the phase space factor ( psf ) for the current process one has to consider the possibility of back scatterings .",

    "first we present the derivation of heavy quark energy loss in the soft regime defined earlier as @xmath46 .",
    "the soft contribution to the energy loss is evaluated in the region of phase space where the exchanged gluon has momentum of the order of @xmath10 . in this kinematical region ,",
    "the gluon propagator has to be modified using the hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummation method to incorporate the in - medium effects .",
    "we start our derivation from eq.([orieqn ] ) . using the 3-momentum delta function",
    "we eliminate the @xmath47 integral appearing in eq.([orieqn ] ) , d^3p^^(3)(p+k - p^-k^)=1 .",
    "next , we introduce an energy variable @xmath27 in the integrand of eq.([orieqn ] ) in the following way , ( e_p+e_k - e_p^-e_k^)=^_-(e_p - e_p^ -)(-e_k^+e_k)d .",
    "two delta functions of the energy variable can then be written as , ( e_p - e_p^-)&=&(-v_p.q- ) + ( -e_k^+e_k)&=&(-v_k.q+ ) , where , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . from now",

    "it is observed that the formalism has significant effect on the charm quark energy loss .",
    "it has also been observed that with the increase in temperature heavy quark energy loss by scattering with heavy quarks in the bath increases thereby enhancing the total energy loss .",
    "in addition , the heavy quark energy loss increases significantly under inclusion of running coupling .",
    "the observation is consistent with the nature of number densities of plasma particles with temperature .",
    "increase in temperature increases number densities of the bath particles which in turn increases interaction rate and charm quark energy loss as well .",
