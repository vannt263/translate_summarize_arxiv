    "in this article we will consider the polyhedra with identified faces and the spines of 3-manifolds .",
    "spines have been studied broadly by matveev , among other mathematicians , and their definition , as well as the main theorems concerning them , are available in @xcite .",
    "further results on spine theory can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a polyhedron with identified faces is a solid polyhedron with an even number of polygonal faces , such as a platonic or archimedean solid , in which every @xmath0-agonal face is identified with another @xmath0-agonal face in a nice way . among other things ,",
    "the identification of two faces has to match up vertices with vertices and edges with edges .",
    "also , the correspondence of the faces must be frontwards .",
    "this means that if two identified faces are oriented in an induced way by an arbitrary orientation of the polyhedron , then their identification must be orientation reversing .",
    "two types of spaces are yielded naturally by these polyhedra .",
    "the first one , the space produced by the polyhedron , consists of the space obtained by taking the polyhedron and gluing every face frontwards with the face to which it is identified .",
    "the second one , the scar of the polyhedron , is obtained by taking only the boundary of the polyhedron ( @xmath1 ) and performing the same gluing .",
    "polyhedra with identified faces are usefull in the study of 3-manifolds because these manifolds can be presented by polyhedra . more specifically , every closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold can be obtained as the space produced by some polyhedron , as it is asserted in theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "polyhedra with identified faces are fairly common objects in three - dimentional topology .",
    "the lens spaces , for example , are commonly presented by this kind of polyhedra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other examples are the dodecahedron which is the base for constructing the poincar s dodecahedral space , the fundamental domains of isometry groups of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the butterflies , developed and studied by hilden , montesinos , tejada , and toro ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the methods developed by montesinos in the study of 3-manifolds as coverings of @xmath4 branched over knots have also a close relation with polyhedra with identified faces ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some other results concerning this kind of polyhedra can be found in @xcite  and @xcite . however , the study of polyhedra on these works has been mostly lateral , and has been restricted to particular polyhedra or families of these . in spite of its broad applications , polyhedra with identified faces",
    "have been rarely defined in a general way or studied independently .",
    "this initiative has been undertaken by cannon , floyd , and parry ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and , from a rather different approach , by the author ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to establish the relation between the polyhedra with identified faces and the spines of 3-manifolds .",
    "this relation is very close since , as we will see , the spines of 3-manifolds can be presented in terms of polyhedra in very convenient ways .",
    "this allows us to use polyhedra to define spines and special spines in ways different from the classical one , providing tool in the study of spines .",
    "this presentation of spines through polyhedra is useful for several reasons . in the first place ,",
    "since any sphere or polyhedron can be seen as a compactified bidimensional euclidean space , polyhedra with identified faces provide bidimensional descriptions ( or diagrams ) of spines , being spines intrincated objects of higher dimensions .",
    "besides , complicated mofidications of spines inside the ambient manifolds can be translated into modifications of polyhedra which are very easy to perform ( see @xcite ) . also , since polyhedra",
    "are closely related to the presentation of manifolds as branched coverings of @xmath4 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , this work sets a connection between spines and such presentations . finally , since polyhedra can be frequently embedded on @xmath2 and @xmath3 nicely ( for example when they are fundamental domains , or when they are realized through andreev s theorem ) , the results proved here suggest the possibility to endow spines with some geometrical meaning .",
    "we can mention also that it has been pointed out by cannon , floyd , and parry that it is very difficult to obtain examples of polyhedra with identified faces that produce 3-manifolds instead of pseudomanifolds ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite we have already described a method for constructing virtually an unlimited amount of polyhedra that produce 3-manifolds .",
    "here we also approach the problem by identifying a broad family of polyhedra that always produce 3-manifolds ( theorem [ t2 ] ) .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in a first section of preliminary concepts",
    "we will introduce briefly the polyhedra with identified faces .",
    "a more complete treatment can be found in @xcite . in the second section",
    "we will show that the set of homogeneous bidimensional spines of closed , connected , orientable 3-manifolds , is exactly the set of scars of the polyhedra that produce such manifolds ( theorem [ t2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we will see that a spine of a 3-manifold @xmath5 can be seen as the scar of a polyhedron that produces that same manifold @xmath5 . in the third section",
    "we will define a type of polyhedra that we will call distinguished , and we will prove that the special spines are exactly the scars of the distinguished polyhedra ( theorem [ t3 ] ) . in the fourth section",
    "we will see that distinguished polyhedra are in fact a presentation of the closed , connected , orientable 3-manifolds ( theorem [ t5 ] ) . in the fifth section",
    "we will group the polyhedra into classes , that we will call alikeness classes , and we will prove the equivalence between the alikeness classes of polyhedra and the pairs of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold , and @xmath7 is a homogeneous bidimensional spine of @xmath5 ( theorem [ c1 ] ) . finally , in the sixth section , we will prove the equivalence between the distinguished polyhedra and the special spines ( theorem [ c1 ] ) , showing that every special spine can be thought as a distinguished polyhedron and vice versa , and that the presentation of the 3-manifolds by special spines ( or special thickenable pl polyhedra ) is equivalent to the presentation by distinguished polyhedra .",
    "we begin by fixing some definitions and notation .",
    "[ d1 ] let @xmath8 be a cw complex of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath8  is homogeneous if every cell of dimension less than @xmath0 is contained in the closure of a cell of higher dimension , and if for every cell @xmath9 of dimension less than @xmath10 , @xmath11 is connected .",
    "let us notice that a finite homogeneous cw complex of dimension @xmath0  can be seen in a natural way as a quotient space of @xmath12  @xmath0-dimensional closed balls , where @xmath12  is the number of @xmath0-dimensional cells in the complex .",
    "[ d2]we say that a topological space @xmath13 is a graph if it can be splitted into open cells in such a way that , if @xmath14 is the set of these cells , then @xmath15 is a homogeneous one - dimensional cw complex . in this case",
    "we also say that @xmath14 is a triangulation of @xmath13 .",
    "we call the zero - dimensional and one - dimensional cells of @xmath14 , respectiveley , the vertices and edges of @xmath13 .",
    "let us notice that this definition of graph allows what in graph theory is known as loops and multiple edges",
    ".    * notation . *",
    "[ n1]given a topological space @xmath16 , we denote the interior and closure of @xmath16 by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectiveley . besides , given an arbitrary natural number @xmath19 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the polygon in the complex plane whose vertices are the @xmath19-th roots of the unit .",
    "we understand @xmath21 as the unit disk with two vertices at 1 and -1 , and we understand @xmath22 similarily .",
    "we give now a formal definition of a polyhedron with identified faces .",
    "let @xmath23 be the closed three dimensional ball , @xmath13 a connected graph embedded on @xmath24 , and @xmath14 a triangulation of @xmath13 .",
    "then we call the terna @xmath25 a _ cell - divided ball_. the following lemma is intuitively clear .",
    "a proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ l1]let @xmath13 be as above .",
    "then @xmath26 is the union of a finite number of disjoint bidimensional open disks .",
    "let then @xmath25 be a cell - divided ball such that @xmath26 consist of @xmath12 disjoint open disks .",
    "we call the vertices and edges of @xmath13 respectiveley the _ vertices _ and _ edges _ of @xmath25 , and the clousures of the @xmath27 mentioned open disks the _ faces _ of @xmath28",
    ".    let us consider now a cell - divided ball @xmath29 with an even number of faces @xmath30 oriented in an induced way by an arbitrary orientation of @xmath23 . and additionally ,",
    "for each @xmath31 , let us consider @xmath20 with an arbitrary orientation .",
    "now , let us suppose that the @xmath32 faces of @xmath25 can be matched by pairs in such a way that , for each pair @xmath33 , there exist functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is some integer , that satisfy the following conditions :    * both @xmath37 and @xmath38 restricted @xmath39 are homeomorphisms@xmath40 * both @xmath37 and @xmath38 send vertices to vertices and edges to edges .",
    "* of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one preserves the orientation and the other reverses it . * both @xmath37 and @xmath38 , restricted to any single edge of @xmath41 , are pl .",
    "the fourth condition is licit because the edges of @xmath13 are , naturally , homeomorphic to line segments .",
    "we can set then fixed homeomorphisms from @xmath42 to each edge of @xmath13 ( and also to the two edges of @xmath21 and the single edge of @xmath22 ) , and think about these edges as pl polyhedra according to these parametrizations . this way , and",
    "since @xmath37 and @xmath38 send edges on edges , we can ask these functions to be pl on the edges of @xmath41 .",
    "now , under these conditions , given a pair of faces @xmath33 of @xmath25 , the functions @xmath37 y @xmath38 allow us to define a relation @xmath43 between @xmath44 and @xmath45 under the following rule : @xmath46 is related to @xmath47 if and only if there exists @xmath48 such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "taking for each pair of faces the respective relation constructed in this way we get a set of relations @xmath51 that we will call an _ identification scheme , _ for the cell - divided ball @xmath25",
    ". the notation @xmath52 will be recurrent .",
    "let us notice that every @xmath53 is one to one ( 1 - 1 ) on @xmath54 , and at most 2 - 1 or 1 - 2 on the edges of @xmath13 .",
    "in fact the relation @xmath53 identifies homeomorphically the interior of @xmath44 with that of @xmath45 .",
    "it also identifies homeomorphically the edges of @xmath44 with edges of @xmath45 .",
    "however , two edges of @xmath44 can eventually be identified with a single edge of @xmath45 , and vice versa .",
    "if @xmath25 is a cell divided ball and @xmath55 is an identification scheme for @xmath28 , we call the quadruple @xmath56 a _ polyhedron with identified faces_. throughout this article we will use the word polyhedron to refer to a polyhedron with identified faces , unless otherwise specified",
    ". it is worth to notice that there are cell - divided balls for which there does not exist any identification scheme , for example the balls with an odd number of faces .",
    "now , given a polyhedron @xmath57 , the orbits of the points of @xmath24 under @xmath55 induce an equivalence relation on @xmath24 , that we denote by @xmath58 and call the _ relation produced by the polyhedron _",
    "( @xmath58 is the smallest equivalence relation that contains the relation @xmath59 ) .",
    "also , we call the quotient space @xmath60 the _ space produced by the polyhedron_.    on the other hand , we have that the relations @xmath53 identify homeomorphically edges with edges . in this way it is possible to take , on the set of edges of @xmath57 , the orbit of a determined edge @xmath61 under the set of relations @xmath55 .",
    "these orbits are equivalence classes on the set of edges of the polyhedron . also",
    ", this orbits are cyclic , in the sense that @xmath62 form an orbit if and only if there are relations @xmath63 such that @xmath64 identifies @xmath65 with @xmath66 , @xmath67 identifies @xmath66 with @xmath68 , ... , and @xmath69 identifies @xmath70 with @xmath65 . furthermore , there are no other relations on @xmath71 other than @xmath63 identifying edges on @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , since relations @xmath53 identify vertices with vertices , the orbits of these vertices under @xmath55 induce equivlence classes on the set of vertices .",
    "then , given an edge @xmath61 and a vertex @xmath73 , we call the cardinal of the class of @xmath61 the _ cycle _ of @xmath61 , and the cardinal of the class of @xmath73 the _ order _ of @xmath73 .    at this point",
    "we have already a precise definition of a polyhedron with identified faces . however , to ease the later work we shall narrow the definition slightly further , as we will do now .",
    "[ d3]let @xmath16 be a topological space , and let @xmath74 and @xmath75 be two equivalence relations on @xmath16 .",
    "we say that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are alike if there exists an homeomorphism @xmath76  such that for every @xmath77 and @xmath78 in @xmath16 , @xmath79 if and only if @xmath80 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath74 and @xmath75 are alike , then @xmath81 defined by @xmath82 is an homeomorphism .",
    "let @xmath83 and @xmath84 be two polyhedra with identified faces . let us suppose that @xmath58 and @xmath85 are alike , and that there exists an homeomorphism @xmath86 as in definition [ d3 ] , such that @xmath87 .",
    "then on this case we say that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are _ essentially equal _ polyhedra . clearly , essentially equal polyhedra form equivalence classes on the set of polyhedra .",
    "besides , since @xmath88 is an homeomorphism that  preserves \" both the cell - divided structure and the identification scheme , we can assume simply that @xmath89 and @xmath90 . hence , two essentially equal polyhedra are always of the form @xmath83 and @xmath91 .",
    "let us consider now the following example .",
    "let @xmath56 be a polyhedron , and let @xmath92 be a class or orbit of edges on @xmath56 .",
    "then we can insert at the middle point of each @xmath93 a vertex @xmath94 , obtaining thus a new triangulation @xmath95 of @xmath13 , and a new polyhedron @xmath96 .",
    "let us notice then that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are equal in their topological aspects , and differ only because of some redundant vertices .",
    "this example insinuates , correctly , that even though triangulations of graphs play an important role in the definition of polyhedra , by determining the edges and vertices of the same , such triangulations are superfluous from a topological point of view .",
    "the fact is , as we will see , that essentially equal polyhedra are topologically identical , for which it is desirable to work only with simple class representatives .",
    "we will see now the construction of a standard representative for each class of essentially equal polyhedra .",
    "let @xmath13 be a graph and @xmath14 be a triangulation of @xmath13 .",
    "then , we say that a vertex of @xmath99 is _ topologically superfluous _ if it is adyacent to exactly two edges .",
    "let us consider now a polyhedron @xmath57 , and a vertex @xmath100 of @xmath25 .",
    "let us recall that every point in the orbit of @xmath100 is also a vertex .",
    "we say that @xmath100 is a _ needless _",
    "vertex in @xmath56  if the following conditions are satisfied :    * every point @xmath101 in the orbit of @xmath100is a topologically superfluous vertex of @xmath13 .",
    "* there does not exist an edge of @xmath14 whose endings belong both to the set @xmath102 .",
    "it is worth to mention , even when we are not interested in proving it , that ( 1 ) implies ( 2 ) as long as the space produced by @xmath56 is not a lens .",
    "now , let @xmath103 be the triangulation obtained by the removal of all the needless vertices of @xmath14 .",
    "we call @xmath103 the _ standard triangulation _ of @xmath57",
    ". the good definition of @xmath103 follows inmediately from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "also , we understand that by the elimination of each vertex , the two edges adyacent to it are merged into a single edge .",
    "it can be proved that if @xmath103 is the standard triangulation for @xmath57 , then @xmath104 is a well defined polyhedron .",
    "it is clearly seen thus that @xmath105 is essentially equal to @xmath57 .",
    "we call @xmath105 the _ standard polyhedron _ for @xmath57",
    ". it can be seen also that essentially equal polyhedra have the same standard polyhedron , for which we will also say that @xmath104 is the _ standard polyhedron _ for the class of @xmath57 ( more exactly , what we have is that if @xmath106 and @xmath91 are essentially equal polyhedra , and if @xmath107 and @xmath108 are their standard polyhedra , then there exists an homeomorphism @xmath109 as in definition [ d3 ] such that @xmath110 , and such that @xmath111 is a graph isomorphism )    from now on we will understand essentially equal polyhedra as the same polyhedron .",
    "for that reason , instead of working with the set of all polyhedra , we will work with the set of classes of essentially equal polyhedra , or equivalently , the set of standard polyhedra .",
    "we will narrow thus our definition of polyhedron with identified faces to include only standard polyhedra , that is , polyhedra without needless vertices .",
    "we will also use the following notation .",
    "let @xmath104 be the standard polyhedron for the class of a given polyhedron @xmath57 .",
    "such a class , and therefore its standard polyhedron , is determined uniquely by the graph @xmath13 and the identification scheme @xmath55 , so we can now denote @xmath105 simply by @xmath112 .",
    "we will adopt this notation from now on .",
    "we will finish this section by examining what kind of spaces are produced by polyhedra with identified faces .",
    "let @xmath16 be a compact , connected , second - countable hausdorff topological space that satisfies the following conditions :    * every point of @xmath16 , except perhaps a finite number , has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a three dimensional open ball .",
    "* if @xmath113 has not a neighborhood of this type , it has a neighborhood whose closure is homeomorphic to the cone of a connected sum of tori .    in this case",
    "we say that @xmath16 is a pseudomanifold of type _",
    "_ _ @xmath114 , and it can be seen that every pseudomanifold of this type is triangulable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we say then that @xmath16 is of type _ _  _ _ @xmath115 if it is orientable , and of type _ _  _ _ @xmath116 if it is not .",
    "those points of a pseudomanifold that do not have a neighborhood homeomorphic to a ball , if they exist , are called _",
    "singularities_. we state now a theorem that determines exactly which are the spaces produced by polyhedra with identified faces .",
    "we will not prove the theorem , whose proof can be found in @xcite .    [",
    "t1]the set of the spaces produced by polyhedra whith identified faces is exactely the set of pseudomanifolds of type @xmath115 .",
    "besides , if a polyhedron produces a pseudomanifold @xmath117 , and @xmath77 is a singularity of @xmath117 , then @xmath77 comes from the identification of vertices in the polyhedron .    in particular , since every closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold is trivially a pseudomanifold of type @xmath115 , we have that for every closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold there exists a polyhedron that produces it .",
    "also , no manifold of other kind can be produced by a polyhedron .",
    "given a polyhedron @xmath112 , we call the space @xmath118 the _ scar _ of the polyhedron",
    ". let us notice that the scar of a polyhedron is a subspace of the space produced by the same , for @xmath119 .",
    "besides , the scar of a polyhedron has a natural homogeneous bidimensional cw complex structure , where each cell is obtained in the following way .",
    "each pair of faces of the polyhedron yields an open @xmath120-cell or _ face _ in the scar , produced when the interior of the faces are glued together .",
    "similarily , each class of @xmath0 edges of cycle @xmath0 in the polyhedron yields an open @xmath121-cell or _ edge _ in the scar , produced when the @xmath0 edges are glued toguether becoming a single one . and finally , each class of @xmath19 vertices of order @xmath19 yields a @xmath122-cell or _ vertex _ on the scar in the same way .",
    "let us notice that , since many polyhedra can produce the same scar , the cw complex structure just defined depends on the choice of one of these polyhedra .",
    "leaving aside scars for a moment , let us recall that every spine of a 3-manifold is a cw complex ( for the definition and main properties of spines see @xcite ) .",
    "then we say that a spine is bidimensional if it is homeomorphic to a bidimensional cw complex .",
    "similarily we will say that a spine is homogneous if it is homeomorphic to a homogeneous cw complex .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove the following theorem , which establishes the equivalence between the scars of polyhedra that produce manifolds , and the spines of 3-manifolds that are homogeneous bidimensional cw complexes .",
    "[ t2]let @xmath5 be a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold , and @xmath123 .",

    "aditionally , we will define @xmath283 and @xmath284 as the images of @xmath266 and @xmath280 under @xmath53 ; and we will define @xmath285 and @xmath286 as the restrictions of @xmath53 to @xmath266 and @xmath280 respectively . finally , let us set @xmath287 , and @xmath288 . then , under these circumstances , @xmath289 is a polyhedron alike to @xmath112 , and we say that the first one is obtained from the second one by the _ insertion of an edge of cycle 2_.    we can state now the following lemma .",
    "[ l8]two polyhedra are alike if and only if one of them can be obtained from the other by insertion and remotion of edges of cycle 2 .",
    "_ proof_. the implication from right to left is obtained directly from the definition of insertion and remotion of edges of cycle 2 .",
    "let us see the other implication .",
    "let @xmath112 and @xmath250 be two polyhedra in the same alikeness class .",
    "then we can consider the graph @xmath290 in @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath290  is not connected , we can connect it by the insertion of an edge of cycle 2 and obtain a new graph @xmath291 .",
    "if @xmath290 is connected , we define @xmath291 simply by @xmath292 . since @xmath291 is connected , @xmath293 is a cell - divided ball . restricting the relation @xmath258 to each of the faces of @xmath293 we obtain relations @xmath294 , such that @xmath295 is an identification scheme for @xmath293 .",
    "hence , @xmath296 is a polyhedron in the alikeness class of @xmath248 and @xmath250 .",
    "let @xmath297 be the set of all the points @xmath298 , whose equivalence classes under @xmath58 have cardinal different from @xmath120 .",
    "let us see that @xmath297 is contained in @xmath299 . from the discussion of section 3 , about the shapes of the neighborhoods of the points in the scars , it follows that the points in the scar of @xmath248 coming from points in @xmath297 can not have neighborhoods ( on the same scar ) homeomorphic to disks , and therefore @xmath297 must be a subset of @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , that analysis reveals that @xmath297 is in fact a subgraph of @xmath13 . since @xmath258 ,",
    "by symmetry , @xmath297 must also be a subset of @xmath300 .",
    "thus , @xmath301 .",
    "the same argument shows that @xmath302 and that @xmath303 .",
    "since @xmath13 and @xmath300 are subgraphs of @xmath291 , we conclude that both @xmath112 and @xmath256 can be obtained from @xmath304 by the remotion of edges of cycle 2 , with which we have proven the lemma .",
    "let @xmath117 be a pseudomanifold of type @xmath115 , and let @xmath7 be an homogeneous bidimensional spine of @xmath117 .",
    "then we say that a polyhedron produces @xmath305 if the space that it produces is @xmath117 and its scar is @xmath7 .",
    "we are in a position now to prove the following theorem , that will be the main result of this section , and establishes the equivalence between the pairs of the form @xmath305 and the alikeness classes of polyhedra .",
    "[ t7]two polyhedra are alike if and only of they produce the same quotient space and the same scar .    _",
    "proof_. we already know that alike polyhedra produce the same space and the same scar ( lemma [ l7 ] ) .",
    "let us see now that if two polyhedra produce the same quotient space @xmath117 ,  and the same scar @xmath7 , then they are alike .",
    "the proof is based on the construction made in the proof of theorem [ t2 ] , to prove that every spine is the scar of some polyhedron .",
    "let us observe that given a triangulation @xmath14 of @xmath7 , the construction of such polyhedron , just as it was carried out in the proof of the theorem , leads to a unique polyhedron ; for which we can denote the same by @xmath306 .",
    "let us see first that the polyhedra obtained from @xmath117 and @xmath7 by this method starting from different triangulations are all alike .",
    "let us consider two triangulations @xmath8 and @xmath134 of @xmath7 , and let us take one more triangulation , @xmath307 , that be a common subdivision of @xmath8 and @xmath134",
    ". then @xmath308 can be obtained from both @xmath309 and @xmath310 by insertion of edges of cycle 2 , for which @xmath311 and @xmath312 are alike .",
    "now , let @xmath250 be an arbitrary polyhedron that produces @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "let us see that there exists a triangulation @xmath14 of @xmath7 for which @xmath250 and @xmath313 are alike . through the insertion of edges of cycle 2 in @xmath249 ,",
    "it is possible to obtain a polyhedron @xmath314 whose faces are all triangular . clearly @xmath315 induces a triangulation @xmath103 in @xmath7 , and it is easy to see that @xmath316 .",
    "thus , @xmath103 is a triangulation of @xmath7 such that @xmath317 and @xmath256 are alike .    in this way",
    "we have that if @xmath14 is a triangulation of @xmath7 , every polyhedron that produces @xmath5 and @xmath7 is alike to @xmath318 , which completes the proof .",
    "@xmath170    the following theorem establishes the equivalence between the pairs of the form @xmath6 ( where @xmath5 is a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold , and @xmath319 is a homogeneous bidimensional spine of @xmath5 ) and the alikeness classes of polyhedra that produce manifolds .",
    "[ c1]let @xmath5 be a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold , and suppose that @xmath7 is a homogeneous bidimensional spine of @xmath5 .",
    "then , there exists a unique alikeness class , such that all its polyhedra produce @xmath6 , and such that no other polyhedron produces @xmath6 .    _ proof_. it follows trivially from theorems [ t2 ] and [ t7 ] .",
    "in section 3 we established the relation between the special spines of 3-manifolds and the scars of distinguished polyhedra . in this last section , in light of the developments of the previous section , we will aim for a more direct relation between special spines and distinguished polyhedra .",
    "this will be acomplished in the main result of this section , which is given in theorem [ c2 ] , and establishes the equivalence between the distinguished polyhedra and the special spines of 3-manifolds ( or special thickenable pl polyhedra ) .    before stating this result we shall give some definitions .",
    "let @xmath176 be a polyhedron , and let @xmath297 be definied as in the proof of lemma [ l8 ] , that is , as the set of all points @xmath320 , whose equivalence classes under @xmath58 have cardinal different from @xmath120 .",
    "then @xmath297 is a subgraph of @xmath13 , as we saw in that proof .",
    "since @xmath297 is defined from @xmath58 and not from @xmath112 , we see that @xmath297 only depends on the alikeness class of @xmath248 .",
    "we call @xmath297 the _ essential graph _ of the class of @xmath112 .",
    "let us notice that @xmath297 does not necessarily have to be connected or non - empty , though it can be proven that it is empty only in the case of a certain polyhedron for the projective space .",
    "let us observe that if @xmath297 is connected and non - empty , @xmath321 is by definition a cell - divided ball .",
    "moreover , the restrictions of @xmath58 to each of the faces of @xmath321 produce an identification scheme @xmath322 for @xmath323 , such that @xmath324 .",
    "thus , if @xmath297 is connected and non - empty , @xmath325 is a well defined polyhedron .",
    "we call @xmath326 the _ minimum polyhedron _ of the class of @xmath112",
    ".    now , let @xmath297 be the essential graph ( connected and non - empty ) of some alikeness class @xmath186 , and let @xmath112 be a class representative for @xmath186 . then , the analysis of neighborhoods of section 3 reveals that @xmath297 , besides being a subgraph of @xmath13 , is the union of the closures of all the edges of @xmath13 with cycle different from 2 .",
    "hence , @xmath325 is the polyhedron obtained by succesively removing all the edges of cycle 2 from @xmath176 .",
    "the arbitrariness of @xmath176 implies that we have proven the following lemma .",
    "[ l9]if @xmath325 is the minimum polyhedron of an alikeness class @xmath186 , with @xmath297 connected and non - empty , then every polyhedron in @xmath186 is obtained from @xmath327 by the insertion of edges of cycle 2 .",
    "[ t8]every distinguished polyhedron produces a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold , and its scar is a special spine of that manifold . inversely ,",
    "if @xmath5 is a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold and @xmath7 is a special spine of @xmath5 , then there exists a unique distinguished polyhedron that produces @xmath5 and whose scar is @xmath7 .",

    "the closedness , connectedness and orientability are implied by theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "let us prove now the other affirmation .",
    "let @xmath5 be a ( closed , connected , orientable ) 3-manifold and @xmath7 a special spine of @xmath328 .",

    "on the other hand we have , by theorem [ c1 ] , that there exists a unique alikeness class @xmath186 whose polyhedra produce @xmath6 .",
    "from there it follows that @xmath112 belongs to @xmath186 .",
    "the theorem will be proven if we show that @xmath248 is the only distinguished polyhedron in @xmath186 .",
    "now , we know that @xmath112 , for being distinguished , lacks edges of cycle 2 . since the essential graph of @xmath186 is the union of the closures of all the edges of @xmath13 with cycle different from 2 , we have that @xmath13 is the essential graph of @xmath186 .",
    "hence , since @xmath112 is a well defined polyhedron , @xmath13 is connected and non - empty , and @xmath248 is the minimum polyhedron of @xmath186 .",
    "from there it follows that every polyhedron in @xmath186 is obtained from @xmath248 by the insertion of edges of cycle 2 ( lemma [ l9 ] ) , and that @xmath112 is the only distinguished polyhedron in @xmath186 .",
    "@xmath170      _ proof_. the first affirmation holds by theorem [ t4 ] .",
    "let us see the other affirmation .",
    "let @xmath7 be a special spine of some closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold .",
    "since @xmath7 is special , that 3-manifold is unique , and we can denote it by @xmath329 . by the previous theorem ( theorem [ t8 ] ) , there exists a unique distinguished polyhedron that produces @xmath330 .",
    "from there it follows that there exists a unique distinguished polyhedron that produces @xmath7 . @xmath170    the previous theorem , which is the main result of this section , establishes a one to one correspondence between the distinguished polyhedra and the special spines , in which each polyhedron produces its corresponding spine .",
    "it is a consecuence of the same theorem and theorem [ t3 ] that , for every distinguished polyhedron , it and its corresponding special spine present one and the same 3-manifold .",
    "we conclude then that the presentations of 3-manifolds by distinguished polyhedra and special spines are in fact equivalent .",
