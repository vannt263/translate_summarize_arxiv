    "then there is an effective @xmath8dimensional extended object in the six dimensions .",
    "it is in fact a bps solution , and there are eight supercharges preserved by this situation .",
    "furthermore , there is an @xmath1 pure gauge theory with eight supercharges on the @xmath9dimensional world volume of the bps soliton .",
    "this soliton has a description as a bound state of the wrapped brane and a negatively charged d@xmath8brane@xcite .",
    "we shall refer to this as the d@xmath6d@xmath10 system , where the asterisk ( @xmath11 ) is to remind us that this is not an ordinary d@xmath8 brane , since that would be an instanton .",
    "let us focus on @xmath12 , hence studying type  iia .",
    "the supergravity theory contains twenty  four @xmath13 s coming from the various r - r potentials in the theory . of these , twenty ",
    "two come from wrapping the two ",
    "form on the 19 + 3 two  cycles of @xmath7 .",
    "the remaining two are special @xmath13 s for our purposes : one of them arises from wrapping the five  form entirely on @xmath7 , while the final one is simply the plain one ",
    "form already present in the uncompactified theory .",
    "in fact , the bps soliton is actually a monopole of one of the six dimensional @xmath13 s .",
    "it is obvious which @xmath13 this is ; the diagonal combination of the two special ones we mentioned above .",
    "actually , we can simply ignore the 2 spatial directions in which the soliton is extended and see that the monopole sector ( recall that it is also coupled to gravity ) is nothing more than the usual problem of monopoles@xcite in a 3 + 1 dimensional gauge theory with an adjoint higgs .",

    "the @xmath3 is spontaneously broken to @xmath13 , by the higgs vacuum expectation value ( `` vev '' ) @xmath20 , whose magnetic charge the monopoles carry .",
    "for orientation , and for later use , the explicitly known fields of the one monopole solution is@xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 note that it is spherically symmetric and has been normalized ( for later use ) such that @xmath24 , as @xmath25 , with unit magnetic charge .    where did the @xmath3 come from ? when the @xmath7 s volume reaches the value @xmath26 , our @xmath13 is enhanced to @xmath3 . this is a stringy phenomenon which has no description in supergravity , since ( for example ) the w  bosons for this @xmath3 are made of wrapped d4branes .",
    "this is an interesting system to use to study@xcite the large  @xmath0 limit of the @xmath5 @xmath1 gauge theory along the lines of recent ideas such as those in ref.@xcite . a large number of these d6d2 * objects give a supergravity solution , which might be expected to encode ( at least ) some of the large  @xmath0 physics .",
    "interestingly , the supergravity solution which one naively writes down suffers from a naked singularity known as a `` repulson''@xcite which is unphysical , and incompatible with the physics of the gauge theory .",
    "one expects that there should be a sensible supergravity solution , valid for @xmath27 large , where @xmath28 is the string coupling .    in fact@xcite",
    "the repulson is not present , since it represents supergravity s best attempt to construct a solution with the correct asymptotic charges . in the solution ( not displayed here since we will not need it ; see ref.@xcite ) , the volume of the @xmath7 , set to @xmath4 asymptotically , actually decreases as one approaches the core of the configuration . at the centre ,",
    "the @xmath7 radius is zero , and this is the singularity .",
    "this ignores rather interesting physics , however . at a finite distance from the putative singularity",
    ", the volume of the @xmath7 gets to @xmath29 , so the stringy phenomena including new massless fields giving the enhanced @xmath3 should have played a role .",
    "so the aspects of the supergravity solution near and inside the special radius , called the `` enhanon radius '' , should not be taken seriously at all , since it ignored this stringy physics .",
    "to a first approximation , the supergravity solution should only be taken as physical down to the enhanon radius @xmath30 . that locus of points , a two ",
    "sphere @xmath31 , is itself called an `` enhanon '' .",
    "it deserves a name , and to be considered as an object in its own right , since d6d2 * objects probing this geometry seem to spread out or smear onto it as they approach it , losing their identity ( see ref.@xcite and later in this paper ) . in this way , we see that the enhanon is a hypersurface apparently made of branes which have puffed up into a sphere .",
    "there is a natural generalization of this all to situations involving branes of different dimensions , ( with the enhanon a sphere of different dimensionality ) , and including orientifolds .",
    "this pertains to @xmath1 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 gauge theories with eight supercharges in various dimensions@xcite .      in the rest of this paper",
    "we will uncover many new properties of the enhanon pertaining to the 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "many of the generic features will have meaning in other dimensions and for other gauge groups .",
    "we will obtain detailed information because we can exploit the connection@xcite to the classical physics of monopoles .",
    "the relevant properties of the enhanon already alluded to so far are reviewed in the next section , and the details that we will need are emphasized , including the perturbative expression for the metric on the spacetime geometry as seen by a probe brane .",
    "section  [ ah ] shows that a number of ( metric ) geometrical details of the enhanon can be learned from the observation that the full non  perturbative spacetime geometry ( as seen by the probe in the decoupling limit @xmath35 ) can be deduced from the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold@xcite , and appropriate generalisations thereof , which we conjecture to exist as an ade family .",
    "section  [ mono ] focuses on the description of the system of @xmath0 monopoles _ via _ nahm data@xcite .",
    "the point is simply that the since the description of the @xmath0 coincident d6d2 * branes carrying the @xmath1 is as classical monopoles , we ought to learn more about them by studying the well  established technology for describing multi  monopoles . in this way",
    ", we see that there is some essential non  commutativity in the description , and we exploit this in section  [ fuzz ] to show that the enhanon is actually a `` fuzzy '' or non  commutative sphere@xcite .",
    "this makes contact with the `` dielectric brane '' construction of myers@xcite , and we discuss the similarities and differences between the two cases .",
    "figure  [ substringy ] is a summary of some of the properties of the geometry .",
    "finally , in section  [ candidate ] we make a tentative but contentful conjecture about a possible stringy dual description of the 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory at large @xmath0 .",
    "it is motivated by the fact that the part of the supergravity geometry which can be written , in the decoupling limit , entirely in terms of gauge theory quantities ( after referral to the `` frame '' of a monopole probe ) is a part of monopole moduli space .",
    "it is suggested that the nahm data ( a family of @xmath36 matrices depending upon a single coordinate ) might be used at large  @xmath0 to describe a matrix string theory with many of the properties needed for a stringy dual .",
    "the construction of the string is likely quite analogous to the more familiar matrix strings , but this new string theory inherits rich properties of the monopole physics , since it is built out of nahm data .",
    "further work is needed on this proposal .",
    "we close with an added note on other work .",
    "in fact , the phenomenology of the enhanon in supergravity is consistent with the monopole physics and with the physics of the 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory at large  @xmath0 .",
    "the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua of the theory is parameterized by the vevs of the three adjoint scalars @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) in the vector  multiplet .",
    "this is @xmath39 dimensional , since they generically live in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group when satisfying this condition . at a generic point on this space ,",
    "the gauge symmetry is therefore @xmath40 , ( hence the name `` coulomb branch '' ) and these abelian gauge fields may be dualized to give @xmath41 more scalars .",
    "the moduli space is therefore @xmath42 dimensional .",
    "the complete , quantum corrected moduli space is a smooth hyperkhler manifold , given that there are eight supercharges . in fact@xcite ,",
    "the moduli space@xcite is that of @xmath0 bps monopoles .    in the probe computation of ref.@xcite ,",
    "a single d6d2 * object was used to probe all of the others , in order to investigate how the geometry looks from its point of view . as moving the probe slowly in the background of its siblings",
    "is a bps process , there should be no potential in the effective lagrangian for this procedure , and only kinetic terms . from these terms",
    "may be read the metric of spacetime as seen by the probe@xcite .",
    "the result of the computation is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the volume of @xmath7 is @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the harmonic functions appearing in the supergravity solution , which we do not display here .",
    "the basic d6 and d2brane charges are@xcite @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "notice that the metric ( [ fourth ] ) is singular where the monopole s mass per unit volume , @xmath51 vanishes , which is at @xmath52 this happens at the `` enhanon '' radius @xmath53 this is consistent with the fact that a monopole s mass is set by the value of the higgs , while its size is inversely proportional to it .",
    "so as @xmath54 approaches zero at @xmath55 , a monopole probe becomes smeared out as it merges into all the other monopoles at the core .",
    "the departure from a sharp description as a heavy point ",
    "like object the smearing is signaled in the kinetic energy s divergence .    since the monopoles can not go to @xmath56 in the supergravity geometry in a supersymmetric way@xcite consistent with the gauge dynamics and common sense , it is sensible to conclude that there is simply new geometry and physics in that region , as anticipated in the supergravity discussion of the previous section .",
    "perhaps we can learn more about the enhanon by a closer study of the gauge theory , and hence the monopole physics .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath1 gauge theory is given by @xmath57 to isolate the gauge theory , it is prudent to focus on the limit where we attempt a decoupling limit by sending @xmath35 , holding the coupling and @xmath58 finite@xcite . in this case , the metric becomes @xmath59 the @xmath13 monopole potential is @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this metric is meaningful only for @xmath62 .",
    "it is the euclidean taub ",
    "nut metric , with a negative mass .",
    "it is a hyperkhler manifold , because @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "it is intriguing to note@xcite ( and we shall try to exploit this more fully later ) that only the gauge theory quantities @xmath65 ( a characteristic energy scale ) and @xmath66 ( the t hooft coupling ) survive the limit , while all other details of the supergravity have disappeared .",
    "the enhanon is at @xmath67 .",
    "a crucial point which can be read off from this geometry is that the enhanon appears as the one  loop correction to the gauge coupling , representing the landau pole .",
    "there are instanton corrections to this ( and hence to the manifold ) , smoothing out the singular nature at the enhanon .",
    "the expectation was expressed in ref.@xcite that this manifold is would be thereby corrected to an atiyah ",
    " like manifold , and we shall see that this is true presently .    from the point of view of the monopole description , this manifold should be related to the metric on the moduli space of monopoles .",
    "it is clearly a submanifold of the full @xmath68 dimensional metric on what is known as the `` strongly centered '' moduli space of @xmath0 bps monopoles .",
    "precisely which submanifold we have here should be of interest to us .",
    "first observe that we can change variables in our probe metric ( [ probe ] ) by absorbing a factor of @xmath69 into the radial variable @xmath65 , defining @xmath70 .",
    "further absorb @xmath71 and gauge transform to @xmath72 .",
    "then we get : @xmath73 the latter is precisely the form of the taub ",
    "nut metric that one gets by expanding the atiyah ",
    "hitchin metric in large  @xmath74 and neglecting the exponential corrections .    for the case of @xmath75 , the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold is the full non  perturbative result for the moduli space of the @xmath3 gauge theory@xcite .",
    "in fact for this manifold , written in these coordinates , the periodicity of @xmath76 is @xmath77 ( see later ) and so the @xmath3 isometry of the taub  nut manifold is broken to @xmath78 by the exponential corrections .",
    "the quotientied sphere @xmath79 at infinity is an orbit under this .    in unscled coordinate of the @xmath13 probe gauge theory ,",
    "this means that the quantity @xmath80 is the @xmath77 periodic dual scalar to the photon .",
    "_ this periodicity is independent of @xmath0 . _ therefore , for arbitrary @xmath0 , the periodicity of @xmath76 is @xmath81 .",
    "this allows us to characterise the manifolds we need for all  @xmath0 :    they have only _ local _ @xmath82 action , and globally the isometry is broken and we have only the action of @xmath83 .",
    "the manifolds are therefore asymptotically the negative mass taub  nut , and",
    "the space at infinity is an @xmath84 .",
    "we will characterise the form of the exponential corrections for arbitrary @xmath0 in the next section .",
    "so this is our first set of information that we learn by studying the monopole physics : the exponential corrections to our manifold ( as seen by the probe ) and hence information about the neighbourhood and interior of the enhanon geometry are of the same form as those for the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold ( with a generalisation we shall characterise shortly ) .",
    "this is remarkably fortuitous , and will teach us more presently . for definiteness ,",
    "let us display the full atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold@xcite : @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the elliptic integral of the first kind : @xmath87 also , @xmath88 , the `` modulus '' , runs from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , so @xmath91 .",
    "the difference between this and negative mass taub ",
    "nut  ( [ taubnut ] ) at large  @xmath74 is exponential , _",
    "i.e. , _ of the form @xmath92 . in the case of @xmath3 gauge theory ( @xmath75 ) , this translates ( using the formulae above  ( [ taubnut ] ) into precisely the right form to be instanton corrections @xmath93 , and this has been proven to be the correct interpretation from a number of points of view@xcite .    for @xmath1",
    ", we expect instantons in the field theory to have essentially the same action , and so this translates into a set of exponential corrections of the form @xmath94 .",
    "so for large  @xmath0 therefore , the corrections to the taub  nut manifold are quite small , but the instantons smooth it out on a small enough scale nonetheless .",
    "( this smallness of the intanton corrections to @xmath95 @xmath1 gauge theory moduli space at large  @xmath0 has been noticed in other contexts , _",
    "e.g. _ in ref.@xcite . )",
    "so in short , our fully corrected moduli space , which also contains information about the spacetime geometry , is given by a family of manifolds naturally generalising the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold , after rescaling @xmath74 , and @xmath76",
    ". it would be interesting to characterise these manifolds further .",
    "one expects them to be smooth , or at least to contain @xmath96 parameters which allow them to be deformed to a neighbouring smooth manifold for the simple reason that the gauge theory moduli space , not having a higgs branch to connect to , is expected to be smooth .",
    "there is a concern that this is only true for the full @xmath97 dimensional manifold representing the moduli space , and that a restriction to a 4 dimensional submanifold can introduce singularities .",
    "this is where the @xmath96 deformation parameters come in , as they represent the frozen moduli of the other monopoles / vacua , now entering as parameters in the reduced theory ; intuitively , one expects the process of a single monopole merging with @xmath0 others to be smooth , or at least smoothable by moving the others around .",
    "it is now worth reminding ourselves about the physics of the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold , using it as a prototype for our case involving general @xmath0 .",
    "the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold@xcite is the metric on the strongly centred moduli space of two bps monopoles .",
    "in fact , the two monopole solution itself ( _ i.e. _ ,  the gauge and higgs fields ) is not spherically symmetric monopole solution@xcite , as we shall discuss . ] .",
    "at best , it is axisymmetric , and this is when the two monopoles are coincident .",
    "the coordinate @xmath74 represents the asymptotic separation of the monopoles .",
    "it really only has this meaning when the monopoles are separated quite far apart , and then the metric reduces to @xmath98 .",
    "closer than this , the monopoles cease to be distinct . actually , the singularity at @xmath99 in the taub ",
    "nut metric is completely meaningless , as it is well outside the range of validity of the large  @xmath74 expansion used to get that metric . further proof of this comes from the fact that the monopoles are coincident at @xmath100 .",
    "this special ( axisymmetric ) solution@xcite has monopole charge 2 , and really has no sensible description in terms of individual monopoles at all .",
    "generically , all we can say ( this can be confirmed by a study of the location of the zeros of the higgs field part of the monopole solution@xcite ) is that for any @xmath74 the monopoles are spaced symmetrically along an axis , which we can choose to be the @xmath101 axis .",
    "the higgs field has zeros even when the monopoles cease to have any sensible meaning ( since they grow large and diffuse ) , and are often used as a guide to the `` location '' of the monopoles , despite their finite coresize . when @xmath100 , the two higgs zeros are both at the origin , and this is the coincident case .",
    "note that despite the fact that the solution is axisymmetric , far away from it , in spacetime ( @xmath25 ) , the higgs field is @xmath102=h-{ne_{\\rm m}\\over r}+\\cdots \\label{higgs}\\ ] ] for ( here ) @xmath75 , and this form of the higgs is generally true for all @xmath0 .",
    "here @xmath103 is the basic unit of magnetic charge , dirac fixed in terms of the electric charge @xmath104 .",
    "actually , the metric components in the neighbourhood of @xmath100 are@xcite : @xmath105 and so the metric appears to be singular there , given that @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath107 of @xmath108 collapses to a two  sphere , @xmath2 , there , but this point is actually a coordinate `` bolt '' singularity .",
    "it is the removal of this bolt which requires @xmath76 to be @xmath77 periodic , a fact which featured in the previous two subsections .",
    "it should be noted that we have only described a simple cover of the moduli space of two monopoles .",
    "there is an addition @xmath109 which identifies configurations which correspond to each other after an exchange of the ( identical ) monopoles . in this way",
    "the bolt becomes an @xmath110 instead of an @xmath2 .",
    "we will not have such a symmetry here , so our bolt ( or generalisation thereof ) , for @xmath111 will always be an  @xmath2 .",
    "how are we to make sense of the appearance of the atiyah  hitchin  like manifolds in our case , and what can we learn about spacetime physics ?",
    "well , we have a four dimensional submanifold of the full metric on moduli space , and so most of the parameters ( @xmath112 of them ) have been fixed . in ref.@xcite",
    "all of the branes were placed at the origin @xmath113 in the supergravity discussion .",
    "so all of the parameters were frozen except the single probe brane s position and phase .",
    "although in supergravity they are naively at @xmath113 , this is not the case , and they are smeared out into a sphere of radius @xmath114 .    now , the atiyah  hitchin coordinate @xmath74 should have an interpretation as a separation from the center of mass .",
    "for the 2monopole case that would tell us very little about the spacetime geometry , but since we have @xmath0 monopoles , and @xmath0 is large , @xmath115 is a good radial coordinate for spacetime , as the center of mass is still close to @xmath116 when only one probe is separated off .",
    "_ this is why at large  @xmath0 our scaled atiyah  hitchin ",
    "like manifold has a dual meaning as a relative moduli space for monopoles as well as the spacetime geometry seen by the probe .",
    "_ for small @xmath0 , the coordinate @xmath65 is not as good a guide to the spacetime geometry .",
    "note that for any @xmath0 , the spacetime higgs field will asymptotically behave as in equation  ( [ higgs ] ) .",
    "this is why the supergravity solution can be spherically symmetric , as its asymptotically spherically symmetric geometry matches on to this behaviour , while the deviation from spherical symmetry is a detail only visible in terms subleading in large  @xmath0 .",
    "taking the expression for the volume @xmath117 and expanding gives : @xmath118 confirming the earlier statement about the relation between the volume and the higgs field , and fixing @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "( later , we will set @xmath121 and hence @xmath122 , since we are free to choose these parameters at our convenience .",
    "note that the explicit one  monopole solution displayed in eqn.([one ] ) is so normalized , and has @xmath123 set to 1 . )    taking seriously the other lessons learned from the two monopole case , the analogue of the bolt sphere at @xmath100 is where the probe merges into all the other branes . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "the correction from @xmath99 to the bolt radius is significant , while for large  @xmath0 , as we have seen , the instanton corrections are small . inside the bolt radius",
    "there is really no meaning to the coordinate @xmath74 as having anything to do with distinct monopoles .",
    "in fact , this is very robust : scattering two identical monopoles using the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold shows that @xmath100 is truly the distance of closest approach : a head  on collision results in a @xmath124 scattering angle at @xmath100 .",
    "the finite core size of the monopoles takes over .",
    "we inherit this qualitative behaviour here for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "so in fact we learn that there is indeed a sharp meaning to the sphere of closest approach for the monopoles .",
    "it is also where they become massless , and also become indistinct .",
    "it is precisely where there occurs a bolt _ coordinate _ singularity in the _ smooth _ atiyah  hitchin manifold .",
    "the radii @xmath125 ( or @xmath126 ) do not have any meaning for the individual monopole probes .",
    "in brane / supergravity language , we naively placed the branes all at the same place ( @xmath113 ) , at the point of @xmath1 symmetry , the origin of the coulomb branch . as we know from other examples@xcite , quantum corrections in the gauge theory alter the structure of that point .",
    "in fact , the enhanon is precisely a manifestation of this , since the monopoles are really not at the origin , but smeared into a sphere .",
    "one of the crucial points of the present investigation is that the entire physics of the moduli space of the gauge theory is given in terms of the _ classical _ bps monopoles , and so we should look no further than that system in order to learn more about the enhanon , and what it means .",
    "so how does one describe a clump of @xmath0 monopoles ?",
    "charge @xmath0 multi  monopoles generalising the charge 1 bps solution@xcite were constructed by a number of elegant techniques . on the one hand ,",
    "algebraic techniques@xcite were employed by ward@xcite , with generalisations@xcite ; on the other hand , a connection@xcite to bcklund transformations and inverse scattering techniques was employed in refs.@xcite .",
    "since the bogomolnyi equations ( [ bogomolnyi ] ) are related by dimensional reduction to the self  dual equations in four euclidean dimensions , there is another elegant description _ via _ an extension of the adhm construction@xcite . the basic ( `` covariant '' nahm ) equations are : @xmath127= { 1\\over 2}\\epsilon_{ijk}[\\phi^j,\\phi^k]\\ , \\label{nahm}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 run over @xmath129 .",
    "here , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are @xmath36 anti ",
    "hermitian @xmath1 matrices , with @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath134 has range @xmath135 , where @xmath20 is the asymptotic value of the higgs field , which we shall presently set to 1 in much of the rest of this paper .",
    "the data appropriate to monopoles arise as solutions to this equation which are regular in the interior of @xmath136 $ ] , with appropriate boundary conditions at @xmath137 .",
    "those boundary conditions require that @xmath37 have simple poles there , and that the residues of those poles ( which are of course @xmath36 matrices ) are irreducible representations of @xmath3 .",
    "there is an @xmath1 gauge invariance , @xmath138 where the @xmath139 , and are the identity at the ends of the interval .",
    "there is a specific construction ( also following the adhm techniques ) for converting the solutions of these equations the `` nahm data'' into expressions for the spacetime fields @xmath140 , @xmath141 , which we shall not reproduce here since for @xmath142 , closed forms are not known .",
    "hitchin@xcite has shown using algebraic methods that this method constructs all of the monopole solutions and indeed that it is equivalent to the aforementioned monopole constructions based on those of ward@xcite .",
    "the gauge transformations ( [ gauge ] ) can be used to set @xmath143 to zero , giving the standard nahm equations , but should be left unfixed in order to perform the full hyperkhler quotient@xcite which constructs the metric on the moduli space of nahm data .",
    "nakajima@xcite has shown that the metric thus computed is indeed the monopole moduli space , and it is smooth .",
    "this nahm system arises naturally in the brane description as the condition on the brane fields for supersymmetric vacua , resulting in a hyperkhler quotient .",
    "the @xmath144 are adjoint scalars in a gauge theory on the brane . the most natural brane system where this arises is probably that of@xcite @xmath0 d1branes stretched perpendicularly between two d3branes separated by a distance  @xmath145 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath134 is that along the d1branes , and the @xmath144 are the positions of the d1branes inside the d3branes .",
    "the boundary conditions arise by considering the 1 + 1 dimensional theory on the world  volume as a theory with `` impurities '' located at @xmath137 , which is natural , since the massless 13 strings are localized there@xcite .",
    "these nahm equations can also be derived in the brane wrapped on @xmath7 system we started with here .",

    "the coordinate @xmath134 is the coordinate between the ns5brane .",
    "the 5 + 1 dimensional theory on the ns5branes is the spontaneously broken 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath3 theory if we ignore the two spatial directions common to both the branes@xcite .",
    "translating further , there is a factor of @xmath151 in front of the commutator in the nahm equation .",
    "( this is instead of @xmath28 , appropriate to the case of d1branes ending on d3branes . )",
    "there is a `` double trumpet '' shape describing the @xmath0 stretched d3branes pulling on the ns5branes , as depicted in ref.@xcite and reproduced in figure  [ trumpet ] .    at the centre of the shape",
    ", there is a two  sphere where the fivebranes touch , restoring the @xmath3 .",
    "crucially , this is only a two  sphere for @xmath0 large enough , since the radius of the sphere is proportional to @xmath0 , and only for spheres large enough are we far enough away from the details of the interior of the multi  monopole configuration to see an approximately spherically symmetric situation .",
    "( recall that the multi ",
    "monopole is not spherically symmetric@xcite . )",
    "we can make this a bit more precise as follows : first note that in the one  monopole case , the solution is spherically symmetric , and the nahm data is simply the one dimensional representation of @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. , _ all the @xmath152 are equal .",
    "assume that in our case , we are far away enough from the core that we can borrow this behaviour , making the symmetric choice @xmath153 . in doing this , we connect to the discussion of ref.@xcite .",
    "there , this was shown to correspond to an infinite trumpet shape representing @xmath0 d1branes merging into an orthogonal d3brane .",
    "the required poles at the ends of the nahm interval correspond to the flaring of the trumpet as it expands into the perpendicular shape .",
    "the nahm equations become : @xmath154 and the solution we seek here is made by gluing together two copies of the trumpet end to end at the centre of the interval : @xmath155$}\\ .\\ ] ] this gives a shape like that in figure [ trumpet ] , but is only an approximation .",
    "the full solution should connect smoothly through the interior of the interval .",
    "a cross section at some value of @xmath134 is a non  commutative , or `` fuzzy '' sphere@xcite of radius given by ( remembering to put in the factor of @xmath149 for dimensions ) @xmath156 there is a minimum value , @xmath157 where the ns5branes touch at @xmath158 .",
    "there , the radius is @xmath159 which compares well with the supergravity expression ( [ enhanced ] ) for the enhanon radius , which is @xmath160 this particular fuzzy sphere is the enhanon .",
    "it is a sensible smooth sphere of non  zero radius at large  @xmath0 .",
    "notice also that it has roughly the correct behaviour for the @xmath0 monopole size in terms of the higgs vev @xmath20 and the electric charge @xmath104 .    for small @xmath0 ( @xmath161 )",
    "it is very non  spherical , while it collapses to zero size in the case @xmath162 : the minimum value @xmath163 is zero for a single monopole , and the double trumpet profile pinches off , as can be deduced ( see ref.@xcite ) from a study of the higgs field ( [ one ] ) for the explicitly known one  monopole solution .",
    "we plot this in figure  [ single ] .    returning to large  @xmath0 , it is in this sense that we see the connection between the dielectric brane construction of ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) ( where branes puff up into a sphere in the presence of a background r ",
    "r field ) and the enhanon .",
    "both phenomena can be used as examples of a new mechanism for excising undesirable spacetime singularities@xcite , but the dielectric mechanism is adapted to @xmath164 supersymmetry preserving vacua@xcite , while here we have @xmath5 ( counting in four dimensional units ) .",
    "the connection between the two is simply that there are non  zero commutators for the adjoint scalars ( forming  @xmath0dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath3 ) which have been shown in one case@xcite to induce multipole couplings to higher rank r ",
    "this is equivalent to the growth of extra dimensions on the brane .    in the present case ,",
    "the nahm equations are the means by which non  zero commutators arise in an @xmath5 supersymmetry preserving way .",
    "the higher dimensional aspect of the branes is realized in terms of their description as a finite sized multi ",
    "monopole configuration .",
    "the non  commutative sphere which is the enhanon is a preferred slice through this geometry , forming the effective shell around the @xmath0monopole core .",
    "one of the goals of a study of the supergravity solution mentioned in the introduction was to see if there is a large  @xmath0 dual supergravity solution .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , even with the improved understanding of the geometry by recognizing the role of the enhanon , the decoupling / scaling limit @xmath35 ( with @xmath165 finite ) gives a ten dimensional supergravity solution which was not appropriate as a truly decoupled dual theory .",
    "one sign of this ( among others ) is the simple fact that the resulting geometry contained parameters which recalled the original data of the type  iia compactification . in other words",
    ", it did not assemble into an expression referring purely to gauge theory quantities , as happens in simpler cases where there is a genuine supergravity dual@xcite .",
    "it would certainly be an excellent situation if there was a large  @xmath0 dual theory all the same , and a persistent open question is whether there exists such a theory , and whether it is a _ useful _ dual , in the sense of being weakly coupled ( or at least tractable ) when the gauge theory is strongly coupled .    to this end ,",
    "let us note again that in the decoupling limit , the part of the supergravity geometry transverse to the branes assembles into purely gauge theory quantities , when it is referred to from the `` frame '' of a brane probe .",
    "we ought to regard this as a clue . as the geometry is ( a subspace of ) the moduli space of multi  monopoles ,",
    "this leads one to speculate that there may be something to be gained by focusing one s attention there .    on general grounds",
    ", one might expect that this large  @xmath0 dual theory might be a string theory whose world sheet genus expansion is isomorphic to the @xmath166 expansion in the planar diagrams of the field theory , in the usual manner@xcite .",
    "besides this , the putative string theory should encode the structure of ( and allow access to ) the @xmath68 dimensional moduli space of the coulomb branch of vacua .",
    "the @xmath167 symmetry of the gauge theory should be present , as should the phenomenon of the enhanon , _",
    "etc_.    here is a proposal for such a string theory .",
    "simply take the large  @xmath0 limit of the nahm data , but looked at in a different way ! the @xmath36 matrices @xmath131 , for @xmath168 , which satisfy the nahm equations , may be thought of at large  @xmath0 as giving the coordinates of a string in a _ four _ dimensional transverse space .",
    "it is a matrix string constructed by letting the matrices explore the full @xmath68 dimensional moduli space ( or possibly a cover of it ) , which is imposed by the nahm equations ( [ nahm ] ) and the accompanying gauge invariance ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "this proposal is more easily motivated by analogy with a simpler matrix string construction , that of the ten dimensional case of type  iia .",
    "there , we have eight @xmath36 matrices @xmath169 .",
    "while they may be thought of the collective coordinates of @xmath0 d1branes , and hence parameterising @xmath170 , the now ",
    "standard route@xcite reinterprets them at large  @xmath0 as light cone `` string fields '' giving a description the shape of a single iia string in eight transverse dimensions @xmath171 .",
    "the `` second  quantized '' description of the string theory is simply the ( 1 + 1)dimensional @xmath172 gauge theory of the @xmath173 .",
    "in fact , the very same structures are present here , but yielding a ( with respect ) potentially much more interesting string , at least for our purposes , since it contains all of the ingredients to make a dual string for the ( 2 + 1)dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "the naive interpretation of the @xmath131 s is as the non  commutative collective coordinates of @xmath0 d  strings stretched along a finite interval and acting as bps monopoles .",
    "( we are ignoring the two directions common to both types of brane in the setup of section  [ fuzz ] . ) the proposal here is that at large  @xmath0 , the nahm data @xmath131 can be thought of as string fields for a single string having a 4 dimensional transverse target space . to obtain",
    "the `` long string '' sectors required to enable a stringy limit , two modifications to our setup can be considered : the first is that the whole system of ns5branes described in section  [ fuzz ] be placed on a circle , by compactifying the direction in which the branes are separated .",
    "the second is that the donaldson  nahm @xmath172 gauge transformations  ( [ gauge ] ) , which reduce to the identity at @xmath174 @xcite , be allowed to include permutations at the ends of the @xmath134 interval in this periodic system . in this way",
    ", we include configurations in the theory corresponding to a d ",
    "string winding around a large number of times before terminating on an ns5brane .",
    "a periodic version of the 1 + 1 dimensional `` impurity '' gauges theories of the sort described in refs.@xcite should provide the dynamics . to get to strong coupling for the gauge theory",
    ", one must further tune the length of the interval ( and hence the higgs vev ) and the size of the circle to be small , holding the ratio fixed .    by construction",
    ", the string thus defined has many of the properties which we seek for our dual string .",
    "it refers correctly to the moduli space of vacua of the gauge theory by using the monopole moduli space in an essential way .",
    "different vacua of the gauge theory correspond to different backgrounds for the string theory .",
    "a tantalizing consequence of this conjecture ( which clearly needs more work ) for a dual string is that it may provide a dictionary between many of the elegant results about monopole moduli space ( such as the scattering of slowly moving monopoles , geodesics representing bound states , _ etc . _ ) , and properties of the dual gauge theory .",
    "it will certainly be interesting to pursue this further .",
    "there is other recent work on the large  @xmath0 limit of monopoles and nahm data , with connections to brane configurations , and non  commutativity which we ought to mention here .",
    "while they appear to be separate avenues of investigation , it should be interesting to learn if there is anything in those approaches which might help with some of the issues discussed here .",
    "existing proposals by fairlie and collaborators@xcite concerning a matrix / m  theory interpretation of nahm equations ( in diverse dimensions ) at large  @xmath0 emphasize a connection to the moyal bracket(see also ref.@xcite ) , to non  commutative geometry , and the physics of membranes . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "lee studies the case of an infinite sheet of bps monopoles , highlighting its non  commutative description , and a relation to d1strings stretching between d3branes .",
    "it is interesting to note that both of these sets of work make connections at large  @xmath0 to a natural two dimensional non  commutative surface , while in this paper , we have pointed out that the enhanon itself is a non  commutative sphere .",
    "perhaps a firmer connection might be made between these approaches which might lead to a description of the dynamics of the enhanon as a non  commutative membrane _ via _ those techniques .",
    "also , the work of berkooz@xcite studies a 1 + 1 dimensional impurity model ( related to the one we have in mind in this paper ) as a dlcq realization of the 4 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 yang  mills theory found on d4branes . features such as the crossover between open and closed string effective descriptions of the gauge theory at large  @xmath0 are highlighted .",
    "i am grateful to peter forgacs for pointing out my unintentional omission ( in release 1 of this paper ) of the excellent independent early work@xcite on multi  monopoles .",
    "i would like to thank alex buchel , david fairlie , gary gibbons , juan maldacena , rob myers , amanda peet , joe polchinski , eric weinberg and edward witten for useful comments , and samantha butler for her patience .",
