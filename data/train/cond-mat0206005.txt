    "in the last decade , photon entanglement has triggered the proposition of new information processing schemes based on quantum mechanics @xcite . indeed emerging fields such as quantum cryptography and quantum communication @xcite",
    "are based on particle entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "concrete proposals for quantum computing , based on electron transport and electron interactions in condensed matter have been recently presented .",
    "@xcite . among them , devices taking advantage of the macroscopically coherent wave of superconductivity @xcite are promising candidates for the practical realization of a fully solid - state quantum bit @xcite .",
    "recently , the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the generation mechanism for entangled electrons pairs emerging from a superconductor could provide a rather robust alternative to photon entanglement .",
    "it was first shown @xcite that a normal metal fork attached to a superconductor can exhibit positive correlations .",
    "positive correlations had been attributed to photonic systems in the seminal hanbury - brown and twiss experiment @xcite . in our case ,",
    "positive correlations arise because evanescent cooper pairs can be emitted on the normal side , due to the proximity effect @xcite .",
    "these cooper pairs can either decay in one given lead , which gives a negative contribution to noise correlations , or may split at the junction on the normal side with its two constituent electrons propagating in different leads .",
    "this latter effect constitutes the justification for positive noise correlations .",
    "moreover such a mechanism generates entangled and delocalized electron pairs@xcite .",
    "two electrons originating from a broken cooper pair bear entangled energy and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this provides a solid state analog of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) states which were proposed to demonstrate the non - local nature of quantum mechanics @xcite . both theoretical proposals  for positive correlations and for epr entanglement in electronic systems ",
    "are in need for experimental observation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to define a solid - state device together with a detection setup of these both quantum effects .",
    "it is based on a single walled carbon nanotube ( swnt ) coupled to a superconducting electrode ( nicknamed in the following the s - swnt device ) .",
    "troughout the paper a single electron description of transport will be adopted .",
    "this choise is motivated in several ways .",
    "first , single electron scattering theories have been quite successful so far in describing the transport properties of carbon nanotubes .",
    "an example is the seminal fabry - perot experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite which can be interpreted with a ballistic propagation picture .",
    "second , we intend here to describe a rather complex device : electrons are injected from a superconductor in a nanotube , possibly with additional scattering elements or filters .",
    "it therefore makes more sense to first enquire what the transport properties are from the scattering theory point of view , rather than to go immediately to a correlated electron description .",
    "nevertheless , evidence of luttinger liquid behavior in tunneling geometries involving metallic swnts has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurement of the tunneling @xmath0 characteristics @xcite yields density of states exponents which are consistent with strong correlations .",
    "below we address briefly when the single electron picture is expected to hold , and what features of luttinger liquid theory could affect the s - swnt device .",
    "a perturbative argument supports the claim that two electrons originating from the same cooper pair are entangled .",
    "consider two quantum dots ( energies @xmath1 ) next to a superconductor .",
    "the state of the latter is specified by the bcs wave function @xmath2 .",
    "tunneling to the dots is described by a single electron hopping hamiltonian : @xmath3 c_{k\\sigma}+ h.c.~,\\ ] ] with @xmath4 creates an electron with spin @xmath5 .",
    "now let assume that the transfer hamiltonian acts on a single cooper pair . using the t - matrix to lowest ( @xmath6nd ) order",

    ", @xmath9 can only produce singlet states in the dots .",
    "we now present a device where this entangled state propagates along metallic wires .",
    "consider a system consisting of a superconducting electrode which is contacted locally to the middle of a single - walled carbon nanotube .",
    "current can in principle be measured at each extremity of the 1d conductor . from the point of view of the landauer ",
    "buttiker scattering approach to quantum transport @xcite , it consists of scattering elements , including a `` beam splitter '' , and a normal superconductor interface ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a more realistic drawing of this setup is also depicted in fig .",
    "note that this device is analogous to the one used in the fermion analog of the hanbury  brown and twiss experiment @xcite , except that the electron source is a superconductor .",
    "the scattering matrix which specifies the amplitudes of the incoming and outgoing states at the junction does not provide any information about entanglement , because of its single - electron character .",
    "yet we argue here ( and below ) that entanglement is implicit in correlations measurements .",
    "the generation of entangled , non - local electronic states requires that a substantial fraction of cooper pairs distribute their electrons in the two leads , rather than in the same one .",
    "a suggested diagnosis of the presence of cooper pairs in the two arms of a nanotube lies in the noise correlator : @xmath10 evaluated at zero frequency . here",
    ", @xmath11 denotes the current operator in lead @xmath12 .",
    "the positive noise correlations predicted in a single channel ns junction@xcite constitute a direct consequence of these tunneling processes . for the swnt beam splitter",
    ", the presence of two propagating channels at the fermi energy in each lead requires that we address the issue of channel mixing due to impurities / geometrical scattering .",
    "the addition of several transverse channels @xcite may destroy the positive noise correlations which signal the presence of entangled electron pairs .",
    "because of the two channels in each lead , a @xmath13 scattering matrix fully characterizes this branched n - s junction ( no spin - flip scattering ) .",

    "we generate unitary , random matrices by adding a small random perturbation to @xmath30 : @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is a random hermitian matrix with a unit norm .",
    "the limitation @xmath33 then insures that the s  matrix generated in this manner has an increased amount of disorder starting from @xmath34 . in this manner ,",
    "samples with a specific conductance , or equivalently , a specific mean free path per sample length , are generated .",
    "the zero frequency noise correlations are obtained using eq .",
    "[ noise correlation nanotube ] and averaging over @xmath35 sample configurations .",
    "the results are illustrated by the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which show the averaged zero frequency noise correlations as a function of the parameter @xmath21 which parameterizes the connection of the beam splitter to the two nanotube arms .",
    "the different curves correspond to varying degrees of channel mixing .    when an infinitesimal mixing or backscattering @xmath36 is included in each nanotube arm ( weak disorder ) ,",
    "positive noise correlations are observed as in ref .",
    "@xcite for a vast majority of the coupling parameter @xmath21 .",
    "for non zero @xmath36 , the disorder in the nanotube arms is increased , and it restricts the possibility for positive noise correlations .",
    "the positive correlations are mostly reduced in amplitude , while occurring for the same ranges of @xmath21 .",
    "the range of @xmath21 with positive correlations is reduced , and eventually vanishes completely for stronger mixing .",
    "note that the disorder parameter @xmath37 lies in the strong scattering regime .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that this system is sufficiently robust because a weak amount of disorder does not entirely spoils the effect .",
    "the practical implementation of this device @xcite consists of a superconducting reservoir connected to two normal metal leads ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) . ballistic propagation in these normal leads is optimal for the detection of electron entanglement via a noise correlation measurement .",
    "the single walled carbon nanotube ( swnt ) appears to be a good candidate for implementing the normal lead .",
    "indeed swnts can be considered as quasi - ideal one dimensional electron waveguides@xcite , with either metallic or semiconductor behavior depending on their helicity .",
    "metallic swnts have two propagating modes with equal velocity at the fermi level and can exhibit quasi - ballistic transport @xcite . on the other hand",
    "semiconducting swnts can be electrostatically @xcite or chemically doped @xcite to make a single channel conductor , which is however more sensitive to disorder .",
    "nanotubes also present the advantage that they can be reliably assembled into complex integrated circuits @xcite and withstand controlled intra - molecular functionalization @xcite .",
    "these recent advances were realized using state - of - the art nanofabrication techniques : electron beam lithography , together with the alignment , sensitivity and manipulation abilities provided by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "furthermore , swnts can be connected _ in situ _ during their synthesis by letting them grow from superconducting electrodes .",
    "such process involves a chemical vapor deposition route @xcite .",
    "the remaining problem is to create two swnt  superconductor contacts in order to achieve an `` n - s forked''-shaped device .",
    "there have already experimental evidence that such contacts can be made with a sufficiently high transparency so that a supercurrent can flow through the device due to the proximity effect @xcite .",
    "there are two fundamental requirements for this connection .",
    "first , the two constituent electrons of a cooper pair should be transmitted symmetrically in the two leads .",
    "second , the distance between these leads needs to be smaller than the size of a cooper pair .",
    "the fabrication of a connection of two swnts with comparable insulating barrier thicknesses at the surface of the superconductor , remains challenging @xcite .",
    "in fact , the connection to two separate swnts at a superconductor surface can be avoided altogether by using only one swnt coupled to the superconductor in its middle part .",
    "= 8.0 cm    either it could be bent on the superconductor interface ( and the radius of curvature of the bent is small or comparable to the superconductor coherence length ) , or the nanotube is kept straight while a superconducting finger is placed in contact on top . in the latter case ,",
    "the width of the finger is chosen to be comparable to the coherence length ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) so that electrons / holes injected from one normal contact can be andreev reflected into holes / electrons in the opposite normal contact .",
    "several proposals involving the connection of two nanotubes to a superconductor have appeared recently in the literature @xcite , which aim at generating entangled states in the two separated nanotubes .",
    "such a proposal suffers from the fact that the andreev amplitude  or equivalently the cooper pair emission amplitude  is strongly reduced by geometrical factors @xcite .",
    "typically , such factors scale like @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the distance between the two nanotube  superconductor contacts and @xmath40 the fermi wavevector in the superconductor . due to this geometrical factor",
    ", it is necessary for the two nanotubes to be a few nanometers apart . here , it is argued that first , the manipulation of a single swnt contacted on the superconductor is likely to be easier to handle experimentally .",
    "second , and more importantly , the deposition of a quasi one  dimensional object in contact with a superconductor , does not suffer from geometrical factors .",
    "in fact , an incident electron which arrives in the region where the nanotube is in contact with the superconductor may suffer multiple andreev reflections ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - mar ] ) , provided that the interface transparency is good enough .",
    "consequently , an andreev reflected hole will be emitted at the other extremity of the tube , even though @xmath41 .",
    "this mechanism is somewhat related to the idea of a proximity effect in the nanotube @xcite , but its description requires further theoretical study .",
    "= 6.0 cm    note that at the two locations ( right and left on fig .",
    "[ fig - mar ] ) where the tube meets the superconductor , normal scattering is likely to occur because bending the nanotubes generates topological defects in the latter @xcite .",
    "paradoxically , this scattering is necessary in order to break translational invariance , so that the electron incoming from the left can indeed be `` andreev - transmitted '' into a hole on the right ( an not be andreev - reflected on the left ) .",
    "alternatively , the superconducting material could be evaporated on top of the nanotube .",
    "the positive correlations of section [ noise_section ] were due to the splitting of a cooper pair , with the two constituent electrons being redistributed among the two arms of the nanotube .",
    "entanglement will occur if a cooper pair is prohibited to enter a given lead as a whole . in fig .",
    "5 , two specific setups which implement a selective filtering of the correlated electrons are proposed : a ) using two ferromagnetic metal pads ( with magnetizations in opposite directions ) in each lead ( fig .",
    "5a ) which effectively block propagation of electrons bearing the opposite spin , b ) exploiting the difference in kinetic energies of electron and hole quasiparticles and thus positioning either a single gate controlling the energy of intramolecular quantum dots which have been defined either by intramolecular scatterers @xcite or by defining set of gates on the leads ( fig .",

    "nevertheless , the energy degrees of freedom are still entangled , and could in principle lead to a measurement of quantum mechanical non locality : a measurement of energy @xmath60 in lead @xmath24 projects the wave function so that the energy @xmath61 has to occur in lead @xmath6 .",
    "such a measurement could be made connecting the device to a set of quantum dots / energy filters .",
    "however a direct analogy with bell  type inequalities for photons with crossed polarizers is not possible here .",
    "on the other hand , the energy filters do preserve spin entanglement : @xmath62 note that in principle , the electrons emanating from the energy filters could be analyzed in a similar manner as in bell type measurements , using now spin filters with variable magnetization orientation as a detection setup .",
    "the efficiency of spin filtering by connecting a ferromagnetic electrode on a swnt has already been pointed out @xcite , while transport of spin - polarized electrons in a carbon nanotube has been already experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the measurement of perfect noise correlations as illustrated in eq .",
    "( [ noise_one_channel ] ) only constitutes a proof of charge correlation between the two leads .",
    "we now address the correlations of charge and spin . in photon experiments ,",

    "here we exploit the analogy with this bosonic system by specifying energy filters only . as the spin entanglement is preserved by such filters ,",
    "this opens up the possibility for making current measurements with polarized contacts of various orientation .",
    "indeed , the respective polarization orientation of a set of ferromagnetic nano - electrodes can be controlled by an external magnetic field because the magnetization reversal is a function of the size of the electrode .",
    "= 8.6 cm    another point that differs from the photon experiments is that _ transport _ ( average current , or noise correlations averaged over time ) are typically measured , while it is possible to detect photons one by one .",

    "it is then possible to transcribe the bell inequalities expressed usually as correlators of numbers of particles @xcite in terms of noise correlators .",
    "care must be taken so that the contribution of the reducible products @xmath72 can be safely neglected .",
    "this can be achieved by reducing the transparency of the s - swnt interface .",

    "the condensed matter implementation which exploits the filters described in the previous sections appears in fig .",
    "[ fig_bell]b . here",
    "it is argued that the measurement of time dependent currents in the different leads of this device , and the subsequent computation of the cross correlation functions , can lead to a bell inequality test . on general grounds ,",

    "order of estimates for the current and the noise correlations are obtained with the assumption that the andreev cross - reflection probability is denoted @xmath79 . neglecting the angle dependence of the filters , and assuming that electron transmission from the superconductor , then through one of the filter is sequential , gives the current estimate @xmath80 . using the schottky formula",
    "this yields : @xmath81 requiring that the reducible number correlator be negligible compared to the irreducible correlator ( the one connected to the noise ) thus yields , together with @xmath82 and eq .",
    "( [ cor ] ) : @xmath83 this means that strictly speaking , if a bell test is to be performed on this electronic subsystem , the acquisition time , or measurement time , is bounded from above .",
    "note that this is no different from the situation with quantum optics @xcite , in which photons are detected by coincidence counting . in order to probe entanglement",
    ", one needs to distinguish between the two photons of an entangled pair generated by parametric down conversion , and two photons which belong to two distinct pairs , which are uncorrelated . in our solid state setting , this would limit our approach to poorly transmitting andreev interfaces , or alternatively to extremely selective energy filters .",
    "note however that once the assumption is satisfied , the final expression which is to be checked , eq .",

    ", the low shot noise level can not be fully understood with a single electron picture . here , there are two fundamental aspects of luttinger liquid physics which could influence transport in the s - swnt device .",
    "first , consider the propagation of charge along the nanotube .",
    "does it remain a `` good '' wave guide in the presence of interactions ? according to tunneling density of states measurements @xcite , the luttinger interaction parameter is `` strong '' ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is then predicted @xcite that at zero temperature , even the presence of weak impurity scattering can lead to insulating behavior  as shown by renormalization group arguments .",
    "thus the presence of the slightest concentration of impurities could impede electron propagation .",
    "fortunately , at finite temperatures the effective impurity barrier strength @xmath92 is reduced : @xmath93 ( @xmath92 is the bare impurity barrier strength ) . at `` high '' enough temperatures ,",
    "one then recovers a linear current  voltage behavior with a conductance @xmath94 .",
    "note that the higher the temperature , the smaller is the deviation from ideal transmission . except for renormalization of the free conductance by interactions , one should then expect the single electron picture to hold .",
    "the role of coulomb interactions can also be minimized if the nanotube is placed on top of a metallic or a doped semiconductor substrate , or when it is located close to a metallic gate .",
    "the long range coulomb interaction in the nanotube is then efficiently screened , increasing the interaction parameter @xmath95 close to its non - interacting value ( a thin oxide layer should be planned in order to avoid spurious contacts ) .",
    "next consider the injection of electrons in the nanotube .",
    "the addition of a single electron does not represent an eigenstate of the nanotube : this is explicit in the vanishing of the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "an electron is decomposed into pairs of right and left moving chiral excitations with fractional charges @xcite associated with each sector ( charge / spin and total / relative ) .",
    "such charges @xmath96 can in principle be detected via the combination of an autocorrelation noise measurement and of a noise cross - correlation measurement @xcite .",
    "such pairs of charges moving in opposite directions then have entangled degrees of freedom .",
    "next , consider the injection of two electrons in the nanotube . for the s - swnt device without filters ,",
    "two electrons are expected to break up into two pairs of entangled chiral quasiparticles , which are themselves entangled because they originate from the same cooper pair .",
    "nevertheless , in the presence of fermi liquid contacts @xcite , one expect to recover the essential features of a single electron system which is only correlated by the superconductor only , due to the multiple reflections of the quasiparticles at the contacts .    in the presence of selective energy filters or coherent quantum dots , which select positive and negative energies as measured from the superconductor chemical potential , the situation will at first be similar .",
    "quantum dots can accomodate electrons only .",
    "quasiparticles excitations generated by superconductor injection will recombine into electrons when reaching the dots .",
    "however , further propagation _",
    "past _ the dots , along the nanotube extremities will happen once again in a 1d correlated electron system .",
    "it is well known that luttinger liquids exhibit the phenomenon of charge ",
    "spin separation .",
    "charge excitations do not propagate with the same velocity as spin excitations .",
    "experimental claims for the observation of such separation of charge and spin degrees of freedom have been made recently with semiconductor quantum wires obtained with cleaved edge overgrowth techniques @xcite .",
    "provided that no impurities bother the propagation of these excitations it is likely to operate also in the s - swnt device .",
    "if one places ferromagnetic filters further down the extremities , there will then be a time delay @xmath97 between the detection of a charge excitation and the detection of a spin excitations .",
    "while these effects could affect the bell analysis , they can be minimized by reducing the propagation length @xmath98 between the dots and the ferromagnetic filters .",
    "we are aware that the s - swnt device together with its _ in - situ _ integrated entanglement detector is rather difficult to fabricate .",
    "however tremendous progresses have been made in the last few years to make the electrical contact between a swnts and a metallic electrode reliable and reproducible .",
    "indeed , the contact resistance can be reproducibly controlled at values close to ideal threshold of @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the observation of superconductivity induced by proximity effect in carbon nanotubes @xcite confirms that correlated electrons can effectively propagate over mesoscopic lengths in swnts .",
    "we present here several possible directions that could be followed to succeed in realizing such experiment .",
    "first like in most reported experiments for which a metal - swnt - metal junction could be achieved with a resistance lying in the 10 _ k_@xmath100 range , the swnt position could be localized by scanning probe or by transmission electron microscopy .",
    "contacts could be then performed in a second step either by depositing noble metal on top @xcite or by bonding the swnt with a laser pulse @xcite .",
    "it will then involve multilevel deposition of metallic thin films , using aligned masks made by electron beam lithography .",
    "other fabrication schemes could be envisioned even if first published results have concluded to an increased contact resistance with respect to the previously described method : they involve the fabrication of the metallic contacts as the first step with a rather clean top surface .",
    "one could then proceed to the swnt deposition .",
    "there are three different possibilities for that last step : 1 ) deposition of ex - situ synthesized swnt , followed by afm manipulation @xcite , 2 ) deposition of ex - situ synthesized swnt with self assembly guided by functionalized electrodes @xcite 3 ) direct in - situ growth of swnt from contacting catalytic electrodes @xcite .",
    "these two latter methods allow batch processing and avoid any alignment step .",
    "many sample could be performed in parallel which provide a great advantage with respect to all other fabrication schemes that involves time - consuming alignment steps .",
    "ferromagnet pads and/or control gates could be deposited before or after the swnt contacting step depending on the process . in the light of the experimental achievements of refs .",

    "7 ) , two normal metal islands have also been deposited . because of the bending of the nanotubes and the resulting barriers due to bending defects , the latter islands allow to define two quantum dots [ 22,53 ] which play the role of energy filters .",
    "these islands are capacitively coupled to gate electrodes allowing fine tuning of the resonant level in each dot .",
    "the resulting device constitutes the cooper pair splitter with filters .",
    "both ends of the nanotube could therefore be contacted to ferromagnetic leads with varying orientation in order to provide a bell type test .",
    "finally , note that coincidence measurements for single electron events are likely to be feasible in the near future due to recent improvements in the instrumentation of single electron transistors @xcite .",
    "an increase of the detection bandwidth of single electron events is still required .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a single nanotube which plays the role of a normal superconducting beam splitter .",
    "this splitter can be exploited to detect positive ( bosonic ) correlations in _ a priori _ purely fermionic system . in this first step either metallic of semiconducting nanotubes ( with a back - gate )",
    "could be used . moreover , in relation to the ongoing interest in quantum information processing , the addition of filters which select either electron spin or energy could provide a robust scheme for generating entangled pairs electrons at the boundary of a superconductor .",
    "this second experiment is likely to be successful using semiconductor nanotubes because excessive screening in metallic nanotubes would render the gates less efficient .",
    "this nanotube device combines state of the art technology in both metal / superconductor lithography and manipulation / growth of carbon nanotubes .",
    "complications associated with the correlated nature of the electron state in the nanotube  the luttinger liquid  have been addressed qualitatively , and indicate that the working temperature should be chosen large enough to minimize the effect of impurities , but low enough to preserve quantum coherence in the device .    on one hand , it would allow for the first time to perform an epr experiment on massive particles with fermionic statistics .",
    "on the other hand , it could become an useful device for quantum information processing .",
