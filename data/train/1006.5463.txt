    ", we provide a fit to the cen  a sed using this decelerating flow , as the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ figure - sed ] . in this model ,",
    "the high energy emission is due to upstream compton scattering of synchrotron photons produced in the slower part of the flow being scattered by energetic electrons in the faster , upstream part of the flow .",
    "the jet starts with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath101 and decelerates down to @xmath102 in a length of @xmath103 cm .",
    "the injected power law electron distribution , @xmath104 has an index @xmath105 , and extends from @xmath106 , to @xmath107 , and the magnetic field at the inlet is @xmath108 g. jet powers for this model are similar to the one - zone ssc model fits presented in  [ sscmodel ] , although this decelerating model fit is particle- rather than magnetic field - dominated .",
    "we also note that the parameters used in this fit are not unique .",
    "since the single blob model does not seem to be able to reproduce the broadband sed of , could something else be the origin of the vhe @xmath8-rays ?",
    "we have already shown that another blob emitting synchrotron and ssc radiation could explain the hess emission without over - producing any of the other data ( fig .",
    "[ figure - sed ] brown curve ) . @xcite",
    "have presented a model with multiple blobs , moving at different angles to the line of sight from a large opening angle , to m87 and cen  a ( among other objects ) .",
    "this model does seem to be able to explain this sed @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that absorbed @xmath8-rays which create @xmath109 pairs , creating an isotropic halo of electrons in the ism which compton - scatter the host galaxy s starlight , leading to isotropically - produced @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "the hess data do seem to match the @xcite predictions cen  a with a galactic magnetic field of 10 @xmath110 g .",
    "compton - scattering off of leptons accelerated by the supermassive black hole magnetosphere , similar to particle acceleration in pulsars , has been proposed to explain the vhe @xmath8-ray radiation from m87 @xcite .",
    "this could also explain the hess data from separate from the other multiwavelength emission .",
    "as we have noted earlier , what we designate in this paper as the @xmath0-ray `` core '' actually encompasses the radio core , jet , and inner lobes of cen  a. this is also true for the hess emission . @xcite",
    "have noted that a shock front observed in x - rays in the southwest inner lobe could be a source of tev @xmath0-rays , which seems consistent with these observations .",
    "finally , we note that the sed presented here is constructed from non - simultaneous data .",
    "although _ fermi _ and hess @xmath8-rays do not show appreciable variability , they could still be variable on longer timescales .",
    "perhaps for a good , simultaneous multiwavelength sed , a one - zone synchrotron / ssc model could provide a good fit to all of the data . probably the best way to discriminate between the above models ",
    "simple ssc , compton - scattering emission from a pair halo , multiple blobs , etc.is correlated variability between lat @xmath8-rays and other bandpasses .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of simultaneous multiwavelength data .",
    "the auger observatory results indicate some uhecrs could be originating from ( see   [ cena - section ] )",
    ". the uhecrs could interact with photons at the source and in the extragalactic background light leading to an observable signature in the hess band .",
    "if the vhe @xmath8-rays originate from cosmic rays this could account for the discrepancy between hess and _ fermi _ @xmath8-rays .",
    "based on the green curve fit presented in fig.[figure - sed ] we can analyze whether it is plausible for cosmic rays to originate from , keeping in mind that the parameters of that model are not well constrained (   3 ) .",
    "the maximum energy to which cosmic rays can be accelerated is limited by the size scale of the emitting region and the highest energy they can reach before they are cooled .",
    "the former constraint implies that the highest energy a cosmic ray can reach is @xmath111 and the latter implies @xmath112 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath113 is the acceleration efficiency factor , and @xmath114 is the elementary charge , @xmath115 is the atomic number , and @xmath116 the atomic mass of the ion .",
    "note that these timescales , and all quantities expressed above , are in the frame comoving with the blob , although for the particular model considered here , @xmath71=1 so this is not important .",
    "we assume all parameters have values from the green curve model .",
    "thus , it seems for this model that it is unlikely that protons will be accelerated to energies above @xmath117 ev , although it is possible for heavier ions to be accelerated this high before they are disintegrated by interacting with infrared photons from the core .",
    "the threshold energy for photomeson interaction with peak synchrotron photons is similar to @xmath118 .",
    "this process could create observational signatures from secondary emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , as well as convert protons to neutrons , which can escape as cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "again , we note that this result is strongly model - dependent , and the parameters of this model are not strongly constrained , so this limit should not be taken too seriously .",
    "for example , a small change in the doppler factor would have little effect on the model fit , but would require a large change in the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath5 .",
    "a large change in @xmath5 would significantly affect the highest energy to which particles could be accelerated , as seen in eqns ( [ esat1 ] ) and ( [ esat2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if we are viewing a slower sheath , uhe cosmic rays could be accelerated in the faster spine beamed away from our line of sight , which could have significantly different parameters .",
    "acceleration of protons up to @xmath119 requires jet powers of @xmath120 , which may take place in occasional flaring activities in @xcite .",
    "we have reported on observations of with the lat instrument on board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope .",
    "this instrument s excellent angular resolution compared to other @xmath0-ray detectors at mev ",
    "gev energies makes it possible for the first time to separate the lobe and core emission .",
    "the lat observations have been supplemented with simultaneous observations from _ suzaku _ , _ swift _ , the australia telescope long baseline array , and a variety of non - simultaneous data , including those from hess .",
    "our results are as follows :    1 .",

    "2 .   with 10 months of lat exposure",

    "3 .   extrapolated to higher energies ,",
    "the lat spectrum is barely consistent with the hess spectrum @xcite only if the hess spectrum is lowered in flux by its normalization error .",
    "4 .   a single zone ssc model can explain all of the multiwavelength emission from the core except for the non - simultaneous hess emission .",
    "it is not possible to fit the entire sed , including the hess emission , with a single zone compton - scattering model due to internal @xmath79 absorption effects .",
    "modeling results are consistent with suggestions by chiaberge et al .",
    "that we are seeing @xmath0-rays from a different origin that we would if were were looking down the jet .",
