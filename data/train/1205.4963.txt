    "<S> high resolution angle - resolved photoemission measurements are carried out to systematically investigate the effect of cleaving temperature on the electronic structure and fermi surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> this indicates that cleaving temperature is not a key effective factor in suppressing the surface bands . on the other hand , in the aged surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 that is cleaved and held for a long time , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk bands can be enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we have also carried out laser arpes measurements on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by using vacuum ultra - violet laser ( photon energy at 6.994 ev ) and found an obvious enhancement of bulk bands even for samples cleaved at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these information are important in realizing an effective approach in manipulating and detecting the surface and bulk electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the enhancement of bulk sensitivity , together with its super - high instrumental resolution of vuv laser arpes , will be advantageous in investigating fine electronic structure and superconducting properties of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is an unconventional superconductor that has attracted much attention@xcite since the discovery of superconductivity in 1994@xcite with a transition temperature t@xmath2 at 1.5 k@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , this is the only superconductor without copper that has a layered perovskite crystal structure identical to that of copper - oxide ( la , sr)@xmath0cuo@xmath1 high temperature superconductor@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical expectations@xcite and experimental measurements @xcite indicate that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is an unconventional superconductor with a spin - triplet pairing and a possible p@xmath3+ip@xmath4 superconducting order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> its normal state above t@xmath2 exhibits fermi - liquid like behaviors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most recently , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is classified as a topological superconductor which is closely related with majorana fermions and non - abelian statistics@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure and physical properties of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 are dictated by the ru 4d orbitals@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying electronic states originate from the hybridization between the ru 4@xmath5@xmath6 , 4@xmath5@xmath7 , 4@xmath5@xmath8 orbitals and the oxygen 2@xmath9 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - two - dimensional nature of the crystal structure gives rise to nearly two - dimensional fermi surface sheets . among them , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5@xmath6 orbital produces an almost cylindrical fermi surface sheet around the center of the brillouin zone ( usually denoted as @xmath10 sheet , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the nearly one - dimensional nature of the @xmath5@xmath7 and @xmath5@xmath8 orbitals produces nearly planar fermi surface sheets which run perpendicular to x - axis and y - axis , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the hybridization between the @xmath5@xmath7 and @xmath5@xmath8 orbital - generated bands gives rise to a hole - like fermi surface sheet enclosed around m(@xmath11,@xmath11 ) point ( denoted as @xmath12 sheet ) and an electron - like fermi surface sheet around the @xmath13(0,0 ) ( denoted as @xmath14 sheet , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has been well described by band structure calculations@xcite and experimentally confirmed by the quantum oscillation measurements@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is a powerful tool to directly determine the electronic structure and fermi surface of materials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the arpes measurements on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 experienced a complicated and controversial process . </S>",
    "<S> earlier arpes results on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite were not compatible with the band structure calculations and quantum oscillation measurements , rendering people doubt whether arpes , as a surface sensitive technique , is suitable for studying bulk electronic properties@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turned out that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 exhibits a @xmath15@xmath16@xmath15 surface reconstruction arising from the rotation of the ruo@xmath17 octahedra in the surface layer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this surface reconstruction made it possible to resolve the controversy surrounding the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of surface reconstruction produces two effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , in addition to the original one set of bulk fermi surface sheets ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , it produces an additional set of surface fermi surface sheets ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , the @xmath15@xmath16@xmath15 surface reconstruction produces two additional sets of fermi surface sheets : surface shadow bands ( s@xmath21 , s@xmath22 and s@xmath23 ) formed by inverting the original surface fermi surface sheets ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) with respect to the ( @xmath11,0)@xmath24(0,@xmath11 ) line , and bulk shadow bands ( s@xmath18 , s@xmath19 and s@xmath20 ) formed also by inverting the original bulk fermi surface sheets ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) with respect to the ( @xmath11,0)@xmath24(0,@xmath11 ) line . </S>",
    "<S> considering the four sets of fermi surface sheets shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d , the bulk fermi surface picked up from the arpes measurements@xcite becomes consistent with the band structure calculations and quantum oscillation measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> ruo@xmath1 . repeated three - slab of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is used with the middle slab representing the bulk electronic structure while the top and bottom ones representing surface . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> calculated band structure without considering any surface constructions . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> fermi surface corresponding to band structure of ( a ) in one quadrant . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) . band structure with the top and bottom surface ru - o octahedra rotating by 6 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) fermi surface corresponding to band structure of ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that here because of the @xmath15@xmath16@xmath15 surface reconstruction , the real brillouin zone is reduced by half . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of the surface crystal structure and surface electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is crucial for both fundamental studies of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and its potential applications as a topological material in quantum computing@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , as mentioned above , the uncovering of surface reconstruction@xcite is crucial in understanding the arpes - measured fermi surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite ; second , it remains unclear whether sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 can support surface magnetism , as expected from theory@xcite and examined by arpes measrement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , the detection of possible edge state@xcite associated with sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 as a topological superconductor asks for a comprehensive understanding and control of its surface properties . in many cases to investigate the canonical fermi liquid behavior or many - body effects in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , it is preferable to suppress the surface state to make the bulk state dominant@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one way used is to cleave the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 sample at high temperature ( such as 180 k as in @xcite ) which was found to cause suppression of the surface fermi surface sheets . </S>",
    "<S> however , whether the cleaving temperature is a key controlling factor and the mechanism of such a surface band suppression remain unclear@xcite .    in this paper , we report systematic investigation on the influence of cleaving temperature on the electronic structure and fermi surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the surface fermi surface remains obvious and strong in samples cleaved at high temperature , even at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from the previous claim@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that cleaving temperature is not a key effective factor to suppress the surface bands . on the other hand , in the aged surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 cleaved and held for a long time , the bulk bands can be strongly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we also carried out laser arpes measurements on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by using vacuum ultra - violet laser ( photon energy at 6.994 ev)@xcite and found an obvious enhancement of bulk bands even for samples cleaved at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these results are important in finding out an effective way to manipulate and detect the surface and bulk electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission measurements on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 were carried out on our lab arpes system equipped with a r4000 electron energy analyzer together with both a helium discharge lamp ( @xmath25=21.218ev ) and a vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) laser ( @xmath25=6.994 ev ) as light sources@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy resolution was set at 10 mev and 2 mev for helium lamp arpes and vuv laser arpes measurements , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the angular resolution is @xmath260.3@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level is determined by referencing the fermi edge of a clean polycrystalline gold which is electronically connected to the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 sample was grown by traveling solvent floating zone method and has a superconducting transition at t@xmath2 = 1.5 k with a sharp transition width of @xmath260.1 k. all samples were cleaved _ in situ _ and measured in vacuum with a base pressure better than 5@xmath1610@xmath28 torr .    </S>",

    "<S> the sample was first cleaved at 300 k and then measured immediately at 20 k ; ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was first cleaved at 20 k and measured after nearly 17 hours at 20 k. during this period , the sample was slowly warmed up to 100 k and then cooled down . </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) show band structure for the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 samples cleaved at 20 k , 180 k , 300 k and at 20 k but aged , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the corresponding momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) are shown in ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the samples were measured at 20 k. ]    figure 2 shows arpes - measured fermi surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 samples treated with different conditions ; the corresponding energy bands along several high symmetry lines are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . there are two signatures to qualitatively compare the contributions of bulk and surface components . </S>",
    "<S> one is the relative intensities of the bulk @xmath20 band and surface @xmath23 band . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d , the bulk @xmath20 band intersects with the @xmath13(0,0)@xmath24x(0,@xmath11 ) line while the surface @xmath23 band intersects with the x(0,@xmath11)@xmath24m(@xmath11,@xmath11 ) line ; their relative intensity ratio thus provides a measure on the contributions of the bulk and surface bands . </S>",
    "<S> another signature is the relative intensities of the shadow bands and their original bands . </S>",
    "<S> because the shadow bands from the surface fermi surface sheets are expected to be much stronger than those from the bulk fermi surface sheets , their presence and relative intensity can give another measure on the contributions of the bulk and surface bands . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the surface components are dominant in the measured fermi surface of the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 sample freshly cleaved at low temperature ( 20 k , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) , judging from both the relative intensity between the @xmath20 band and the @xmath23 band ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3e ) , and the relative intensity between the s@xmath29 band(s ) and the @xmath20 band ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the surface components remain dominant for the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 samples cleaved at high temperatures ( 180 k and 300 k , figs . 2 and 3 ) . the surface @xmath23 remains strong and the bulk @xmath20 remains weak for the samples cleaved at high temperatures ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3e ) . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , the existence of s@xmath29 is clear . </S>",
    "<S> these indicate that cleaving sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 at high temperatures , even at room temperature , does not result in significant suppression of the surface bands , contrary to the previous report@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the cleaving temperature is not a key factor to effectively suppress the surface bands ; its effect in the previous work@xcite might be due to other factors such as a particular gas component in the measurement chamber . for samples cleaved at high temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the overall signal gets weak . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the measured fermi surface sheets become blurred with some fine features clearly observed for low temperature cleaved sample ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) not resolvable for high temperature cleaved ones ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2b and 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are additional disadvantages caused by high temperature cleaving .    </S>",
    "<S> sample ageing , i.e. , holding the freshly cleaved sample for a long period of time , can help suppress the surface bands . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d and figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3d and 3e , for the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 sample cleaved at 20 k and held in ultra - high vacuum for 17 hours , the bulk bands are obviously enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> this can be judged by comparing the relative intensity of the bulk @xmath20 band and surface @xmath23 band in the mdc curve ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3e ) for the aged sample which gets larger than that of a freshly cleaved sample . </S>",
    "<S> further increase of the surface holding time may further enhance the bulk bands although we note that the overall signal is also significantly reduced in the aged samples .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that arpes is a surface sensitive technique . for the helium discharge lamp with a photon energy at 21.2 ev , </S>",
    "<S> the estimated photoelectron escape depth is on the order of 5@xmath2610 @xmath30 that is just the top one or two layers near surface@xcite . as the photon energy decreases </S>",
    "<S> , the photoelectron escape depth is expected to increase to nearly 30 @xmath30 for the vuv laser with a photon energy of 6.994 ev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this prompts us to investigate the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by utilizing our vuv laser arpes . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4 shows the fermi surface measured with the vuv laser , and the band structure along several momentum cuts . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates that laser arpes is a powerful tool to study sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> first , our vuv laser arpes has the capability to reach the x(@xmath11,0 ) point . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , in the measured momentum range , we clearly resolve @xmath12 fermi surface sheet and @xmath10 fermi surface sheet . </S>",
    "<S> second , the maximum intensity of the bulk @xmath20 sheet is comparable to that of the surface @xmath20 sheet ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4c3 and 4c4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> compared with fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , it is clear that , even for the sample cleaved at 20 k , the bulk bands are strongly enhanced in our vuv laser - based arpes measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> ruo@xmath1 measured by using @xmath31=6.994 ev laser light source . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was cleaved at 20 k and measured at 20 k. ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> fermi surface mapping ; ( b1-b4 ) show band structure for the four representative momentum cuts shown in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c1-c4 ) shows the corresponding mdcs at the fermi level . ]    in summary , we have systematically investigated various approaches to enhance the bulk components of the electronic structure in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cleaving temperature is not a key factor in suppressing the surface bands , as claimed before . </S>",
    "<S> sample aging can help enhance bulk bands . </S>",
    "<S> vuv laser arpes is an effective way to enhance the bulk bands due to the increase of photoelectron escape depth . </S>",
    "<S> these information are important in manipulating and detecting the surface properties of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the enhancement of bulk sensitivity , together with its super - high instrumental resolution of vuv laser arpes , will be advantageous in investigating fine electronic structure and superconducting properties of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in the future .    </S>",
