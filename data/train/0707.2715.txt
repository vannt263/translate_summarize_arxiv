    "the thermodynamic properties of a bose gas are usually studied in the grand - canonical formulation where energy and particle number are fixed on the average .",
    "present - day experiments , on the other hand , are performed in a magnetic or optical trap which contain a roughly fixed number of particles .",
    "thus , the experimental situation may be better approximated by a canonical ensemble with fixed particle number . in the thermodynamic limit one usually expects grand - canonical and canonical treatments to yield the same results for all thermodynamic quantities and the condensate fraction .",
    "this has indeed been proved in @xcite in general and for harmonic traps in @xcite .",
    "some statistical quantities , however , do not have the same thermodynamic limits in the two ensembles .",
    "one fundamental example is the fluctuation width @xmath1 of the particle - number @xmath2 in the ground state . in the grand - canonical ensemble ,",
    "this quantity has the size @xmath3 and is at low temperatures @xmath0 of the order of the total particle number @xmath4 @xcite . in the canonical ensemble , on the other hand",
    ", this quantity can be shown to vanish at @xmath5 since @xmath2 becomes equal to the fixed particle number @xmath4 .",
    "the grand - canonical result is a consequence of the assumed statistical independence of all open grand - canonical subsystems .",
    "this assumption is only fulfilled if there is no long - range ordered condensate , otherwise it is wrong .",
    "the problem can be properly removed by fixing the whole particle number and ignoring its fluctuations as was shown e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the particle number in the ground state is then @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the excited particle number . since",
    ", furthermore , the fluctuation @xmath8 of the thermal gas , consisting of excited states , can be shown to vanish for zero temperature , the same is true for @xmath9 .",
    "its temperature behavior is found to be @xmath10 for an ideal gas in a harmonic trap @xcite and @xmath11 for a homogeneous system @xcite for temperatures @xmath0 below its critical value @xmath12 . by fixing the full particle number @xmath4",
    ", the system does not exchange its particles with the environment at all and this situation , therefore , corresponds to one in a canonical ensemble .",
    "the only exception is that excited states are then still described by the grand - canonical bose - einstein distribution .",

    "the canonical treatment is conveniently performed in a first - quantized path - integral description .",
    "all particles are represented by cycles winding around a cylinder in euclidean spacetime whose circumference is the imaginary - time axis @xmath13 @xcite . for sufficiently low temperatures , the indistinguishability of particles leads to long closed paths winding many times around this cylinder , giving rise to correlated subsets of particles @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this representation was utilized to claim that condensation amounts directly to a proliferation of long cycles .",
    "this claim can , however , not be upheld .",
    "the formation of correlated collectives is the origin of superfluidity , not condensation , as it was correctly implemented for an ideal gas in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the essential signal for the bose - einstein condensation is , instead , associated with the occupancy of the single - particle ground state .",

    "we calculate the partition function of such a canonical system from the trace of the @xmath4-particle imaginary - time evolution amplitude written in the cycle representation of paths .",
    "since this is hard to evaluate numerically for a large particle number , we have derived an efficient recursion relation along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite in section [ grand ] . in section [ spectr ]",
    "this relation is made specific by a spectral decomposition of the canonical partition function .",
    "this allows us in section [ kondens ] to extract the ground - state contribution to the partition function from the cycle representation , from which we read off the probability to find a particle in the ground state .",
    "this is used to define the condensate fraction @xmath14 for a system with a fixed particle number @xmath4 . in section [ pot ]",
    "we apply our results to the bose gas confined in the square - box potential .",
    "there we show that the semiclassical approximation requires a delicate treatment of the ground state for finite systems .",
    "this is necessary in order to obtain the correct low - temperature behavior of the thermodynamical functions in contrast to an earlier theory in feynman s original textbook @xcite .",
    "the results are then compared with an exact quantum mechanical calculation . in the subsequent section [ tkrit ]",
    "we investigate the finite - size effect in a box potential .",
    "we identify a would - be transition temperature as the finite-@xmath4 version of the critical temperature of bose - einstein condensation in a canonical ensemble .",
    "subsequently , canonical results calculated for these crossover temperatures are compared with grand - canonical ones .",
