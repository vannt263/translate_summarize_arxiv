    "there are two major zones of debris in the solar system : the asteroid belt at 2 @xmath4 4  au composed of rocky material that is ground up by collisions to produce most of the zodiacal dust cloud and the kuiper belt ( kb ) that consists of small bodies orbiting beyond neptune s orbit at 30 @xmath4 50  au .",
    "since their discovery over a decade ago ( jewitt & luu 1993 ) , kuiper belt objects have played an increasingly important role in understanding the formation and evolution of our planetary system ( e.g. malhotra 1993 ; kenyon & bromley 2004 ) . while direct detection of _ in situ _ debris from collisions amongst kuiper belt objects has yet to be confirmed , of order 10% of the solar system s far - ir luminosity",

    "because grains not directly ejected by radiation pressure tend to spiral toward the star due to p - r drag , a central depletion would be filled in by dust on p - r timescales ( table 5 ) much shorter than the ages of these systems , unless some other mechanism intervenes to eliminate grains .",
    "we argue that ice sublimation and grain  blowout \" both fail to explain the @xmath47  locations in these systems , and that a possible explanation for the dust spatial distribution is a sizable planet in each system limiting the inward drift of the grains by ejecting them out of the system via gravitational scattering .",
    "an upper limit of the location ( @xmath76 ) at which grains will sublimate can be calculated by assuming that they are composed of water ice with sublimation temperature @xmath104100  k. the maximum grain temperatures ( @xmath42 ) observed in these systems presented in table  [ results ] are all well below the ice sublimation temperature . the presence of grains large enough to radiate efficiently at 70 @xmath0 m implies that their temperature will scale as @xmath105 @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "the radius of ice sublimation @xmath76 will be @xmath107 of @xmath47 for @xmath42 in the range @xmath108 k. and thus sublimation is not a likely explanation for the inner depletion of the disk .",
    "the uncertainties in the temperature estimate are about 10% for individual sources .    can these central zones that are relatively free of dust be explained as the result of dust grains in the outer rings being controlled by mutual collisions rather than p - r drag ?",
    "thus the inner edge of the dust distribution might be explained without invoking the existence of a planet to consume inward drifting grains . in their study of the age dependence of vega - like excesses , dominik & decin ( 2003 ) argued that in dense enough disks , the collision time scale is much shorter than the p - r drag time scale .",
    "if grain collisions actually dominate p - r drag as the dominant dynamical process then grains could be ground to the blowout size , and would not drift radially . in that case , the inner edge to the dust distribution could represent the inner edge of the source bodies .",
    "the dust collision timescales ( @xmath109 ) for the disks can be estimated as @xmath110/9@xmath75 , where @xmath110 is the orbital period at @xmath47 and @xmath75 is the fractional surface density of the disks that is of order the value of @xmath56 ( backman & paresce 1993 ; backman 2004 ) .",
    "the timescales for particles to drift via p - r drag over distances equal to 10% of the @xmath47  values in table  [ results ] ( i.e. , an estimate of the time for grains to move from populated to relatively unpopulated regions ) are about log @xmath111  5.5 to 6.0 years .",
    "the grain - grain collision timescales for the same systems are about log @xmath112  5.0 to 5.5 years . for ratios of this sort between @xmath113 and @xmath109",
    ", a substantial fraction of grains would survive enough collision lifetimes to be able to drift from the disk into a central void .",
    "note also that without knowing more about the disks ( especially , their vertical extents ) we do not know if grain - grain collisions would be at high enough speeds to destroy the grains .",
    "thus we conclude that p - r drag is important in controlling the structures of these systems , especially in that a planetary barrier would be a plausible explanation for a central depletion .",
    "could these cold disks arise from grains generated recently from planetesimals located near @xmath47  and then ejected by radiation pressure from the system , again without needing a planet to explain the inner boundary of the disk ?",
    "we note that these debris belts can be self - stirred without needing a planet to explain the collisional cascade itself ( e.g. , also kenyon & bromley 2004 ) .",
    "spitzer _",
    "observations of vega at 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 m  show that the vega debris disk has an inner boundary at @xmath10  86  au , and extends to distances much larger than those observed at submm and mm wavelengths ( su et al .",
    "the authors suggest that the grains in the vega far - ir disk are produced close to the inner disk boundary and are unbound , flowing away from the star . in this scenario ,",
    "the inner gap in the disk would simply represent a limit to the location of the parent bodies , rather than the location of a perturbing planet",
    ". however , vega s luminosity to mass ratio ( l / m ) is 24 in solar units , which makes even relatively large grains ( like the 18  grains ) to be unbound , with @xmath114 0.5 , if the grain s porosity is @xmath1150.56 .",
    "( @xmath116 is the ratio of the radiation pressure force to the gravitational force ) .",
    "in contrast , for the g star systems we consider here with l / m @xmath10 1 , the 10  silicate grains that dominate the dust emission at 70   have @xmath117 0.02 .",
    "therefore , we argue that grains in the five disks discussed here are bound and as such will drift toward the star due to p - r drag .",
    "one explanation for the inner empty zones is that one or more massive planets dynamically deplete the dust generated by an outer belt of planetesimals ( e.g. , liou & zook 1999 , moro - martn & malhotra 2003 , 2005 ) . if we assume a single planet in a circular orbit about each of the five stars , then this mechanism can account for the large dust depletion factors inferred for the inner parts of these dust disks if the planet is @xmath115 1 m@xmath118 ( moro - martn and malhotra 2005 ) .",
    "the inner edge of the dust disk would be located between 0.8 @xmath119 and 1.25 @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the semi - major axis of the planet .",
    "therefore , a possible explanation is that the dust disk surrounding each of these five systems harbors a planet with an orbital radius of approximately 10 @xmath4 20 au , together with a belt of dust - production planetesimals exterior to the planet s orbit , and no asteroid belt with significant dust production interior to the planet s orbit .",
    "as noted in  4.1 , the data are also consistent with a debris disk comprised of 1  sized grains , inconsistent with the assumptions required for blackbody emission discussed above , yet larger than the blowout size .",
    "in such a model , the timescale for mutual collisions is more than 100 times shorter than the timescale for p ",
    "r drag to significantly affect the orbital radius .",
    "this suggests that a ring such as inferred from the model could be maintained through mutual collisions with dust removal dominated by radiation pressure blowout of the smallest particles @xmath20 1 @xmath0 m on short timescales .",
    "however , this requires the formation of a sun  like star lacking an inner disk , with a remnant planetesimal belt capable of generating dust through mutual collisions only outside of 200 au with dust only at the smallest possible stable particle size .",
    "while the presence of a low mass companion could in principle explain such a large gap in the circumstellar environment , no wide stellar companions are known in these systems , and we do not expect many brown dwarfs ( due to the observed lack of such systems ) or giant planets ( given current formation scenarios ) at these radii .",
    "we believe that models requiring larger grains ( @xmath10 10 ) at smaller radii ( @xmath10 30 au ) with the possible presence of a planet ( or planetary system ) interior to 30 au are favored as they are consistent with the structure and extent of circumstellar disks observed around pre ",
    "main sequence stars during the epochs when planetary systems are thought to form .",
    "we hope to distinguish between these two hypotheses in the future through direct imaging of the outer edge of the disks in scattered light and placing strong constraints on the presence of very low mass companions at large separations ( e.g. with nicmos coronagraphy on hst and ground  based ao observations ) .",
    "we have presented _ spitzer _ observations of five sun - like stars that possess kuiper belt - like debris systems ( hd  6963 , hd  8907 , hd  122652 , hd  145229 , and hd  206374 ) .",
    "of these two were previously suggested to have debris disks ( hd  8907 and hd  122652 ) , and three are newly discovered .",
    "the fractional luminosity ( @xmath56 ) and ages of these newly identified disks illustrates the potential of the feps program to measure fainter debris systems , which will allow a more detailed census of their nature and evolution .",
    "the five excess sources have seds that are consistent with photospheric models out to 33@xmath0 m , but show clear excesses at 70  @xmath0 m , which was the selection criterion .",
    "we find that these stars are all `` old '' ( four sources are in our 1 @xmath4 3 gyr age bin , while one , hd 145229 , is in the 0.3 @xmath4 1 gyr age bin ) .",
    "as seen in figure  [ histogram ] , the improved sensitivity of _ spitzer _  allows us to detect debris disk systems that are much fainter than those detected by iras and iso .",
    "the overall impression is that kb - like systems detectable by spitzer and considered in this paper are less massive and more distant than systems detected with iras and iso .    \\3 .",

    "we infer that these systems have outer remnant planetesimal belts that are consistent in scale and starting masses to our kuiper belt .",
    "the absence of a disk around the @xmath122  gyr old star hd  13974 suggests that either this object does not contain the parent bodies that produce infrared - emitting debris , or perhaps the debris has been cleared out already .",
