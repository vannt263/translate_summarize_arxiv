    "robust design has been widely recognized as a leading method in reducing variability in the quality characteristic and improving quality .",
    "it is also recognized that quality improvement activities are most efficient and cost - effective when implemented during the design stage .",
    "because of their practicability , robust design techniques have found increased applications in many manufacturing industries .",
    "many industries are of great interest in the potential for applying robust design principles and are seeking a role in the information revolution with robust design at its core .",
    "the primary goal of robust design is to minimize variation in the quality characteristic of interest while keeping a process mean at the customer - identified target value . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", @xcite introduced a systematic method for applying experimental design , which has become known as robust design .",
    "even though the _ ad hoc _ robust design methods suggested by taguchi remain controversial due to various mathematical imperfections , there is no serious disagreement among engineering researchers and practitioners about his basic philosophy .",
    "the controversy surrounding taguchi s assumptions , his experimental design , and his experimental analysis has been well addressed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "consequently , researchers have closely examined alternatives using well - established statistical tools from traditional theories of experimental designs . in an early attempt of such research",
    ", @xcite introduced the dual response approach based on a response surface methodology ( rsm ) as a superior alternative for modeling process relationships by separately estimating the response functions of the process mean and variance .",
    "the mean target value and variance of the target value are assumed to be polynomial functions of the various possible design points .",
    "multiple experiments are conducted at the various design points in order to obtain estimates of the mean and variance of the target value at the various design points .",
    "then , given these estimates , the coefficients for the response surface functions are estimated using standard regression techniques and the functions are assumed to hold continuously and therefore for points between the design points considered during the experiments .",
    "@xcite then obtain the optimal design point ( usually somewhere between those used during the experiment ) by minimizing an objective function that penalizes mean bias and variance .",
    "thus , it achieves the primary goal of robust design by minimizing the process variance while adjusting the process mean at the target .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that the robust design solutions obtained from the dual response model may not necessarily be optimal since this model forces the process mean to be located at the target value and proposed the mean - squared - error model , relaxing the zero - bias assumption . while allowing some process bias ,",
    "the resulting process variance is less than or at most equal to the variance obtained from the model proposed by @xcite ; hence , the mean - squared - error model may provide better ( or at least equal ) robust design solutions if the zero - bias assumption is not required .",
    "the robust design approach to determining optimum values has been further studied by several researchers , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    as afore - mentioned",
    ", the majority of the research on robust design modelling have focused on methodological development of models for optimizing operating conditions .",
    "although this is critically important for continuous quality improvement , the immediate question is  how accurate are these optimum operating conditions ? \" to the best of our knowledge , the answer for this question has not been properly addressed in industrial applications of dual response surface methods .",
    "we can consider interval estimation for a single variable or joint confidence regions for multiple variables as an answer for this question .    with the help of the bootstrap technique ,",
    "we develop procedures for obtaining joint confidence regions for the optimum operating conditions .",
    "the single response surface approach uses the method of least squares to obtain the adequate single response functions , while the squared - loss approach uses two surfaces for process mean and variance . for the single response surface approach ,",
    "the variance - covariance matrix of the regression coefficients can be easily obtained , so the derivation of the joint confidence region for optimum conditions is straightforward . for more details , see @xcite . with two response functions , however , it is quite difficult to obtain the variance - covariance matrix of the regression coefficients for both the mean and variance responses , particularly when the sample size is not large .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by using bootstrap techniques . in an era of powerful computers , computer - intensive methods such as the bootstrap technique promise to be one of the mainstays of applied response surface methodology and engineering statistics in the years ahead .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basics of robust design are introduced in section  [ sec : rd ] . the bootstrap approach to determining joint confidence region for the optimum conditions",
    "is described in section  [ sec : boot ] , followed by a case study in section  [ sec : case ] and the paper ends with concluding remarks in section  [ sec : concluding ] .",
    "we consider a system with a response @xmath0 .",
    "this response depends on the levels of @xmath1 control factors @xmath2 .",
    "the following assumptions are generally made :    * the response @xmath0 depends on @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 can be viewed as a function of @xmath3 , that is , @xmath4 .",
    "but , the functional structure @xmath5 is either unknown or very complicated .",
    "* the levels of the control factor @xmath6 for @xmath7 are continuously quantitative . *",
    "the levels of the control factor @xmath6 for @xmath7 can be controlled by the experimenter .",
    "following @xcite , the mean and variance response functions ( surfaces ) can be written as    @xmath8    respectively , where @xmath9 . to find the fitted response surfaces given above",
    ", we must regress the mean response @xmath10 and the variance response @xmath11 on the control factors , @xmath12 .",
    "hence , we must estimate the mean and variance responses at each design point .",
    "the most popular estimation method is to find the maximum likelihood estimates , assuming that the error variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 are normally distributed .",
    "suppose that @xmath15 replicates are taken at the @xmath16th design point .",
    "let @xmath17 represent the @xmath18th response at the @xmath16th design point where @xmath7 and @xmath19 .",
    "the most popular estimators of the location and scale parameters are mean and variance , respectively .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates of the mean and variance at the @xmath16th design point are the sample mean and variance as shown below .",
    "@xmath20    let @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the fitted response functions for the mean and variance of the response @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "assuming a second - order polynomial model for the response functions , we get    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    we use the sample mean and variance of @xmath0 to estimate the process mean @xmath21 and variance @xmath22 , respectively .    the main goal of robust design is to obtain the optimum operating conditions of control factors , @xmath12 , and this can be achieved by employing the following squared - loss optimization model :    @xmath25 subject to @xmath26 \\mathrm{~~for~ } j=1 , 2 , \\ldots , k,\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the customer - identified target value for the quality characteristic of interest , and the constraint specifies the feasible joint region of operating covariates given by @xmath9 .",
    "when factorial designs with @xmath1 levels are used , the constraint becomes @xmath28 \\mathrm{~for~ } j=1 , 2 , \\ldots , k$ ] .",
    "the control factors ( @xmath29 ) solving the optimization problem above are the optimal design point estimates .    when considering the process variance on the left hand side of the regression model in ( [ eq : v ] )",
    ", one often uses the log - transformed values of the sample variances , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 , since a linear model for the variance process does not guarantee that the predicted values are always positive ; see @xcite",
    ". using the log - transform , we can avoid the problem of the negative estimates in the variance process . after estimating the logarithm of the process variance , @xmath31",
    ", we can obtain the optimal operating conditions by minimizing    @xmath32    subject to @xmath26 \\textrm{~~for~~ } j=1 , 2 , \\ldots , k .\\ ] ]    it is noteworthy that the following dual - response optimization model proposed by @xcite can also be used for optimization purposes :    @xmath33    subject to @xmath34 \\textrm{~~for~~ }   j=1 , 2 , \\ldots , k .\\ ] ] however , the dual - response model strictly imposes a zero - bias condition while the squared - loss model allows some bias ( _ i.e. _ , absolute value of the difference of @xmath35 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "this squared - loss model often results in less variability , and will be the focus of this paper . for detailed information regarding the squared - loss model , readers may refer to @xcite .",
    "the bootstrap technique was first developed by @xcite and this method has become one of the most popular computer - intensive statistical methods . the technique is simple yet powerful .",
    "the key idea is to retake samples from the original data in order to create re - sampled data sets from which the variability of the quantities of interest can be assessed without long and error - prone analytical calculations .",
    "as afore - mentioned , unlike the single response surface method , it is quite difficult to obtain the theoretical variance - covariance matrix of the regression coefficients for both the mean and variance responses when two response functions are considered .",
    "the alternative is to calculate the statistic of interest from simulated data sets using the bootstrap re - sampling technique .",
    "we denote such a simulated data set as @xmath36 .",
    "it is standard to let the superscript notation ( @xmath37 ) denote a bootstrapped or re - sampled value .",
    "the statistic of interest ( optimum operating conditions ) is calculated with a simulated data set . by simulating @xmath38 times",
    ", we obtain @xmath38 simulated optimum operating conditions . using these conditions ,",
    "we can obtain the joint confidence region of the optimum operating conditions of control factors .",
    "the bootstrap algorithm is as follows :    for @xmath39 :    1 .",
    "draw @xmath40 with replacement from @xmath41 for @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   find the optimum operating conditions using the above data set .",
    "we denote this as @xmath42 .",
    "3 .   repeat the above two steps for @xmath39 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath38 simulated optimum operating conditions @xmath42 for @xmath39 .",
    "there are several ways of finding the joint confidence regions using bootstrapped samples . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we briefly introduce two methods :    1 .   the construction of a rectangular region using a bonferroni argument .",
    "the construction of an elliptical contour based on an approximation to the multivariate normal distribution .    in the following section",
    ", we describe these two methods using a numerical example with multi - filament microfiber tows .",
    "a company produces multi - filament microfiber tows .",
    "we conduct an experiment to determine the quality effect of control covariates . for such products ,",
    "the key control factors are polymer temperature ( @xmath43 ) and polymer feeding speed ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the diameter ( @xmath0 ) of the microfiber is the most important quality issue and its nominal target value is @xmath45 microns .",
