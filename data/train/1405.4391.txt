    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze a stationary fermion transport , giving rise to electric current if the carrier particles are charged , between two heat baths connected through a geometric scatterer . by the latter we mean a quantum mechanical system of a mixed dimensionality consisting of a compact two - dimensional manifold @xmath0 to which two ( infinite ) one - dimensional continuous leads are attached  cf .",
    "[ geomscatt ]  the latter are considered as heat and fermi particle baths at equilibrium for given temperatures and chemical potentials . this assumption is made for simplicity . in general , one can think of the leads as of connecting links between the manifold and the baths , however , since in a one - mode quantum transport the particles are in the asymptotic regime once they leave the manifold , the identification of the leads with the baths is the easiest way .",
    "the main tool for our analysis is the landauer - btticker formula , which expresses a steady fermion current ( in other words , a particle flux ) through the sample ( scatterer ) in terms of the transmission probability for the scatterer and of the external reservoirs equilibrium states . under quite general conditions",
    "the formula has been proved in @xcite for the quasi - free fermions transport in the framework of the @xmath1-scattering approach .",
    "in fact , this approach allows much more , namely to construct non - equilibrium steady states and to make contact with non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , see the three - volume review @xcite for a thorough discussion .",
    "we are not going to prove the landauer - btticker formula in the present context , because for our restricted purpose of study only the fermion current it can be done repeating _ verbatim _ the argument used in the analogous situation in @xcite , where discrete leads and a discrete sample @xmath0 were considered .",
    "the formula has two essential ingredients : _ fermi functions _ for the thermal statistical distributions of non - interacting fermions in the leads ( reservoirs ) and the quantum _ transmission probability _ between the leads , which results from the stationary scattering calculations of the single - particle passage throughout the sample .    in a sense",
    "the problem of a stationary current through the manifold @xmath0 that we treat here can be regarded as a ` continuous ' version of the model discussed in @xcite describing a similar effect in the discrete setting .",
    "however , the continuous case has its peculiarities . while the difference is not very important for treating the leads , it it becomes nontrivial in the analysis of scattering problem due to its mixed dimensionality , due to which the transport in such systems exhibits unusual and interesting features .",
    "let us add that the way to describe quantum dynamics of such ` strange ' scatterers can be traced back to @xcite ; it is based on construction of admissible hamiltonians as self - adjoint extensions of a suitable symmetric operator , starting from the situation when different parts of the configuration space are decoupled .",
    "let us mention that the _ ballistic _ conductance  but not the current  for a mixed dimensionality scatterer was the subject of the paper @xcite where the model of one - dimensional leads attached to a quantum sphere was investigated . from the quantum - mechanical point of view ,",
    "the central problem both in @xcite and in the present paper how to match wave - functions of the leads and the manifold @xmath0 at the points of their junctions . the mentioned construction based on self - adjoint extension can be performed in different , equivalent ways , the result being always a family of boundary conditions involving appropriate generalized boundary values @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we do not reduce ourself to the linear response , i.e. to analysis of the conductance .",
    "we study the non - equilibrium current @xmath2 throughout geometric scatterers as a function of two parameters : the difference : @xmath3 of the two leads _",
    "electro - chemical _ potentials with the aim to deduce the quantum _ ohm law _ , and the _ plunger gate _",
    "voltage @xmath4 applied to the scatterer , which controls its _ resonant _ quantum conductance .",
    "note that in contrast to @xcite we consider here the two ` external ' parameters _ separately_. of course , in certain cases it is plausible to work with the hypothesis @xmath5 which implies a highly non - linear current - voltage behaviour @xcite , however , the current - driving potential difference @xmath6 and the gate voltage @xmath4 controlling the conductance are _ a priori _ of a different nature .",
    "in particular , experimentally one can modify the quantum ( resonant ) conductance by varying @xmath4 , see @xcite .",
    "what concerns the literature indicated above , the ballistic ( @xmath7 ) linear response @xmath8 with @xmath9 , was the subject of @xcite , whereas the resonant conductance @xmath10 modification by variation of @xmath4 was considered in @xcite .",
    "the present paper analyses the current - voltage dependence @xmath2 , that is , the ohm law , parameterized by the plunger gate voltage @xmath4 .",
    "let us briefly review the contents of the paper . in the next section",
    "we describe the construction used to couple the wave function and indicate which of the hamiltonians obtained in this way might be physically the most relevant . using the result",
    ", we solve in sec .",
    "3 the quantum - mechanical scattering problem finding the transmission probability as a function of the involved particle momenta ; we shall also explain how the needed quantities can be computed for a compact manifold @xmath0 .",
    "the concluding section is devoted to discussion of examples in which @xmath0 is a two - dimensional rectangular and triangular ` billiard ' . using the landauer - bttiker formula we compute the current and",
    "analyze numerically its dependence on the model parameters .",
    "[ geomscatt ]",
    "as we have said , the core of the model is the quantum - mechanical scattering on such a geometric object with leads attached .",
    "the first question to address is how they can be coupled mutually in a way which would conserve the probability current .",
    "following @xcite this question was investigated in various papers ",
    "one can mention , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "their result can not be directly used for our purpose , however , since in all those works it was assumed that that the energy is conserved , i.e. that the particle momentum is the same on both the leads , and have to be modified .",
    "one can adopt the ( quantum ) transfer matrix approach , @xmath11 with @xmath12 derived in @xcite where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the boundary values of the wave functions on the leads at the junctions , however , using it as a component of our model , one has to take into account that the particles move with velocities given by the temperatures and chemical potentials of the reservoirs .    to construct the model indicated in the introduction",
    "one has to know how to describe motion of a quantum mechanical particle on a configuration space of a mixed dimensionality .",
    "a general prescriptions how the corresponding self - adjoint hamiltonians can be constructed was first formulated in @xcite . since the most natural coupling is _ local _ , we may disregard geometrical peculiarities of the lead and the surface and illustrate the construction in the setting where a halfline is attached to a plane .",
    "the state hilbert space is then @xmath15 and if we neglect physical constants the hamiltonian acts on its elements as @xmath16 to make such an operator self ",
    "adjoint one has to impose suitable boundary conditions which couple the wave - functions at the junction .",
    "the boundary values to be used are obvious on the lead side being the columns @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , in the plane we have to use generalized ones .",
    "to understand how to define them , we note that if we restrict two - dimensional laplacian to functions vanishing at the origin and take the adjoint to such an operator , the functions in the corresponding definition domain will have a logarithmic singularity at the origin @xcite .",

    "the time reversal which we will assume throughout in the following .",
    "it is worth noting that the above boundary conditions are generic but do not cover all the self - adjoint couplings leaving out cases when the coefficient matrix is singular ; this flaw can be mended in the standard way @xcite if one replaces ( [ bc ] ) by the symmetrized form @xmath25 with appropriately chosen matrices @xmath26 . for our present purpose ,",
    "however , the generic conditions ( [ bc ] ) are sufficient .",
    "the question which boundary conditions are physically ` correct ' ones is difficult and the general answer to it is not known .",
    "we will not address it here and limit ourselves to mentioning that various choices are used :    a.   the simplest possibility is to keep just the term coupling the two parts of the configuration manifold , i.e. to put @xmath27 .",
    "b.   a heuristic way to choose the ` natural ' coupling was suggested in @xcite : comparing the scattering matrix of the coupling given by ( [ bc ] ) with the low  energy behavior of scattering in the system of a plane to which a cylindrical ` tube ' is attached , one arrives at the identification @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the contact radius ; physical relevance of these conditions was illustrated in @xcite by explaining the experimentally observed distribution of resonances in a microwave resonator with a thin antenna . c.   the choice of the coupling amounts to fixing the singularity of the hamiltonian green s function at the connection point .",
    "one can do that directly without using boundary conditions explicitly @xcite .",
    "what is important is the local character of the coupling which makes it possible to use the above description of the coupling in any situation where a one - dimensional segment is attached to a smooth two - dimensional surface ; this is what we will use in the following .",
    "equipped with the above notions we can now solve the quantum mechanical part of the problem .",
    "the first step consists of finding the transfer matrix ( [ l ] ) for our system .",
    "this part is essentially the same as in @xcite and we include it in order to make the paper self - contained .",
    "the compact manifold @xmath0 describing the geometric scatterer may or may not have a boundary ; we suppose that the two leads are attached to it at two different interior points @xmath30 of @xmath0 . the manifold part of the hamiltonian is the laplace - beltrami operator on the state hilbert space @xmath31 of the scatterer . it is coupled to the laplacians on the two leads by the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) with the coefficients indexed by @xmath32",
    "; later we will assume that the couplings are the same .",
    "the most important object for us is the green s function @xmath33 of the laplace - beltrami operator , i.e. the integral kernel of its resolvent which exists whenever the @xmath34 does not belong to the spectrum .",
    "its actual form depends on the geometry of @xmath0 but the diagonal singularity does not .",
    "the reason is that the manifold @xmath0 admits in the vicinity of any point a local cartesian chart and the green s function behaves with respect to those variables as that of laplacian in the plane , @xmath35 looking for transient solutions to the schrdinger equation , we need a general solution to the laplace - beltrami equation on @xmath0 for the energy @xmath34 . without loss of generality , we may write it as @xmath36 where @xmath30 are the contact points @xcite . in view of ( [ expansg ] )",
    "the singularities of @xmath37 at @xmath30 have the character ( [ expans ] ) and we can evaluate the generalized boundary values ( labeled by the point at which they are taken ) to be @xmath38 = -\\frac{a_j}{2\\pi}\\,,\\qquad l_1[x_j ] = a_j\\xi(x_j , k)+a_{3-j}g(x_1,x_2;k)\\ ] ] for @xmath32 , where @xmath39 let @xmath40 be the wavefunction on the @xmath41-th lead . using the abbreviations @xmath42 for its boundary values we infer from the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) that @xmath43 where we have denoted @xmath44 .",
    "note that in the first equation of the second pair we used the opposite sign , because it is natural to identify the second ( i.e. , the ` right ' ) lead with @xmath45 .",
    "it is straightforward to rewrite these equations as a linear system with the unknown @xmath46 and to solve it ; this gives in particular the transfer matrix , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; in these formula @xmath50 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath51 hence @xmath52 as long as we suppose that the coupling is time - reversal invariant and the parameters @xmath53 are real .",

    "we adopt in the following both hypotheses so that our model will be characterized by three real parameters @xmath54 ; in that case the transfer matrix ( [ geom l ] ) simplifies to the form @xmath55      to make use of the landauer - bttiker formula we have to know the @xmath56-matrix , in particular the transmission amplitude via a quantum gate ( dot ) for the process in question . to fix direction of the particle current note that according this formula electrons ( fermions , however , the results apply to transport of arbitrary fermions . ] ) are moving from the ` left ' ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) to the ` right ' ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) lead _ if _ the bias of _ electro - chemical _ potentials in these leads is _ positive _ , i.e. @xmath61 .    on the other hand in the nonballistic regime , @xmath62 , the incoming ( ` left ' ) and outgoing ( ` right ' ) particles may have different momenta @xmath63 , hence the formula relating @xmath12 and @xmath56 derived in @xcite is not applicable . it is not difficult , however , to derive a more general result to replace it . to this aim , we write the scattering solutions to the ` left ' and ` right ' of the manifold @xmath0 as @xmath64 \\label{ansatz } \\\\[-.5em ] u_2(x)= t\\ , \\mathrm{e}^{ik_2x } & \\quad \\dots \\quad & x>0 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] > from this ansatz we get the boundary values @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , which will enter the coupling conditions ( [ bc ] ) as @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the ` left ' and ` right ' lead , respectively .",
    "the relation between @xmath70 and @xmath71 is determined by the conservation of energy , i.e. by the fact that their squares differ by @xmath4 .",

    "needless to say , we consider only the situation when the leads are not decoupled from the resonator , @xmath81 , in which case the expression in the denominator makes sense .",
    "the behaviour of the function @xmath82 is in general quite complex .",
    "it has been analyzed in previously in a particular situation when @xmath83 ( i.e. , in the ballistic regime , @xmath84 ) and @xmath0 is a sphere to which the leads are coupled in polar or non - polar positions and in particular ways @xcite .",
    "such systems have numerous resonances corresponding to energies for which the terms linear in the momentum dominate in the denominator , while away from them the transmission is governed by the quadratic term and decreases with increasing energy .",
    "it is expected that the same will be true for a much wider class of geometric scatterers .      to make use of the above results one must be able to evaluate the functions @xmath79 entering the formula ( [ transm ] ) .",
    "since @xmath0 is supposed to be compact , so the laplace - beltrami operator on it has a purely discrete spectrum , one can use the corresponding spectral analysis ; we recall the procedure following again essentially the discussion in @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , interchanging the limit with the sum is not without risk since the series does not converge uniformly ; to see that the result may indeed depend on the regularization procedure , it is sufficient to replace @xmath93 by @xmath94 at the left - hand side . to gauge the possible non - uniqueness ,",

    "we illustrate in figure  5 variation of the current @xmath175 as a function of the electrochemical potential @xmath60 in the left reservoir for several values of the potential bias @xmath168 .",

    "another effect to notice concerns the behaviour for small @xmath60 .",
    "if the bias is small , the current is negligible there , since the transmission probability @xmath123 is tiny only for the spectral parameter @xmath176 ; it becomes visible at larger values of @xmath6 due to the ` fermi - dirac averaging ' .",

    "we choose a small potential bias , @xmath177 . in the low - temperature regime",
    "the transmission probability @xmath123 is then integrated with a function close to a narrow box which produces a plot ` interpolating ' between the first two graphs of figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "if the temperature is considerably higher , @xmath174 turns into a widely spread smooth peak leading again to washing out the resonance structure .        turning to the non - ballistic regime ,",

    "the only contribution to the current comes in view of ( [ xi2 ] ) from the values of the spectral parameter @xmath140 belonging to the interval @xmath165 , and it follows from assumption ( [ k12 ] ) that the current vanishes unless @xmath182 .",
    "this no longer true for positive temperatures , however , in the low temperature regime such as @xmath170 considered in figure  7 the current above the value @xmath183 is still negligible .",
    "this is easy to understand taking into account the exponential fall - off of the smearing function .",
    "figure  7 also shows that below this threshold value the current increases .",
    "this effect comes from the increase of the transmission probability @xmath123 with the of the plunger - gate potential @xmath4 .",
    "we have remarked at the end of sec .",
    "[ rectres ] that this quantity may exceed one for @xmath146 , and without showing the graph we claim that it indeed happens here for @xmath4 large enough .        however , the increase is in general not monotonous , because the resonance effects are not complete suppressed by the smearing with @xmath174 .",
    "this is shown on our last picture , figure  8 , where we plot again the current _ vs. _ the plunger - gate voltage .",
    "now we stay below the ` threshold ' value @xmath183 and we see that the plot may have peaks depending on both values of the electrochemical potentials . furthermore , we illustrate how the plot changes with @xmath60 . at both graphs",
    "the solid curve shows the situation for @xmath185 and @xmath186 , the dotted ones show what happens if @xmath60 changes to 25 and 40 , respectively .",
    "we see that the upper part of the plot changes only a little , while for smaller values of @xmath4 the change of @xmath60 reveals an additional structure .",
