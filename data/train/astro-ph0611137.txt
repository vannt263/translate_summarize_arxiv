    "the goal of the dark energy survey ( des ) is to perform a 5000 sq deg @xmath0 imaging survey of the southern galactic cap in order to constrain the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath2 to @xmath35% ( statistical errors ) in each of four complementary techniques and to begin to contrain the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to redshift ( @xmath5 ) . by meeting this goal",
    ", des will serve as a stepping stone to next - generation large - scale dark energy projects like large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) , the joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) , and the square kilometer array ( ska ; @xcite ) .",
    "the survey will utilize the blanco 4 m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) . in order to achieve the goal of surveying half of the southern sky in a reasonable amount of time , the des collaboration will replace blanco s prime focus cage with a new 3 sq deg ( @xmath1-diameter ) optical ccd mosaic imager known as the dark energy camera ( decam ) .",
    "the decam is scheduled for design and construction during the 20052009 time period and , once commissioned , will be available for community use as well as for the des .",
    "observations for the des will encompass a total of 525 nights ( 30% of the telescope time ) over the course of 5 years starting in 2009/2010 . for best viewing of the southern galactic cap , the des observations will be performed during the months of september through february .",
    "the des will measure the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath4 to @xmath35% in each of four complementary probes :    galaxy cluster counting : : :    the des will identify and measure the redshifts and masses of 20,000    galaxy clusters with masses @xmath6 out to a redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "the number of    clusters as a function of redshift is a strong function of    cosmological parameters , including @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "weak lensing : : :    the des will identify and measure the shapes of 300 million galaxies    over 5000 sq deg .",
    "the clustering of mass as a function of redshift is    also strongly determined by various cosmological parameters , including    @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "spatial clustering of galaxies : : :    the des will identify and measure the photometric redshifts of 300    million galaxies out to a redshift of @xmath8 and beyond .    the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of redshift is also a    function of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "standard candles : : :    @xmath910% of des observing time will be devoted to a    supernova survey covering 40 sq deg of sky . it is expected that des    will discover 1900 type ia supernovae in the redshift range    @xmath10 during the course of its supernova survey .",
    "construction of a hubble diagram using type ia supernovae as standard    candles is a well - known means of measuring the parameters of dark    energy @xcite .",
    "note that , since the des is purely an imaging survey , good photometric redshifts out to a redshift of @xmath11 are critical to its success ( see fig @xmath12 ) . to obtain sufficiently accurate photometric redshifts to achieve the des goals ,",
    "the all - sky photometry must be accurate to 2% or better .",
    "such photometric accuracy is also necessary to obtain good light curves for the supernova survey part of the des program .",
    "the des will not only be a wide survey ( 5000 sq deg ; see fig @xmath13 ) , but it will also be deep . for galaxies , it is estimated that the 10@xmath14 detection limit will be 24.6 , 24.1 , 24.3 , 23.9 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively . likewise , for point sources , it is estimated that the 5@xmath14 detection limit will be 26.1 , 25.6 , 25.8 , 25.4 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . for comparison ,",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) reports a 95% completeness limit for point sources of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the observing strategy is to use 100 sec exposures , and observe ( typically ) two filters per telescope pointing . during dark time",
    ", these filters will be @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; during bright time , they will be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are much less affected by sky brightness caused by moonlight .",
    "multiple tilings and large offset overlaps will allow the des to achieve its desired depth and will be important in optimizing photometric calibrations .",
    "the current idea for survey strategy is to complete two full tilings in each filter each year , for a five - year final tally of 5 tilings each in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , 7 tilings in @xmath17 , and 13 tilings in @xmath18 .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the des requirement for all - sky photometric accuracy is 2% ( 0.02 mag ) ; an enhanced goal is 1% ( 0.01 mag ) .",
    "the decam focal plane ( a.k.a . , `` the hex '' ; fig .  [ fig3 ] ) will be a mosaic containing 62 2k@xmath204k imaging ccds , yielding a camera having a grand total of 520 million pixels . at the prime focus of the blanco",
    ", the pixel scale of this camera will be 0.27 arcsec pixel@xmath21 .",
    "the ccds themselves are a lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) design .",
    "they are fully depleted and 250 microns thick , yielding high quantum efficiency in the @xmath18 band ( qe @xmath22 50% at 1 micron ) .",
    "the ccd electronics will permit the full camera to be read out in only 17 seconds .",
    "in figure  [ fig4 ] we present a flowchart which represents our current vision for the photometric calibration of the des .",
    "the eight boxes represented therein are as follows :    instrumental calibration : : :    this box contains those aspects of calibration that are necessary for    image processing .",
    "it is here where raw bias frames , dome flats , and    twilight flats are processed and combined to create master bias    frames , dome flats and twilight flats , respectively .",
    "( although the    thickness of the lbnl ccds may mean that @xmath17 and    @xmath18 fringing will not be a problem , it is also here where    fringe frames would be created , if necessary . )",
    "this box is also the    domain where scattered light maps , shutter timing maps , ccd linearity    curves , and chip - to - chip cross - talk corrections would be be created .",
    "photometric monitoring : : :    this box contains the apparatus for independent real - time monitoring    of the photometric quality of the sky .",
    "inputs could include images    from a 10 micron all - sky camera , images from an optical all - sky    camera , or flux measurements from an automated differential image    motion monitor ( dimm ) .",
    "outputs would include diagnostic information    output to a webpage during observations ( for real - time observing    strategy decisions ) and a photometricity flag added to the fits header    of each image ( for off - line decisions relevant to data processing ) .",
    "we    describe photometric monitoring in more detail in section 6 below .",
    "single - frame , astrometry , & catalog modules : : :    here , the raw science and standard star frames are processed using the    master calibration frames , scattered light and shutter timing maps ,    ccd linearity curves , and cross - talk correction coefficients from the    instrumental calibration box .",
    "output is a catalog of objects from each    processed science and standard star frame with measured ra , dec    positions and instrumental magnitudes ( as well as other measured    properties not necessarily of direct importance to calibration ) .",
    "information from photometric monitoring concerning the sky conditions    at the time an image was taken will be carried along with the catalogs    generated from that image .",
    "this information will aid in determining    whether or not data from a that image is used downstream of this box    for photometric calibration .",
    "the single - frame , astrometry , & catalog    modules box represents the main image processing and object detection    portion of the des data processing pipeline ; for more information on    the des data processing pipeline , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nightly absolute calibration : : :    nightly absolute calibration simply refers to the process of fitting    the nightly standard star observations to a photometric equation to    solve for ( for instance ) the nightly photometric zeropoints and    atmospheric extinction coefficients .",
    "input includes the instrumental    magnitudes of standard stars observed on a given night , their    airmasses , and their known standard magnitudes and colors .",
    "the    photometricity flag from photometric monitoring can be used to cull    out standard star observations obtained under non - photometric    conditions .",
    "output from this box includes the photometric zeropoints    and atmospheric extinction coefficients to place the instrumental    magnitudes onto the ab magnitude scale @xcite .",
    "we describe nightly    absolute calibration in more detail in section 7 below .",
    "intermediate calibration : : :    intermediate calibration merely refers to the step of applying the    photometric zeropoints and extinction terms measured in nightly    absolute calibration to all the observations for a given night . the    result is calibrated magnitudes for all the observations on that    night . since these calibrated magnitudes may be `` tweaked '' downstream    of this box , we refer to this step as intermediate calibration .",
    "global relative calibration : : :    global relative calibration concerns measuring two tweaks to the    calibrated magnitudes from the intermediate calibration step , one of    which is a correction to any uncorrected vignetting or scattered light    effects in the photometry ( star flat analysis ) and the other of which    is the calculation of relative field - to - field ( `` hex - to - hex '' )    photometric zeropoint offsets . we describe global relative calibration    in more detail in section 9 below .",
    "global absolute calibration : : :    applying the zeropoint adjustments from the global relative    calibration step might offset the observed standard star magnitudes    from their catalog values .",
    "the global absolute calibration step    calculates the final overall zeropoints needed  one zeropoint per    filter  to place the global relative calibrations onto the ab    magnitude scale .",
    "we describe global absolute calibration in more    detail in section 10 below .",
    "final calibration : : :    here , the zeropoint adjustments from the global relative calibration    and the global absolute calibration step are applied to the science    field observations .",
    "the output is calibrated ab magnitudes for all the    science observations .",
    "after the final calibration step , the des data should be ready for image and/or catalog co - addition to achieve final images and catalogs of the depth required by the des science goals .",
    "barring problems in bookkeeping  and , in particular , barring problems in keeping track of photomeric zeropoint offsets  there should be no need of further calibration steps .",
    "thus , we do not discuss any further steps beyond final calibration in this paper .",
    "let us now discuss some of the above boxes in further detail , starting with photometric monitoring .",
    "not all des imaging will be done under photometric conditions .",
    "those images observed under photometric conditions will be useful both for increasing the magnitude limit of the final co - added survey and for photometric calibration ; those images observed under non - photometric conditions will only be useful for increasing the magnitude limit of the final survey .",
    "therefore , photometric monitoring is necessary .",
    "photometric monitoring should provide real - time estimates of sky conditions for survey strategy .",
    "in other words , real - time photometric monitoring should be able to answer the question , `` should the next image be a photometric calibration ( standard star ) field , a science target , or something else ? ''    photometric monitoring should also provide a quality check or photometricity flag that is usable offline during data processing . in this case , photometric monitoring should be able to provide some sort of measure of the photometric quality of an image already taken and thus be able to answer the question , `` this image was obtained under such conditions ; is it good enough to be used for photometric calibrations ? ''",
    "an excellent resource for all - sky photometric monitoring is a 10 micron all - sky camera .",
    "one of these has been used successfully at apache point observatory ( apo ) , and has proved essential for survey operations and image quality assurance for the sdss @xcite . the 10 micron all - sky camera",
    "has also proved useful for photometric monitoring for observations on the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5 m telescope , also located at apo .",
    "one of the main advantages of the 10 micron all - sky camera over an optical one is that the infrared camera can detect even light cirrus under a full range of moon phases ( from new to full ) ; see fig @xmath23 .",
    "another infrared all - sky camera is being built by joshua bloom and onsi fakhouri for the pairitel telescope at whipple observatory.onsi/clic/ ] currently , there is no 10 micron all - sky camera based at ctio , but there are plans by the des to construct one .",
    "other resources for monitoring the photometricity of the sky include optical all - sky cameras ( like tascadavid / tasca.htm ] and concam ) and the robodimm seeing and flux monitor , which are already available at ctio .",
    "by nightly absolute calibration , we mean fitting observed magnitudes of standard stars to photometric equations for a night s observations .",
    "our standard star observation strategy is currently evolving , but we believe the general plan will be as follows :    1 .   observe 3 standard star fields , each at a different airmass ( @xmath24 ) , between nautical ( 12 ) and astronomical ( 18 ) twilight ( evening and morning ) .",
    "2 .   observe up to 3 more standard star fields ( at various airmasses ) throughout the night .",
    "3 .   also observe standard star fields when the sky is photometric but seeing is too poor for science imaging ( seeing @xmath22 1.1 arcsec fwhm ) .",
    "4 .   use fields with multiple standard stars . 5 .   keep an eye on the photometricity monitors .",
    "the plan for absolute calibration is to calibrate the photometry to the des `` natural '' system . by using the natural system of the telescope@xmath25camera@xmath25filters ,",
    "no system response color terms are needed in the photometric equations , thus simplifying calibration of the imaging data as there is no need to couple science images obtained in different filters .    due to the similarities in the sdss and des",
    "filter response functions , des calibration can be achieved by using sdss @xmath26 and @xmath27 standards transformed into the des @xmath0 natural system . since the sdss @xmath28/@xmath0 and des @xmath0 filter responses are very similar , the transformations from sdss to des should be well behaved .",
    "( strictly speaking , the the filter response curves of the sdss @xmath29 , the sdss @xmath18 , and the des @xmath18 are not as similar ; so transformations from the sdss magnitudes to the des magnitudes may need special treatment . )",
    "this absolute calibration strategy is similar to that employed by the sdss .",
    "although sdss photometry is published in the sdss 2.5 m telescope s @xmath27 natural system , it is in fact calibrated based upon observations of @xmath26 standard stars by the sdss 0.5 m photometric telescope @xcite .",
    "the des will rely on a set of standard stars to establish its absolute calibration .",
    "currently , we plan to rely on two particular sets of standard stars that are now becoming available in the sdss filter system : the southern @xmath26 standards and the sdss stripe 82 @xmath27 standards .",
    "one excellent set of standard stars we plan on using is the southern @xmath26 standard star network of @xcite , observations for which were obtained on the ctio 0.9 m telescope over the 2000  2004 time frame .",
    "this set of standard stars is an extension of the northern@xmath25equatorial @xmath26 standard star network that @xcite established for the photometric calibration of the sdss .",
    "the southern @xmath26 standard star network consists of approximately sixty @xmath30 fields .",
    "each field contains typically several tens of standard stars in the magnitude range @xmath3118 . altogether , there are @xmath316,000 standards stars in southern @xmath26 standard star network .",
    "( further details of the southern @xmath26 standard star network can be found in smith s contribution in this volume . )    for the des , stars as bright as @xmath32 can likely be observed by decam with 5@xmath25 second exposures under conditions of poor seeing or with de - focusing ( fwhm=1.5 ) , making the southern @xmath26 standard star network an essential resource for the photometric calibration of this survey .",
    "one of the priceless data sets that the sdss has provided is stripe 82 , a 2.5-thick region extending along the celestial equator from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( 250 sq deg in total ) .",
    "observable in the northern autumn when the main sdss area ( the northern galactic cap ) is inaccessible , stripe 82 has been imaged @xmath35 under photometric conditions by the sdss 2.5 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the quality and multi - epoch nature of the stripe 82 data make them an ideal source for creating tertiary sdss @xmath27 standard stars .",
    "an effort by ivezi and collaborators has already yielded a stripe 82 standard stars catalog containing @xmath36 @xmath27 tertiary standards  on average @xmath34000 standards per sq deg  in the magnitude range of @xmath37 14.521 ( @xcite ; also see ivezi s contribution in this volume ) .",
    "we note that the sdss stripe 82 is already a part of the des survey region ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is readily observable at a range of airmasses throughout most nights during the des program , and the 2.5width of stripe 82 compares favorably with decam s 2.2-diameter field - of - view .",
    "a stripe 82 standard stars catalog will therefore play a critical role in the photometric calibration of the des .",
    "as the sdss @xmath27 filters becomes more popular , other large scale projects are making use of them and even are creating their own standard star catalogs for these filters .",
    "these include standards for the vst omegacam and for the skymapper survey ( see contributions in this volume by kleign and bessell , respectively ) .",
    "these other sources of standards may also prove useful for the des .",
    "global relative calibrations cover two topics : the removal of any residual photometric effects due to vignetting and/or scattered light ( star flat corrections ) , and the removal of any field - to - field ( `` hex - to - hex '' ) photometric zeropoint offsets due to observing different fields under different photometric conditions .",
    "let us consider each in turn .",
    "due to vignetting and stray light , a detector s response function differs for point sources and extended sources .",
    "standard flat fields ( domes , twilights , skies ) may flatten an image sky background well , but not necessarily the stellar photometry .",
    "this is particularly true of wide - field imagers , in which these effects can produce systematic photometric errors of 1020% or more across an imager s field - of - view .",
    "the solution is to create and apply star flats @xcite .",
    "a star flat can be created simply by offsetting an uncalibrated field ( like an open cluster ) multiple times and then fitting a spatial function to the magnitude differences for matched stars from the different exposures @xcite .",
    "likewise , a star flat can be created by observing a well - calibrated field once and then fitting a spatial function to the observed@xmath38standard magnitudes for the stars in the field @xcite ; this of course assumes the availability of a densely populated standard star field that is at least as wide as the imager s field - of - view . in either case , however it is created , the star flat can then be applied directly to the measured photometry .",
    "the des can profit from both methods of star flat creation .",
    "first , due to its survey strategy of large offsets between each tiling ( see section 9.2 below ) , star flat correction maps can be generated from previously all the uncalibrated stars in the survey area at the end of the survey using the information from the multiple tilings of the full survey region .",
    "second , observations of sdss stripe 82 ( and its dense population of tertiary @xmath27 standard stars ) during normal des operations will permit the creation of high quality star flats very early within the survey . since fields within sdss stripe 82 are targetted throughout the 5-year course of des operations , we will also be able to track any evolution of the star flats themselves over time .",
    "recall from section 3 that the current idea for survey strategy is to cover the entire 5000 sq deg of the survey area twice per year per filter .",
    "each full coverage of the sky in a filter is called a tiling .",
    "the goal is , after 5 years , to have tiled the survey region 5 times each in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , 7 times in @xmath17 , and 13 times in @xmath18 . for a 3 sq deg wide - field camera , it takes @xmath31700 hexes to tile the whole survey area .",
    "our recipe for covering the survey region is as follows ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) :    1 .",
    "tile the survey region .",
    "then , tile the survey region again with the hexes offset half hex over and up ( this gives 30% overlap with three hexes ) .",
    "3 .   repeat , with different offsets .",
    "we note that this recipe is similar to panstarrs strategy ( see magnier s contribution in this volume ) .",
    "the large overlaps provide very robust hex - to - hex relative calibrations .",
    "relative offsets between tiles can be solved for using a large matrix inversion .      to test whether our recipe of multiple offset tilings could achieve our survey requirements of 2% ( 0.02 mag ) all - sky photometry",
    ", we performed a simple survey simulation . for sky conditions",
    ", we assumed @xmath910% variations in photometric zeropoints for the hexes .",
    "for the camera itself , we included a multiplicative flat field gradient of amplitude 3% from east to west across the focal plane , an additive scattered light pattern with a @xmath39 amplitude from the optical axis ( reaching 3% at the edge of the focal plane ) , and an additional additive 3% rms scattered light per individual ccd on the focal plane .",
    "we find that we can indeed achieve our survey requirements after only 2 tilings ; in fact , we can even achieve our enhanced goal of 1% ( 0.01 mag ) all - sky photometry after 5 complete tilings ( see table  1 and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "c c tiling & @xmath14 + & [ mag ] + 1 & 0.035 + 2 & 0.18 + 5 & 0.010 +",
    "for a firm global absolute calibration , we need one or more spectrophotometric standard stars which have been calibrated ( directly or indirectly ) to a nist standard source and an accurately measured total system response for each filter passband for at least one ccd , including filter transmissions , ccd qe responses , optical throughput , and atmospheric transmission .",
    "we then perform synthetic photometry for each of these spectrophotometric standard stars , simply calculating the expected photon flux @xmath40 in each filter passband .",
    "then , we measure the magnitude for each spectrophotometric standard in each filter passband with the blanco@xmath25decam .",
    "finally , for each passband , we can compare the expected magnitude @xmath41 for each standard based upon its expected photon flux @xmath42 against its observed magnitude @xmath43 ; the resulting zeropoint offset can then be applied to the photometry for absolute calibration .    the des filter transmissions , the ccd qes , and the optical throughput for the blanco@xmath25decam can be measured via a monochromator .",
    "( another possibility to measure these is via a tunable dye laser flatfielding system ; please see chris stubbs , david burke s , and yorke brown s contributions to this volume . ) the atmospheric transmission spectrum for ctio has already been measured @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several potentially useful spectrophotometric standards are available ( e.g. , gd  71 , g158 - 100 , gd  50 , and g162 - 66 ) .",
    "all are white dwarf spectrophotometric standards , all are visible from ctio , and all are faint enought ( @xmath44)that they will not saturate the decam at exposure times of 5 sec for seeing / focus of 1.5 arcsec fwhm . therefore , most of the information for global absolute calibration is either already in hand ( e.g. , ctio atmospheric transmission spectra and well - calibrated spectrophotometric standards ) or will eventually be available ( e.g. , des filter transmission curve measurements , decam ccd qes , blanco@xmath25decam optical throughputs . )",
    "we have discussed the dark energy survey ( des ) and the current plans for its photometric calibration . to achieve the survey",
    "s science goals , all - sky photometry of 2% ( 0.02 mag ) rms is required , with an enhanced goal of 1% ( 0.01 ) rms . this is a challenging but achieveable goal ."
