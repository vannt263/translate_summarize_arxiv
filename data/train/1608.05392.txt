    "the study of the mode - decomposition of linear field perturbations of spherical ( schwarzschild ) and axially - symmetric ( kerr ) black hole spacetimes has a long history in the general relativity literature .",
    "such study has been applied to a broad range of astrophysical questions such as stability of black holes ( e.g. ,  @xcite in schwarzschild spacetime and  @xcite in kerr spacetime ) , the self - force on a point particle moving on a curved background  @xcite and the end stages of gravitational collapse and of mergers of black holes .",
    "these end stages typically present an exponentially - decaying ` ringdown ' in the field ( which was observed in the historical detection of gravitational waves by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory  @xcite ) followed by a late - time behaviour .",
    "the late - time behaviour of scalar ( spin-@xmath3 ) , electromagnetic ( spin-@xmath4 ) and gravitational ( spin-@xmath5 ) field perturbations was first presented by price @xcite , in the case of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "price found that the multipole-@xmath2 field moments behave at late times ( and fixed radius ) as a power law decay of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the standard schwarzschild time and @xmath2 is the field multipole .",
    "this has henceforth been referred to as the late - time power law - tail of the schwarzschild black hole and can be interpreted astrophysically as the method with which a star undergoing spherically - symmetric gravitational collapse settles down finally into a black hole with ` no hair ' ( i.e. , its only conserved charges are its mass and  if it possesses any  its angular momentum and electrical charge ) .",
    "the mathematics of this calculation was refined by leaver @xcite via an analysis in the complex - frequency domain of the retarded green function of the wave equation satisfied by the field . by deforming the fourier - integration contour in the complex - frequency plane ,",
    "leaver identified the source of the power law as coming from the branch cut that the fourier modes of the green function possess .",
    "in particular , he noted that it was the low - frequency asymptotics of the branch cut that gave the dominant contribution to the green function at late times . using this insight into the nature of the decay tail ,",
    "hod calculated the leading - order branch cut contribution in kerr spacetime finding the decay tail for fields of spin-@xmath3 , -@xmath4 and -@xmath5 , all at asymptotic null infinity , timelike infinity and at the event horizon @xcite .",
    "the result at timelike infinity is that all scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational fields decay at late times as @xmath0 , where @xmath8 is the boyer - lindquist coordinate and @xmath2 is the multipole number corresponding to a decomposition in spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics . in a parallel series of works , barack and ori also calculated the leading order decay tail in kerr spacetime : in  @xcite for the scalar field at null infinity , timelike infinity and on the event horizon , and in  @xcite for the electromagnetic and gravitational fields on the event horizon .",
    "their analysis however , was performed in the time domain , and in contrast to hod s results , was valid at arbitrary radii .",
    "recently , it has been observed  @xcite that an additional branch cut in the case of extreme kerr gives rise to an instability at late times of the event horizon of this black hole , thus generalizing previous results by aretakis for axisymmetric perturbations  @xcite .",
    "further to these works , there have also been many numerical investigations of the decay tails in kerr spacetime in various asymptotic regimes .",
    "much difficulty is encountered in these simulations due to different choices of co - ordinates and harmonic bases , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "while the above results provide much physical insight into the nature of disturbances to the spacetime , they are not entirely sufficient for the applications of black hole perturbation theory to the calculation of the self - force .",
    "the calculation of the self - force is important in order to model accurately the emission of gravitational waves by a black hole inspiral in the extreme ( or even intermediate  @xcite ) mass - ratio regime ( emris and imris ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "the self - force was calculated in the case of a scalar charge on schwarschild spacetime by integrating the green function over the past worldline of the charge .",
    "the green function , in its turn , was calculated via leaver s technique of contour - deformation and it was observed that , for the branch cut contribution , the leading low - frequency asymptotics was not sufficient in order to obtain the self - force accurately ` enough ' .",
    "it was discovered that while the exponentially decaying quasi - normal modes are dominant at intermediate times , the omission of the branch cut at these times ( which comes from the branch cut modes to higher order in the frequency , as calculated in , e.g. ,  @xcite ) can lead to noticable errors , dispelling the identification of the branch cut with solely late times .",
    "a more accurate statement would be that the branch cut becomes _ dominant _ at late times .",
    "combining leaver s technique with the advances in analytic black hole perturbation theory provided by the method of mano , suzuki and tagoshi ( mst ) @xcite , two of us were able to calculate the higher order corrections to price s decay tail in schwarzschild spacetime at arbitrary radii @xcite .",
    "in calculating the corrections , it was shown that the purely power - law nature , @xmath6 , is ` corrupted ' by logarithmic terms at next - to - next - to - leading order , @xmath9 .",
    "these terms allowed for a better approximation of the global green function in schwarzschild spacetime needed for the past - history integral found in self force calculations , such as that in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present an extension of the calculation of  @xcite to ( sub - extremal ) kerr spacetime .",
    "we develop the mst method for the calculation of the branch cut contribution to the retarded green function for field perturbations of general integer spin in kerr .",
    "we then apply this formalism to calculate explicitly the late - time behaviour of a massless scalar field up to five orders .",
    "we use boyer - lindquist time @xmath8 .",
    "our leading order agrees with the literature results in kerr , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "we then find that a new logarithmic correction appears at next - to - next - to - leading order , i.e. , @xmath1 , as in schwarzschild .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the fundamentally independent evaluation of the green function via a real - frequency evaluation of the fourier integral .",
    "the layout of the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sec : gf ] we introduce the retarded green function of the teukolsky equation for spin - field perturbations of kerr space - time . in sec.[eq : mst ] we summarize the main mst equations , already given in the literature , and which we need for later on . in sec.[sec : gf compl ] we introduce the deformation of the frequency - integral into the complex frequency plane . in sec.[sec : bc ] we develop the formalism for the branch cut integral and obtain analytical expressions for the green function modes along the branch cut .",
    "we obtain small - frequency expansions of the radius - independent part of these modes in sec.[sec : low freq r - indep ] and of the radial functions in sec.[sec : low freq r - dep ] .",
    "we put together these results in sec.[sec : late - time ] , where we give the late - time tail of the green function up to the first five orders .",
    "we conclude the main body in sec.[sec : disc ] with a discussion .",
    "we have two appendices . in app.[sec : angularcuts ] we show that extra branch cuts that the angular eigenvalues and eigenfunctions have do not contribute to the green function after summing over @xmath2 . in app.[sec : mstexpansions ] we give small - frequency expansions for the series coefficients and for mst s so - called renormalized angular momentum parameter .",

    "teukolsky also showed that , in the frequency domain , his equation can be separated into radial and angular components by using the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics .",
    "for the green function this is achieved by writing @xmath32 for some @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics  @xcite .",

    "analytical progress can be made by means of a contour deformation on the complex - frequency plane of the real - frequency fourier integral .",
    "leaver gave significant insight into the green function in schwarzschild spacetime by such deformation @xcite .",
    "when deforming the contour , one must take into account the singularities of the fourier modes of the green function as dictated by cauchy s theorem . in schwarzschild space - time , the singularities of the fourier modes are : simple poles ( quasi - normal modes ) and a branch point at the origin with a corresponding branch cut typically taken down the negative imaginary axis .",
    "the contour deformation then means that the green function may be obtained by the sum of the following contributions : ( 1 ) a sum over the residues at the poles , ( 2 ) an integral along a high - frequency arc and ( 3 ) an integral around a branch cut along the negative frequency axis . in his work , leaver identified the low frequency portion of the branch cut integral with the late time behaviour of the green function . in kerr",
    "spacetime , while the significant features of the poles giving qnms and a branch cut leading to a late time tail remain , one also must account for branch points ",

    "[ sec : angularcuts ] we show that these angular branch cuts are , however , spurious artefacts of the spheroidal decomposition , which will vanish when we do the infinite sum over @xmath2 to obtain the full green function .",

    "theory of laplace transforms  @xcite , this late - time behaviour will be dictated , after performing a laplace transform on the green function , by the uppermost singularities in the complex frequency plane of the green function modes . in the next section",
    "we argue that the only ` physical ' branch point in subextremal kerr space - time is that at the origin , @xmath106 . furthermore",
    ", whiting  @xcite showed that there are no exponentially growing modes ( i.e. , with positive imaginary frequency ) in subextremal kerr .",
    "finally , on energy - conservation grounds , no quasi - normal modes may have real and non - superradiant frequency ( i.e. , @xmath107 and @xmath108 )  @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that the late - time behaviour of the green function is given by the green function modes near @xmath106 .    our strategy for calculating the late - time behaviour of the green function will be as follows :    1 .",
    "express the discontinuity across the branch cut in the frequency domain radial green function in terms of the discontinuity of the upgoing homogeneous solution ; 2 .   find an analytic expression for the discontinuity in the upgoing homogeneous solution in terms of known mst quantities ; 3 .",
    "use this to calculate the induced discontinuity in the wronskian ; 4 .   explicitly compute a low - frequency expansion of the branch cut contribution to the green function ; 5 .",
    "integrate the above branch cut expansion to obtain the behaviour of the green function at late times .    in sec.[sec : bc ] we deal with the above point 1 ( see , specifically , eq.([eq : gbc ] ) ) , point 2 ( see eqs.([eq : disc ruphat ] ) , ( [ eq : q eqtn ] ) ) and point 3 ( see eqs.([eq : wp])([eq : wpwm ] ) ) .",
    "in sec.[sec : low freq r - indep ] we deal with point 4 for the radius - independent part and in sec.[sec : low freq r - dep ] for the radius - dependent part .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec : late - time ] we will deal with point 5 above .",
    "by a simple rescaling of the dependent variable , the radial eq . ( [ eq : radial teuk . eq . ] ) can be rewritten in schrdinger - like form ( see eqs.2.2 and 2.13  @xcite ) . it is easy to show that the potential in this schrdinger - like equation goes like a constant term plus a term exponentially decreasing with the independent variable as the horizon is approached .",
    "this means that , following the heuristic arguments in  @xcite , the radial solution @xmath54 is not expected to have a branch point at @xmath109 on the other hand , the potential , after excluding the centrifugal barrier , goes like @xmath110 plus a term that decays slower than exponentially as radial infinity is approached .",
    "this means that @xmath55 is expected  @xcite to have a branch point at the origin of the complex - frequency plane ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the mst series for the ` in ' and ` up ' radial solutions confirm the above expectations .",
    "we first deal with the ` in ' solutions . the representation in eq.([eq : rin 2f1 ] ) for ` in ' is in terms of hypergeometric functions which manifestly have no branch point in the complex - frequency plane , given their analyticity properties as functions of their first three arguments  @xcite .",
    "the series coefficients @xmath75 and the renormalized angular momentum @xmath74 , which appear in eq.([eq : rin 2f1 ] ) , are also functions of @xmath111 .",
    "we show later on , however , that , at least to the order in @xmath78 to which we calculate them , these quantities possess no discontinuity along the negative imaginary axis .",
    "in fact , we believe that these quantities have no discontinuity anywhere along the negative imaginary axis , as also expected by leaver in  @xcite , or , at least , that if they happen to have any discontinuities along the negative imaginary axis , then these do not contribute to the full green function ( e.g. , they posses angular branch points , which , not only are away from the origin but also , as we show in app .  [",
    "sec : angularcuts ] , they do not contribute to the full green function ) .",
    "alternatively , one could use the jaff series representation  @xcite of the ` in ' solutions ( see also eq.73  @xcite for the ` up ' solutions ) , which does not depend on @xmath74 , although it has different series coeffiicients whose analytic properties should be investigated . for the ` up ' radial solution ,",
    "let us consider its series representation eq.([eq : rup series u ] ) in terms of the irregular confluent hypergeometric functions @xmath112 .",
    "these special functions contain a branch point at the origin of their third argument  @xcite . in our case",

    "the asymptotic behaviour at radial infinity of the ` up ' radial solution is the same in the limit of the frequency approaching the negative imaginary axis from the third or the fourth quadrant : @xmath121 this implies that the difference between the two must be subdominant at infinity : @xmath122 therefore , this difference must be proportional to the ( normalised ) linearly independent solution @xmath123 : @xmath124 where the constant of proportionality is a ` branch cut strength ' function , @xmath125 . note that @xmath125 is a real - valued function in schwarzschild spacetime  @xcite but in kerr spacetime we have no reason to expect this .",
