    "navier - stokes equations define an infinite dimensional dynamical system .",
    "turbulence can be represented through a chaotic solution in the infinite dimensional phase spaces . for example",
    ", one can take the sobolev spaces @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) to be the phase spaces .",
    "a basic dynamical system question is : does the phase space foliate under the ns flow ? that is ,",
    "are there invariant manifolds under the ns flow ?",
    "the answer is yes . it seems that under the euler flow , which can be obtained from the ns flow by setting viscosity to zero , the phase space does not foliate . to begin a dynamical system study",
    ", one chooses a common steady state of the ns and its corresponding euler equation , defined on a periodic spatial domain . at this steady state ,",
    "the spectra of the linear ns and the linear euler are dramatically different .",
    "the linear ns has the form : @xmath5 relatively compact terms , therefore , it has only a point spectrum via weyl s essential spectrum theorem . on the other hand",
    ", the linear euler has a nontrivial essential spectrum . for 2d linear euler ,",
    "if the steady state as a vector field has a saddle , then the essential spectrum in the sobolev space @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) is a vertical band symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis @xcite .",
    "the width of the band ( @xmath7 for some @xmath8 ) increases with @xmath9 , representing the fact of cascade and inverse cascade .",
    "a typical example of such steady states is the cat s eye .",
    "if the steady state has no saddle , but has at least two centers , then the essential spectrum in the sobolev space @xmath0 is the imaginary axis @xcite .",
    "a typical example of such steady states is the shear @xcite @xcite .",
    "for the shear , a sharp upper bound on the number of eigenvalues was also obtained @xcite . for 3d linear euler ,",
    "the spectrum is an open problem .",
    "a nice example of the steady states is the abc flow vector field .",
    "an interesting open problem is to understand the connection between the spectra of linear ns and linear euler as @xmath2 .",
    "besides the progresses mentioned above in understanding the spectra of linear euler , progresses were also made in better understanding of the spectra of linear ns , although they were in a different setting .",
    "for both 2d and 3d ns posed in @xmath10 ( in terms of weak solutions ) on a bounded domain with non - slip boundary condition , prodi @xcite proved that the eigenvalues of the linear ns at a steady state lie inside a parabolic region @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are some constants , and @xmath14 is the spectral parameter .",
    "moreover , david sattinger @xcite proved that the linear ns has infinitely many eigenvalues lying in the parabolic region , each of finite multiplicity , which can cluster only at infinity , and the corresponding eigenfunctions ( and higher order eigenfunctions ) form a complete basis in @xmath10 .",
    "similar results are proved in the current article for a periodic domain and mild solutions in @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the proof involves some deep result from hilbert - schmidt operators .",
    "together with some deep result from sectorial operator , we prove the existence of invariant manifolds .",
    "in terms of well - posedness of navier - stokes equations ( ns ) , zero - viscosity limit problem has been extensively studied @xcite @xcite .",
    "here we are also interested in the zero - viscosity limit ( @xmath2 ) problem for invariant manifolds .",
    "it is proved in this article that under an assumption , their sizes are of order @xmath3 or @xmath15 as @xmath2 .",
    "existence of invariant manifolds for euler equations is still open .",
    "i tend to believe that invariant manifolds for euler equations do not exist , at least not in the usual sense .",
    "an intuitive argument is as follows : kato s technique @xcite for proving the existence of a mild solution to euler equations amounts to writing the solution as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the velocity , and the leray projection and the external force are not included , which do not affect the argument .",
    "notice that the @xmath18 in the exponent depends upon @xmath19 , therefore , one should only expect the evolution operator of euler equations to be at best @xmath20 in @xmath19 , just as in @xmath21 . on the other hand , the existence of an invariant manifold is really an at least @xmath22 in @xmath19 phenomenon .",
    "one can obtain expressions of invariant manifolds around a shear for a galerkin truncation of the euler equation @xcite , which exhibit a lip structure .    for concrete examples , e.g. single mode steady states ,",
    "a continued fraction technique can be designed for calculating the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations were conducted by vincent liu @xcite @xcite .",
    "liu obtained rather detailed information on unstable eigenvalues . in some case ,",
    "liu showed that as @xmath2 , the unstable eigenvalue does converge to that of linear euler . in this article , besides the example of liu , we will study two more examples .",
    "for the first example , a complete eigenvalue information is obtained , and the existence of unstable and stable manifolds is proved without any assumption . for the second example , only partial information on the eigenvalues is obtained , as in the example of liu .    the article is organized as follows : in section 2 , we will present the formulation of the problems .",

    "<S> first we prove a general spectral theorem for the linear navier - stokes ( ns ) operator in both 2d and 3d . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral theorem says that the spectrum consists of only eigenvalues which lie in a parabolic region , and the eigenfunctions ( and higher order eigenfunctions ) form a complete basis in @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we prove the existence of invariant manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> we are also interested in a more challenging problem , i.e. studying the zero - viscosity limits ( @xmath2 ) of the invariant manifolds . under an assumption </S>",
    "<S> , we can show that the sizes of the unstable manifold and the center - stable manifold of a steady state are @xmath3 , while the sizes of the stable manifold , the center manifold , and the center - unstable manifold are @xmath4 , as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study three examples . </S>",
    "<S> the first example is defined on a rectangular periodic domain , and has only one unstable eigenvalue which is real . a complete estimate on this eigenvalue </S>",
    "<S> is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> existence of an 1d unstable manifold and a codim 1 stable manifold is proved without any assumption . for the other two examples , partial estimates on the eigenvalues are obtained .    </S>",
