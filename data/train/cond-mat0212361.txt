    "the frequency - dependent conductivity @xmath1 provides one of the most valuable and detailed information on the charge dynamics in a wide class of materials .",
    "it is analyzed using either the one - component or two - component models @xcite .",
    "the two - component model interprets the @xmath1 as arising from a combination of two types of carriers , free and bound ones .",
    "the free carriers are modeled in terms of the drude term and the bound ones in terms of various lorentzian oscillators . however , the interpretation of the individual lorentzian terms , most of which are usually due to inter - band contributions , is not straightforward .    in the one - component picture ,",
    "referred to as the extended drude model ( edm ) , on the other hand , the frequency dependence of the conductivity @xmath1 below inter - band contributions is described by extending the phenomenological parameters of the drude model , the effective mass @xmath2 and scattering rate @xmath3 , to be frequency dependent as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron band mass .",
    "the edm interprets the experimentally obtained complex conductivity @xmath1 in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 determined by [ edmpara ] = re ,   = - i m , where @xmath8 is the plasma frequency , @xmath9 the electron density , and @xmath10 is the electron charge .",
    "the @xmath11 can be found by integrating the real part of the measured conductivity from the sum rule _ 0^_maxd_1 ( ) = 18 _ p^2 , [ sum - rule ] where @xmath12 is the cutoff frequency above which inter - band contributions begin to contribute .",
    "the subscript 1 and 2 refer to , respectively , the real and imaginary parts .",
    "the edm has been successfully employed to analyze @xmath1 of the conventional metals as well as the heavy - fermions and high-@xmath13 cuprates @xcite .    for a class of correlated electron systems such as the ruthunates ,",
    "sr / caruo@xmath14 , however , the edm breaks down and yields unphysical descriptions of the materials such as the negative effective mass @xcite .",
    "similar behavior is also found for some molybdates , sm@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath15 and nd@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these observations clearly signal the inadequacy of the edm and call for a new way of analyzing @xmath1 which can be applied to a wide class of materials .",
    "we , therefore , propose to analyze the frequency dependent infrared ( ir ) conductivity in terms of the electron self - energy @xmath16 instead of the phenomenological parameters of eq .",
    "( [ edmpara ] ) .",
    "the electron self - energy contains the full information on the coherent and incoherent parts of interacting electrons and , therefore , can describe the charge dynamics even when the edm or the fermi liquid ( fl ) picture is no longer valid . in this self - energy analysis ( sea )",
    "method , the electron self - energy is extracted by inverting the experimentally measured infrared conductivity through the functional minimization and numerical iterations as will be discussed in detail in section iii .",
    "the sea may be considered as a microscopic generalization of the edm , which can be applied to analyze the frequency - dependent conductivity data of the non - fermi liquids as well as the fermi liquids . even for",
    "the fl where the edm is expected to work , the sea can yield quantitatively more reliable results than the edm , especially for the fl with a strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the present paper is mainly devoted to a detailed description of the sea method and its applications to relatively simple metals . for more complicated cases of strongly correlated electron systems including cuprates , molybdates and ruthunates , by which we were originally motivated",
    ", we plan to report the sea results separately elsewhere . for these systems ,",
    "qualitatively different results from the edm results are expected .",
    "after the introduction , we will discuss the frequency - dependent conductivity @xmath1 expressed in terms of the self - energy @xmath16 and its relation with the edm in sec .",
    "this will clarify the inherent limitations of the widely employed edm analysis for the frequency - dependent conductivity .",
    "we will then describe in sec .",
    "iii the formulation of the sea method , which is reduced to the global minimization of a @xmath17-variable function .",
    "the sea method will be applied to experimental data of pb , nb and mgb@xmath0 and the results are presented in comparison with the edm analysis in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we give a brief summary and some perspectives on the self - energy analysis method .",
    "the frequency - dependent conductivity @xmath1 can be obtained from the current - current correlation function , and is written in terms of the electron self - energy @xmath16 as @xcite [ calculation ] ( ) = ^_- d , where @xmath18 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "we assumed a constant density of states over an infinite bandwidth and no long - range order .",
    "it is also assumed that the momentum dependence is much weaker compared with the frequency dependence , @xmath19 , as in the dynamical mean - field theory , which renders the vertex correction vanish in the current - current correlation function @xcite .",
    "the electron self - energy represents the effects of electron interaction with various excitations in a system .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy can be written as [ a2f ] _ 2 ( ) & = & -^_-dp_2 ( ) + _ 2^imp , where @xmath20 is the frequency - independent contribution from impurities .",
    "@xmath21 is the imaginary part of the effective interaction satisfying @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the temperature .",
    "the isotropically weighted phonon density of states for electron - phonon coupled systems is given by [ alpha2f ] ^2 f ( ) = 1p_2 ( ) .",
    "once the self - energy is known , we use eq .",
    "( [ a2f ] ) to find the effective interaction spectrum @xmath24 using a derivative with respect to @xmath25 at low @xmath23 or a convolution after fourier transformations @xcite .    in the zero temperature limit @xmath26 , the @xmath1 of eq.([calculation ] )",
    "is reduced to [ sigmat0 ] ( ) = _ 0^d , which means that in the low @xmath23 limit , only the self - energy @xmath27 between @xmath28 contributes to the conductivity at @xmath25 .",
    "this may be interpreted as @xmath1 being an `` average '' of @xmath29 $ ] between 0 and @xmath25 .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that the information from the edm analysis , which is directly obtained from @xmath1 using eq .",
    "( [ edmpara ] ) , is an average of the corresponding quantity from the sea .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the edm can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ calculation ] ) in an appropriate limit .",
    "the @xmath1 of eq.([calculation ] ) is reduced to the edm form of eq.([drude ] ) with @xmath30 provided that [ edmcondition ] ( -)+ ( ) -()-i/ ( ) is satisfied @xcite . for a fl , where @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ", this condition can be satisfied for small @xmath33 and @xmath34 , if @xmath35 has a weak @xmath25-dependence .",
    "therefore , the edm can give a satisfactory description of @xmath1 for weak - coupling fl , where [ mapping ] -2 _ 2 ( ) ,   1 + ( ) 1- . in the weak - coupling limit , where eq .",

    "we will not distinguish the @xmath38 and @xmath37 from now on .",
    "we note that there were several previous attempts to invert @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "for instance , one may obtain @xmath38 in the @xmath39 limit of eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) using [ a2f - approx ] ^2f ( ) re , where the second expression follows by using the edm of eq.([drude ] ) .",
    "this formula , however , has limitations to be applied to the experimental ir data because large error bars are inevitable from the double differentials and it is valid only when edm is valid and at @xmath40 @xcite .    for strong - coupling fl where @xmath35 has a significant @xmath25-dependence , analysis based on",
    "the edm becomes less accurate .",
    "for the marginal fermi liquid , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the edm is expected to give somewhat less reliable description because @xmath43 , unlike fl , deviates from the linearity in @xmath25 . the situation becomes worse for non - fermi liquid , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , and the edm may give misleading and qualitatively incorrect descriptions as were observed in the ruthnates @xcite .",
    "we now present how one can analyze the frequency - dependent infrared conductivity with the formula of eq.([calculation ] ) .",
    "as is explained below , the problem is reduced to a global minimization of a @xmath17-variable function . using eq.([calculation ] ) , it is simple to calculate the conductivity @xmath1 from a given self - energy @xmath16 .",
    "what we are trying to do here is exactly the inverse of that : we wish to extract @xmath16 from an experimentally measured @xmath1 .",
    "the sea is implemented by defining the functional @xmath47 $ ] as @xmath48 \\equiv \\int_0^{\\omega_c } d\\omega \\left [ \\sigma_1 ( \\omega ) - \\sigma_1^{exp}(\\omega ) \\right ] ^2 \\/ ,   \\label{master}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the real parts of the experimental data and calculated conductivity using eq.([calculation ] ) , respectively .",
    "since the real part of self - energy @xmath51 can be obtained from the imaginary part @xmath52 by the kramers - kronig transformation , we can consider @xmath53 as the only independent function .",
    "the functional @xmath54 is positive definite , and has the global minimum of zero for the self - energy which reproduces the experimental conductivity data .",
    "the self - energies defined at the @xmath17 discrete frequencies , @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , are taken as the @xmath17 independent variables of the function @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the cutoff frequency @xmath59 is not necessarily equal to the @xmath60 of eq.([sum - rule ] ) .",
    "now , the problem is reduced to a global minimization of a @xmath17-variable function .",
    "we note that , depending on the problems , other forms of the functional @xmath54 may yield better results . for good metals , for instance ,",
    "whose mid - ir conductivity is very small compared with far - ir region , w=_0^_c d [ _ 1 ( ) -_1^exp()]^2 works better than the form of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) . for the region",
    "where @xmath61 , which we need to know for the kramers - kronig transformation , @xmath62 is taken as constant .",
    "a constant @xmath52 for @xmath63 corresponds to the reflectivity @xmath64 , which is consistent with the standard procedure in the ir experiments .",
    "the global minimization of @xmath54 is achieved via the functional derivative and numerical iterations .",
    "we start with an initial configuration of @xmath65 .",
    "a good initial guess can be @xmath66 obtained from edm analysis , or a negative constant value for the whole frequency range .",
    "then , we move to new @xmath67 along the steepest descent direction of @xmath54 .",
    "[ iteration ] x_i^(new ) = x_i^(old ) - .",

    "the step size @xmath71 is chosen such that the @xmath54 is maximally decreased along the steepest descent direction .",
    "the @xmath72 , which sets the scale of @xmath1 of eq .  ( [ calculation ] )",
    "is updated at each iteration such that the calculated spectral sum is equal to the experimental spectral sum up to @xmath59 .",
    "note that this way of determining @xmath11 does @xmath73 require that @xmath74 of eq .",
    "( [ sum - rule ] ) and , therefore , the extracted @xmath11 is almost independent of @xmath12 and more reliable than that from the sum rule of eq.([sum - rule ] ) .",
    "this enables us to determine @xmath11 more systematically as we will discuss in more detail below .    in general",
    ", the global minimization of a few hundred independent variables is an extremely demanding problem . in the present case , however , it is rendered tractable because of the following observations : ( 1 ) we know the value of the global minimum unlike general global minimization problems .",
    "it is exactly zero .",
    "( 2 ) we have some ideas about the physically meaningful form of the @xmath62 .",
    "it should be a continuous function of the frequency and negative definite .",
    "( 3 ) we have a better way to escape from local minima than trying a new random starting point , @xmath65 : take @xmath75 .",
    "an estimation of this process can be obtained in following way . the contribution to the conductivity at a given frequency @xmath25",
    "is dominated by the self - energy below @xmath25 in the low temperature limit due to the thermal factor of @xmath76/\\omega$ ] of eq .",
    "( [ calculation ] ) as discussed in eq .",
    "( [ sigmat0 ] ) . by modifying the self - energy to be proportional to the difference between calculated conductivity and the experimental data at each frequency",
    ", we can continue our minimization modifying the ` wrong ' region without spoiling a ` good ' region .",
    "from the extracted @xmath16 , other physical properties such as the plasma frequency , effective interaction between electrons , raman spectra , and inelastic neutron scattering intensity can also be calculated .",
    "for instance , we use eq.([a2f ] ) to find the effective interaction spectrum @xmath77 from an extracted @xmath53 which was discussed in the previous section .",
    "an important byproduct of the sea is that the plasma frequency @xmath11 can be determined more accurately than has been @xmath78 practiced , which is necessary to determine the drude parameters of eq.([edmpara ] ) .",
    "conventionally , @xmath11 is determined by @xmath12 of eq .",
    "( [ sum - rule ] ) which , in turn , is taken such that the sum as a function of @xmath12 has the smallest slope .",
    "this procedure can be problematic especially for the materials without a sharp plasma edge in the reflectivity data .",
    "in contrast , sea works in this case as well because the determination of @xmath11 , which sets the scale of @xmath1 , is almost @xmath79 of the @xmath59 of the functional @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , one can determine @xmath11 with only very restricted data between @xmath80 .",
    "this will be illustrated for nb below .",
    "another byproduct closely related to the @xmath11 determination is that we may separate the intra- and inter - band contributions more systematically .",
    "we can extract the self - energy of effective single - component carriers by fitting the low - frequency experimental conductivity up to @xmath81 .",
    "the conductivity @xmath1 calculated by substituting the extracted @xmath16 into eq .",
    "( [ calculation ] ) is intra - band conductivity .",
    "this process , however , is more sensitive to @xmath59 than the @xmath11 determination .",
    "we will demonstrate in the next section that the sea is straightforward to implement to extract the self - energy from experimental ir conductivity without the local minimum problem .",
    "we have found that the sea yields the same solution @xmath82 from almost any initial configuration .",
    "the obtained solution @xmath62 , therefore , seems unique .",
    "we will now apply the sea developed in the previous section to real materials , and demonstrate that it can be readily employed to analyze the frequency - dependent ir experimental data . in the first two parts of this section",
    ", we will analyze the simple metals , pb and nb . from the sea , we can extract the self - energy of the materials , and from the extracted self - energy we can find the @xmath83 using eqs .",
    "( [ a2f ] ) and ( [ alpha2f ] ) .",
    "it can be compared with the measured @xmath84 well established from the tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "but for such a good metal , it is a very demanding task to measure the conductivity in far - ir region , since the reflectivity is very close to 100 % there .",
    "thus there exist few published conductivity data for pb and nb . for pb , we take the experimental @xmath83 obtained from the tunneling experiment and calculate the self - energy from eqs .  ( [ a2f ] ) and ( [ alpha2f ] ) , and then calculate the conductivity from eq .",
    "( [ calculation ] ) .",
    "this is taken as the `` experimental '' conductivity @xmath85 for pb .",
    "after that , the real experimental data of nb is analyzed @xcite .",
    "the results are compared with those obtained from the tunneling spectra .",
    "the last part of this section is devoted to the sea for the normal state ir conductivity data of mgb@xmath0 superconductor .",
    "we will argue from the sea results that the small electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath86 extracted previously from the @xmath23-dependence of the resistivity @xmath87 and edm analysis of @xmath1 , which is too small to account for the superconducting transition temperature @xmath13 , is most likely due to an underestimate of the plasma frequency @xmath11 .",
    "we take pb as a test case of the proposed sea because its @xmath83 is well established from the tunneling @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath86 of this metal is known to be @xmath88 .",
    "the frequency - dependent ir conductivity of pb , however , is not available .",
    "therefore , the ir conductivity data was generated with eqs .",
    "( [ calculation ] ) and ( [ a2f ] ) using the tunneling @xmath38 at 200 frequencies up to @xmath89 mev with an equal spacing .",
    "we took the self - energy due to impurity scattering @xmath90 mev and @xmath91 k as representative values . the generated conductivity in this way , shown in the left column of fig .  1 with open circle ,",
    "is taken as the `` experimental '' data @xmath92 .",
    "it was then fitted by the sea as explained above to extract the self - energy @xmath93 without , of course , any information about the self - energy used to generate the conductivity .",

    "this is expected because @xmath6 is an `` average '' of the @xmath62 as discussed previously in section ii .",
    "the curve shown by the thin solid line in the lower picture was calculated by using the approximate formula eq .",

    "the answer seems positive : the converged solutions , with different initial configurations , of given conductivity data all agree with each other .",
    "this means that the extracted self - energy @xmath82 is indeed unique .",
    "second , we have also checked if there is any spurious feature from the kramers - kronig transformation used in the present work to obtain the real part of the self - energy from the imaginary part .",
    "we therefore have fitted the complex conductivity by treating both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath16 as independent variables , which eliminates the use of kramers - kronig .",
    "this gives the same @xmath62 with the procedure using @xmath47 $ ] , demonstrating the reliability of the present method .",
    "third , we plan to report results of the self - energy analysis of the conductivity for other correlated electron systems such as the high @xmath13 superconductors , sm@xmath0/nd@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath15 , and ca / srruo@xmath14 mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the differences between the self - energy analysis and the extended drude model analysis are expected to be @xmath133 for the fermi liquids , but be @xmath134 for the non - fermi liquids .",
    "it will therefore be very interesting to see what information the self - energy analysis provide for the strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "also among the plan are extending the self - energy analysis to non constant density of states and broken symmetry states , and doing the analysis for other two - particle probes such as the electronic raman and inelastic neutron spectra .",
    "we believe that the self - energy analysis seems timely and urgent in view of the mounting interests in the correlated electron or non - fermi liquid systems for which the phenomenological analyses may yield inadequate results .",

    "<S> we propose and demonstrate a microscopic way to analyze the frequency - dependent infrared conductivity : extraction of the electron self - energy from the inversion of experimentally measured infrared conductivity through the functional minimization and numerical iterations . </S>",
    "<S> the self - energy contains the full information on the coherent and incoherent parts of interacting electrons and , therefore , can describe their charge dynamics even when the quasi - particle concept is not valid . from the extracted self - energy , other physical properties such as the raman intensity spectrum and the effective interaction between electrons can also be computed . </S>",
    "<S> we will first demonstrate that the self - energy analysis can be successfully implemented by fitting the frequency - dependent condcutivities of the simple metals such as pb and nb , and then calculating the effective interactions between electrons from the extracted self - energies and comparing them with those obtained from the tunneling experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we then present the self - energy analysis of the mgb@xmath0 superconductors in normal state and clarify some of the controversies in their optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the small electron - phonon coupling constant obtained previously is attributed to an underestimate of the plasma frequency . </S>"
