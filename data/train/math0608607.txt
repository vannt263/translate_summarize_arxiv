    "the problem of avoiding repetitions in words was first studied by thue @xcite , who constructed an infinite word over a ternary alphabet containing no squares of the form @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we generalize this notion by constructing infinite words containing no squares in any subsequence indexed by an arithmetic progression of odd difference .",
    "to do so , we make use of several other generalizations of thue s problem .    while it is easy to see that any binary word of length at least @xmath0 must contain a square , entringer , jackson , and schatz @xcite constructed an infinite binary word containing no squares @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "prodinger and urbanek @xcite gave an example of an infinite binary word whose only squares are of lengths @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 .",
    "the particular word studied by prodinger and urbanek is the well - known ( ordinary ) paperfolding word @xmath7 paperfolding words in general have been studied extensively @xcite ; we will rely in particular on the results of allouche and bousquet - mlou @xcite .",
    "taking thue s problem in another direction , carpi @xcite , as a preliminary step in constructing non - repetitive labelings of the integer lattice , considered the question of the existence of infinite words that avoid squares in all subsequences indexed by arithmetic progressions .",
    "of course , by the classical theorem of van der waerden @xcite , no such words exist , but carpi showed that for any prime @xmath8 , there exists an infinite word over a finite alphabet that avoids squares in arithmetic progressions of all differences , except those differences that are a multiple of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath9 , there exists an infinite word over a @xmath0-letter alphabet that contains no squares in any arithmetic progression of odd difference .",
    "as we shall see later , carpi s construction has a surprising connection to the paperfolding words .",
    "another notion of significance in the study of infinite words is that of _ subword complexity_. the subword complexity function of a word @xmath10 is the function @xmath11 that counts the number of distinct subwords of length @xmath12 that appear in @xmath10 .",
    "avgustinovich , fon - der - flaass , and frid @xcite generalized the concept of subword complexity by considering the _ arithmetical complexity _ of a word .",

    "avgustinovich , fon - der - flaass , and frid showed that the words with lowest arithmetical complexity come from a class of words known as toeplitz words , of which the paperfolding words form a special class .",
