    "the experimental evidence of neutrino oscillations is one of the most important recent discoveries in particle physics .",

    "the existence of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos are massive particles and that the three flavor neutrinos @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are mixtures of neutrinos with definite masses @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations was studied in several atmospheric ( kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , soudan-2 @xcite , macro @xcite , minos @xcite , antares @xcite , icecube @xcite ) , solar ( homestake @xcite , gallex / gno @xcite , sage @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , borexino @xcite , kamland @xcite ) , reactor ( kamland @xcite , daya bay @xcite , double chooz @xcite , reno @xcite ) and accelerator ( k2k @xcite , minos @xcite , t2k @xcite ) experiments .",

    "now that we know that neutrinos are massive , one of the most fundamental open problems which must be investigated by experiments is the determination of the nature of neutrinos with definite mass : are they four - component dirac particles possessing a conserved lepton number @xmath11 or two - component truly neutral ( no electric charge and no lepton number ) majorana particles ?    neutrino oscillation experiments do not allow to answer this fundamental question , because in the neutrino oscillation transitions @xmath12 the total lepton number @xmath11 is conserved .",
    "therefore , neutrino oscillations do not depend on the majorana phases which enter in the neutrino mixing matrix if massive neutrinos are majorana particles @xcite .    in order to probe the nature of massive neutrinos we need to study processes in which the total lepton number @xmath11 is not conserved .",
    "the highest sensitivity to small majorana neutrino masses can be reached in experiments on the search of the @xmath11-violating neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay process @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a nucleus with atomic number @xmath15 and atomic mass @xmath16 .",

    ", if the standard model is a low - energy effective theory , the high - energy physics beyond the standard model can generate effective low - energy non - renormalizable lagrangian terms with products of fields with total energy dimension larger than four @xcite . since the effective lagrangian term of a dimension-@xmath28 field product with @xmath29 is suppressed by a coefficient @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the scale of new physics beyond the standard model , in practice only the terms with field products with small dimensionalities can be observable .",
    "it is remarkable that there is only one dimension-5 field product that can be constructed with standard model fields and this term violates the total lepton number @xmath11 .",
    "after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , this term generates small majorana neutrino masses and neutrino mixing .",
    "if this mechanism is realized in nature , the small majorana neutrino masses and neutrino mixing are the most accessible low - energy phenomena generated by the physics beyond the standard model .",

    "there is no @xmath22 decay .",
    "therefore , it is very important to search for @xmath11-violating processes as @xmath22 decay , which can reveal the majorana nature of massive neutrinos and open a window on the physics beyond the standard model .    the @xmath11-violating five - dimensional field product which generates small majorana",

    "tab : global ] ) the values of the neutrino oscillation parameters in the framework of three - neutrino mixing : the two solar and atmospheric mass differences , @xmath520 and @xmath521 , and the three mixing angles @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the experiments on the study of neutrino oscillations enter now a new stage of high - precision measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters , of determination of the neutrino mass ordering ( normal or inverted ) , and of measurement of the cp - violating phase @xmath47 , which is the last unknown parameter of the three - neutrino mixing matrix in the case of dirac neutrinos . if massive neutrinos are majorana particles , there are two additional `` majorana phases '' that are observable in processes which violate the total lepton number , as neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay .",
    "in fact , the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath33 in @xmath22 decay depends on the majorana phases , which can cause cancellations among the contributions of the three neutrino masses ( see section  [ bb6 ] ) . hence , even assuming a value for the absolute scale of neutrino masses , there are large uncertainties on the possible value of @xmath33 , which depend on the normal or inverted character of the neutrino mass spectrum ( see figs .",

    "now no @xmath22 decay has been observed , with the exception of the controversial claim in ref .   of observation of @xmath22 decay of @xmath23 , which is currently strongly disfavored by the direct lower limit on @xmath522 of the gerda experiment @xcite and indirectly by the lower limits on @xmath491 of the exo @xcite and kamland - zen @xcite experiments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xege ] ) .",
    "the current experimental upper bound on @xmath33 is between about 0.2 and 0.6 ev ( see tab .  [ tab : explim ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] ) , depending on the uncertainties in the theoretical calculations of the nuclear matrix elements which determine the rates of nuclear @xmath22 decays ( see section  [ bb4 ] ) .",
    "the problem of the calculation of the nuclear matrix elements ( see section  [ bb5 ] ) is open and so far unresolved .",
    "there are several methods of calculation whose results differ by a factor between about two and four for different nuclei ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : nme ] ) .",
    "it is clear that this situation is deeply unsatisfactory and it requires an effort of clarification of the nuclear physics community . a promising improvement could come from tests of the nuclear matrix elements with heavy - ion double charge - exchange reactions ( numen project@xcite ) which have a nuclear transition operator with the same spin - isospin mathematical structure of that of @xmath22 decay and proceed through the same excited levels of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "it is interesting that also the quenching of @xmath406 is expected to be similar , because both processes happen in the same nuclear medium .",
    "information on the nmes can be obtained also in charged - current neutrino - nucleus interactions @xcite .",
    "the next generation of @xmath22 decay experiments is aimed at the exploration of values of @xmath33 below 0.1 ev , with the purpose of reaching the inverted hierarchy interval between about 0.02 and 0.05 ev .",
    "this is a very important goal , which will allow either to discover @xmath22 decay or to exclude the inverted hierarchy .    in the first case",
    ", we will know that massive neutrinos are majorana particles and that there must be physics beyond the standard model which explains the small majorana masses ( see section  [ bb3 ] ) .",
    "however , it is not possible to know from the measurement of @xmath22 decay alone if the scheme of neutrino masses is inverted or normal and it may be difficult to do it also with independent measurements of the sum of the neutrino masses ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flm ] ) and of the effective electron neutrino mass in @xmath0 decay ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mbt ] ) .    on the other hand , in the second case",
    "the lack of observation of @xmath22 decay with @xmath523 will exclude the inverted hierarchy , leaving only the normal hierarchy as a viable possibility . in this case",
    ", the majorana nature of massive neutrinos will be still uncertain and it may be possible that the cancellations among the massive neutrino contributions make @xmath33 so small that it will be very difficult to measure it in a foreseeable future .",
    "let us however remark that the implications of these two possibilities for the scheme of the masses of the three light neutrinos would be radically changed if future experiments will confirm the current indications in favor of the existence of a sterile neutrino at the ev scale ( see refs .  ) .",
    "let us finally note that although in this review we considered only the neutrinoless double-@xmath524 decay process in eq .",
    "( [ bb0- ] ) , if the total lepton number @xmath11 is violated some nuclei can undergo the neutrinoless double-@xmath525 decay process @xmath526 which has the same expression ( [ totrate ] ) for the decay rate and can be used to measure the effective majorana mass @xmath24 .",
    "however there are only six nuclei with low natural isotopic abundances which can undergo @xmath527 ( @xmath528 ) and @xmath529 decays and the corresponding decay rates are suppressed by small phase space and unfavorable fermi function ( see ref .  ) .",
