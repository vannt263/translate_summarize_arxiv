    "more than half of the disk galaxies in the universe have central bars @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations show that bars form naturally in disk galaxies , and play a crucial role in their formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "there is now abundant evidence that our own galaxy is barred ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "one of the earliest indications came from the large non - circular motions of gas in the inner galaxy measured by @xcite and subsequently by @xcite .",
    "but it was not until the 1990s that the presence of a bar in the milky way ( mw ) was firmly established by the observations of a distinct peanut - shaped bulge in the cobe nir light distribution @xcite , a non - axisymmetric signature in the gas kinematics @xcite , ogle photometry showing a magnitude offset of the bulge red clump giants at positive and negative longitudes @xcite , and a large optical depth of the bulge to microlensing @xcite .",
    "all these observations agree that the bar is inclined at some orientation angle with respect to the sun - galactic center line with its the near end in the first galactic quadrant ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "nonaxisymmetric models of the inner galaxy have been produced in the last decade . @xcite and @xcite used cobe data to model the density distribution in the galactic bar .",
    "@xcite measured the properties of the bar using gas kinematics .",
    "@xcite used red clump giants to trace the mass distribution of the bar . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have taken initial steps towards building fully self - consistent stellar dynamical models based on the available density and kinematic data .",
    "existing stellar kinematic observation are insufficient to fully constrain the models , and there is significant variation in the estimates of the bar parameters such as orientation ( @xmath8 ) , co - rotation radius ( 3.5  5 kpc ) and pattern speed ( @xmath9 km s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "there is not yet a unified quantitative dynamical model of the galactic bar that explains all the observations in a consistent manner and the properties of the galactic bar are still poorly determined .",
    "+    the signature of the galactic bar should also be seen in the kinematic distortions of the stellar velocity field , since the orbits are no longer circular , but rather are elongated streams along the bar .",
    "the stellar kinematic evidence of bulge triaxiality is still ambiguous .",
    "there has been significant work done in the past on the line - of - sight velocities of m and k giants @xcite and proper motions @xcite in the bulge .",
    "but most of these radial velocity observations were limited to the low extinction baade s window ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite show that measurements in baade s window ( bw ) alone are insensitive to the effects of triaxiality , and a stronger kinematic signature of the bar will be apparent away from @xmath11 .",
    "the ideal observation would be to measure stellar velocity distributions with high s / n for several lines - of - sight ( los ) in the bar .",
    "a sample size of @xmath12 stars per los would enable the measurements of the higher moments of the velocity distribution and of the average radial velocity shift between the stellar streams in the bar @xcite .",
    "in addition , combining accurate proper motions with these los velocities would provide even stronger constraints on the current dynamical models of the galactic bar .",
    "further , the ratio of organized stellar streaming motion around the bar to random motion constrains the bar s angular rotation speed ( also called pattern speed ) @xcite .",
    "since bars can interact strongly with dark matter halos , transferring angular momentum into the halo and slowing the bar rotation dramatically @xcite , constraining the current pattern speed of the mw bar will provide a bound on the disk to halo mass ratio for the inner galaxy .",
    "the most recent bulge radial velocity survey by @xcite ( also see * ? ? ? * ) measured radial velocities at many positions along the major and minor axes of the bar , obtaining the rotation and velocity dispersion curves .",
    "these observations have addressed the crucial problem of measuring kinematics of the bar away from bw .",
    "however , their sample size along each los is limited to about 100 stars , insufficient to measure the higher moments of the individual velocity distributions or the kinematics of the stellar streams .",
    "our goal in the current investigation is to obtain a large radial velocity sample along several los , in order to measure these important quantities .    the basic procedure in fabry - prot ( fp ) imaging spectroscopy is to obtain a series of narrow - band images , tuning the interferometer over a range of wavelengths covering a spectral feature of interest .",
    "the data cube thus produced is analyzed to extract a short portion of the spectrum of each object in the field of view .",
    "this spectrum is fit to determine the strength , width and central wavelength of the spectral feature , and the level of the adjacent continuum .",
    "if there are many objects of interest within the field of view , the technique can be extremely efficient .",
    "fp spectroscopy has traditionally been used to measure emission features in extended objects , and has been highly successful for studying the velocity fields in disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) star forming regions @xcite , planetary nebula @xcite , and supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "it is less common to employ fp techniques to measure absorption spectra , but they have been used to determine the kinematics of stars in a large number of globular clusters @xcite , and the pattern speed of the bar in the early type galaxy ngc 7079 @xcite .",
    "and the central wavelength is 8543 .",
    "the increasing stellar density towards the southwest edge of the field is caused by the bulge globular cluster ngc 6522 .",
    "[ stellarfield ] ]    in the present paper we use fp absorption line spectroscopy to obtain radial velocities using the @xmath0  line for 2488 red clump giants ( rcgs ) , 339 red giants ( m / k type ) and 318 disk main sequence stars , towards three los in the mw bar : bw and two symmetric offset positions at @xmath13 ( see figure [ cobe ] ) .",
    "this sample is an order of magnitude larger than any previous sample for a given los .",
    "we also measure equivalent widths of the @xmath0  absorption lines that can be used to infer metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the late type stars",
    ". this will be the subject of a subsequent paper ( paper ii ) and is discussed only briefly here . in paper iii we will use our measurements for new , more detailed dynamical models of the mw bar .",

    "the triplet arises from the transition between the two levels of @xmath23 and the two levels of @xmath24 in .",
    "the temperature of the bulk of the ism is not high enough to excite to the @xmath23 state , and therefore no contamination from the foreground ism is expected .",
    "the 8542   line is the strongest of the triplet and falls in a wavelength region where the night sky is relatively free of strong terrestrial emission lines .",
    "we used a medium - resolution etalon with a spectral response function that is well fit by a voigt function with a fwhm of 4   , equivalent to approximately 140 km s@xmath3  at 8500   .",
    "we typically scanned a range of @xmath25   with wavelength steps of 1   .",
    "the fp images are not monochromatic , because the rays from off - axis points pass through the collimated beam at an angle , making the passband shift to the blue towards the edge of the field .",
    "the scanning range was sufficient to compensate for the 4  center - to - edge gradient by including extra images at the red end of the scan .",
    "the resulting spectra allowed measurement of the central wavelength of the line with high precision ( 5  10 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this project was plagued by bad weather and technical difficulties with the instrument and telescope , requiring a significantly longer period of time to acquire the data than expected . during two of the nights in the 1997",
    "run the instrument shutter malfunctioned , affecting the data for sub - fields mm5b - b and mm7b - b , which upon reduction showed large deviations in kinematics compared to the neighboring fields that overlap with them .",
    "for this reason we excluded these two fields from our analysis .",
    "because of time constraints only 18 images were obtained for the bw1-a field with heavy obscuration from clouds for half of them , and hence we also excluded this field .",
    "these exclusions brought the total sample size down to 3360 stars from seven sub - fields , of which 3144 are used in our kinematic analysis .",
    "we calibrated the wavelength response of the system with several lines around 8542  from a neon spectral lamp .",
    "the complete calibration sequence was done once per observing run , and was stable over the duration of the run ( and indeed from year to year ) .",
    "the precision of the wavelength calibration was typically better than @xmath26   , corresponding to 1.8 km s@xmath3at 8500   .",
    "the zero - point of the wavelength scale was affected by changes in the environmental conditions such as temperature and atmospheric pressure , and was monitored by taking a single neon calibration image once each hour during the observations . the wavelength zero - point for each observation image",
    "was determined by interpolation from these hourly calibrations . on images that have night sky lines within their spectral range , we can also use these sky lines to check the zero point .",
    "there were two weak oh lines ( at 8548.71    & 8538.67   ; @xcite ) that fall within our scanning range .",
    "although these lines had very low s / n , the zero - point we measured from them for a few frames was consistent with the interpolated calibration ring measurement .",
    "+      the images in each data cube are overscan corrected , trimmed and bias subtracted using iraf . to perform photometry on the individual images we use the daophot stand - alone package by @xcite that was specially developed to perform crowded field stellar photometry .",
    "the task find gives the initial centroids of all the stars in the field .",
    "after performing the initial aperture photometry using the phot task , psf - based photometry is performed using a quadratically variable psf , which we found to be especially useful at the edges of the field .",
    "we used about 50  100 stars per image to determine the psf .",
    "the allstar task then simultaneously fits all of the stars in the image using the measured psf to give a star subtracted image , and fluxes and positions for all stars . because daophot performs local sky subtraction , the fluxes are not affected by the presence of the weak oh sky lines .",
    "daophot includes the allframe @xcite program that is particularly useful for reducing a data cube .",
    "it simultaneously performs the psf fitting for all stars in all the images of the cube to derive positions and magnitudes in a self - consistent manner , making use of the geometric transformations between the individual images and photometry information for all images .",
    "because our fields are much less crowded than , for example , a globular cluster , daophot is able to resolve the stars easily .",
    "the final output of daophot are the centroids , fluxes ( in arbitrary units ) and flux uncertainty for each star .      in fp absorption line work",
    ", it is critically important to account for changes in flux due to variations in atmospheric transmission",
    ". this can be significant if the images of a spectral scan were taken over several nights or even in different years , or in non - photometric weather conditions . to measure the image - to - image normalization , we select about 30 high s / n stars uniformly covering the fov , so that there is a range in velocity and wavelength coverage .",
    "we assume that all of these stars have a single dominant absorption line that is well represented by a voigt function .",
    "we fit a voigt profile to the spectrum of each star , and at each point calculate the ratio of the fit to the observed flux . for each image in the scan , we then calculate the mean and standard deviation of these ratios , using all of the normalization stars for that image .",
    "this ratio is the normalization factor for that image .",
    "if an image was taken in average transparency conditions , then its normalization factor should be 1.0 , within the photometric uncertainty ; if the image had lower transparency , the normalization will be greater than unity .",
    "we correct the fluxes for each image in the scan using the individual normalization factors . in order to determine the final normalization factors",
    ", we re - fit the profile to the normalized data , and iterate the entire process until it converges .",
    "this procedure introduces an additional uncertainty in the flux measurement , which we call the ` normalization uncertainty ' .",
    "we combine this in quadrature with the daophot flux uncertainties . for the highest s / n ( @xmath27 ) stars the flux normalization error dominates , while for the majority of stars the daophot flux error is more important . since the different normalization stars have a range of velocities , and also because of the center - to - edge wavelength gradient in a fp image , an individual image samples the stars at several different points on the line profile ; this avoids  building in \" a particular profile shape through the normalization factors . under photometric conditions ,",
    "the normalization factors were typically @xmath28 , with uncertainties of @xmath29 . in bad conditions ,",
    "the worst normalizations were @xmath30 , with uncertainties of @xmath31 .",
    "we often re - observed at some of the wavelengths taken under poor conditions , and found excellent agreement between stellar fluxes after normalization .",
    "the @xmath0  absorption line profiles with the combined uncertainties are fit with a voigt function using the levenberg - marquardt method of least - squares fitting .",
    "the fit gives the central wavelength , continuum level , line strength , and the gaussian and lorentzian widths along with their measurement uncertainties .",
    "we find that the gaussian contribution to the shape of the absorption line is negligible for the majority of stars and the line could be fit equally well by fixing the gaussian width at @xmath32  , using essentially a lorentzian profile .",
    "this is because the instrumental profile itself is essentially lorentzian with a negligible gaussian core , and the @xmath0  line in these stars is strongly saturated with damping wings from collisional broadening .",
    "figure [ spec ] shows a sub - sample of absorption lines covering almost the entire brightness range for our sample from i - band magnitude of 10.0 to 16.5 .",
    "the voigt fit is represented by the solid line . for the brightest stars the velocity uncertainties can be as low as 2 km s@xmath3 and even for the very faint stars we can measure the absorption line adequately well with velocity uncertainties of 20  30 km s@xmath3 .",

    "the uncertainties are higher for fainter stars and also in cases where a star has a close or unresolved neighbor . in figure",
    "[ verr ] we show the distribution of velocity errors and the error as a function of s / n for the mm5b - c subfield .",
    "the major source of error in the radial velocity measurements comes from the uncertainties in the flux measurements , which include contributions from daophot and normalization errors . in the case of very high",
    "s / n stars in the best seeing sub - fields like mm5b - c and bwc - a ( with lower normalization errors ) the velocity errors can be as small as 2  5 km s@xmath3 .    to check",
    "if the velocity errors obtained from our voigt fitter are reasonable , we carried out monte carlo simulations of the data .",
    "for each star in our sample , we generated 1000 random realizations of its spectrum by perturbing the fluxes of each point of the voigt profile fit by the corresponding @xmath34 individual flux uncertainty .",
    "we then fit a voigt function to each of these generated spectra and find that the mean ratio of the error estimate from a single fit to the standard deviation of the velocities from the monte carlo fits is about 0.97 for all the fields , indicating that the single fit errors from our voigt fitter code are reliable .    for the bw los , there are nine bulge m / k - giant stars in our work that are also present in the radial velocity samples of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "mm5b - a and mm5b - c have identical kinematics and can be combined into a single field mm5b-(a+c ) .",
    "mm5b - d is at the same los and overlaps with the mm5b - c sub - field but has a mean velocity that is offset by 13 km s@xmath3  ( i.e. about a @xmath37 deviation ) .",
    "the dispersions in all three sub - fields however agree within the @xmath35 errors .",
    "for this reason we measure the velocity moments at @xmath62  using both mm5b-(a+c ) as well as the three sub - fields combined mm5b-(a+c+d ) .",
    "there are no significant differences in the kinematics of sub - fields mm7b - a , mm7b - c and mm7b - d , so they are combined into a single field mm7b-(a+c+d ) .",
    "the velocity distributions for mm5b-(a+c ) and mm7b-(a+c+d ) are shown in the left and right panel of figure [ vhist ] .",
    "the dotted line is the gauss - hermite fit with the @xmath58 and @xmath59 moments represented by the dashed and dot - dashed lines respectively .",
    "table [ kine ] lists the velocity moments along with their uncertainties .",
    "our large sample size allows us to measure @xmath60 and @xmath61 with high accuracy .",
    "as expected , in galactocentric coordinates @xmath60 has equal amplitude of about @xmath63 km s@xmath3  at @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath59 moment is significantly non - zero while the @xmath58 is consistent with zero .",
    "our high s / n velocity distributions show no sign of cold kinematic features that could be related to disrupted satellites , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "+    the analysis of the bw velocity distribution ( middle panel ) is slightly complicated by the presence of stars from the bulge globular cluster ngc 6522 , the outskirts of which extend into the southwest edge of our field ( see figure [ stellarfield ] ) .",
    "the spike at the center of the bw velocity distribution ( shown in figure [ vhist ] middle panel ) is caused by the stars that are part of this cluster . to extract kinematics",
    "we fit a double gaussian ( broad for the bulge and narrow for ngc 6522 ) to this distribution .",
    "the narrow gaussian has a mean velocity of @xmath64 km s@xmath3  and dispersion of @xmath65 km s@xmath3  ; consistent with previous measurements for ngc 6522 of @xmath66 km s@xmath3  and @xmath67 km s@xmath3 respectively @xcite .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ vhist ] shows the double gaussian fit to the distribution and the solid line is the broad component representing the bulge velocity distribution .",
    "we also fit a gauss - hermite series to this distribution and list the values in table [ kine ] , although this measurement is most probably affected by the presence of the spike at the center .",
    "since this is the most heavily studied los , there are several measurements of the kinematics in bw for comparison .",
    "our values of the mean line - of - sight velocity and dispersion are in excellent agreement with all previous measurements of the kinematics in bw such as @xcite ( @xmath68 km s@xmath3 , @xmath69 km s@xmath3 ) , @xcite ( @xmath70 km s@xmath3 , @xmath71 km s@xmath3 ) , @xcite ( @xmath72 km s@xmath3 , @xmath73 km s@xmath3 ) , @xcite ( @xmath74 km s@xmath3 , @xmath75 km s@xmath3 ) and @xcite ( @xmath76 km s@xmath3 , @xmath77 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "our measurements of the kinematics of m - giants ( in the heliocentric coordinate system ) are listed in table [ kine2 ] .",
    "we do not tabulate the measurements for bw since the globular cluster m - giants dominate the already small sample , and are difficult to separate from the bulge population , making the measurement unreliable . in figure [ comp ]",
    "we compare the kinematics of the bulge rcgs and m - giants from our sample with that of @xcite m - giants and @xcite ( zhao hereafter ) model .",
    "we find that the radial velocities of the rcgs and m - giants stars agree well with each other and with the @xcite measurements .",
    "however the los dispersion for our m - giant sample ( green diamonds ) is systematically lower than the rcgs ( red triangles ) , and is consistent with the velocity dispersion of @xcite m - giants ( black circles ) .",
    "note that the higher dispersion of the rcgs in our sample is not because they are fainter and thus have somewhat larger velocity uncertainties .",
    "the mle method we use removes the effects of the uncertainties from the estimate of the dispersion . in any event , to produce the difference between",
    "the m - giant and the rcg dispersion would require addition in quadrature of 40  50 km s@xmath3 compared to the uncertainties of 10  25 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the blue dashed line in figure [ comp ] is the prediction from zhao s model .",
    "the bar in this model rotates faster than the observed rotation curve at greater longitudes . according to zhao and @xcite this rapid rotation is due to a lack of retrograde orbits in the model . but adding retrograde orbits will increase the @xmath61 of the model , which may then agree with the dispersion of rcgs rather than that of the m - giants .",

    "our m - giant selection criteria are virtually the same as those of @xcite , who argue that contamination is negligible .",

    "earlier studies of the baade s window cmd @xcite found an excess of stars within 2.5 kpc of the sun .",
    "they associated this increased stellar density ( by a factor @xmath56 ) of dms stars with the location of the sagittarius spiral arm at a distance of @xmath56 kpc .",
    "the simulations performed by @xcite showed this density enhanced feature to consist of some very young stars ( 0.1  2.0 gyr ) that are identified with the recent spiral arm population superimposed on a larger population of young and intermediate age ( 2.0  7.0 gyr ) stars identified with some past spiral arm population .",
    "we find the @xmath61 to be the same ( @xmath91 45 km s@xmath3 ) towards all three los .",
    "according to the relationship between velocity dispersion and distance from the galactic center @xcite , our dispersion corresponds to a position within 3.5 kpc of the sun .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the stars in this feature may belong to the sagittarius spiral arm population .    ]",
    "the dispersion of the disk red clump feature ( magenta points on the cmd ) is about 53 km s@xmath3 , consistent with the disk kinematics .",
    "previous observations have established that the near end of the galactic bar is in the first galactic quadrant , i.e. , at positive longitudes . since the stars forming the bar stream in the same sense as the galactic rotation , for this bar orientation the stars on the near and far side of the bar will have radial velocity components towards and away from us , respectively .",
    "the radial velocity difference between these approaching and receding stellar streams depends on the orientation of the bar , among other things .",
    "since rcgs are good distance indicators with a small dispersion in intrinsic luminosity , they can be localized in space and used to measure precisely the velocity shift between the two streams ( @xcite ; mp02 hereafter ) .",
    "this measurement will provide an additional strong constraint on the dynamical models of the galactic bar , especially its orientation angle .",
    "+    mp02 discuss the optimal selection of the bright and faint samples to isolate these stellar streams .",
    "we adapt their criteria for the characteristics of our data set , selecting rcgs 0.2 to 0.6 magnitudes brighter and fainter than the peak in the observed luminosity distribution for each field to define the bright ( front side ) and faint ( back side ) , respectively .",
    "figure [ idist ] illustrates the two samples for the l = -5.0  field , and the details of these bright and faint samples for the three los are listed in table [ streamdata ] .",
    "figure [ stream ] shows the velocity distribution of the near and far side samples .",
    "we detect a clear velocity shift of @xmath92 km s@xmath3  in each of @xmath93  los . the velocity shift in bw",
    "is much smaller and is consistent with zero .",
    "this may be because in bw we are seeing an older spheroidal bulge population superimposed on the bar population , masking this signal .",
    "the higher velocity dispersion in bw also indicates that there are higher random motions compared to the streaming motions .",
    "our observed shifts of 35 km s@xmath3  are much greater than any possible projection effects arising from the galactic rotation and the location of the near and far samples ( 1  2 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this suggests that there are strong non - circular streaming motions associated with the bar .",
    "mp02 predicted the difference of the los component of the streaming motions between the bright and faint sample to be @xmath94 km s@xmath3 based on the e2 model of @xcite .",
    "this predicted shift is consistent with our measurements in the @xmath4  fields but not in bw .",
    "mp02 also discussed the effects of red giant contamination on these shifts and concluded that their presence in the rcg sample could significantly dilute the magnitude of the velocity shifts , so that the actual shifts could be larger than those that we measure .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) used sio masers in the bar to measure the velocity shifts .",
    "they find an average radial velocity difference of @xmath95 km s@xmath3  for sources with distances less than 7 kpc compared to those at distances greater than 7 kpc , essentially independent of longitude .",
    "while their results agree with our measurements , they suffer from a large ( 50% ) uncertainty in distance and large statistical errors in kinematics ( due to a smaller sample size ) .    as pointed out by @xcite most of the dynamical models of the inner galaxy",
    "do not predict or even discuss the change in average radial velocity with distance .",
    "the dynamical model of @xcite was one of the first to discuss this in some detail . in their figures",

    "we have a large enough sample of rcgs to plot los average velocity and dispersion as a function of distance in the inner galaxy , which we show in figure [ vimag ] .",

    "the mean equivalent width ( @xmath96 ) and its dispersion decrease on either side of bw similar to the los velocity dispersion .",
