    "ic 10 x1 , a luminous and variable x - ray binary in the dwarf irregular galaxy ic 10 , was discovered by @xcite using _",
    "rosat_. ic 10 is notable for being the closest starburst galaxy , at a distance of @xmath2  kpc @xcite , and for its marked overabundance of massive stars . in particular",
    ", there is a large population of wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars , despite ic 10 being extremely metal poor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "ic 10 x1  contains one such massive w - r star that closely orbits the compact x - ray source [ mac92 ] 17a @xcite , which we also refer to as ic 10 x1 . like a number of other x - ray binary systems ( e.g. , cyg x1 , @xcite ; lmc x1 , @xcite ; ss  433,@xcite , xte j1550564 , @xcite ; cyg x3 , @xcite ; grs  1915 + 105 and gro j165540 , @xcite ) , ic 10 x1  is embedded in a low - density bubble , @xmath3  pc across , and it is radio bright @xcite .",
    "the x - ray source exhibits a low - frequency 7  mhz quasi - periodic oscillation @xcite .",
    "based on the brightness of the source , in their discovery paper @xcite suggested ic 10 x1  as a likely black hole w - r binary .",
    "one intriguing outcome of the present census of stellar - black hole spin measurements is a possible dichotomy between the wind - fed ( `` x - ray persistent '' ) systems as compared to the roche - lobe overflow ( `` x - ray transient '' ) systems ( see @xcite ) : the transients have spins that range widely , from near - zero to near - maximal ; recent evidence suggests that much or all of the spin in these systems may have been supplied through long - acting accretion torques spinning up an initially non - rotating black hole @xcite . in contrast , the three known wind - fed systems ",
    "cyg x1 , lmc x1 , and m33 x7  harbor high - spin black holes ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the high spins of the wind - fed systems are especially noteworthy given the young ages of these systems , which precludes appreciable spin - up through accretion torques , implying that the spins of these black holes were imparted during the process of their formation .",
    "another distinction between the two classes of x - ray binaries is that the black holes in the wind - fed systems are significantly more massive . among the three established wind - fed systems , m33 x7 , which has a massive ( @xmath5 ) o - star companion @xcite , is similar to ic 10 x1  in that it is located in a low - metallicity local group galaxy at a distance of @xmath6  kpc and",
    "contains a quite massive @xmath7 black hole primary .",
    "firm dynamical estimates of the masses of two - dozen black holes ( bhs ) in x - ray binaries have been obtained , almost exclusively by measuring the doppler shifts of photospheric _ absorption _ lines .",
    "up until eight years ago , the distribution of masses was relatively narrow , @xmath8@xmath9 , a result that was upended by startling evidence , based on he ii _",
    "emission_-line velocities , that ic 10 x1  is comprised of a @xmath10 bh in a tight 35-hr orbit with a comparably massive @xmath11 w - r secondary @xcite . modeling the evolutionary history of this extraordinary system proved to be quite a challenge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , however , the mass estimate for ic 10 x-1 has been shown to be invalid : @xcite demonstrated that the he ii line does not originate from the star , but rather from a shadowed region in the wind of the w - r companion .",
    "they conclude that the mass of the primary is currently unknown and in @xcite that it may even be consistent with the mass of a neutron star .",
    "the spins of stellar - mass bhs are presently being measured using two x - ray spectroscopic techniques : continuum - fitting and reflection modeling .",
    "spin the bh s angular momentum , @xmath12 ; @xmath13 . ]",
    "is a quantity of great interest because according to the `` no - hair theorem '' spin and mass together uniquely and fully characterize a bh in general relativity .",
    "both methods rely upon a single foundational assumption , namely that the inner - disk terminates at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "observations establish the presence of a constant inner radius in bh systems in certain states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , theoretical studies have identified this constant radius with the isco ( e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite ) . in the x - ray continuum - fitting method ,",
    "one models the thermal emission from the multi - temperature accretion disk to constrain the size of the isco radius ; the method requires accurate measurements of the bh s mass @xmath14 , the system s inclination @xmath15 and distance @xmath16 . for the reflection method ,",
    "one models the relativistic distortion of fluorescent features from an accretion disk that is illuminated by a coronal source , with a focus on the @xmath17  kev fe k line .",
    "the extended red wing is a measure of the strength of the gravitational potential and allows one to estimate the disk s inner radius . to date ,",
    "application of these methods has yielded estimates of spin for a total of @xmath18 stellar bhs ( @xcite , and references therein ) ; additionally , the spins of a comparable number of supermassive bhs have been measured via reflection modeling ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given that the mass of the compact x - ray source is now unknown , we examine afresh the case of ic 10 x1 .",
    "we begin by considering the possibility that the x - ray source is a neutron star ( ns ) and show that this model is improbable .",
    "having concluded that ic 10 x1  contains a bh primary , we use the continuum - fitting method and an unrivaled spectrum obtained in simultaneous observations made using _",
    "chandra _  and _ nustar _ to place constraints on the spin of the bh .",
    "we carried out a joint observation using _ chandra _  and _ nustar _  for @xmath3  ks  just over one full orbit  starting on ut 2014 november 6 .",
    "_ chandra _  was operated using a single chip , acis i-3 , using a 100-row sub - array in order to minimize photon pileup , which causes distortion of the spectrum .",
    "this operating mode reduced the frame - time nearly tenfold , to just 0.4  s. because the maximum count rate in acis was merely  0.2 s@xmath19 ( corresponding to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath20  erg  s@xmath19 ) , the resulting degree of photon pileup is minimal , @xmath21 .",
    "the quite minor impact of the remaining pileup is nevertheless accounted for in all spectral fits , using the pileup model of @xcite . because the pileup was so modest",
    ", we could not fit for the model s grade migration term , and merely kept it fixed at a fiducial value of @xmath22 .",
    "this and other pileup settings had no impact on our fit results , but were incorporated for completeness in the analysis .",
    "_ chandra _  data have been reduced using ciao v4.7 . because the data were obtained near the chip edge , the response files are calibrated using an exposure map and aperture correction , which has modest ( @xmath21 ) impact on the effective area .",
    "our final spectrum employs a circular aperture with a 5  arcsec radius centered on ic 10 x1 , which was near the detector aim obpoint .",
    "the background is obtained using a blank region from the same observation .",
    "data have been binned to adequately oversample the detector resolution ( by a factor @xmath23 ) , and to a minimum of one count per bin .",
    "_ chandra _  spectra are fitted over 0.39  kev ( ic 10 x1  produces insignificant signal above this range for _ chandra _ ) , and _",
    "nustar _  from 330  kev% of the background level . ] .",
    "all data were standardized to the @xcite spectral standard model of the crab using the model crabcor following @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a shift in spectral slope of @xmath24 for _ chandra _  and a renormalization of @xmath25 . with _",
    "nustar _ , @xmath26 @xcite , and a floating cross - normalization term was fitted .",
    "we reduced the _",
    "data using the standard pipeline , nupipeline , part of the _ nustar _ data analysis software ( nustardas , v1.4.1 ) , with the latest instrumental calibration files ( caldb v20150316 ) .",
    "the unfiltered event files were cleaned with the standard depth correction , which significantly reduces the internal high - energy background , and passages through the south atlantic anomaly were removed .",
    "source spectra and instrumental responses were produced for each of the two focal plane modules ( fpma / b ) using nuproducts , extracted from a circular region of radius 50@xmath27 centered on ic 10 x1 .",
    "the background was estimated from a much larger region on the same detector as the source . in order to maximize the good exposure , in addition to the standard `` science '' ( mode 1 ) data",
    ", we also extracted the available `` spacecraft science '' ( mode 6 ) data .",
    "these are events collected while the source is still visible to the x - ray optics , but the star tracker located on the optics bench no longer gives a valid solution , so the aspect solution is constructed from the star trackers on the spacecraft bus instead .",
    "this typically results in some reduction in image reconstruction capabilities , but not in the spectral response of the instruments ( see walton et al . and",
    "fuerst et al .",
    ", in preparation , for more details ) . in this case , the source point - spread function ( psf ) degradation was very mild , and so the reduction of the mode 6 data simply followed the standard procedure outlined above , with a slightly larger source region of radius 55@xmath27 adopted to account for this slight degradation .",
    "these data provided an additional @xmath2830% exposure for this observation .",
    "finally , owing to the low signal - to - noise , we combined the data from fpma and fpmb using addascaspec .",
    "the resulting _ nustar _ spectrum provides a detection up to @xmath2830 kev .",
    "ic 10 x1  is in a fairly isolated field .",
    "the closest field source is @xmath29 from ic 10 x1 , and is only 1% as bright .",
    "meanwhile , the brightest source in the fov is @xmath30% as bright and is @xmath31 from ic 10 x1 .",
    "neither source was problematic for the _ nustar _",
    "we note , however , that the _ nustar _  data appear to imply surprisingly lower flux than _ chandra_. the data are fainter than would be expected by @xmath32 . in effort to understand this , we consider sources of calibration uncertainty in the _ nustar _  data . by comparing the _ nustar _",
    "point spread enclosed energy function of ic 10 x1  to that of the model used for correcting the psf in the _ nustar _  pipeline , we estimate that the actual count rate might be off by as much as 1015% .",
    "in addition , ic 10 x1  is located close to a detector edge , which at times sweeps through the psf .",
    "this is accounted for in the pipeline , but the correction is not accurate , particularly at low count rates . while difficult to precisely assess , a conservative 5 - 10% uncertainty is likely from this .",
    "finally , we note that the _ nustar _",
    "flux can be off globally by @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in total , the net error on _ nustar _  fluxes may be up to @xmath34 .",
    "spectral analysis was conducted using xspec v.12.9.0c @xcite , and model optimization employed xspec s c - statistic ( `` @xmath35 '' ) @xcite , as appropriate for poisson - distributed data , which is analogous to the familiar @xmath36 statistic . ] .",
    "the _ chandra _  and _ nustar _",
    "light curves from our observation are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the strong dip marks the passage of the x - ray primary source behind a thick , wind - obscured core of the w - r star , marked by energy - dependent scattering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we select in- and out - of eclipse regions ( `` low '' and `` high '' , respectively ) .",
    "the high - flux region is split into two segments ( `` high-1 '' and `` high-2 '' ) , to check for possible phase variation as the source passes through the strong wind of the companion .",
    "the broadband x - ray flux in eclipse is just @xmath2812% of the flux out of eclipse . given the presence of a powerful w - r wind in which the source is embedded , the origin of this emission is likely to be electron scattering of x - rays from the photoionized wind of the w - r star and we adopt this scenario in using a corresponding model for which this signal is attributed to the inner - region s x - ray emission scattering off of an extended `` halo '' of electrons in the wind .",
    "a schematic of this system is shown in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "as pointed out , e.g. , by @xcite , this is no true `` eclipse '' in the sense of a solid body obscuring another , but rather must be attributed to a compton - thick scattering agent , which is sensibly depicted by @xcite as a thick shell of wind surrounding the star .",
    "this picture is similarly compatible with the parallel system ngc 300 x1 , a 33  hr orbit wr - bh binary @xcite .",
    "we therefore additionally allow for highly absorbed emission from the primary source passing through such a compton thick wind ( the scattered contribution is present in both the low and high phases ) ; for the first time , the high - energy coverage provided by _ nustar",
    "_  allows for the detection of the transmitted photons at high energies which are insensitive to the veiling of the large gas column ( as well as the compton component ) .",
    "ideally , this model would allow for the absorption to vary with phase over the full duration of the eclipse .",
    "however , given the faintness of the source to both instruments , we make a simplification and require a single , _",
    "characteristic _ column of absorber to capture this effect in the `` low '' observation .",
    "we note , however , that given sufficient signal in conjunction with a more complete model of the w - r companion and an expected wind profile , one could place a firm constraint on the inclination using the phase evolution of the column .",
    "our data is not of this quality , and such an investigation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a strong and broad absorption signature is detected with _",
    "chandra _  near @xmath37 . the most obvious origin for such a feature is absorption in the powerful ionized winds .",
    "we delve into the absorption features further in section  [ subsec : bhspin ] . to model this appropriately ,",
    "we have employed the photoionization code xstar @xcite assuming the gas is hydrogen depleted ( for practical reasons , we ran the code using a hydrogen abundance of 0.1 solar ) , and metal poor ( each metal set to 0.15 solar abundance ) , with a solar setting for he .",
    "we employed as an input spectrum , the average spectrum corresponding to the out - of - eclipse model , with neutral absorption removed .",
    "we computed a table of warm absorbers corresponding to a range of columns and ionizations widely bracketing our system , spanning a range in column density of @xmath38  @xmath39 and of log @xmath40 .",
    "( we assume a covering fraction of unity for the warm absorber . )",
    "this gas is ascribed a turbulent velocity ( free in the fit ) using a gaussian smearing kernel in the same manner as @xcite . here ,",
    "such blurring is ad - hoc ; it may , for instance , be indicative of a mixture of ionizations given the multi - phased ionization structures present in the wind ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the warm absorber s ionization is fitted for and tied across phases , but the gas column is allowed to vary between `` low '' and each of the `` high '' phases . because the 2  kev feature was not completely removed using this model , we also included a gaussian absorption line that significantly improved the spectral fit ( @xmath41 ) , and produced relatively minor influence on the other fit parameters .",
    "% of an orbital cycle , is a consequence of the dense and powerful stellar winds emanating from the w - r companion . in the lower - panel ,",
    "the _ chandra _  curve is overlaid for reference , having been simply rescaled ( red dashed ) .",
    "a running fit to the _ nustar _",
    "data is in blue .",
    "note that the eclipse appears both shallower and also somewhat narrower in _ nustar _  compared to _",
    "this is a direct result of _ nustar _",
    "s sensitivity to higher energies , which are less affected by absorption in the wind .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ]",
    "we first consider models in which the compact primary of ic 10 x1  is an accreting neutron star with its spectrum dominated by a thermal component of radiation from the star s photosphere .",
    "we show that the model implies stellar radii that are much greater than those observed for luminous accreting neutron stars , and we therefore discard this model and consider the one viable alternative , namely , that the compact object is a black hole . using the continuum - fitting method , while considering liberal ranges for the mass of the black hole and disk inclination , we show that the black hole is spinning rapidly .",
    "accreting ns systems in low - mass x - ray binaries fall into two categories : `` z '' and `` atoll '' , the names of which refer to the characteristic shape traced out by each in an x - ray hardness  intensity diagram . between the two classes ,",
    "z - sources are the most luminous , generally emitting near , even above , the eddington limit ( @xmath42 and upwards ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed ( isotropic - equivalent ) source luminosity in the _ chandra _ band is @xmath43  erg  s@xmath19 ( 0.510 kev ) , or @xmath44% of the eddington luminosity ( adopting @xmath45  erg  s@xmath19 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "this luminosity is squarely in the range observed for z sources .",
    "that the spectrum of ic 10 x1  is predominately thermal is indicated by the much lower luminosity observed by _ nustar _  above 10 kev , which is @xmath47% of the luminosity in the full _ chandra _  band .",
    "meanwhile , the difference between the observed luminosity and the intrinsic source luminosity due to scattering in the stellar wind ( section  [ section : wind ] ) is @xmath48% and unimportant for the discussion at hand .",
    "additional evidence that the spectrum is thermal is provided by results presented in this section ; namely , in fitting the spectrum with thermal models , we find that the power - law component is exceptionally faint and can be accounted for by upscattering of at most only a few percent of the seed photons .    before presenting our analysis of the spectrum of ic 10 x1",
    ", we discuss pertinent results for accreting neutron stars with a focus on estimates of their radii .",
    "the key neutron star binary for our discussion is xte j1701462 .",
    "this remarkable source traced out the full - repertoire of z source states and then transitioned through a lower - luminosity atoll phase @xcite . in studying the evolution of the source , @xcite ( hereafter l09 ) employed a model comprised of three spectral components : ( i ) a single - temperature blackbody from the stellar surface , which describes emission from the boundary layer ( sometimes called a `` spreading '' layer ) ; ( ii ) a cooler multi - temperature blackbody from an accretion disk ; and ( iii ) a power - law component due to compton up - scattering .",
    "we note that the model of the boundary layer region is relatively uncertain .",
    "it is frequently assumed to be optically thick and of modest height , of order @xmath49  km , ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the boundary layer has been modeled as a hot , low - density gas that at high luminosities can extend both radially and out of the disk plane by more than 1 stellar radius , in which case it would behave like a scattering atmosphere ( akin to a corona ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the theoretical uncertainties in the size of the boundary layer , we turn to empirical evidence that shows it is compact . for our touchstone source xte j1701462 ,",
    "during its evolution as a z source its power - law component was generally negligible and its blackbody radius was in the range @xmath50  km over the luminosity range @xmath51 . in evolving through the fainter atoll phase in soft states , the blackbody radius remained constant at 1.7  km . in every observation throughout the outburst ,",
    "the radius was strictly @xmath52  km ; such estimates are firm because the distance estimate for xte j1701462 is based on super - eddington type i bursts @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , small radii are widely reported in studies of other luminous accreting nss .",
    "for the z source gx 17 + 2 , @xcite found that across all states the blackbody radius was @xmath52  km . in a study of six canonical z sources ,",
    "@xcite found blackbody radii that are consistently @xmath48  km ( apart from the unstable `` flaring branch '' for which the maximum radius observed was 16  km ) . while z sources are most appropriate for comparison with ic 10 x1 , we note that radius estimates reported for the less luminous atoll sources are typically @xmath53  km ( @xcite , and references therein ) and are strictly @xmath54  km in the works cited . _ the small blackbody radii inferred for xte j1701462 and other nss constitutes the strongest empirical evidence for a compact ns boundary layer .",
    "_    we now present the results of our analysis of the data for ic 10 x1  with a focus on the blackbody radius of its hypothetical neutron star .",
    "our analysis follows closely the lead of l09 .",
    "our spectral model allows for the modest effects due to the presence of the phase - dependent warm absorber described in section  [ section : wind ] and to scattered light , using the in - eclipse spectrum to calibrate the magnitude of its contribution .",
    "we consider two basic models : model 1 is a single - temperature blackbody ; model 2 is this same blackbody component plus an accretion disk component ( modeled via ezdiskbb ; @xcite ) .    for both models , we : ( 1 ) model compton scattering of thermal photons in a corona using simpl @xcite",
    ". the photon spectral index is poorly determined , and so we fix @xmath55 , a choice that is in this case inconsequential for the determination of the blackbody radius .",
    "( 2 ) we include neutral absorption using tbabs ( with wilm abundances ; @xcite , and vern cross - sections ; @xcite ) .",
    "( 3 ) initially , we model the @xmath53  kev absorption feature ( section  [ section : wind ] ) with a gaussian .",
    "this component turns out to be significant only for model 1 , and so we omit it in our final analysis for model 2 .    results for the two models are summarized in table  [ tab : ns ] .",
    "the data are well - fitted by both models 1 and 2 with @xmath56 and 0.96 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned above , the compton component is faint , as measured by the parameter @xmath57 in table  [ tab : ns ] ; only a few percent of the thermal photons are scattered into the power law .",
    "the key results at the bottom of the table are the @xmath58 lower bounds on the blackbody radius , which were obtained using xspec s error search command .",
    "_ we establish a lower limit on the size of the hypothetical neutron star in ic 10 x1 , including its boundary layer , of @xmath59  km at 99.7% confidence , which is much greater than the directly - comparable value of @xmath60  km for luminous neutron stars discussed above .",
    "_ we therefore reject a neutron star model for ic 10 x1 .",
    "not only does the empirical comparison of its radius against hundreds of spectra of known ns systems rule against identifying ic 10 x1  as a ns , but so too does interpretation of the radius in the context of ns models .",
    "we first note that emission from a neutron star s surface is physically subject to a color correction @xmath61 ( a scale factor relating color temperature to effective temperature that accounts for a hot scattering atmosphere ) , where @xmath62 @xcite , and the emission is likewise subject to corrections that account for relativistic distortion of the emitting area ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both effects serve to adjust the size of the emitter _ upwards _ , in the sense that the true size would be strictly larger than implied when such effects are ignored .",
    "similarly , any obscuration by the disk would likewise serve to increase the true size of the emitter when compared to the blackbody fit result .",
    "therefore , the size returned by the simple and non - relativistic blackbody model , which neglects these corrections , is already guaranteed to underestimate the true size .",
    "this is important given that the lower limit on the boundary layer size of 32.5  km is already large compared to the maximum ns size ( @xmath63 km , e.g. , @xcite ) .    finally , we consider the physical he - atmosphere model nsx of @xcite , which includes the effects of spectral hardening and relativistic distortion",
    ". replacing directly the blackbody component with this model component and repeating our analysis , we obtain the results for models 1a and 2a , which are given in the rightmost columns of table  [ tab : ns ] . for the nsx model , our lower limit on the radius is @xmath64  km at 99.7% confidence , which is far greater than predicted by any theoretical model of a neutron star .    in summary , using a simplistic blackbody component to describe the boundary layer emission , we have established a hard lower limit on the emitting surface area which is still a factor @xmath65 larger than has been observed for any accreting neutron star in , respectively , flaring or stable states .",
    "we are therefore forced to conclude that either ic 10 x1  has unique properties among the nss which cause it to appear so large , or else it is a bh .",
    "while we can not definitively rule out the possibility that ic 10 x1  is an exotic ns , parsimony via occam s razor supports its identification as a bh .",
    "therefore , we rule against the possibility of a neutron star primary , and with the black - hole nature of ic 10 x1  prevailing , now change focus to black hole spectral models .",

    "unfortunately , none of the spectra , apart from the november 2014 observation , can deliver an independent and reliable estimate of spin primarily because of the limited bandwidth , which does not allow one to isolate the thermal component from the compton component .",

    "the duration of the x - ray eclipse , including the effects of the o - star s extended wind ( @xmath191  yr@xmath19 ) , is 0.15 in phase , with the full width and speed of ingress strongly influenced by the absorption and scattering of x - rays in the wind .    as was explored for m33 x7 @xcite , and as considered for ic 10 x1  by @xcite , we compute the bondi - holye - littleton ( bhl ) rate of mass capture by ic 10 x1  in order to check its compatibility with the mass supply and efficiency of the bh ( @xmath192  g  s@xmath19 from our fits over the allowed range of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in figure  [ fig : contour ] ) . from @xcite , for a supersonic wind",

    "@xcite we estimate roughly @xmath201  km  s@xmath19 , which includes the moderate effect of orbital motion ( appropriate for the range of typical bh masses ) . using the mass - loss rate from @xcite of @xmath202 , the predicted electron and mass densities in the helium - dominated wind are @xmath203 , and @xmath204  g  @xmath205 . for the range of bh masses in question",
    "@xmath206 , @xmath207 comes out in the range @xmath208  g  s@xmath19 , with larger values corresponding to solutions for higher bh masses .",
    "although the estimate is crude , it demonstrates that mass capture and subsequent accretion from the w - r wind is fully capable of powering the bh .",
    "we can check on the above prediction for the wind profile by noting that the change in the line - of - sight column of the warm absorber , while weakly constrained , grows over the orbit by , very roughly @xmath209  @xmath39 ( noting that as determined from the mcmc analysis , the increase is at a mere 2@xmath210 significance ) , being largest when eclipsed . because the source has reached a pathlength greater by @xmath211 , the density in the wind is @xmath212 .",
    "when accounting for the abundance differences between ic 10 and the galaxy , the absence of h in the w - r star , again the dearth of metals wash out to a correction factor of roughly unity .",
    "this bolsters the above picture for mass - loss in the system and underscores the assumed association between warm absorber and the w - r wind .",
    "finally , we observe that a simple estimate for the ionization pattern far from the bh at high latitudes is that the ionization parameter @xmath213 should be of order thousands , and that given sufficient resolution one would expect to find a dark cone with a factor @xmath185 lower ionization in the shadow of the star . in practice ,",
    "the constraints on the ionization parameter from the observations are weak , and so we can only say that our results are not in conflict with this value .",
    "in summary , using a _ chandra_/_nustar _  observation we have demonstrated that the compact primary in ic 10 x1  is implausible as a neutron star and therefore a black hole explanation is highly likely .",
    "although the mass is uncertain , for any pairing of black hole mass @xmath14 and inclination @xmath15 we have determined a unique and precise estimate of the spin parameter @xmath107 using the continuum - fitting method .",
    "the strongly disk - dominated spectrum of ic 10 x1  makes this method an especially reliable one .",
    "meantime , this distant source ( @xmath214  kpc ) is presently too faint for application of the fe - line method .",
    "_ nustar s _ high - energy coverage picks up precisely where _",
    "chandra s _ effective area is falling .",
    "critically , the mutual capabilities of _ chandra _  and _ nustar _  allow one to firmly anchor the power - law component and thereby isolate and reliably model the thermal component .    our excellent data set allows us to obtain a net precision of @xmath215 .",
    "however , we are hampered by a serious limitation , namely the uncertain mass of the black hole .",
    "we meet this challenge by computing the spin as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 over a broad range of these parameters ; our constraints on @xmath107 are displayed in figure  [ fig : contour ] .",
    "we find that if the mass is comparable to that in the other wind - fed systems ( a value significantly above the typical mass of a transient black hole ) then the spin of ic 10 x1  is likely be high ( @xmath216 ) , as it is for the other wind - fed systems .",
    "the massive w - r companion implies a young age for ic 10 x1 , which in turn implies that the high spin was imparted to the black hole during its birth event .",
    "it is important now to attempt to estimate the mass of the black hole because the combination of high - mass and high - spin would strengthen the apparent dichotomy between wind - fed and transient black hole x - ray binaries ( section 1 ) , which would point to a distinct formation channel for bh systems with massive companions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "presently , while we can rule against a neutron - star primary , the jury is still out on the mass  and hence the spin  of the bh in ic 10 x1 .",
    "if in future work the mass of the bh can be constrained , then our results provide an immediate complementary estimate of its spin .    this research has made use of software provided by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
