    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars consisting of white dwarfs accreting from low - mass , roche lobe filling companions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "angular momentum is continuously lost from the binary orbit , driving mass transfer , as well as evolution in orbital period ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "there are still many uncertainties in the theoretical description of cv formation and evolution ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as several serious discrepancies between the predictions of theory and the properties of the observed cv population ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; pretorius & knigge 2008a , b ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to constrain evolution models , more and better observational constraints on the properties of the galactic cv population are needed .",
    "a fundamental parameter predicted by cv evolution theory , that is expected to be more easily measured than most properties of the intrinsic cv population , is the space density , @xmath0 . the luminosity function ( @xmath1 )",
    "is a closely related property ; although more challenging to constrain than @xmath0 , @xmath1 contains information on the mass transfer rate ( @xmath11 ) distribution of cvs and is therefore potentially much more valuable than the space density alone .",
    "some theoretically predicted values of the cv space density are @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "observational estimates are typically lower , but have a large range ; values from @xmath15 to @xmath16 have been reported ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "fewer estimates of the cv luminosity function are available , but x - ray ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and hard x - ray @xcite luminosity functions have been published ( see also @xcite for near - ir and optical luminosity functions ) .",
    "the work of @xcite is based on the sample of non - magnetic cvs with parallax distances less than 200  pc ; although this sample is certainly not complete , it gives a firm lower limit on the luminosity function .",
    "the cv samples used by @xcite and @xcite consist mostly of magnetic cvs .",
    "uncertainty in @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) measurements is in part caused by statistical errors , arising from uncertain distances and small number statistics .",
    "however , the dominant source of uncertainty , as well as the cause of inconsistencies between some estimates , is most likely systematic errors caused by selection effects .",
    "the selection effects acting on cv samples are most easily accounted for in samples with simple , well - defined selection criteria .",
    "whereas optical cv samples always include selection criteria based on , e.g. , colour , variability , or emission lines , there are x - ray selected cv samples that are purely flux - limited .",
    "the completeness of these samples is easier to model than that of any existing optically selected sample .",
    "furthermore , there is a well - known empirical correlation between the ratio of optical to x - ray flux ( @xmath17 ) and optical luminosity , implying that an x - ray flux limit does not introduce as strong a bias against intrinsically faint , short - period cvs as an optical flux limit ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the _ rosat _ bright survey ( rbs ) consists of all bright ( count rate @xmath18 ) , high galactic latitude ( @xmath19 ) sources in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "optical counterparts have been identified for all sources in the rbs @xcite , and it includes 46 cvs ( of which 11 were previously unknown ; see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite already used this survey to estimate @xmath20 for non - magnetic cvs ; they note that this measurement is dominated by two systems with very small distance estimates , and would be an over - estimate if these two distances where significantly under - estimated ( as has turned out to be the case ; @xcite ) . omitting those two sources , @xcite",
    "obtain @xmath21 .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have considered non - magnetic cvs from the _ rosat _ north ecliptic pole ( nep ) survey ; this survey is 2 orders of magnitude deeper than the rbs , but covers a much smaller area ( @xmath2281  sq.deg .",
    ", down to roughly @xmath23 ; see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and also has complete optical follow - up .",
    "the rbs and nep survey thus complement each other in terms of depth and angle .",
    "here we combine these 2 surveys to provide new observational constraints on the space density , as well as the x - ray luminosity function of non - magnetic cvs .",
    "the combined survey is still purely x - ray flux limited ( although the flux limit is variable over the survey area ) , and yields a sample of 20 non - magnetic cvs . in a future paper",
    "we will consider magnetic cvs detected in the rbs .",
    "we describe the non - magnetic cv sample in section  [ sec : sample ] , where we also present distance and @xmath24 estimates for these 20 systems . in section  [ sec : rho ] we describe the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and in sections  [ sec : results ] and [ sec : fluxl ] we present the results .",
    "finally , the results are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] and the conclusions listed in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the rbs covers half the sky down to a flux limit of @xmath25 ( assuming a 10  kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ) , and includes 16 non - magnetic cvs . with the same assumed spectrum ,",
    "the nep flux limit varies from roughly @xmath26 to @xmath27 over the 81  sq.deg . survey area .",
    "only 4 cvs where detected in the nep , all of them non - magnetic ( rx j1715 , sdss j1730 , rx j1831 , and ex dra ) . the 2 surveys have no cvs in common , although they overlap slightly  none of the rbs systems are in the area covered by the nep survey , and the nep cvs are all fainter than the rbs flux limit .    the complete sample of 20 non - magnetic cvs is presented in table  [ tab : distances ] .",
    "the rbs sample differs from that used by @xcite in that we include tw pic and exclude ei uma .",
    "tw pic was at first thought to be an intermediate polar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but more recently @xcite has argued convincingly that the data favour a non - magnetic nature .",
    "ei uma , on the other hand , has now been shown to be magnetic ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that none of the systems in our sample are period bouncers ( cvs that have evolved through the observed minimum @xmath10 near 80  min , and that are now evolving towards longer @xmath10 ; e.g.  @xcite ) . in the case of the long - period cvs , tt ari , ef tuc , rx j1831.7 + 6511 , ww cet , v405 peg , and ex dra , this needs no justification .",
    "eight of the short - period systems ( sw uma , t leo , bz uma , vw hyi , wx hyi , su uma , sdss j173008.38 + 624754.7 , and ty psa ) have mass ratios implying that they are not period bouncers ( as indicated by fractional superhump period excess ; see @xcite ; @xcite ) . for cc",
    "scl , rx j1715.6 + 6856 , iq eri , rbs490 , tw pic , and rbs1411 there is no information on mass ratio ( in fact , the orbital periods of several of these systems are not known ) , and the simplest assumption is that they are normal , pre - period bounce cvs .      in order to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we need distance estimates for all cvs in the sample . although good distance measurements are available for some of these systems , in many cases the distance estimates that we can derive are quite imprecise .",
    "t leo , bz uma , rbs490 , sw uma , and v405 peg have high - quality parallax distance measurements ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other reliable estimates of cv distances are found by photometric parallax , in cases where the white dwarf or the donor star is detected in a way that makes it possible to disentangle its flux contribution from that of other light sources .",
    "we use such estimates for tt ari and ex dra .",
    "tt ari has a distance measurement based on the donor star spectrum ( @xcite ; this is also consistent with the distance derived from the white dwarf spectrum ) .",
    "based on the photometric parallax of the secondary , the distance to ex dra is @xmath28 ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; we have revised this to be slightly less conservative than the estimate we used previously ) .",
    "there are a few well - known , less direct ( and less reliable ) methods of estimating distances to cvs .",
    "we use methods based on dwarf nova ( dn ) outburst maximum ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) , the near - ir apparent brightness for systems in which the donor star is not directly detected ( the method of @xcite , but as prescribed by @xcite and @xcite ) , and the strength of h@xmath29 emission lines ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between the absolute magnitude at dn outburst maximum and @xmath10 was most recently studied by @xcite , who confirms that the scatter is relatively small , and that there are no large outliers .",
    "we therefore use this relation as far as possible ( for cc scl , vw hyi , wx hyi , su uma , ty psa , ww cet , sdss j1730 , and ef tuc ) .",
    "it should be noted that su uma has a parallax distance estimate that agrees very well with the distance based on outburst maximum , but which is less precise ; we choose in this case to use the estimate based on outburst , rather than the parallax ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "two systems , sdss j1730 and ef tuc , do not have orbital inclination measurements ( although it is known that they are not eclipsing ) , and have less well determined maximum apparent magnitudes , leading to more imprecise distance estimates from this method .    for rx j1831 we use the prescription of @xcite ( as updated by @xcite ) .",
    "this is based on a semi - empirical donor sequence for cvs , and the offsets between this sequence and the absolute @xmath30 magnitudes of a sample of cvs with parallax distances .",
    "apparent near - ir magnitudes for rx j1831 were obtained from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , although there clearly exists an empirical relation between @xmath31 and the absolute magnitude of the disc , this relation contains large scatter ( see @xcite for an updated plot ) .",
    "we therefore use it as a last resort , in those four cases where the data required by the other two methods are not available ( tw pic , iq eri , rx j1715 , and rbs1411 ) . for rx j1715 and rbs1411 , we have no data to allow us to check whether the absolute magnitudes we find are reasonable ( other than that rx j1715 is known to be a short - period cv , and that rbs1411 has an optical spectrum resembling that of a short - period cv ) . for the remaining 2 systems , we find absolute magnitudes that are in reasonable agreement with what we would find from outburst ( in the case of iq eri ) , and the method of knigge ( in the case of tw pic ) , if we made reasonable assumptions about orbital period .",
    "tw pic has spectroscopic and photometric periods near 2 and 6 hours ( the orbital period was initially assumed to correspond to the 6-h signal ; @xcite discuss the alternative interpretation of the more stable 2-h period being the orbital period ) . assuming the period near 2 hours is @xmath10 , the @xcite sequence would give a distance in agreement with what we find from @xmath31 .",
    "however , if the orbital period is as long as 6  h , the observed @xmath32 would imply an improbably bright absolute @xmath33 magnitude ( @xmath34 ; although note that at such long @xmath10 , the system would probably have an evolved donor , for which the donor sequence is not appropriate ) . ] .",
    "interstellar extinction is expected to be low for our systems , since they are at high galactic latitude , and since most of them are quite nearby . for those systems with distances below 200 pc , we neglect interstellar extinction . for the more distant objects , we use @xmath35 estimates from @xcite , where available , and for a few more",
    ", we find estimates in @xcite . in the cases where no more direct estimate of extinction is available",
    ", we use the model of @xcite , with a few iterations , so that the value we finally adopt in the distance calculation is that given by the model at the estimated distance to the object . to convert from visual extinction to extinction in the 2mass bands , we use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we conservatively assume errors of 50% in the extinction values .",
    "we then find the probability distribution for the distance to each source , assuming gaussian errors in all the input parameters ( apparent magnitudes , inclination , @xmath31 , extinction ) .",
    "the distances estimates , listed in column 3 of table  [ tab : distances ] , are in all cases the median , together with the 1-@xmath39 confidence interval corresponding to the 16th and 84th percentile points .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      most non - magnetic cvs have x - ray emission that can be described as thermal bremsstrahlung from the boundary layer ( the inner part of the disc where the flow is no longer keplerian , but is slowing down to match the rotation of the white dwarf ; @xcite , but see also e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum should then be the sum of emission from material with temperatures ranging from the temperature of the shock at the outer edge of the boundary layer to the temperature of the white dwarf photosphere ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations of many systems can be fit by a single temperature thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with @xmath40 between roughly 5 and 20  kev ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in other cases , multi - temperature ( or cooling flow )",
    "models are needed to provide satisfactory fits to observations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "high-@xmath11 systems ( nova - like cvs in a high state and dne in outburst ) are expected to have optically thick boundary layers , and therefore much softer spectra ; however , part of the boundary layer remains optically thin so that the soft component does not dominate the spectrum above @xmath41  kev ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assume a @xmath42 thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum for all cvs in our sample , and quote x - ray fluxes and luminosities in the 0.52.0  kev band .",
    "although there is no good physical justification for this simple approach , it is acceptable for our purposes , because the energy band we are using is narrow ( decreasing the sensitivity of @xmath24 to the assumed spectrum ) , and because our distances are for the most part quite imprecise ( implying that error arising from the assumed spectral shape is unlikely to contribute significantly to the total error in @xmath24 ; see below ) .",
    "we use the dust to gas ratio of @xcite to convert the @xmath35 estimates to @xmath43 for each system .",
    "the @xmath43 estimates are low ( the highest being @xmath44 , for sdss j1730 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we list unabsorbed @xmath45 and @xmath24 in table  [ tab : distances ] .    in order to provided further justification for our assumptions regarding the x - ray spectrum , we can consider the error in @xmath24 using standard error propagation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the error in distance ( in the best cases about 15% , but larger for most systems ) , @xmath48 is the observational error ( typically @xmath2210% ) , and @xmath49 is the error caused by uncertainty in @xmath43 , and by an incorrect assumption of x - ray spectrum . in order for @xmath49 to dominate @xmath50 , we must have @xmath51 .",
    "this seems unlikely , because in the narrow energy band ( 0.52.0  kev ) , for moderate @xmath43 and allowing for a 50% error in @xmath43 , the difference in @xmath45 between single - temperature bremsstrahlung spectra with @xmath52 and @xmath53 is only @xmath54 .",
    "high-@xmath11 cvs are naturally expected to have brighter @xmath24 ; therefore , @xmath24 should increase with @xmath10 .",
    "this is certainly not apparent in the luminosities we find ( see the @xmath10 and @xmath24 values in table  [ tab : distances ] ) .",
    "@xcite show that , for low-@xmath11 systems , @xmath24 indeed increases with @xmath11 , but that at roughly @xmath55 the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath11 flattens off .",
    "binary inclination may also be expected to add noise to this relation .",
    "@xcite find only a weak correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath10 , while @xcite find none .",
    "given the large scatter or weakness of any correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath10 , @xmath24 is not a good indicator of period ( or , by implication , age ) ; in the calculations described in section  [ sec : simphi ] , @xmath24 is therefore the only physical parameter of the simulated cvs .",
    "here we describe the calculation of the space density and x - ray luminosity function from the sample of 20 non - magnetic cvs detected in the combined rbs and nep survey .",
    "the results of this calculation are presented in the next section .",
    "the most important assumption of the method we use is that the observed cv sample is representative of the underlying population . whether this is a reasonable assumption",
    "is addressed further in section  [ sec : fluxl ] and [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the number of cvs per unit volume is of course a function of position in the galaxy .",
    "we ignore the ( weak ) radial dependence of @xmath0 , and assume that the vertical density profile is exponential @xmath56 with @xmath57 the distance from the galactic plane ( i.e. @xmath58 ) .",
    "the local space density is defined as @xmath59 , the mid - plane value of @xmath0 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function , @xmath60 is defined so that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the local space density of cvs in the luminosity bin of width @xmath63 centred on @xmath64 . in other words , @xmath65 is the integral of @xmath1 over @xmath64 .    in calculating @xmath65",
    ", we will compare two assumptions regarding galactic scale height .",
    "first , as in @xcite , we take @xmath66 for long - period cvs , and @xmath67 for short - period systems , as a ( quite crude ) approximation of the fact that these are young and old populations , respectively .",
    "the second @xmath65 calculation uses a single scale height of @xmath67 for all systems , and gives results that are not significantly different ( see section  [ sec : rhoresult ] ) .",
    "this implies that the simpler approach of using only a single scale height is justified , and that is what we will assume in calculating @xmath1 ( the reason we require the simpler assumption for @xmath1 will be explained in section  [ sec : simphi ] ) .",
    "interstellar extinction is computed by integrating the density of the interstellar medium along each line of sight to obtain the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath43 .",
    "we again assume only vertical dependence in the density of gas ; i.e. , @xmath68 we take @xmath69 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and we find @xmath70 by assuming @xmath71 for @xmath72  deg @xcite , while the models of @xcite and @xcite give lower average values still .",
    "however , the results that will be presented in the next two sections are not sensitive to this assumption , and do not change significantly if we take the midplane extinction to be as low as @xmath73 .",
    "this is probably because the two surveys are restricted to quite high galactic latitudes . ] , and @xmath74 @xcite .    as discussed in section  [ sec : xlum ] , we will assume a @xmath42 thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum for all cvs in our sample .",
    "we will explain below that the @xmath0 calculation uses the maximum distance at which a given cv could have been detected .",
    "since this maximum distance depends on the ratio of @xmath45 to the flux limit , which may as well be expressed as a ratio of count rate to limiting countrate , the assumed x - ray spectral shape has very little influence on the @xmath0 calculation ( only the interstellar absorption depends on the x - ray spectrum ) .",
    "since the combined survey is complete ( up to the variable flux limit ) , we simply need to count the systems detected inside the observed volume to calculate @xmath0 ( and do the same in a set of luminosity bins to find @xmath1 ) . however , the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath57 , as well as the flux- rather than volume - limited nature of the sample need to be accounted for .",
    "both these complications are taken care of by the well - known @xmath75 method ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to find not only a best estimate of @xmath65 and @xmath1 , but also to estimate the errors on both , accounting for all sources of statistical error ( including distance errors , small number statistics , and observational error on @xmath45 or count rate ) .",
    "we describe in the following sections first how we implement the @xmath75 method , and then the monte carlo simulation to find the uncertainties on our measurements , as well as the numerical tests we use to verify that the error estimate for @xmath65 is correct .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath1 proves to be harder to estimate , and we will return to this issue in sections  [ sec : obsphi ] and [ sec : simphi ] .",
    "the @xmath75 method essentially allows the ` volume limit ' of the survey to vary according to the luminosities of the systems in the sample . for each observed system , we find the ` generalized ' ( i.e. , taking into account the exponential vertical density profile ) maximum volume , @xmath76 \\label{eq : v}\\ ] ] ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the index @xmath77 represents the cvs in our sample ; @xmath78 is the solid angle covered by the survey and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the maximum distance at which cv @xmath77 could have been detected ( given its luminosity and the survey flux limit ) .",
    "equation  [ eq : v ] assumes the spatial dependence of @xmath0 as given by equation  [ eq : z ] .",
    "@xmath81 is then the volume probed by the survey for sources with @xmath24 the same as the observed system @xmath77 . because @xmath82 ( and in the case of the nep survey , also the flux limit ) is variable over @xmath78 , we compute each @xmath81 as a sum over smaller solid angles , @xmath83 . for the rbs ,",
    "each @xmath83 is a slice subtended by @xmath84 in @xmath82 ( excluding the small area that is also covered by the nep survey ) , while the nep area is divided into a @xmath85 pixel grid . for both surveys ,",
    "the @xmath83 are sufficiently small that the error introduced by @xmath82 varying over @xmath83 is negligible .",
    "the space density @xmath65 is then the sum of the space densities represented by each cv , i.e. @xmath86 the luminosity function @xmath1 in a given luminosity bin is calculated similarly , by restricting the sum to systems in that luminosity bin .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath88 values for the systems in our sample , obtained with the maximum distance found by using the best @xmath89 and @xmath45 estimates , are given in table  [ tab : distances ] .",
    "these values thus neglect for the moment all uncertainties .",
    "we list them only as an indication of the contribution that each system makes to the total @xmath65 .      in order to find the error on @xmath65 , we compute its probability distribution function using a monte carlo simulation that finds @xmath65 ( as described above ) for a large number of mock samples with properties that fairly sample the parameter space allowed by the data .",
    "this also produces a best - estimate @xmath1 .",
    "the appropriate mock samples are generated as described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we treat each observed cv as a representative of a population of similar systems , and allow each population to contribute to each mock sample . for a given mock sample ,",
    "we generate 20 mock cvs by drawing @xmath45 and @xmath89 for a mock cv from the probability distribution functions ( gaussian errors in @xmath45 and @xmath89 distributions as computed in section  [ sec : dist ] ) of a real observed system ; thus each mock cv is the counterpart of one of the observed cvs .",
    "this takes care of the uncertainties in @xmath45 and @xmath89 ( or , combining those two parameters , @xmath24 ) . the poisson uncertainty associated with the small sample size",
    "is accounted for by a weighting factor , @xmath90 , drawn from the probability distribution of the number of sources belonging to the population ( corresponding to a particular observed system ) that one expects to detect in the combined survey .",
    "using bayes theorem , this distribution is related to the poisson distribution @xmath91 by @xmath92 where the actual number observed in the rbs and nep survey is @xmath93 , since we take each observed cv as representing a population of similar systems . as in @xcite , we use the uninformative prior @xmath94",
    ". then for each mock sample , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is found by summing only over the @xmath77 corresponding to mock cvs with luminosities placing them in that @xmath64 bin . we generate a large number of mock samples , and calculate @xmath65 and @xmath1 for each of them .",
    "we then add the @xmath1 values from all the mock samples in a given bin , and divide by the number of mock samples .",
    "the distribution of @xmath65 is normalized to give a probability distribution function .    in our @xmath65 calculation ,",
    "the largest part of the error budget comes from uncertainty in distance ( or , equivalently , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the calculation naturally yields the error on @xmath65 , but the situation for @xmath1 is more complicated ( see section  [ sec : test ] ) .",
    "we carried out several tests to confirm that the bayesian procedure outlined above produces reliable error estimates for @xmath65 .",
    "the input for each test is a galaxy model ( the same as assumed by equation  [ eq : z ] and [ eq : rho_ism ] ) , survey area and flux limit , and a cv luminosity function .",
    "we experimented with several different luminosity functions , as well as with including simulated errors in luminosity for the `` observed '' cvs .",
    "a given test first simulates an `` observed '' sample , and then calculates the @xmath65 distribution based on that sample in the same way as described above .",
    "this is repeated to generate many samples with their @xmath65 distributions ( note that for a given input , the samples do not all have the same size ) . for certain input luminosity functions",
    ", we found that for @xmath2268% of these simulated samples , the true input @xmath65 is contained a 1-@xmath39 interval of the calculated @xmath65 distribution .",
    "this holds when the combination of input flux limit and luminosity function produces an average of 20 sources per simulated sample , but also when the simulated samples are much larger , and the @xmath65 distributions become narrower .    the luminosity functions for which the tests fail ( in other words , for which we can not recover the input @xmath65 ) are those in which a significant contribution to @xmath0 is made up by systems so faint that none of them are included in the `` detected '' samples",
    "this is then what it means for the observed sample to be representative of the intrinsic population  at least one cv belonging to any intrinsically large population is detected .",
    "we perform similar tests to see if we can recover the luminosity function used as input .",
    "the result is that we can , but only when the errors in luminosity we assign to `` observed '' cvs are small compared to the size of the luminosity bins . in this case , we can always reliably place a given cv in a single @xmath24 bin , and the error on each @xmath1 bin can be found in the same way as the error on @xmath65 . however , clearly also here , we can not recover any faint end of the luminosity function beyond the faintest `` detected '' @xmath24 .",
    "when we simulate a survey where the errors on @xmath24 of the `` observed '' cvs are large , we recover a luminosity function that is broader and flatter than the input .",
    "furthermore , we can no longer find the error on a given @xmath1 bin as before , from the distribution of values in that bin .",
    "the reason for this is the correlation between @xmath97 and @xmath24 for that system .",
    "a fainter system can be detected only to a smaller distance , and hence yields a larger @xmath87 ; this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rholxcorr ] . to understand why the calculation does not give the error on @xmath1",
    ", one can consider constructing a luminosity function with bins sufficiently small that , for each mock sample , either 1 or 0 systems fall in a given @xmath24 bin .",
    "for some bin of this luminosity function , the value of @xmath1 , if it is not 0 , will be determined by the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rholxcorr ] , with relatively small scatter , determined by the weighting factor @xmath90 .",
    "the most important source of error will be gone , since @xmath24 is known , in a given bin .    for our real sample ,",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath24 are large enough that a given mock system is not always in the same @xmath24 bin ( even for very coarse bins ) , and in part because we compute @xmath1 over a large range in @xmath64 , a typical mock sample leads to many empty bins .",

    "population synthesis models predict that at most a few percent of all cvs are above the period gap ( @xcite finds less than 1% , while @xcite predict 3% ) .",
    "although we find that long - period systems account for slightly more than 50% of our total space density , the data do not rule out these theoretical predictions .",
    "for example , using the @xcite fraction of long - period systems , and assuming that we have not significantly under - estimated the space density of long - period cvs , the space density of short - period cvs is @xmath132 . using the upper limit on @xmath0 from section  [ sec : limits ] , we find that a short - period cv population of this size could escape detection in the two surveys , provided that the systems have @xmath133 ( for the simple case of a hypothetical single-@xmath24 population of faint , undetected cvs ) .",

    "however , we can also choose to place a restriction in terms of what we might consider reasonable x - ray luminosities for active cvs .",
    "for example , if we integrate the best - fit power law luminosity function over the range @xmath7 ( this is a luminosity range where cvs are known to exist , but where we detect none ) , we find @xmath134 for systems at those luminosities , a factor of almost 3 larger than our @xmath65 estimate from the detected cvs .",
    "this again indicates that it is reasonable to think that our @xmath65 estimate is low by a factor of more than 2 .",
    "we find that a power law x - ray luminosity function extending beyond @xmath135 is inconsistent with the observed sample .",
    "this is in agreement with figure 7 of @xcite , which shows that non - magnetic cvs should not be found at x - ray luminosities above @xmath136 .",
    "the main difficulty in constructing a luminosity function from the rbs and nep sample is that the distance estimates are very imprecise ( with errors @xmath137% in some cases , implying that @xmath24 is only very poorly constrained ; see section  [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "since parallax measurements are at the moment only available for a fairly small number of relatively bright cvs , this problem will persist until results from a mission such as _ gaia _ are available .",
    "we finally note that we have not considered the impact of variability on the x - ray luminosity function .",
    "the rass data were taken over a period of about 6 months , during which the ecliptic poles were observed many times , whereas lower ecliptic latitudes were covered only once @xcite .",
    "frequently outbursting dne in the nep area were therefore probably observed both in quiescence and in outburst , while most dne in the rbs sample were likely observed only in quiescence .",
    "to summarize , we have constructed a complete , purely x - ray flux - limited sample of 20 non - magnetic cvs , and have used it to place constraints on the space density and x - ray luminosity function of cvs .",
    "our main conclusions are listed below .    1 .   with the assumption that the combined non - magnetic cv sample from the rbs and nep surveys is representative of the intrinsic population , we find @xmath138 .",

    "<S> we combine two complete , x - ray flux - limited surveys , the _ rosat _ bright survey ( rbs ) and the _ rosat _ north ecliptic pole ( nep ) survey , to measure the space density ( @xmath0 ) and x - ray luminosity function ( @xmath1 ) of non - magnetic cvs . </S>",
    "<S> the combined survey has a flux limit of @xmath2 over most of its solid angle of just over @xmath3 , but is as deep as @xmath4 over a small area . </S>",
    "<S> the cv sample that we construct from these two surveys contains 20 non - magnetic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully include all sources of statistical error in calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 by using monte carlo simulations ; the most important uncertainty proves to be the often large errors in distances estimates . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the 20 cvs in the combined rbs and nep survey sample are representative of the intrinsic population , the space density of non - magnetic cvs is @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the difficulty in measuring @xmath1 in some detail  in order to account for biases in the measurement , we have to adopt a functional form for @xmath1 . assuming that the x - ray luminosity function of non - magnetic cvs is a truncated power law , we constrain the power law index to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that the two surveys have failed to detect a large , faint population of short - period cvs , and that the true space density may well be a factor of 2 or 3 larger than what we have measured ; this is possible , even if we only allow for undetected cvs to have x - ray luminosities in the narrow range @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath0 as high as @xmath8 would require that the majority of cvs has x - ray luminosities below @xmath9 in the 0.52.0  kev band .    </S>",
