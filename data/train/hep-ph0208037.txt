    "quantum chromodynamics is a non - abelian quantum field theory describing interactions between quarks and gluons .",
    "it describes the effect of confinement at low energy @xcite and asymptotic freedom at high energy @xcite compared to the qcd scale @xmath0 mev .",
    "the only known systematic approach to low energy qcd are lattice calculations .",
    "the physics of the high energy qcd can be controled by the perturbation analysis in strong coupling constant .",
    "there are three different types of phenomena of strong interactions which one can hope to describe in the perturbative regime : high energy scattering processes , high temperature and high baryon density systems .",
    "the energy scale for these phonomena are set by : the value of the four - momentum transfer @xmath1 exchanged in the process , the value of temperature @xmath2 and the value of the fermi energy @xmath3 ( or quark chemical potential @xmath4 ) respectively .",
    "the high energy scattering processes were already well tested in deep inelastic scattering of leptons on protons or electron - positon annihilation ( desy , cern ) .",
    "the samples of the matter at high temperature ( @xmath5 mev ) and low baryon density one can hope to achieve in high energy ions colliders ( rhic ) .",
    "however lattice calculations show that the expected temperatures are too low by the factor of 3 - 4 for the application of the perturbative qcd",
    ". then one has to rely on the non - perturbative analysis : lattice calculations , universal features of phase transitions or models .",
    "finally the high baryon density quark matter at low temperatures is expected to exist in the cores of the compact stars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , here also the densities are not high enough for direct perturbative calculations ( by many orders of magnitude ) . then the only possible approches are based on universal features of the phase transitions and models .",
    "the lattice approach fails at non - zero density physics because of the sign problem .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the high baryon density phases at @xmath6 . since long ago one expected supeconducting phenomena in this kinematical region @xcite .",
    "however only recently there have been a new interest in the subject because new features were found in the theory @xcite .",
    "if the energy scale is set by the quark chemical potential @xmath7 one can expect that at high enough densities there are a gas of free quarks and gluons .",
    "however the interaction between quarks mediated by the one - gluon exchange is attractive in the color @xmath8 channel .",
    "this leads to the well known phenomenon of the cooper instability of the fermi sea and finally results in the creation of a new vacuum - the condensate of cooper pairs .",
    "this is the version of the bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite applied to the interacting quark matter .",
    "the picture is generally correct , however somehow oversimplified .",
    "there are subtle but important differences between bcs theory and superconductivity in qcd which follow from the non - abelian character of the interation in quark - quark scattering ( eg .",
    "the review of the whole subject can be found in @xcite . despite of some differences the high density qcd shares a lot of features with condensed matter systems . indeed at high density the relativistic quantum field theory effects are suppressed and one can apply just non - relativistic field theory or relativistic quantm mechanics to study interesting phenomena .",
    "our subject of interest are scattering processes at the interfaces between different types of qcd phases .",
    "these are the analogs of the andreev reflection @xcite in condensed matter systems .",
    "this reflection apperas at the junction between conductors and superconductors . in the case of dense qcd",
    "the role of conductor is played by the free fermi gas of quarks and superconductor is 2sc or cfl phase of qcd . in this paper",
    "we consider the interface between 2sc and cfl phase .",
    "we shall show that this interface is the most general in a sense that it already contains the other cases : free quarks/2sc @xcite and more : 2sc/2sc and one only peculiar to 2sc / cfl .",
    "the case of free quarks / cfl interface @xcite has to be considered independently .",
    "the interest in the dynamics of the matter flow through the phase boundaries is of importance because such interfaces can be present in the protoneutron stars .",
    "indeed in the final stage of neutron star cooling one expects that the star can go through the all possible phase transitions @xcite including 2sc / cfl case .",
    "this last transition is expected to be the first order @xcite thus one expects the existence of the mixed phase : cfl - bubbles in the 2sc medium as well as 2sc - bubbles in the cfl medium .",
    "in such the conditions the andreev reflection is frequent phenomena and should be taken into account in the calculations of detail processes of the protoneutron star evolution .    in the sections 2 and 3 we provide the general introduction to superconductivity and andreev reflection in condensed matter systems .",
    "section four contains short description of 2sc and cfl phases , whereas in section five we describe the andreev reflection in qcd .",
    "there are also three appendices which gives more detailed calculations .",
    "let us start with the simple effective hamiltonian describing superconducting state of the system at zero temperature : @xmath9 .\\ ] ] the fermi field operator @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) describes the annihilation ( creation ) of the particle of mass @xmath12 and spin @xmath13 at the point @xmath14 and the time @xmath15 .",
    "the particles also carry charge however in our simple example we do not consider the electromagnetic fields thus this feature is unimportant for our purpose .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 defines the fermi surface below which all energy levels are occupied in accordance with pauli principle .",
    "the so called pair potential @xmath16 varies in space and describes the superconducting gap in excitation spectrum of the system - the essence of superconductivity .",
    "the last 2 terms in the above effective hamiltonian are a mean - field approximation of attractive four - fermi point interaction .",
    "the pair potential @xmath17 is related to the anomalous particle - particle correlator : @xmath18 one can treat this hamiltonian as the description of the interation between particles @xmath19 and given classical pair potential @xmath16 .",
    "we assumed that this interaction is independent of the spin . in that sense",
    "the spin is not dynamical degree of freedom but only a quantum number that distinguishes between 2 types of particles .",
    "let us mention that the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) does not conserve particle number .",
    "this results from the fact that the pair potential describes the condensate of cooper pairs which is a source of particles in our approximation .",
    "let us also notice that the energy is conserved however not necessarily momentum .",
    "the momentum conservation is related to the space dependence of the gap parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the equations of motion that follow from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and standard anticomutation relations for fermi fields take the form of so called bogoliubov - de - gennes equations @xcite : @xmath20 these operator equations are linear which means that we are free to treat them as the usual wavefunction equations ( hermitian conjugate changing to complex conjugate ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of the wavefunctions comes from the following reasoning . in the case of @xmath21",
    "the equations ( [ eom ] ) decouple from each other : @xmath22 the plane wave solutions : @xmath23 lead to the dispersion relations : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a measure of the kinetic energy with respect to fermi level and @xmath26 describes the energy excitation above ( below ) fermi energy for particles ( holes ) .",
    "let us mention the interesting detail that for the holes the group velocity is opposite to momentum @xmath27 thus the wavefunction @xmath28 describes the hole which is moving from right to left for @xmath29 .",
    "the above physical picture can be treated as a simple description of the conductors .",
    "the energy spectrum contains particles and holes in the vicinity of fermi surface which can be excited easily for the negligible cost of energy .",
    "let us now consider equations ( [ eom ] ) with @xmath30 , which gives us the model of superconductor .",
    "the plane - waves are still the solutions of ( [ eom ] ) : @xmath31 where momentum dependent constants satisfy the equations : @xmath32 the selfconsistency condition for the set of homogenous equations gives the dispersion relation :    @xmath33    this is famous gapped energy spectrum of the quasiparticles in the superconductor .",
    "the wavefunction describing quasiparticles are given by the solutions of ( [ eom_quasi ] ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a phase of the gap parameter , @xmath37 some constants and momenta of the excitations are given by the relations : @xmath38 the first ( second ) wave - function of ( [ quasi ] ) is particle - like ( hole - like ) excitation because for @xmath39 it reduces to the particle ( hole ) wavefunction .",
    "let us notice that for the excitation with energy @xmath40 the momenta are complex and thus quasiparticles do not propagate in the medium in such a case .",
    "let us consider the conductor - superconductor juction ( ns ) .",
    "this can be modeled by the equations ( [ eom ] ) when the pair potential takes appropriate shape . in the simplest case",
    "one can consider the plane junction perpendicular to the @xmath41 - axis located in the point @xmath42 .",
    "then the gap parameter is only a function of @xmath41 coordinate @xmath43 .",
    "the exact form of the pair potential depends on the details of the junction however some general features can be already obtained in the simple model of the step junction @xmath44 which describes a conductor for @xmath45 and superconductor with a constant gap @xmath17 for @xmath46 . the task is to solve the stationary problem of coupled schrodinger equations ( [ eom ] ) with boundary conditions :    1 .   for @xmath47 excitations are particles or holes ( conductor ) 2",
    ".   for @xmath48 excitations are quasiparticles ( superconductor ) 3 .   for @xmath42 wavefunctions and",
    "their first spatial derivatives are continuous .    for definitness let us consider that the particle of given energy @xmath26 incoming from the left hits the junction at @xmath42 .",
    "after the collision the particle and/or hole can be reflected back and the qusiparticles can be excited in superconductor .",
    "thus for the conductor side ( @xmath45 ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and the constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related to the probability of the reflection for the particle and hole , respectively . for the superconductor side ( @xmath46 )",
    "the wave - functions are given by formula ( [ quasi ] ) with @xmath53 .",

    "the constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 describe the probability of the particle - like and hole - like quasiparticles excitations . the continuity conditions at @xmath42 lead to the 4 equations for 4 constants @xmath61 and @xmath60 .",
    "the solutions of these equations are : @xmath62 thus one can conclude that the dominant contribution comes from the hole reflection in conductor and particle - like excitation in superconductor .",
    "the other contributions are suppresed by the powers of fermi energy . for",
    "the interpretation of our result let us consider the transition coefficients .",
    "from the equations ( [ eom ] ) follows the conservation of probability current : @xmath63 this probability current through the ns junction has a form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is fermi velocity .",
    "the result of the vanishing current for energies below the gap is exact .",
    "the transition and reflection coefficients read : @xmath66 thus for the energies of the incoming particle below the gap only the hole is reflected .",
    "this is easy to understand because there is no possibility to transport energy into the superconductor below the gap .",
    "let us notice that in the andreev reflection the charge is not conserved .",
    "this follows from the fact that our hamiltonian does not conserve particle number .",
    "obviously at the microscopic level the charge is conserved .",
    "the interpretation of the process is simple : the incoming particle creates the cooper pair with another particle from the fermi sea and `` dilutes '' in the condensate .",
    "the lack of the second particle is visible as a hole .",
    "additionally the andreev reflection process conserves the energy and momentum ( up to @xmath67 corrections ) .",
    "it is also called retro - reflection because the outgoing hole after reflection is a time reversal picture of the incoming particle before the reflection .",
    "this is approximate picture exact only in the limit of the vanishing particle energy @xmath68 .",
    "although the probability current vanishes at the ns junction the charge current is excessed .",
    "indeed the charge current at the conductor side is double because the particle and hole currents add to each other .",
    "the charge current is conserved at the interface thus at the superconducting side we also have to encounter doubled charge current .",
    "this current is carried by the condensate ( supercurrent ) itself because the quasiparticles penetrate only on the depth of the order @xmath69 .    for the energy of the incoming particle above the gap the coefficients @xmath70 and",
    "@xmath71 give us the probabilities of the reflection of the hole or the transmission of the quasiparticle into superconductor .",
    "for @xmath39 the coefficients @xmath72 as it should be .",
    "these predictions were checked experimentally many times , e.g. , by the direct measurement of the reflected holes @xcite .",
    "the andreev reflection can influence transport processes at the ns junctions which were already shown by andreev @xcite .",
    "other effects like excess current , charge imbalance and supercurrent conversion were also considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the perturbative approach to high density qcd is well established at much higher densities than one can expect in the cores of the compact stars .",
    "thus the use of models are inevitable in the description of interesting physics .",
    "this is the approach we chose in this paper .",
    "the one gluon exchange suggests that the diquark condensate is created in color and flavor anti - symmetric scalar channel .",
    "similar feature one can also find using instanton - based models .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing quark interaction with the pseudoscalar condensate at the high baryon density can be written in the general form ( for the review see @xcite ) : @xmath73\\ ] ] where @xmath74 are dirac bispinors , @xmath75 color indices , @xmath76 flavor indices , @xmath52 the charge conjugation matrix and @xmath4 is the quark chemical potential . at zero temperature",
    "the condensate @xmath77 is a vacuum expectation value of the 2-point field correlator : @xmath78 the formula ( [ hamiltonian_qcd ] ) is a relativistic generalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with the more complicated gap structure .    in the case of two flavors ,",
    "the gap matrix ( [ gap ] ) becomes : @xmath79 where the third direction in color space was chosen arbitrarily .",

    "the gap parameter takes the form : @xmath84 this is color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase .",
    "the gauge symmetry and global chiral symmetry are broken according to the scheme @xmath85 .",
    "the baryon @xmath86 symmetry is also broken .",

    "there is also additional nambu - goldstone boson connected to the breaking of restored axial symmetry @xmath87 .",
    "the value of the gap is model dependent of the order of the 2sc gap but usualy slightly smaller .",

    "after diagonalization of the matrix we can find 8 excitations with the gap @xmath17 and one excitation with the gap @xmath97 .",
    "these are octet and singlet representations of the unbroken @xmath98 symmetry .",
    "the detail calculations are given in appendix c.",
    "in this section , let us consider the andreev reflection at the interface consisting of two different superconductors in qcd , that is , the 2sc / cfl interface since we find it is the most general case among the possible interfaces . as is obvious from the expression of the gap matrix ( 21 ) with the conditions ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) , there are three kinds of possibilities of the quark scatterings at this interface .",
    "* @xmath99 and/or @xmath100 : in this case , the andreev reflection is similar to qgp/2sc because strange quark as well as blue up and down quarks are unpaired in the 2sc phase .",

    "we suggest that this combination is a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "indeed in the case of @xmath86 superconductors @xmath13 variable is responsible for many interesting physical phenomena like , for example , the josephson effect .",

    "if the protoneutron stars go through the first order phase transitions between qgp or / and 2sc or / and cfl phases during their history cooling then one can expect the mixed phase to be present in the core of the stars .",

    "@xmath155 remembering that relativistic effects are suppressed at high density the dirac field operator @xmath156 can have a one - particle interpretation of annihilating a fermion of given spin at the point @xmath157 in space - time .",
    "we can also change the operator equation ( [ eom_free ] ) into the wavefunction equation .",
    "the first equation of ( [ eom_free ] ) describes the particles and the second one the holes . using the decomposition : @xmath158 one can easily solve the equations ( [ eom_free ] ) . to finish this",
    "let us define the bispinors @xmath159 and @xmath160 through the equations : @xmath161 where @xmath162 describes the spin and momentum @xmath163 can be in general complex vector . from this reason one has to distinguish between the right- and left - handed eigenvectors , which are denoted by the capital letters @xmath164 . for complex @xmath163 @xmath165 is not hermitian conjugate to @xmath166 .",
    "the solutions of the equations take the form : @xmath167 where @xmath168 are spinors and where @xmath169 which is not interesting for our purposes ] . the spinors can be defined in the helicity basis : @xmath170 where @xmath171 .",
    "let us also define the additional bispinors : @xmath172 where @xmath173 and bispinors are given by formulae : @xmath174 the bispinors defined above fulfill simple algebraic relations which are useful in the calculations : @xmath175    the bispinors defined above together with ( [ decomp ] ) are solutions of ( [ eom_free ] ) and have simple physical meaning .",
    "the wavefunction : @xmath176 describes the particle of spin projection up , velocity @xmath177 , where @xmath178 and energy @xmath179 above the fermi sea . from the other hand the wavefunction : @xmath180 describes the hole of spin projection down , velocity @xmath181 , and energy @xmath182 below the fermi sea .      from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_qcd ] ) and the gap structure ( [ matrix ] ) for 2sc phase ( [ gaps ] ) , using usual commutation relations for fermi fields , one can derive the equation of motion : @xmath183 where we exchange the field operators by the wave functions similarly like in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "this can be done because the presence of the fermi sea suppresses the contribution of antiquarks .",
    "there is similar set of equations for another @xmath184 pair .",
    "it is convenient to use the plane wave decomposition : @xmath185 where the bispinors @xmath186 and @xmath187 are defined in appendix a. @xmath188 are some constants .",
    "the subscripts @xmath189 and @xmath190 describe flavor and color of quarks . plugging ( [ decomp_2sc ] ) into ( [ eom_2sc ] ) , using the relations given in appendix",
    "a one can find the wave functions @xcite : @xmath191 where @xmath36 is a phase of the gap parameter , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 are some constants .",
    "the first wavefunction describes the particle - like excitation whereas the second one describes the hole - like quasiparticle .",
    "this is quite similar to the description of the nonrelativistic quasiparticles .",
    "indeed if one compares ( [ wf_2sc ] ) with the wavefunctions ( [ quasi ] ) the similarity is striking .",
    "it also occurs that the andreev reflection in the qgp/2sc case is a direct analog of the andreev reflection at the nonrelativistic conductor / superconductor junction .",
    "let us now discuss the cfl quasiparticle waveufunctions for the states @xmath195 .",
    "the equations of motions that follow from ( [ hamiltonian_qcd ] ) take the form : @xmath196 to find the quasiparticle wavefunctions for @xmath197 , it is convenient to use the following decompositions : @xmath198 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are defined in appendix a. @xmath188 and @xmath199 are some constants .",
    "the subscripts @xmath189 and @xmath190 describe flavor and color of quarks in obvious way .",
    "plugging ( [ expand ] ) into ( [ eom_cfl ] ) , using the bispinor algebraic relations given in appendix a and assuming constant value of the gap parameter @xmath200 , one obtains the wavefunction describing the quasiparticle excitations of given energy @xmath26 in the cfl phase : @xmath201 \\exp{(-iet)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath202 .",
    "@xmath203 and @xmath204 . @xmath205 and @xmath140 are arbitrary constants .",
    "similar expression is obtained for the opposite spin content .",
    "instead of using @xmath195 basis one can use the cfl - basis : @xmath206 in which the gap matrix ( [ matrix ] ) is diagonal , where @xmath207 explicitly : @xmath208 in the cfl - basis one can write quasiparticle wavefinctions as : @xmath209 the excitation @xmath210 describes the singlet quasiparticle with the gap @xmath97 wheras @xmath211 describe octet quasiparticles with the gap @xmath17 .",
    "the probability currents : @xmath212 are conseved and can be used to calculte the transition coefficients in the scattering procesess .",
