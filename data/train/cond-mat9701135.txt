    "the advancement of fabrication and lithography techniques of semi - conductors have made it possible to investigate bi - layer systems made of two electronic two - dimensional layers at very close proximity ( several hundred angstroms ) in a very controlled manner . among the controllable parameters are the tunneling of electrons between the layers , the density of electrons at each layer , and external parameters such as the magnetic field and temperature .",

    "one of the measurements performed on systems of two electronic layers at close proximity is that of the transresistivity .",

    "( [ donald ] ) was discussed by various authors @xcite . here , we elaborate on some points that are essential to our discussion .",
    "drag resistivity stems from scattering events between electrons of different layers .",
    "this scattering results from the screened inter - layer coulomb interaction @xmath18 .",
    "scattering events transfer momentum @xmath71 and energy @xmath72 between the layers .",
    "phase space availability effectively constrains the energy transfer to be smaller than the temperature , as implied by the @xmath73 factor .",
    "the function @xmath68 is the single layer density - density response function , irreducible with respect to the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is defined in the following manner : suppose that one applies a weak scalar potential @xmath74 on a single layer ( in the absence of a second one ) . in linear response",
    "this potential leads to a particle density response @xmath75 , which induces a coulomb potential @xmath76 .",
    "the response function @xmath22 is the ratio of the induced density to _ total _ electric potential @xmath77 , @xmath78 since current conservation implies @xmath79 and the electric field is related to the potential by a gradient operator , the longitudinal conductivity @xmath80 , relating charge current to the electric field , is related to @xmath81 through @xmath82    the response function @xmath68 also determines the screening of the coulomb potential , both inter - layer and intra - layer .",
    "we denote the bare intra - layer coulomb interaction by @xmath83 and the bare inter - layer one by @xmath84 .",
    "it is convenient to describe the interaction by @xmath85 matrices , where the two entries correspond to the two layers .",
    "the interlayer screened coulomb interaction is the off - diagonal element of the matrix @xmath86 .",
    "the latter satisfies the equation @xmath87 with @xmath88 note the notation : @xmath89 are matrices , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are scalar functions .",
    "we now limit ourselves to the case of two identical layers , which is our main focus in this paper . for that case @xmath93 ,",
    "such that the subscript may be omitted .",
    "then , the screened inter - layer potential can be written as @xmath94 eq .",
    "( [ interscg ] ) can be understood in the following way .",
    "the screened potential is the potential induced in one layer by a test charge of magnitude one in the other layer , together with the screening cloud it creates .",
    "one can view a test charge in one layer as a sum of two charge distributions  a symmetric distribution , with the same test charge in both layers , and an antisymmetric distribution , with opposite test charges in the two layers .",
    "the bare coulomb potential induced by a symmetric distribution is @xmath95 , while the bare potential induced by an anti - symmetric distribution is @xmath96 .",
    "the two terms in ( [ interscg ] ) are the screened coulomb potentials induced by the symmetric and anti - symmetric distributions . for the case",
    "we consider here , of two coupled two - dimensional systems , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , such that , for @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "a symmetric distribution induces a screened coulomb potential , while an anti - symmetric one induces a screened coulomb potential of _ electric dipoles _ , whose dipole moment is @xmath102 .",
    "we now focus our attention on the product @xmath103 , a product that appears in eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ interscg ] ) , and suppressing , for brevity , the @xmath27 arguments of @xmath104 and @xmath22 , this product may be written as @xmath105 by eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) , the transresistivity will be determined by @xmath27 for which the product @xmath103 is large .",
    "thus , it is interesting to examine its poles .",
    "as we see below , @xmath106 does not have any poles , and therefore the only poles are the solutions to the equations , @xmath107 @xmath108 to illuminate the physical significance of the poles , we expressed @xmath22 in terms of the conductivity @xmath109 .",
    "the solutions to ( [ sympole ] ) and ( [ asympole ] ) are the dispersion relations for charge density modes : suppose that at time @xmath110 one sets up a symmetric charge modulation , @xmath111 in each of the two layers , and observes its time evolution .",
    "this charge modulation induces , in each of the layers , an electric field given by @xmath112 .",
    "the electric field generates , in turn , , a current @xmath113 in each of the layers .",
    "since @xmath114 , the current leads to a decay of the charge modulation .",
    "the dispersion relation corresponding to that decay is the one given in eq .",
    "( [ sympole ] ) .",
    "the second pole results from an anti - symmetric charge distribution , i.e. , a distribution in which at @xmath110 the charge modulation in the two layers is @xmath115 . in that case ,",
    "the electric field induced in the two layers is @xmath116 .",
    "again , this electric field leads to a decay of the charge modulation , following the dispersion relation given in eq .",
    "( [ asympole ] ) .    in both cases , when @xmath109 is real , the density modes are damped , and density modulations decay in time .",
    "when @xmath109 is purely imaginary , the solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ sympole ] ) and ( [ asympole ] ) are the plasma modes of the double layer system .      as pointed out by zheng and macdonald @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) is valid both in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field . a simple way of understanding that point is by following the derivation of ( [ donald ] ) , as given by zheng and macdonald . upon doing that",
    ", one finds that the derivation is unchanged in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "thus , the study of drag resistivity for the system at hand is reduced to a study of the density - density response function @xmath22 for electrons at @xmath1 . and it is there where the behavior of electrons at @xmath1 differs strongly from that of electrons at @xmath50 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath68 is carried out , following a similar calculation by halperin , lee and read ( hlr)@xcite , in the next section , and is summarized by eq .",
    "( [ pizz ] ) . for the description of the physical picture",
    "it is enough to quote the result for @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( with @xmath119 being the fermi velocity ) : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is , by definition , the thermodynamic electronic compressibility of the @xmath1 state , and @xmath122 .",
    "this form of @xmath22 is unique , and deserves a few comments : firstly , it is similar to the form of @xmath22 for a diffusive system at @xmath50 , namely , @xmath123 , but with the effective `` diffusion constant '' being linear in @xmath28 .",
    "( [ pieq ] ) describes , then , a very slow diffusion , where the diffusion constant vanishes for @xmath124 .",
    "this slow diffusion affects the dispersion relation of the two density relaxation poles of the screened coulomb potential , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ sympole ] ) and ( [ asympole ] ) .",
    "those become @xmath125 $ ] and @xmath126 $ ] , and describe a slow relaxation of density fluctuations , that eventually leads to a large drag resistivity . secondly , as revealed by surface acoustic waves experiments , explained by the composite fermion theory , and manifested in eq .",
    "( [ pieq ] ) , the @xmath28-dependence of the longitudinal conductivity of electrons at @xmath1 is very different from that of electrons at zero magnetic field . at @xmath50",
    "the electronic conductivity is usually at its maximum at @xmath127 , and decreases with increasing @xmath28 . at @xmath1 , in the absence of disorder , the longitudinal conductivity _ vanishes _ at @xmath127 , and increases linearly with increasing @xmath28 , as long as @xmath28 is not too large .",
    "again , this small longitudinal conductivity leads to a slow decay of density fluctuations , and thus to a large transresistivity .",
    "thirdly , eq .   ( [ pieq ] ) describes a strong suppression of @xmath128 for large values of @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath28 integral in ( [ donald ] ) is _ not _ dominated by the upper cut - off @xmath129 , as is the case at @xmath50 , but rather by the solution @xmath130 of eq .",
    "( [ asympole ] ) . since the @xmath16 integral",
    "is dominated by @xmath131 , the most important contribution to the transresistivity comes from the region @xmath132    substituting eq .",

    ", this condition amounts to @xmath136    with the above discussion in mind , the origin of the dependence of @xmath2 on the range of the coulomb interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) ] can be understood .",
    "interactions decaying slower than @xmath137 lead to a faster relaxation of long wavelength density fluctuations , and thus to a less singular temperature dependence of @xmath2 ( although still more singular than the @xmath138-dependence of non - interacting electrons ) . the case of short range interactions is discussed below .",
    "we now comment on the temperature dependence of the transresistivity when the electron density in the two layers is varied such that the filling fraction is slightly away from @xmath1 .",
    "the transresistivity is again determined by eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) , with the crucial ingredient being the density - density response function @xmath22 .",
    "for the analysis of @xmath68 we resort to the composite fermion approach .    for @xmath0 slightly away from @xmath25 , a new length , the composite fermion cyclotron radius , @xmath139 , and a new frequency scale , the composite fermion cyclotron frequency , @xmath140 are introduced .",
    "as long as @xmath139 is larger than the transport mean free path @xmath141 , introduced by disorder , the composite fermion dynamics is , to a large extent , unaffected by the effective magnetic field they are subject to .",

    "moreover , even when @xmath139 is smaller than the disorder - induced mean free path , scattering events between composite fermions might suppress the sensitivity of the composite fermions to the effective magnetic field they are subject to .",

    "the calculation of the electronic density - density response function necessitates a notation for single layer response functions .",

    "measurements of the dependence of the transresistivity on a density bias between the two layers were done in the past as a way of separating out coulomb drag and phonon drag mechanisms .",
    "a calculation of the dependence of @xmath2 on such a density bias could therefore be useful for such measurements at @xmath1 .",

    "our motivation for studying this case stems from the ambiguous experimental picture of spin polarization at the @xmath8 state @xcite .",
    "while transport measurements at tilted magnetic fields indicate only a partial spin polarization of the @xmath8 state , surface acoustic waves measurements do not seem to support such a picture @xcite .",
    "we therefore attempt to find out whether a measurement of transresistivity can shed light on the spin polarization of the @xmath8 state .",
    "we regard the @xmath8 state as a superposition of a @xmath205 state of electrons and a @xmath1 state of holes , a picture which is valid when the electronic landau level separation @xmath206 is much larger than the temperature and the coulomb energy scales , such that landau level mixing can be neglected . under these conditions",
    "the contribution of the electronic @xmath205 state to the single - layer density - density response function @xmath22 is exponentially small for the relevant frequency range @xmath207 , due to the energy gap between the @xmath208 and @xmath209 electronic landau levels .",
    "the transresistivity is therefore almost solely due to the @xmath1 state of the holes",
    ".    the spin polarization of the @xmath1 hole state may be anywhere between zero and full polarization .",

    "when considering a partially polarized state , one expects all relevant functions ( @xmath210 of eqs .",
    "( [ screened ] ) and ( [ matrixdef ] ) ) to acquire spin indices .",
    "as a first step , then , a convenient choice of a basis may be helpful .",

    "@xmath217 the screened coulomb interaction has a structure similar to ( [ barespinb ] ) , since it , too , couples only to charge densities , and does not depend on spin densities .",
    "consequently , the only component of the response function @xmath22 that affects the transresistivity is the one coupling charge density to charge density . for the fully polarized case",
    ", it is given by eq .",
    "( [ pieq ] ) .",
    "we now turn to discuss this component in the other extreme case , that of zero spin polarization .    in principle , one may envision several chern - simons transformations that might be applicable to the fully unpolarized @xmath1 state . at @xmath1",
    "there are two flux quanta per a hole .",
    "one possible transformation attaches four flux quanta to each hole , and allows an interaction only between same - spin composite fermions .",
    "this transformation creates a correlated wave function of same - spin holes , and reduces the probability of finding two same spin holes very close to one another @xcite .",
    "it does not , however , do the same for holes of different spin directions .",
    "thus , while the coulomb energy cost associated with holes of identical spins is reduced , that of holes of different spin directions is unaffected .",
    "an energetically favorable transformation , that reduces the coulomb energy of both types of interactions , is one that attaches two flux quanta to each hole , and allows an interaction that is independent of the spin direction .",
    "the correlations induced by this transformation are , at least on the rpa level , spin - independent .",
    "we use the second transformation .",
    "the calculation of @xmath22 is similar to that leading to eq .",
    "( [ pizz ] ) .",
    "( [ picf ] ) still holds , although @xmath218 and @xmath219 become single layer @xmath220 matrices , with the entries corresponding to densities and transverse current of two spin states . within mrpa , in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath211 ,",
    "the response function @xmath221 is a block - diagonal matrix with two pairs of identical blocks , denoted by @xmath222 ( note that @xmath223 are @xmath85 matrices with entries corresponding to density and transverse current ) . since in our choice of the chern - simons transformation",
    "the chern - simons interaction is independent of the spin direction , it is again more convenient to transform the spin states from eigenstates of @xmath211 to @xmath224 ( and similarly for transverse currents ) .",

    "( [ pieq_th ] ) is very similar to eq .",
    "( [ pizz ] ) , the corresponding response function for the polarized state .",
    "quantitatively , there are three differences : a factor of @xmath227 in the numerator resulting from the presence of two spin directions , a factor of @xmath228 originating from the interaction of each composite fermion with flux tubes carried by fermions of @xmath229 spin directions , and a factor @xmath230 difference between @xmath231 and @xmath232 , originating from the difference between the fermi wave - vector at the polarized and unpolarized states .",
    "we note , by passing , that this quantitative difference between @xmath22 of the fully unpolarized state and @xmath22 of the fully polarized state should be observable in measurements of the @xmath28-dependent conductivity using surface acoustic waves .",
    "for example , one might imagine a measurement of surface acoustic waves attenuation in a @xmath8 state as a function of a magnetic field applied parallel to the two dimensional electronic system .",
    "if the parallel magnetic field modifies the spin polarization of the @xmath8 state , a significant change in @xmath233 should be observable .",

    "( [ impiv ] ) and eq .",

    "secondly , the bare interaction should be multiplied by @xmath227 , to account for the factor @xmath227 in the numerator of ( [ pieq_th ] ) . and thirdly , the fermi momentum @xmath52 appearing in the electronic density - density response function ( [ pizz ] )",
    "should be divided by @xmath235 . neglecting @xmath43",
    "compared to @xmath35 , we then find that the transresistivity in the unpolarized case is larger , by a factor of @xmath66 compared to that of the polarized case .",
    "in this paper we considered the coulomb drag between two layers of two dimensional electron gases in a strong magnetic field , when the filling fraction in each layer is at , or close , to @xmath1 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and the electrons in each layer form a compressible state . using the composite fermion approach to analyze the properties of each layer , and an electronic approach to analyze the coupling between the layers , we find that the unique linear @xmath28-dependence of the longitudinal conductivity , @xmath236 , at and close to even denominator filling fractions , lead to a unique temperature dependence of the transresistivity between two layers , @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to previous works , we do not associate this temperature dependence to the nature of the liquid formed by composite fermions , but rather interpret it as a result of the slow relaxation of density fluctuations in a compressible partially filled landau level .",
    "we examine the transresistivity at @xmath8 and find that it depends significantly on the spin polarization of the @xmath8 state .",
    "we therefore propose that measurements of @xmath2 at @xmath8 might shed light on that polarization , which so far is not well understood .",

    "the properties of each layer are analyzed using approximation schemes for the composite fermion problem .",
    "we find that @xmath2 depends mostly on the strength of the coulomb interaction and on geometrical factors , such as the inter - layer and inter - electron distance .",
    "its dependence on masses , whether bare or effective , is rather weak .",
