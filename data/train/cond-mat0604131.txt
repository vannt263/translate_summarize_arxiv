    "recent simulations of lc near rough walls @xcite using such a model have shown that properties such as the anchoring coefficient and transition pressures of a confined lc are influenced by the roughness of the substrate . due to the computational expense only a few surfaces at a given roughness",

    "the density distribution of the matrix , averaged over all matrix realisations , is determined though minimisation of a grand potential in the absence of the fluid .",
