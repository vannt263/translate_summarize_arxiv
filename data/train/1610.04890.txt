    "in recent decades researchers have focused their interest on materials in the nano - scale regime . the blue shift in band - gap of materials as their grain size reduces",
    "is well established .",
    "@xcite also , when the particle size of noble metals such as gold , silver etc are reduced to the nano - scale , one observes interesting changes in their physical and chemical properties .",
    "for example , when the metal grain size is of the order of the incident light s wavelength , the free electrons of the metal are set into oscillation .",
    "the collective / quantized oscillation of these electrons are called plasmons .",
    "@xcite at a certain wavelength of the incident light , they resonate .",
    "this phenomenon is called surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) .",
    "@xcite the main attraction of spr is the tunability of the absorbance in the uv - visible range based on the metal nano - particle s size and shape along with their and their surrounding medium s dielectric constant .",
    "@xcite spr finds application in sensors and scintillation screens .",
    "@xcite    recent works by the authors have shown that alkali halides , such as cesium bromide and cesium iodide , may give spr peaks in their absorption spectra either by inclusion of silver metal nano - particles  @xcite or due to segragation of cesium from the cesium halide molecule on the formation of color centers with aging .",
    "@xcite fig  [ summary2 ] is a pictorial representation of cesium nano - rods formation in cesium iodide background . within the grains of csi films ( shown in the cross - sectional view in fig  [ summary2 ] ) ,",
    "color centers are formed with the halide centers jumping out of the lattice .",
    "these lattices of only cesium metal atoms take - up tetragonal lattice structure and apply strain on neighbouring csi unit cells .",
    "@xcite the strain results in the csi unit cells to take up a tetragonal structure .",
    "meanwhile , cesium metal structures migrate towards the grain boundary where grain division results in cesium nano - rods .",
    "@xcite thus explaining the segragation of cesium from cesium iodide with time ( ageing ) .",
    "it is these metal nano - rods in csi background ( not shown in fig  [ summary2 ] ) that results in spr peaks in the uv - visible absorption spectra .",
    ", width=264 ]    as stated previously , the spr peak position is strongly influenced by the dielectric constant ( refractive index ) of the background material .",
    "in fact , the matrix background s dielectric constant ( @xmath3 ) is an important input parameters in standard models which are used for estimating the spr peak positions , like the mie  @xcite or gans model .",
    "@xcite however , due to the transparent nature of the cesium iodide films , the experimental determination of its refractive index , an in term dielectric constant in the visible range , is very difficult .",
    "hence , the dielectric constant of csi reported in literature is usually obtained by theoretical considerations .  * ? ? ?",
    "* however , the emphasis in all the reports have been on the insulator to metal transition that occurs when the unit cell is under pressure , with pressure applied being isotropic .",
    "this results in the variation in lattice parameters abid with the simple cubic structure maintained . hence",
    ", using data from literature would at best give results that are indicative in nature .",
    "since , dielectric constant of cesium iodide with tetragonal unit cell structure is not reported , we have evaluated the same theoretically using abinit ( version 8.0.8 ) .",
    "abinit is a standard package/ software used to compute the energy band structure diagram for evaluation of band - gap ( @xmath4 ) , the density of states ( dos ) and dielectric constant ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the following section discusses the theoretical background of the software and the results generated by our calculations .",
    "there are two methods by which the quantum mechanical behaviour of electrons in a crystal can be evaluated . the first is called the pseudo - potential ( pp ) method .  @xcite the pp theory excludes the core - shell electrons from consideration while determining the oscillating wave functions",
    ". the results are hence smooth ( pseudo ) wave functions of valence electrons that can be decomposed in a series for about @xmath6 plane waves , as compared to the true all - electron ( including inner shell electrons ) wave functions which would be a series of @xmath7 plane waves .",
    "the second method involves including all the electrons and is called the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( flapw ) .  @xcite in this approach , the volume of the crystal is divided into two regions",
    ". sites of the atoms are represented by spheres called the muffin - tin spheres ( mt ) , while the remainning is empty space/ volume of the crystal surrounding the mt spheres is termed  the interstitial region \" .",
    "the flapw basis functions are represented within these two regions as @xmath8 & \\text{muffin - tin sphere}\\\\ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the vector terms are shown in bold .",
    "the charge density is given as ( the potential is also defined in similar way ) @xmath9 for this article , we have used the projector augmented waves ( paw ) method .",
    "@xcite this method uses features of both above mentioned approaches , namely , pp and flapw . as in flapw , the crystal is mapped into two parts , the so - called spheres of augmentation centered at atom sites and the interstitial region .",
    "the representation of the wave function in these two regions is also different . within the augmentation sphere , near the center",
    ", the wave function of the core electron is represented by atomic partial waves , @xmath10 but in the middle and peripheral part of the sphere , the pseudo wave function is expressed in terms of auxiliary partial waves @xmath11 in the interstitial region the smooth pseudo wave function is expanded as plane waves @xmath12 the crystal s all electron wave function of an electron is hence composed of these three components and is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the projector function .",
    "the all electron function is derived from the pseudo wave function by the transformation operator @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 and ` i ' is the identity operator.one can now substitute this expression into the schrodinger wave equation and then solve the eigenvalue problem written in the form @xmath18 results and discussion ----------------------      in its natural state , cesium iodide crystal takes a simple cubic structure , with the center of the cube being occupied by an iodine atom and cesium atoms positioning themselves at the corners of the cube ( see fig  [ summary ] ) .",
    "this arrangements of the atoms implies that there are two atoms per unit cell with p4/mmm space symmetry . for the unstrained lattice ,",
    "the lattice paramters ( a=4.57 ) taken were those reported in the astm card no .",
    "06 - 0311 .",
    "the electronic properties of csi crystal were evaluated by means of the abinit code .  @xcite the exchange - correlation function of predew- burke- emzerhof ( pbe ) was used for calculations .",
    "@xcite the projector augmented waves ( paw ) method was used for solving the system of equations given in the previous section with respect to crystal eigenenergies @xmath19 and pseudo wave functions @xmath20 .",
    "the paw basis states have been generated by means of the atompaw program  @xcite for the valence basis states of @xmath21 for cesium and @xmath22 for iodine .",
    "the system of equations was solved self - consistently and the full convergence of the binding energy of the unit cell was achieved with accuracy of @xmath23  ha .",
    "the calculations for the unstrained lattice allowed us to verify our theoretical calculations with those determined and reported experimentally ( 6  ev ) .",
    "@xcite    , width=188 ]    .[tablei ] listing of lattice paramters which were used for calculations in this study .",
    "the lattice parameters were experimentally observed in a previous study by the authors.@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     0.1 cm    while the variation of the band - gaps ( both direct and indirect ) showed a linear increase with lattice parameter ` c ' , it linearly decreased with increasing ` a ' ( fig  [ linear ] ) . hence , both lattice parameters , ` a ' and ` c ' play an important role in the formation of bands and in turn band - gap in csi . however , considering the contribution of the valence band came from the iodine atoms and the conduction bands were contributed by the cesium s d - orbital , it would be interesting to establish whose contribution influences csi s band - gap under stress .",
    "for this , we did a chi - square fit to determine the functional dependence of @xmath4 on the two independent variables .",
    "the calculations were done using standard software ( origin 8.0 ) .",
    "a very good fit , with low residual ( @xmath24 ) was obtained @xmath25 fig  [ 3dbandgap ] shows the 3d plot with family of curves along with the theoretically determined band - gaps for tetragonal lattices .",
    "the family of curve essentially helps us to visualize the variation in @xmath4 when one of the lattice parameters is held constant .",
    "the equation ( eqn  [ chi ] ) and the graph clearly shows that the band - gap strongly depends on the change in lattice parameter ` c ' compared to ` a ' .",
    "clearly , the interaction of cesium - iodine atoms plays a more prominent role as compared to the cesium - cesium atoms interaction .",
    "0.2 cm    the systematic variation in band - gap of csi under stress would also reflect in other optical properties such as refractive index , or dielectric constant .",
    "theoretical calculations with abinit were extended for determining the dielectric constant of csi for the lattice constants listed in table  i. fig  [ epr1](a ) shows the variation of the real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant with incident photon energy . in the uv - visible - nir region ( region of our interest )",
    "we find the imaginary component to be non - existing , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "this is expected since csi films/ crystals are transparent in nature and hence non - absorbing in visible and large uv wavelengths .",
    "the real component of the dielectric constant increases as the wavelength decreases ( as we move from nir to uv wavelengths ) .",
    "fig  [ epr1](b and c ) shows the variation of @xmath27 with lattice parameters .",
    "the trend is inverse to the trend seen in band - gaps ( fig  [ linear ] ) , e.g. while the band - gap increased with increasing ` c ' , @xmath28 decreases with increasing ` c ' .",
    "shukla et  al  @xcite did theoretical calculations for varying lattice constants of  cubic \" csi and reported decreasing dielectric constant with increasing lattice paramter .",
    "however , the work does not relate to experimental results since csi under stress takeup tetragonal structure .    in the following section ,",
    "the dielectric constants obtained from here are used as input parameters for gans model simulation .",
    "the simulation would theoretically predict the peak in extinction peak position ( @xmath2 ) indicating surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) caused due to the formation in nano - clusters of metal particles .",
    "the absorption spectra of metallic nanoparticles can be explained by mie theory , which essentially is maxwell s equations solved with appropriate boundary conditions corresponding to light interacting with spheical metal particles . as the electric field of the light wave oscillates , electrons of the metal move resulting in a polarization given as @xmath29e_o\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ` @xmath5 ' is the complex dielectric constant ( @xmath30 ) of the metal nano - particles of radius ` a ' and ` @xmath31 ' is the dielectric constant of the surrounding media . a maximum , corresponding to resonance",
    "is achieved when the denominator ( @xmath32 ) is a minimum .",
    "the extinction coefficient of spherical particles is given by @xmath33 shows the dependency of the dielectric constants of metal and the surrounding medium .",
    "gan  @xcite extended the mie theory for non - spherical particles and showed that the above equation needs modification for nano - particle that are deformed from spherical shapes and have taken an ellipsoid ( prolate/ oblate ) shape . according to theory",
    ", spr oscillations occur in two directions of the ellipsoid .",
    "the theory predicts splitting of spr into longitudinal and transverseal modes when light is incident along or perpendicular to the major axis , respectively .",
    "@xcite the extinction coeffiecient ( @xmath34 ) for the ellipsoid shaped nano - particle is given as @xmath35 ^ 2}\\ ] ] where ` v ' is the volume occupied by the particle , @xmath36 the angular frequenecy of the incident light , ",
    "c \" is the speed of light and @xmath37 is the polarization factor along the three axes a , b and c of the ellipsoid , with @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath37 is defined as ( j subscript identifies the axis a , b or c )  @xcite @xmath39\\ ] ] and ` e ' is the aspect ratio ( which defines the shape of the non - spherical metal particle ) given by @xmath40^{1/2}\\ ] ] again , the denominator of the scattering extinction coefficient should be minimum for the resonance .",
    "mathematically , the resonance condition is given by @xmath41 ^ 2+\\epsilon^2_2=min\\ ] ] thus , the nature of spr peaks depends on the shape and the dielectric constant of the metal as well as the nano - particle s surrounding media ( via it s dielectric constant @xmath31 ) . for gan model calculations",
    ", we have assumed the cesium metal structure to be nano - rod or ellipsoidal shaped with an aspect ratio of 0.86 ( same as that observed in our earlier experimental studies ) .",
    "for this aspect ratio , the peak due to longitutional and transverse modes are very near and unresolvable , giving an appearance to a very broad peak .",
    "also , instead of a constant @xmath31 for csi background , we have used the theoretically evaluated @xmath42 .",
    "0.2 cm    since the stressed csi lattice showed anisotropic behavior , we have done theoretical calculations ( gan model ) with light incident along ` a ' and ` c ' axis respectively .",
    "fig  [ gan ] shows gan model calculations for cubic and tetragonal lattice structured csi when light is incident along ` a ' and ` c'-axis respectively .",
    "a red - shift in @xmath2 is clearly evident as we repeat our calculations for lattice parameters listed from s.no .",
    "1 to 5 of table i. that is , a red - shift in the spr peak position is evident with increasing stress in the lattice .",
    "it might appear strange that a red - shift in spr peak position is seen in both graphs of fig  [ gan ] considering the inverted slopes of fig  [ epr1 ] ( b and c ) .",
    "however , because of the inverted slope , as lattice parameter ` a ' increases ( and ` c ' decreases ) from s.no . 1 to 5 of table i , @xmath43 increases .",
    "this increase in the background s dielectric constant , @xmath43 results in a red - shift in @xmath2 .",
    "also , since the slopes of the curves in fig  [ epr1 ] ( b and c ) show that the variation in @xmath43 along ` a ' direction ( @xmath0 ) is stronger than that along the ` c ' direction ( @xmath1 ) , a more prenounced red - shift in @xmath2 is seen along the ` a'-axis of the deformed cesium iodide s lattice .",
    "the theoretical results are in agreement with the results presented by kuldeep et  al .",
    "@xcite however , the red shift reported experimentally was more than what we have evaluated here .",
    "this may be due to the commulative effect of cesium grain size and surrounding dielectric coming into play in the experimental study , where it was impossible to resolve the contribution from each factor .",
    "in conlcusion , we were able to calculate the electronic energy bands and dielectric constant of cesium iodide crystals taking into account the tetragonal lattice .",
    "tetragonal lattices of csi experimentally occur when color centers form within the csi matrix .",
    "the color centers give rise to non - uniform deformation of csi unit cell along the ` a ' and ` c ' directions .",
    "the energy band gaps calculated here are in good agreement with experimental results .",
    "finally , the dielectric constants have been calculated for all the deformed lattices ( table i ) .",
    "the theoretical results give important input parameters needed for gan model calculation of extinction coefficients of csi .",
