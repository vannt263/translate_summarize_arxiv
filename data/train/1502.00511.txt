    "<S> quantum devices based on josephson effect in superconductors are usually described by a hamiltonian obtained by commonly used canonical quantization . however , this recipe has not been yet rigorously justified . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this approach is indeed correct in certain range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find the condition of the validity of such quantization and the lowest corrections to the josephson energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the josephson effect @xcite is one of most fundamental phenomena occurring in physical systems with macroscopic quantum effects . when biased by external capacitance , inductance or current source , it becomes the basis for the description of many superconducting quantum devices such as cooper pair boxes , flux and phase superconducting qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that such structures can be promising elements for quantum computing @xcite and violation of local realism ( bell test , although only local at present ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed theoretical description of such a system becomes more and more necessary for its highly complex and demanding experimental applications .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest , and to date most popular and phenomenological description of the quantum devices based on josephson effect is derived from current - phase relation , phase - voltage relation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum properties of josephson junction are extracted by using conjugated observables for example between number particles ( charge ) and phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy stored in capacitor decides whether we deal with cooper pair box , flux or phase qubit . on the other hand , the whole system is already originally quantum , with superconductor ( conventional , @xmath0-wave ) described at least by standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer </S>",
    "<S> ( bcs ) theory @xcite so there should be no need to quantize it again . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical quantization procedure is just a shortcut between the full quantum description and the approximated model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> certainly one should be able to justify this procedure and find the range of its validity . </S>",
    "<S> a partial justification has been developed 30 years ago @xcite , where the effective action of the josephson junction has been found and  in path integral picture of quantum mechanics  the canonically quantized hamiltonian is revealed in the tunneling limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , that approach does not give an answer to a very relevant question of the range of validity , except qualitative statement that phase fluctuations should be smaller than the superconductor energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that tunneling limit ( low transmission through the junctions ) is not a sufficient condition as both transmission , number of modes and capacitance play the role . </S>",
    "<S> if one simply takes tunneling limit at constant capacitance then also whole useful quantum properties are lost . </S>",
    "<S> phase fluctuations are indeed intuitively of the order of capacitance energy but one has to settle it quantitatively .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the approximate hamiltonian ( corresponding to the one obtained by canonical quantization ) straight from bcs hamiltonian , using standard perturbative approach with both transmission _ and _ capacitance treated as small parameters . by introducing phase - dependent eigenstates , the formalism takes much analogy from adiabatic and nonadiabatic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the lowest order , which can be called _ </S>",
    "<S> adiabatic approximation _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one indeed finds the desired simple effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the next order modifies josephson energy and ratio of this modification gives the range of applicability of the adiabatic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the modification contains an _ infinite _ term , which is fortunately phase - independent and so it has no physical relevance , and appears also in the non - superconducting case . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - dependent part can be calculated analytically also for large transmission , but it is rather technical so the details are presented in supplemental material @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) quantum energy levels in the potential landscape , title=\"fig : \" ]    let us begin with the sketch of the common canonical quantization of an electric circuit with josephson effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phq ] , consists of the josephson junction ( jj ) , effective capacitance @xmath4 and bias inductance @xmath1 or current @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the total hamiltonian will be the sum of the contributions of all these elements . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the charge and @xmath7 is the voltage between @xmath8 and @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> . the voltage can be represented by _ phase _ @xmath10 change ratio @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for the respective superconducting phases @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , @xmath14 with the current @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can consider current bias @xmath2 giving the term @xmath16 ( @xmath2 is then the current between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in absence of other elements ) . </S>",
    "<S> the _ classical _ picture leads to relation @xmath17 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the josephson current is calculated as @xmath18 @xcite . using the above classical equation , </S>",
    "<S> this leads to josephson energy @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> now , the canonical quantization means that we take the hamiltonian @xmath20 as a function of conjugate variables @xmath10 and @xmath6 and replace everything by their quantum counterparts , including conversion of poisson bracket into commutator between @xmath10 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it essentially means @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the canonical quantization of the @xmath22 part ( @xmath23 ) is already well justified by quadratic form of the electromagnetic action @xcite , whose lagrangian density has the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25,@xmath26,@xmath7,@xmath27,@xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 denote electric and magnetic field , scalar and vector potential , charge density and current , electric and magnetic permittivity , respectively , and linear relations between @xmath7 and @xmath32 , @xmath6 and @xmath28 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , one has to assume ideal models of capacitance and inductance , which will surely break down at high frequencies or voltages ( e.g. leakage currents ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the useful range of quantum operation parameters is well within the regime of validity of the assumed model of the @xmath22 part . </S>",
    "<S> one usually considers the classical turning points defined by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 can be approximated by @xmath36 with the exact crossing point @xmath37 , equivalent to current bias term @xmath38 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phq]b . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the most suspicious part of this procedure is not the quantization of @xmath39 or @xmath4 terms but jj . on one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the josephson effect is crucial for the appearance of quantum levels in the potential landscape , see fig.[phq]c . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the effect is no longer quadratic and originally derived straight from bcs theory plus tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> it is intuitive that going back - and - forth between quantum and classical description is not always accurate and may lead to losing some corrections . to find this accuracy is the main goal of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall model the full hamiltonian of the superconductor ( @xmath0-wave ) by the standard bulk bcs part written in the bogoliubov - de gennes framework @xcite @xmath40 , plus tunneling term @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use the relation between second and first quantized hamiltonian @xmath42 with anticommutation @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 can be multi - component ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first quantization hamiltonian @xmath46 is defined in a one - dimensional bispinor basis @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath47 is the ( real ) position in the superconductor @xmath8 or @xmath9 and @xmath49 denotes electron / hole . in the standard bcs approximation ( small superconducting gap ) , for a single channel , we have @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the same in subspaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 while @xmath53 has different phase in electron and hole subspace . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 is the superconducting gap and position is represented in time units divided by @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> normal scattering matrix is then @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58,@xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> one can add the overall phase @xmath60 to the scattering matrix by modifying @xmath61 ( accounting interface properties ) but it will not change any of our results and hence we can safely disregard it . we stress that putting @xmath10 into the tunneling term instead of varying phases at @xmath54 in the bcs part is only matter of the gauge choice . in our gauge </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath10 corresponds simply to the vector potential across the junction @xmath62 so that superconducting phases remain constant all the time .    </S>",
    "<S> now one can calculate the ground energy ( we focus on zero temperature case ) of the whole hamiltonian assuming fermi level at @xmath63 ( all states with negative energy @xmath64 are occupied ) . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson effect follows from the fact that this energy is _ phase - dependent_. the spectrum of @xmath52 consists of continuum positive and negative parts separated by the gap @xmath65 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> introducing @xmath53 modifies the wavefunction of these ( now scattering ) levels but not their energies . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath53 allows for new , so - called andreev bound states ( abs ) @xcite , with energies inside the gap @xmath66 and hence localized at the junction point ( @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these energies ( see detailed calculation in supplemental material @xcite which is anyway quite straightforward @xcite ) are equal @xmath68 and , for small @xmath69 , @xmath70 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ abslev ] . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath71 , and summing over independent channels , @xmath72 , as usually jj contains many , we have the desired canonical quantized scheme . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the josephson current can be justified as @xmath73 by means of full counting statistics @xcite , where @xmath74 in the ground state , which follows from keldysh formalism @xcite , and is in fact equivalent to josephson s original derivation @xcite .     and below @xmath75 and two phase - dependent abss in the gap . </S>",
    "<S> possible excitations of the ground state : ( a ) between abss , ( b ) between an abs and continuum , ( c ) between lower and upper continuum . ]    the above presented analysis , although leads to the desired result , is incomplete . </S>",
    "<S> it is not only the energy that changes with the phase @xmath10 but also the whole wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> one has to ensure that correction from these changes is sufficiently small in the quantum operation regime , defined by @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the argument that wavefunction changes become small for @xmath77 ( i.e. @xmath78 ) is insufficient because all relevant quantum properties ( energy levels ) disappear in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> to find rigorously the range of validity of the canonical approximation we have to calculate the effect of wavefunction changes .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall treat the problem by standard perturbative approach , keeping @xmath79 and @xmath80 as the small parameters _ at the same order_. without @xmath81 we are left with the ground state of @xmath40 hamiltonian , denoted by @xmath82 , degenerated by all possible values of @xmath10 and energy @xmath83 ( reference value ) . </S>",
    "<S> all excited states will be denoted by @xmath84 with energies @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can find ground and excited states for @xmath86 included , but now they become in general @xmath10-dependent , @xmath87 with energy @xmath88 and @xmath89 with energy @xmath90 . for a given @xmath10 all such states </S>",
    "<S> are orthonormal and form a complete basis , but states for _ different _ @xmath10 are not necessarily orthonormal .    </S>",
    "<S> the full eigenproblem reads @xmath91 , where the _ zero order _ </S>",
    "<S> state is @xmath82 with energy @xmath63 . since @xmath41 is small , all states @xmath87 will also reduce to @xmath82 in zero order . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we can write an ansatz for @xmath92 in the form @xmath93 , where the latter sum is of higher order . plugging this form into the eigenproblem we get @xmath94 with @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> . sandwiching it with @xmath96 we get @xmath97 the factor @xmath98 is an analogue to the differential _ berry phase _ @xcite , which can be arbitrarily chosen . for our purpose , it is convenient to assume that it is zero . only _ relative _ berry phase for excited states would matter but only at high perturbation order . in the lowest order </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath99 the first two terms can be interpreted as adiabatic approximation @xcite , while the last one is a non - adiabatic correction to @xmath100 which is the main term we are here interested in . </S>",
    "<S> the next order term is a bit more technical and contains @xmath101 , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even higher terms get very complicated and very likely already obscured by other effects so there is no practical reason to discuss them .    </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath102 can be evaluated inserting identity between derivatives , @xmath103 since we assume zero differential ground berry phase , and from orthogonality between @xmath104 and @xmath105 we get @xmath106 the final form of the equation with lowest correction is @xmath107 here @xmath108 , with @xmath109 , is the ( dimensionless ) prefactor of the main correction to the josephson energy @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> as we consider the zero temperature case , in the ground state all single - particle states with _ negative _ energies are fully occupied while _ positive _ energies are fully empty . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant excited states ( for the terms @xmath110 ) are those with a _ single _ </S>",
    "<S> excitation , namely one state with positive energy gets fully occupied at the cost of full emptying one of the negative energy states see fig.[abslev ] . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly this term appears already in the normal case , and can be related to fermi edge singularity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are no more any infinities in higher order terms , and so this infinity has no physical relevance . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - dependent part is fortunately finite and equal @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> this is our main result . </S>",
    "<S> the use of canonical quantization is valid only if the correction to josephson energy is small , i.e. @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the intuition @xcite that the correction is small at phase variation @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) smaller than @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> remember that the quantum operation regime leads also to the condition @xmath136 or @xmath137 in the multichannel case . </S>",
    "<S> note also , that in the lowest order only @xmath54 appearing in josephson energy gets renormalized to @xmath138 ; there are no qualitative differences . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative change appears in higher order terms @xmath139 but also in the adiabatic ground energy @xmath88 , so the whole description gets anyway complicated @xcite . </S>",
