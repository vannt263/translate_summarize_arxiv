    "the significant progress in lattice qcd calculations , in particular , including dynamical quarks , strongly suggests that the deconfinement of hadronic matter and chiral symmetry restoration must happen at temperatures above @xmath4 mev  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of the properties of strongly interacting matter at high enough energy densities for a relatively long - lived quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to be formed is one of the goals of modern high energy physics ( see , for example , reviews in ref .",
    "it is expected that the quark - hadron phase transition , which likely occurred during the first few microseconds of the evolution of the universe , can be attained in heavy - ion accelerators .    in recent years",
    ", a great deal of attention has been devoted to `` hard '' probes of the qgp including heavy quarkonia , hard hadrons , jets , and high mass dimuons which are not part of the thermalized system , thus carrying information about the early stages of the evolution . in particular , the predicted charmonium suppression by screening of bound @xmath5 pairs ( `` colour dipole '' ) in a plasma  @xcite or dynamical dissociation by semi - hard deconfined gluons  @xcite is one of the most promising signals of qgp formation .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed in the most central pb+pb collisions at cern - sps  @xcite : the anomalously small @xmath2 to drell - yan ratio , inconsistent with pre - resonance absorption in cold nuclear matter .",
    "although the interpretation of this phenomenon as a result of qgp formation is plausible , alternative explanations such as rescattering with comoving hadrons can not be fully dismissed  @xcite . for the heavier @xmath6 bound states ( the @xmath7 family ) , a similar suppression effect in qgp is expected at the higher temperatures which can be attained in heavy ion collisions at the lhc .",
    "along with quarkonium suppression one process of interest is the passage of coloured jets through dense matter .",
    "dijets are created at the very beginning of the collision process , @xmath8 @xmath9 , by the initial hard parton - parton scatterings .",
    "these hard partons pass through the dense matter formed by minijet production at longer time scales , @xmath10 @xmath9 , and interact strongly with the constituents of the medium .",
    "the inclusive cross section for hard jet production is negligible at the sps but increases rapidly with the collision energy .",
    "thus these jets will play an important role at rhic ( with au+au collisions at @xmath11 gev ) and lhc ( with pb+pb collisions at @xmath12 tev ) .",
    "the challenge is to determine the behaviour of coloured jets in dense matter  @xcite due to coherent medium - induced gluon radiation  @xcite and collisional energy loss due to elastic rescatterings  @xcite .",
    "since the jet rescattering intensity strongly increases with temperature , formation of a `` hot '' qgp at initial temperatures up to @xmath13 gev at lhc  @xcite should result in much larger parton energy loss compared to `` cold '' nuclear matter or a hadronic gas .",
    "the following signals of medium - induced energy loss have been identified as being observable in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions : + 1 ) the suppression of high-@xmath14 jet pairs  @xcite with a corresponding enhancement of the monojet - to - dijet ratio  @xcite .",

    "note that the alice experiment  @xcite will also study dilepton production in heavy ion collisions although with a different rapidity acceptance : @xmath28 for cms while @xmath29 and @xmath30 for alice .",
    "we believe that dimuon production in combination with high-@xmath14 jet production by gluon and light quark fragmentation can give important information about the medium - induced effects for both light and heavy partons in heavy ion collisions at the lhc .",
    "the high - mass dimuon spectra in pb+pb collisions at lhc has already been estimated in the cms acceptance  @xcite assuming a constant energy loss per unit length of @xmath31 gev@xmath32fm . in our paper",
    "we consider the dynamical evolution of heavy quark energy loss and rescattering as a function of energy density in an expanding `` hot '' gluon - dominated plasma .",
    "we also investigate , for the first time , these effects on secondary @xmath2 production from single @xmath3-meson decays .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we discussed the problem of medium - induced gluon radiation of massive quark for incoherent and coherent cases . a model for rescattering of a heavy quark in dense qcd - medium",

    "we first discuss the effects of the medium on gluon radiation from heavy quarks .",
    "we emphasize that the recent theoretical developments on medium - induced gluon radiation  @xcite are valid in the coherent domain only in the ultrarelativistic limit of the quark momenta .",
    "although some attempts have been made to calculate medium - induced heavy quark energy loss for quarks of mass @xmath34  @xcite , a full description of the coherent radiation from a massive object still does not exist .",
    "there are two extreme limits for energy loss by gluon radiation . in the low @xmath14 limit , @xmath35",
    ", medium - induced radiation should be suppressed by the mass , while the ultrarelativistic limit , @xmath36 , corresponds to the radiation spectrum of massless quarks .",
    "the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a factorization of the matrix elements into elastic scattering and gluon emission  @xcite where the multiplicity distribution of the radiated gluons can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the 4-momenta of the emitted and the exchanged gluon respectively and @xmath40}$ ] is the rapidity of emitted gluon relative to the initial quark momentum .",
    "it is valid in a limited @xmath41-region for small rapidities @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the coherent lpm effect is taken into account simply by including a formation time restriction via a step function  @xcite .",
    "however , for light quarks , it leads to a different dependence of the radiative energy loss on the initial quark energy @xmath44 than found in other , more recent works  @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "the main contribution to high - mass dimuon and secondary @xmath2 production is due to @xmath27-quarks with `` intermediate '' values of @xmath45 gev@xmath46 , expected to be rather close to the incoherent regime . in order to estimate the sensitivity of the dimuon spectra to medium - induced effects , we consider two extreme cases : ( i ) the `` minimum '' effect with collisional energy loss only and ( ii ) the `` maximum '' effect with collisional and radiative energy loss in the incoherent limit of independent emissions without taking into account the lpm coherent suppression of radiation ( i.e. @xmath47 and is independent of path length , @xmath48 ) . in the latter scenario we use the bethe - heitler cross section obtained in relativistic kinematics and derive the medium - induced radiative energy loss per unit length  @xcite as the integral over the gluon radiation spectrum @xmath49 } , \\\\   & & c_3 ( y ) = \\frac{9\\pi \\alpha_s^2 c_{ab}}{4 } \\left [ 1+(1-y)^2-y^2\\right ]    \\ln{\\frac{2\\left ( \\alpha_s^2 \\rho e y(1-y)\\right ) ^{1/4}}{\\mu_d } } ,   \\nonumber      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the effective mass of the emitted gluon at temperature @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the fraction of the initial quark energy carried by the emitted gluon , @xmath53 is the density of the medium and the debye screening mass squared , @xmath54 , regularizes the integrated parton rescattering cross section .",
    "we have developed a monte - carlo simulation of the mean free path of heavy quarks ( @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 gev ) in an expanding qgp formed in the nuclear overlap zone in pb+pb collisions .",
    "the details of the geometrical model of hard quark production and the quark passage through dense matter can be found in our recent work  @xcite . in general , the intensity of rescattering and energy loss are sensitive to the initial conditions ( energy density @xmath57 and formation time @xmath58 ) and space - time evolution of the medium , treated as a longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid .",
    "the partons are produced on a hyper - surface of equal proper times @xmath59  @xcite .",

    "it is interesting that the initial energy density , @xmath57 , in the dense zone depends on @xmath27 very slightly , @xmath106 , up to @xmath107 and decreases rapidly for @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the proper time of a jet to escape the dense zone averaged over all possible jet production vertices , @xmath109 , is found to decrease almost linearly with increasing impact parameter .",
    "this means that for impact parameters @xmath110 , where @xmath111 of the heavy quark pairs are produced  @xcite , the difference in rescattering intensity and the corresponding energy loss is determined mainly by the different path lengths rather than the initial energy density .",
    "the simulation of quark rescattering is halted if one of the following three conditions is fulfilled : + 1 ) a quark escapes from the dense zone , i.e. its path length becomes greater than the effective transverse spread of the matter from the production vertex to the escape point .",
    "the details of the geometrical calculations of these quantities at a given impact parameter can be found in ref .",
    "+ 2 ) the plasma cools down to @xmath112 mev .",
    "we thus neglect possible additional small contributions to the total energy loss due to re - interactions in the hadron gas .",
    "+ 3 ) a quark loses so much energy that its transverse momentum @xmath14 drops below the average transverse momentum of the  thermal \" constituents of the medium . in this case , such a quark is considered to be  thermalized \" and its momentum in the rest frame of the fluid is generated from the random  thermal \" distribution , @xmath113 , boosted to the center - of - mass of the nucleus - nucleus collision  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider dimuon production in the high invariant mass region , @xmath114 gev@xmath115 , where @xmath116 one of the main dimuon sources in this  resonance - free \" mass region is the semileptonic decays of open bottom and charm mesons .",
    "heavy quark pairs are produced at the very beginning of the nuclear collisions by hard gluon - gluon scatterings and propagate through the dense medium .",
    "they finally form @xmath3 and @xmath22 mesons by  capturing \" @xmath117 , @xmath118 or @xmath119 quarks during the hadronization stage .",
    "these mesons will decay with the average meson lifetimes @xmath120 @xmath121 m , @xmath122 @xmath121 m , @xmath123 @xmath121 m and @xmath124 @xmath121 m .",
    "we note that @xmath125 of @xmath3 mesons and @xmath126 of @xmath22 mesons decay to muons .",
    "about half of the muons from @xmath3 decays are produced through an intermediate @xmath22  @xcite and contribute to the softer part of the @xmath14-spectrum .",
    "there is also dimuon production from single @xmath3 decays : @xmath127 .",
    "the branching ratio for this channel is comparable to the yield from @xmath6 pair decay .",
    "however the muon pairs from single @xmath3 s are concentrated in the low - mass region , @xmath128 gev/@xmath129 , below our interest here .",
    "note that at lhc energies , there can be a significant contribution to heavy flavour production from gluon splittings , @xmath130 , in initial- or final - state shower evolution  @xcite .",
    "although the probability for a high-@xmath14 event to contain at least one @xmath6 or @xmath5 pair is fairly large , most of these quarks are carrying a small fraction of the total transverse momentum of the jet and dimuons produced in such a way are expected to be concentrated mainly in the low invariant mass region .",
    "nevertheless the additional contribution of `` showering '' heavy quarks can be important even in high dimuon mass domain , and this phenomenon is studied in our next work  @xcite .    the main correlated background is drell - yan production , @xmath131 . the uncorrelated part of the dimuon background , random decays of pions and kaons and muon pairs of mixed origin , is comparable with the signal from @xmath6-decays  @xcite but these random decays also appear in the like - sign dimuon mass spectra .",
    "thus such background can be estimated from the @xmath132 and @xmath133 event samples as @xmath134 and subtracted from the total @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the cross sections , @xmath135 , for heavy quark production in @xmath136 collisions at @xmath137 tev , the initial @xmath138 momentum spectra , and the @xmath3 and @xmath22 meson fragmentation have all been obtained using pythia@xmath139  @xcite with the default cteq2l parton distribution functions and including initial and final state radiation in vacuum which effectively simulates higher - order contributions to heavy quark production .",
    "the corresponding pb+pb cross section is obtained by multiplying @xmath135 by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions .",
    "the initial distribution of @xmath138 pairs over impact parameter @xmath27 can be written as  @xcite @xmath140 where the differential inelastic @xmath141 cross section is @xmath142\\ ] ] and the total inelastic non - diffractive nucleon - nucleon cross section is @xmath143 mb at @xmath144 tev . the standard wood - saxon nuclear overlap function is @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the nuclear thickness function with nucleon density distributions @xmath147",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also take into account the modification of the nucleon structure functions due to the initial state nuclear interactions such as gluon depletion , nuclear shadowing , using the phenomenological parameterization of eskola et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the initial @xmath148 invariant mass spectra from correlated @xmath149 , @xmath150 and drell - yan production in the cms acceptance , @xmath151 gev/@xmath152 and @xmath28 . the upper and lower histograms for each contribution show the results without and with nuclear shadowing respectively . in this kinematical region",
    "the influence of nuclear shadowing on heavy quarks is relatively small , giving an @xmath153 reduction in the open bottom and charm decays .",
    "drell - yan production is somewhat more affected , with an @xmath154 reduction , because quark shadowing is stronger than gluon shadowing at low @xmath155 in the eks model  @xcite .",
    "the total impact - parameter integrated rates are normalized to the expected number of pb+pb events during a two week lhc run , @xmath156 s , assuming luminosity @xmath157@xmath158s@xmath159  @xcite to that @xmath160    we see that the @xmath161 rates are greater than those from the other sources by a factor of at least 5 .",
    "thus we only consider dimuons from @xmath149 decays in the remainder of the discussion .",
    "moreover , the medium - induced charm quark energy loss can be significantly larger than the @xmath27-quark loss due to the mass difference , resulting in an additional suppression of the @xmath162 yield .",
    "drell - yan pairs are unaffected by medium - induced final state interactions .",
    "these dimuons are directly from the primary nuclear interaction vertex while the dimuons from @xmath3 and @xmath22 meson decays appear at secondary vertices some distance from the primary vertex .",
    "the path length between the primary vertex and secondary vertices are determined by the lifetime and @xmath163-factor of the mesons .",
    "this fact allows one cut to suppress the drell - yan rate by up to two orders of magnitude using the dimuon reconstruction algorithm based on the tracker information on secondary vertex position  @xcite .",
    "figure 2 presents the @xmath0 invariant mass spectra from @xmath149 decays without and with the medium - induced @xmath27-quark energy loss described in sections 2 and 3 , including nuclear shadowing . the initial dimuon rate in the mass range @xmath114",
    "gev/@xmath129 is @xmath164 events per two week run without energy loss or shadowing .",
    "the rate can be reduced by factor of @xmath165 due to rescattering and @xmath27-quark energy loss in the qgp .",
    "note that the rate integrated over all phase space is always conserved : the suppression in the rate appears only when kinematic cuts are specified .",
    "the dimuon suppression due to collisional loss is more pronounced at relatively lower invariant masses since the collisional energy loss is almost independent of the initial quark energy .",
    "the relative contribution of medium - induced gluon radiation to total energy loss grows with increasing @xmath166 because the radiative energy loss grows with increasing initial energy , @xmath167 in the incoherent limit used in our calculations , and thus contributes to the whole high - mass dimuon range , especially in the large invariant mass domain .",
    "the loss increases for high momentum quarks which contribute to the larger dimuon masses .",
    "let us mark that the obtained value of dimuon rate suppression factor for the scenario with collisional and radiative energy loss ( @xmath168 at @xmath169 gev ) is close to the result of paper  @xcite , where a constant energy loss per unit length of @xmath31 gev@xmath32fm has been assumed . however , there exist the qualitative difference between invariant mass dependence of the effect in two models",
    ". in the case of constant ( independent of energy ) loss of heavy quark the suppression factor in  @xcite decreases with increasing dimuon mass ( this is similar to our scenario with collisional loss only ) , while the @xmath170-dependence in our model is specified by the dominant mechanism of energy loss .    to conclude this section",
    ", we note that there are theoretical uncertainties in the bottom and charm production cross sections in nucleon - nucleon collisions at lhc energies which affect the quark production rates without any loss effects .",
    "the absolute dimuon rates depend on the parton distribution functions , the heavy quark mass , the @xmath3-meson fragmentation scheme , next - to - leading order corrections , etc .",
    "another possible contribution to the @xmath27 quark cross section could be light gluinos decaying into @xmath27 squarks  @xcite , as proposed to explain the apparent deficit in the @xmath3 cross section at the tevatron .",
    "it is therefore desirable that high mass dimuon measurements in @xmath171 or @xmath172 collisions are made at the same or similar energy per nucleon as in the heavy ion runs .",
    "we now consider another process which can also carry information about medium - induced rescattering and @xmath27-quark energy loss : secondary @xmath2 production .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath174 is @xmath175 .",
    "the @xmath2 s subsequently decay to dimuons with a @xmath176 branching ratio  @xcite so that e.g. @xmath177    figure 3 shows the transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity distributions of secondary @xmath2 decays for the same nuclear shadowing and energy loss scenarios described in the previous section .",
    "the total rates are again normalized to the expected number of events in a two week pb+pb run .",
    "we expect @xmath178 dimuons from secondary @xmath2 s at @xmath179 gev/@xmath129 . including nuclear shadowing reduces this @xmath2 yield by @xmath180 while the final state rescattering and energy loss by @xmath27-quarks can further reduce the @xmath2 rates by a factor of @xmath181 in the cms acceptance .",
    "we see that the influence of nuclear effects on secondary @xmath2 production and high - mass dimuon rates are quite different .",
    "the 25% decrease of the secondary @xmath2 rate by nuclear shadowing is comparable to the @xmath182 effect of medium - induced final state interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - mass dimuon rates are reduced by up to a factor of @xmath183 due to energy loss , much larger than the @xmath184 nuclear shadowing correction . the increased sensitivity to nuclear shadowing",
    "is due to the different @xmath155 and @xmath185 regions probed .",
    "the different influence of energy loss on secondary @xmath2 and high - mass dimuons is because secondary @xmath2 s come from the decay of a single @xmath27 quark instead of a @xmath6 pair and there is a non - negligible probability that the energy lost by one quark is small .",
    "thus a comparison between high - mass dimuon and secondary @xmath2 production could clarify the nature of energy loss .",
    "we note that about 5000 primary @xmath186 in a two week pb+pb run are expected to be initially produced by gluon - gluon fusion at cms acceptance .",
    "the final primary @xmath2 rate is rather uncertain : on one hand , it should be suppressed due to colour screening  @xcite and/or dynamical dissociation in a qgp  @xcite ; on the other hand ,  thermal \" models predict some additional yield of @xmath2 s from a qgp , see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "other models suggest that@xmath2 s can be regenerated in the hadron phase by @xmath187 interactions @xcite .",
    "note that we call all these @xmath2 s  primary \" in the sense that they are from the primary nuclear interaction vertex .",
    "although they could be produced late in the collision , either after thermalization or in the hadronization stages , the time scale of their formation is much less than the formation time of secondary @xmath2 s from @xmath3 meson decays .",
    "thus it is necessary to distinguish secondary from primary @xmath2 s . as in the case of separating dimuons from drell - yan production and @xmath6 decays",
    ", primary @xmath2 s produced at the nuclear interaction point can be rejected using tracker information on the secondary vertex position .",
    "in addition , primary @xmath2 s have a softer dimuon @xmath14 spectrum than secondary @xmath2 s and the primary @xmath2 contribution disappears rapidly with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the sensitivity of spectra of high - mass @xmath0 pairs from @xmath6 decays and dimuons from secondary @xmath2 s to medium - induced bottom quark energy loss in pb+pb collisions at lhc . for certainty",
    "the cms experiment kinematical acceptance has been considered . since",
    "a complete description of coherent radiation by massive quarks is still lacking , the dimuon spectra were calculated for two extreme cases : with collisional loss only , the  minimum \" effect , and with collisional and radiative loss estimated in the incoherent limit , the  maximum \" effect .",
    "we have found that medium - induced parton rescattering and energy loss can reduce the dimuon rate in the invariant mass range @xmath114 gev/@xmath129 by a factor from @xmath188 to @xmath183 while nuclear shadowing is only of order of @xmath184 in our kinematical region .",
    "the relative contribution of radiative energy loss to the total dimuon suppression grows with increasing invariant mass and @xmath14 due to the stronger energy dependence of radiative loss relative to collisional loss .    since secondary @xmath2 production reflects the medium - induced energy loss of only one @xmath27-quark , the corresponding suppression by a factor of @xmath189 is less than for @xmath6 decays . on the other hand",
    ", the influence of nuclear shadowing on the relatively low invariant mass region , @xmath190 , seems to be non - negligible .",
    "we suggest that comparing high - mass dimuons with secondary @xmath2 production would help clarify the nature of this phenomenon .",
    "the experimental recognition of high - mass dimuons from @xmath6 decays relative to drell - yan pairs , as well as the recognition of secondary compared to primary @xmath2 s , could be performed using tracker information on the secondary vertex position .",
    "we conclude that the dimuon spectra will be sensitive to final state rescattering and energy loss of bottom quarks in dense matter .",
    "however , there are still theoretical uncertainties in the initial production of heavy flavours in nucleon - nucleon collisions at lhc energies .",
    "thus measurements in @xmath171 or @xmath172 collisions at the same or similar energies per nucleon as in the heavy ion runs are required .",
