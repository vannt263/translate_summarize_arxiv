    "in the last three decades spin - glasses have attracted the attention of experimentalists and theoreticians as glassy prototypical systems showing _ frustration and quenched disorder _",
    "shortly , spin - glasses are systems with localized electronic magnetic moments whose interactions are characterized by quenched randomness : a given pair of spins have a roughly equal _ a priori _ probability of having a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the prototype material is a dilute magnetic alloy , with a small amount of magnetic impurity randomly substituted into the lattice of a nonmagnetic metallic host . in this situation",
    ", the impossibility to minimize simultaneously the interaction energies of all the couple of spins leads to a frustration which determines a very complex energetic landscape in phase space .",
    "the latter appears as consisting of large valleys separated by high activation energies .",
    "each valley contains many local minima in which the system , at low temperature , can remain trapped for a very long time .",
    "this time grows exponentially with the height of the energy barriers , thus the system shows very slow relaxation , strong memory effects and aging .",
    "+ the modern theory of spin glasses @xcite began in 1975 with the work of edwards and anderson ( ea ) @xcite , who proposed that the essential physics of spin glasses lays not in the details of their microscopic interactions but rather in the _ competition _ between quenched ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions ( i.e. in the frustration ) .",
    "thus they proposed a short range simplified model for spin - glasses , in which one represents the magnetic impurities with ising spins @xmath1 placed on the vertices of a three dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the random nature of the interactions are mimicked with first neighbors random interactions between the spins taken from a gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the connectivity of the lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian ( in the absence of an external magnetic field ) is @xmath4 = - \\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } j_{ij } s_i s_j \\ ; , \\label{3dea - hamil}\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath5 encodes the full set of spins in the sample @xmath6 and @xmath7 represents nearest neighbors on the lattice . shortly after the appearance of the ea model ,",
    "an infinite - ranged version was proposed by sherrington and kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite . for a system of @xmath0 ising spins , and in zero external field ,",
    "the sk hamiltonian is @xmath4 = - { 1\\over\\sqrt{n } } \\sum_{(i , j ) } j_{ij } s_i s_j    \\ ; , \\label{sk - hamil}\\ ] ] with a gaussian distribution of interactions .",
    "notice that in eq.[sk - hamil ] the sum runs over all pair of spins and the factor @xmath8 allows to consider the thermodynamic limit for the free energy and for other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "in ref.@xcite sk showed that their model has an equilibrium phase transition to a spin - glass phase below the temperature @xmath9 and for an opportune choice of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively mean and standard deviation of the gaussian distribution of interactions .",
    "+ a mean field theory , employing the onsager reaction field term , was proposed two years later by thouless , anderson , and palmer @xcite , which indicated that there might be many low - temperature solutions corresponding to different spin - glass phases .",
    "but the correct solution for the low - temperature phase of the sk model , due to parisi @xcite , employed a novel _ ansatz _ and required several more years before a physical interpretation could be worked out @xcite .",
    "the picture that finally arose was that of a system with an extraordinary new kind of symmetry breaking , known today as `` replica symmetry breaking '' , or rsb , after the mathematical procedures used to derive it .",
    "the essential idea is that the low - temperature phase consists not of a single spin - reversed pair of states , but rather of `` infinitely many pure thermodynamic states '' @xcite , not related by any simple symmetry transformation .",
    "+ within the original mean - field framework of the sk model it is possible to observe three different phases , namely , paramagnetic ( pa ) , ferromagnetic ( fe ) and spin glass ( sg ) phase , depending on the temperature and the parameters of the gaussian distribution of the interactions @xcite .",
    "each phase is characterized by a different microscopic behavior and a different kind of orientation order , giving rise to a characteristic value of the usual mean field order parameter , i.e. the magnetization @xmath12 .",
    "thus it is clear that the magnetization , calculated at one instant of time , vanishes in the sg phase just like in the pa one .",
    "therefore , in order to discriminate between spin glass disorder and paramagnetism , one needs an additional order parameter .",
    "such a parameter was originally proposed in refs .",
    "it is called _ edwards - anderson ( ea ) order parameter _ and takes into account the temporal evolution of each spin . in this way",
    "the latter is able to measure the degree of freezing of the system and to distinguish between the pa phase , where it vanishes together with the magnetization , and the sg phase , where it remains finite .",
    "actually , in its original formulation , the ea order parameter results to be only an approximation ( the so - called _ replica symmetry approximation _ ) of the true spin - glass order parameter proposed by parisi @xcite , that has to be defined in the replica space and results to be a whole function ( see also refs.@xcite for more details ) .",
    "however , we will show that also considering the approximated sk point of view it is possible to shed new light on the already suggested link between glassy dynamics and the anomalous out - of - equilibrium behavior of the quasi stationary states of the hmf model .",
    "the hmf model describes a system of @xmath0 fully - coupled classical inertial xy spins with unitary module @xcite @xmath13 for a better visualization these spins can also be imagined as particles rotating on a unit circle .",
    "the equations of motion follow from the hamiltonian @xmath14~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the angle and @xmath17 the conjugate variable representing the rotational velocity of spin @xmath18 .",
    "+ the equilibrium solution of the model in the canonical ensemble predicts a second order phase transition from a high temperature paramagnetic ( pa ) phase to a low temperature ferromagnetic ( fe ) one @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature is @xmath19 and corresponds to a critical energy per particle @xmath20 .",
    "the order parameter of this phase transition is the modulus of the _ average magnetization _ per spin defined as : @xmath21 . above @xmath22 , in the pa phase , the spins point in different directions and @xmath23 .",
    "below @xmath22 , in the fe phase , all the spins are aligned ( the rotators are trapped in a single cluster ) and @xmath24 .     in this figure we plot - for n=100000 - the molecular dynamics numerical results corresponding to qss ( open squares ) , compared with both the canonical caloric curve , plotted as solid line , and the zero magnetization ( or minimum temperature ) line , reported as dot - dashed .",
    "the temperature is calculated by means of the average kinetic energy k , i.e .",
    "the qss follows the latter line only up to @xmath26 , becoming unstable below this limiting value @xcite.,width=307 ]    however , as already pointed out in the introduction , molecular dynamics simulations , at fixed energy and for out - of - equilibrium initial conditions , show the presence of long - living quasi - stationary states ( qss ) in the subcritical energy density region @xmath27 ( @xcite ) . in the _ thermodynamic limit _ - when they become stationary and",
    "reach a limiting temperature value @xmath28 - the qss can be usefully divided in two subset of states , depending on their magnetization : + - _ @xmath29 qss _ ( for @xmath30 ) , i.e. anomalous states lieing , for @xmath31 , over the extension of the high temperature branch of the caloric curve ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) and showing a vanishing magnetization ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that , because of the energy density - temperature relationship ( @xcite ) : @xmath32 the zero magnetization constraint forces the system to follow the minimum kinetic energy ( maximum potential energy ) line , i.e. the minimum temperature line ( dot - dashed in fig.[fig1 ] ) ; + - _ @xmath33 qss _ ( for @xmath34 ) , i.e. anomalous states with a macroscopic magnetization ( @xmath33 ) , which for @xmath31 tend to rejoin the canonical equilibrium curve .",
    "+ it has also been shown @xcite that the _ m=0 qss _ family is unstable below the limiting energy density value @xmath35 , corresponding to a temperature @xmath36 , around which the anomalies are more evident ( this is also the reason why , historically , the qss analysis focused on the value @xmath37 ) .",
    "below such a value the qss can not follow the zero magnetization ( minimum temperature ) line and the dynamical anomalies start to decrease until they completely disappear below @xmath38 . + actually , it was just the vanishing magnetization of the _ m=0 qss _ and the discovery of aging  @xcite and of _ dynamical frustration _",
    "@xcite , i.e. the formation of clusters of particles with power - law size distributions @xcite that suggested the interpretation of such a regime in terms of a sort of spin - glass phase characterized by an ea - like order parameter @xcite .",
    "+ during the qss regime , the mean - field interaction seems to be broken : in fact , the clusters that compete in trapping the particles on the unitary circle , generate a dynamically frustrated scenario , in wich each particle never feels all the other particles , but only a restricted number of them .",
    "this feature seems to indicate , for finite sizes of the system , a corrugated potential landscape for the single particle .",
    "this effect is very sensitive to the initial conditions @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit ( when the qss become stationary )",
    ", the force between the particles - which depends on m - vanishes and the dynamics is quenched ( apart from the global motion imposed by the conservation of total momentum ) .",
    "+ therefore , inspired by the physical meaning of the ea order parameter , we proposed @xcite a new order parameter for the hmf model , the so - called _ polarization _ , in order to measure the degree of freezing of the particles ( rotators ) in the qss regime and , thus , to characterize in a quantitative way the emerging glassy - like dynamical frustration .",
    "+ polarization is defined as the following spatial average @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the _ elementary polarization _ , defined as the temporal average , integrated over an opportune time interval @xmath41 , of the successive positions of each rotator . + for the typical energy density value @xmath37 ( corresponding to a limiting temperature @xmath42 ) , we showed that , while the magnetization correctly vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , the polarization remains approximatively constant and different from zero , thus quantifying the freezing of the rotators in the qss regime . on the other hand , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath43 the polarization coincides with the magnetization and goes to zero .",
    "+ in other words , the polarization seems to play here the same role played by the edwards - anderson @xcite order parameter @xmath44 in the sk model , thus characterizing the anomalous qss regime , which becomes stable in the thermodynamic limit , as a sort of _ spin - glass phase _ for the hmf model .    in fig.[fig2 ] , extending the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath37 , we plot , as open circles , the values of the polarization order parameter for the range @xmath45 , where the _",
    "m=0 qss _ family result to be stable .",
    "these points , reported for convenience as a function of the corresponding @xmath31 limiting temperature @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) were obtained by means of the usual microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations for @xmath48 .",
    "the standard `` water - bag '' initial conditions with initial magnetization @xmath49 ( all the angles equal and velocities uniformly distributed according to the available kinetic energy ) were considered . as usual , the integration time @xmath41 ( @xmath50 ) has been chosen in order to stay inside the qss plateaux for every @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an average over 25 events was also performed .",
    "the error bars represent the fluctuations of the elementary polarization over the configuration of the @xmath0 rotators . as previously seen for @xmath37 @xcite , increasing the size of the system the average polarization remains almost constant inside this error along the qss plateaux . please note that for @xmath51 the system is in the so - called _ translational regime _ and its center of mass drifts @xcite , i.e. the system is always moving with a global resulting motion that can be expressed by the phase of the average magnetization .",
    "then , as done in the previous calculations @xcite , in order to compute the elementary polarization , one has to subtract this phase from the spin angles .",
    "as expected , the polarization correctly decreases approaching the phase transition , after which , in the homogeneous phase ( not shown ) , it vanishes - together with the magnetization - in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "+ in the following sections we give further support to the claim that the glassy - like behavior characterizing the qss regime corresponds to a 2-vector sk spin - glass phase by means of a replica method formalism applied to an appropriately chosen hamiltonian .",
    "microcanonical simulations for the polarization , eq.(6 ) , performed in the qss regime of the hmf model ( open circles ) , are compared with the solution of the self - consistent equation for the spin - glass order parameter @xmath52 ( full line ) eq.([p_equat ] ) .",
    "both these quantities are plotted versus the limiting temperature @xmath46 . in the inset ,",
    "a plot of the caloric curve and the qss points for the hmf model is reported for comparison .",
    "the spin - glass phase region has been framed.,width=307 ]",
    "* it must take into account the presence of the dynamically created clusters of particles observed in the qss regime , which in turn generate dynamical frustration ; * its first moment @xmath77 should be equal to @xmath78 ( being in the hmf model @xmath79 ) ; in such a way , for @xmath31 , eq.([hj ] ) will reduce to the potential term of the hmf model .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can choose a gaussian distribution : @xmath80^{-1}~exp\\frac{-(j_{ij}-j_0)^2}{2j^2}~~ \\label{jdistr}\\ ] ] where the first two moments , the mean @xmath77 and the variance @xmath81 , will be set equal to @xmath78 .",
    "+ finally , the inverse temperature @xmath82 will be fixed by the kinetic term of the hmf model hamiltonian ( being @xmath25 ) , that we assume to be constant for the canonical procedure we want to perform .",
    "of course we are implicitly assuming that the stationarity of the _ m=0 qss _ regime in the thermodynamic limit could enable us to use equilibrium thermodynamics tools .",
    "+ for fixed j s we expect that the replica method would enable us to find out a self - consistent equation for the spin - glass order parameter of the model ( [ hj ] ) . this equation will be obtained using the replica - symmetry ( rs ) ansatz in the context of a 2-vector infinite range spin - glass model @xcite , by imposing the spin - glass extremal constraints during the steepest descent procedure .",
    "our final goal will be to compare such a theoretical prediction with the molecular dynamics results for the polarization of eq.([pol ] ) , in a range of temperatures corresponding with the @xmath83 limiting temperatures ( @xmath46 ) that characterize the homogeneous quasi - stationary states .",
    "+ let us start by applying the replica trick to the free energy calculation starting from the effective hamiltonian ( [ hj ] ) , with quenched couplings @xmath73 following the distribution ( [ jdistr ] ) .",
    "+ using some general properties of the characteristic function of a statistical distribution , and averaging eq.([zn2 ] ) over the chosen distribution of the @xmath73 , we can write the free energy density expression ( [ free_en_new ] ) as a function of only the first two moments of the distribution itself @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 are replica indexes and @xmath88 are spin indexes in each replica .",
    "thus @xmath89 represents the @xmath18th spin in the @xmath65th replica .",
    "as seen before , both the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath81 , respectively mean and variance of the j s distribution ( [ jdistr ] ) , have to be put equal to @xmath78 .",
    "finally , the notation @xmath90 in the sum is equivalent to a sum over all @xmath91 distinct pairs of sites , thus the factor @xmath92 disappears behind the sum over @xmath88 .",
    "+ because of the latter notation , and after some rearrangment , we can write the following equivalences @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 } \\label{ss1}\\ ] ] where two terms of interference between replicas appear @xmath97 and @xmath98 the latter term , for @xmath99 , becomes @xmath100 .",
    "+ after further rearrangment in the summations , we obtain the following expression for the free energy density @xmath101\\ ] ] @xmath102 @xmath103 -1 \\}~~.\\ ] ] @xmath104 in the thermodynamic limit , the first exponential becomes @xmath105 \\approx \\exp~[\\frac{nn \\beta^2}{8}]\\ ] ] and it does not involve the glassy properties of the system . therefore in the following we will concentrate on the term @xmath106",
    "@xmath103 ~~.\\ ] ] @xmath107 it can be linearized , term by term , with the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) gaussian transformation , i.e. @xmath108}(2\\pi)^{-1/2 } \\int dy \\exp{[- \\frac{{y}^2}{2 } + ( 2 \\mu)^{1/2}xy~]}~~ , \\label{hs1}\\ ] ] with the positions @xmath109 @xmath110 thus obtaining @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114~ \\}~~.\\ ] ] the mean field approximation consists on saying that one can deal with independent spins feeling the external conjugated fields @xmath115 so that this last relation becomes @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119^n \\label{free_en_3}\\ ] ] where from now on the trace is over the @xmath67 replicas at a single site ( mean field approximation ) .",
    "at this point we have to impose the following spin - glass constraints @xcite , based on the physical meaning of the two order parameters in the _ m=0 qss _ regime ( that we are considering as an effective spin - glass phase of the hmf model ) :    1 .",
    "the first one refers to the @xmath120 , that is null in the _",
    "m=0 qss _ regime , thus implying @xmath121 2 .",
    "the second one refers to the _ spin - glass order parameter _ , which of course does not vanish in the spin - glass phase thus quantifying the degree of freezing of the rotators in the _",
    "m=0 qss _ regime ; as usual in standard replica method for glassy systems , it is chosen as proportional to the module of the @xmath122 between two different replicas at a single site @xmath123 where the @xmath124 are considered equals @xmath125 ( replica - symmetry approximation ) .",
    "the phase of @xmath126 , being arbitrary , can be set to zero for convenience so that its direction is @xmath127 .",
    "finally , we set also @xmath128 .",
    "solving numerically this equation , we can immediately calculate the expected value of the spin - glass order parameter @xmath52 as a function of the temperature @xmath148 and compare it with the polarization order parameter @xmath149 of the hmf model .",
    "in particular , since we have to consider _",
    "m=0 qss _ with null magnetization , we consider the limiting temperature @xmath46 ( i.e. the temperature for @xmath150 ) and , by varying it in eq.([p_equat ] ) , we obtain the theoretical curve shown in fig.[fig2 ] ( full line ) .",
    "this curve is compared with the molecular dynamics simulations for the polarization ( open circles ) performed in the qss regime of the hmf model for n=1000 and for different temperatures in the subcritical region .",
    "some corresponding energy density values are also reported for convenience .",
    "as previously stressed , these results are independent on n within the error bars @xcite and this allow us to extrapolate them to the thermodynamic limit . + the theoretical curve predicts , as expected , a phase transition at @xmath151 and superimposes on the values of the polarization obtained in the range @xmath152 , that corresponds ( being there @xmath153 ) to the energy density range @xmath154 through the zero magnetization ( minimum temperature ) line equation @xmath155 , see eq.([caloric ] ) .",
    "the simulations points start to disagree with the results of the theoretical curve around @xmath156 , i.e. for @xmath157 : above these values the qss points are very close to the correspondent equilibrium temperature values on the caloric curve ( as visible in the inset of fig.[fig2 ] ) and the glassy features of the qss regime tend to disappear . inverting the previous argument , we could also suggest that such a theoretical result allows us to better specify the range of energy densities where the qss regime can be considered as a spin - glass phase for the hmf model .",
    "we have discussed the glassy phase of the hmf model by means of an effective spin - glass hamiltonian and shown that the corresponding order parameter coincides with the polarization in the energy range where hmf exhibits strong dynamical anomalies and glassy dynamics .",
    "being a long - range hamiltonian solvable model and showing the existence of a glassy - like relaxation dynamics along quasi - stationary trajectories , the hmf model poses new challenging questions on the origin of its glassy unexpected behavior . in these respects ,",
    "the model may be a very useful `` laboratory '' for studying general trends that can be later tested numerically and experimentally in more realistic systems and real materials .",
    "+ these analytical results , obtained within the replica - symmetry sk framework and in the thermodynamic limit , seem to give further support to the interpretation of the qss regime as a real spin - glass phase .",
    "this is true at least in the limiting temperature region where the glassy features are more evident . in this region",
    "the elementary polarization seems to play the role of the ea order parameter in giving a measure of the numerically observed quenched dynamics .",
    "+ in conclusion , we do hope that this connection between the hmf model and spin - glass systems could bring new insight on the several common features .",
