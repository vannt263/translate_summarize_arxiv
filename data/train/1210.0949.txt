    "the solar magnetic field is thought to be generated by dynamo action @xcite . in most solar dynamo models differential rotation",
    "is the key process that generates strong toroidal field near the base of the convection zone . .",
    "the mean energy density of dynamo - generated magnetic field is determined by the energy density of differential rotation as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denote the strength of magnetic field , density and typical difference of the fluid velocity at the tachocline . at the tachocline these values are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radius at the tachocline and the difference of angular velocity between the top and the bottom of the tachocline , respectively .",
    "in addition , if we assume a linear velocity profile and formally integrate that over the width of the shear layer , we have a drop by another factor of 3 in energy . using these values the dynamo - generated magnetic field",
    "is estimated to be approximately @xmath8 .",
    "this estimate is similar to the values found in mean - field models with lorentz force feedback by @xcite .",
    "note that in @xcite latitudinal shear mostly generates toroidal magnetic field and that differential rotation is continuously replenished through the @xmath9-effect ( parameterized turbulent angular momentum transport ) , which explains why @xmath10 g can be reached with only small feedback on differential rotation .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical studies of flux emergence and their comparison with observed sunspot properties ( joy s law , low latitude emergence ) imply substantially stronger field near the base of the convection zone .",
    "@xcite suggest that a toroidal field strength of about 50 kg is required at the base of the convection zone in order to reproduce the statistical properties of tilted sunspot pairs in rising flux tube simulations ( see also review by * ? ? ?",
    "above results suggest that additional mechanisms for the amplification other than rotational shear are required .",
    "one candidate of such a mechanism is the `` explosion '' of rising magnetic flux tubes .",
    "it is summarized as follows : suppose that there is a superadiabatically stratified atmosphere like the solar convection zone and a dynamo - generated toroidal magnetic field . when the gravity has the profile of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the radius , the distribution of gas pressure @xmath13 is expressed as @xmath14^{1/\\nabla},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using a constant temperature gradient as @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the gas pressure and the pressure scale height at @xmath18 , respectively , where @xmath19 is the location of the base of the convection zone .",
    "as the toroidal field buoyantly rises as a flux tube , the thermal property in the tube vary adiabatically while the surrounding gas in the convection zone is stratified in a superadiabatic manner .",
    "the thermal exchange is mainly by radiative diffusion in the solar convection zone and the time scale of it is at least several tens of years for a @xmath20 flux sheet , which is much longer than the time scale of flux emergence on the order of months .",
    "therefore the internal distribution of the gas pressure is expressed as : @xmath21^{1/\\nabla_\\mathrm{ad}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the adiabatic temperature gradient .",
    "we note that @xmath23 and the pressure of the internal medium of magnetic flux decreases slower with @xmath12 than that of the external medium .",
    "suppose that the pressure is in balance at the base of convection zone as : @xmath24 as the decrease of the pressure in the tube is slower than that of the surrounding plasma , these pressures become the same at a certain height @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "this height is called the explosion height . even after passing the explosion height",
    ", the flux tube continues to rise up to the surface of the sun @xmath27 . during this process ,",
    "mass in the flux tube is swept out due to the imbalance between the pressure gradient and the gravitational force along the magnetic field ( see fig . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "we specify the gas pressure distribution @xmath28 , after this sweeping of mass .",
    "since the gas pressure is balanced at the surface , i.e. @xmath29 , the pressure distribution is expressed as : @xmath30^{1/\\nabla_\\mathrm{ad}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a subscript `` t '' denotes the value at the surface . if both ends of the the rising flux tube stay at the initial position ( @xmath18 ) , the amplified magnetic field has the energy density of @xmath31 since the pressure is in balance at the surface with the amplified field , the magnetic field is amplified up to the strength for which the explosion height approaches the surface .",
    "the asymptotic field strength is independent of the initial magnetic field and given by the superadiabaticity of the convection zone .",
    "@xcite investigate explosion using one - dimensional thin flux tube approximation .",
    "@xcite show using two - dimensional mhd calculation that magnetic field can be amplified up to @xmath32 in the solar convection zone .",
    "the time scale of amplification is determined by the initial magnetic field and is @xmath33 when the initial plasma beta is @xmath34 .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the possibility of an explosion of a magnetic flux and its consequential intensification by mhd simulations in three - dimensions , i.e. in more realistic situations , which have not yet been investigated in previous studies .",

    "@xmath63 is a free parameter from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "as shown above , we are considering a toroidal flux sheet as a source of the magnetic flux prior to the intensification because the magnetic field stretched by the @xmath72-effect at the bottom of the convection zone is suggested to have a sheet structure according to @xcite .",
    "then @xmath73 is calculated to satisfy the divergence free condition , i.e. @xmath74 with @xmath75 at the all boundaries and @xmath76 in all the domain .    in order to mimic the situation of the solar convection zone",
    ", we adopt a similar approach as @xcite . the upper layer ( @xmath77 )",
    "is adiabatically stratified ( convection zone : @xmath78 ) and the lower layer ( @xmath79 ) is subadiabatically stratified ( radiative zone : @xmath80 ) , where @xmath81 is the superadiabaticity .",
    "the magnetic layer is placed at the interface between both regions . since our convection zone",
    "is adiabatically stratified we add additional entropy within the flux sheet to allow for a buoyant rise and subsequent explosion . using this setting , the pressure scale height in the flux sheet is longer than that of the external medium and the explosion occurs around @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the added entropy .",
    "using an adiabatic stratification in the upper layer allows us to study the explosion process in a relatively simple situation without thermal convection ; this leads , however , also to limitations since some key processes are not catured in our setup . beside not capturing the influence from convection",
    ", our magnetic flux sheet is not stored in stable layer having neutral magnetic buoyancy , i.e. overshoot region at the base of the solar convection zone .",
    "the flux sheet is however stabilized against buoyancy to some degree by lying on top of our stably stratified lower layer .",
    "we will investigate the explosion process in a superadiabatic convection zone with fully developed thermal convection in a future study .",
    "the initial conditions for pressure and density are derived from solving the equations : @xmath84\\label{entropy_grad},\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial p_\\mathrm{tot}}{\\partial z } = -\\rho g,\\\\ & & p_\\mathrm{tot } = p + \\frac{b^2}{8\\pi},\\\\ & & \\rho = \\left[\\frac{p}{\\exp(s / c_\\mathrm{v})}\\right]^{1/\\gamma}\\label{density_trans}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we specify @xmath85 . using this parameter the explosion height is around @xmath86 .",
    "we do not yet aim at a realistic simulation with solar parameters but rather consider a model that allows us to study the explosion and the following intensification in ( artificial ) isolation .",
    "if there is a superadibatically stratified convection zone , turbulent thermal convection is generated and the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "in this study , we take the @xmath37-component of the perturbation on the initial magnetic field ( @xmath63 ) as a free parameter . fig .",
    "[ 3d ] shows the strength and the field lines of the magnetic field for simulations with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we present here only the solutions in the center region cut at @xmath89 to enhance the clarity of the presentation .",
    "the magnetic layer fills in the horizontal directions the whole domain outlined by the white lines . in our three - dimensional situation a value of @xmath88 ( fig . [ 3d]d ) leads to a substantial intensification of magnetic field , which is similar to the two - dimensional calculation reported by @xcite . at the foot - points",
    "the magnetic field lines remain almost parallel to the @xmath36-axis for @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplification of magnetic field is significantly less with @xmath87 . in the result with @xmath87 ,",
    "the foot - point magnetic field rises upward and the magnetic field lines at the back ( @xmath90 ) are bent to the center ( @xmath91 ) of the calculation domain . at this stage , it is suggested that the intensification of magnetic field by explosion process is more likely to occur with a longer perturbation , which is perpendicular to the main magnetic field .",
    "[ meanb]a shows the temporal evolution of magnetic energy averaged over the @xmath89 plane . around @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the speed of sound at @xmath57 , the initial intensification of magnetic field with explosion process",
    "is completed in all cases , i.e. the top of the rising flux is reaching the upper boundary .",
    "[ meanb]b shows the dependence on @xmath63 of the mean magnetic energy at @xmath92 .",
    "it is qualitatively clear that a larger scale @xmath63 causes a more effective intensification .    in the following discussion , we compare the results with different @xmath63 at the time when the apex of the rising magnetic flux sheet reaches @xmath94 in each case . fig .",

    "fig [ meanb]d shows the dependence of the maximum value of the averaged @xmath37-component fluid velocity .",
    "the flow parallel to the @xmath37-axis is generated by a pressure gradient @xmath97 : as the magnetic flux rises , the gas pressure in the central region decreases and it causes a converging flow in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "the amplitude of the fluid velocity is estimated as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 denotes the perturbations of the gas pressure with respect to the ambient medium and @xmath100 the time intervall over which the acceleration takes place . for our estimate",
    "we use values of @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , the difference of the pressure is estimated to be @xmath103 which is the same order of @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the density and pressure at @xmath57 .",

    "[ meanb]d corresponds to this equation .",
    "overall the result with @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath71 are well reproduced .",
    "the result with @xmath87 is slightly smaller than the value estimated from @xmath110 .",
    "the reason is that the center region is already filled with mass , resulting in a smaller @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , a small value of @xmath100 with @xmath87 causes the deviation .",
    "[ tilt]a shows the value of @xmath111 along the field lines , where @xmath111 is the fluid velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field in the @xmath36-@xmath38 plane .",
    "a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath111 indicates a flow which moves the magnetic flux upward ( downward ) .",
    "using small ( large ) @xmath63 , the foot - point magnetic flux move upward ( downward ) . fig [ tilt]b shows the velocity parallel to the magnetic field along magnetic field lines .",
    "the larger velocity is generated with larger @xmath63 .",
    "these correspond to the amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "our results show that the efficiency of the magnetic intensification is dependent on the spatial scale of the perturbations ( @xmath63 ) . the reason is understood as follows : in a two - dimensional situation @xcite or using large value of @xmath112 , the pressure gradient @xmath113 leads to strong converging flows toward the center of the rising flux sheet within the @xmath89-plane .",
    "the flow component parallel to the field leads to amplification , the flow component perpendicular to the field prevents the buoyant motion around the legs of the rising flux and consequently plays a role for pinning down the foot - points ( fig .",
    "[ schema]a ) . on the other hand , using small @xmath114 , a converging motion in the @xmath37-direction",
    "is promoted by the large pressure gradient @xmath97 and the center of the explosion region is filled with the mass .",
    "thus the pressure around the foot - point becomes large and the flow @xmath115 is suppressed .",
    "consequently magnetic flux moves upward and is less amplified ( fig . [ schema]b ) .",
    "if the foot - point magnetic field is fixed at the initial position , the amplification of magnetic energy is estimated with eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) . in a three - dimensional situation , however there is a possibility that the foot - point magnetic flux moves upward , thus the amplified magnetic energy is estimated using eq . ( [ amp ] ) at @xmath116 instead of @xmath18 , where @xmath117 denotes the location of the foot - point magnetic flux . fig .",
    "[ anal ] shows the dependence of the amplified magnetic energy by the explosion process on the location of foot - point with the parameters of our calculation .",
    "if the foot - point magnetic field is fixed in the initial position , the magnetic energy of @xmath118 can be generated by the explosion process .",
    "the result with large @xmath119 well reproduces this estimation ( see fig . [ 3d]d ) . note that fig .",
    "[ meanb]a shows the mean magnetic energy in the @xmath89 plane , leading to a lower values of @xmath120 at maximum .",
    "[ anal ] shows that the efficiency of the intensification significantly decrease as the foot - point magnetic field rises .",
    "it is confirmed that even using larger @xmath121 , we can obtain similar results , i.e. strong amplification is achieved with larger @xmath112 .",
    "we investigate an intensification mechanism of magnetic field near the base of solar convection zone following the `` explosion '' process using three - dimensional mhd simulation .",
    "such a mechanism in addition to differential rotation has been suggested by studies of flux emergence , which typically require field strength in excess of those provided by differential rotation alone .",
    "our main result is that the enough intensification can be achieved even in a three - dimensional situation as long as the spatial scale of the imposed perturbation in the direction normal to the magnetic flux sheet is sufficiently large",
    ". when this spatial scale is small , the efficiency of intensification of magnetic field significantly decreases . here a strong converging flow in the direction perpendicular to the field ( @xmath37-direction ) is driven , which leads to weaker flows in the @xmath36-direction .",
    "the latter are crucial for the field amplifiction as well as stabilization of the foot - points in our setup .    in this study",
    ", we used a similar setup as @xcite , which allows to study the explosion process in an adiabatically stratified atmosphere , avoiding the complex situation caused by presence of turbulent thermal convection . using a more realistic setup with a superadiabatic convection zone and storage of magnetic flux in a subadiabatic region beneath could influence our results in the following way :    if the initial magnetic flux is stored in a subadiabatic stratification the foot - point magnetic field is more stable and the criterion for the length scale of the perturbation might be relaxed , i.e. also shorter perturbations could lead to stronger amplification .",
    "however , even with more realistic storage in a subadiabatic region , there is no force that could stop the horizontal motion of the foot - points ( buoyancy only works in vertical direction ) . as a consequence also here",
    "a fundamental difference between tube - like and sheet - like behavior will persist .",
    "the presence of turbulent thermal convection could significantly influence our results since during the explosion process the strength of magnetic field near the top of the rising flux drops significantly .",
    "thus , it is possible that the connection between top and foot - point magnetic field is disturbed by turbulence , resulting in a reduction of field intensification .",
    "therefore more realistic simulations including a stably stratified overshoot region / radiation zone and a superadiabatic convection zone are required in order to investigate the detailed conditions under which the explosion process leads to substantial intensification of magnetic field .",
