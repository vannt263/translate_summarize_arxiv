    "even more general we show , roughly speaking , that the set of solutions to the finite container problem ( see below ) in an euclidean space of dimension @xmath2 has no `` simple structure '' ( see definition [ def : lc ] ) .    to make this precise , we consider the euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath6 endowed with inner product @xmath7 and norm @xmath8 .",

    "many specific instances of this container problem have been considered ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "our main result shows that families of packing sets with a `` simple structure '' can not be solutions to the container problem if @xmath17 is smooth and @xmath1 sufficiently large .",

    "an example of an lc - family in which isometries can be chosen so that is finite in any bounded region , is the family of _ hexagonal packing sets_. these are isometric copies of subsets of a _ hexagonal lattice _ , in which every point in the plane is at minimum distance @xmath37 to six others . for the hexagonal packing sets , condition ( ii ) is satisfied for all @xmath38 .",

    "* idea . * the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is subdivided into four preparatory steps and corresponding propositions .",
    "these technical ingredients are brought together at the end of this section .",
    "given an lc - family @xmath27 of packing sets , the idea is the following : we show that packing sets @xmath29 , with @xmath16 sufficiently large , allow the construction of packing sets @xmath39 with @xmath40 and with @xmath41 fitting into a smaller dilate of @xmath17 .",
    "roughly speaking , this is accomplished in two steps .",
    "first we show that `` rearrangements '' of spheres near the boundary of @xmath17 are possible for sufficiently large @xmath1 .",

    "such an initial modification then allows rearrangements of all spheres ( proposition [ prop : prop3 ] and [ prop : prop4 ] , depending on property ( ii ) of definition [ def : lc ] ) , so that the resulting packing fits into a smaller dilate of @xmath17 .",
    "for example , consider a hexagonal packing in the plane : it is sufficient to initially rearrange ( or remove ) two disks in order to subsequently rearrange all other disks , so that no disk is in contact with others afterwards ( see figure [ fig : plane - instability ] , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .        how do we know that the new sphere packings @xmath42 fit into a smaller dilate of @xmath17 ?",

    "clearly @xmath46 and @xmath47 whenever the _ convex hull _ @xmath48 of @xmath39 ( and hence @xmath39 itself ) is contained in the interior @xmath49 of the convex hull of @xmath15 .",
    "thus in order to prove that @xmath15 does not attain @xmath50 for any convex container @xmath17 , it is sufficient to describe a way of attaining a packing set @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath51    * i. * let us first consider the `` shapes '' of packing sets @xmath52 attaining @xmath25 . here and in what follows , @xmath52 denotes a packing set with @xmath53 .    in order to define the `` shape '' ,",

    "since @xmath17 is smooth , the sets of outer normals at boundary points of @xmath63 become uniformly small for large @xmath1 .",

    "the restriction to smooth convex containers simplifies the proof , but we strongly believe that theorem [ thm : main ] is valid for other containers as well , e.g. certain polytopes . on the other hand there might exist containers for which theorem [ thm : main ] is not true . in particular in dimension @xmath4 it seems very likely that theorem [ thm : main ] is not true for polytopal containers @xmath17 with all their facets lying in planes containing hexagonal sublattices of the _ fcc lattice _",
    "( see section [ sec : kepler - assert ] ) .",
    "that is , for these polytopal containers @xmath17 we conjecture the existence of infinitely many @xmath1 , for which subsets of the _ fcc lattice _ attain @xmath25 . an example for at least `` local optimality '' of sphere packings ( with respect to differential perturbations ) in suitable sized tetrahedra was given by dauenhauer and zassenhaus @xcite .",
    "a proof of `` global optimality '' seems extremely difficult though , as it would provide a new proof of the sphere packing problem ( `` kepler conjecture '' , see section [ sec : kepler ] ) .",

    "_ similar `` phenomena '' occur for other packing problems .",
    "for example , if we consider finite packing sets @xmath15 with minimum diameter or surface area of @xmath84 , or maximum parametric density with large parameter ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shapes of solutions tend to certain convex bodies , e.g. a sphere .",
    "[ sec : kepler ]    kepler s statement , quoted in the introduction , was later referred to as the origin of the famous sphere packing problem known as the _ kepler conjecture _",
    "e.g. @xcite p.5 , @xcite p.4 ) .",
    "in contrast to the original statement , this problem asks for the maximum sphere packing density ( see below ) of an infinite arrangement of spheres , where the `` container '' is the whole euclidean space . as a part of hilbert s famous problems @xcite , it attracted many researchers in the past .",
    "its proof by hales with contributions of ferguson ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , although widely accepted , had been a matter of discussion ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    following kepler @xcite , the _ cubic or hexagonal",
    "close packings _ in @xmath224 can be described via two dimensional layers of spheres , in which every sphere center belongs to a planar square grid , say with minimum distance @xmath37 .",
    "these layers are stacked ( in a unique way ) such that each sphere in a layer touches exactly four spheres of the layer above and four of the layer below .",
    "the packing attained in this way is the well known _",
    "face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice packing_. we can build up the fcc lattice by planar hexagonal layers as well , but then there are two choices for each new layer to be placed , and only one of them yields an fcc lattice packing .",
    "all of them , including the uncountably many non - lattice packings , are referred to as _ hexagonal close packings ( hc - packings)_. note that the family of hc - packings is of limited complexity , because up to isometries they can be built from a fixed hexagonal layer .",
    "let @xmath225 then in our terminology kepler asserts that , in @xmath224 , @xmath226 is attained by hc - packings .",
    "his assertion , if true , would imply an `` answer '' to the sphere packing problem ( kepler conjecture ) , namely that the density of the densest infinite sphere packing @xmath227 is attained by hc - packings for @xmath228 ; hence @xmath229 .",
    "note that this definition of density is independent of the chosen convex container @xmath17 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .    as a consequence of theorem [ thm : main ] ,",
    "kepler s assertion turns out to be false , even if we think of arbitrarily large containers .",
    "consider for example the containers @xmath230 for @xmath26 .",
    "[ cor : corollary2 ] let @xmath2 , @xmath19 a smooth convex body and @xmath27 an lc - family of packing sets in @xmath6 . then there exist arbitrarily large @xmath231 such that @xmath232 is not attained by packing sets in @xmath27 .",
    "we may as well think of arbitrarily small spheres packed into a fixed container @xmath17 . for @xmath3 , we call @xmath233 a sphere packing if distinct elements @xmath34 and @xmath81 of @xmath15 have distance @xmath234 .",
