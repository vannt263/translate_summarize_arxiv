    "following the early discoveries of x - ray sources in globular clusters in the mid-1970s ( clark 1975 ; clark , markert & li 1975 ) , it was proposed that the x - ray emission of these clusters was due to accretion of intracluster material released by stellar mass loss onto central black holes ( bahcall & ostriker 1975 ; silk & arons 1975 ) .",
    "this started a debate about whether globular clusters contain black holes of intermediate masses ( i.e. greater than the @xmath1 30 m@xmath2 limit for black holes formed through normal single star evolution , but less than the @xmath3 m@xmath2 seen in the smallest galactic nuclei ) .",
    "the difficulties of stellar dynamics has prompted a search for accretion constraints on the presence of intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "as pointed out by maccarone ( 2004 ) and maccarone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , deep radio searches may be a very effective way to detect intermediate - mass black holes in globular clusters and related objects .",
    "indeed , for a given x - ray luminosity , supermassive mass black holes produce far more radio luminosity than stellar - mass black holes .",
    "the relation between black hole mass and x - ray and radio luminosity empirically appears to follow a `` fundamental plane '' , in which the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity increases as the @xmath10.8 power of the black hole mass ( falcke & biermann 1996 , 1999 ; merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , kording & markoff 2004 ) . also , as the luminosity of accretion onto a black hole decreases , the ratio of radio to x - ray power increases @xcite .",
    "accretion theory suggests that the bondi - hoyle rate @xcite overestimates the actual accretion rate by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude , e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus , the x - ray luminosities from accretion of the interstellar medium by intermediate - mass black holes in globular clusters are likely to be well below detection limits of current x - ray observatories . considering the prediction of @xcite , that the black holes should have about 0.1 per cent of the total cluster mass",
    ", the radio luminosities of the brightest cluster central black holes may be detectable with existing instrumentation @xcite .",
    "several methods have been considered for proving the existence of these intermediate - mass black holes ( in the @xmath4 m@xmath2 range ) , but to date there is no conclusive evidence for their existence",
    ". searches for radio emission from globular clusters have mostly yielded only upper limits ( maccarone , fender & tzioumis 2005 ; de rijcke , buyle & dejonghe 2006 ; bash et al .",
    "although , the cluster g1 in m31 seems to have evidence for harbouring an intermediate - mass black hole @xcite , including radio detection .",
    "however , beyond globular clusters , there are other possibilities for intermediate - mass black holes",
    ". they may be produced in the core collapses of @xmath5-m@xmath2 population iii stars , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "other good candidates for hosting intermediate - mass black holes are thought to be young dense star clusters ( portegies zwart & mcmillian 2002 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ; grkan , freitag & rasio 2004 ) and ultraluminous x - ray sources , whose x - ray luminosities well exceed the eddington luminosity of a ten solar - mass compact object ; for more details see @xcite .",
    "the main evidence favouring an intermediate - mass black hole in ngc 6388 is that the observed surface density profile has a power - law shape with a slope @xmath6 in the inner one arcsecond of the cluster .",
    "this slope is shallower than expected for a post core collapse cluster and is consistent with the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole @xcite .",
    "the surface density profile provided an estimated mass of 5700 @xmath7 500 m@xmath2 @xcite for the central black hole in ngc 6388 and it motivated us to propose radio observations of the source .    here , we report on radio observations with the australia telescope compact array ( _ atca _ ) of ngc 6388 that led to an upper limit on the mass of the putative intermediate - mass black hole located at the centre of ngc 6388 . in sec .  2 , we describe the analysis of an archival _ chandra _ observation and our new _ atca _",

    ", we describe the results of the x - ray and radio observations",
    ". then we discuss , in sec .  4 , the methodology for setting an upper limit on the mass of a central black hole in ngc 6388 and the uncertainties .",
    "ngc 6388 was observed with the chandra x - ray observatory @xcite using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopy array ( acis - s ) in imaging mode .",
    "_ observation ( obsid 5055 ; pi haldan cohn ) began on 21 april 2005 02:28:32 ut and had a useful exposure of 45.2  ks .",
    "although an analysis of the _ chandra _ data was recently published by @xcite , we improved the localisation of the x - ray sources in the centre of the cluster by removing the pixel randomisation .",
    "the _ chandra _ data were subjected to standard data processing ( ciao version 4.1.2 using caldb version 4.1.4 ) and then reprocessed to remove pixel randomisation because we are interested in sources in the crowded region near the cluster centre .",
    "we also applied an aspect correction as described on _ chandra _ aspect webpages .",
    "the total event rate on the s3 chip was less than 1.7  c / s throughout the observation indicating there were no strong background flares .",
    "we observed ngc 6388 with the australia telescope compact array in configuration 6d ( baselines up to 6 km ) between 24 and 28 december 2008 .",
    "the data were obtained simultaneously at 8384 & 9024 mhz and at 18496 & 18624  mhz with 16 h and 17 h on - source integration time , respectively .",
    "we observed in phase - reference mode ; the phase calibrator was 1740 - 517 and the primary calibrator was pks 1934 - 638 .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the miriad software package @xcite in a standard way .",
    "we first constructed an image of the full area viewed by the acis - s3 chip using all valid events in the 0.38  kev band .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "aspect uncertainty is @xmath8 at 90 per cent confidence . to attempt to improve on this we searched for x - ray sources with counterparts @xcite in the 2mass catalogue of infrared sources with a j magnitude brighter than 14 @xcite .",
    "we excluded sources within @xmath9 of the cluster centre due to the source crowding in that region .",
    "we choose x - ray sources which are likely foreground stars by selecting those with soft spectra @xcite , specifically those with more counts in the 0.51.5  kev band than in the 1.56  kev band @xcite .",
    "there are 10 such sources with a detection significant above @xmath10 .",
    "of these 10 , one at @xmath11 is located within @xmath12 of a 2mass source and a second at @xmath13 is within @xmath14 of a 2mass source .",
    "there are 636 such 2mass sources in the search area of @xmath15@xmath16 . with 10 x - ray sources ,",
    "the probability of one chance overlap within @xmath17 is 0.0014 and the probability of two chance overlaps is @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the _ chandra _ astrometry appears to be accurate to within @xmath17 .",
    ".x - ray sources in the core of ngc 6388 [ xsources ] [ cols=\">,>,^,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we then constructed images of a @xmath19 region centered on the cluster core with pixels which are @xmath20 in the 0.38  kev and 210  kev bands .",

    "[ chandra_image ] shows an x - ray image of the core of ngc 6388 in the 210  kev band with the position of the cluster center of gravity , @xmath22 @xcite , superimposed .",
    "the radius of the circle is @xmath23 which is equal to the sum in quadrature of the _ chandra _ aspect uncertainty of @xmath17 ( see above ) and the uncertainty of @xmath24 in the position of the centre of gravity .",
    "two of the _ chandra _ sources lie near the centre of gravity error circle .",
    "the error circle for source # 12 overlaps the edge .",
    "source # 7 lies @xmath25 from the centre of gravity .",
    "if we use the coordinates calculated from the 210  kev image ( and not 0.38 kev as above ) , then source # 12 moves inside the centre of gravity error circle , while source # 7 moves further away .",
    "we extracted x - ray spectra for these two sources using circular extraction regions with radii of 1.5 pixels centred on the coordinates given in table  [ xsources ] .",
    "the extraction radius is smaller than usual for _ chandra _ sources , but this is necessary given the source crowding .",
    "the 80 per cent encircled power radius is @xmath10.7 arcsec thus , the measured source fluxes were increased by a factor of 1.2 to account for the flux outside the extraction region .",
    "we fitted the x - ray spectra using the _ sherpa _ spectral fitting package and response matrices calculated using the mkacisrmf tool in _",
    "ciao_. we used the @xmath26-gehrels statistic to evaluate the goodness of fit due to the low numbers of counts in some spectral bins .",
    "a good fit , @xmath27 , was obtained for source # 12 with an absorbed power - law spectrum with a photon index , @xmath28=@xmath29 and an equivalent hydrogen absorption column density of @xmath30 .",
    "the absorbed flux in the 0.38  kev band was @xmath31 and the unabsorbed flux was @xmath32 in the 0.38  kev band and @xmath33 in the 210  kev band .    an absorbed power - law provided a good fit for the spectrum of source # 7 , @xmath34 .",
    "the best fit parameters were a photon index , @xmath28=@xmath35 and an equivalent hydrogen absorption column density of @xmath36 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath37 was fixed to the galactic hi column density along the line of sight .",
    "the absorbed flux in the 0.38  kev band was @xmath38 and the unabsorbed flux was @xmath39 in the 0.38  kev band and @xmath40 in the 210  kev band .",
    "after reduction of the _ atca _ radio data , we found there are no radio sources detected in association with the cluster centre of gravity nor at the locations of any of the _ chandra _ x - ray sources within the cluster ( fig .",
    "[ radio_image ] ) .",
    "we assumed a flat spectrum ( as likely for a low - luminosity accreting black hole ) in order to combine the data sets to achieve the best noise level . in naturally weighted maps , by combining 8.4 & 9 ghz data the rms noise level was 27  @xmath0jy and combining 18.5 ghz & 18.6 ghz data the rms was 54  @xmath0jy .",
    "combining all of the datasets did not lead to better rms as the higher frequency data is more noisy .",
    "therefore , our best achieved rms noise level at radio frequencies is 27 @xmath0jy .",
    "considering the best achieved r.m.s . value obtained from our _ atca _ radio observations and adopting a 3@xmath41 upper limit , the upper limit on the radio flux of any ( undetected ) source is estimated to @xmath42  @xmath0jy / beam . the distance of ngc 6388 was adopted from @xcite with the value of 13.2 @xmath7 1.2  kpc .",
    "therefore , we obtained an upper limit for the radio luminosity of the putative intermediate mass black hole in ngc 6388 of @xmath43 erg s@xmath44 at 5  ghz ( @xmath45 , where we assumed a flat radio spectrum , as is likely for a low - luminosity accreting black hole ) .",
    "previously , @xcite found that three of the _ chandra _ sources ( # 12 , 7 and 3 ) coincide with the cluster centre of gravity .",
    "they did not attempt to spatially resolve these three sources and therefore obtained one averaged spectra for the three sources .",
    "after reanalysing the data and removing the pixel randomisation , we find that only one source ( # 12 ) is consistent with the location of the centre of gravity ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "in addition , we successfully measured the spectrum of each source individually . the unabsorbed x - ray flux of source # 12 is @xmath46 erg @xmath47 s@xmath44 , and the corresponding x - ray luminosity is @xmath48 erg s@xmath44 in the 0.38  kev band .",
    "we will use this value in all subsequent analysis .",
    "a study of the colour - colour diagram of the x - ray sources throughout the cluster revealed that most of them seem to be low mass x - ray binary , one source is probably a high - mass x - ray binary and four others are soft sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite treated the three central _ chandra _ sources as one and noted that the difference between the x - ray flux of these sources measured by _ xmm - newton _ in 2003 versus by _",
    "chandra _ in 2005 is a factor of only 1.11 .",
    "this may indicate that variability of the x - ray sources is small , but there are only two observations .    from our x - ray data analysis , we managed to localise three separate sources in the centre of the cluster .",
    "we studied their x - ray colours and used the source classification method of @xcite .",
    "this revealed that source # 3 is very soft , probably a cataclysmic variable .",
    "source # 7 seems to be an x - ray binary and source # 12 is either an absorbed source or an x - ray binary .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of source # 12 is consistent with the accretion luminosity of even a 10 solar - mass black hole in quiescence . on the basis of the x - ray spectra",
    ", there is no real clue to distinguish between an intermediate - mass black hole and low mass x - ray binary .",
    "source # 12 has a power - law spectrum with @xmath49 which is consistent with the spectra of quiescent stellar - mass bh which have @xmath50 ( corbel et al 2006 , 2008 ) , but is also consistent with the spectrum expected from a quiescent intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "thus , the localisation , the source categorisation of @xcite , and the x - ray spectrum all favour source # 12 as the best candidate to be subjected upon further analysis as a potential intermediate mass black hole .      the fundamental plane of accreting black holes is a relationship between x - ray luminosity , radio luminosity and black hole mass ( merloni et al 2003 , falcke et al .",
    "the relations between mass accretion rate and radio luminosity has been studied for black hole x - ray binaries and low luminosity active galactic nuclei .",
    "it is found that the x - ray luminosity is uniquely determined by the black hole mass and radio luminosity via a linear equation in logarithm space .",
    "this relationship is referred as `` the black hole fundamental plane '' .",
    "it is valid for hard state objects i.e. for objects accreting at low eddington value .",
    "this relation requires radiatively inefficient accretion , like advection dominated or jet dominated accretion flows .",
    "if one investigates in more detail whether the x - ray source satisfies the criteria for radiative inefficiency , as required for application of the fundamental plane @xcite , we can conclude , that even if @xmath51  m@xmath2 , the ratio of x - ray luminosity to eddington luminosity , @xmath52 .",
    "so , the source needs to be accreting at a low eddington - rate . taking this into account and assuming that the central source is a black hole , we can set constraints on the mass of the black hole using the relationship found by merloni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) :    @xmath53    or the similar relation found by @xcite : @xmath54    we note that the relation ( eq .",
    "2 . ) found by @xcite , which considered flat spectrum , low - luminosity radio sources , such as those we expect in the centre of dwarf galaxies or globular clusters , more likely reflects the present case .",
    "however eq .  1 provides results that are consistent within the uncertainties . as eq .",
    "2 gives a higher mass and has less scatter than eq .  1 ( even than the equation found by @xcite )",
    ", we use the value given by eq .  2 in all subsequent analysis .",
    "inserting the measured x - ray luminosity ( @xmath55 ) of source # 12 and the measured upper limit on its radio luminosity ( @xmath56 ) into eq .",
    "2 leads to an upper limit for the mass @xmath57 of the central black hole of @xmath58 735 @xmath59 .",
    "however , we must consider the intrinsic scatter in the measured fundamental plane relation of 0.12 dex ( @xmath1 32 per cent ) within one @xmath41 ( and the uncertainty of the distance ) . therefore the result is @xmath60  735  @xmath7  244  @xmath59 . we adopt the 3-@xmath41 upper limit , @xmath61 , as a conservative limit on the black hole mass .",
    "if source # 7 actually lies at the cluster centre of gravity instead source # 12 , then we note that source # 7 has a harder spectrum than # 12 , being still consistent with a low luminosity accreting black hole and that the difference between their x - ray flux is a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , this would not change the results described above .",
    "if none of the x - ray sources are associated with the cluster centre of gravity , then we can not use the fundamental plane to obtain a limit on the black hole mass .      in this section",
    ", we investigate more in detail the consistency of the x - ray emission of source # 12 with bondi - hoyle accretion and compare ngc 6388 with the cluster g1 . for a black hole of mass @xmath57 moving with velocity @xmath62 through gas with hydrogen number density @xmath63 and sound speed @xmath64 , the expected accretion rate via the bondi - hoyle process @xcite is    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the proton mass @xcite .",
    "the expected x - ray luminosity is then @xmath67 and parametrized for ngc 6388 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the efficiency for converting accreted mass to radiant energy in the accretion flow of the black hole , and @xmath72 indicates the fraction of the bondi - hoyle accretion rate that is accreted by the black hole .",
    "the intracluster gas density can vary in the @xmath73 @xmath74 range @xcite . for ngc 6388",
    "the gas density is not measured .",
    "ionised gas with an electron density of @xmath75@xmath74 has been detected in the globular cluster 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "recent studies on their stellar populations find similar ages for ngc 6388 as 47 tuc @xcite , therefore we set @xmath63 = 0.1  @xmath74 for ngc 6388 . however a higher gas content may be expected for ngc 6388 @xcite .",
    "we also set @xmath62=0 km / s and @xmath76 = 15 km / s .",
    "now , the key factors determining the luminosity are the radiative efficiency of accretion ( @xmath71 ) and the fraction of bondi - hoyle accretion rate that reaches the black hole ( @xmath72 ) . considering our previously obtained 3-@xmath41 upper limit on mass of @xmath11500 m@xmath2 and taking @xmath77 , we find that the lowest allowed radiative efficiency is @xmath78 , similar values have been found for other systems in the radiatively inefficient regime ( fender et al .",
    "2003 , krding et al .",
    "the highest value of radiative efficiency can be taken as 0.1 , i.e. for a radiatively efficient schwarzschild black hole .",
    "so , @xmath71 can vary in the @xmath79 $ ] range .",
    "@xcite showed that the lack of detection of isolated neutron stars accreting from interstellar medium implies a fraction of bondi - accretion of the order of @xmath80 , see also @xcite .",
    "however , there is evidence that the central black hole of globular clusters can accrete at a higher fraction of the bondi - rate than suggested by @xcite .",
    "g1 is an enigmatic star cluster in m 31 thought by some to be a globular cluster , but by others to be the core of a stripped dwarf galaxy @xcite and contains multiple stellar populations .",
    "dynamical evidence in g1 suggested the presence of a 20 000 solar mass black hole ( gebhardt , rich & ho 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "x - ray observations revealed an x - ray source with a 0.210 kev luminosity of @xmath81  erg  s@xmath44 @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a radio source was also detected at the location of the core of the cluster of g1 .",
    "the measured radio flux ( 28  @xmath0jy ) was in good agreement with the predictions ( 30 and 77 @xmath0jy ) @xcite .",
    "although , @xcite find that the x - ray emission is still consistent with a single x - ray binary or a collection of x - ray binaries .",
    "@xcite find the most plausible scenario is that g1 accretes at closer to 0.1 of the bondi - rate with a radiative efficiency under 0.01 .",
    "it is therefore possible that the fraction ( @xmath72 ) of the bondi - hoyle accretion is as high as 0.1 .",
    "taking the value - as there is no evidence for pulsar detection in ngc 6388 - obtained by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as a low end and the value of g1 as a high end , the fraction of the bondi - rate ( @xmath72 ) can vary on the @xmath82 $ ] range .",
    "now , we discuss two scenarios : first , we set the fraction of the bondi - rate to @xmath83 and we assume inefficient accretion ( @xmath84 ) and secondly , we set @xmath85 and we assume efficient accretion ( @xmath86 ) . using eq .",
    ", other cases will lead lower values of black hole mass than derived from the fundamental plane ( see sec .",
    "4.2 ) . in order to reproduce the measured x - ray luminosity ( by using eq",
    ", the first scenario will give an estimate of @xmath13070  m@xmath2 for the mass of the putative central black hole mass .",
    "such a black hole mass is inconsistent with the derived mass on the fundamental plane .",
    "additionally , this value is even higher than the value of 2600 m@xmath2 , which one can obtain considering the raw estimate that , the black hole mass is 1/1000 of the total stellar mass ( 2.6 @xmath87 10@xmath88  m@xmath2 ; @xcite ) of the globular cluster @xcite ; therefore this scenario is less favourable .",
    "the second scenario will result in a black hole mass of @xmath1970  m@xmath2 .",
    "this is formally consistent with the one - sigma value derived from the fundamental plane .",
    "although , given the high uncertainties of @xmath71 and @xmath72 and the intrinsic scatter of the fundamental plane , our conservative upper limit on the mass of the putative intermediate - mass black hole is @xmath89 m@xmath2 , the 3-@xmath41 upper limit derived from the fundamental plane .",

    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observational data analysis were carried out by @xcite . removing the pixel randomisation allowed us to identify a unique source coincident with the cluster centre of gravity with properties consistent with those expected for a black hole accreting at a low rate . with the x - ray detection and optical surface density fit ,",
    "the only missing piece of the puzzle was a radio detection . on the basis of the x - ray luminosity",
