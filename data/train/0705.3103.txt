    "the most general symmetries of local relativistic quantum field theories include supersymmetry , a phenomenological version @xcite of which is awaiting a final judgement within the next few years as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) turns on . indeed ,",
    "one of the most coveted targets of the lhc is to capture the higgs boson , and supersymmetry , admitting chiral fermions together with their scalar partners in the same representations , tacitly provides a rationale for treating the higgs as an elementary object @xcite .",
    "furthermore , through the removal of the quadratic divergence that plagues the ordinary higgs mass , phenomenological supersymmetry has emerged as a leading candidate of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a key signature of the minimal version of supersymmetry is that the lightest higgs boson mass obeys an upper bound ( @xmath2 135 gev , see below )  a prediction which will be put to test during the lhc run .",
    "now , supersymmetry is an integral part of string theory which attempts to provide a quantum picture of all interactions . since string theory is intrinsically a higher dimensional theory , a reanalysis of some 4-dimensional ( 4d ) supersymmetric wisdom in the backdrop of extra dimensions might provide important clues to our search strategies . considering that the higgs is the most - wanted entity at the lhc , in this paper we address the following question which we believe is extremely timely : _ what is the upper limit of the lightest cp - even neutral higgs mass if the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is embedded in extra dimensions _ ?",
    "we consider the embedding first in one and then in two extra dimensions .",
    "let us first discuss why this is an important issue .",
    "recall that mssm has two higgs doublet superfields ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , and supersymmetry does not allow the scalar potential to have independent quartic couplings .",
    "gauge interactions generate them through supersymmetry breaking @xmath5-terms and the effective quartic interactions are written in terms of the gauge couplings .",
    "this makes the higgs spectrum partially predictive , in the sense that at the tree level the lightest neutral higgs ( @xmath6 ) weighs less than @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the ratio of two vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) ) .",
    "however , @xmath10 receives quantum corrections which , due to the large top quark yukawa coupling and for heavy stop squarks , can become as large as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an average stop squark mass @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath10 is then pushed to around 135 gev for squark mass in the @xmath13(tev ) range .",
    "notice that the non - observation of the higgs boson at lep2 has already set a lower limit @xmath14 gev @xcite , which is satisfied only if a sizable quantum correction elevates the higgs mass beyond the tree level upper limit of @xmath7 .",
    "this implies ( i ) lower values of @xmath15 , which is usually chosen in the range @xmath16 , are disfavoured , and ( ii ) the squark mass @xmath12 has to be in the tev range , which also sets the scale of a generic soft supersymmetry breaking mass @xmath17 .",
    "the mssm prediction of a light higgs is also in line with the indication coming from electroweak precision tests that the neutral higgs should weigh below 199 gev 114.5 gev apply , strictly speaking , for the sm higgs .",
    "however , in the ` decoupling limit ' of the mssm ( large @xmath18 leading to full - strength @xmath19 coupling ) , which is the region of interest in the present paper , the above limits continue to hold . ]",
    "@xcite . the so called ` little hierarchy ' problem then arises out of an order of magnitude mass splitting between the higgs and the superparticles .    adding a gauge singlet superfield ( @xmath20 ) in the mssm spectrum and coupling it with @xmath21 via the superpotential @xmath22 helps to ease the tension .",
    "not only does this next to minimal version of supersymmetry ( the so called nmssm @xcite ) help to address the ` @xmath23 problem ' , it also generates a tree level quartic coupling in the scalar potential which modifies the tree level upper limit on @xmath10 through @xmath24 $ ] ( see @xcite ) . assuming @xmath25 to be in the perturbative regime , i.e. , @xmath26 , one basically obtains a new contribution @xmath27 to the tree level @xmath28 . this way the low @xmath29 regime can be revived .",
    "since many supersymmetric couplings depend on @xmath29 , search strategies alter in a significant way if the disfavoured low @xmath29 region is thus resurrected is preferred by electroweak baryogenesis as well @xcite.]@xmath30 .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a different approach which also revives the low @xmath29 region .",
    "we stick to the mssm particle content , but embed it in a higher dimension compactified at the inverse tev scale @xcite .",
    "although we argued in the beginning that string theory provides a rationale for linking the two ideas , namely , supersymmetry and extra dimension , establishing any rigourous connection between the two at the level of phenomenological models is still a long shot .",
    "here we take a ` bottom - up ' approach : we first outline what has already been studied in the phenomenological context of tev scale extra - dimensional scenarios , and then illustrate what we aim to achieve in this paper .    1 .",
    "consider first scenarios with one extra dimension ( with inverse radius of compactification around a tev ) but without supersymmetry .",
    "a typical model is the universal extra - dimensional scenario ( ued ) where all particles access the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "constraints on this scenario from @xmath31 of the muon @xcite , flavour changing neutral currents @xcite , @xmath32 decay @xcite , the @xmath33 parameter @xcite , other electroweak precision tests @xcite , implications from hadron collider studies @xcite , etc .",
    "imply that @xmath34 gev .",
    "a recent inclusive @xmath35 analysis sets a stronger constraint @xmath36 gev @xcite .",
    "these scenarios are motivated from many phenomenological angles .",
    "they could lead to a new mechanism of supersymmetry breaking @xcite , address the fermion mass hierarchy in an alternative way @xcite , provide a cosmologically viable dark matter candidate @xcite , stimulate power law renormalization group running @xcite , admit substantial evolution of neutrino mixing angles defined through an effective majorana neutrino mass operator @xcite , etc .",
    "2 .   our object of interest is a supersymmetric theory ( e.g. mssm ) but embedded in a higher dimension .",
    "here we ask the following question : _ what would be the shift in the higgs mass due to radiative effects induced by extra dimensions _ ? in the kind of scenarios we consider ,",
    "the sm bosons along with their superpartners access the higher dimensional bulk .",
    "additionally , sm fermions of one or more generations together with their superpartners also do so . from a 4d perspective , all the states which access the bulk will have kaluza - klein ( kk ) towers .",
    "the zero modes , i.e. , those states which do not have any momenta along the extra coordinates , are identified with the standard 4d mssm spectra .",
    "now , not only the top quark and the stop squarks would contribute to the radiative correction to @xmath28 , their kk partners would do so as well .",
    "as it turns out , the radiative correction driven by the kk states has the same sign as the one from the zero modes . as a result",
    ", @xmath37 becomes larger and thus the upper limit on @xmath10 is pushed to higher values beyond the usual 4d mssm limit of around 135 gev . as we shall see , in the absence of any left - right scalar mixing , the new contribution coming from kk modes is to a good approximation proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "this fits our intuition that the kk contribution falls with higher kk modes and vanishes both when @xmath39 and in the limit of exact supersymmetry .",
    "we can interpret the result in two ways . either",
    ", we take large @xmath29 and @xmath13(tev ) squark mass that yielded the 4d supersymmetry limit @xmath2 135 gev , in which case the new upper limit shoots up by several tens of gev . or , we may admit lower @xmath29 and/or accommodate lighter zero mode squarks which were hitherto disfavoured in the 4d context .",
    "either way , the higgs phenomenology gets an interesting twist which is intuitively comprehensible and analytically tractable , owing largely due to the fact that we are here dealing with only _",
    "one additional _",
    "parameter , namely , the radius of compactification .",
    "moreover , the top quark mass which appears with fourth power in the expression of @xmath37 is now known to a precision better than ever ( @xmath40 gev @xcite ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", we have considered the embedding of 4d supersymmetry in one as well as two extra dimensions .",
    "there are quite a few advantages of considering a 6d gauge theory @xcite even in a non - supersymmetric scenario : ( i ) number of fermion generations is restricted to three , or a multiple of it , if the global su(2 ) gauge anomaly has to cancel @xcite , ( ii ) proton decay is adequately suppressed , which is difficult to achieve in 5d ued , thanks to a discrete symmetry that survives as a subgroup of the 6d lorentz group @xcite , ( iii ) observed neutrino masses and mixings can be nicely explained @xcite , and ( iv ) kk vector modes offer better opportunities to be explored @xcite .",
    "we shall see that qualitatively the kk contributions to the radiative corrections of @xmath10 from 5d and 6d theories are similar , the quantitative estimates differ due to the different density of kk states in the two cases . in 5d ,",
    "the kk states are spaced as @xmath41 ( modulo their zero mode masses ) where @xmath42 , an integer , is the kk number , whereas in 6d , a similar expression holds except @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two different sets of kk numbers corresponding to the two compactified directions .",
    "section ii is basically a review of the standard derivation of the upper limit of the lightest neutral higgs in conventional 4d mssm in the effective potential approach .",
    "this paves the way , in section iii , to upgrade the above derivation for accommodating contributions from the kk modes of the top quark and squarks in 5d and 6d scenarios . in section iv",
    ", we shall comment on the numerical impact of the higher kk modes on the lightest neutral higgs mass and its consequences .",
    "we shall draw our conclusion in the final section .",
    "mssm requires two higgs doublets for three good reasons : ( i ) to avoid massless charged degrees of freedom , ( ii ) to maintain analyticity of the superpotential , and ( iii ) to keep the theory free from chiral anomaly , which requires two higgs doublets with opposite hypercharges .",
    "we denote these two complex scalar doublets as @xmath46 whose su(2)@xmath47 u(1 ) quantum numbers are ( 2,@xmath481 ) and ( 2,@xmath491 ) respectively . @xmath50 couples with down - type quarks and charged leptons , while @xmath51 couples with up - type quarks .",
    "this guarantees natural suppression of flavour - changing neutral currents in the limit of exact supersymmetry .",
    "the tree level potential involving these two doublets is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings , and @xmath58 @xmath59 are the pauli matrices .",
    "note that the quartic coupling is related to the gauge couplings .",
    "the part involving the neutral fields is given by @xmath60 after spontaneous symmetry breaking the minimum of @xmath61 involves the following two vevs : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the combination @xmath64 gev sets the fermi scale .",
    "now , out of the eight degrees of freedom contained in the two higgs doublets three are absorbed as the longitudinal modes of the @xmath65 and the @xmath66 bosons , while the remaining five modes appear as physical states .",
    "of these five states , two are charged @xmath67 and three are neutral ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "our present concern is the neutral sector of which ( @xmath69 ) are cp - even , while @xmath70 is cp - odd . from the separate diagonalisation of the cp - odd and cp - even neutral mass matrices",
    "two important relations emerge : @xmath71 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , by definition , @xmath6 is the lighter of the two cp - even higgs .",
    "these in turn give rise to the following sum rule and inequality : @xmath72 i.e. , at the tree level ( i ) the lighter of the two cp - even higgs ( @xmath6 ) weighs less than @xmath7 , and ( ii ) the cp - odd higgs ( @xmath70 ) is heavier than @xmath6 but lighter than @xmath73 .",
    "we shall now discuss how the above tree level relations are affected by quantum loops @xcite .",
    "we shall confine our discussion on the correction to @xmath10 only , and that too at the one - loop level .",
    "we note two important points :    1 .",
    "radiative corrections to @xmath10 are dominated by the top quark yukawa coupling ( @xmath74 ) and the masses of the stop squarks ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) . for large values of @xmath9 , the contributions from the @xmath77-quark sector also assume significance .",
    "we shall ignore loop contributions mediated by lighter quarks or the gauge bosons .",
    "the tree level higgs mass is protected by supersymmetry . in the limit of exact supersymmetry ,",
    "the entire quantum correction vanishes .",
    "so radiative corrections to @xmath10 will be controlled by @xmath17 .",
    "three different approaches have been adopted in the literature to calculate the radiative corrections to @xmath10 : ( i ) effective potential technique , ( ii ) direct diagrammatic calculations , and ( iii ) renormalisation group ( rg ) method , assuming @xmath78 and fixing the quartic coupling proportional to @xmath79 at that scale and then evolving down to weak scale . in this paper",
    ", we shall follow the effective potential approach primarily for the sake of conveniently including the effect of new physics later .",
    "we first start with an rg - improved tree level potential @xmath80 which contains running masses @xmath81 and running gauge couplings @xmath82 . the full one - loop effective potential is now given by @xmath83 where , in terms of the field dependent masses @xmath84 , @xmath85 the @xmath86-dependence of @xmath87 cancels against that of @xmath80 making @xmath88 independent of @xmath86 up to higher loop orders .",

    "it may bear mentioning again that in these calculations we have retained the loop conntributions from the @xmath191 and @xmath77 quarks only .",
    "the other quarks and gauge bosons make negligible impact .",
    "also , we have dealt only with real mssm parameters and limited our studies up to one - loop kk contributions .",
    "we have not , therefore , included either the two - loop improvements of the 4d mssm calculations or the numerical effects of the phases associated with complex mssm parameters in our discussions ( for a recent survey , see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the virtues for which supersymmetry stands out as a leading candidate of physics beyond the sm is that it sets an upper bound on the higgs mass .",
    "the lightest neutral higgs mass , @xmath10 , could at most be @xmath7 at the tree level , but is pushed further obeying a definite relation , obtained from quantum corrections , involving @xmath10 , @xmath95 and the stop squark mass , @xmath12 .",

    "we highlight our main findings :    1 .",
    "the kk towers of the top quark and stop squarks provide a positive contribution to @xmath28 raising it by several tens of gev . if we ignore left - right scalar mixing and assume moderate @xmath196 , then using eq .",
    "( [ approxmh ] ) and summing over all the kk modes , we obtain @xmath197 .",
    "this is a 5d result . including the left - right scalar mixings , i.e. , non - zero @xmath23 and trilinear parameters ,",
    "somewhat enhances the magnitude of the correction ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "as in the case of 4d mssm , here too the size of the correction is controlled by the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "2 .   if we consider a 6d theory with two extra dimensions compatcified on a chiral square , whose motivations have been mentioned earlier , the correction gets sizably enhanced ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , compared to 5d , due to a denser packing of kk states , which are now fixed by two independent kk numbers .",
    "non - observation of a higgs boson weighing below 114.5 gev disfavours low @xmath29 in 4d mssm .",
    "some part of this region can be revived by extra dimensional embedding ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the 4d mssm relationship between the lightest neutral higgs mass and the stop squark mass is extremely profound in the sense that its specific form does not depend on the supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "if supersymmetry is embedded in extra dimension(s ) and , with some cooperation from nature , the kk states happen to be light enough to mark their imprints on the lhc data recorder , then the relationship between the stop mass and the higgs mass alters in a numerically significant way ( see fig .",
