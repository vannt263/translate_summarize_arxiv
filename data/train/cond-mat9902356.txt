    "early studies of the liquid - vapor critical point of ionic systems were carried out on molten salts and related systems , @xcite with relatively poor temperature stability and resolution .",
    "@xcite results for ionic critical behavior at low reduced temperatures were first published by pitzer and co - workers a decade ago .",
    "@xcite subsequently other solutions of organic salts , with low critical temperatures , were studied yielding somewhat puzzling results .",
    "one of the systems studied in detail was triethyl-@xmath5-hexylammonium triethyl-@xmath5-hexylboride ( n@xmath6b@xmath6 ) in diphenyl ether . in 1990 ,",
    "singh and pitzer@xcite reported a coexistence - curve exponent , @xmath7 , close to the mean field value of @xmath8 .",
    "their data are compatible with ising criticality ( @xmath9 ) only if the mean field to ising crossover occurs at a reduced temperature , @xmath10 is unusually small  in ordinary fluids @xmath11 and the observed critical exponents are clearly of ising character . in 1992 ,",
    "zhang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite confirmed the mean - field critical behavior of this system by reporting a susceptibility exponent , @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite    a different system also studied nearly a decade ago was tetra-@xmath5-pentylammonium bromide dissolved in water .",
    "japas and levelt sengers @xcite reported an ising - type coexistence curve with @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "other studies reported ising or mean - field criticality depending on the particular ionic solution . for reviews of the various experiments , see : refs .",
    "@xcite    the presence of the solvent , which lowers the critical temperature of the salts , complicates the situation considerably .",
    "the bare coulomb interaction is reduced by a factor that depends on , @xmath0 , the static dielectric constant of the solvent .",
    "additionally , in polar solvents , solvation shells are formed around each ion and the resulting effective interactions between the ions are not well characterized at present .",
    "the mechanisms driving criticality in these various systems are not clear , but there appear to be two classes of critical behaviour : coulombic systems , where the electrostatic interactions primarily drive the phase transition and solvophobic mixtures in which the phase transition is mainly driven by the short - ranged interactions that favor solvent - solvent and solute - solute contacts .",
    "@xcite    in table [ tab : tm_tc ] we display data on the melting temperature of three salts and their critical temperatures in solution . clearly , if @xmath15 is _ lower _ than @xmath16 the coulomb interactions are too weak to drive the phase transition , especially in high dielectric - constant solvents .",
    "@xcite however , there are cases where the ionic interactions are strong enough to play a role at temperatures of the order of @xmath16 . in these systems , @xcite a crossover from mean - field to ising criticality was observed , with reduced crossover temperatures @xmath17 , that decrease as the relative ionic character or _ ionicity _ increases , i.e. , the dielectric constant of the solvent decreases .",
    "ising exponents are observed only closer to @xmath16 as the ionicity increases .",
    "it is plausible to suppose that the effect of the coulomb interactions is the reduction of the crossover temperature ; this reduction might be so strong that ising critical behavior could not be observed in practice .",
    "ideal coulombic electrolyte criticality would then be characterized by classical ( mean - field ) behavior , while solvophobic electrolyte criticality remained in the 3d ising universality class .",
    "@xcite    however , a theoretical description of the dependence of @xmath17 on the coulombic and other interactions is still lacking . indeed",
    ", previous attempts to study the crossover temperature of model ionic fluids do not seem to predict any reduction , at least for the restrictive primitive model ( rpm ) consisting of an equal number of equisized positive and negative hard - spheres .",
    "following the sugestion of fisher and levin , @xcite leote de carvalho and evans @xcite and fisher and lee @xcite employed a ginzburg criterion which led them to conclude that the reduced crossover temperature of the rpm is similar to that of ordinary fluids .",
    "although the study of criticality in the rpm has proceeded for half a decade @xcite progress has been slow and no definitive conclusions have yet been reached .",
    "fisher and levin @xcite extended the original debye - hckel theory and established the importance of including dipolar bjerrum pairs @xcite and of accounting for the solvation of the neutral , but electrostatically active , pairs in the screening ionic fluid .",
    "these authors have obtained the best theoretical estimates of the critical density and temperature of the rpm when compared with the results of computer simulations .",
    "@xcite    however , the direct fisher - levin approach does not address the question of the universality class of the rpm .",
    "on the other hand , computer simulations of the critical behavior of the rpm have been carried out ; but these also have not provided clear - cut answers .",
    "_ @xcite have obtained evidence of consistency with ising exponents , as have orkoulas and panagiotopoulos ; @xcite but valleau and torrie @xcite claim that no sign of ising behavior is observed in their simulations above criticality .    nevertheless , it is instructive to pose a more modest question , namely : `` how does the introduction of weak electrostatic interactions affect the near - critical behavior of a fluid that , when uncharged , displays ising criticality ? ''",
    "while one can not discard the possibility that the long - range coulomb interactions discontinuously change the universality class , @xcite the debye screening of the ions at any non - zero ionic strength can be regarded as giving rise to an effective short - ranged interaction , @xcite and thus  at least in a perturbative sense  we may suppose that weak electrostatic couplings will not change the character of the transition .",
    "they must , nonetheless , affect all the _ non - universal _ critical properties : and many of these are of independent interest .",
    "accordingly , in this article , we address this last issue .",
    "specifically , we consider an ordinary fluid of dielectric constant @xmath0 with only short - range , or van der waals interactions , that exhibits criticality of ising character at a temperature @xmath18 .",
    "for simplicity in this essentially exploratory study , we focus on a fully symmetric model in which the particles of the original , uncharged fluid are all identical having repulsive cores of diameter @xmath3 and fixed attractive pair interactions , the strength of which is measured by @xmath4 .",
    "then we ask how the reduced crossover temperature , @xmath17 , changes when electrostatic interactions are switched on so that half the particles become positive ions of charge @xmath19 and the rest negative ions carrying charge @xmath20 .",
    "the strength of the coulomb forces may be measured by the `` contact energy '' @xmath1 , so that one can imagine either increasing @xmath21 from zero or , for fixed charges , decreasing the dielectric constant @xmath0 from very high values . naturally ,",
    "the critical temperature of the system will change and it is thus reasonable to define the _ ionicity _ of the critical charged system by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the standard definition of reduced temperature in primitive model electrolytes .",
    "@xcite the ionicity will constitute our perturbative parameter .    to treat the model ,",
    "we first consider , in section ii , the purely ionic limit ( where @xmath24 ) and , using a lattice cutoff , reformulate the coulomb interactions via a quadratically truncated sine - gordon transformation .",
    "@xcite this corresponds to a debye - hckel limiting - law level of analysis although the expansion could be carried to higher order .",
    "@xcite then , in section iii , we introduce ( charge independent ) short - range interactions with the aid of a kac - hubbard - stratonovich ( khs ) @xcite transformation . in the resulting ( approximate ) hamiltonian we integrate out the sine - gordon charge field @xmath25 , perturbatively to obtain an effective landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) hamiltonian in terms of a spin ( or density ) field , @xmath26 , but with coefficients depending on the ionicity , @xmath27 .",
    "finally , effectively truncating at the @xmath28 level , we estimate the crossover temperature with the aid of a ginzburg criterion @xcite in section iv .",
    "this treatment indicates that , in general , the reduced crossover temperature decreases by an amount of order @xmath29 .",
    "such a weak change is far too small to describe the experimental observations although the overall trends seem to correlate : see table ii and the discussion and conclusions in section v.",
    "consider a system of unit - valence positive and negative ions with repulsive cores but otherwise interacting only through coulomb forces . to account approximately for the ionic cores we may suppose the ions reside on the sites of a lattice of spacing @xmath3 equal to the atomic diameter . alternatively , in momentum space",
    ", we can employ a cutoff on a corresponding brillouin zone or , for convenience , approximate this by a sphere of radius @xmath30 .",

    "the remaining symbols have their usual meanings : @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the chemical potentials ( divided by @xmath41 ) for the positive and negative ions , respectively .",
    "since this is a first approach and we are interested in real fluids ( rather than details induced by the lattice structure ) we do not take the coulomb interaction proportional to the lattice green s function but simply use the reduced three - dimensional isotropic coulomb potential so that in ( [ partition_1 ] ) we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the distance separating sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "we examined the perturbative effects of the electrostatic interactions on the near - critical behavior of a simple fluid by using the ginzburg criterion to estimate the crossover temperature , @xmath17 , as a function of the ionicity , defined more explicitly by @xmath189 : see ( [ ionicity ] ) .",
    "the calculations indicate that as @xmath171 increases , the effective range of interaction , @xmath143 , increases slowly while the coupling of the fourth order term in @xmath190 , namely @xmath172 , decreases for realistic values of @xmath27 and @xmath114 after an initial , relatively rapid transient . as a result ,",
    "the relative ginzburg scale , @xmath191 , [ see ( [ ginz2 ] ) ] decreases with increasing @xmath171 , by up to @xmath192 ( within the approximations ) : see fig .",
    "this suggests that the expected domain of ising - type behavior around @xmath16 should , likewise , be reduced by the presence of coulombic forces .",
    "although we believe these results are interesting , one must certainly be cautious in applying them to real ionic systems .",
    "first , it is not certain that the ginzburg criterion provides a sufficiently reliable measure of @xmath17.@xcite indeed , despite the correct trend of @xmath149 with the ionicity @xmath27 seen in table ii , the predicted magnitudes of the reductions of @xmath17 are vastly smaller than observed in the real systems studied .",
    "second , in our perturbative treatment of the model the critical behavior is always driven by the short - range interactions , and only nonuniversal critical parameters are affected by the electrostatic interactions .",
    "it is unlikely that such a mechanism describes satisfactorily the criticality of all real ionic systems .",
    "in fact , as argued by pitzer , @xcite there are chemical systems in which the ionic interactions are almost surely the principal determinants of the critical behavior . and , of course , in the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) only coulombic forces act but a critical point is surely realized .",
    "@xcite such systems clearly lie outside the range of validity of our truncated , perturbative treatment . furthermore ,",
    "as suggested both theoretically @xcite and by the experiments of pitzer and narayanan , @xcite coulombic electrolytes of high ionicity may lie on a different global thermodynamic locus than do solvophobic systems such as we have sought to describe in our present approach .    within the approximation presented",
    ", @xmath172 never vanishes ; however , it is possible that carrying the calculations to higher order @xcite would lead to negative @xmath172 for sufficiently large ionicity . at a mean - field level in a simple lattice system that would suggest tricriticality @xcite and the presence of an `` antiferromagnetic '' or crystal phase .",
    "but , by any measure , one would then need to retain sixth and , possibly , higher order terms in the effective hamiltonian ; @xcite and , in that case , a renormalization group treatment would seem necessary to elucidate the nature of the resulting transition(s ) . @xcite it should be forcibly stressed , however , @xcite that a tricritical point _",
    "per se _ can not arise in a normal one- or two - component fluid system except by some special , nongeneric accident ! ( in a three - component system a tricritical point can occur but is characterized by a particular temperature , @xmath193 , and three fixed densities , say , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 . )",
    "the present approach has been extended @xcite to _ asymmetric _ models with _",
    "distinct _ short - range interactions , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the calculations yield an effective hamiltonian very similar to that obtained by nelson and fisher @xcite in their study of metamagnets in the presence of an external magnetic field ( which , when large enough , induces tricriticality ) .",
    "a renormalization group calculation employing the @xmath200-expansion has been performed : @xcite it yields an unstable gaussian fixed point , a symmetric ising - type ( fisher - wilson @xmath5=1 ) @xcite fixed point , and two further _ asymmetric _ ising fixed points .",
    "in addition , a separatrix appears , at the @xmath28 level of approximation , that delimits a region of `` runaway '' flows : such behavior requires proper study of the hamiltonian with higher order terms retained .",
    "@xcite however , as hinted above , the significance of such flows within the context of fluid systems is unclear at this stage .",
