    "since our ukirt observation has secured that passive spiral galaxies are truly spiral galaxies with no star formation , we now have to take it more seriously that these passive spiral galaxies exist in the cluster perimeter regions ( goto et al .",

    "it has been long discussed whether the properties of cluster galaxies are by their nature or nurtured later . according to the standard hierarchical clustering model , galaxies in high density regions of the universe such as",

    "in addition to this , galaxies in dense regions have been subject to additional physical mechanisms specific to the dense regions .",

    "if passive spiral galaxies do not exist in the low density field regions , the result may favor the nurture scenario where only cluster specific physical mechanisms can create passive spiral galaxies .    various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cluster galaxy evolution .",

    "strong dynamical interactions such as cluster tidal forces and major interaction / merging of galaxies are less preferred since such processes distort the morphology of galaxies and can not explain spiral arm structures in passive spiral galaxies .    among the rest ,",

    "( 2004 ) discussed that plasma gas density is too low at the virial radius for ram - pressure stripping ( of the cold gas in a galactic disc ) , concluding that stripping of hot halo gas is preferred to the stripping of cold gas .",
    "however , using the analytical model , fujita ( 2003 ) showed that the cold gas stripping can be effective at around the virial radius at higher redshift ( also see fujita & goto 2004 ) .",

    "<S> passive spiral galaxies  unusual galaxies with spiral morphology without any sign of on - going star formation  have recently been discovered to exist preferentially in cluster infalling regions ( at about the virial radius , or at a local galaxy density of @xmath0 mpc@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery directly connects the passive spiral galaxies to the cluster galaxy evolution studies such as the butcher - oemler effect or the morphology - density relation , i.e. , passive spiral galaxies are likely to be transition objects between high - z blue , spiral galaxies and low - z red , cluster early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , detailed study of passive spiral galaxies potentially could bring a new insight on the underlying physical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy evolution . however , in previous work , passive spiral galaxies are selected from the low resolution optical images with @xmath2 arcsec of seeing . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , passive spirals could be a mis - identification of s0 galaxies ; or dusty - starburst galaxies which are not passive at all .    to answer these questions </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a deep , high - resolution , near - infrared imaging of 32 passive spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our high resolution @xmath3 band images show clear spiral arm structures . </S>",
    "<S> thus , passive spirals are not s0s . </S>",
    "<S> optical - infrared colour does not show any signs of dusty - starburst at all . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is likely that they are truly `` passive '' and `` spiral '' galaxies in the midst of cluster galaxy evolution .    </S>",
