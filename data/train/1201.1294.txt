    "the orange dash  dot line indicates sfr(h@xmath6 ) @xmath3 sfr@xmath13  0.4 mag uncorrected reddening , suggesting that the majority of the low - luminosity sources can be explained by this relatively small extinction or less .",
    "the cold gas appears to be less dusty than in normal star - forming galaxies , indicating a different origin for the fuel .",
    "it is worth noting that the relation indicating a small apparent extinction could also result from an intrinsically larger h@xmath6 flux , e.g. due to an additional heat source @xcite .",
    "for this scenario to be plausible , the effect would need to be more pronounced in the less ir - bright bcgs , which could be true if the absolute contribution to the observed h@xmath6 emission was similar in all bcgs , and negligible in those with the highest sfrs .",
    "the surprising h@xmath6 non - detection of a851 suggests a much higher extinction ( @xmath57 @xmath18 1 mag ) than the typical bcg .",
    "further examination of the hst optical imaging reveals a large tidal tail , while the bcg also has a projected offset from the x - ray peak of @xmath17280 kpc @xcite , 1020@xmath9 greater than the majority of this sample .",
    "even if a cool - core were present it would have little influence .",
    "it is likely that galaxy ",
    "galaxy interaction ( merger or harassment ) , rather than the cool  core phenomenon , is responsible for the star formation , and hence the extinction resembles the normal star - forming galaxy population .",
    "we now attempt to constrain the fir luminosity of  non - cool - core \" cluster bcgs . to achieve this , the bcgs in the hls and locuss sub - samples are classified into three exclusive categories : detected in fir and h@xmath6 , h@xmath6-detected only ( ie not fir - detected ) , and undetected in either fir or h@xmath6 .",
    "note that ( 1 ) the three bcgs from e10 would all fall into the first class , and ( 2 ) we neglect a fir - detected only category as it would consist of the debatable bcg in a851 alone .",
    "for each class , the herschel maps are co - added ( stacked ) after centering on the optical bcg position and removing exceptionally bright nearby sources via point source fitting .    confusion noise is a time - invariant rms uncertainty and hence once reached , integrating longer does not improve the detection limit ( in contrast to the more familiar instrument noise ) .",
    "however , confusion noise is still a zero - averaged gaussian rms and is not spatially invariant , so stacking on multiple known source positions from a prior catalog can detect a mean flux below the nominal confusion limit ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : stacking ] presents the pacs and spire 250 stacks for each of three categories . for brevity ,",
    "we analyze but do not show the longer wavelength spire stacks , which are broadly comparable to 250 .",
    "as one would expect , the fir - detected stacks ( 11 co - added frames ) exhibit a strong source in the center ( left panels , figure [ fig : stacking ] ) .",
    "this is a useful verification of the stacking algorithm and optical  fir alignment .",
    "the aperture corrected flux in the stacks equals ( to within @xmath175% ) the sum of the individual source fluxes , and the psf is not significantly larger than the nominal beam size for a single map .",
    "the stack of h@xmath6-detected sources without herschel flux ( center panels , figure [ fig : stacking ] ) only comprises 4 bcgs ( 3 from shallow locuss maps ) , and does not significantly improve upon the hls detection limit .",
    "therefore , although 24 photometry indicates that at least 3 of these sources should be close to the herschel limit for an individual map , the stack does not reveal a detection .    the final category , for those undetected in both h@xmath6 and the far - infrared , includes the vast majority of the sample ( 49 co - added frames ; right panels , figure [ fig : stacking ] ) .",
    "these can be considered the non - cool - core cluster bcgs .",
    "again , there is no detection , suggesting that a bcg in this class has a mean 3@xmath20 upper limit in each band ( 100500 ) of 0.6 , 1.1 , 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.8 mjy .",
    "these values are well below the confusion limit of a single source in all bands ( e.g. from @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : lumz ] shows the approximate luminosity limit ( as a function of redshift ) derived from these herschel flux limits . at any given redshift ,",
    "the average fir luminosity of a non - cool - core bcg is at least an order of magnitude below those in cool - core clusters , suggesting a mean sfr @xmath0 0.17 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 at z @xmath17 0.2 and sfr @xmath0 0.42 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 at z @xmath17 0.3 .",
    "the stacking analysis supports a bi - modal distribution of far - infrared luminosity , whereby bcgs are either star - forming ( due to a cooling icm ) , or are as quiescent as normal cluster early - types .",
    "we have presented strong circumstantial evidence that the fuel for star formation in fir - bright bcgs originates from the cooling icm .",
    "a recent study by @xcite asserts that the dusty gas may instead be from normal stellar mass loss , estimating a potential mass contribution up to 8 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 .",
    "we explore this further by calculating the stellar / dust mass ratio for our bcg sample , including limits on the ratio for the population undetected by herschel .",
    "dust masses are estimated at 500 via @xmath37 derived from the blackbody fit , using the formula    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the rest frame 500 flux , @xmath66 is the planck function and @xmath67 @xmath3 0.95 @xmath68 g@xmath5 is the absorption coefficient at 500 @xcite .",
    "rest frame 500 flux is estimated from the best fit r09 template .",

    "circular symbols represent herschel - detected bcgs .",
    "lower limits for hershel non - detections are given by small colored arrows ( colors indicate sample as in previous plots ; note hls galaxies are better constrained as the limits on fir flux , and hence dust mass , are lower ) . when fir - undetected bcgs are stacked within bins of similar stellar mass ,",
    "the limits in m@xmath70/m@xmath69 can be raised to the larger black arrows ( any stack of individually undetected bcgs gives a non - detection ; figure [ fig : stacking ] ) . ]",
    "the herschel - detected bcgs have 200 @xmath0 m@xmath70/m@xmath69 @xmath0 6000 , with a mean m@xmath70/m@xmath69 @xmath3 1570 ( figure [ fig : stellar_dust_mass ] ) .",
    "the limits for individual non - detected locuss bcgs are inconclusive as the herschel imaging is fairly shallow , while those from hls imaging have limits on m@xmath70/m@xmath69 of 400010000 . given that the entire stack of fir undetected bcgs shows no herschel flux ( figure [ fig : stacking ] ) , we can bin the undetected bcgs by stellar mass ( choosing 6 bins with seven bcgs each ) and estimate the limit on m@xmath70/m@xmath69 for the stack .",
    "the limit for each stellar mass bin is very similar with a mean m@xmath70/m@xmath69 @xmath8 15000 , or an order of magnitude higher than the ratio for herschel detected bcgs of the same stellar mass .",
    "if stellar mass loss were the dominant origin for the dusty gas driving bcg star formation , we would expect all bcgs of a given stellar mass to show similar star formation rates .",
    "otherwise , there would still be a need for a mechanism to trigger star formation in some bcgs while leaving the majority quiescent .",
    "we demonstrate a very good relation between sfr and central cooling time in figure [ fig : cooling ] , indicating a much stronger probability that the star formation is driven * and * fueled by the cooling icm .",
    "we present analysis of the largest cluster sample observed with at least 5 herschel band ( 100500 ) , combining the herschel lensing survey and locuss datasets . in total , the sample comprises 68 bcgs 0.08 @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath0 1.0 , of which 15 ( 22@xmath2% ) are detected by herschel , equivalent to @xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath38 l@xmath71 ( sfr @xmath18 2 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ) , including 7 classified as lirgs .",
    "this fractional detection rate is similar to the locuss clusters alone ( 25@xmath43% ) , which can be considered statistically identical to a volume - limited x - ray luminosity selected sample .",
    "eighteen of the 68 bcgs ( 26@xmath53% ) have detected h@xmath6 line emission .",
    "generally , far - infrared and h@xmath6 detections corresponds well , with 24 -based extrapolations to the far - infrared suggesting that most h@xmath6-detected bcgs unseen by herschel are only just below the detection limit .",
    "we present four associated strands of circumstantial evidence which strongly suggest that the fuel for star formation in fir - bright bcgs is not the same as in normal star - forming galaxies , but is directly connected to the central gas cooling in the cluster core .    1 .   a very good anti - correlation between herschel - derived star formation rate and the x - ray cooling time , for bcgs in cool - core clusters ( @xmath55 @xmath12 1 gyr ) ; 2 .",
    "fir stacks of the herschel - undetected bcgs ( 49 sources ) show no discernible flux , placing mean 3@xmath20 upper limits of 0.6 , 1.1 , 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.8 mjy on the five bands ( 100500 ) , and implying a mean sfr for non - cool - core cluster bcgs of sfr @xmath72 1 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ( z @xmath0 0.4 ) ; 3 .   a surprisingly low h@xmath6 extinction ( @xmath170.4 mag ) for all but the most ir - luminous , herschel - detected bcgs ( @xmath7 @xmath0 2@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 ) compared to similar normal star forming - galaxies ( @xmath171 mag ; e.g. @xcite ) , implying that the gas is significantly less dusty ; 4 .",
    "the stellar - to - dust mass ratio of herschel - detected bcgs is at least an order of magnitude below the ratio for non - cool - core bcgs of the same stellar mass , suggesting that normal stellar mass loss is unlikely to be the dominant star formation fuel source .",
