    "one of the most interesting in the related subjects is the color superconductivity of quarks @xcite .",
    "quark cooper pairs condense due to the bcs instability of fermi surface at high densities and low temperatures , while chiral condensates is dynamically generated by particle - antiparticle pairing at low temperatures and densities . since quarks have a color component of the @xmath2 gauge group ,",
    "the ground state of qcd is a superconductor with spontaneous breaking of color symmetry as a result of diquark condensates .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of spatial variations of fermionic condensates , the problem first investigated by deryagin , grigoriev and rubakov ( dgr ) in qcd with infinite number of colors @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "working in the perturbative regime @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the gauge coupling ) and by using the variational method , dgr discovered a previously unsuspected ( in the context of qcd ) instability of the fermi surface .",
    "namely , they found that an instability exists in the large @xmath3 qcd at finite densities which triggers condensate of particle - hole pairs ( overhauser effect ) having almost the same momentum @xmath6 with modulus @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the chemical potential .",
    "they showed that the ground state of the theory is spatially nonuniform , and has a periodically varying chiral condensate with wave number @xmath1 .",
    "following dgr , analyses which utilize either renormalization group analysis @xcite or wilsonian effective action formalism @xcite as well as the nambu - gorkov formalism @xcite were attempted to examine which effect , the overhauser or the bcs effects wins at large , at finite @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown in these analyses that the bcs effect overtakes the overhauser effect in weak coupling regime , while overhauser wins against bcs in strong coupling regime .",

    "the crystalline structure is a mismatch in the fermi surface of up and down quarks , and is apparently quite different from one for the periodic chiral condensate discussed by dgr .    to have better understanding of the relationship between these related but different phenomena , it is desirable to have a theoretical laboratory to investigate the underlying mechanism of these different phenomena . in this paper",
    ", we examine two simple ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models with quartic fermi interactions which would serve for this purpose .",
    "we examine the chiral gross - neveu model @xcite and the cooper pair model proposed by chodos , minakata and cooper @xcite .    the chiral gross - neveu model @xcite is a natural choice as the two - dimensional model which displays dynamical breaking of continuous chiral symmetry .",
    "it is also well known that the gross - neveu model at infinite number of flavor has a number of similar properties with qcd ; the renormalizability , the asymptotic freedom , and the similar phase structure on @xmath0-@xmath8 plane with those suspected for the two - flavor qcd .",
    "the cooper pair model @xcite is a toy model for `` color superconductivity '' in qcd but without color degrees of freedom .",
    "it nevertheless serves as a renormalizable asymptotically free model field theory which admits lorentz scalar fermion pair condensate .",
    "the model possesses @xmath9 flavor symmetry and @xmath10 symmetry of fermion number , and the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that at the large-@xmath11 limit the @xmath10 symmetry is dynamically broken by the lorentz singlet di - fermion condensate .",
    "it was also shown that the model , when coupled with the gross - neveu model , has a very similar phase structure with that of qcd with two flavor of quarks @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , continuous symmetry such as the @xmath10 symmetries of chirality or fermion number can not be violated by the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem @xcite in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "however , it is well understood by now in what sense the theorem is `` invalidated '' in the large-@xmath11 limit . as witten argued @xcite , the correlation functions of order parameters have power law behavior at large distances , and the power is inversely proportional to @xmath11 . therefore ,",
    "if we take the limit @xmath12 first and then send spatial distance between two order parameters infinity to use the cluster property , we formally obtain nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the order parameter .",
    "the procedure seems to give a consistent field theory , which is usuable as a theoretical laboratory for investigating various properties of condensate phenomena .",
    "we develop a systematic method for investigating the possibilities of spatial varing condensates , and then apply the formalism to discuss the chiral gross - neveu model and the cooper pair model in a unified way . in a recent paper , schn and",
    "thies @xcite treated the chiral gross - neveu model and concluded that the model has chiral wave condensates with a wave number @xmath1 .",
    "our formalism differs from theirs on several respects , in particular on how to regulate ultraviolet divergence .",
    "we will reexamine the chiral gross - neveu model in the light of our formalism and confirm their results .",

    "@xcite gives the true vacuum in this model .",
    "the question we have to ask here is why the cooper pair condensate is uniform differently from the chiral condensate in the chiral gross - neveu model . in order to answer this question",
    ", we had to better examine the fermion number and current of the variational ground state @xmath139 .",
    "after some calculations , they turn out to be @xmath144the fermion number is independent of the parameter indicating the spatial varidity @xmath42 in constrast to the chiral gross - neveu model .",
    "the spatial homogeneity can be explicitly broken in the chiral gross - neveu model because the fermion number is an order parameter for this symmetry breaking and it has a source , namely chemical potential . in the cooper pair model this symmetry breakdown , if it occurs , must be caused spontaneously because the fermion number is no longer the order parameter .",
    "then , the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the spatial homogeneity does not occur in our models .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the vacuum structure of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models with quartic fermi interactions at finite densities , with particular emphasis on the possibility of spatially nonuniform ground state .",
    "our treatment is restricted into the case of large-@xmath11 limit and of zero temperature .",
    "this is the unique place where we can have nonvanishing order parameter in 1 + 1 dimensions in the sense explained in introduction .",
    "we first examined the chiral gross - neveu model .",
    "we have constructed the effective potential by allowing the chiral condensate to vary periodically in space .",
    "the quasi - particle basis diagonalizing the fermionic hamiltonian of the theory was obtained by the fourier expansion after performing the chiral rotation .",
    "we have constructed an effective potential and have shown that the vacuum has a crystalline structure in which the chiral condensate oscillates with the wave number @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the result obtained by schn and thies @xcite .",
    "in the course of constructing the effective potential , we have found that the branch - dependent ultraviolet cutoff procedure is required to derive the correct effective potential . in the cutoff scheme ,",
    "the shifts from the explicit cutoff parameter play important role for the purpose of providing the system with the correct fermion number .",
    "while the branch - dependent ultraviolet cutoff procedure may look ugly , it is likely that it is required to preserve the fermion number in the system by cancelling the spectral flow induced by chiral rotation performed to obtain the basis used in our treatment .",
    "we have also constructed the variational ground state in terms of free particle basis and performed the bogoliubov - valatin transformation to obtain quasi - particle basis which diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "we have shown that the wave number @xmath1 of the chiral condensate results from the overhauser instability which generates particle - hole / antiparticle pairs with the total momentum @xmath1 , or @xmath145 .",

    ". it would be very interesting to construct a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model which possesses the analogous structure and work it out in the similar way as done in this paper .",
    "however , the formulation of the large-@xmath11 field theory with two different chemical potentials is highly nontrivial and we did not enter into the problem in this paper .",
    "the spatial variations of cooper pair condensate , if it forms , is due to the condensation of particle - particle pairs ( or antiparticle - antiparticle pairs ) with nonvanishing total momenta , as we observe from the bogoliubov - valatin transformation .",
    "it means that there is nozero expectation value of fermionic current . in other words ,",
    "the fermionic current becomes an order parameter for the breakdown of the spatial homogeneity .    on the other hand , the role of order parameter",
    "is played by fermion number in the chiral gross - neveu model , so that the breakdown of the spatial homogeneity is caused explicitly by the chemical potential ( in fact , the symmetry is restored at @xmath17 ) . in the cooper pair model , however , this symmetry breakdown is caused spontaneously if it occurs .",
    "the result , therefore , shows that the spatial homogeneity is not sopntaneously broken in our models .",
    "i wish to thank professor w. a. bardeen for suggesting possible connection between the regularization scheme employed in this paper and the spectral flow due to chiral rotation in the context of chiral anomaly .",

    "in addition , we can verify by using eqs .",
    "( [ bv1])([bv3 ] ) that the quasi - particle decomposition ( [ mode - ex ] ) with the cutoff ( [ uv - cut ] ) is reduced to the free - particle decomposition ( [ free - ex ] ) with the naive momentum cutoff , @xmath148 .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have proved that the ultraviolet cutoff must be eq .",
    "( [ uv - cut ] ) for @xmath146 at least .",
    "we believe that this cutoff is correct one at @xmath158 because the cutoff procedure must be insensitive to the vacuum expectation value , as mentioned in sec .  [",

    "now , we comment on the cutoff prescription from a different point of view .",
    "we enclose the system in a finite box of length @xmath91 for the purpose of counting the number of modes correctly .",
    "we shall impose periodic boundary conditions on @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this leads to the following conditions on @xmath42 and @xmath47 because of the chiral phase factor in wave functions ( [ eigst ] ) , @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are integer .",
    "one can see from the cutoff ( [ uv - cut ] ) that @xmath163 take @xmath164 values from @xmath165 to @xmath166 for @xmath167-branch , and @xmath168 values from @xmath169 to @xmath170 for @xmath171-branch , respectively , for fixed @xmath162 ( i.e. , fixed @xmath42 ) .",
    "here , @xmath172 is an explicit cutoff parameter .",
    "the number of modes included in divergent sums to evaluate the effective potential ( [ effec ] ) is kept constant , independently of @xmath162 ; @xmath173 .",
    "we depict the cutoff prescription in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] .",
    "this figure tells us that the cutoff implies summing modes in order from above with respect to the absolute value of energy , keeping the total number of modes fixed when @xmath17 .",
    "we also note that the fermion number of the state @xmath69 results from the difference of mode between @xmath167- and @xmath171-branch when we take the cutoff as fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] . since @xmath167-branch carries fermion number @xmath174 and @xmath171-branch carries @xmath175 as one can find from eq .",

    "it is consistent with the first equation of eq .",
    "( [ true - fn ] ) because we now ignore the region where @xmath178 .    for the cooper pair model",

    "[ fig : cutoff ] because the dispersion relations of quasi - particles in the two models coinside with each other at @xmath17 . in the cooper pair model",
