    "our construction relies on the important technique by zhang @xcite of reformulating diffusion equations involved as an inhomogeneous partial differential inclusion ; such a technique has been recently generalized by the authors to handle more general problems , including the high - dimensional ones , through a combination of the convex integration and baire s category methods ; see @xcite .    however , to construct weak solutions with certain specific features , as in @xcite , we need to introduce appropriate _ subsolutions _ of the associated partial differential inclusion and their _ transition gauge _ and to iterate some constructions while controlling the gauge .",
    "the controllable gauge , combined with the result on a one - dimensional parabolic problem @xcite , will enable us to iterate the constructions and eventually lead us to extract energy dissipation for the perona - malik type diffusions and energy allocation for the non - fourier type diffusions as well as the blow - up or concentration of the spatial derivative of weak solutions .",

    "<S> we study some non - parabolic diffusion problems in one - space dimension , where the diffusion flux exhibits forward and backward nature of the perona - malik , hllig or non - fourier type . </S>",
    "<S> classical weak solutions to such problems are constructed in a way to capture some expected and unexpected properties , including anomalous asymptotic behaviors and energy dissipation or allocation . </S>",
    "<S> specific properties of solutions will depend on the type of the diffusion flux , but the primary method of our study relies on reformulating diffusion equations involved as an inhomogeneous partial differential inclusion and on constructing solutions from the differential inclusion by a combination of the convex integration and baire s category methods . in doing so , we introduce the appropriate notion of subsolutions of the partial differential inclusion and their transition gauge , which plays a pivotal role in dealing with some specific features of the constructed weak solutions . </S>"
