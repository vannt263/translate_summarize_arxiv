    "the new field of nematic colloidal systems , or nematic emulsions stark , has gained a continuous growing interest over the past few years .",
    "the physics of these anisotropic colloidal systems has a deep similarity to the electrostatics .",
    "it has been shown that the director - mediated interaction is of a long range and possesses many other properties characteristic of the interaction between electric dipoles and quadrupoles lopatnikov , terentev0,kuksenok , prost , terentev , poulin1,lubensky , levtomchuk , poulin2,stark , lev2 .",
    "particle trapping techniques @xcite have been used to test this analogy and demonstrate experimentally the dipole - dipole yadaprl2004,smalyukh2004 , quadrupole - quadrupole @xcite , and mixed disclination - dipole @xcite pair interactions .",
    "reorientation of the elastic dipoles was shown to be responsible for phase transitions between different 2-dimensional colloidal lattices on a nematic - air interface @xcite . in the context of this analogy",
    "it is natural to expect that the coulomb interaction , which is fundamental to the electrostatics , has an important implication in the physics of nematic emulsions , too .",
    "recently  we developed the electrostatic analogy in nematic emulsions to the level of charge and its density @xcite .",
    "the director - mediated coulomb - like interaction of two colloids was shown to be fully determined by vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the transverse external torques ( perpendicular to the unperturbed director at infinity )  applied on the colloids vera1,vera2 .",
    "the scalar product @xmath5 plays the role of the product of two electrostatic charges in the @xmath6 interaction potential , and thus the two components of external torque play the role of two component elastic charge . because of the difference between the scalar electrostatics and vector nematostatics ,  the elastic analogues of the surface charge density , charge , and higher multipole moments consist of two tensors ( dyad ) .",
    "the multipole moments are naturally expressed via the elastic charge density which is determined by the two transverse director components on the surface imposing the director deformations .",
    "the interaction of the axially - symmetric sources , considered phenomenologically in @xcite , obtains as particular case of the interaction of two correspondent multipole dyads .",
    "small parameter of the theory is the ratio @xmath7colloid size / distance between colloids ) . for small @xmath8",
    "the theory provides all the tools available in the electrostatics , e.g. , for solving different boundary problems that can occur in the nematostatics of anisotropic emulsions . in this paper",
    "we apply the nematostatics developed in @xcite to the interaction between an elastic charge ( dyad ) and elastic dipole ( dyad ) with a wall ( surface bounding the nlc ) with different director alignments , which is the elastic counterpart of the well - known electrostatic problem solved by the method of images . in the next section",
    "we briefly introduce the colloidal nematostatics of ref.@xcite and show that the integral form of the torque balance plays the role similar to that of gauss theorem in the electrostatics . then the theory is applied to the colloid - surface interaction . a wall with homeotropic or planar director is shown to induce a repulsive @xmath0 force on the elastic dipole . the external torque , however , induces the elastic charge in this colloid and triggers switching to the @xmath1 repulsion .",
    "these results suggest that predictions of the colloidal nematosctatics can be tested by observing behavior of a single colloid at a sample surface which , in some situations , can be more robust than dealing with two colloids .",
    "the fundamental physical quantity of electric charge is purely phenomenological and must be _ postulated _ in the theory of elementary particles .",
    "in contrast , the nematostatics of the director field @xmath2 allows for _ introduction _ of two different charges .",
    "electrostatic potential is a scalar described by the linear laplace ( or poisson ) equation .",
    "it is the linearity that underlies the definition of the electric charge and its density as the source of electric field . at the same time",
    ", @xmath2 is a vector field which reduces to a single variable , described by a linear equation ( in the one constant approximation ) , only in 2 dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "owing to the linearity , the deformation source can be straightforwardly established : core of a point defect plays the role of a charge in 2d degennes , kleinert , chaikin , petty .",
    "the independence of the integral , expressing the topological invariant , of the integration contour plays the role anlogous to gauss theorem in electrostatics , the invariant itself plays the role of a conserved charge , and the 2d nematostatics is similar to the 2d electrostatics with its logarithmic potential : disclinations of the same signs repel and those of the opposite signs attract each other .    in 3d ,",
    "however , the analogy between topological defects and charge is completely lost . in 3d , the field @xmath2 is described by highly nonlinear equations @xcite so that point defects , though remain topological invariants , can not be linearly connected with the distortions of @xmath2 they induce @xcite .",
    "here the deformation sourse is the director distribution around the particle in its close vicinity of a size @xmath9 @xmath10 we refer to such the deformation domain as particle though the distortion therein can be induced by surface of a real particle , by topological defects with zero total topological charge @xcite , or by an external field dying out outside the domain area , fig .",
    "1 . consider 3-d director field @xmath11 uniform and parallel to the @xmath12-axis at infinity , @xmath13 . at distances @xmath14",
    "the small particle - induced perturbation @xmath15 of @xmath16 is transverse , @xmath17 and ( in the one - constant approximations assumed in this paper ) has the form    @xmath18    it is natural to identify the coefficients with the subscript @xmath19 in this expansion with the @xmath19-th component of elastic charge , elastic dipole , and elastic quadrupole , respectively .",
    "we seek the elastic analog of charge , following de gennes idea outlined in @xcite . a transverse external torque @xmath20 applied on a particle in the equilibrium is balanced by another ,",
    "the elastic torque distributed over a surface @xmath21 enclosing the particle , i.e. ,    @xmath22    whrere @xmath23 is the elastic constant , @xmath24 is the absolute antisymmetric tensor , all indices but @xmath19 run over @xmath25 and summation over the repeated indices is implied .",
    "the integral in the r.h.s .",
    "does not depend on the choice of enclosing surface @xmath26 and the equality ( [ gauss ] ) reminds one gauss theorem with @xmath27 in place of the electric charge . to further justify this connection one notices that integral ( [ gauss ] ) over a remote surface @xmath21 vanishes for any term in the expansion ( [ nt ] ) but the first one .",

    "this is fully justified by calculating the coulomb - like interaction in the elastic charge density representation developed in @xcite .",
    "the results of refs . @xcite instructive to our task here can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider a deformation source with the director distributions @xmath15 given on the surface of enclosing sphere @xmath21 with radius @xmath10 the quantity@xmath32plays the role of two component surface elastic charge density on the sphere @xmath33 using natural analogy with the electrostatics , we define the two component elastic multipoles via the surface charge density as the following integrals over sphere @xmath21 enclosing the particle :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the vector of a unit outer normal to @xmath33 with these definitions , we obtained the interaction of two particles with similar multipoles .",
    "interaction of two `` charged '' particles with nonzero @xmath38 is coulomb - like : @xmath39where we used relation ( [ q = gamma ] ) , @xmath40 is the transverse component of the torques exerted upon the @xmath41-th particles , and @xmath42 is the modulus of the separation vector @xmath43 the above connection between the elastic charge and external torque is thus fully justified . eq .",
    "( [ qq ] ) shows that , depending on the sign of @xmath44 the elastic coulomb interaction can be attractive or repulsive@xmath45 in contrast to the electrostatics and 2d nematostatics , the charges with the same sign attract and with different signs repel each other ( `` parallel torques '' attract whereas two `` antiparallel torques '' repel each other ) . although the colloids must be anchored to the director , the coulomb - like interaction does not directly depend on their specific shape and anchoring . instead",
    ", the elastic charge is determined by the coefficients describing the torque exerted upon the colloid by a given type of external field .",
    "for instance , this can be the vector of permanent electric and magnetic dipole or electric and magnetic polarizability tensors of a given colloid .",
    "if the external torques are absent , the interaction energy is expressed solely in terms of particles multipoles .",
    "the interaction between two `` dipolar '' particles is of the form    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a unit vector along the separation direction .",
    "eqs.([nt]),([sigma])-([udd ] ) ( along with the quadrupole - quadrupole potential derived in @xcite ) suggest the following interpretation .",
    "@xmath38 is the @xmath19-th component of the elastic charge and @xmath48 is its surface density at point @xmath49 on the sphere .",
    "the vector @xmath50 and tensor @xmath51 are the @xmath19-th dipole and quadrupole moments determined in the standard way by the surface charge density @xmath52 on the sphere@xmath45 as @xmath53 and @xmath54 are separate sources , they determine not only the @xmath55 and @xmath56 director components outside the particle , eq.([nt ] ) , but also two independent tensors ( dyad ) for each multipole moment , i.e. , @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 and so on .",
    "the above formulas can be used to solve boundary problems similar to those of electrostatics .",
    "the simplest boundary problem is the interaction of an elastic multipole with a surface bounding the nematic sample and imposing planar or homeotropic director alignment .",
    "here we consider this problem for an elastic charge and dipole .",
    "let us consider a single particle with a charge at a distance @xmath62 from a plane surface of a nlc sample .",
    "we assume that the anchoring is strong , the director alignment in the sample @xmath63 far from the particle is homogeneous and parallel to the @xmath12-axis , @xmath64but the angle it makes to the surfaces is arbitrary .",

    "is assumed to be large compared to the particle size .",
    "as the director on the sample surface is fixed , the boundary condition is @xmath69 , @xmath70    the problem can be solved using the mirror - image method .",

    "the boundary condition is satisfied for @xmath81 , @xmath70 the fact that the particle and its image are oppositely charged means that @xmath82 , figs.2,3 .",
    "as two opposite elastic charges repel each other , the elastic charge - wall interaction is repulsive .",
    "the repulsion force obtains from the interaction energy ( [ qq ] ) of the torques @xmath83 and @xmath84 by differentiating with respect to @xmath42 at @xmath85 , i.e. ,    @xmath86    the result depends on the direction of @xmath63 and thus on the surface tilt via the relation @xmath87      now consider the interaction between a wall and an elastic dipole represented by dyad @xmath88 eq.([d ] ) . in general , each of the two vectors @xmath59 and @xmath89 has three nonzero components .",
