    "<S> we measured the low - temperature thermal conductivity of a new layered superconductor with quasi - one - dimensional characteristics , the ternary telluride ta@xmath0pd@xmath1te@xmath2 with transition temperature @xmath3 4.3 k. the significant residual linear term of thermal conductivity in zero magnetic field and its rapid field dependence provide evidences for nodes in the superconducting gap . by measuring resistivity under pressures , </S>",
    "<S> we reveal a superconducting dome in the temperature - pressure phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of gap nodes and superconducting dome suggests unconventional superconductivity in ta@xmath0pd@xmath1te@xmath2 , which may relate to a charge - density wave instability in this low - dimensional compound . </S>"
