    "it is assumed that the first stellar generation mixed its nuclear burning products with original gas preparing the medium for formation of further stellar generations .",
    "possible explanations include slow winds of fast rotating massive stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* krause  2013 ) ) , or winds of agb stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dercole  2012 ) ) .",
    "we propose the cooling winds of massive stars as the place where the enriched stellar generation forms . here",
    "we discuss when thermally unstable clumps self - shield the uv photons produced by young stars of the cluster to become seeds for secondary star formation .",
    "in clusters above a critical mass , thermally unstable clumps are created out of hot gas of fast winds of massive stars ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "they shrink to a smaller volume , and the surrounding hot cluster wind is not able to push them out from the cluster , on the contrary , under the influence of the cluster gravity , they stream down towards the cluster center ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we derive the minimum time that is needed to accumulate enough mass so that the stream is self - shielded against uv photons from the star cluster . however , when the free fall time of clumps is shorter compared to the self - shielding time , the streams of thermally unstable clumps meet in the cluster center forming central concentration of warm gas .",
    "as soon as this central mass concentration is self - shielded , it cools further down to become the seed of a new enriched stellar generation .",
    "the results of our semi - analytical calculations of the evolution of clusters during its first 3.5 myr are given in fig .",
    "we assume a first stellar generation with the total mass @xmath1 m@xmath2 and a radius 3 pc .",
    "in such cluster , its wind is thermally unstable forming after 3.5 myr clumps with a total mass of a few times 10@xmath3 m@xmath2 .",
    "an important parameter of the model is the heating efficiency , giving the fraction of the wind mechanical energy that is converted into heat of the hot cluster winds . in the case of a low heating efficiency ( @xmath45 % )",
    "the free - fall time is shorter compared to the self - shielding time , forming centrally concentrated second stellar generation . on the other hand , when the heating efficiency is high ( @xmath430% ) the gas streams become self shielded before they reach the cluster center , resulting in a second generation cluster with a radius similar to that of the first stellar generation .    , pressure in the cluster wind @xmath5 , total mass flux @xmath6 and mechanical energy flux @xmath7 in the cluster wind , radius of the central clump @xmath8 , self - shielding time of the gas streams @xmath9 and central mass concentration @xmath10 during the first 3.5 myr .",
