    "the lack of timing noise and low fraction ( @xmath70 ) of powerlaw flux in the diskbb plus powerlaw model reported in table  [ xray_spec ] for the high flux state are consistent with its identification as the thermal state @xcite .",

    "broken powerlaw fits to the xmm spectra of i zw 18 produce break energies well below any of those reported for the ultraluminous state .",

    "these results suggest that the xmm spectrum is inconsistent with the criteria established for the ultraluminous state . however , we caution that the spectrum contains fewer counts than those used to establish the properties of the ultraluminous state .",
    "a higher quality spectrum with at least @xmath72 the number of counts would be needed to draw definitive conclusions .",
    "state transitions have been reported in ulxs that have been modeled and interpreted as being unlike those of stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries . @xcite",
    "analyzed multiple xmm observations of the two ulxs in ngc 1313 and classified their spectra into two states : the ` thick corona ' state and the ` very thick corona ' state .",
    "the spectra in both states are dominated by a coronae with @xmath73 in the range 16  kev .",
    "other authors have reported on spectral evolution in ulxs with the common characteristic that a compton component with @xmath741  kev , contributes a major and usually dominant fraction of the flux @xcite . in the xmm spectra of i zw 18 , a compton component modeled as a powerlaw produces a low fraction of the x - ray flux and a compton component with a low temperature ( @xmath71 13  kev ) produces no statistically significant improvement in the fit .",
    "thus , the spectral state transitions in most ulxs appear different from that seen in i zw 18 .    while rare , the thermal state and transitions between the hard state and the thermal state are sometimes found in ulxs .",
    "the strongest case for such a transition is for m82 x-1 which shows both a spectral transition and a simultaneous change in the x - ray timing properties of the source as seen in stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries @xcite .",

    "detection of a state transition similar to those seen in stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries strengthens interpretation of the hard spectrum seen in the chandra observation as evidence that the source was in the hard state .",
    "the maximum luminosities observed from stellar - mass black holes in the hard state are less than @xmath75 @xcite .",

    "as described above , we found that the spectral fits with simpl*kerrbb model were insensitive to the black hole spin ( @xmath30 ) and inclination ( @xmath34 ) , thus , we considered a range of values for @xmath30 and @xmath34 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the source is super - eddington for all spins .",
    "the accretion disk is expected to be geometrically thin , and thus the kerrbb model is expected to be valid , only for @xmath80 @xcite , so we considered only fits with @xmath81 .",

    "again , @xmath29 decreases and @xmath82 increases for higher spins .    in conclusion ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum from the binary in i zw 18 while in the high flux state can be interpreted in terms of a non - rotating black hole with super - eddington emission and a mass similar to that of the most massive known stellar - mass black hole @xcite . however ,",
    "if the nature of the state transition seen from the source is similar to those seen from stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries , including the luminosity threshold for the transition , then the compact object is likely a near maximally - rotating black hole with an unusually high mass @xmath78 .",
    "this is close to the maximum mass of @xmath88 predicted for black holes formed via stellar collapse in a low metallicity ( @xmath18 ) environment @xcite .",
    "modeling of the thermal state spectrum suggests a higher mass , @xmath89 , in the imbh range .",
    "we note that the x - ray source is coincident with a massive star cluster , sites suggested as potential places of original for imbhs @xcite , particularly in low - metallicity environments @xcite . due to their similarities to early galaxies , identification of an imbh in a bcd would be of particular interest for our understanding of the formation of early galaxies and supermassive black holes @xcite .",
