    "interest in ngc2362 was renewed by baade who remarked to johnson ( 1950 ) that the cluster is composed almost exclusively of early - type stars and devoid of nebulosity .",
    "this point was emphasized by baade in a lecture series given at harvard observatory in 1958 in which he used ngc2362 as an example of a cluster with a mass function that clearly deviates from that of the field ( baade 1963 ) .",
    "consequently , johnson ( 1950 ) conducted the first modern investigation of the cluster , determining a distance modulus from photoelectric magnitudes of the brightest cluster members of @xmath42 ( 1410  pc ) . in their study of galactic cluster luminosity functions ,",
    "vandenbergh & sher ( 1960 ) supported baade s statement regarding the dearth of intrinsically low - luminosity stars in ngc2362 , but conceded that the photographic plates of the cluster obtained at palomar observatory were affected by the lights of san diego .",
    "another limitation discussed by vandenbergh & sher ( 1960 ) was their inability to consistently reproduce star counts , a systematic error that certainly scaled with stellar magnitude .",
    "in retrospect , the low response and poor quality of the photographic plates , the overwhelming brightness of the early - type cluster members , and the human factor introduced by the star counting process probably all contributed to the non - detection of the cluster s faint stellar population .",
    "consequently , baade s early commentary and the conclusions of vandenbergh & sher ( 1960 ) remained undisputed for another three decades .",
    "the advent of ccd detectors brought about a revolution in observational astronomy , and with it a renewed search for an intrinsically faint stellar population around @xmath0 cma . in march 1990",

    "the challenges involved in direct imaging of the cluster , however , are considerable and deserve brief mention .",

    "these difficulties can be overcome with various imaging strategies ( quadrants around @xmath0 cma , combining multiple short exposures , etc . ) , but the faint stars in close proximity of @xmath0 cma remain extremely difficult to observe .",

    "the interior 1.6@xmath45 of the cluster were excluded from the study because of severe internal reflections , but for the first time , a substantial population of faint stars ( 415 ) was detected around @xmath0 cma . despite the presence of these stars",
    ", however , wilner & lada ( 1991 ) concluded that a deficit of low - mass ( @xmath460.8 m@xmath5 ) stars relative to the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf was apparent .",
    "one possible explanation put forth by wilner & lada ( 1991 ) was that if the duration of star formation within ngc2362 was longer than the age inferred from the evolutionary state of the b - type stars , mass segregation may have occurred , effectively moving low - mass members to the outer cluster regions where the survey was incomplete .",
    "kroupa , gilmore , & tout ( 1992 ) re - examined the luminosity function ( lf ) of ngc2362 presented by wilner & lada ( 1991 ) , comparing it to the solar neighborhood mass function regressed to an age of 10  myr .",
    "their modeled lf was found to be in agreement ( within error ) with that observed for ngc2362 , suggesting that the cluster mass function is similar to that of the field star population .",

    "<S> ngc2362 is a richly populated galactic cluster , devoid of natal molecular gas and dust . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster represents the final product of the star forming process and hosts an unobscured and near - complete initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> ngc2362 is dominated by the o9 ib multiple star , @xmath0 cma , as well as several dozen unevolved b - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> distributed throughout the cluster are several hundred suspected intermediate and low - mass pre - main sequence members . </S>",
    "<S> various post - main sequence evolutionary models have been used to infer an age of @xmath15 myr for the one evolved member , @xmath0 cma . </S>",
    "<S> these estimates are in close agreement with the ages derived by fitting pre - main sequence isochrones to the contracting , low - mass stellar population of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the extremely narrow sequence of stars , which extends more than 9 mag in the optical color - magnitude diagram , suggests that star formation within the cluster occurred rapidly and coevally across the full mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> ground - based near infrared and h@xmath2 emission surveys of ngc2362 concluded that most ( @xmath190% ) of the low - mass members have already dissipated their optically - thick , inner ( @xmath31 au ) circumstellar disks . _ </S>",
    "<S> spitzer _ irac observations of the cluster have confirmed these results , placing an upper limit on the primordial , optically thick disk fraction of the cluster at @xmath17@xmath42% . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of circumstellar disks among candidate members of ngc2362 is also strongly mass - dependent , such that no stars more massive than @xmath11.2 m@xmath5 exhibit significant infrared excess shortward of 8 @xmath6 m . </S>",
    "<S> ngc2362 will likely remain a favored target of ground - based and space - based observations . </S>",
    "<S> its well - defined upper main sequence , large population of low - mass , pre - main sequence stars , and the narrow age spread evident in the color - magnitude diagram ensure its role as a standard model of cluster as well as stellar evolution . </S>"
