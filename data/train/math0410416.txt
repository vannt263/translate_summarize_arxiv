    "it is well known that , when dealing with elliptic systems , in contrast to the case of a single second - order elliptic equation , the solely essential boundedness of the principal coefficients is not sufficient to ensure hlder continuity even of the solution ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  1 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "precise estimates on hlder s seminorms of the solution and its lower order derivatives is a matter of great concern in the study of nonlinear elliptic systems .",
    "in fact , these bounds imply good mapping properties of certain carathodory operators ensuring this way the possibility to apply the powerful tools of the nonlinear analysis and differential calculus .",
    "it turns out that `` suitable continuity '' of the principal coefficients of the system under consideration is sufficient to guarantee good regularity ( e.g. sobolev ) of the solutions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we deal here with discontinuous coefficients systems for which the discontinuity is expressed in terms of appurtenance to the class of functions with vanishing mean oscillation .",
    "although such systems have been already studied in sobolev spaces @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , our functional framework is that of the sobolev ",
    "morrey classes @xmath4 these possess better embedding properties into hlder spaces than @xmath3 and as outgrowth of suitable caccioppoli - type estimates , we give precise characterization of the morrey , @xmath0 or hlder regularity of the solution and its derivatives up to order @xmath5    let @xmath6 be a domain in @xmath7 @xmath8 and consider the linear system @xmath9 for the unknown vector - valued function @xmath10 given by the transpose @xmath11",
