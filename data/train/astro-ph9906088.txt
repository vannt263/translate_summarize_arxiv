    "defined either as equivalent widths or magnitudes , spectral indices ( si ) trace the strength of particular absorption features and are widely used as age ( @xmath3 ) and metallicity ( @xmath2 ) indicators for stellar systems ( e.g. elliptical galaxies , see , , and ) . in general , a single si depends on both parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 in the same way : metallic lines become stronger with increasing age and @xmath2 , while balmer lines become weaker . as a consequence , a given value for the si corresponds to either relatively young ages and high metallicities , or vice versa , which is known as the age / metallicity degeneracy ( ) .",
    "however , since the h@xmath4 line strength is more sensitive to age , while metallic indices are more sensitive to @xmath2 , these two fundamental parameters are derived by analysing observational data in the 2-dimensional diagram h@xmath4 versus metallic line strengths ( e.g. ; kuntschner , this volume ) .",
    "errors in the data are usually taken into account ( see ) whereas uncertainties in the models are not considered .",
    "the aim of this paper is to estimate these uncertainties .",
    "we examine si for ssps ( i.e. single age and single metallicity populations of single stars ) , which are obtained by summing up the contributions from all the stars that compose the population .",
    "the @xmath5 , for example , is given by @xmath6)=-2.5\\cdot\\log{{\\sum _ { * }   10^{-0.4\\cdot({\\rm mg}_{2}^{*})}\\cdot f{\\rm_c^*}}\\over{\\sum _ { * }   f{\\rm_c^*}}}\\ ] ] in eq . 1",
    ", @xmath7 is the continuum flux ( in the relevant wavelength window ) and @xmath8 is the value of the index of a single star of the ssp .",
    "the latter is specified by fitting functions , which depend on the stellar parameters effective temperature , surface gravity and metal content ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , [ fe / h ] ) , and are empirically calibrated on stellar samples . thus synthetic indices depend on : 1 ) the fitting functions ( ff ) ; 2 ) the stellar evolution input ( set of stellar tracks , adopted law for the helium - enrichment parameter @xmath11 , choice for the mass - loss rate , etc ) ; 3 ) the evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) computational procedure .    in the following",
    "we investigate the uncertainties by varying the above input prescriptions .",
    "the si presented here are computed with the eps procedure described in , which makes use of the fuel consumption theorem ( ) to evaluate the energetics of post main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "the input stellar tracks are taken from and from cassisi ( 1998 , _ private communication _ ) . in order to estimate the impact of uncertainties in the ff",
    ", we explore the two independent sets from worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereafter wff ) and from buzzoni et al .",
    "( 1992 ; 1994 , hereafter bff ) .",
    "we selected the indices common to the two sets , namely @xmath12 , @xmath1 , fe5270 and fe5335 .",
    "in addition , the comparison of our models with those of worthey ( 1994 , hereafter wssp ) and of buzzoni et al .",
    "( 1992;1994 , hereafter bssp ) for the same ff , gives us clues on the uncertainties due to the use of different eps procedures and stellar evolution input .",
    "we emphasize that the results obtained in this way provide lower limits for the uncertainties affecting the model indices .    in this contribution",
    "we discuss part of the results obtained in a comprehensive study that will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( greggio and maraston , in preparation , hereafter gm99 ) .",
    "we concentrate here on old ages , that are more relevant for elliptical galaxies .",
    "figure 1 shows the effect of different eps prescriptions ( left - hand panel ) and of different ff ( right - hand panel ) , on the synthetic @xmath12 .",
    "the largest discrepancy due to the eps is @xmath13 mag for @xmath14}\\sim\\--0.5 $ ] for the 15 gyr old ssps compared to buzzoni s models .",
    "when using the @xmath15 index to estimate the metallicity [ fe / h ] of a stellar system , the eps procedure introduces an appreciable uncertainty . in the cases explored here , the largest values are 0.2 dex , for bssp at @xmath16 , and @xmath17 dex for wssp at @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath12 indices in bssp models are systematically stronger than ours .",
    "this is likely due to the use of a different @xmath11 of the evolutionary tracks used in the two eps , namely @xmath19 in bssp and @xmath20 in this work . at fixed stellar mass ,",
    "a lower @xmath21 implies longer lifetimes on the red giant branch ( rgb ) and shorter lifetimes on the horizontal branch ( hb ) ( see ) .",
    "therefore , the indices of rgb stars receive relatively more weight in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . since the rgb is an important contributor to the total @xmath12 ( see gm99 ) , and since @xmath8 becomes stronger with decreasing @xmath9 , an ssp with a lower @xmath21-content exhibits a stronger @xmath15 .",
    "the discrepancies introduced by the different ff ( fig .",
    "1 , right - hand panel ) are relatively small at old ages ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "for the 3 gyr models , instead , wff lead to @xmath12 values which are systematically higher by @xmath22 mag with respect to bff .",
    "this comes from the higher intrinsic @xmath12 given by the wff for the @xmath9 typical of a 3 gyr turn - off ( @xmath23 ) . the largest uncertainty in the [ fe / h ] determination hence appears for the 3 gyr models , with @xmath24}\\sim 0.15 $ ] .",
    "figure 2 shows the same comparisons as in figure 1 for the average iron index @xmath25=(fe5335 + fe5270)/2 . concerning the eps procedure ( left - hand panel ) , the discrepancy to bssp is systematically increasing with metallicity up to 0.4  , with our models predicting @xmath26 stronger than buzzoni s .",
    "again , at least part of this inconsistency likely comes from the different @xmath27 adopted . at @xmath28}>-0.5 $ ]",
    ", the hb phase is spent at @xmath29 , where the fe fitting functions yield the strongest values for the indices @xcite .",
    "it follows that the fe indices are very sensitive to the lifetime of this phase . as mentioned in the previous section , at fixed @xmath2 , a larger value of @xmath21 implies a longer hb lifetime , which in turn determines stronger fe indices .",
    "thus for a given value of @xmath26 our models with bff yield a lower [ fe / h ] , compared to bssp , with a discrepancy reaching 0.2 dex at @xmath28}>0 $ ] .",
    "the different ff ( right - hand panel ) imply systematic differences in the slopes of the relations index / metallicity at old ages . at large values of @xmath26 , bff indices are stronger than those computed with wff ( particularly for the fe5270 , see table 1 ) .",
    "the difference increases with metallicity up to to @xmath30   and mainly results from the different values of the ff .",
    "we finally notice that within the explored range , the largest uncertainty in the metallicity determination due to the use of the two sets of ff amounts to @xmath31}\\sim\\-0.15~{\\rm dex}$ ] at @xmath32 .",
    "the comparison of the h@xmath33 indices from our models with bssp and wssp is shown in the left - hand panel of figure 3 . at low metallicities ( @xmath28}~\\lsim-0.5 $ ] dex ) and old ages ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the h@xmath33 index is much stronger in our computations .",
    "this large discrepancy comes from the typical temperature of the hb phase in the various epss , which is controlled by the assumptions on the mass - loss on the rgb . at a given age ( i.e. at fixed evolutionary mass at the turn - off ) , the larger the mass - loss , the lower the mass of the hb star , which implies larger @xmath9 for the hb phase . in our models ,",
    "the mass - loss is computed using the scheme of with the canonical efficiency @xmath35 , a value calibrated on galactic globular clusters ( see e.g. ) . at 15 gyr and",
    "@xmath28}=-1.35 $ ] , the resulting evolutionary mass on the hb is @xmath36 in our models , while buzzoni ( @xmath37 ) and worthey ( @xmath38 ) use higher values .",
    "we checked our computations comparing the @xmath39 values with those obtained by greggio and renzini ( 1990 ) with the same @xmath40 values , and found no appreciable difference .",
    "thus , in our models the hbs are hotter , which leads to the strong h@xmath4 enhancement , since the relative ff are very sensitive to @xmath9 .",
    "old and metal - poor ( @xmath28}~\\lsim -0.5 $ ] ) ssps predominantly show this effect , while for higher metallicity , and younger ages the evolutionary mass on the hb is relatively large , and the hb remains at low temperatures ( @xmath41  k ) .",
    "however , the @xmath42 of the hb depends on the prescriptions for the mass - loss , and a larger value for @xmath40 would make the hb hotter also at higher @xmath2 ( see e.g. ) .",
    "note that worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) show an analogous effect of the rgb mass - loss on the @xmath43 and @xmath44 indices , as a consequence of a change in the hb morphology with respect to worthey 1994 ( see the caption of their fig .",
    "conversely , reducing the mass - loss on the rgb leads to weaker h@xmath4 indices at old ages / high metallicities , as shown in figure 3 by the model represented as a triangle .",
    "therefore , h@xmath4 is not a reliable age indicator , its value also depending on the hb morphology . since the observed hb in globular clusters very often show intermediate morphologies ( see , e.g. , ) , in gm99 the results for mixed hb will be discussed .",
    "the discrepancy in the synthetic h@xmath4 due to the treatment of the hb phase can be as large as @xmath45 1.5  ( see , e.g. , the bssp case at @xmath28}\\sim -1.3 , t = 15~{\\rm gyr}$ ] ) . at low @xmath2",
    ", this effect implies an age / metallicity degeneracy , with old ssps ( @xmath46 ) having the same h@xmath4 index of intermediate - age populations ( see also ) .",
    "this effect is shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "3 , with the models at @xmath28}\\sim -1.35 $ ] showing a minimum around 12 gyr . concerning the uncertainties introduced by the ff , bff",
    "systematically lead to higher index values for all the explored values of age and [ fe / h ] . for solar and supersolar metallicities , at @xmath47 , models computed with wff predict ages younger by @xmath48 , compared to models computed with bff .",
    "we have shown that current synthetic si are affected by uncertainties that can not be neglected when using these models to derive the age and the metallicity of stellar systems .",
    "these uncertainties originate from the eps procedure / stellar input and from the use of different fitting functions .",
    "the @xmath49 index seems to be the least affected by the different modelling procedures .",
    "the eps ingredient that mostly influence its values is the @xmath11 parameter , in the sense that at fixed @xmath2 a higher @xmath21 leads to a lower @xmath50 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath50 index on the adopted ff is found small at old ages , while for intermediate age ssps wff predict systematically stronger values .",
    "the h@xmath4 index is highly sensitive to the treatment of horizontal branch stars . in metal - poor ssps (",
    "@xmath28}~\\lsim -0.5 $ ] ) , an age / metallicity degeneracy is found , since at @xmath51 gyr h@xmath4 becomes stronger with increasing age .",
    "the sensitivity of this index on the ff is found to be large in all the age and metallicity ranges explored , but especially in the metal - poor regime .",
    "table 1 collects the estimated uncertanties due to different fitting functions , expressed as si(wff)@xmath52si(bff ) , for 3,10 and 15 gyr old ssps and ( @xmath28}=-1.35,0.0,0.35 $ ] ) .",
    "the @xmath53 observational errors ( from ) are reported .",
    "values in bold - face are larger than the quoted observational errors .",
    "no value means a negligible uncertainty ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "there are regimes in which the uncertainty related to the ff adopted in the modelling is appreciably larger than the errors affecting the data .",
    "this happens at high @xmath2 for fe5270 , and at low @xmath2 for the h@xmath4 index .",
    "thus , it appears that uncertainties in the theoretical models should be taken into account when deriving ages and metallicities for stellar systems .    to conclude",
    ", we stress that the estimates reported here are only indicative of the real uncertainties affecting these indices . for example , a subset of ff and ssp models existing in the literature is considered here . besides , variations in the parameters controlling the stellar evolution input of eps ( e.g. @xmath40 , @xmath55/@xmath56 , imf slope , etc . )",
