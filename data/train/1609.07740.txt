    "the progenitors of the h - deficient type ibc sne have , however , proved difficult to detect .",
    "stellar evolution models predict that the progenitors for these types of sne are either very massive single stars ( @xmath7 ) , which undergo extreme levels of mass loss during phases as luminous blue variables and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( removing their outer hydrogen layers ) , and lower mass stars in binaries , which are stripped of their outer hydrogen layers by mass transfer onto a binary companion . the progenitors for these types of sne are expected to be blue , compact stars with high effective temperatures .",

    "while some analyses of the properties of the pre - explosion progenitor candidate suggest a possible single massive progenitor star , other studies of the pre - explosion source and models of the properties of the sn light curve are all consistent with a lower mass progenitor that was stripped through interaction with a binary companion .",

    "we use the padova isochrones . for the comparison of the observed data with isochrones ,",

    "the mass is treated as a nuisance parameter and is also marginalised over .",
    "+ the likelihood function is defined with the observed photometry in each filter compared directly to the predicted magnitudes from the isochrones .",
    "rather than comparing the observed photometry with isochrones in the colour - magnitude plane , our approach specifically avoids complications associated with correlated uncertainties that arise in using colours , but necessitates the explicit use of the distance modulus as a nuisance parameter @xcite .",
    "the likelihood takes the form : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the @xmath72th _ apparent _ magnitude for star @xmath52 and @xmath73 is the _ absolute _ magnitude predicted for a star with mass @xmath58 lying on an ischrone with age @xmath54 and extinction @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , if the star is not detected in a given filter the corresponding detection limit ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ; see section [ sec : obs ] ) can be substituted into the likelihood expression as : @xmath76 this enables us to consider photometry covering a wide wavelength range that may be partially incomplete .",

    "this is likely to provide an incomplete representation of the observed properties of a given stellar population , if a proportion of the observed sources are unresolved binaries with colours that deviate from single star isochrones due to the composite nature of their seds . in order to consider the role of binarity on the observed stellar population",
    ", we adopt the approximation that the observed brightness and colours of a binary system arise from the simple addition of flux from two single stars that lie on the same isochrone .",
    "this approximation is , however , only valid for non - interacting binaries , for which the evolution of the two stars proceeds independently , which in some cases may have significant flaws @xcite . we assign the mass @xmath58 to describe the mass of the primary star , and introduce an additional nuisance parameter @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 ) to define the binary mass ratio ( for which we assume a flat prior ) . for each point along the isochrone we consider the magnitudes resulting from the sum of fluxes from a star with mass @xmath58 at that point and a secondary with mass equal or less than @xmath58 . in the equivalent form of equation [ eqn : post ] , for the binary star scenario",

    "this issue becomes more problematic if the constituent stars arise from a spread of population characteristics . in the bayesian context",

    "despite the lack of a detection of a progenitor in pre - explosion images , the nature of the progenitor of sn 2007gr is particularly intriguing given the classification of the sn as a type ic sn and the location of the sn at almost the centre of a dense young , massive star association and in close proximity to a star as massive as @xmath43 . from the wfc3 and wfpc2 observations there is immediate support for the hypothesis that sn 2007gr resulted from a wolf - rayet progenitor that was an initially massive star .",
    "sn 2007gr is an important type ic sn , principally because of the proximity of its host galaxy which resulted in a detailed photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite reported that sn 2007gr also hosted a relativistic outflow , that might imply sn 2007gr had a connection with the gamma ray burst phenomenon .",
    "using further x - ray and radio observations of sn 2007gr , @xcite robustly disagree with the previous conclusions and find sn 2007gr to only be expanding at trans - relativistic ( @xmath144c ) velocities .",
    "sn 2007gr is extraordinary for its very prompt radio peak in luminosity which , in comparison with the compilation of observations of type ii ( including iip , iin and iil ) and type ib / c sne compiled by @xcite , implies high blast wave speeds that are only compatible with compact progenitors such as wr stars .",
    "based on previous hst observations of the site of sn 2007gr , @xcite and @xcite have presented mass estimates based on ages determined from the sed of source a under the assumption that it was a cluster .",
    "based on the high - resolution hst images presented here , we find source a is consistent with a point stellar - like source , and not a cluster ; hence , the previously derived masses for the progenitor are based on an assumption that we propose to be flawed . from a census of the ejecta , conducted using nebular phase spectroscopy of sn 2007gr , @xcite calculated that the supernova resulted from the explosion of a relatively low mass star with @xmath145 .",
    "this is at the lower limit for the masses we estimate for the progenitor from the age of the surrounding stellar population . given the radically different nature of the two approaches , the source of the discrepancy between our mass estimate for the progenitor and the estimate presented by @xcite is unclear .",
    "@xcite used integral field spectroscopy of knots of @xmath146 emission surrounding the site of sn 2007gr to estimate an age for the progenitor in the range of @xmath147 using the equivalent width of @xmath146 as a proxy for the age .",
    "the reported age range is consistent with the age for the stellar population found here .",
    "@xcite note , however , that given the limitations of the seeing conditions of the observations , individual sources in the vicinity of the sn were not resolved .",
    "previously @xcite discussed a continuum subtracted @xmath146 image of the site of sn 2007gr acquired on 2005 january 13 with the wide field camera ( wfc ) of the isaac newton telescope ( int ) . on figure",
    "[ fig : disc : halpha ] , we show contours corresponding to @xmath146 emission over the late - time wfc3/uvis f336w observation . despite the significant difference in spatial resolution between the two images ,",
    "it is clear that the site of sn 2007gr and the centre of the massive star association are not associated with significant @xmath146 emission .",
    "this has important consequences for the use of the @xmath146 equivalent width as an age proxy , since the sn position may itself not be associated with any @xmath146 emission .",
    "the use of pixel statistics to assess the proximity of sn positions with tracers of star formation ( e.g. @xmath146 emission ; for a review see @xcite ) may also be undermined by the use of low resolution ground based imaging which , as in the case of sn 2007gr , might correlate @xmath146 emission with a sn , where there is actually no association ; further reinforcing the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "this highlights the fact that weak association with @xmath146 emission does not immediately imply a low mass progenitor .",
    "+ here , we have used observations of the surrounding stellar population covering a large wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the near - infrared .",
    "the observations , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd : wfc3 ] and [ fig : cmd : wfpc2 ] , probe a large section of the main sequence of massive stars , as well as a small number of stars that have evolved off the main sequence .",
    "the only requirement of this analysis is that the unseen progenitor is drawn from the same underlying distributions as the observed population of stars .",
    "previously , studies of the ages of resolved stellar populations associated with the sites of ccsne have concentrated on the nearby population within a radius of @xmath148 , under the assumption that stars in such proximity will be effectively co - eval with the progenitor , while at the same time limiting contamination from the background population @xcite .",
    "we have not placed a strict radius constraint on the size of the region associated with sn 2007gr , except by eye constraining the size of the massive star association to @xmath149 .",
    "the bayesian analysis presented here permits us to include as many additional populations as required to fit the observed data .",
    "in addition , a background stellar population could also be treated as an additional mixture component , described by stars away from the central region of interest .",
    "we have approximately estimated the spatial extent of the massive stellar population with which sn 2007gr is associated to have a diameter of @xmath150 .",
    "the ages we have derived from the wfpc2 and wfc3 observations are significantly shorter than the expected sound crossing for a single cloud of this size ( @xmath151 * ? ? ?",
    "there are , however , massive star complexes that cover large spatial scales in the galaxy , that have small age spreads that are also incompatible with the expected sound crossing times . by comparison (",
    "* and references therein ) studied the ob association u sco , which has an approximate spatial extent of @xmath152 , and found the stellar population could be described by a single age of 5 myr , without any significant age spread , implying a single burst of star formation .",
    "@xcite suggested that star formation was triggered by a sn shock wave .",
    "although u sco has smaller dimensions than the massive star association in ngc 1058 , it does illustrate that such large structures with small age spreads can exist .",
    "conversely , if the constituent stars of the association were formed in a single location , velocity dispersions of only @xmath153 would be required to reproduce the observed spatial distribution of stars in the lifetime of the young age solution .",
    "it is also worth contrasting the dense environment in which the , apparently , massive progenitor of sn  2007gr resides , compared to the relatively sparse neighbourhood of sn 2002ap , for which deep pre - explosion images ruled out all single massive progenitor scenarios @xcite .    an important factor not included in our bayesian treatment is the possibility of differential extinction .",
    "we have assumed that the stars that make up the two observed populations share the same , single valued reddening .",
    "we note that , similarly to the differences in age inferred from the wfc3 and wfpc2 observations , the difference in wavelength coverage may be behind the difference in extinction ; with observations in the uv more heavily affected by reddening , than the corresponding redder wfpc2 observations . if the extinction for each star arises from a distribution of extinctions , rather than a single value , this could also be implemented using an hierarchical scheme .",
    "care , however , would need to be taken to avoid any biases introduced due to the requirement that @xmath154 .",
    "it is expected that the inclusion of differential reddening would make the age distributions narrower ; as a single isochrone could accommodate a larger range of colours , than under the assumption of a single value for the extinction",
    ".    such analysis of the host environments of sne , as presented here , has been previously employed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for estimating the progenitor masses for ccsne .",
    "@xcite found that for the type iip sne in their sample they were able to achieve similar estimates for the median mass as those derived directly for the progenitor in pre - explosion images ; as was also achieved by @xcite from their analysis of the population surrounding the type iib sn 2011dh .",
    "although , as evidenced by figure [ fig : res : mass ] , there are large uncertainties associated with this approach , the case of sn 2007gr does highlight that the lack of a detection of a progenitor in pre - explosion images does not imply a low mass .",
    "@xcite argues that the lack of detection of progenitors of high mass stars ( @xmath155 ) suggests that these stars may not be exploding at all as sne , but rather collapsing to form black holes .",
    "caution is required in drawing such a conclusion as there are a number of major issues concerning the analysis of the pre - explosion detections of the progenitors of ccsne that have yet to be resolved .",
    "a fundamental problem in the consideration of the ensemble of progenitor detections and non - detections in a statistical context is that it is unclear how the , generally poor , quality of available pre - explosion observations effectively censors the underlying distribution of sn progenitors . in the case of the pre - explosion observations of sn 2007gr , consisting of shallow wfpc2 f450w and f814w images",
    ", it was not surprising that a possible wolf - rayet progenitor might not be detected @xcite .",
    "we used the seds ofwrh / powr / powrgrid1.html ] ( over a temperature range of @xmath156 and transformed radius of @xmath157 ) to probe the sensitivity of the pre - explosion observations ( see section [ sec : res : location ] ) to a wc progenitor . using the extinction estimate for the host stellar population determined here ,",
    "the minimum luminosity that might yield a detectable progenitor ( @xmath158 ) in the pre - explosion observations is @xmath159 .",
    "this limit is significantly higher than the luminosities predicted for stars that will end their lives as wr stars and the luminosities derived by for a sample of galactic wc stars .",
    "based on stellar populations associated with sn remnants in m31 and m33 , @xcite conclude that the maximum mass for a star to explode may be as high as @xmath160 . in the absence of pre - explosion data of sufficient quality to detect the progenitors of certain types of sne , in particular those from higher mass stars , this analysis could play an important role in establishing the fate of those stars that do not lead to progenitors as easy to detect as rsgs .",
    "it is clear from analyses such as this that contextual information about the locations of sn explosions can be just as important as direct detection of progenitors .",
    "indeed , if a progenitor is detected a significant amount of information might be missed by ignoring the stars nearest to it . in studying population of stars associated with a sn",
    ", we may potentially directly probe the physical conditions in which the progenitor formed and in which its entire evolution took place ; to which some observational proxies ( such as @xmath146 emission equivalent width ) might be insensitive in individual cases , only providing insight for a large statistical sample .",
