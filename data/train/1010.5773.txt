    "some time ago horn and weinstein@xcite proposed a systematic nonperturbative technique for the calculation of ground  state expectation values of arbitrary operators .",
    "it is based on the well  known expansions in terms of cumulants or semi  invariants@xcite of quantum  mechanical expectation values in which the exponential operator @xmath0 takes place .",
    "although the theoretical results are rigorous there remains the practical problem of summing the resulting @xmath1expansion in order to obtain the desired expectation value in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "they resorted to pad approximants and later stubbins@xcite proposed other ways of extrapolating the @xmath1series .",
    "however , those results were not encouraging .",
    "cioslowski@xcite proposed a clever extrapolating technique based on a series of exponential functions and derived an appealing expression that has become popular as the connected  moments expansion ( cmx ) .",
    "later knowles@xcite derived a more systematic way of obtaining the cmx .",
    "the cmx results on the h@xmath3 molecule appeared quite promising ; however it seems that the promised test of the cmx on multideterminant wave functions@xcite has never been published .",
    "knowles@xcite showed that although the initial terms of the cmx recover a large fraction of the correlation energy in molecular calculations , subsequent terms converge to an incorrect energy .",
    "the cmx is quite appealing because it provides approximate values for the ground ",
    "state energy of a quantum system directly in terms of a finite number of connected moments",
    ". this may be the reason why the cmx and its variants@xcite were applied to several simple physical problems@xcite in spite of its limitations@xcite .    in order to overcome some of the drawbacks of the cmx",
    "several authors have proposed alternative strategies like the generalized moment expansion ( gmx ) @xcite .",
    "bartashevich@xcite proposed the connected  moments polynomial approach that yields approximate eigenvalues for all states as roots of a simple polynomial function of the energy with coefficients that depend on the moments of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "this approach was later proved to be equivalent to the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational method@xcite in the krylov space@xcite that we will call rrk from now on . numerical experiments proved that the rrk converges more smoothly and is therefore more reliable than the cmx when both methods are applied to the simple models so far chosen for testing the latter@xcite .",
    "some time ago fessatidis et al@xcite applied the cmx and one of its variants , the alternative moments expansion ( amx ) , to a non  trivial problem with many physical applications : the rabi hamiltonian . because they only considered low order expansions",
    "there is no clear indication about the convergence of the moments expansions for that important model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the convergence of the cmx for the rabi hamiltonian numerically .",
    "such analysis requires moments expansions of sufficiently large order for different values of the model parameters .",
    "we expect that the conclusions drawn for the rabi hamiltonian may be of utility for future applications of the cmx and its variants to more realistic physical problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : rabi ] we introduce the rabi hamiltonian and discuss the diagonalization of its matrix in an appropriate basis set ; in section [ sec : cumulant ] we outline the @xmath1expansion ; in section  [ sec : cmx ] we outline the main equations of the cmx and compare its results with those obtained by means of the rrk and the accurate diagonalization . finally in section",
    "[ sec : comments ] we draw conclusions .",
    "the rabi hamiltonian is a model of a two level atom or spin system coupled to a single  mode bosonic field given by the hamiltonian operator @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the well known pauli matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the physical parameters that determine the spectrum in absence of coupling , and @xmath8 is the coupling between the atom and the bosonic field . when @xmath9 the spin and bosonic degrees of freedom decouple and the problem is exactly solvable .",
    "for this reason it is expected that any approach yields better results for small values of @xmath8 .",
    "recently pan and coworkers  @xcite have shown that the rabi hamiltonian can be solved almost exactly using a progressive diagonalization scheme .",
    "although this model is not exactly solvable for @xmath10 , one can easily obtain highly accurate numerical results by , for example , straightforward diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in an appropriate basis set .",
    "since we will need such results in our analysis of the performance of the cmx , we proceed to describing the diagonalization procedure .",
    "the hilbert space for this problem is spanned by a basis set of states given by the direct product of the spin and bosonic ones .",
    "we label them in the following way : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 $ ] means integer part of @xmath14 .    the calculation of the matrix elements of the operators that are relevant for the model is straightforward ; for example : @xmath15 } & , & \\left [ \\frac{n-1}{2}\\right ] = \\left [ \\frac{m-1}{2}\\right ] -1 \\\\ 0 & , & otherwise \\end{array } \\right .",

    "\\ ,   \\label{eq : mat_el}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and those for @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the hermitian conjugates of the matrices for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the matrix for the rabi hamiltonian follows from obvious straightforward products of those matrices",
    "if we restrict the space to the first @xmath20 states then we obtain an @xmath21 matrix @xmath22 that we can diagonalize numerically in order to obtain approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the calculation is greatly facilitated by the fact that the matrix @xmath23 is _ sparse _ ; i.e. most its matrix elements are zero .",
    "this property is quite useful from a computational point of view because it allows one to save computer memory .",
    "fig.[fig_1 ] shows a simple graphical representation of the matrix @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is worth noting that the truncation of the hilbert space preserves the symmetry of the problem determined by the commutation of the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( the corresponding matrices also commute ) .     and",
    "@xmath26 , with @xmath24.,width=226 ]    table [ tab1 ] shows the ground  state energy of the rabi hamiltonian for several values of @xmath20 and for the same set of parameters chosen by bishop et al@xcite .",
    "present results are more accurate than those obtained earlier and will be a useful benchmark for the investigation of the convergence properties of the cmx . we have calculated the matrix @xmath23 analytically in terms arbitrary model parameters so that we do not have to calculate it again each time that we decide to modify those parameters .",
    "this strategy makes the calculation quite efficient .",
    "we have calculated the lowest eigenvalues of the matrices by iterative application of the conjugate gradient method ( cgm ) to the numerical matrix @xmath23 .",
    "notice that our results are fully converged for a @xmath30 matrix , except in the last case considered where just the last digit is not correct .",
    ".ground state energy of the rabi hamiltonian for specific values of the parameters .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for concreteness , in this section we outline the main ideas behind the so  called @xmath1expansion ( or cumulant expansion)@xcite . the moment  generating function @xmath31 gives us the moments @xmath32 of the hamiltonian operator @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a properly chosen trial state .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath33 in the state @xmath35 @xmath36 exhibits several interesting properties : first , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the ground  state energy , second , @xmath39 and , third , @xmath40 provided that the overlap between @xmath34 and the ground state @xmath41 is nonzero .",
    "the function @xmath42 is closely related to the cumulant function @xmath43 defined by @xmath44.@xcite the formal taylor series of @xmath42 about @xmath45 yields the @xmath1expansion : @xmath46 where the cumulant coefficients ( or connected moments ) @xmath47 can be easily obtained from the recurrence relation @xmath48 the main advantage of the methods based on the cumulant or connected  moments expansion is that they are size extensive@xcite .",
    "any practical application of this method requires a suitable extrapolation of the @xmath1expansion ( [ eq : t - exp ] ) to @xmath2 in order to obtain @xmath49 .",
    "this is not a simple task and different extrapolation techniques may lead to different results . as we have already mentioned before the first application of the @xmath1expansion",
    "was based on pad approximants that provide the simplest and most straightforward strategy@xcite . at this point",
    "we want to point out a common misconception about the theorem of horn and weinstein@xcite .",
    "many authors state that the function ( [ eq : t - exp ] ) converges for @xmath2@xcite which is not the case as one can easily verify . for some complex values of @xmath1",
    "the function @xmath50 may vanish and therefore the @xmath1expansion converges for @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the singular point of @xmath42 closest to the origin in the complex @xmath1plane .",
    "this fact has already been discussed by witte and shankar@xcite and one may easily convince oneself that it is so by means of the exactly solvable two  dimensional model discussed by knowles@xcite .",
    "note that the expansion in terms of exponential functions of @xmath1 @xmath53 which is the basis of the cmx@xcite , does not take into account the singular points of @xmath42 and therefore the matching of the @xmath1expansion is only valid for @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely that we can successfully extrapolate the expression ( [ eq : exp - exp ] ) thus derived to the limit @xmath55 .",
    "regardless of which extrapolation scheme we may use , it is clear that the application of the theorem proved by horn and weinstein requires the calculation of a certain number of connected moments of the hamiltonian . for problems of great complexity , such as for example",
    "body or quantum field theory problems , it may be quite difficult ( or even impossible ) to carry out this task for sufficiently large ( or even modest ) orders .",
    "in such cases one should therefore rely on the extrapolation of the expansion with a few connected moments .",
    "it is not easy to prove the accuracy of such extrapolations in the general case , and for this reason it is useful to verify what happens in the case of a simple though non  trivial model , like the rabi hamiltonian , where it is possible to obtain large ",
    "order moments and sufficiently accurate numerical results .",
    "we expect that a careful investigation of the convergence properties of the connected moments expansions for this model will then serve as a guide for others in which one can not carry out calculations to such large orders .",
    "we first outline the procedures that we follows for the calculation of exact analytical moments of the hamiltonian . in the first place",
    ", we resort to an @xmath21 matrix representation @xmath23 of the hamiltonian operator , as a function of the parameters of the model . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath56 is even , i.e. that we are working in a subspace of the hilbert space containing at most @xmath57 bosons . if @xmath20 is sufficiently large ( for example , @xmath58 ) we can safely calculate the first ( say @xmath59 ) moments exactly . the effect of the space truncation does not affect the calculation because of the band form of the matrix shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_1 ] )   is chosen large enough , the moments of the hamiltonian in @xmath60 may be obtained exactly . ] . in this approximation the moment",
    "@xmath61 is simply given by the corresponding diagonal element of @xmath62 .",
    "we have also resorted to the coordinate representation and calculated the moments analytically in order to verify the accuracy of the matrix approach just outlined .    in order to calculate the moments we follow fessatidis et al  @xcite and choose the trial state @xmath63 to be the ground  state of the noninteracting hamiltonian ( @xmath9 ) . in this way we can readily calculate the moments of the rabi hamiltonian systematically and analytically by straightforward matrix  matrix and matrix  vector multiplications ( or in the alternative way indicated above ) . to this end",
    "we resorted to the symbolic operations provided by available computer algebra software like mathematica and wrote a code that produces the desired moments and connected moments in a reasonably short time . on the other hand , fessatidis et al",
    "@xcite only derived the first five moments of the rabi hamiltonian , a fact which considerably limited the accuracy of their results as well as the reliability of their conclusions .",
    "alternatively the moments of the rabi hamiltonian may be calculated by representing the hamiltonian operator as @xmath64 and writing the trial state as @xmath65 in this way we can obtain moments of sufficiently large order by straightforward differentiation and integration and compare them with those provided by the matrix ",
    "vector procedure outlined above .    with the purpose of comparison",
    "we show the first five moments calculated in the two ways indicated above : @xmath66 it is worth noting that our moment @xmath67 is different from the one shown in eq .",
    "( 12 ) of the paper by fessatidis et al@xcite .",
    "we have verified that this discrepancy was not merely a misprint so that their results and conclusions may be incorrect .",
    "we will come back to this point later on .",
    "once we have the moments the calculation of the connected moments by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_j ] ) is straightforward .",
    "the first five ones are @xmath68     ( dashed line ) and of connected moments @xmath69 ( solid line ) for the rabi hamiltonian with @xmath70 and @xmath26.,width=377 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_2a ] shows the ratios @xmath71 and @xmath69 for the rabi hamiltonian with @xmath72 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that the ratio of the connected moments exhibits an irregular oscillatory behaviour that suggests that we may encounter difficulties in the summation of the @xmath1series ( in fact , in this case the function @xmath73 proposed by knowles@xcite is not even close to a stieltjes series ) .",
    "in order to apply the cmx to the rabi hamiltonian we resort to the beautifully compact expression for the correlation energy @xmath74 derived by knowles:@xcite @xmath75 knowles@xcite also discussed the following alternative expression for the correlation energy : @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 developed by cioslowski@xcite . these two expressions are not equivalent and yield different series in powers of the coupling constant @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we calculate the correlation energy by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_corr_cmx ] ) that appears to be more accurate and suitable for present large  order calculations .",
    "we have been able to obtain a sufficiently large number of moments and connected moments of the rabi hamiltonian by means of the procedures described above . the square matrix appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_corr_cmx ] ) may be badly conditioned and therefore its inverse may contain large numerical errors unless its elements are known with sufficiently large accuracy .    in this paper",
    "we have decided to compare the performance of the cmx with that of the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational method in the krylov space ( rrk ) . in the latter approach",
    "we choose the nonorthogonal basis set @xmath80 , where @xmath34 is a properly chosen trial state . in this particular implementation of the rayleigh ",

    "state energy @xmath49 as @xmath20 increases .",
    "we have considered the same set of values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 used by fessatidis et al.@xcite in their application of the cmx to the rabi hamiltonian . for each set of values",
    "we have obtained cmx results for @xmath88 that requires up to @xmath89 connected moments .",
    "as we have already mentioned , we do not expect to confirm the results of fessatidis et al@xcite , even qualitatively , because their approach based on only five moments is affected by an error in @xmath67 .    for concreteness",
    "we restrict the discussion to the case @xmath90 and three values of @xmath8 .",
    "the conclusions apply to the other cases as well . in order to compare the rate of convergence of the rrk and cmx we calculate @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the approximate ground  state eigenvalue of the rabi hamiltonian calculated with @xmath93 moments by means of either method .",
    "figures  [ fig : r111 ] and [ fig : r112 ] show that the rrk converges faster and more smoothly than the cmx for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath26 the rate of convergence of the rrk is extremely slow . however , although the cmx appears to give better results at some orders , the great oscillations of @xmath96 render this method rather unreliable as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r115 ] .",
    "those figures look quite similar to plots of @xmath97 vs. @xmath93 and are therefore reasonable estimates of the rate of convergence of the moments methods .",
    "some time ago the moments expansions appeared to be a promising tool for the calculation of the ground  state energy of quantum  mechanical problems of physical interest .",
    "however , some judicious investigations suggested that the moments expansions are unreliable and that in some cases they can even yield wrong results@xcite . in spite of this fact",
    "there is still some unclear and inconclusive investigation on the convergence properties of the moments expansions . with the purpose of adding valuable information to that research we have tested the cmx on the rabi hamiltonian that has already been treated by means of the moments expansions@xcite .",
    "we have calculated moments and connected moments of much larger order than those considered before .",
    "our results clearly show that the cmx is unreliable because the successive approaches to the ground ",
    "state energy oscillate so strongly that one is never sure of the accuracy of any particular calculation .",
    "lee and lo@xcite arrived at similar conclusions for another model although by numerical calculations of only fifth order .",
    "we have contrasted the cmx with the rrk and showed that the latter converges more smoothly from above towards the exact eigenvalues .",
    "it is reasonable to compare these approaches that are based on the same kind of moments of the hamiltonian operator . whereas the cmx provides an approximation to the lowest eigenstate ",
    "eigenvalue of a given symmetry , the rrk yields all the eigenstates  eigenvalues simultaneously because it is based on the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational method .",
    "the main advantage of the connected  moments expansions , namely , size consistency@xcite , is not an issue in the case of simple problems like the one discussed here . in other words : the rrk is preferable to the cmx and its variants in most ( if not all ) the cases treated so far by means of the connected  moments expansions .    in our opinion",
    "most standard approximation methods are more reliable than the moments expansions .",
