    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime is remarkable from different points of view .",
    "the early interest to this spacetime was motivated by the questions of principal nature related to the quantization of fields propagating on curved backgrounds .",
    "the investigation of the dynamics of fields on ads is of interest not only because ads space is a space of high symmetry , and hence exact solutions for the free field theory can be written down , but also because it is a space of constant nonzero curvature , and thus field theory in ads background is not a trivial rewriting of minkowski spacetime field theory .",
    "the presence of the both regular and irregular modes and the possibility of interesting causal structure lead to many new phenomena .",
    "the importance of this theoretical work increased when it has been discovered that ads spacetime generically arises as ground state in extended supergravity and in string theories .",
    "further interest in this subject was generated by the appearance of two models where ads geometry plays a special role .",
    "the first model , the so called ads / cft correspondence ( for a review see @xcite ) , represents a realization of the holographic principle and relates string theories or supergravity in the ads bulk with a conformal field theory living on its boundary .",
    "it has many interesting consequences and provides a powerful tool to investigate gauge field theories .",
    "the second model is a realization of a braneworld scenario with large extra dimensions and provides a solution to the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales ( for reviews in braneworld gravity and cosmology see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model",
    "the main idea to resolve the large hierarchy is that the small coupling of four dimensional gravity is generated by the large physical volume of extra dimensions .",
    "braneworlds naturally appear in string / m - theory context and provide a novel setting for discussing phenomenological and cosmological issues related to extra dimensions . the model introduced by randall and sundrum",
    "@xcite is particularly attractive .",
    "the corresponding background solution consists of two parallel flat branes , one with positive tension and another with negative tension embedded in a five dimensional ads bulk .",
    "the fifth coordinate is compactified on @xmath6 , and the branes are on the two fixed points . in the original version of the model",
    "it is assumed that all matter fields are confined on the branes and only the gravity propagates freely in the five dimensional bulk .",
    "more recently , alternatives to confining particles on the brane have been investigated and scenarios with additional bulk fields have been considered . apart from the hierarchy problem",
    "it has been also tried to solve the cosmological constant problem within the braneworld scenario .",
    "the braneworld theories may give some alternative discussion of the cosmological constant .",
    "the basic new ingredient is that the vacuum energy generated by quantum fluctuations of fields living on the brane may not curve the brane itself but instead the space transverse to it .",
    "randall - sundrum scenario is just the simplest possibility within a more general class of higher dimensional warped geometries .",
    "such a generalization is of importance from the viewpoint of a underlying fundamental theory in higher dimensions such as ten dimensional superstring theory . from a phenomenological point of view , higher dimensional theories with curved internal manifolds offer a richer geometrical and topological structure .",
    "the consideration of more general spacetimes may provide interesting extensions of the randall - sundrum mechanism for the geometric origin of the hierarchy .",
    "spacetimes with more than one extra dimension can allow for solutions with more appealing features , particularly in spacetimes where the curvature of the internal space is non - zero .",
    "more extra dimensions also relax the fine - tunings of the fundamental parameters .",
    "these models can provide a framework in the context of which the stabilization of the radion field naturally takes place .",
    "several variants of the randall  sundrum scenario involving cosmic strings and other global defects of various codimensions has been investigated in higher dimensions ( see , for instance , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , much work has been devoted to warped geometries in six dimensions ( see references in kofi05 ) .    in braneworld models",
    "the investigation of quantum effects is of considerable phenomenological interest , both in particle physics and in cosmology .",
    "the braneworld corresponds to a manifold with boundaries and all fields which propagate in the bulk will give casimir - type contributions to the vacuum energy ( for reviews of the casimir effect see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and as a result to the vacuum forces acting on the branes .",
    "casimir forces provide a natural alternative to the goldberger - wise mechanism for stabilizing the radion field in the randall - sundrum model , as required for a complete solution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition , the casimir energy gives a contribution to both the brane and bulk cosmological constants and , hence , has to be taken into account in the self - consistent formulation of the braneworld dynamics .",
    "motivated by these , the role of quantum effects in braneworld scenarios has received a great deal of attention @xcite-@xcite . however , in the most part of these papers the authors consider the global quantities such as the total casimir energy , effective action or conformally invariant fields .",
    "the investigation of local physical characteristics in the casimir effect , such as expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor and the field square , is of considerable interest .",
    "local quantities contain more information on the vacuum fluctuations than the global ones .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source in the einstein equations and therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field .",
    "quantum fluctuations play also an important role in inflationary cosmology as they are related to the power spectrum . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "pujo05 , the quantum fluctuations of a bulk scalar field coupled to a brane located scalar field with a bi - quadratic interaction generate an effective potential for the field on the brane with a true vacuum at the nonzero values of the field .",
    "in particular , these calculations are relevant to the bulk inflaton model @xcite , where the inflation on the brane is driven by the bulk scalar field . in the case of two parallel branes on ads background",
    ", the vacuum expectation value of the bulk energy - momentum tensor for a scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling is investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , in ref . @xcite the application of the generalized abel - plana formula @xcite to the corresponding mode sums allowed us to extract manifestly the parts due to the ads spacetime without boundaries and to present the boundary induced parts in terms of exponentially convergent integrals for the points away the boundaries .",
    "the interaction forces between the branes are investigated as well .",
    "depending on the coefficients in the boundary conditions , these forces can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "the local vacuum effects for a bulk scalar field in brane models with ds branes are discussed in refs . pujo04,nayl05 .",
    "on background of manifolds with boundaries , the physical quantities , in general , will receive both volume and surface contributions . for scalar fields with general curvature coupling , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that in the discussion of the relation between the mode sum energy , evaluated as the sum of the zero - point energies for each normal mode of frequency , and the volume integral of the renormalized energy density for the robin parallel plates geometry it is necessary to include in the energy a surface term located on the boundary .",
    "an expression for the surface energy - momentum tensor for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in the general case of bulk and boundary geometries is derived in ref .",
    "the corresponding vacuum expectation values are investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the model with two flat parallel branes on ads bulk and in @xcite for a ds brane in the flat bulk .",
    "in particular , for the first case it has been shown that in the randall - sundrum model the cosmological constant induced on the visible brane by the presence of the hidden brane is of the right order of magnitude with the value suggested by the cosmological observations without an additional fine tuning of the parameters .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the wightman function and the vacuum expectation value of the field square for a scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter obeying robin boundary conditions on two codimension one parallel branes embedded in the background spacetime @xmath1 with a warped internal space @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum effective potential and the problem of moduli stabilization in the orbifolded version of this model with zero mass parameters on the branes are discussed recently in ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that one loop - effects induced by bulk scalar fields generate a suitable effective potential which can stabilize the hierarchy without fine tuning .",
    "the corresponding results are extended to the type of models with unwarped internal space @xmath2 in ref .",
    "we organize the present paper as follows . in the next section",
    "we evaluate the wightman function in the region between the branes . by using the generalized abel - plana formula",
    ", we present this function in the form of a sum of the wightman function for the bulk without boundaries and boundary induced parts .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the field square for a general case of the internal space @xmath2 is discussed in section [ sec : vevphi2 ] for the case of a single brane geometry and in section [ sec : phi2twopl ] in the region between two branes .",
    "various limiting cases are discussed when the general formulae are simplified . a simple example with the internal space @xmath7 is then considered in section [ sec : example ] .",
    "the last section contains a summary of the work .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor and the interaction forces between the branes will be discussed in the forthcoming paper .",

    "the phenomenology of this type of scenario has been considered in @xcite .",
    "our main interest in this paper will be the wightman function and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the field square brought about by the presence of two parallel infinite branes of codimension one , located at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we will assume that on this boundaries the scalar field obeys the mixed boundary conditions @xmath43 with constant coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "in the orbifolded version of the model which corresponds to a higher dimensional randall - sundrum braneworld these coefficients are expressed in terms of the surface mass parameters and the curvature coupling of the scalar field ( see below ) .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions on the quantum field modifies the spectrum for the zero  point fluctuations and leads to the modification of the vevs for physical quantities compared with the case without boundaries .",
    "the resulting quantum effects can either stabilize or destabilize the branewolds and have to be taken into account in the self - consistent formulation of the braneworld dynamics . as a first stage in the investigations of local quantum effects , in this section we will consider the positive frequency wightman function defined as the expectation value @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the amplitude for the vacuum state .",

    "we obtain formula ( phi22pllargelamb1 ) with exponentially small interference part . for the modes with masses in the range @xmath405 , the contribution to the vev of the field square",
    "is determined by formula ( phi22plas1a ) with two small factors , @xmath406 and @xmath407 . for small values of kk masses , @xmath408 , and large interbrane distances , to the leading order the contribution of a given kk mode does not depend on the kk mass and the corresponding vev is exponentially suppressed by the factor @xmath409 $ ] . if in addition the observation point is far from the brane at @xmath41 , additional suppression factor @xmath410 $ ] appears and the interference part is mainly located near the brane @xmath41 .",

    "when the left brane tends to the ads boundary , the interference part vanishes as @xmath340 .    as an illustration of general results , in section [ sec : example ] we consider an example of the internal space @xmath194 . using the abel - plana formula , the wightman function for the boundary - free geometry is presented in the form ( [ wfadss1 ] ) , where the first term on the right is the corresponding function for the @xmath5 bulk .",

    "the vevs in this case are obtained from the general formulae in sections [ sec : vevphi2 ] and [ sec : phi2twopl ] by the replacements ( [ sd1psi ] ) and ( [ sd1lambda ] ) . in particular , from the point of view of embedding the randall - sundrum model into the string theory , the case of the bulk @xmath419 is of special interest .",
    "this spacetime also plays an important role in the discussions of the holographic principle .",
    "note that in this paper we have considered boundary induced vacuum densities which are finite away from the boundaries .",
