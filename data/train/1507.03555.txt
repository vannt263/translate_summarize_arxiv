    "in the main body of the paper , a symmetry relation for the green s function [ eq . ( [ greensymmetry ] ) ] played a crucial role in proving the absence of the polar kerr effect . to establish this relation , we argued , first , that a unique outgoing wave solution exists for a given source distribution and , second , that @xmath89 for two outgoing waves @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "[ recall that @xmath107 .",
    "] we formally prove these statements here .",
    "as before , the frequency is assumed to have an arbitrarily small positive imaginary part , i.e. , is of the form @xmath108 .    to proceed further ,",
    "a precise definition of an outgoing wave must be given .",
    "in the main text , we have examined wave propagation in a homogeneous , lossless medium .",
    "based on this , it was argued that shifting the frequency by @xmath96 leads to dissipation , enabling us to select outgoing waves by considering only square - integrable field configurations .",
    "more generally , when the medium may be inhomogeneous , it is unclear how to explicitly describe wave propagation . to account for such cases ,",
    "we take square integrability as the defining property of an outgoing wave .",
    "that is , given that the entire space is dissipative , we restrict to field configurations belonging to the hilbert space @xmath109    in this setting , it is important to ensure that the frequency shift @xmath110 actually introduces dissipation .",
    "we have provided evidence for this but only in the case of homogeneous media . in general",
    ", one should demonstrate that the dissipated power @xcite given by @xmath111 \\equiv   \\mathrm{im}\\big(\\langle\\textbf{e}^{\\ast},\\omega_{{\\mbox{\\scalebox{0.55}{$+$}}}}\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{\\omega_{{\\mbox{\\scalebox{0.46}{$+$}}}}}\\textbf{e}\\rangle+\\langle\\textbf{h}_{\\omega_{{\\mbox{\\scalebox{0.46}{$+$}}}}}^{\\ast } , \\omega_{{\\mbox{\\scalebox{0.55}{$+$}}}}\\mu_{0}\\textbf{h}_{\\omega_{{\\mbox{\\scalebox{0.46}{$+$}}}}}\\rangle\\big)\\ ] ] is positive , where @xmath112{$-$}}1 } \\nabla\\times\\textbf{e}$ ] .",

    "this is different from @xmath115>0 $ ] , which does not rule out the possibility that @xmath115 $ ] vanishes for an `` almost '' square - integrable field configuration , e.g. , a plane wave .",

    "when @xmath119/\\|\\textbf{e}\\|^{2}\\to 0 $ ] , @xmath120 $ ] can be interpreted as the field energy ( see section 2.3 of @xcite ) , which must be positive , i.e. , @xmath120\\ge\\kappa\\|\\textbf{e}\\|^{2}$ ] for some @xmath121 . from the behaviors of @xmath119",
    "$ ] and @xmath120 $ ] , we see that eq .",

    "suppose that there exist two solutions @xmath86 and @xmath87 for a given source distribution @xmath127 , i.e. , @xmath128 .",
    "then we must have @xmath129 because @xmath130 .",
    "it remains to show that outgoing wave solutions exist and that one can integrate by parts without surface terms in eq .",
    "( [ complexsym ] ) of the main text and in eq .",
    "( [ positivity2 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we aim to establish the following : first , that the equation @xmath106 has solutions for all @xmath127 in @xmath131 ; second , that each solution @xmath132{$-$}}1}\\textbf{j}$ ] belongs to a subset of @xmath131 for which the integration by parts formulas we have used are valid .",
    "both statements refer to the properties of @xmath133 as a linear operator on @xmath131 . because @xmath133 is a linear combination of @xmath134 and @xmath78 , we begin by considering them separately .",
    "concerning the permittivity operator @xmath134 , we make an additional assumption for further progress : we require that it is a bounded operator on @xmath131 , i.e. , @xmath135 for some @xmath136 .",
    "this condition can be derived from a reasonable assumption on the electromagnetic response function ; it is sufficient if there exists a positive function @xmath137 satisfying latexmath:[\\[\\label{bound1 }    for all @xmath31 , @xmath139 in @xmath140 and @xmath141 for some @xmath142 .",

    "then , the triangle inequality , i.e. , @xmath144 for all @xmath145 , leads to eq .",
    "( [ epsilonbound ] ) with @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "the transverse laplacian @xmath78 @xcite is an unbounded operator .",
    "the domain of @xmath78 is @xmath147 , a dense subset of @xmath131 .",
    "this is in marked contrast to @xmath134 , whose domain defined analogously coincides with the entire @xmath131 because of eq .",
    "( [ epsilonbound ] ) .",
    "a notable property of @xmath78 is that it is a closed operator , i.e. , if two sequences @xmath148 and @xmath149 converge respectively to @xmath76 and @xmath150 both in @xmath131 , then @xmath76 belongs to @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "[ due to eq .",
    "( [ epsilonbound ] ) , @xmath153 converges to @xmath154 if @xmath155 converges to @xmath76 , so @xmath134 is automatically a closed operator . ]",
    "furthermore , @xmath78 is self - adjoint , i.e. , @xmath156 and @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "next , consider @xmath158 , where @xmath159{$-$}}1}\\equiv \\omega_{{\\mbox{\\scalebox{0.55}{$+$}}}}\\mu_{0}$ ] and @xmath160 , acting on @xmath161 . the triangle inequality and eq .",
    "( [ epsilonbound ] ) give @xmath162 which , respectively , imply that @xmath163 and that @xmath164 .",
    "thus , @xmath165 , and using the definition of a closed operator , it is straightforward to check that @xmath133 is closed .",
    "the adjoint of @xmath133 is defined as follows : @xmath166 is an element of @xmath167 if and only if @xmath168 for a @xmath169 in @xmath131 and for all @xmath76 in @xmath170 , in which case we set @xmath171 .",
    "from the fact that all bounded operators have bounded adjoints @xcite and that @xmath78 is self - adjoint , one can show that @xmath172 .",
    "we now prove that the equation @xmath173 has a solution for each @xmath127 in @xmath131 .",
    "that is , the range of @xmath133 ( or , equivalently , the domain of @xmath132{$-$}}1}$ ] ) defined by @xmath174 coincides with @xmath131 . to see this ,",
    "we first show that there is no nonzero element of @xmath131 orthogonal to @xmath175 .",
    "if such an element @xmath176 existed , @xmath177 for all @xmath76 in @xmath170 .",
    "it would then follow that @xmath176 belongs to @xmath178 and that @xmath179 . consequently , @xmath180 , contradicting eq .",
    "( [ positivity2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath175 has a trivial orthogonal complement and hence is dense in @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ positivity2 ] ) and schwarz s inequality lead to @xmath181 whence @xmath182{$-$}}1}\\textbf{j}\\| \\le \\lambda^{{\\scalebox{0.5}[1.0]{$-$}}1}\\|\\textbf{j}\\|.\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ estimation ] ) implies that given a sequence @xmath183 converging in @xmath131 , @xmath184{$-$}}1}\\textbf{j}_{n}\\in \\mathcal{d}(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{l}}_{\\omega_{{\\mbox{\\scalebox{0.46}{$+$}}}}})\\}$ ] is also convergent .",
    "let @xmath185 and @xmath186 be the limits of these sequences . because @xmath133 is a closed operator , @xmath186 belongs to @xmath170 , and @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , @xmath185 is an element of @xmath175 , i.e. , @xmath175 is a closed subset of @xmath131 . as it is dense and closed , @xmath188 .",
    "knowing @xmath189 , we can justify why it was possible to integrate by parts without surface terms in eq .",
    "( [ complexsym ] ) of the main text and in eq .",
    "( [ positivity2 ] ) .",
    "it suffices to prove that @xmath190 for all @xmath191 . according to parseval - plancherel theorem , the fourier transform defined by @xmath192{$-$}}i\\textbf{k}\\cdot\\textbf{r}}\\ ] ]",

    "hence , all six quantities entering @xmath197 in eq .",
    "( [ byparts ] ) are elements of @xmath131 .",
    "it also follows from parseval - plancherel theorem that @xmath198 for all @xmath199 . then , it is straightforward to verify eq .",
    "( [ byparts ] ) by considering the fourier transforms of the quantities in @xmath197 .",
    "thus far , we have formally proved certain properties of outgoing waves leading to the desired symmetry of the green s function [ eq .

    "extrapolation of our result does not work because , e.g. , @xmath201{$-$}}1 } = o(\\eta^{{\\scalebox{0.5}[1.0]{$-$}}1})$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ estimation ] ) diverges in this limit . to the best of our knowledge",

    "<S> we show that , measured in a backscattering geometry , the polar kerr effect is absent if the nonlocal electromagnetic response function respects onsager symmetry , characteristic of thermodynamic states that preserve time - reversal symmetry . a key element is an expression for the reflectivity tensor in terms of the retarded green s function .    the polar kerr effect @xcite refers to rotation of the polarization of light upon reflection due to a component of the magnetization perpendicular to the reflecting surface . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , it is interpreted as a measure of the corresponding pattern of broken symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> inevitably , a sharp onset of kerr rotation indicates a symmetry - breaking phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> observation of this phenomenon has , indeed , played a crucial role in identifying broken time - reversal symmetry in unconventional superconducting states , e.g. , of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite , upt@xmath2 @xcite , and uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> kerr onsets have also been found in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates @xcite , although they are somewhat rounded and their interpretation less clear .    in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the polar kerr effect was measured in a backscattering geometry . in the linear response regime , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding kerr rotation originates from the ac hall conductivity in the dimensions perpendicular to the wave vector of light @xcite , provided that spatial dispersion ( nonlocality ) is negligible @xcite . for this hall conductivity to be nonzero , </S>",
    "<S> the medium must break time - reversal symmetry and mirror symmetries about all planes parallel to the wave vector @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , given the extremely high sensitivity of the kerr measurements ( @xmath3 ) , it is conceivable that a detectable kerr rotation arises entirely due to spatial dispersion effects in a medium with zero hall conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> an important question is whether the symmetry requirements discussed in the previous paragraph carry over even if spatial dispersion is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the mirror symmetries must be broken in any case . </S>",
    "<S> the sense of kerr rotation is reversed in a mirror parallel to the wave vector , so if the system is invariant under this mirror reflection , the kerr angle must vanish . </S>",
    "<S> consequences of time - reversal symmetry are more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> kerr rotation is typically described by the macroscopic maxwell equations which are not invariant under time reversal in the presence of dissipation , even if there is no broken time - reversal symmetry per se .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , there have been proposals @xcite that the polar kerr effect in backscattering can result from natural optical activity @xcite , a spatial dispersion effect , even if time - reversal symmetry is unbroken . in a medium with natural optical activity , </S>",
    "<S> the speed and damping of circularly polarized light depend on the handedness , and it is plausible that this gives rise to nonzero kerr rotation . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the authors computed the kerr angle in the long - wavelength limit , where spatial dispersion is treated to first order in the wave vector , and obtained nonzero results . </S>",
    "<S> several researchers @xcite recently adopted this idea to interpret kerr signals from unconventional superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> yet there were earlier studies suggesting the contrary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they noted that the macroscopic maxwell equations should be consistent with the onsager symmetry @xcite of the electromagnetic response function . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of _ time - reversal symmetry _ and _ thermal equilibrium _ , and holds whether the medium is dissipative or not . in the long - wavelength limit </S>",
    "<S> , this consideration leads to electromagnetic boundary conditions ( at the boundary of the reflecting medium ) different from the ones used in the studies that found nonzero kerr rotation @xcite . the kerr angle computed with these modified boundary conditions vanishes </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there were arguments that did not rely on the long - wavelength approximation but reached the same conclusion @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the significance of onsager symmetry has been re - emphasized in a number of recent papers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to the retraction @xcite of the proposals that various measured kerr signals are due to optical activity alone .    still , as far as we know , the consequences of onsager symmetry have not been fully clarified . </S>",
    "<S> one should be able to see how it constrains the reflectivity tensor in such a way that kerr rotation is forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> however , existing results , if not relying on the long - wavelength limit , either bypass dealing with the reflectivity tensor @xcite or take the principle of optical reciprocity @xcite as the fundamental postulate @xcite , but this principle really should be derived from the onsager symmetry of the response functions . </S>",
    "<S> the main obstacle is that without an approximation , there is no obvious way to express the reflectivity tensor in terms of the ( nonlocal ) response function of the scattering medium . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we avoid this difficulty by expressing the reflectivity tensor in terms of the retarded green s function of the electromagnetic wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> then , it can be shown that the symmetry of the response function is inherited by the green s function and , hence , by the reflectivity tensor . from this , we demonstrate , in the framework of nonlocal electrodynamics , that onsager symmetry leads to optical reciprocity in reflection @xcite and , as a special case , the absence of the polar kerr effect in backscattering .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering the problem of light reflection from an arbitrary linear scattering medium . without loss of generality , </S>",
