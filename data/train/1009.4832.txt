    "this work is a continuing study of the central region of mrk1066 using gemini s near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) observations in the j and k@xmath14 bands . in (",
    "* hereafter 1 ) , we presented maps for the emission - line flux distribution and ratios and discussed the gas excitation and extinction , as well as the origin of the nuclear continuum .",
    "the main results of 1  are : ( i ) the line emission in the near - ir lines is extended over the whole nifs field ( @xmath0700pc ) and most elongated at position angle pa=135/315@xmath15 , showing a good correlation with the optical  line and radio continuum emission .",
    "[ caviii]@xmath16 m and [ six]@xmath17 m coronal lines are the exceptions , being unresolved at the nucleus ; ( ii ) the @xmath18m/  @xmath19  2@xmath20m/  diagnostic diagram is dominated by values typical of active galaxies ; ( iii ) the reddening map obtained from the /  line ratio presents a s - shape structure with @xmath21 reaching a value of 1.7 along pa@xmath0135/315@xmath15 ; ( iv ) from line ratio maps we conclude that the main excitation mechanism of the 2  and  emission lines is heating by x - rays from the central agn . correlations between the radio and line - emission maps ",
    "stronger for  than for the 2   suggest that shocks due to the radio jet play a role in the gas excitation ; ( v ) the nucleus contains an unresolved infrared source whose continuum is well reproduced by emission from dust with temperature @xmath22810k and mass @xmath23 .",
    "in @xcite we presented stellar population synthesis , which shows that within @xmath22160pc from the nucleus an old stellar population dominates the near - ir continuum ( age @xmath2210@xmath24yr ) , while in a partial ring surrounding this region , the continuum is dominated by an intermediate age stellar population ( @xmath25yr ) .",
    "mrk1066 is an sb0 galaxy located at a distance of 48.6mpc which harbours a seyfert 2 nucleus , for which 1@xmath26 corresponds to 235pc at the galaxy .",
    "previous optical long - slit spectroscopy shows that the high - excitation gas ( traced by the  emission ) and low - excitation gas ( traced by , ,  and h recombination lines ) present distinct kinematics , with the former being more disturbed with respect to the rotation curve observed in the low - excitation emission lines @xcite .",
    "the authors suggest that the high - excitation gas kinematics is due to an outflow driven by the radio jet , which is co - spatial with the extended line emission , along position angle pa=135/315@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a distinct kinematics for the high- and low- excitation gas is also supported by optical integral field spectroscopy of the inner 1  kpc of mrk1066 @xcite . in the near - ir , the emission lines present asymmetric profiles revealed by long - slit observations @xcite .",
    "these asymmetries have been interpreted has being originated in the same outflowing gas component observed in , while most of the near - ir line emission ( traced by the peak of the line profiles ) may be due to emission from gas located in the galaxy plane @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we use the observations described in 1 to obtain two - dimensional maps for the gaseous and stellar kinematics of the inner @xmath27pc radius of mrk1066 , which allowed us to put additional constraints on the physical scenario for the circumnuclear region of this galaxy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we present the description of the observations and data reduction , sec .  3 presents the results for the gaseous and stellar kinematics , which are discussed in sec .",
    "sec .  5 presents the conclusions of this work .",
    "the j and k@xmath14 bands integral field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopic data of mrk1066 were obtained with gemini nifs @xcite operating with the gemini north adaptive optics system altair in september 2008 under the programme gn-2008b - q-30 .",
    "nifs has a square field of view of @xmath28 , divided into 29 slices with an angular sampling of 0@xmath29103@xmath300@xmath29042 , optimized for use with altair .",
    "the j band observations were centred at 1.25@xmath31 m , covering a spectral region from 1.15@xmath31 m to 1.36@xmath31 m at a spectral resolution of @xmath32 ( from the full width at half maximum  fwhm  of arc lamp lines ) and at spatial resolution of 013@xmath33002 , as obtained from the fwhm of the spatial profile of the telluric star .",
    "the  observations , centred at 2.3@xmath31 m covered the spectral range from 2.10@xmath34 m to 2.26@xmath34 m at spectral and spatial resolutions of @xmath35 and 015@xmath33003 , respectively .",
    "the total exposure time at each band was 4800  s.    the final j and k@xmath14 data cubes , obtained by combining the individual exposures ( which included some dithering ) , contain @xmath04200 spectra at an angular sampling of @xmath36 , covering the central 700@xmath30700 pc@xmath37 of mrk1066 . for a detailed description of the observations and data reduction procedures",
    "as shown in 1 , in the j band we observe the following emission lines : [ p ii]@xmath381.14713 and 1.18861@xmath31 m , [ feii]@xmath381.25702 , 1.27912 , 1.29462 , 1.29812 , 1.32092 and 1.32814@xmath31 m , hi  , the heii line at 1.16296@xmath31 m and the [ six ] coronal line at 1.25235@xmath31 m .    in the  band",

    "the co stellar absorption band heads around 2.3@xmath31 m are also present in the spectra an have been used to derive the stellar kinematics .          in order to obtain the stellar line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvd ) we fitted the @xmath40co and @xmath41co stellar absorption band heads around 2.3@xmath31 m in the @xmath42-band spectra using the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite .",
    "this method finds the best fit to a galaxy spectrum by convolving stellar template spectra with a given losvd [ @xmath43 , represented by gauss - hermite series ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the stellar centroid velocity , @xmath2 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the speed of light .",

    "the ppxf routine outputs the @xmath46 , @xmath2 and the higher - order gauss - hermite moments @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the use of a library of stellar templates , instead of a single stellar spectrum , is fundamental for a reliable derivation of the stellar kinematics . in this work",
    "we have used template spectra from the gemini library of late spectral type stars observed with the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) ifu and nifs @xcite .    in figure[stel_fit ]",
    "we show some fits ( in red ) compared to the observed spectra ( in black ) .",
    "this figure illustrate the fits at four positions : the nucleus ( top - left panel ) , 05  north - west ( top - right panel ) , 05  south - east ( bottom - left panel ) and 05  north - east ( bottom - right panel ) .",
    "high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio ( @xmath53 ) is required to obtain a reliable fit of the observed spectra .",
    "as the s / n decreases with distance from the nucleus , we have replaced the flux at each spatial pixel by the average flux of the 9 nearest pixels , which increased the s / n ratio and allowed us to measure the stellar kinematics at most locations , except for a few pixels close to the borders of the ifu field .",
    "this procedure can be justified by the fact that our data cube is somewhat oversampled ( the pixels correspond to @xmath36 ) , and this average is thus equivalent to use an effective aperture of the order of the psf fwhm ( @xmath54 ) .    in figure[stel ] we present two - dimensional maps of the stellar kinematics .",
    "the central cross marks the position of the nucleus , defined as the locus of the peak of the  band continuum .",
    "the top left panel of fig.[stel ] shows the stellar velocity field , from which we subtracted the systemic velocity , obtained from the modeling of this velocity field ( see sec .",

    "the velocity field shows blueshifts to the south - east and redshifts to the north - west and seems to be dominated by rotation , with an amplitude of @xmath0120and kinematical centre coincident with the position of the continuum peak , within the uncertainties .    in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ stel ] we present the stellar velocity dispersion map , which has a mean uncertainty of 8   and presents values ranging from 30 to 95  , with the highest ones observed at the nucleus . a partial oval ring of low @xmath2 values ( @xmath58 )",
    "is observed surrounding the nucleus at @xmath59 from it .",
    "the bottom panels show the higher order gauss - hermite moments @xmath51 ( left ) and @xmath52 ( right ) .",
    "these moments measure deviations of the line profile from a gaussian : the parameter @xmath51 measures asymmetric deviations and the @xmath52 measures symmetric deviations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 vary from @xmath600.2 to 0.2 with mean uncertainty of 0.03 .",
    "the highest values of @xmath51 are observed from the nucleus to @xmath013 south - east and at @xmath61 north - west from the nucleus , while the lowest values are observed over most of the north and north - east side of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath52 map presents the lowest values at the nucleus , while the highest values are observed in a ring with radius @xmath59 approximately coincident with the ring of low @xmath2 values .",
    "the most commonly used method to measure the gaseous kinematics is the fit of the emission - line profiles by gaussian curves",
    ". nevertheless , the emission lines in mrk1066 present asymmetric profiles at many locations , which can not be well represented by gaussian curves .",
    "we have thus used gauss - hermite series ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the same formalism used to derive the stellar kinematics ( see section  [ stel_kin ] ) in order to obtain a better fit to the emission - line profiles and a more reliable measurement of the centroid velocity ( from the centroid wavelength of the profile ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath10 ) , as well as to obtain the higher order @xmath62 and @xmath63 moments .",
    "each emission line profile was fitted by the following equation @xcite : @xmath64 ,   \\label{ghfit}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the amplitude of the gauss - hermite series , @xmath68 is the centroid wavelength , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the gauss - hermite moments and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are hermite polynomials .",
    "we added a linear component to eq.[ghfit ] in order to fit the continuum under each emission - line and thus the resulting equation contains seven free parameters ( @xmath71 plus two parameters for the linear equation ) , which have been determined by fitting the line profiles .",
    "the fitting of the emission - line profile was done using the mpfit routine , written in idl programing language using the levenberg - marquardt least - squares method , in which initial guesses are given for the free parameters .",
    "more details about the fitting procedure and its implementation can be found in @xcite .",

    "these lines trace the kinematics of distinct gaseous species ( ionized gas forbidden lines , ionized gas permitted lines and molecular gas ) .",
    "these particular lines have been chosen in order to minimize the measurement uncertainties because they have the highest s / n ratios among their species . in fig.[fit ] we show a sample of fits obtained for each line profile at 05  north - west from the nucleus within an aperture of 025@xmath30025 .",

    "although similar to the stellar velocity field , the gas velocity fields are more disturbed .",
    "the most conspicuous feature is more clearly observed in the 2  velocity field : a gradient from @xmath0125   at @xmath005 north - west from the nucleus to @xmath7555   at @xmath005 south - east from it along the pa@xmath0150@xmath15 , which seems to be a compact rotating disc immersed in the larger disc ( stellar and gaseous ) .",

    "this map also shows that these arms  one coming from the east and north - east and the other coming from the west and south - west  seem to curve into the major axis towards the centre into a structure which we have identified with a compact nuclear disc in sec.[gas_kin ] .        in figures  [ h3 ] and [ h4 ] we present the @xmath62 and @xmath63 gauss - hermite moment maps .",

    "the @xmath63 maps present values close to zero at and around the nucleus for all emission lines  indicating no significant deviations from a gaussian in the emission - line profiles . at @xmath2205 from the nucleus approximately along the major axis , the @xmath63 maps for the ionized gas show regions with values @xmath790.15 , which indicate that the profiles are narrower and have broader wings than gaussians at these locations .",

    "the highest  velocities  blueshifts of @xmath60350  and redshifts of 320   are smaller than those observed for . at the highest blueshifts",
    "the emission is dominated by the nucleus , showing fainter emission from the north - west and south - east sides , while most of the redshifts are due to emission from the north - west side of the galaxy . from blueshifts of @xmath85100  to redshifts of @xmath86100  the peak of the emission shifts from the south - east to the north - west of the nucleus along the galaxy major axis , suggesting rotation .",

    "the 2  emission is more uniformly distributed over the whole ifu field , being less `` collimated '' along the radio axis , with blueshifts observed mostly to the south - east and redshifts to the north - west .",
    "this is what is expected if the velocity field is dominated by rotation similar to that of the stars .",
    "nevertheless , it can be noticed that the velocity fields are not symmetric relative to the galaxy major axis ( what should be the case for pure rotation ) .",
    "for example , in the blueshifted channels centred at @xmath87  and @xmath88  the flux distribution curves towards the north , while in the redshifted channels centred at 81  and 142  the flux distribution suggest some curvature to the south .",
    "these regions are marked with arrows in figure  [ slice_h2 ] .",

    "[ stel ] , the stellar velocity field presents a rotation pattern , and in order to obtain the systemic velocity , orientation of the line of nodes and an estimate for the bulge mass of mrk1066 we have fitted the stellar velocities with a model of circular orbits in a plane subject to a plummer gravitational potential , given by    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is a scale length , @xmath92 is the distance from the nucleus in the plane of the galaxy , @xmath93 is the mass inside @xmath92 and @xmath94 is the newton s gravitational constant . although this model is very simple , it has approximately reproduced the stellar velocities in the central regions of other seyfert galaxies in previous studies @xcite .",

    "<S> the velocity fields for all emission lines are dominated by a similar rotation pattern to that observed for the stars , but are distorted by the presence of two structures : ( i ) a compact rotating disc with radius @xmath970pc ; ( ii ) outflows along the radio jet which is oriented approximately along the galaxy major axis . </S>",
    "<S> the compact rotating disc is more conspicuous in the 2  emitting gas , which presents the smallest @xmath10 values ( @xmath11 ) and most clear rotation pattern , supporting a location in the galaxy plane . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a gas mass for the disc of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the 2  kinematics further suggests that the nuclear disc is being fed by gas coming from the outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow is more conspicuous in the  emitting gas , which presents the highest @xmath10 values ( up to 150 ) and the highest blue and redshifts of up to 500 , while the highest stellar rotation velocity is only @xmath0130 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a mass - outflow rate in ionized gas of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the derived kinematics for the emitting gas is similar to that observed in previous studies supporting that the 2  is a tracer of the agn feeding and the   of its feedback .    </S>",
