    "the spin - boson model ( sbm ) , describing a two - level system ( spin ) coupled to an infinite collection of harmonic oscillators acting as the bosonic reservoir , has an extensive relevance to physical systems in condensed matter physics , quantum optics , and quantum chemistry .",
    "@xcite an interesting aspect of the sbm is its quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite from delocalization to localization phases with the increase of the coupling constant @xmath0 , as a consequence of the competition between tunneling and dissipation induced by the reservoir .",
    "@xcite the qpt has been extensively studied by many different methods , including a path integral method under a non - interacting blip approximation , @xcite a variational method based on unitary transformation , @xcite a numerical renormalization group , @xcite quantum monte carlo simulation , @xcite and direct numerical diagonalization in different bases , @xcite a consensus of these methods is that , for the ohmic spectrum , the delocalized - localized qpt is of kosterlitz - thouless type @xcite and occurs at @xmath1 in the small - tunneling limit .",
    "several experiments have been suggested to observe this reservoir - induced qpt ; these include the use of mesoscopic metal rings , @xcite single - electron transistors with electromagnetic noise , @xcite and cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "@xcite        while the physics in the localized regime is easy to understand , the delocalized regime exhibits many interesting phenomena .",
    "@xcite for example , it was found that in the small - tunneling limit the spin dynamics in the delocalized regime shows damped coherent oscillation when @xmath2 and incoherent relaxation for @xmath3 , a phenomenon referred to as the coherence - incoherence transition .",
    "@xcite in fact , the understanding of this dynamical transition and the physics in the regime of @xmath4 are not clear . here",
    "we focus on the delocalized regime and study analytically the ground - state property of the sbm by the variational method .",
    "our starting point is to examine whether a bound state between the spin and its reservoir can form .",
    "this idea is inspired by recent experimental and theoretical developments indicating that the formation of a bound state between a two - level system and its reservoir can induce decoherence suppression of the system in a structured reservoir .",
    "@xcite we find that besides the well - known delocalized - localized transition , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ qpt](a ) , an alternative qpt is observed in the delocalized regime , which accompanies the formation of a bound state between the spin and its reservoir , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ qpt](b ) .",
    "this qpt distinguishes the dynamics of the system from complete decoherence to decoherence suppression when the initial state of the reservoir is a multimode coherent state . in the small - tunneling limit",
    "this qpt happens at @xmath5 , which is compatible with the coherence - incoherence transition point .",
    "figure [ qpt ] also shows the overall phase diagram for the finite tunneling amplitude .",
    "our analytical formulation provides a clear physical picture of this qpt and a unified description of the qpt in the ohmic sbm .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the sbm and its reduction by the variational approach . in sec .",
    "[ ptid ] , the novel qpt occurring in the conventional delocalized - phase regime is revealed . in sec .",
    "[ dcsq ] we study the dynamical consequence of this novel qpt and reveal an interesting dynamical transition at the critical point of the qpt .",
    "finally , discussion and summary are given in sec .",
    "the spin - boson model is defined as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the energy difference and tunneling amplitude between the two spin states , @xmath9(@xmath10 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the @xmath11th mode of the reservoir with frequency @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the coupling strength between the spin and its reservoir , which is further modeled by the spectral density @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the cutoff frequency , @xmath0 is the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath16 is the step function , and @xmath17 classifies the reservoir as subohmic if @xmath18 , ohmic if @xmath19 , and superohmic if @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite in the present work we focus explicitly on the ohmic spectrum , which is experimentally most relevant , and unbiased case @xmath21 .",
    "to study the ground - state property , it is convenient to make a unitary transformation @xmath22 where @xmath23\\exp[-\\frac{i\\pi}{4}\\sigma_y]$ ] and @xmath24 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant , @xmath29 are the raising and lowering operators in the @xmath30 basis , @xmath31 , @xmath32 acts as a renormalized coupling strength , and @xmath33 $ ] is a renormalized factor for the tunneling . following the variational method , @xcite",
    "the transformation parameters @xmath34 can be determined by minimizing the bogoliubov - peierls free energy .",
    "the renormalized factor @xmath35 has been used successfully to characterize the delocalized - localized qpt in the sbm .",
    "@xcite if the tunneling amplitude is renormalized to zero , the system is in the localized phase and the dynamics is trivial .",
    "in contrast , if the renomalized tunneling amplitude is nonzero , then the system is in the delocalized phase , which displays some interesting dynamical behaviors such as damped coherent oscillation and incoherent relaxation . @xcite in fig . [ qpt](a ) we reproduce the delocalized - localized transition for finite tunneling amplitude . note that eqs . ( [ hz ] ) take into account self - consistently the effect of counter - rotating terms in the sbm .",
    "the unitary transformation separates automatically the one - excitation and excitation - conservative transition @xmath36 from the multiexcitation and nondiagonal transition @xmath37 .",
    "it has been proved that in low - temperature and weak - coupling regimes the higher - order perturbation terms @xmath38 can be neglected .",
    "@xcite then the transformed hamiltonian has the form @xmath39 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath40 has the same structure as the well - known  rotating - wave \" hamiltonian in quantum optics , @xcite where the total excitation number @xmath41 is conserved . for this kind of hamiltonian ,",
    "the hilbert space is split into the direct sum of the subspaces with definite @xmath42 . in this situation",
    "one can naively deem that the eigenstate @xmath43 , a tensor product of the respective ground state of the two subsystems in zero - excitation subspace with eigenvalue @xmath44 , is the ground state of the whole system .",
    "@xcite is this always true ?",
    "let us examine the eigen solution of @xmath40 .",
    "the eigenstate of @xmath40 in single - excitation subspace can be expanded as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 represents the bosonic state with only one excitation in the @xmath11th mode . from the eigen equation @xmath47",
    ", one can obtain a transcendental equation of the eigenvalue @xmath48 , @xmath49 if eq .",
    "( [ cd ] ) has a real root , one can claim that the system exhibits a bound state . from the analytic property of @xmath50",
    ", one can find that eq .",
    "( [ cd ] ) has one and only one real root in the regime @xmath51 $ ] when @xmath52 is fulfilled . for the ohmic spectrum , the condition explicitly takes the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the critical point of forming the bound state .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath48 is even smaller than the eigenvalue @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the ground - state energy is @xmath56 this indicates that , with the formation of bound state , the ground state is no longer @xmath57 , but @xmath58 .",
    "physically , such a sudden change of the ground - state structure manifests clearly the occurrence of qpt in the system .",
    "we can readily verify that the neglected higher - order perturbation terms @xmath38 give no contribution in the two eigen bases , i.e. @xmath59 , which means that the neglected term @xmath38 has no impact on such level - crossing - caused qpt .",
    "this in turn validates our approximation .",
    "we can also verify that the eigenstates of @xmath40 in the subspaces @xmath60 actually have larger eigenvalues than @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that the the higher - boson states may not become the ground state .",
    ", as a function of coupling constant @xmath0 . ]    as we know , the unitary transformation does not change the eigen spectrum of the system , so the qpt occurring in @xmath40 also means a qpt in the sbm . at zero temperature",
    ", the nonanalyticity of the ground - state energy is directly connected to the qpt .",
    "the first ( or @xmath61th ) order qpt is characterized by the discontinuity in the first ( or @xmath61th ) derivative of the ground - state energy . to further characterize this novel qpt , we plot in fig .",
    "[ 1st ] the ground - state energy and its first derivative as a function of @xmath0 by numerically evaluating eq .",
    "( [ grode ] ) .",
    "we can see that , although @xmath62 is continuous , its first derivative suffers a sudden drop at the critical point @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that the qpt is first - order , which can also be verified by the fact that the orthogonality of the ground states at two sides of @xmath54 will cause the ground - state fidelity to suddenly drop to zero .",
    "@xcite we also plot in fig .",
    "[ qpt](b ) the overall phase diagram of the sbm in the finite tunneling amplitude . with the increase of the bare tunneling amplitude @xmath8 ,",
    "the critical point @xmath54 increases . in the small-@xmath8 limit",
    ", a lower bound @xmath63 exists .",
    "the novel qpt occurring in the conventional delocalized phase also falls in the valid regime of our approximation , i.e. the weak - coupling regime .",
    "this also validates our approximation .",
    "what is the dynamical consequence of this novel qpt ?",
    "some works have shown that the formation of a bound state in a dissipative qubit system under a rotating - wave approximation is accompanied by decoherence suppression of the qubit .",
    "@xcite this is understandable based on the fact that the bound state , as a stationary state of the whole system , has a vanishing decay rate and the coherence contained in it would be preserved during the time evolution . in a similar manner",
    "we also expect that the dynamics in our sbm here is qualitatively changed with the occurrence of the novel qpt . in the phase without a bound state ,",
    "the dynamics of the system exhibits complete decoherence , while in the phase with a bound state it exhibits decoherence suppression .     under different coupling constants @xmath0 .",
    "the other parameter used here is @xmath64 .",
    "the cases of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are in the phase without a bound state , and the case of @xmath67 is in the phase with a bound state . ]    to confirm our above expectation , we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system , which is usually characterized by the quantity @xmath68 , with @xmath69 being the time - dependent state of the whole system . @xcite we consider the initial state to be @xmath70 which is a product state of the excited state in the @xmath30 basis of the spin and a multimode coherent state of the reservoir .",
    "it is noted that such an initial state is different from the one considered in refs . .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that under the unitary transformation @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where the evolution of @xmath73 is governed by @xmath40 under the initial condition @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the eigenstate of @xmath76 .",
    "the evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath77 of the spin is governed exactly by the following master equation : @xcite @xmath78+% \\frac{\\gamma ( t)}{2}[2\\sigma _ { -}\\rho ' ( t)\\sigma _ { + }   \\notag \\\\ & & -\\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { -}\\rho ' ( t)-\\rho ' ( t)\\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { -}],\\label{mast}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath79+\\delta\\eta$ ] and @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "physically , @xmath81 plays the role of time - dependent shifted frequency and @xmath82 that of time - dependent decay rate .",
    "the time - dependent factor @xmath83 satisfies @xmath84 in which the kernel function @xmath85 connects to the renormalized spectral density @xmath86 . by solving eq .",
    "( [ mast ] ) numerically , we can get @xmath87 $ ] , as shown unambiguously in fig .",
    "we can see that @xmath88 decays to zero asymptotically in an oscillatory way when the bound state is absent ( @xmath89 or @xmath90 ) , while it shows lossless oscillation ( @xmath67 ) once the bound state is formed .",
    "this indicates clearly that the decoherence really can be suppressed in the phase with the bound state .",
    "this dynamical behavior in turn confirms the existence of this bound - state - induced qpt in the sbm .",
    "the sudden transition from complete decoherence to decoherence suppression is a result of qpt occurring in the model itself .",
    "it is the abrupt change of the ground - state structure near the critical point of the qpt that induces the qualitative difference in the dynamics of the sbm .    on the other hand",
    ", a widely studied case is the nonequilibrium dynamics of the spin system when the reservoir is initially in a vacuum state . @xcite it was shown that the dynamics changes from damped coherent oscillation to incoherent relaxation , i.e. the so - called coherence - incoherence transition , at the point @xmath91 in the small-@xmath8 limit .",
    "@xcite as a dynamical behavior , this is of course not a generic phenomenon for any initial reservoir state .",
    "therefore , the coherence - incoherence transition itself does not suffice to deduce the occurrence of the intrinsic qpt of the model .",
    "then what is the physical reason for this dynamical transition ?",
    "we notice that the transition point matches perfectly well with the critical point @xmath54 in the qpt in the small-@xmath8 limit .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to conjecture that the coherence - incoherence transition is also a dynamical consequence of this novel qpt at the critical point @xmath54 .",
    "the different dynamical consequences are actually due to the different reservoir properties .",
    "to the initial vacuum state of the reservoir , the qpt induces the coherence - incoherence dynamical transition , while to the multimode coherent state , it induces the dynamical transition from oscillatory damping to lossless oscillation . the distinctive character of the coherent state eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) resides in that it is a vacuum state for the reservoir part in the @xmath40 representation so that only the two lower eigen subspaces with @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the whole system are involved in the dynamics .",
    "this means that only one of an arbitrary infinite number of modes of the reservoir with one boson affects the interaction with the spin . as a result",
    "the reservoir shows more coherent interplay with the spin and efficiently prolongs the coherence time of the spin , especially when the bound state is formed . on the other hand , if the reservoir is initially in the vacuum state , i.e. , @xmath94 ,",
    "the dynamical behavior of lossless oscillation can no longer appear .",
    "this is because , in this case , the reservoir in @xmath40 representation corresponds to @xmath95 with the total boson number being @xmath96 which implies that a process of a large number of bosons is involved in the dynamics .",
    "such a large number of bosons distributed among the infinite reservoir modes inevitably induces a completely out - of - phase interaction with the spin .",
    "consequently , the lossless oscillation can not occur for the initial vacuum state even in the phase with the bound state . in the phase without the bound state , @xmath97 and @xmath61",
    "are not so large because of the small @xmath0 in this phase . then our results coincide qualitatively with the decaying oscillation in ref .",
    "in conclusion , using the variational method , we have found a novel qpt in the delocalized regime of the sbm .",
    "this qpt separates the delocalized regime into phases with and without a bound state . in these two phases ,",
    "the decoherence dynamics of the spin shows qualitative differences . in particular , if the initial reservoir is in the multimode coherent state , the spin dynamics in the phase with a bound state exhibits a lossless oscillation .",
    "in contrast , in the phase without a bound state , the oscillation will decay completely to zero .",
    "our purely analytical treatment provides a unified microscopic description of the qpt and renders a helpful understanding of the rich physics in the sbm .",
    "further extension of the present work to other spectra is straightforward . as a final remark ,",
    "the dynamics discussed in the present work only involves the zero - temperature case .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss the dynamical consequence caused by this qpt when the reservoir is initially in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xcite however , in this case it is very difficult to obtain the exact dynamics because the initial state involves the eigen bases of all the subspaces with definite excitation number from zero to infinity .",
    "therefore , some approximations are necessary .",
