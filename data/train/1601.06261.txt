    "the theory of bounded subnormal operators was initiated by halmos ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the definition and the first characterization of their unbounded counterparts were given independently by bishop ( cf.@xcite ) and foia ( cf .",
    "the foundations of the theory of unbounded ( i.e. , not necessarily bounded ) subnormal operators were developed by the fourth - named author and szafraniec ( cf .",
    "the study of this topic turned out to be highly successful .",
    "it led to a number of challenging problems and nontrivial results in various branches of mathematics including functional analysis and mathematical physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the case of bounded operators and @xcite for unbounded ones ) .",
    "this area of interest still plays a vital role in operator theory .",
    "the first characterization of bounded subnormal operators was given by halmos himself .",
    "it was successively simplified by bram ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , embry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and lambert ( see @xcite ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) where the assumption of injectivity was removed ) .",
    "the lambert characterization states that a bounded hilbert space operator is subnormal if and only if it generates stieltjes moment sequences ( see section [ n&t ] for definitions ) .",
    "it turns out that this characterization also works for unbounded operators which have sufficiently many analytic vectors ( cf .",
    "* theorem 7 ) ) .",
    "however , it is no longer true for arbitrary unbounded operators ( cf .",
    "* section 3.2 ) ) . recall that subnormal operators with dense set of @xmath2-vectors always generate stieltjes moment sequences ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.2.1 ) ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that subnormal composition operators in @xmath0-spaces , as opposed to abstract subnormal operators , are always injective ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.3 ) ) .",
    "hence , there arises the question whether or not composition operators in @xmath0-spaces generating stieltjes moment sequences are injective ( see problem [ open2 ] ) .    in a recent paper @xcite , we have developed a completely new , even in the bounded case , approach to studying subnormality of composition operators ( in @xmath0-spaces over @xmath3-finite measure spaces ) which involves measurable families of probability measures satisfying the so - called consistency condition .",
    "this approach provides a criterion ( read : sufficient condition ) for subnormality of composition operators , which does not refer to the density of domains of powers .",
    "the corresponding technique for weighted shifts on directed trees worked out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) enabled us to construct an unexpected example of a subnormal composition operator whose square has trivial domain ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    as shown in (",
    "* example 4.2.1 ) , there are unbounded injective operators generating stieltjes moment sequences which are not even hyponormal , and thus not subnormal .",
    "in fact , it was proved there that if @xmath4 is a leafless directed tree which has exactly one branching vertex and if the branching vertex itself has _",
    "infinite _ valency is understood as the number of outgoing edges at @xmath5 .",
    "] , then there exists a non - hyponormal ( injective ) weighted shift on @xmath4 with nonzero weights generating stieltjes moment sequences . up to isomorphism",
    ", there is only one rootless directed tree of this kind , denoted in @xcite by @xmath6 .",
    "a weighted shift on @xmath6 with nonzero weights is unitarily equivalent to an injective composition operator in an @xmath0-space over a discrete measure space ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.3.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2.1 ) ) .",
    "since the directed graph induced by the symbol of such a composition operator coincides with @xmath6 ( see section [ sect - gr ] for the definition ) , it is _ not locally finite_. this raises the question as to whether there exists a non - hyponormal injective composition operator over is _ over _ a directed graph @xmath7 if @xmath7 is induced by the symbol of @xmath8 . ]",
    "a _ locally finite _ connected directed graph generating stieltjes moment sequences , and , if this is the case , how _ simple _ such a directed graph can be , where simplicity is understood with respect to local valency ( cf .",
    "remark [ val1 ] ) .",
    "the present paper addresses both of these questions . taking into account",
    "the simplicity leads to considering directed graphs induced by self - maps whose vertices , all but one , say @xmath9 , have valency one , and the valency of @xmath9 is greater than or equal to @xmath10 .",
    "such directed graphs are described in theorem [ golfclub ] and remark [ val1 ] . in view of part 1 ) of remark [ val1 ] , the situation in which the valency of @xmath9 is equal to one is excluded by an unbounded variant of herrero s characterization of subnormal injective bilateral weighted shifts ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5 ) ; see also ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.2 ) for a recent approach ) .",
    "if the valency of @xmath9 is strictly greater than one , then , by theorem [ golfclub ] , we have two cases .",
    "the first , which is described in theorem [ golfclub ] , reduces to the directed tree @xmath6 , the case studied in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the method invented in @xcite does not give any hope of answering our questions .",
    "in the second case , which is described in theorem [ golfclub ] , the directed graph under consideration has exactly one circuit of length @xmath11 starting at @xmath9 and @xmath12 branches of infinite length attached to @xmath9 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see figure @xmath15 with @xmath16 ) ; denote it by @xmath17 .",
    "the culminating result of the present paper , theorem [ czwarte ] , shows that there exists a non - hyponormal injective composition operator over the locally finite directed graph @xmath1 generating stieltjes moment sequences .",
    "this answers our first question in the affirmative .",
    "regarding simplicity , the only simpler directed graph which potentially may admit a composition operator with the above - mentioned properties is @xmath18 ( the subnormality over @xmath18 was studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.4 ) ) .",
    "however , so far this particular case remains unsolved because composition operators over @xmath18 obtained by our method are automatically subnormal ( cf .",
    "theorem [ drugie1](iv ) ) .",
    "a large part of the present paper is devoted to the study of subnormality of composition operators over the directed graph @xmath17 .",
    "they all have the same symbol @xmath19 whereas masses attached to vertices that define the underlying @xmath0-space are subject to changes .",
    "since the only known criterion for subnormality of unbounded composition operators relies on the consistency condition ( cf .",
    "* theorem 9 ) ) , we first characterize families of borel probability measures ( on the positive half - line ) indexed by the vertices of @xmath17 which satisfy ( cf .  theorem [ cc1 ] ) .",
    "this enables us to model all such families via collections of measures indexed by the set @xmath20 which satisfy some natural conditions ( cf .",
    "procedure [ proceed ] ) , where @xmath21",
    "are ends of edges outgoing from @xmath16 not lying on the circuit ( see figure @xmath15 ) and @xmath22 is the set of all positive integers less than or equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the end @xmath23 of the edge that outgoes from @xmath24 and lies on the circuit also plays an important role in our considerations .",
    "namely , assuming both that the radon - nikodym derivatives @xmath25 ( see section [ sec3.1 ] ) calculated at @xmath23 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , form stieltjes moment sequences and that appropriate sequences coming from @xmath28 are s - determinate , we show that the corresponding composition operator over @xmath17 is subnormal ( cf .",

    "the proofs of theorem [ suff ] and proposition [ eta1 ] rely on constructing families of measures satisfying .",
    "these two results are in the spirit of lambert s characterization of subnormality of bounded composition operators ( cf .",

    "* theorems 9 and 17 ) ( see also theorem [ glowne ] ) that under the assumption that @xmath32 takes finite values for all positive integers @xmath33 , any family of borel probability measures satisfying consists of representing measures of stieltjes moment sequences @xmath34 , where @xmath35 varies over the vertices of @xmath17 . in section [ s4.4 ]",

    "however , this is no longer true if the s - determinacy assumption is dropped .",
    "we show this by using procedure [ proceed2 ] that heavily depends on the existence of a pair of n - extremal measures satisfying some constraints ( cf .",

    "the parallel question of determinacy of moment sequences @xmath34 , @xmath50 , is studied in section [ sec5 ] by using the index of h - determinacy introduced by berg and duran in @xcite .    as noted above , the proofs of the main results of the present paper ( theorems [ drugie ] , [ drugie1 ] , [ trzecie ] and [ czwarte ] ) essentially depend on subtle properties of n - extremal measures .",
    "the question of determinacy of moment sequences is of considerable importance in our study as well .",
    "therefore , for the sake of completeness , we collect in section [ sec3 ] basic concepts of the classical theory of moments and include some new results in this field . using ( * ? ? ?",
