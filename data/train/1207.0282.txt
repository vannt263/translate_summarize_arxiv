    "models for skewed distributions have become increasingly popular in recent years , as they provide a much better fit for data presenting some departure from normality , and from symmetry in general .",
    "many of the proposed models in the literature allow for a  continuous variation from symmetry to asymmetry , regulated by some finite - dimensional parameter .",
    "the success of those skewed distributions started with the seminal papers by azzalini @xcite introducing the scalar _ skew - normal _ model , which embeds the univariate normal distributions into a flexible parametric class of ( possibly ) skewed distributions .",
    "more formally , a random variable @xmath0 is said to be skew - normal with location parameter @xmath1 , scale parameter @xmath2 and skewness parameter @xmath3 if it admits the probability density function ( p.d.f . )",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively denote the p.d.f . and cumulative distribution function ( c.d.f . ) of a standard normal distribution .",
    "besides their many appealing features , however , skew - normal densities unfortunately also suffer from an unpleasant inferential drawback : in the vicinity of symmetry , that is , at @xmath7 , the fisher information matrix for the three - parameter density ( [ hlsn ] ) is singular  typically , with rank 2 instead of 3 .",
    "consequently , skew - normal distributions happen to be problematic from an inferential point of view , since that singularity violates the assumptions for standard gaussian asymptotics and precludes , at first sight , any nontrivial test of the null hypothesis of symmetry .",
    "such a  situation has been studied by rotnitzky _",
    "@xcite , who show that one of the parameters then can not be estimated at the usual root-@xmath8 rate , while the limit distribution of maximum likelihood estimators might be bimodal .",
    "this fisher singularity problem , however , did not hamper the success of skew - normal densities among practitioners , while theoretical extensions were developing into various directions .",
    "azzalini and dalla valle @xcite and azzalini and capitanio @xcite consider multivariate skew - normal distributions resulting from replacing in ( [ hlsn ] ) the univariate normal kernel @xmath5 with its @xmath9-variate version @xmath10 . in the same paper , azzalini and capitanio",
    "also propose substituting an elliptical kernel @xmath11 for the normal one @xmath10 , and replacing the skewing factor @xmath6 in ( [ hlsn ] ) with an arbitrary , possibly non - gaussian , univariate symmetric c.d.f .",
    "the resulting distributions are called _ skew - elliptical_. the class of skew - elliptical distributions is also studied in detail by branco and dey @xcite , based , however , on a slightly different definition .",
    "genton and loperfido @xcite introduce a concept of _ generalized skew - elliptical _ distributions encompassing all previous ones , where arbitrary skewing functions ( not necessarily c.d.f.s , but satisfying c.d.f .- type conditions ) can be used in conjunction with the elliptical kernel @xmath11 .",
    "finally , azzalini and capitanio @xcite ( who also propose the nowadays commonly adopted definition of multivariate skew-@xmath13 distributions ) , then wang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are relaxing the assumption of elliptically symmetric kernels into a weaker assumption of central symmetry , leading to multivariate _ skew - symmetric _ densities of the form @xmath14 \\\\[-8pt ] & : = & 2    \\bigl({\\boldsymbol{{\\sigma}}}^{-1/2}({\\mathbf{x}}-{{\\boldsymbol\\mu}}),{{\\boldsymbol\\delta}}\\bigr ) , \\qquad{\\mathbf{x}}\\in{\\mathbb r}^k,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    a.   @xmath15 is a location parameter , @xmath16 ( throughout , @xmath17 denotes the determinant and @xmath18 the symmetric square - root of any @xmath19 in the class @xmath20 of symmetric positive definite @xmath21 matrices ) a scatter matrix , while @xmath22 plays the role of a skewness parameter ; b.   the _ symmetric kernel _",

    "$ ] satisfies @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath25 .",
    "this definition is the one we are adopting in the sequel . while @xmath30 , in most practical situations , is of the simple form @xmath31 , with @xmath32 $ ] , wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite actually do not consider any specific @xmath33-parameterization .",
    "our parametric approach ( with the regularity assumptions  and  of sections  [ univtale ] and  [ multitale ] , resp . ) is in the spirit of  if not at the same level of mathematical generality as  the differentiable path and tangent space approach taken in the local and asymptotic treatment of semiparametric models ( see , e.g. , chapter  25 of van der vaart @xcite ) .",
    "also , the condition that @xmath23 is a nonvanishing density is not imposed by wang _",
    "_ @xcite ; we are adding that requirement in order to avoid inessential complications related with bounded and parameter - dependent supports .",
    "for further information about skew - symmetric models and related topics , we refer the reader to the recent monograph by genton @xcite , and to the review papers arnold and beaver @xcite and azzalini @xcite .",
    "the issue of singular fisher information runs like a red thread through all those developments .",
    "mentioned , from the very beginning , in azzalini @xcite itself , it is discussed , in the univariate and multivariate skew - normal context , by azzalini and capitanio @xcite , pewsey  @xcite , chiogna @xcite and arellano - valle and azzalini  @xcite .",
    "the same issue has been considered in various subclasses of skew - symmetric distributions .",
    "pewsey @xcite and azzalini and genton @xcite establish that the singularity problem remains after replacement of the c.d.f .",
    "@xmath6 in ( [ hlsn ] ) with any c.d.f .",
    "@xmath34 satisfying mild regularity assumptions .",
    "diciccio and monti  @xcite prove that , within the class of univariate skew - exponential power distributions of azzalini @xcite , the normal kernels are the only ones suffering from singular fisher information .",
    "the same result is shown to hold true for two classes of scalar skew-@xmath13 distributions by gmez _",
    "_ @xcite and diciccio and monti @xcite .",
    "the multivariate counterparts of these statements are provided in ley and paindaveine @xcite , respectively .    finally , the very general ( still a special case of ( [ hlss ] ) , though ) class of multivariate skew - symmetric densities of the form @xmath35 encompassing all previous cases , is considered in ley and paindaveine @xcite , who characterize , for each possible value @xmath36 of the fisher information rank deficiency , the form of the symmetric kernels giving rise to such deficiency . here",
    "again , gaussian kernels are playing a very special role . in the univariate setup and within the subclass of multivariate generalized skew - elliptical distributions ,",
    "only the skew - normal densities are affected by the singularity problem .",
    "although results in the fully general ( for densities of the form ( [ leypaindav ] ) ) multivariate case are more complex , only kernels exhibiting gaussian restrictions on some @xmath37-dimensional linear subspaces can lead to degenerate fisher information .",
    "a tentative remedy to that singularity problem was suggested by azzalini himself who , as early as 1985 , in his original paper , proposes a reparametrization of skew - normal families , the so - called _ centered parametrization _ , under which fisher information matrices remain full - rank .",
    "the multivariate version of that reparametrization is examined in detail by arellano - valle and azzalini @xcite .",
    "that solution , however , never really caught up in practice , partly because the structure of the skewing mechanism , hence of the resulting skew - normal family , under the new parametrization , loses much of its simplicity ( certainly so in the multivariate context ) , partly because of its limitation to skew - normal families .",
    "azzalini and genton @xcite therefore once again emphasize the need for a clarification of the fisher singularity phenomenon in order to `` _ _ remove , or at least alleviate , the necessity of an alternative parametrization . _ _ ''",
    "the objective of the present paper is to provide such a clarification .",
    "while all comments and existing results , in this singular fisher information issue , seemed to be pointing at some special status for normal kernels and , consequently , skew - normal distributions , we completely dispel the idea of any particular role of gaussian kernels . turning to the fully general class of skew - symmetric densities described in ( [ hlss ] ) ,",
    "we show indeed that information deficiency actually originates in an unfortunate mismatch between @xmath23 and @xmath38  more specifically , between two densities , the kernel @xmath23 and an exponential density @xmath39 associated with the skewing function @xmath40 .",
    "a tale of two densities , thus , rather than a gaussian mystery  the paper is organized as follows . section  [ univtale ] deals with the univariate setup , where the singularity problem is simple , as the rank of the three - parameter fisher information matrix only can be 3 or 2 .",
    "the result is derived in an informal way , and some examples of skewing functions are treated in section  [ univexos ] .",
    "a more formal statement of the general solution is provided for the multivariate setup in section  [ multitale ] , along with some examples in section  [ multiexos ] .",
    "final comments and conclusions are given in section  [ fcomments ] .",
    "we start by analyzing the information singularity problem in the univariate case .",
    "to do so , consider the class of skew - symmetric probability density families of the form @xmath41 with @xmath42 , where @xmath1 is a location parameter , @xmath2 a scale parameter and @xmath43 an asymmetry parameter .",
    "the symmetric kernel @xmath44 in ( [ skew1 ] ) is a nonvanishing symmetric _ standardized _",
    ", that is , a probability density function such that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , with scale parameter one  an identification constraint for @xmath47 that does not imply any loss of generality .",
    "classical standardization , with a constraint of the form @xmath48 , involves the variance of @xmath49 with p.d.f .",
    "@xmath23 ; the scale parameter @xmath50 then is the mean squared deviation @xmath51 $ ] with respect to @xmath52 of @xmath0 with p.d.f .",
    "if moment assumptions are to be avoided , one may rather consider , for instance , medians of squares , with an identification constraint of the form @xmath54 : if @xmath0 has p.d.f .",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 then is the median of the absolute deviation @xmath57 , which exists irrespective of the density of @xmath0 .",
    "other quantiles of @xmath57 would enjoy similar properties .",
    "we throughout assume that such an identification constraint , hence a concept of scale , has been adopted .",
    "that choice , however , is completely arbitrary , and any element in the scale family of p.d.f.s of the form ( [ skew1 ] ) with @xmath58 could be chosen as the reference density characterizing unit scale  hence could serve as a symmetric kernel for the same skew - symmetric family .",
    "as we shall see , that choice has no impact on the results of this paper .",
    "the second factor in ( [ skew1 ] ) is a skewing function , namely , a function @xmath59 $ ] such that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "traditional choices involve @xmath64 ( skew - normal distributions , azzalini @xcite ) , @xmath65 ( skew - exponential power distributions , azzalini @xcite ) or @xmath66 for any symmetric univariate c.d.f .",
    "@xmath67 ( skew - symmetric distributions , azzalini and capitanio @xcite ) . the class of skewing functions considered here is much broader .",
    "the regularity assumptions we are making on @xmath23 and @xmath40 are as follows .",
    "[ as1 ] the mapping @xmath68 is differentiable , with derivative @xmath69 such that , letting @xmath70 , the information quantity for location @xmath71 , with @xmath72 is finite .",

    "[ as2plus ] same as , but the quantity @xmath82 moreover is finite .",
    "these assumptions essentially guarantee the existence and finiteness of fisher information at @xmath76 ; the differentiability and integrability conditions could be relaxed into weaker differentiability properties such as quadratic mean differentiability .",
    "this small gain of generality , however , would require a generalized definition of information ( in the le cam style ) , with non - negligible technical complications .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we stick to a more traditional approach and the traditional definition of fisher information .",
    "note that this definition differs from the one , used by some authors , of an _ observed fisher information _ , that is , the empirical value of the matrix of negative second - order derivatives of the log - likelihood evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters .    under assumptions   and  ,",
    "the _ score vector _ @xmath83 , at @xmath84 , takes the form @xmath85 where the factor 2 in @xmath86 follows from the fact that @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "assumption  ( i ) is a mild requirement which , in regular models , readily follows from the fact that @xmath62 , and ensures that the skewing function @xmath40 plays no role in the score functions for @xmath52 and @xmath56 at @xmath76 .    under assumptions   and , the @xmath87 fisher information matrix for @xmath88 exists , and takes the form @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 the zeroes in @xmath92 are easily obtained by noting that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are antisymmetric functions of @xmath95 , whereas @xmath96 is symmetric with respect to the same quantity .",
    "it then trivially follows that singularity of @xmath97 only can be due to the singularity of the @xmath98 submatrix @xmath99 the existence of which , however , only requires assumptions   and . clearly , either @xmath100 is full - rank or , in case @xmath101 , it has rank 1 .",

    "summing up , there exists an orthogonal matrix @xmath310 such that , for any @xmath311 , the density of @xmath312 conditional on @xmath313 belongs to the exponential family with minimal sufficient statistic @xmath314 as was to be proved .",
    "so far , we have formally solved the singularity problem for the @xmath236 information matrix @xmath235 . as in the univariate case ,",
    "the singularity problem for the full @xmath315 information matrix @xmath316 is slightly different .",
    "indeed , the existence of @xmath317 requires the stronger assumption  , as the information for scatter , which is not present in @xmath237 , has to exist as well ; this adds a further condition on the exponential family in proposition  3.1 .",
    "nevertheless , there is no fundamental difference between the two setups : it only could happen that a solution to the singularity problem of @xmath237 is not a solution of the larger problem because the matrix @xmath318 simply does not exist , hence can not be singular .",
    "this explains why , for the sake of simplicity , we state the results of this section in terms of @xmath235 .",
    "the message is clear : the tale of two densities has turned into a more elaborate plot , starring a much larger number of actors .      as in the univariate case ,",
    "we now analyze three concrete examples of skewing functions in the light of the findings of the previous section , which provides the theoretical statement in proposition  [ hlmultisol ] with some further intuition .",
    "the first example is the natural extension of the univariate skewing function @xmath155 to the multivariate context , with @xmath319 , where @xmath320 $ ] satisfies exactly the same conditions as in section  [ univexos ] . the resulting class of skewing functions @xmath321 is the most common one in the literature .",
    "a skewing function @xmath149 combined with a multinormal kernel @xmath322 yields the class of skew - multinormal densities of azzalini and dalla valle  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath23 is only required to be spherically symmetric and the skewing function  @xmath40 is a univariate symmetric c.d.f .",
    ", we obtain the class of skew - elliptical distributions as defined by azzalini and capitanio @xcite , itself a subclass of the generalized skew - elliptical distributions of genton and loperfido @xcite where @xmath40 is left unspecified . finally ,",
    "relaxing the assumption of spherical symmetry into the weaker assumption of central symmetry , we retrieve the popular class of multivariate skew - symmetric distributions analyzed in ley and paindaveine @xcite .",

    "quite nicely , the possibility of separating the vectors @xmath329 and @xmath330 in @xmath331 allows us to express the corresponding exponential densities in terms of @xmath332 only , yielding the @xmath37-dimensional gaussian densities @xmath333 as in the univariate case , the sign of @xmath167 is the same as that of @xmath334 .",
    "degenerate information thus takes place iff , for some adequate rotation @xmath335 of @xmath336 , the @xmath37-dimensional marginal distribution of @xmath337_{1\\ldots m}$ ] is standard @xmath37-variate normal .",

    "in such a case , the conditional distribution of the  @xmath37 first components given the   last ones belongs to the exponential family of distributions just described .",
    "thus , contrary to the univariate setup , multinormal densities are not the only symmetric kernels leading to singular fisher information when combined with the skewing functions @xmath339 .",
    "multinormal kernels , however , are the only ones for which fisher information has minimal rank ( corresponding to @xmath340 ) .",
    "all this is in total accordance with earlier findings by ley and paindaveine @xcite , who examine in detail the singularity issues related to skew - symmetric distributions generated via @xmath339 .",
    "we therefore refer the reader to that reference for more details about the skewing functions @xmath339 , especially so for the special case of skew - elliptical distributions .",
    "our second example corresponds to another classical type of skewing functions , namely @xmath341 where @xmath40 satisfies the same properties as above , and @xmath342 . clearly , as @xmath343",

    "diciccio and monti @xcite prove the conjecture in the univariate case , ley and paindaveine @xcite in any dimension @xmath9 .",
    "proposition  3.1 confirms those earlier results , as ( [ multit ] ) , whatever the value of @xmath167 , can not be derived from a @xmath9-dimensional @xmath13 distribution with @xmath156 degrees of freedom .",

    "the validity of assumption   is immediate , and one also directly obtains that @xmath358 and @xmath359 .",
    "the same reasoning as for @xmath178 readily yields that the natural parameter space related to the exponential family with minimal sufficient statistic @xmath360 is empty , hence skewing functions of the type @xmath361 can be used without worrying about possibly singular fisher information .",
    "in this paper , we fully dispel the widespread opinion that gaussian densities , in the context of skew - symmetric distributions , constitute an intriguing worst - case situation , being the only ones ( possibly , after restriction to linear subspaces ) leading to degenerate fisher information matrices in the vicinity of symmetry .",
    "our main result provides a complete characterization of that information degeneracy phenomenon , which generalizes and extends all previous results of that type , and highlights the link between the symmetric kernel and the skewing function causing singularity .",
    "we also show how that link , in the univariate as well as in the multivariate case , can be described as a mismatch between two densities , in which the gaussian distribution plays no particular role . by avoiding such mismatch , one can deal with skew - symmetric distributions without worrying about singular fisher information and its consequences .",
