    "_ photons are light _ , namely they are massless and , consequently , do not possess a rest frame . therefore , although they are quanta of vector fields of spin @xmath0 , photons have only two independent spin projections along the direction of propagation ( _ helicity _ ) @xcite . in the classical optics realm",
    "this means that at a fixed point in space , there are only two independent directions of oscillation ( _ polarization _ ) for the electric field carried by monochromatic light @xcite . for plane and paraxial waves propagating along a given axis , which here and hereafter will be identified with the @xmath1-axis of a cartesian reference frame ,",
    "such oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation @xmath1 .",
    "if the two components of the electric field have equal amplitude and are @xmath2 out of phase , the light is said to be circularly polarized .",
    "if the amplitudes are not equal , the light is elliptically polarized @xcite .    however , monochromatic electromagnetic waves confined by cavities and waveguides @xcite , strongly focused beams @xcite , plasmonic fields and evanescent waves @xcite , exhibit complex spatial structures and the two independent directions of oscillation of the electric field are not necessarily perpendicular to the propagation direction @xmath1 . in these cases",
    "there is a longitudinal electric field component oscillating along @xmath1 and the light can be elliptically polarized in a meridional plane , namely in a plane containing the @xmath1-axis @xcite .",
    "therefore , the electric field vector can spin around an axis perpendicular to @xmath1 , as a `` photonic wheel '' @xcite , thus generating a transverse spin angular momentum ( am ) density @xcite .",
    "light beams with a longitudinal electric field component are key to many relevant applications in physics and chemistry , such as particle acceleration @xcite , single - molecules manipulation and spectroscopy @xcite , high resolution near - field optical microscopy @xcite , strong focussing of light @xcite and nanophotonics @xcite .    as recently reviewed by several authors @xcite , transverse spin am density manifests in many different forms depending on the specific wavefield configuration @xcite . here",
    ", we establish a general theory of monochromatic light waves carrying transverse spin am density , which permits us to describe different phenomena in a consistent fashion .",
    "we begin with by considering generic optical waves with longitudinal components of the electric field vector . from the study of the dynamical properties of these waves , such as energy , linear momentum and spin am densities",
    ", we find that the last may be transverse in an either global or local sense ; the first or second case occurring when the spin density vector is perpendicular to either the mean direction of the linear momentum of the wave or to the linear momentum density . in both cases ,",
    "we quantify transverse spin am density by means of suitably defined meridional stokes parameters @xcite .",
    "an intriguing and previously unnoticed connection between the theory of complex functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the transverse spin am density of light is revealed by studying the _ maximal _ transverse spin am density occurring along the so - called c lines of the electric field , where the polarization of the electric field is purely circular @xcite .",
    "finally , with the purpose of illustrating our findings , we work out two detailed examples involving non - diffracting bessel beams and evanescent waves .",
    "in order to set the notation and the units used throughout this paper , we now briefly review some notable results from the works of nye & hajnal @xcite , nye @xcite and berry & dennis @xcite .    the observable electric field @xmath3 of a monochromatic electromagnetic wave of angular frequency @xmath4 , can be written as the real part of the time - harmonic complex vector field @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the conjugate radii of the so - called _ polarization ellipse _ centered at @xmath10 , swept out by @xmath3 as time elapses .",
    "the vector @xmath11 normal to the polarization ellipse is parallel to the electric part of the cycle - averaged spin am density @xmath12 , that is @xmath13 where , from now on , a prefactor @xmath14 in front of energy , linear and angular momentum densities , will be omitted .    in a homogeneous plane wave with real - valued wave vector @xmath15 ,",
    "the propagation direction is naturally defined by @xmath15 itself .",
    "such definition is _ global _ , in the sense that the wave vector @xmath15 is independent of the position vector @xmath10 .",
    "however , for any wave that is not simply plane , one needs to specify a _",
    "local _ , namely dependent on @xmath10 , propagation direction .",
    "let us denote with @xmath16 the local wave vector giving the propagation direction of the electric field @xmath17 at @xmath10 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ = & \\ ; { \\mathbf{p}}\\cdot \\left ( { \\bm{\\nabla}}\\right ) { \\mathbf{q}}- { \\mathbf{q}}\\cdot \\left ( { \\bm{\\nabla}}\\right ) { \\mathbf{p}}\\equiv { \\mathbf{p}}\\cdot \\bigl ( { \\overset{\\text{\\small$\\bm\\leftrightarrow$}}{{\\bm{\\nabla } } } } \\bigr ) { \\mathbf{q } } , \\ ] ] where the suggestive notation @xmath19 has been used @xcite .",
    "there is a simple relation between the local wave vector @xmath16 and the cycle - averaged linear momentum of the electric field @xmath20 .",
    "this can be written as the sum of an orbital part , denoted @xmath21 , and a spin part , indicated with @xmath22 , that is @xmath23 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath16 coincides ( apart from the prefactor @xmath14 ) with @xmath21 , while the spin part can be simply defined in terms of the spin am density @xmath12 as : @xmath24 another important dynamical property of the electric field @xmath17 , is its cycle - averaged energy density that can be written in terms of @xmath25 as @xmath26 from this equation and eq .",
    "it follows that , given a fixed value of @xmath27 , @xmath28 is _ maximal _ when @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this case @xmath31 and the wave is circularly polarized .    in many cases of practical importance as , for example , in laser beams , light propagates along a well defined global direction , here and hereafter identified with the @xmath1-axis of a cartesian reference frame @xmath32 .",
    "in such a frame , the _",
    "mean _ value of a dynamical quantity like energy or linear momentum , is defined as the integral of the corresponding density over the cross - section of the beam .",
    "for example , the mean wave vector is given by @xmath33 and , because of our choice of the reference frame , it is parallel to the @xmath1-axis .",
    "a special situation occurs when @xmath34 . in this case",
    "the local and global propagation directions coincide , although the wave is not plane .",
    "we will see explicitly later in what circumstances this happens .    in general , for optical waves that are not simply plane , the dynamical properties and polarization patterns of the electric and magnetic fields differ @xcite . in the remainder",
    ", we will study explicitly the transverse spin am density of the electric field @xmath35 only .",
    "however , all our conclusions keep their validity if we replace @xmath35 with the magnetic field @xmath36 .",
    "this is possible because for monochromatic electromagnetic waves the electric and magnetic fields are `` uncoupled '' , in the sense that the electric and magnetic parts of the electrodynamic hamiltonian are separately time - independent .      in vacuum , in absence of free charges and electric currents , the electric vector field @xmath37 is purely transverse , namely @xmath38 , and satisfies the wave equation @xmath39 .",
    "a plane - wave solution of these equations takes the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the wave vector . here",
    "@xmath42 is the wave number and @xmath43 denotes an either real- or complex - valued unit vector such that @xmath44 , where the `` dot '' symbol between any two @xmath45d vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 , stands for @xmath48 ( no complex - conjugation required ) . when @xmath49 is complex - valued , as in the evanescent waves considered in sec .",
    "[ evanescentfield ] , it can be written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the real and imaginary parts of the unit wave vector , respectively .",
    "in this case the orthogonality condition @xmath44 entails @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 is the angular frequency of the wave and @xmath56 is a three - vector perpendicular to @xmath15 , namely @xmath57 . in our preferred cartesian reference frame",
    "@xmath58 , the condition @xmath57 can be explicitly written as @xmath59 apart from the trivial solution @xmath60 , eq . also admits three elementary solutions of the form @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where one of the three cartesian components of @xmath64 is chosen to be zero .",
    "the first solution @xmath65 generates a plane - wave mode whose electric field is purely perpendicular to the @xmath1-axis @xcite .",
    "the remaining two solutions @xmath66 generate plane waves with both longitudinal ( @xmath1 ) and transverse ( either @xmath67 or @xmath68 , respectively ) components of the electric field and are , therefore , interesting to us .",
    "consider , for example , the solution @xmath69 with @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the electric vector field can be evidently written as @xmath71 as desired , @xmath72 has transverse and longitudinal components of amplitudes @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , but it does not possess yet the structure of a photonic wheel because from eq . it follows that the observable electric field @xmath75 simply oscillates along the direction @xmath76 and does not rotate .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 propagates in the direction of @xmath15 which , in general , is not parallel to the @xmath1-axis . in fact , @xmath77 to remove this problem , we notice that propagation along the @xmath1-axis can be simply achieved by taking the sum of two plane waves @xcite that are _ mirror - symmetric _ with respect to the @xmath1-axis , namely @xmath78 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\ ; \\times \\exp(-i \\omega t)\\nonumber \\\\ = & \\ ; \\left (   \\zeta \\ , \\hat{\\mathbf{y } } - i \\eta \\ , \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\right )   \\exp(i k_z z - i \\omega t ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 . as byproduct of this choice , we automatically get a @xmath2 phase difference between the transverse and the longitudinal components of @xmath72 , which ensures the rotation of the field in the meridional plane @xmath82",
    ". moreover , the exponential factor @xmath83 shows that @xmath72 effectively propagates along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "therefore , both conditions required for the existence of a photonic wheel field configuration are satisfied .",
    "a straightforward calculation reveals that , as expected , the spin am density carried by @xmath84 is transverse , @xmath85 and that the local wave vector is purely longitudinal , @xmath86 as desired .",
    "a similar reasoning can be repeated for the field obtained by replacing @xmath87 with @xmath88 in eq . .",
    "in this case we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath91 if @xmath92 ( the two plane waves lay on the @xmath93-plane ) and @xmath94 if @xmath95 ( the two plane waves lay on the @xmath82-plane ) . this is a direct consequence of the transverse nature of electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , _",
    "arbitrary _ transverse orientation of @xmath12 may be achieved by superimposing , for a given wave vector @xmath15 , the fields @xmath84 and @xmath96 , to obtain @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "it is not hard to show that in this case we have @xmath99 { \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}. \\end{split } \\ ] ]      from eq .",
    "it follows that the polarization ellipse centered at @xmath10 and swept out by @xmath100 $ ] , is located on the @xmath82-plane .",
    "this means that we can fully characterize such an ellipse by introducing the position - dependent _ meridional stokes parameters _ @xmath101 , defined in terms of the vectors @xmath102 , as @xcite , @xmath103 specifically , for @xmath84 we find @xmath104 from these expression and eqs . , we obtain after a straightforward calculation , @xmath105 at points @xmath10 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the wave is circularly polarized and the spin am density is _ maximal_.",
    "this occurs when @xmath108 , that is when @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , irrespective of the values of @xmath1 . as we will see later",
    ", the form for the stokes parameters is generic for propagation invariant light beams carrying transverse spin am density .",
    "it should be noted that the expression in the last row of eq . reveals , when compared with eq .",
    ", that @xmath111_x$ ] .    in all elementary examples considered above ,",
    "the spin am density and the local wave vector are perpendicular everywhere , irrespective of the position @xmath10 , @xmath112 therefore , we say that the spin am density is transverse in a _",
    "local _ sense , which is a strong condition .",
    "later , when we will study fields more general than @xmath113 , we will find waves with spin am density transverse in a _",
    "global _ sense , namely fulfilling the weaker requirement @xmath114 where we have used the fact that according to our choice of the reference frame , @xmath115 is directed along @xmath116 .",
    "in addition to the few basic properties illustrated in this section , the two plane - wave fields @xmath113 possess many other interesting characteristics , thoroughly investigated in @xcite . however , these are only particular solutions of maxwell s equations exhibiting transverse spin am density .",
    "conversely , we are going now to consider general electromagnetic waves carrying transverse spin am density .",
    "let us begin the study of perfectly general fields exhibiting photonic wheel structures , by noticing that eq . can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 , etc . , and we have defined @xmath119 \\nonumber \\\\   =   & \\ ; \\cos \\left ( { \\bm{\\kappa}}\\cdot { \\bm{\\rho}}\\right )   \\exp(i z k_z ) , \\ ] ] with @xmath120 and @xmath121 denoting the transverse parts of the wave and position vectors , respectively .    instead of the particular two plane - wave field",
    "@xmath122 , let us consider now an arbitrary solution @xmath123 of the monochromatic helmholtz equation , @xmath124 , and use it to build the more general electric vector field @xmath125 the @xmath25 vectors of this field can be calculated from eq . .",
    "the result is @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 denote , respectively , the real and the imaginary part of @xmath129 .",
    "it is not hard to show from eq .",
    "that the spin am density is either automatically transverse and parallel to the @xmath68-axis or null , depending on the shape of the functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 : @xmath132 a lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that the local wave vector @xmath133 possesses nonzero @xmath68- , @xmath67- and @xmath1-components ( we do not report their expressions here because they are cumbersome and not very illuminating ) and , therefore , is not longitudinal .",
    "this means that , as anticipated , @xmath134 is not transverse in a local sense .",
    "however , it can be still transverse in a global sense providing that @xmath135 is parallel to @xmath136 . in order to determine what conditions the generic field @xmath123 must satisfy in order to yield @xmath135 parallel to @xmath136 , we first rewrite it in the standard _ homogeneous angular spectrum _ representation , @xmath137 where @xmath138 , and @xmath139",
    "is the @xmath140d fourier transform of @xmath141 , with @xmath142 for @xmath143 @xcite .",

    "this is the main result of this section .",
    "we make three remarks .",
    "a.   the condition @xmath145 is just the ( weaker ) version of the mirror - symmetry property @xmath148 exhibited by the two plane - wave field .",
    "thus , the same geometric condition induces both local and global transverse spin am density .",
    "b.   from eqs . and",
    "@xmath149 , it follows that @xmath150 where @xmath151 , @xmath152 etc .",
    "if @xmath153 were an analytic ( or , holomorphic ) function of the complex variable @xmath154 , then its real and imaginary parts @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , would satisfy the so - called cauchy - riemann conditions @xcite , @xmath155 substituting these expressions into eqs .",
    "we obtain , after a little of algebra , @xmath156 @xmath157 means that the light is circularly polarized and the transverse spin am density is maximal .",
    "a similar results for ordinary waves with _ longitudinal _ spin am density , was obtained by leckner @xcite . + if @xmath153 is not an analytic function ( as it is usually the case ) , the conditions can still be satisfied _ locally _ , namely at some isolated points @xmath158 etc . in this case eqs .",
    "become the equations determining the transverse c lines of the electric field @xcite , along which the light is circularly polarized in the @xmath82-plane and the spin am density achieves its maximum value . in these points ,",
    "the tangent to the c lines is perpendicular to the @xmath1-axis . in other words ,",
    "transverse c lines lay on the @xmath159-plane by definition .",
    "c.   just as we did for the elementary two plane - wave fields , also in the general case we can consider both @xmath160 and @xmath161 fields and their linear combinations of the form @xmath162 the derivation of the formulas for the mean wave vector and the transverse spin am density is straightforward and , therefore , will not be reported here .",
    "in the previous section we considered both particular and general scalar fields @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively , as the building blocks of electric vector fields carrying transverse spin am density . we have found that the spin density of the electric field generated by @xmath122 is transverse in a local sense , that is perpendicular to the linear momentum density ( or , local wave vector ) @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , the spin density from @xmath123 is transverse in a global sense , namely perpendicular to the mean linear momentum density @xmath115 .",
    "however , the existence of locally transverse spin density is not restricted to elementary plane - wave fields only .",
    "in fact , suitably prepared propagation invariant beams as bessel and mathieu beams , ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , also possess a locally transverse spin density . to show this ,",
    "consider the two monochromatic scalar fields @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are independent solutions of the transverse helmholtz equation @xmath166 , with @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "these fields are dubbed propagation invariant ( or , non - diffracting ) because the `` intensity '' @xmath169 does not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the electric vector field built from eq . with the replacements @xmath170 and @xmath171 , is @xmath172\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\exp(i k_z z -i \\omega t ) . \\ ] ] this field propagates along the @xmath1-axis and has a longitudinal component out of phase with respect to the transverse ones ; therefore , photonic wheel structures are possible .",
    "the spin am density can be calculated from eq . after determining @xmath25 .",
    "the result is @xmath173 the local wave vector is evaluated with the help of eq . and is equal to @xmath174 { \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}\\nonumber \\\\ = & \\ ; k_z { \\left\\lvert{\\mathbf{e}}({\\mathbf{r}})\\right\\rvert}^2 { \\hat{\\mathbf{z } } } , \\ ] ] with @xmath175 .",
    "as anticipated in the previous section , in this case @xmath16 is factorable in the product between a position - dependent scalar function and a constant vector , namely @xmath176 , with @xmath177 .",
    "since the generic functions @xmath178 and @xmath179 depend on the transverse coordinates @xmath180 only , we conclude that the densities @xmath181 and @xmath16 are orthogonal at all points on the @xmath159-plane , irrespective of the propagation distance @xmath1 .",
    "a convenient illustration of the spin and linear momentum densities and is furnished by the fields @xmath182 where @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 , with @xmath186 , denotes a bessel function of the first kind @xcite .",

    "the main difference between the two densities is that @xmath191 has a cartesian symmetry while @xmath194 manifests cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the local wave vector is purely longitudinal and given by eq . .",
    "electric fields polarized in the meridional plane perpendicular to the azimuthal direction , were considered in @xcite in the context of c lines in three dimensions . a paraxial version thereof",
    "was previously studied in @xcite .",
    "in this section we illustrate the theory developed above with the help of two clear cases .",
    "first , we consider a propagating zeroth - order bessel beam with cartesian symmetry . then , we study an evanescent plane wave .",
    "consider the scalar bessel field @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 , with @xmath198 denoting the aperture of the bessel cone @xcite .",

    "am density and local wave vector can be calculated substituting eqs . into eq . and",
    "eq . , respectively . they are directed along the @xmath68- and @xmath1-axis , respectively .",

    "these are illustrated in fig .",

    "this means that for @xmath217 the electric field has ( almost ) transverse circular polarization uniformly over the @xmath82-plane .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a perfectly general theory of light waves carrying an electric field rotating around an axis perpendicular to the propagation direction , thus producing nonzero transverse spin am density . to define longitudinal and transverse components of the spin angular density , we have assumed that a propagation direction can be unambiguously identified either locally or globally . in the first case ,",
    "the direction of light at any point @xmath218 is identified by the local wave vector @xmath219 . in the second case ,",
    "the propagation direction is fixed by the mean wave vector @xmath220 defined as the integral of the local wave vector over the cross - section of the beam .",
    "the novelty of our approach resides in its general character , which provides for a conceptual unifying view of seemingly different polarization wave phenomena .",
    "the success of such unification is made manifest in the several examples reported in this paper .",

    "<S> a circularly polarized electromagnetic plane wave carries an electric field that rotates clockwise or counterclockwise around the propagation direction of the wave . according to the handedness of this rotation , its _ longitudinal _ </S>",
    "<S> spin angular momentum density is either parallel or antiparallel to the propagation of light . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are also light waves that are not simply plane and carry an electric field that rotates around an axis perpendicular to the propagation direction , thus yielding _ transverse _ spin angular momentum density . electric field configurations of this kind have been suggestively dubbed `` photonic wheels '' . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently shown that photonic wheels are commonplace in optics as they occur in electromagnetic fields confined by waveguides , in strongly focused beams , in plasmonic and evanescent waves . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we establish a general theory of electromagnetic waves propagating along a well defined direction , which carry transverse spin angular momentum density . </S>",
    "<S> we show that depending on the shape of these waves , the spin density may be either perpendicular to the _ mean _ linear momentum ( globally transverse spin ) or to the linear momentum _ density _ ( locally transverse spin ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the latter case generically occurs only for non - diffracting beams , such as the bessel beams . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we introduce the concept of _ meridional _ stokes parameters to operationally quantify the transverse spin density . </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate our theory , we apply it to the exemplary cases of bessel beams and evanescent waves . </S>",
    "<S> these results open a new and accessible route to the understanding , generation and manipulation of optical beams with transverse spin angular momentum density . </S>"
