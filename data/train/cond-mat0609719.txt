    "<S> an atomistic approach is used to investigate finite - temperature properties of ferroelectric nanodots that are embedded in a polarizable medium . </S>",
    "<S> different phases are predicted , depending on the ferroelectric strengths of the material constituting the dot and of the system forming the medium . in particular , novel states , exhibiting a coexistence between two kinds of order parameters or possessing a peculiar order between dipole vortices of adjacent dots , are discovered . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the origins of these phases , e.g. depolarizing fields and medium - driven interactions between dots .    </S>",
    "<S> ferroelectric nanostructures ( fens ) are of current high interest , because of their technological promise in leading toward miniaturized devices @xcite , and because of their potential in resulting in new phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , is was recently predicted that _ isolated _ nanodots of ferroelectrics can have a vortex structure for their dipoles below a critical temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such vortex does not create any polarization but rather generates a macroscopic toroidal moment , that involves the cross product between the @xmath0   vectors locating the @xmath1 unit cells and their local electrical dipoles @xmath2  i.e. , it is defined as @xmath3 , where the sum runs over the @xmath4 unit cells of the nanodot . </S>",
    "<S> being able to switch the direction of @xmath5 opens exciting opportunities for nanomemory devices @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the possibility for the dipoles to form a vortex structure has been omitted in the previous studies ( see , e.g. , refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that used an effective medium approximation ) aimed in determining the properties of ferroelectric or paraelectric nanoparticles that are _ embedded _ in a polarizable medium . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , original features may have been overlooked in these composite systems . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , one may wonder if novel states occur in such two - component materials . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , can dipole vortices in dots immersed in a polarizable medium coexist with a spontaneous polarization ( unlike in isolated dots @xcite ) ? similarly , how do toroidal moments of neighboring dots organize themselves ? </S>",
    "<S> ( e.g , are they lying along parallel or antiparallel directions ? ) . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be worthwhile to determine the dependency of these novel states ( if any ) on the ferroelectrics strengths of the materials forming the dot and medium , and to reveal their governing mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to address the issues mentioned above , by performing atomistic simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> our atomistic scheme is based on the construction of an effective hamiltonian , with the total energy @xmath6 being written as a sum of two main terms , @xmath7 where @xmath8  as in refs . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath23 are dimensionless local displacements which are related to the inhomogeneous strain variables inside each cell @xcite . @xmath24 and @xmath25 characterize the strengths of the alloying - induced intersite interactions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 is a unit vector joining the site @xmath21 to the center of the soft - mode vector @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a unit vector joining the site @xmath21 to the origin of the displacement @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> practically , we included contributions up to the third neighbors for @xmath30 , and over the first - neighbor shell for @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , for systems made of ab@xmath12o@xmath13 dots embedded in a ab@xmath11o@xmath13 medium , these contributions only play a role near the dots surfaces  because of the analytical expression of the first two terms of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the last term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , which involves the @xmath32 parameters , characterizes the onsite contribution of alloying . </S>",
    "<S> it is an original contribution since it was not included in the alloy effective hamiltonians of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate such term here  which is consistent with first - principles results of ref . @xcite  because it provides an easy way to artificially adjust the `` ferroelectric strength '' of ab@xmath11o@xmath13 and ab@xmath12o@xmath13 simple systems , by playing with the @xmath33 and @xmath34 parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a large negative ( respectively , positive ) @xmath35 leads to a strong ferroelectric instability ( respectively , no ferroelectric instability ) of the pure ab@xmath12o@xmath13 material . in the following </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) is used in monte - carlo simulations to obtain the local mode vectors , the toroidal moment of polarization and the homogeneous strain tensor @xmath42 at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> typically , 2@xmath4310@xmath44 monte - carlo sweeps are first performed to equilibrate the system , and then 8@xmath4310@xmath44 sweeps are used to get various statistical averages . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is decreased in small steps down to 1k . </S>",
    "<S> we also heat up the investigated systems by small temperature steps from 1k , to look for thermal hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> we also computed the dielectric susceptibility , as well as the toroidal susceptibility ( which characterizes the response of the toroidal moment to the curl of the electric field @xcite ) , as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the temperature - versus-@xmath36 phase diagram of a @xmath45 periodic supercell ( 20480 atoms , 64  lateral size ) containing an ab@xmath12o@xmath13 cubic dot of 48  of lateral dimension embedded in a host matrix made of pure ab@xmath11o@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> practically , for _ positive _ @xmath36 , @xmath34 is set to zero while @xmath33 is allowed to vary . </S>",
    "<S> these cases thus correspond to a specific ferroelectric dot immersed in different media that are all ferroelectrically - harder than the dot and that can either be ferroelectric ( small positive @xmath36 ) or paraelectric ( larger positive @xmath36 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reverse situation applies for the case of _ negative _ @xmath46 : @xmath34 is varied while @xmath33 vanishes , implying that we mimic either ferroelectric dots with smaller ferroelectricity strength than the medium ( for small negative @xmath36 ) or paraelectric dots ( for larger negative @xmath36 ) inserted in a matrix made from a specific ferroelectric material .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 reveals the existence of six different phases , for which the associated dipole patterns are displayed in insets [ phase boundaries were practically determined by identifying the peak or abrupt jumps of the susceptibilites altogether with the appearance of the spontaneous polarization or toroidal moment . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in principle , further study could reveal some of these features to be associated with continuous changes in configuration rather than true phase boundaries _ per se_. </S>",
    "<S> however , some preliminary results obtained by us on the basis of the finite - size scaling analysis @xcite do confirm the existence of true phase transitions . ] </S>",
    "<S> two of these phases are expected based on previous knowledge of ferroelectrics : the paraelectric , pe , state at high temperature , and the ferroelectric , fe1 , phase occurring at intermediate and low temperature when @xmath36 is small in magnitude . in this fe1 state , </S>",
    "<S> both the dot and medium develop homogeneous parallel dipoles  with these dipoles being larger ( resp . , smaller ) in the dot than in the host when @xmath36 is positive ( resp . , negative ) , as consistent with our definition of @xmath36 ( i.e. , the difference between the onsite parameters of the medium and the dot ) .    </S>",
    "<S> four phases of fig .  1 can be considered as novel structures . </S>",
    "<S> they are denoted as ft , fe1+ft , fe2 and fe3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the ft phase , which occurs for the largest positive @xmath36 values , exhibits a finite toroidal moment . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of this state in this region of the phase diagram results from the fighting of the dipoles in the dot against the large enough depolarizing field @xcite ( which arises from the significant non - similarity between the `` more ferroelectric '' dot and  ` less ferroelectric' host material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present discovery of this ft phase is , in fact , consistent with the previous finding that _ isolated _ ferroelectric dots surrounded by vacuum exhibit a vortex structure for their dipoles below a critical temperature @xcite , because one can think of vacuum as a medium having an infinite positive value for @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> however and unlike in the vacuum , the dipoles of the host matrix in the ft phase become slightly polarized by the nearby dipoles located inside the dots and near the surfaces , when this host matrix is still rather `` soft '' ( see corresponding inset of fig.1 ) . for such cases , </S>",
    "<S> the medium thus also generates a toroidal moment that is parallel to , but of lower magnitude than , the one solely associated with the dot .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the fe1+ft phase appearing in the phase diagram at small temperature and within a narrow range of positive @xmath36 is rather remarkable because it displays an unusual cohabitation between the toroidal moment and the spontaneous polarization . in this phase </S>",
    "<S> , the medium generates an electric field inside the dot , that ( as in some magnetic nanodots under an external magnetic field @xcite or in some ferroelectric dots subject to electric fields @xcite ) leads to the shift of the vortex structure with respect to the center of the dot ( see the corresponding inset in fig . 1 ) and thus activates a polarization . note , too , that this fe1+ft phase can be considered as a low - temperature bridging structure between the fe1 and ft phases since we numerically found that the fe1to  fe1+ft and fe1+ft  to  ft transitions are second - order in character , unlike the ft  to - fe1 phase transition that displays all the expected features of a first - order phase transition ( e.g. , the toroidal moment suddenly disappears at this boundary in favor of a _ finite _ value of the polarization , and the ft  to  fe1 boundary line has a rather large thermal hysteresis : it is typically increased by @xmath40 100 k with respect to the one displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 when heating , rather than cooling ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the last two phases , fe2 and fe3 , appearing in fig .  1 are both ferroelectric and occur at intermediate and low temperatures , respectively , for the largest negative values of @xmath48 . in other words , these two states correspond to cases for which the dot , unlike the medium , is made of a material that desires to be paraelectric . as a result , the fe2 phase exhibits a spontaneous polarization that originates from the alignment along a @xmath39 direction of dipoles belonging to some _ specific regions of the medium_. more specifically , these regions belong to the @xmath49 planes that contain the polarization direction and that do not possess any site belonging to the dot ( see , e.g , the corresponding inset of fig . 1 for fe2 showing the homogeneity of dipoles in the top and bottom planes , while the parts of the medium located at the right and left sides of the dot do _ not _ display any homogeneity for their dipoles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason behind such unique arrangement , in which the largest dipoles in the medium intentionally avoid to point towards the dots , is once again the minimization of the depolarizing energy . </S>",
    "<S> when decreasing the temperature , the fe2 phase transforms into the fe3 state , that is associated with a polarization that has now two non - vanishing components along two different @xmath39 directions . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the corresponding inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 reveals that , in the fe3 phase , the top and bottom parts of the medium exhibit dipoles that are similar in direction than those in the fe2 phase , while dipoles located in the medium at the right and left sides of the dot have dipoles aligned along a _ perpendicular _ direction . </S>",
    "<S> such dipole arrangement arises , once again , from a minimization of the depolarizing energy . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the fe2 and fe3 phases bear resemblance to some states that were experimentally found recently in artificially constructed magnets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , note that we numerically found that another solution ( but of slightly higher energy than that of the fe3 phase ) is possible at low temperature for large negative @xmath48 : it consists of the top and bottom parts of the medium having dipoles homogeneously aligned a specific @xmath39 directions ( as in the fe2 phase ) while the dipoles of the medium located at the right and left sides of the dot form a vortex structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we also numerically checked that all the phases of fig .  1 still occur when varying the size of the dot or the size of the whole supercell . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , out of these six states , the ft and fe1+ft phases are the soles structures that refine themselves when allowing _ several _ </S>",
    "<S> ab@xmath12o@xmath13 dots to be present in a supercell possessing a ab@xmath11o@xmath13 medium . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , figs 2 show that , for large enough positive @xmath48 , neighboring dots have vortices rotating in an _ opposite _ fashion . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the ft ( respectively , the fe1+ft ) phase of fig.1 should in fact become the aft ( respectively , fe1+aft ) structure of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ( respectively , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) when dots are close enough from each other ( as in dots arrays ) . </S>",
    "<S> such novel _ antiferrotoric _ phases , unlike the ft and ft+fe1 states , allow the dipoles located _ between _ two adjacent dots to all point along similar directions , which minimizes the corresponding domain wall energy at the cost of the electrostatic interaction between neighboring vortices ( we numerically found that the direct electrostatic interaction between two different toroidal moments should align these moments along the same direction  that is , it should lead to a ferrotoric , rather than antiferrotoric , order ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b reveals that the centers of the vortices in the fe1+aft phase form a rather unusual lattice ( see , e.g. , that the centers of the vortices have different y - locations for dots that are adjacent along the x - axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> this unique geometry originates from the desire of the whole system to maximize the number of its dipoles ( in the dots ) lying along the polarization direction , considering the underlying antiferrotoric order .    in summary , varying the polarizabilities of the embedded dots and of the medium opens a new way for engineering dipole patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental reasons behind such engineering are depolarizing - fields effects and medium - driven interactions between dots . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our findings may result in promising applications using negative refraction materials @xcite , nanomemory devices , etc .... they should also be relevant to , and thus lead to revisiting the analysis of , samples ( i ) made of composites @xcite ; ( ii ) in which segregation takes places ( e.g. , ba(zr , ti)o@xmath13 for intermediate compositions @xcite ) ; ( iii ) in which chemically - ordered nanoregions form inside a disordered matrix ( e.g. , relaxors such as pb(mg , nb)o@xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . one can also easily imagine that further considering multi - component ( e.g. , three - component ) systems can lead to even richer phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , designing some specific _ lattice _ of ferroelectric dots ( inside some medium ) may lead to other exotic states  as similar to the recent finding of ref . </S>",
