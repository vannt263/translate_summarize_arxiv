    "power control is used for resource allocation and interference management in both the uplink and downlink of code division multiple access ( cdma ) systems . in the uplink ,",
    "the purpose of power control is to allow each user to transmit enough power so that it can achieve the required quality of service ( qos ) at the uplink receiver without causing unnecessary interference to other users in the system .",
    "one of the key issues in wireless system design is energy consumption at users terminals . since in many scenarios ,",
    "the users terminals are battery - powered , efficient energy management schemes are required in order to prolong the battery life .",
    "hence , power control plays an even more crucial role in such systems .",
    "recently , game theory has been used to study power control in data networks and has been shown to be a very effective tool for examining this problem ( see for example @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide some motivation for using game theory to study communication systems , and in particular power control . in @xcite and @xcite , power control",
    "is modeled as a non - cooperative game in which users choose their transmit powers in order to maximize their utilities , where utility is defined as the ratio of throughput to transmit power . in @xcite",
    ", pricing is introduced to obtain a more efficient solution .",
    "similar approaches are taken in @xcite for different utility functions . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors extend the approach in@xcite to study the cross - layer problem of joint multiuser detection and power control .",
    "multi - carrier cdma , which combines the benefits of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) with those of cdma , is considered to be a potential candidate for next generation high data - rate wireless systems ( see @xcite ) . in particular , in multi - carrier direct - sequence cdma ( ds - cdma ) , the data stream for each user is divided into multiple parallel streams . each stream is first spread using a spreading sequence and is then transmitted on a carrier @xcite . in a single user scenario with a fixed total transmit power ,",
    "the optimal power allocation strategy for maximizing the rate is waterfilling over the frequency channels @xcite .",
    "the multiuser scenario is more complicated . in @xcite , for example , several waterfilling type approaches have been investigated for multiuser systems to maximize the overall throughput .",
    "however , there are many practical situations where enhancing power efficiency is more important than maximizing throughput . for such applications , it is more important to maximize the number of bits that can be transmitted per joule of energy consumed rather than to maximize the throughput .",
    "consider a multiple - access multi - carrier ds - cdma network where each user wishes to locally and selfishly choose its transmit powers over the carriers in such a way as to maximize its own utility .",
    "however , the strategy chosen by a user affects the performance of other users in the network through multiple - access interference .",
    "there are several questions to ask concerning this interaction .",
    "first of all , what is a reasonable choice of a utility function that measures energy efficiency in a multi - carrier network ? secondly , given such a utility function , what strategy should a user choose in order to maximize its utility ? if every user in the network selfishly and locally picks its utility - maximizing strategy , will there be a stable state at which no user can unilaterally improve its utility ( nash equilibrium ) ?",
    "if such a state exists , will it be unique",
    "? what will be the distribution of users among the carriers at such an equilibrium ?",
    "because of the competitive nature of the users interaction , game theory is the natural framework for modeling and studying such a power control problem .",
    "this work is the first game - theoretic treatment of power control in multi - carrier cdma systems .",
    "we propose a non - cooperative power control game in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power over each carrier to maximize its overall utility .",
    "the utility function here is defined as the ratio of the user s total throughput to its total transmit power over all the carriers .",
    "this utility function , which has units of _ bits / joule _ , measures the total number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed and is particularly suitable for applications where saving power is critical . because of the non - cooperative nature of the proposed game , no coordination among the users",
    "is assumed .",
    "compared to prior work on non - cooperative power control games , there are two difficulties to the problem studied in this paper .",
    "one is that users strategies in the multi - carrier case are vectors ( rather than scalars ) and this leads to an exponentially larger strategy set for each user ( i.e. , many more possibilities ) .",
    "secondly , the energy efficiency utility function , which is considered here , is non - quasiconcave .",
    "this means that many of the standard theorems from game theory as well as convex optimization can not be used here . in this work ,",
    "we derive the nash equilibrium @xcite for the proposed power control game and study its existence and uniqueness .",
    "we also address the following questions .",
    "if there exists a nash equilibrium for this game , can the users reach the equilibrium in a distributive manner ?",
    "what kind of carrier allocations among the competing users will occur at a nash equilibrium ?",
    "will there be an even spread of usage of the carriers among users ?",
    "how does the performance of this joint maximization of utility over all the carriers compare with that of an approach where utility is maximized independently over each carrier ? how does a multi - carrier system compare with a single - carrier system in terms of energy efficiency ?",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ background ] , we provide some background for this work by discussing the power control game for the single - carrier case . the power control game for multi - carrier systems",
    "is presented in section  [ ncpcg ] . the nash equilibrium and its existence for the proposed game",
    "are discussed in sections  [ nash equilibrium ] and [ existence ne ] , respectively . in particular , in section  [ nash equilibrium ] , we derive the utility maximizing strategy for a single user when all the other users transmit powers are fixed . in section [ existence ne ] , we show that depending on the channel gains , the proposed power control game may have no equilibrium , a unique equilibrium , or more than one equilibrium , and we derive conditions that characterize the existence and uniqueness of nash equilibrium for a matched filter receiver .",
    "the case of two - carrier systems is studied in more detail in section  [ special case ] , where we obtain explicit expressions for the probabilities corresponding to occurrence of various possible nash equilibria . in section",
    "[ algorithm ] , we present an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching the nash equilibrium ( when it exists ) .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  [ simulation ] .",
    "we show that at nash equilibrium , with a high probability , the users are evenly distributed among the carriers .",
    "we also demonstrate that our proposed method of jointly maximizing the utility over all the carriers provides a significant improvement in performance compared with a single - carrier system as well the multi - carrier case in which each user simply optimizes over each carrier independently .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "let us first look at the power control game with a single carrier . to pose the power control problem as a non - cooperative game , we first need to define a utility function suitable for data applications .",
    "most data applications are sensitive to error but tolerant to delay .",
    "it is clear that a higher signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) level at the output of the receiver will generally result in a lower bit error rate and hence higher throughput .",
    "however , achieving a high sinr level requires the user terminal to transmit at a high power , which in turn results in low battery life .",
    "this tradeoff can be quantified ( as in @xcite ) by defining the utility function of a user to be the ratio of its throughput to its transmit power , i.e. , @xmath0 throughput is the net number of information bits that are transmitted without error per unit time ( sometimes referred to as _ goodput _ ) .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the number of information bits and the total number of bits in a packet , respectively ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the transmission rate and the sinr for the @xmath6 user , respectively ; and @xmath7 is the efficiency function representing the packet success rate ( psr ) , i.e. , the probability that a packet is received without an error .",
    "our assumption is that if a packet has one or more bit errors , it will be retransmitted .",
    "the efficiency function , @xmath8 , is assumed to be increasing , continuous , and s - shaped ( sigmoidal ) with @xmath9 .",
    "we also require that @xmath10 to ensure that @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "these assumptions are valid in many practical systems .",
    "an example of a sigmoidal efficiency function is given in fig .",
    "[ fig - eff - func ] . using a sigmoidal efficiency function , the shape of the utility function in is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - util - func ] as a function of the user s transmit power keeping other users transmit powers fixed .",
    "it should be noted that the throughput @xmath13 in ( [ eq1 ] ) could be replaced with any increasing concave function as long as we make sure that @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the efficiency function can be found in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for a sigmoidal efficiency function , the utility function in ( [ eq1a ] ) is a quasiconcave defined on a convex set @xmath14 is quasiconcave if every superlevel set of @xmath15 is convex , i.e. , @xmath16 is convex for every value of @xmath17 . ]",
    "function of the user s transmit power @xcite .",
    "this is also true if the throughput in ( [ eq1 ] ) is replaced with an increasing concave function of @xmath5 .",
    "based on ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) , the utility function for user @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 this utility function , which has units of _ bits / joule _ , captures very well the tradeoff between throughput and battery life and is particularly suitable for applications where saving power is crucial .",
    "power control is modeled as a non - cooperative game in which each user tries to selfishly maximize its own utility .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , in a single - carrier system , when matched filters are used as the uplink receivers , if user terminals are allowed to choose only their transmit powers for maximizing their utilities , then there exists an equilibrium point at which no user can improve its utility given the power levels of other users ( nash equilibrium ) .",
    "this equilibrium is achieved when the users transmit powers are sinr - balanced with the output sinr being equal to @xmath20 , the solution to @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , this equilibrium is unique . in @xcite ,",
    "this analysis is extended to other linear receivers .    in this work",
    ", we extend this game - theoretic approach to multi - carrier systems . in the multi - carrier case ,",
    "each user s strategy is a vector ( rather than a scalar ) .",
    "furthermore , the utility function is not a quasiconcave function of the user s strategy .",
    "hence , the problem is much more challenging than the one in the single - carrier scenario .",
    "let us consider the uplink of a synchronous multi - carrier ds - cdma data network with @xmath22 users , @xmath23 carriers and processing gain @xmath24 ( for each carrier ) .",
    "the carriers are assumed to be sufficiently far apart so that the ( spread - spectrum ) signal transmitted over each carrier does not interfere with the signals transmitted over other carriers @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the delay spread and doppler spread are negligible for each individual carrier . at the transmitter ,",
    "the incoming bits for user @xmath18 are divided into @xmath23 parallel streams and each stream is spread using the spreading code of user @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath23 parallel streams are then sent over the @xmath23 ( orthogonal ) carriers .",
    "for the @xmath25 carrier , the received signal at the uplink receiver ( after chip - matched filtering and sampling ) can be represented by an @xmath26 vector as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the @xmath6 user s transmitted bit , transmit power and path gain , respectively , for the @xmath25 frequency channel ( carrier ) ; @xmath31 is the spreading sequence for user @xmath18 which is assumed to be random with unit norm ; and @xmath32 is the noise vector which is assumed to be gaussian with mean @xmath33 and covariance @xmath34 .",
    "let us express the channel gain as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distance of user @xmath18 from the uplink receiver and @xmath37 is a rayleigh random variable representing the small scale channel fading . here ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are constants which determine the path loss as a function of distance .",
    "we propose a non - cooperative game in which each user chooses its transmit powers over the @xmath23 carriers to maximize its overall utility .",
    "in other words , each user ( selfishly ) decides how much power to transmit over each frequency channel ( carrier ) to achieve the highest overall utility .",
    "let @xmath40 $ ] denote the proposed non - cooperative game where @xmath41 , and @xmath42^d$ ] is the strategy set for the @xmath6 user . here",
    ", @xmath43 is the maximum transmit power on each carrier .",
    "each strategy in @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the utility function for user @xmath18 is defined as the ratio of the total throughput to the total transmit power for the @xmath23 carriers , i.e. , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the throughput achieved by user @xmath18 over the @xmath25 carrier , and is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 denoting the received sinr for user @xmath18 on carrier @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the resulting non - cooperative game can be expressed as the following maximization problem : @xmath51 under the constraint of non - negative powers ( i.e. , @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) . without significant loss of generality ,",
    "if we assume equal transmission rates for all users , ( [ eq7 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath55 the relationship between the @xmath49 s and the @xmath29 s is dependent on the uplink receiver .",
    "it should be noted that the assumption of equal transmission rates for all users can be made less restrictive . for our analysis , it is sufficient for the users to have equal transmission rates over different carriers but the transmission rate can be different for different users . more generally , the proposed power control game can be extended to allow the users to pick not only their transmit powers but also their transmission rates over the @xmath23 carriers . while joint power and rate control is important , particularly for data applications , our focus throughout this work is on power control only .",
    "we will briefly comment on the joint power and rate control problem at the end of section  [ nash equilibrium ] .",
    "for the non - cooperative power control game proposed in the previous section , a nash equilibrium is a set of power vectors , @xmath56 , such that no user can unilaterally improve its utility by choosing a different power vector , i.e. , @xmath57 is a nash equilibrium if and only if @xmath58 and for @xmath53 . here , @xmath59 denotes the set of transmit power vectors of all the users except for user @xmath18 .",
    "we begin by characterizing utility maximization by a single user when other users transmit powers are fixed .",
    "* proposition 1 * : for all linear receivers and with all other users transmit powers being fixed , user @xmath18 s utility function , given by ( [ eq6 ] ) , is maximized when @xmath60 where @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the transmit power required by user @xmath18 to achieve an output sinr equal to @xmath20 on the @xmath25 carrier , or @xmath43 if @xmath20 can not be achieved . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the unique ( positive ) solution of @xmath63 .",
    "_ proof _ : we first show that @xmath64 is maximized when @xmath65 is such that @xmath66 . for this , we take the derivative of @xmath64 with respect to @xmath65 and equate it to zero to obtain @xmath67 since for all linear receivers @xmath68 @xcite , @xmath64 is maximized when @xmath66 , the ( positive ) solution to @xmath69 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for an s - shaped function , @xmath20 exists and is unique .",
    "if @xmath20 can not be achieved , @xmath64 is maximized when @xmath70 .",
    "now , define @xmath62 as the transmit power required by user @xmath18 to achieve an output sinr equal to @xmath20 on the @xmath25 carrier ( or @xmath43 if @xmath20 is not achievable ) and let @xmath61 . in case of ties",
    ", we can pick any of the indices corresponding to the minimum power .",
    "then , based on the above argument we have @xmath71 for any @xmath72 . also , because @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 for all @xmath75 and @xmath76 . based on the above inequalities , we can write @xmath77 adding the @xmath23 inequalities given in ( [ eq12 ] ) and rewriting the resulting inequality , we have @xmath78 this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath79    proposition 1 suggests that the utility for user @xmath18 is maximized when the user transmits only over its ",
    "best \" carrier such that the achieved sinr at the output of the uplink receiver is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "best \" carrier is the one that requires the least amount of transmit power to achieve @xmath20 at the output of the uplink receiver . based on proposition 1 , at a nash equilibrium",
    "each user transmits only on one carrier .",
    "this significantly reduces the number of cases that need to be considered as possible candidates for a nash equilibrium .",
    "a set of power vectors , @xmath80 , is a nash equilibrium if and only if they simultaneously satisfy ( [ eq11a ] ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the utility - maximizing strategy suggested by proposition 1 is different from the waterfilling approach that is discussed in @xcite for digital subscriber line ( dsl ) .",
    "this is because in @xcite , utility is defined as the user s throughput and the goal there is to maximize this utility function for a fixed amount of available power . here ,",
    "on the other hand , the amount of available power is not fixed .",
    "in addition , utility is defined here as the number of bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed which is particularly suitable for systems with energy constraints .    alternatively ,",
    "user @xmath18 s utility function can be defined as @xmath81 .",
    "this utility function is maximized when each of the terms in the summation is maximized .",
    "this happens when the user transmits on all the carriers at power levels that achieve @xmath20 for every carrier .",
    "this is equivalent to the case in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier independently .",
    "we show in section [ simulation ] that our proposed joint maximization approach , through performing a distributed interference avoidance mechanism , significantly outperforms the approach of individual utility maximization . throughout this paper ,",
    "the expression in is used for the user s utility function .    since at nash equilibrium ( when it exists ) , each user must transmit on one carrier only , there are exactly @xmath82 possibilities for an equilibrium . for example , in the case of @xmath83 , there are four possibilities for nash equilibrium :    * user 1 and user  2 both transmit on the first carrier .",
    "* user 1 and user  2 both transmit on the second carrier .",
    "* user 1 transmits on the first carrier and user  2 transmits on the second carrier . *",
    "user 1 transmits on the second carrier and user  2 transmits on the first carrier .    depending on the set of channel gains , i.e. , the @xmath30 s",
    ", the proposed power control game may have no equilibrium , a unique equilibrium , or more than one equilibrium . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the existence and uniqueness of nash equilibrium for the conventional matched filter receiver and also comment on the extensions of the results to other linear multiuser receivers such as the decorrelating and minimum mean square error ( mmse ) detectors @xcite @xcite .    for the joint power and rate control problem ,",
    "it can be shown by using a similar technique as the one used in the proof of proposition 1 that for each user to maximize its own utility , the user must transmit only on its  best \" carrier .",
    "furthermore , the combined choice of power and rate has to be such that the output sinr is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that there are infinite combinations of power and rate that maximize the user s utility given that the powers and rates of other users are fixed .",
    "if we assume random spreading sequences , the output sinr for the @xmath25 carrier of the @xmath6 user with a matched filter receiver is given by @xmath84 let us define @xmath85 as the  effective channel gain \" for user @xmath18 over the @xmath25 carrier .",
    "based on ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) , we have @xmath86 .",
    "let us for now assume that the processing gain is sufficiently large so that even when all @xmath22 users transmit on the same carrier , @xmath20 can be achieved by all users .",
    "this is the case when @xmath87 .",
    "we later relax this assumption .",
    "the following proposition helps identify the nash equilibrium ( when it exists ) for a given set of channel gains .",
    "* proposition 2 * : for a matched filter receiver , a necessary condition for user @xmath18 to transmit on the @xmath25 carrier at equilibrium is that @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number of users transmitting on the @xmath90 carrier and @xmath91 in this case , @xmath92 .",
    "_ proof _ : based on proposition 1 , in order for user @xmath18 to transmit on carrier @xmath50 at equilibrium , we must have @xmath93 since @xmath94 users ( including user @xmath18 ) are transmitting on the @xmath25 carrier and @xmath89 users are transmitting on the @xmath90 carrier and all users have an output sinr equal to @xmath20 , we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the received powers for each user on the @xmath25 and @xmath90 carriers , respectively .",
    "now define @xmath99 to get @xmath100 and @xmath101 . substituting @xmath102 and @xmath103 into ( [ eq15b ] ) and ( [ eq15c ] ) and taking advantage of the fact that @xmath104 , we get @xmath105 and @xmath106 consequently , ( [ eq14 ] ) is obtained by substituting ( [ eq15d ] ) and ( [ eq15e ] ) into ( [ eq15a ] ) . furthermore , since @xmath107",

    "furthermore , satisfying a set of @xmath113 of such inequalities by the @xmath22 users is sufficient for existence of nash equilibrium but the uniqueness is not guaranteed .",
    "for example , for the case of @xmath83 , the four possible equilibria can be characterized as follows .",
    "* for both users to transmit on the first carrier at equilibrium , we must have @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "shows the regions corresponding to the above four equilibria .",
    "it can be seen that for certain values of channel gains there is no nash equilibrium ( the white areas in the figure ) and for some values of channel gains there are two possible equilibria .",
    "when the channel gains belong to the white regions , none of the four possible candidates for nash equilibrium is stable .",
    "it can be shown that if we put the two users in any of these four possible states , at least one of the users would prefer to jump to the other carrier because that would improve its utility .",
    "hence , no nash equilibrium exists .",
    "it is interesting to observe that homogeneity of channel gains can prevent nash equilibrium from existing .",
    "consider the two - user two - carrier case where @xmath122 , it is easy to verify the following : + * corollary 1 * : if either @xmath123 or @xmath124 belongs to @xmath125 $ ] , then there does not exist a nash equilibrium .        when the processing gain is less than or equal to @xmath126 , it is not possible for all users to transmit on the same carrier and achieve @xmath20 simultaneously .",
    "instead , they would end up transmitting at the maximum power ( see proposition  1 ) .",
    "more specifically , for any given @xmath127 , at most @xmath128 users can simultaneously achieve @xmath20 on the same carrier .",
    "therefore , as @xmath24 decreases , those nash equilibria in which the distribution of users among the carriers is less uniform are less likely to occur .",
    "this means that for small values of processing gain , the distribution of users among the carriers becomes more uniform .",
    "however , the probability that no nash equilibrium exists increases . we will discuss this further in section  [ special case ] .",
    "similar analysis can be done for the decorrelating and mmse detectors . however , because of the dependence of the sinr expressions of these receivers on the spreading sequences of all the users , obtaining closed form expressions such as the ones given in and is not possible .",
    "to gain some insight into the properties of the nash equilibria for our proposed game , let us concentrate on a system with two carriers and two users ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) .",
    "we assume that the @xmath130 s in are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) among the users and carriers and have the rayleigh distribution with mean 1 . as a result",

    "<S> a game - theoretic model for studying power control in multi - carrier cdma systems is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> power control is modeled as a non - cooperative game in which each user decides how much power to transmit over each carrier to maximize its own utility . </S>",
    "<S> the utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted over all the carriers per joule of energy consumed and is particularly suitable for networks where energy efficiency is important . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - dimensional nature of users strategies and the non - quasiconcavity of the utility function make the multi - carrier problem much more challenging than the single - carrier or throughput - based - utility case . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , for all linear receivers including the matched filter , the decorrelator , and the minimum - mean - square - error ( mmse ) detector , a user s utility is maximized when the user transmits only on its  best \" carrier . </S>",
    "<S> this is the carrier that requires the least amount of power to achieve a particular target signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the output of the receiver . </S>",
    "<S> the existence and uniqueness of nash equilibrium for the proposed power control game are studied . in particular , conditions are given that must be satisfied by the channel gains for a nash equilibrium to exist , and the distribution of the users among the carriers at equilibrium is also characterized . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching the equilibrium ( when it exists ) is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the proposed approach results in significant improvements in the total utility achieved at equilibrium compared to a single - carrier system and also to a multi - carrier system in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier independently .    </S>",
