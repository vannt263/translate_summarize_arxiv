    "microscopic black holes are of great interest in astrophysics and cosmology@xcite . a 4d black hole with a hawking temperature  @xcite @xmath0 should emit all available particle species which appear non - composite compared with the wavelength of the radiated energy .",
    "once @xmath1 mev , quarks and gluons should be directly emitted@xcite and then decay into stable species .",
    "it has been claimed that interactions between emitted particles significantly modify the astrophysically observable spectra from such black holes .",
    "most scenarios are based on the heckler@xcite model in which two - body bremsstrahlung and pair - production interactions form a qed photosphere at @xmath2 gev and a qcd chromosphere at @xmath3 . here",
    "we summarize our recent detailed analysis@xcite of interaction models and discuss various points which prevent the development of photospheres and chromospheres .",
    "the heckler model takes the two - body bremsstrahlung ( and corresponding pair - production ) cross - section@xcite to be @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy of the initial electrons ( @xmath6 ) in the center - of - momentum ( cm ) frame and @xmath7 is the electron mass .",
    "in the cm frame , the average momentum exchanged is @xmath8 ( implying particles must be within @xmath9 of each other to interact ) , the average angle between the final ( ` on - shell ' ) electron and outgoing photon is @xmath10 , and the average energies of the final electron and photon is @xmath11 .",
    "even if a photosphere develops , most particles continue to move radially away from the black hole .",
    "since the average energy@xcite of the hawking emitted electrons is @xmath12 and @xmath13 , a particle emitted by a @xmath14 gev black hole would have to undergo @xmath15 scatterings to deviate @xmath16 radians from the radial direction .",
    "the form of @xmath17 is accurate but , as discussed below , its application must be modified in the black hole context .",
    "the following corrections to the heckler model must be applied :    \\(i ) the black hole rest frame can be shown@xcite to be the cm frame for most pairs of emitted particles but two particles moving in a similar direction , whose cm frame is highly lorentz - boosted relative to the black hole , will not interact near the black hole . thus each particle",
    "is surrounded by an ` exclusion cone ' of particles with which it can not interact significantly . once the particle is a distance @xmath18 from the black hole ,",
    "the transverse distance to the nearest one with which it can interact is @xmath19 .",
    "however , from above we require @xmath20 .",
    "thus particles must be within @xmath9 of the black hole to interact .",
    "this point was omitted in the heckler model .",
    "\\(ii ) because the black hole flux radiates outward from a central point , the mean free path formula @xmath21 employed in the heckler model is not appropriate and must be replaced by a radial description .",
    "additionally , particles created at the black hole do not originate at an infinite distance from their interaction region , contrary to assumptions in the @xmath17 derivation .",
    "thus the effective interaction cross - section for particles emitted by the black hole must be less than @xmath17 .",
    "\\(iii ) any two particles must be in causal contact to interact . for two particles within @xmath9 of the black hole",
    ", it can be shown@xcite that this requires the time between their hawking emission , @xmath22 , to be less than the causal interval @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "however , for the hawking flux @xmath25 .",
    "thus a negligible fraction of emitted particles are causally connected within @xmath9 of the black hole .",
    "this point was omitted in the heckler model .",
    "\\(iv ) the heckler model assumes that the distance required for the formation of a final on - shell electron and its bremsstrahlung photon is @xmath26 in the cm frame . applying the heisenberg uncertainty principle to outgoing particles separated by @xmath13 , the correct distance is @xmath27 in the cm frame .",
    "thus any multiple interactions experienced by an electron within @xmath9 of the black hole are off - shell interactions and so are strongly suppressed by the lpm effect@xcite .",
    "this was omitted in the heckler model .",
    "we conclude that the causal contact requirement and the suppresion of multiple scatterings prevent the development of a heckler qed photosphere .",
    "analoguous arguments also prevent a qcd photosphere developing when @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 ( or more strictly , @xmath30 ) , the hawking flux is damped by the grey - body factors which apply near rest mass thresholds@xcite .",
    "this increases @xmath22 and strengthens the causality constraint .",
    "additionally , the limited available energy per emitted particle ( @xmath31 ) and particle physics conservation laws severely constrain the number of final particles that can be produced per emitted particle .",
    "in particular , gluon bremsstrahlung is insignificant when @xmath29 because the lowest colourless state is a pion and @xmath32 mev .",
    "therefore , the black hole situation is not analogous to the @xmath33 gev per nucleon , gluon - saturated , high baryon / antibaryon asymmetry quark - gluon plasma seen at rhic .",
    "instead , it resembles the conditions in @xmath34 accelerator events , for which the smooth transition around @xmath35 from the direct pion regime to the quark / gluon - mediated regime sets in when the pions ( and hence the constituent quarks ) are relativistic .",
    "this implies that when the black hole goes from directly emitting pions to directly emitting quarks and gluons , the latter are relativistic and do not linger near the black hole .",
    "hence a qcd photosphere should not develop when @xmath29 .",
    "further photosphere and chromosphere scenarios@xcite , including those not based on the heckler model , are analyzed in refs .   and .",
    "in all cases , we find that the observational signatures and detection probabilities of an individual black hole or a cosmic or galactic halo background of primordial black holes remain essentially those@xcite of the standard hawking model , although as first noted in ref .",
    "inner bremsstrahlung photons generated by charged particles as they accelerate away from an individual black hole dominate over the direct hawking photons at low photon frequencies .",
    "we can not exclude , however , the possible enhancement of black hole bursts by unusual ambient fields or new physics . whether a chromosphere can develop around a higher - dimensional black hole is also presently an open question",
