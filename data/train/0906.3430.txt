    "many physical laws are established in the frame of the hypothesis that each single event of a component of an observed system is independent on any other event .",

    "+ many physical phenomena are studied by assuming that all typical events are independent and non correlated as , for instance , the nuclear reaction events that occur to form nuclear fusion rates in stellar cores .",

    ", one assumes that all effects from particle correlations and/or non linear effects can be neglected , being their contribution small .",
    "+ also debye - hckel ( dh ) approach to electron screening , developed to take into account the electron and ion influence over the pure coulomb potential of a given ion charge , is based over additive , linear effects and standard exponential distributions @xcite .",
    "+ very recently , in many different experiments , influence and effects of environment have been observed in addition to the known effects over fusion thermonuclear reactions in stellar cores .",
    "one can assume that these effects are due to correlations , microfield distributions , electron screening , random forces , fluctuations of extensive quantities , among others causes .",
    "here we give a list of the recent observations :    1 .",
    "measurements of electron capture decay rates and constants of @xmath7be in host materials @xcite , of @xmath8-radioactive uranium exposed to glow - discharge plasma @xcite and of other heavy nuclei implanted in different environments @xcite have recently shown fluctuations and variations of previous standard results .",
    "rates of deuteron - deuteron fusion in metal matrices have shown a great increase respect to the standard laboratory measurements and have shown a non negligible influence of the conducting electrons @xcite .",
    "variations observed in electron capture by @xmath9k could be responsible of observed discrepancies in the density ratio u / pb in oklo site phenomenon @xcite .",
    "unexpected and unexplained fluctuations in the decay rates of @xmath10si and @xmath11ra have been reported and evidence of correlations between nuclear decay rates and earth - sun distance has been found ( jenkins - fishbach effect @xcite ) .. 5 .",
    "several careful experiments designed to study the decays of long lived radioactive isotopes have reported observations of small periodic annual variations modulating the well - known exponential decay curve .",
    "if jenkins - fishbach effect is correct we could have to consider profound consequences for many areas of physics and engineering .",
    "discrepancies in half - life determinations of many nuclides reported in literature have been attributed to variations of solar activity during experimental works or to seasonal variations in fundamental constant . however , while in a satellite experiment the correlation between variation of rate and earth - sun distance has not been observed @xcite , other authors suggest that neutrinos from the flare of 13 december 2006 have induced a change in the decay rate of @xmath12mn .",
    "precise half - life of unstable isotopes , in particular of @xmath13c , are considered in doubt , since the jenkins - fishbach effect implies that the decay rate of an isotope is not a constant of nature , in contrast with the findings of rutherford , chadwick and ellis in 1930 that the rate of transformation of an element is constant under all conditions .",
    "a reasonable interpretation of the so called wiggles in @xmath13c decay rate has been suggested by sanders : wiggles indicate that the solar fusion furnace is pulsating in some way like the cepheyd furnace @xcite .",
    "recent work by sturrock on power spectral analyses of radiochemical solar neutrino data and solar irradiance have revealed modulations attributable to non spherically - symmetric and variable nuclear burning in the solar core @xcite .",
    "new determinations of solar cno content based on 3d hydrodynamic model and a new treatment of departure from local thermodynamical equilibrium ( non - lte ) have mined agreement between helioseismology and observations @xcite .",
    "local non - gaussianity of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background and other non - gaussianities revealed by satellite experiments have been discussed recently in many papers to which we send for details , since these problems are not object of our interest here .",
    "of course all the above effects are not concerning with the normal evolution of a star , rather represent fluctuations around average values , the time averages giving rise to constant values",
    ". the states at which the nuclear processes take place are not standard global thermodynamic equilibrium states .",
    "they can be seen as metastable states with a given life time ( eventually a long - lifetime ) and therefore the use of @xmath0-thermostatistics @xcite and/or superstatistics @xcite can be the appropriate approach to be applied to understand the above effects @xcite .",
    "+ in most of all these processes , the first and most important environment effect that operates is the electron screening .",
    "usually it is described by dh potential : coulomb potential which originates from a charge in an astrophysical plasma is screened by the other charges .",
    "decrease of potential is faster than pure coulomb one because of the exponential factor in dh approximation .",
    "+ to have a more complete description one must go beyond dh potential approach ; the electron cloud that screens can be , for instance , more concentrated around the ion that originates the coulomb potential and its momentum distribution can differ from the maxwellian one @xcite .",
    "+ nuclear fusions in stellar cores are influenced by electron screening . among many nuclear astrophysical processes that are influenced by the surroundings ,",
    "the electron capture by nuclei , like for instance e@xmath14be@xmath15li@xmath16 in the sun or e@xmath17p@xmath18n@xmath16 in high density stars , plays a special role because the electron component of the plasma is responsible of the screening and the same electrons are themselves responsible of the screened physical process that is the electron capture by nuclei from bound and continuum states caused by weak nuclear interaction .",
    "the first action is due and characterised by the charge distribution in the coordinate space , with this distribution we can build the screening potential .",
    "the second action is the weak nuclear process of capture with emission of a neutrino .",
    "its rate is characterised by the momentum distribution of electrons in the momentum space .",
    "+ why we are looking for a screening potential different from the widely used dh one ? + if it is required that the distribution in coordinate space be more concentrated around the ion than in dh case , then this can be realized by a @xmath0-distribution with @xmath1 ( depleted tail ) . for instance , we can show in the case of electron capture by @xmath19be , that the electron distribution tail should be depleted and this fact agrees with the requirement that to obtain an increase of the ec rate ( to obtain a decrease of the @xmath19b neutrino flux ) .",
    "+ the number of particles inside the dh sphere is , for many astrophysical systems like stellar core , very low .",
    "therefore standard mb statistics does not apply .",
    "the fluctuation of density is large and due to the connection of density with temperature through the equation of state also the fluctuation of temperature is present .",
    "we may use superstatistics to justify our choice of non extensive statistics and its distribution .",
    "+ coulomb cutoff in the spatial space was already used .",
    "this is the simplest way to screen the coulomb field : to cut it at a certain @xmath20 so that the potential is zero outside @xmath21 .",
    "no other justifications have been advanced for this approach . +",
    "a result analogous to this can be obtained considering density and temperature fluctuation in superstatistics or non linear poisson equation , in such a way that use of the non extensive tsallis statistics with @xmath1 is justified .",
    "of course @xmath1 means that the electron spatial distribution is more concentrated near the positive ion than the distribution responsible of dh screening which is the coulomb potential times an exponential factor .",
    "+ moreover , we have two coordinate spaces to consider : spatial coordinate and momentum coordinate .",
    "if @xmath0 is a universal parameter for the observed system the same @xmath0 should be used for the spatial and for the momentum ( energy ) coordinates system .",
    "we assume that the mechanism that motivates a @xmath1 distribution , due to the density fluctuation , is also responsible , through the relation density - temperature - momentum ( energy ) of the momentum @xmath1 distribution .",
    "therefore also the momentum component of the distribution is a non extensive tsallis distribution with @xmath1 . on the other hand , if the same @xmath0 occurs for spatial coordinate and for momentum coordinate distributions , this could imply some problems with uncertainty principle with @xmath1 systems @xcite .",
    "+ other requirements and observations impose to use a @xmath1 distribution in the momentum space . + for instance , in the study of the spectral lines of the sun",
    "a cutoff is required . as shown , for example in @xcite the electron component of a central core stellar plasma",
    "is made by correlated electrons where fluctuations of several types occur .",
    "the equation of state contains many non standard terms and we can realize that in such a case statistical distribution must deviate from mb one .",
    "+ although very recent experiments at gsi concern with oscillation of decay constants ( known as gsi anomaly ) we do not discuss here this case between the environment effect could be absent due to the specific experimental conditions @xcite .    in this work",
    "we want to limit ourselves to discuss only two nuclear problems of astrophysical interest where we use the modified debye - hckel ( mdh ) approach . before this discussion",
    "we describe how one can go beyond the dh approach and derive a screening potential in an astrophysical plasma using a non extensive @xmath1 electron distribution ( section 2 ) . as an application of the mdh potential we study the d ",
    "d fusion rate in metal matrices . also in this case we take @xmath1 and show that a good agreement with the experimental results can be obtained ( section 3 ) . the electron capture decay by @xmath7be",

    "in fact , it is easy to show that for @xmath1 @xmath68 so that the screening charge is distributed from @xmath69 to @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "therefore if we have information from experiments or from models on the charge distribution we can fix the function @xmath32 and its value . for instance , in @xcite the distribution around deuterons is evaluated by means of a thomas - fermi model .",
    "in recent years a number of different experiments , with target adsorbed in a metallic matrix , have evidenced a strong enhancement in the fusion reaction rate at few @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "for instance , the d(d , t)p reaction has been widely investigated and @xmath72li(d , @xmath73he has been studied with similar results . +",
    "a less strong enhancement has been observed in gas target experiments , that can be easily explained by the standard electron screening , with a potential @xmath74 of the same order of the adiabatic limit @xmath75 .",
    "+ however in deuterated metal target experiments , a potential @xmath74 of hundreds of @xmath76 , ten times greater than the limit @xmath77 , is needed to reproduce the results .",
    "+ a possible explanation has been proposed ( see @xcite ) based on a simplified model of the classical quasi - free electron .",

    "this approach reproduces both the correct size of the screening potential @xmath78 and its dependence on the temperature : @xmath79 , but the mean number of quasi - free particles in the debye sphere results much smaller than one .",
    "then , the picture of the debye screening , which should be a cooperative effect with many participating particles , seems not to be applicable .",
    "+ the thermal motion of the target atoms is another mechanism capable of increasing the reaction rate ; however , maxwellian momentum distribution at the experimental temperatures gives negligible effects .",
    "the relationship between energy and momentum of quasi particles can be broaden by many - body collisions , then a long tail , non - maxwellian momentum distribution can emerge from a mb energy distribution .",
    "fusion processes select high - momentum particles that are able to penetrate the coulomb barrier and are , therefore , extremely sensitive probes of the distribution tail @xcite .",
    "this quantum dispersion effect has been already introduced as a possible explanation of the reaction rate enhancement .",
    "the screening plasma particle effect on the reaction rate has been evaluated adopting for the first time , the mdh potential proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ for instance we compare the mdh astrophysical factor for d - d reaction with the experimental data reported in @xcite , adopting the choice @xmath80 .",

    "an electrostatic screening potential of this order of magnitude has been obtained , for instance , by saltzmann and hass @xcite through a thomas - fermi model of the electron gas in a deuterated - copper target ( they obtained a screening potential of @xmath88 , instead of the @xmath89 needed to reproduce the experimental results ) .",
    "+ now we are treating @xmath32 and @xmath0 as free parameters , but , in principle , a link can be establish between the inverse dh radius , the temperature fluctuations and the @xmath0-index : @xmath90 by this way the modified dh potential can be obtained starting from the environment condition .",
    "+ we conclude : the reaction cross section enhancement , due to plasma screening effects , has been evaluated adopting the mdh potential . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "accounting the matrix metal valence electrons , a screening potential @xmath91 can be obtained , greater than the adiabatic limit @xmath77 but even too low to reproduce the experimental results .",

    "therefore , @xmath94-decays can not participate to a true equilibrium ; they are sufficiently slow so that an equilibrium can be established in a time short compared to the time required for a significant change of the element average composition",
    ". however , environments must be such to satisfy this time condition and this can be so if only frequent and pure coulomb interactions are active .",
    "+ the principle of detailed balance ensures that in global thermodynamic equilibrium loss of electrons captured by nuclei in the medium - high energy tail is counterbalanced by production of such electrons due to inverse reaction .",

    "<S> experimental measurements in terrestrial laboratory , space and astrophysical observations of variation and fluctuation of nuclear decay constants , measurements of large enhancements in fusion reaction rate of deuterons implanted in metals and electron capture by nuclei in solar core indicate that these processes depend on the environment where take place and possibly also on the fluctuation of some extensive parameters and eventually on stellar energy production . electron screening is the first important environment effect . </S>",
