    "if sneutrinos of the mssm are lighter than the lightest chargino and next - to - lightest neutralino , their decays to charged particles are of higher order and strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore sneutrinos decay completely invisibly into a neutrino and the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp , the lightest neutralino in the considered case ) . as a result",
    ", they can not be directly detected in cascade decays at the lhc and a threshold scan at the ilc is precluded for the very same reason .",
    "in such a case , the only possibility to discover sneutrinos is to select a well - reconstructible process where the sneutrino is exchanged or shows up as part of a cascade decay , and in which the precise determination of kinematic distributions gives an access to the sneutrino mass .",
    "this idea has already been exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the lepton - sneutrino decay channel of charginos produced at the ilc has been investigated .",
    "it was argued that background effects are sufficiently under control , so a precise mass determination is possible .",
    "here we report on results of our study for determining sneutrino properties in the sps1a scenario assuming a realistic ilc environment which includes beamstrahlung , initial - state radiation , a complete account of reducible backgrounds from sm and susy processes , and a complete matrix - element calculation of the susy signal encompassing all irreducible background and interference contributions  @xcite using the event generator ` whizard `  @xcite .",
    "the sneutrino mass can be determined by investigating the chargino decay modes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , in chargino pair production process at the ilc . in the following",
    "we assume that the first and second generation sneutrinos , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are mass degenerate .",
    "large backgrounds from same - flavor lepton and slepton production can be avoided by selecting events with leptons of different flavor , i.e.  one of the charginos decaying to an electron , the other to a muon .",
    "therefore , we search for ( semi-)exclusive final states :    [ eq : mainproc ] e^+e^- ^+_1 ^-_1 _ e^*e^-_^+ e^-^+ |_e _ ^0_1 ^ 0_1 .",
    "in the sps1a scenario @xmath4  gev , @xmath5  gev and the born cross section for chargino pair production is predicted to be 173.6 fb at a cm energy of 500 gev . with a br(@xmath6)=13%",
    ", a sufficient sample of events can be expected in this channel .",
    "the two - body chargino decay leads to a uniform decay lepton energy spectrum with edges determined by the chargino and sneutrino masses , which provides a method for their experimental determination  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the signature for the signal process , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mainproc ] ) , is one electron , one anti - muon and missing energy , as a final signature or use both channels . ]",
    "@xmath7    the same final state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mainproc ] ) , can originate from other production processes as well as from interference terms , e.g.  multi - peripheral diagrams , chargino decays into neutralino and @xmath8 , smuon @xmath9 and selectron @xmath10 pair production , and single - resonant sm di - boson production etc .",
    "they will be called collectively as an ` irreducible background ' , in contrast to the ` reducible ' susy background that includes more neutrinos in the final state .",
    "the latter contribution come from processes that lead to one or two leptonically decaying @xmath11 s .",
    "they mainly originate from the production of mixed neutralino pairs @xmath12 , stau pairs as well as chargino pairs .",
    "the latter undergo the subsequent decays to stau and lsp or tau and sneutrino .",

    "isr and beamstrahlung are always included . the ` presel . '",
    "column includes a @xmath14 cut for the final electron to cut out collinear regions , and for the @xmath15 sm as well as all @xmath16-induced processes a @xmath17 cut for particles vanishing in the beampipe .",

    "[ tab:500gevxsec ] , the most severe background ( that exceeds the signal by a factor @xmath18 ) comes from gamma - induced @xmath19 and @xmath11 pairs which produce a soft @xmath20 system with small total transverse momentum @xmath21 and large angular separation @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , a cut on transverse momentum of leptons and a cut on azimuthal separation of @xmath23 and @xmath19 reduces gamma - induced backgrounds by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "the other large source of sm background  @xmath24 pair production  can be reduced by applying an upper cut on the lepton energy , since most leptons from @xmath8 decays have energies larger than 40  gev .",
    "we also require two well - visible leptons in the central part of the detector .",
    "all cuts are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : cutsall ] .",

    "a fit of the collider data to samples of mc data for varying sneutrino mass ( assuming masses of other particles known ) allows one to determine the sneutrino mass with an accuracy of @xmath27  gev .",
