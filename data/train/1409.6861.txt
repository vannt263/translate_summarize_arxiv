    "the standard picture of thermal plasmas associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) is that the state of the gas appears to be either an ionizing plasma ( ip ) for young or intermediate aged snrs ( e.g.  kepler s snr , kinugasa and tsunemi 1999 ) , or plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) for old snrs ( e.g. 30 dor c , yamaguchi et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , recent x - ray observations have revealed several snrs are in recombination - dominated phase ( ic 443 , yamaguchi  2009 ; w49b , ozawa  2009 ; g359.1@xmath20.5 , ohnishi  2011 ; w28 , sawada & koyama 2012 ; w44 , uchida  2012 ; g346.6@xmath20.2 , yamauchi  2013 ) .",
    "these recombining plasmas ( rps ) have an ionization temperature ( @xmath3 ) higher than the electron temperature ( @xmath4 ) ; @xmath3 is a useful parameter defined to be the temperature which would be required to ionize the plasma to the same degree assuming that the plasma is in cie .",
    "the discovery of rps at snrs requires us to modify the conventional evolution scenario of snrs .",
    "3c 391 ( g31.9 + 0.0 ) is a bright galactic snr displaying diffuse x - ray emission close the center of its radio shell and is classified as a mixed - morphology snr ( mm - snr ) ( reynolds & moffett 1993 ) .",
    "the radio shell with a radius of has the shape of a partial circle in the northwest ( nw ) part and there is a faint extended structure in the southeast ( se ) region .",
    "this suggests a break - out morphology into a lower density region from the main snr shell .",
    "the detection of two oh maser spots at 1720  mhz from 3c 391 by frail  ( 1996 ) indicates an interaction with molecular clouds .",
    "they also reported a possibly extended oh emission at the edge of the nw shell .",
    "the velocity of two maser spots ( 105 and 110  km  s@xmath5 ) agrees with a previous study of h absorption velocity ( radhakrishnan  1972 ) .",
    "h observations show that the distance to 3c 391 is between 7.2  kpc and 11.4  kpc , assuming a distance to the galactic center of 8.5  kpc .",
    "the surrounding molecular gas of 3c 391 can be traced by co ( j @xmath6 1@xmath70 ) emission at velocities from 90 to 110  km  s@xmath5 ( wilner  1998 ) .",
    "the results of the co observation support the early expansion of 3c 391 inside a dense molecular cloud and the breakout of the blast wave to the se region .",
    "knowledge of the astrophysical environment around snrs is of great importance in order to reveal the origin of the rps in the context of the snr evolution .",
    "interestingly , most of the rp snrs are mm - snrs that interact with molecular clouds and are associated with bright gev gamma - ray emissions ( ic 443 , abdo  2010a ; w28 , abdo  2010b ; w49b , abdo  2010c ; w44 abdo  2010d ) .",
    "while some young snrs show bright tev gamma - rays ( rx j1713.7 - 3946 , aharonian  2004 ) , middle - aged snrs are usually found to be predominantly emitting in the gev energy band . a significant excess ( 13@xmath8 ) of gev gamma - rays at the position of 3c 391 with fermi - lat",
    "was reported by castro & slane ( 2010 ) .",
    "the radio rim of the nw region and the closer oh maser spot are apart from the gev emission peak in the test statistic map .",
    "the gev emission associated with 3c 391 probably arises from accelerated cosmic rays in the shock - heated molecular clouds .",
    "the interaction with the molecular gas and the association of the gamma - ray emission would be the keys for understanding the morphology and spectrum of the thermal plasmas in rp snrs .    in this paper , we report on an x - ray study of snr 3c 391 , taking advantages of low and stable in - orbit background and high sensitivity of the suzaku x - ray observatory ( mitsuda  2007 ) .",
    "we construct a model for the galactic background emission to complement the poor photon statistics , then we fit several plasma models to the x - ray spectrum of 3c 391 .",
    "our observation data is a part of the suzaku key project to search for rps in galactic snrs .",
    "section 2 describes the observation and data reductions and section 3 presents the data analysis .",
    "then , we interpret our results in section 4 and conclude in section 5 .",
    "we observed snr 3c 391 for an exposure time of 100 ks with the suzaku satellite in 2010 october 2224 during the ao5 cycle .",
    "this observation was performed as one of the key project observations aimed at systematic search for rps .",
    "the pointing position was ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) = ( 282.3812 , @xmath20.9417 ) . the observation instrument we used is the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; koyama  2007 ) , x - ray charge coupled device ( ccd ) cameras on the focal plane of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; serlemitsos  2007 ) .",
    "xis0 and 3 are front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds , and xis1 is a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd . the xis was operated with the normal - clocking , full - frame mode . since",
    "in - orbit radiation damage has degraded the charge transfer efficiency of the xis , the spaced - row charge injection technique is applied for the xis .",
    "we reprocessed the xis data with the latest calibration results instead of using the cleaned events .",
    "we used the headas software of version 6.13 ( suzaku software of version 20 ) .",
    "the calibration database ( caldb ) released on 2013 march was used for data processing .",
    "we adopted standard event selection criteria for suzaku xis data processing .",
    "we excluded events in the intervals of the south atlantic anomaly , low - earth elevation angles less than 5 degrees and the day earth elevation angle less than 20 degrees .",
    "after the data screening , the effective exposure time is about 99.4  ks .",
    "the data of the two editing mode , 3@xmath113 and 5@xmath115 pixel events , were combined , and then we removed flickering and hot pixels of the xis .",
    "x - ray diffuse emission is clearly detected in the central region of the remnant and is encompassed by the radio rim in the nw .",
    "figure  [ fig : image xis3 ] shows an x - ray image of 3c 391 ( xis3 only ) , after correcting the vignetting effect and subtracting the instrumental background ( the so - called non x - ray background , or nxb ) .",
    "the nxb was estimated by using xisnxbgen ( tawa  2008 ) .",
    "8 pixels ( @xmath11 ) were summed and smoothed with a gaussian kernel of @xmath12 .",
    ", width=264 ]    the northwest ( nw ) region associated with the radio rim has harder x - rays than the southeast ( se ) region .",
    "it indicates the difference of the thermal plasma or circumstellar matters between those regions .",
    "we thus divided the image into two regions : the nw and se region .",
    "3c 391 is located on the galactic plane , and hence the major background component is the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) , whose x - ray flux strongly depends on the position ( e.g. uchiyama  2011 , 2013 ) . since the photon statistics of the background region ( surrounding region of 3c 391 in the same xis field ) is not good enough due to the limited exposure time and the effective area , subtracting the background data from the source data results in large statistical errors in the snr spectrum .",
    "we therefore constructed a background model for the grxe .",
    "we extracted the background spectrum from the region excluding 3c 391 in the same field of view , and fitted the grxe model compiled by uchiyama  ( 2013 ) to the spectrum . in this background region , a few percent level of photon contamination from 3c 391 , which is due to the leakage of the xrt point spread function into the background region , can not be neglected .      in order to construct the background model , we need to make phenomenological models both for the source and the background regions .",
    "we extracted spectra from the whole 3c 391 region and the background region after subtracting the nxb .",
    "after the vignetting correction , we subtracted the background spectrum from the 3c 391 spectrum .",
    "the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) and the ancillary response file ( arf ) were created by xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen , respectively ( ishisaki  2007 ) .",
    "we used the spectral analysis software xspec version 12.8.1 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we simultaneously fitted all the xis0 , 1 , and 3 data with a single model .",
    "the energy band from 1.7 to 1.8  kev were ignored because of the calibration uncertainty around the si k edge .",
    "we then modeled the spectra by using a phenomenological model : the continuum x - ray emission is described by bremsstrahlung with temperature of @xmath13 and line emissions from various ionized atoms are given by gaussian lines .",
    "the interstellar photoelectric absorption was estimated using the cross sections by morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) with h column density @xmath14 .",
    "this phenomenological model successfully reproduces the data ( @xmath15 404.01/307 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec phenom ] and table  [ tbl : par phenom ] show the best - fit spectrum and parameters , respectively .",

    "the x - ray spectrum of 3c 391 is represented by two plasma models : a low temperature cie and a high temperature rp .",
    "the cie plasma is probably emitted by the ism heated by the blast waves , because it has 1 solar abundances .",
    "the abundances of the rp are given in figure  [ fig : mass ] , together with some theoretical model of ia ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) and core - collapse supernova ( cc sn ; woosely and weaver 1995 ) .",
    "although the error is large , the abundance pattern except fe is similar to a cc sn of progenitor mass of @xmath2815  .",
    "thus we regard that the rp has an ejecta origin from a cc sn of a @xmath2815  progenitor star . in section 4.1 , we discuss consistency of the observed data with this assumption .",
    "the abundance of fe in ejecta largely depends on the mass cut of the cc sn .",
    "if a major fraction of fe would be captured into a collapsed object ( neutron star or black hole ) in the case of 3c 391 , a small abundance of fe in the ejecta would be reasonable , unless the explosion is highly asymmetric as is demonstrated by yasumi et al .",
    "another possibility is that only a small fraction of the fe - rich ejecta has been shocked by the reverse shock ( fe - rich ejecta are expected to be located at the very inner part of the remnant ) . since the fe abundance estimated using the fe - l lines only has a large uncertainty due to their incompleteness , we can not conclude why the abundance of fe is lower than expected .",
    "the recombination parameter ( @xmath29  @xmath22  s ) is the largest among any rp discovered so far in mm - snrs ( yamaguchi  2009 , 2012 , ozawa  2009 , ohnishi  2011 , sawada & koyama 2012 , uchida  2012 , yamauchi  2013 ) .        the spectra of the se and nw also show the rp . since the extended oh emission reported in the nw region suggests the interaction with molecular clouds , the slightly higher @xmath14 than the se would be reasonable .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath30 and @xmath31 show no significant difference between the two regions .",
    "we found a hint of line emission at 6.4 kev , fe  k@xmath0 line at @xmath1 level from the se region , and not from the nw region where the snr interacts with molecular clouds .",
    "however the se region is coincident with oh masers .",
    "one possibility is that the fe  k@xmath0 line is due to low energy cosmic - ray electrons , which are preferentially made in the se region .",
    "the gyro radius of the lower energy electrons is extremely small , and hence diffusion length is far smaller than the snr size .",
    "the absence of the fe  k@xmath0 line at the nw , where cool gas is denser than the se , would be due to this limited diffusion length .",
    "deeper observations of hard x - ray will probably detect bremsstrahlung by low energy cosmic - rays interacting with molecular clouds . in any case , the detection of fe  k@xmath0 line is marginal , thus we need more detailed observations in the future .",
    "the abundances and emission measure of rp given in table 3 are based on the h dominant plasma .",
    "we assume that the rp originates from an ejecta of @xmath2815  progenitor ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) , which indicates super - solar abundances even for the light elements such as he , o and ne . the estimations of emission measure and abundances of heavy elements largely depend on the abundances of he , o and ne ; large abundances of these light elements enhance the continuum ( mainly bremsstrahlung ) flux , although the relative spectral shape is not affected because emission lines of he  ne are absent in the relevant energy band of 1.27.0  kev .",
    "we thus re - estimate the emission measure and abundances of heavy element assuming the light element mass distribution is the same as the progenitor star of 15 .",
    "the abundances of mg  ca relative to si in the rp component do not change from the original h dominant plasma but the averaged abundance of si  fe relative to hydrogen becomes @xmath2815 solar , confirming its ejecta origin .",
    "the emission measure becomes @xmath32  @xmath22 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are a filling factor and the snr distance in the unit of 8  kpc , respectively .",
    "the ratio of the electron to the atomic hydrogen densities is @xmath35 and the number ratio of all the elements to hydrogen is 2.0 . adopting the source radii of @xmath36  pc ,",
    "the ejecta mass is estimated to be @xmath37  . as is seen in figure 1 of chen  2004",
    ", filling factor would be very small , hence we assume @xmath33 is in the range of 0.30.1 . then the ejecta mass is @xmath28 1025  .",
    "this value is consistent with the initial assumption that 3c 391 is a remnant of cc sn with a progenitor mass of @xmath28 15 .",
    "the ionization age of the rp is estimated using @xmath38 .",
    "the electron density @xmath19 is @xmath39  @xmath22 .",
    "then the elapsed time @xmath40 is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) years , which place this snr as a rather old snr .",
    "if we assume a small filing factor , the age of @xmath43 yr estimated by chen & slane ( 2001 ) has a very similar value .",
    "several scenarios are proposed to explain the formation of rps in snrs .",
    "one is the rapid electron cooling by the thermal conduction from cold matters around snrs ( kawasaki  2002 ) or the adiabatic rarefaction ( itoh and masai 1989 , shimizu  2012 ) .",
    "the other is the ionization by the suprathermal or non - thermal particles ( masai  2002 , ohnishi  2011 ) or the high energy photons ( kawasaki  2002 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of rp in 3c 391 means that the plasma experienced the rapid electron cooling or extra - ionization .",
    "we first discuss the electron cooling scenario .",
    "if the electron cooling is due to thermal conduction , a timescale of the thermal conduction is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the temperature gradient scale length ( kawasaki et al .",
    "this timescale is much longer than the estimated age of 3c 391 , therefore the thermal conductivity is unlikely to produce the whole rp in 3c 391 of which the radius is about 7  pc .",
    "next scenario is rarefaction , which is the possible origin of the rp in w28 ( sawada & koyama 2012 ) .",
    "if the progenitor of 3c 391 was a massive star with a strong stellar wind activity , there can be a dense circumstellar media ( csm ) surrounding the ejecta .",
    "the blastwave breaking out of the shell can lead to rarefaction of the pi or near cie plasma .",
    "thereafter the electron temperature can drop rapidly due to adiabatic expansion but the ionization states can stay more or less the same . this scenario is supported by the fact that the recombination timescale is close to the putative age of 3c 391 . while reynolds and moffett ( 1993 ) estimated that the shell  break - out \" occurred at about 1600  yr after the supernova , the blast wave breaks out of the csm at only @xmath28100  yr ( itoh and masai 1989 , shimizu  2012 ) .",
    "since no significant spectral differences except the possible presence of a 6.4  kev line in the nw and a slightly larger @xmath46 in the se , we argue that the rarefaction of ejecta plasma was roughly symmetrical , unlike w49b as suggested by some models ( e.g. miceli et al 2010 ) .",
    "our results show that the rp of 3c 391 was produced by the  break - out \" from the csm and evolved independently from the interstellar environment . for 3c 391",
    ", we apply a model of an early phase break - out ( shimizu et al .",
    "2012 ) , while zhou et al .",
    "2011 proposed a later phase break - out for w49b .",
    "this difference is due to their different circumstellar environments ; 3c 391 would have a denser and more compact csm compared to that of w49b .",
    "although the extra - ionization process could be an alternative interpretation , it is still impossible to identify the origin of rp with the present data alone .",
    "we hence encourage deeper observation of 3c 391 .",
    "we observed the middle - aged snr 3c 391 with suzaku for 100 ks .",
    "we generated a background model for the grxe and analyzed the x - ray spectrum of 3c 391 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized below :    * the x - ray spectrum of 3c 391 is well described by a cie+rp model .",
    "3c 391 has the highest @xmath30 value among the rp snrs ever discovered .",
    "this means the rp of 3c 391 approaches ionization equilibrium the most .",
    "* estimated progenitor mass of @xmath2815  roughly agrees with the x - ray emitting mass of the rp derived from the corrected emission measure .",
    "this means only the ejecta plasma is overionized .",
    "* the parameters of rp have no significant difference between the nw and se regions .",
    "thermal conduction is unlikely to be the origin of the rp at 3c 391 .",
    "the symmetrical evolution of rp is consistent with a rarefaction of the plasma in the early phase . in order to draw a more conclusive picture",
    "we need deeper observations with more sensitive instruments , such as those to be onboard the astro - h mission ( takahashi  2010 ) . *",
    "our detailed analysis of the spectra of 3c 391 suggests a hint of fe  k@xmath0 emission at 6.4 kev ( @xmath47 ) , which can be explained by the interaction with a molecular cloud ."
