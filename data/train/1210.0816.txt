    "the study of the distribution of gaps in sequences is a subject that arises in many different contexts and has connections with many different areas of mathematics , including number theory , probability theory , and spectral analysis . in this paper , we study gap distributions from the perspective of dynamics and geometry , exploring examples connected with the dynamics of @xmath0-actions on moduli spaces of geometric objects , in particular the space of lattices and the space of translation surfaces .",
    "the inspiration for this article is the a quote from the beautiful paper of elkies - mcmullen  @xcite , referring to their explicit computation of the gap distribution of the sequence of fractional parts of @xmath2 , using the dynamics of the @xmath0-action on the space of _ affine unimodular lattices _ in @xmath3 .    _",
    "  the uniform distribution of lattices explains the exotic distribution of gaps . \" _",
    "indeed , the main results of our paper , theorem  [ theorem : meta ] , theorem  [ theorem : meta : period ] , and theorem  [ theorem : meta : circle ] , give unified explanations of several examples of ` exotic ' gap distributions via uniform distribution on various moduli spaces of geometric objects .",
    "suppose that for each positive integer @xmath4 , we are given a finite list of points @xmath5 , where by a _ list _",
    ", we mean a finite non - decreasing sequence of real numbers where @xmath6 denotes the number of terms in the @xmath7 sequence @xmath8 .",
    "we write @xmath9 and we assume @xmath10 as @xmath11 . in many situations , we are interested in the ` randomness ' of the sequence of lists @xmath12 .",
    "a first test of ` randomness ' is whether the lists @xmath8 _ uniformly distribute _ in @xmath1 , that is the measures @xmath13 converge weak- * to lebesgue measure , i.e. , for any @xmath14 , @xmath15 a more refined question ( not necessarily dependent on ( [ eq : equidist ] ) ) is to examine the distribution of _ gaps _ for the sequences @xmath8 .",
    "that is , form the associated _ normalized gap sets _ @xmath16 and given @xmath17 , what is the behavior of @xmath18 if the sequence @xmath8 is ` truly random ' , that is , given by @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are the order statistics generated by independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "uniform @xmath1 random variables @xmath21 , it is an exercise in probability theory to show that the gap distribution converges to a _ poisson process _ of intensity @xmath22 .",
    "precisely , for any @xmath23 , @xmath24 however , many sequences that arise ` in nature ' satisfy an equidistribution property but do not have poissonian gaps . following  @xcite , we call such gap distributions _ exotic_. in this paper , we discuss in detail some examples of exotic gap distributions , which , moreover , can be calculated ( or at least shown to exist ) using methods arising from homogeneous dynamics , in particular dynamics of @xmath0 actions on appropriate moduli spaces .",
    "in particular , the results we discuss share a similar philosophy ; the sets @xmath8 are associated to sets of angles or slopes of a discrete set of vectors in @xmath3 , and the gap distribution is studied by appropriate linear renormalizations , which can be viewed as part of an @xmath0 action on an appropriate moduli space of geometric objects .",
    "the main novelty of this paper is the statement of three meta - theorems ( theorem  [ theorem : meta ] , theorem  [ theorem : meta : period ] , and theorem  [ theorem : meta : circle ] ) , which give unified explanations of some of these examples by linking them to uniform distribution on various moduli spaces and which we expect can be used for future applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the remainder of this introduction we state results about our main ( previously studied ) examples : the farey sequences @xmath25 (  [ subsubsec : farey ] ) ; slopes for lattice vectors (  [ subsubsec : geomnum ] ) ; and saddle connection directions for translation surfaces (  [ subsubsec : saddle ] ) .",
    "we also briefly discuss the space of affine lattices and @xmath26 in  [ sec : affine ] . in ",
    "[ subsubsec : meta ] , we state the main results theorem  [ theorem : meta ] , theorem  [ theorem : meta : period ] , and theorem  [ theorem : meta : circle ] .",
    "we describe how to use these results to explain our examples in  [ sec : farey]-[sec : saddle ] , and prove the theorems in  [ sec : metaproof ] .",

    "consider the set of angles of lattice points of length at most @xmath99 , that is , @xmath119 to calculate the associated gap distribution @xmath120 , the key is to estimate the probability of finding multiple lattice points in ` thinning ' wedges .",
    "given @xmath121 and @xmath122 consider the wedge @xmath123 shown in figure  [ fig : thinning : wedge ] . here , the factor of @xmath124 corresponds to the normalizing factor @xmath125 above , since the cardinality of @xmath126 is on the order of @xmath127 .",
    "the gap distribution will be given by ( the second derivative ) of the limiting probability @xmath128 that this wedge does not affine lattice points .",
    "this follows from the fact that if we let @xmath129 denote the probability distribution function of the limiting gap distribution , we have @xmath130    ( 0,0 ) circle ( 2.5 cm ) ; ( 38:1)(38:2.5 ) ; ( 0:2.6)node[right]@xmath99 ;    ( 52:1)(52:2.5 ) ; ( 0,0 )  ( 38:2.5 ) arc ( 38:52:2.5)(52:3)node[above ] @xmath131  ( 0,0 ) ; ( 0,0)(45:3)node ; ( 38:2.5)(38:3)node[right ] @xmath132 ;    to compute @xmath133 , note that rotating the region @xmath134 by the element @xmath135 and scaling by @xmath136 ( with @xmath137 ) we obtain ( approximately ) the triangle @xmath138 with vertices at @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "thus , the probability that ( for a randomly chosen @xmath141 ) the region @xmath142 does not contain points from @xmath70 corresponds to the integral @xmath143 where @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 to understand the limits ( as @xmath99 , or equivalently @xmath146 ) of the integrals @xmath147 , we need to apply tools from ratner s theory of unipotent flows .",
    "it can be shown that these integrals converge to @xmath148 , where the limit measure @xmath149 can be shown to be invariant under a unipotent subgroup @xmath150 , following work of shah  @xcite . using ratner s theorem  @xcite , the possibilities for the measure @xmath149 are either :    * the haar probability measure @xmath151 * a probability measure supported on the set of torsion points @xmath152 $ ] ,",
    "that is , the support of the measure is restricted to affine lattices @xmath153 whose translation vector @xmath115 satisfies @xmath154 .",
    "depending on the properties of the initial affine lattice @xmath70 , torsion - supported measures can ( and do ) occur . as",
    "a consequence , the limiting gap distributions ( which can all be explicitly computed ) differ depending on the initial lattice , and in particular , whether the initial translation vector @xmath115 is a torsion point of the torus @xmath155 or not , and at what level  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.3 ) .      extraordinarily , the gap distribution for generic affine lattices @xmath70 ( that is , those for which the vector @xmath115 is not torsion , and so for which the limiting measure is haar ) coincides with the gap distribution for the sequence of fractional parts of @xmath156 .",
    "the reason they coincide is that both are coming from equidistribution of certain homogeneous trajectories with respect to the haar measure on the space @xmath157 .",
    "we strongly urge the reader to look at the beautiful paper  @xcite for further details on the connection of @xmath2 mod 1 to homogeneous dynamics .",
    "perhaps ironically , despite the inspiration for our paper being provided from their pithy quote , our theorems below do not seem to give a direct explanation of their result .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the common thread that runs through these results is the creation of associated discrete sets of @xmath3 and appropriate dynamical systems , which turns gap distribution questions into questions of equidistribution of orbits on certain moduli spaces . in this section ,",
    "we state our main results , theorem  [ theorem : meta ] , theorem  [ theorem : meta : period ] , and theorem  [ theorem : meta : circle ] , in a very general setting , to attempt to explain several of these phenomena simultaneously .",
    "we first fix notation and our general framework in  [ sec : setup ] , before stating theorem  [ theorem : meta ] and theorem  [ theorem : meta : period ] in  [ sec : theoremmeta : slope ] , and theorem  [ theorem : meta : circle ] in  [ sec : theoremmeta : angle ] .",
