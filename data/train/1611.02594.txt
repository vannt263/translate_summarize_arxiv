    "this allows to implement the four - body gauge constraints via appropriately designed two - body ising interactions between physical and ancilla qubits .",
    "here we consider a more general and robust form of @xmath30 , consisting of all combinations of two - body interactions along the edges and diagonals of the plaquette , as well as with the ancilla spin [ see fig .",

    "we turn to the technique of rydberg dressing  @xcite , where off - resonant laser light weakly admixes some rydberg character into a ground state level .",
    "specifically , we propose to couple the @xmath43 and @xmath56 states of rb and cs using single photon transitions to rydberg @xmath57 states @xcite . for large laser detunings the rydberg dressing acts as a perturbation .",

    "the large lifetimes of rydberg dressed atoms enable coherent quantum annealing as an alternative to the current paradigm of quantum enhanced thermal annealing  @xcite .",

    "finally , our proposal allows to realize atomic quantum simulators of arbitrary infinite - range ising spin glass models ( see e.g. refs . in @xcite ) , and the combination of multi - color rydberg - dressed interactions with two - species mixtures has applications in realizing @xmath89 lattice gauge theories beyond the present example  @xcite .",

    "<S> there is a significant ongoing effort in realizing quantum annealing with different physical platforms . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is to achieve a fully programmable quantum device featuring coherent adiabatic quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that combining the well - developed quantum simulation toolbox for rydberg atoms with the recently proposed lechner - hauke - zoller  ( lhz ) architecture allows one to build a prototype for a coherent adiabatic quantum computer with all - to - all ising interactions and , therefore , a novel platform for quantum annealing . in lhz </S>",
    "<S> a infinite - range spin - glass is mapped onto the low energy subspace of a spin-1/2 lattice gauge model with quasi - local 4-body parity constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this spin model can be emulated in a natural way with rubidium and cesium atoms in a bipartite optical lattice involving laser - dressed rydberg - rydberg interactions , which are several orders of magnitude larger than the relevant decoherence rates . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the exploration of coherent quantum enhanced optimization protocols accessible with state - of - the - art atomic physics experiments .            </S>",
    "<S> quantum annealing is a quantum computing paradigm with the aim to solve generic optimization problems @xcite , where the cost function corresponds to the energy of an infinite - range ising spin glass  @xcite . finding the optimal solution of the problem is thus equivalent to determining the ground state of the spin glass . in quantum annealing </S>",
    "<S> , this task is accomplished by adiabatic passage of a system of @xmath0 spins in the instantaneous ground state of a hamiltonian ( denoted _ logical spin model _ ) of the form @xmath1\\!. \\label{eq : hlogic}\\ ] ] here @xmath2 are pauli spin operators , and scheduling functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 deform @xmath5 from a trivial initial hamiltonian with @xmath6 and transverse local fields @xmath7 , into the spin glass hamiltonian with @xmath8 , where the optimization problem is encoded in local fields @xmath9 and infinite - range interactions @xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that implementing eq .   </S>",
    "<S> requires individually programmable long - range interactions @xmath11 , which is in contradiction to polynomially decaying interactions in cold atoms and molecule setups .    adopting the lhz architecture  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the infinite - range spin glass is translated to a lattice spin model , where new _ physical _ spins @xmath12 represent the relative orientation of two _ logical _ spins @xmath13 of eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> if two logical spins are aligned in parallel , i.e. @xmath14 or @xmath15 , then the corresponding physical spin is in state @xmath16 , while if the logical spins are aligned anti - parallel , i.e. @xmath17 or @xmath18 , then the physical spin is in state @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the major advantage of this approach is that the interaction energy of a pair of logical spins can now be implemented with a local field acting on a single physical spin .    </S>",
    "<S> a general optimization problem in the lhz architecture becomes @xmath20 with new schedule functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 and transverse fields @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> physical spins are arranged on a square lattice [ see blue spheres in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ] , where the index @xmath25 labels the entries of the matrix @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of physical spins @xmath26 equals the number of connections in the original model , which is quadratically larger than in the original problem   for all - to - all connected graphs ] . </S>",
    "<S> this enlarged state space contains states where collections of physical spins encode conflicting relative orientations of the logical spins . </S>",
    "<S> these states can be locally identified and energetically penalized by 4-body constraints @xmath27 at each plaquette   of the square lattice , such that at the end of the sweep plaquettes either contain all an even  @xcite , or all an odd  @xcite number of spins in the @xmath28 state , thus realising an even or odd parity representation of eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that the final ground state of the lhz hamiltonian   corresponds to the final ground state of the logical hamiltonian  , and thus to the optimal solution of the optimization problem . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the optimization problem is now encoded in _ </S>",
    "<S> local _ </S>",
    "<S> fields @xmath29 , corresponding to single particle energy shifts . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the above model for a programmable quantum annealer can be emulated in an atomic rydberg setup , which builds on the remarkable recent advances towards realizing complex spin models with cold atoms in lattices interacting via designed rydberg - rydberg interactions  @xcite . </S>"
