    "<S> the structure of the pseudo - binary mercury chalcogenide alloy hgse@xmath0s@xmath1 has been studied by x - ray and neutron powder diffraction at pressures up to 8.5 gpa . a phase transition from the cubic zinc blende structure to the hexagonal cinnabar structure </S>",
    "<S> was observed at @xmath2 1 gpa . a phenomenological model of this reconstructive phase transition based on a displacement mechanism is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the geometrical relationship between the zinc blende and the cinnabar phases has shown that the possible order parameter for the zinc blende - cinnabar structural transformation is the spontaneous strain @xmath3 . </S>",
