    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are close binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a less - compact companion that fills its roche critical lobe .",
    "the companion usually resembles a low - mass main sequence star .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if a star fills its roche critical lobe in a close binary , its mean density @xmath1 is inversely related to the orbital period @xmath2 , with little dependence on the masses of the two stars .",
    "along the main sequence , the mean density increases strongly with decreasing mass .",
    "consequently , the secondary stars in short - period cvs tend to resemble late m dwarfs . at periods shorter than @xmath3 4",
    "hr , the secondary is usually not detectable in the combined spectrum , because other sources of light overwhelm its feeble contribution . at longer periods ,",
    "the secondaries tend to be hotter , more luminous , and more conspicuous .",
    "the relationship between @xmath2 and the secondary spectral type @xmath4 is explored in detail by @xcite .",
    "some cvs depart radically from the typical @xmath4-@xmath2 relationship .",
    "if the secondary star is also a degenerate dwarf , the system is called an am cvn star ; these can have @xmath5 min . over a dozen examples",
    "are known @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with another cv subtype  the small number of short - period systems in which the secondary star not a white dwarf , but is significantly warmer than expected for the orbital period .",
    "ei psc (= 1rxs j232953.9 + 062814 ) has @xmath2 = 64 min , yet shows a conspicuous k - type secondary @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of qz ser is less extreme at 2.0 hours , but it too has a k - type secondary @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained time - series photometry of the 2.4-hour eclipsing system sdss j170213.26 + 322954.1 and derived a temperature for the secondary consistent with an m0 star , while the typical relation would predict @xmath3 m4 .",
    "@xcite found a spectral type of m1.5 @xmath6 1.1 for the secondary , marginally consistent with the @xcite result , and also hotter than expected for @xmath2 .",
    "the standard explanation for these warmer - than - expected secondaries is that mass transfer began after the secondary had consumed most of the hydrogen in the its core .",
    "this greatly alters the mass - luminosity - temperature ( @xmath7 ) relation , and in particular makes @xmath1 greater at a given surface temperature , which results in the departure from the usual @xmath4-@xmath2 relation .",
    "this idea is supported by evolutionary calculations @xcite and by indications of unusual abundances in the accreted material @xcite and in the secondary s photosphere . in particular",
    ", @xcite found unusually strong sodium absorption lines in the qz ser secondary spectrum , which they interpreted as evidence that the material had been processed at a temperature high enough to drive proton capture by @xmath8ne .",
    "one attractive feature of the evolved - secondary scenario is that , if the secondary were more massive than the primary when it first contacted its roche critical lobe , the subsequent mass transfer would have been unstable , leading to rapid shrinkage of the orbit .",
    "this could explain to the short periods observed @xcite .",
    "a stripped - core secondary also features in at least one neutron - star binary , namely ay sex ( firstj102347 + 003841 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the primary in this system is a 500 hz millisecond pulsar , and the secondary is a mid - g star . a recent vla parallax measurement by @xcite , combined with the constraints derived by @xcite ,",
    "give a secondary - star mass of only 0.24 m@xmath9 , so it is _ extremely _ undermassive for its spectral type .",
    "ay sex also shows some evidence of na enhancement @xcite .    here",
    "i report on a new member of this exclusive class , 1340 .",
    "this was discovered in the catalina real time survey ( crts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has turned up a very large number of new cv candidates @xcite . table [ tab : properties ] summarizes some pertinent information about the star .",
    "the crts light curve of this object shows with a white - light magnitude just fainter than 18th , and a single outburst to 14.5 magnitude starting 2010 may 31 . while the outburst behavior is unremarkable , the magnitude at minimum is unusually steady , varying by only a few tenths of a magnitude at most .",
    "most dwarf novae show much larger variations at minimum .",
    "all the observations are from mdm observatory , on kitt peak , arizona .",
    "spectra were obtained on 2013 mar .  3 , 4 , and 5 ut ; on the 5th , i also obtained simultaneous time - series photometry .",
    "the spectra are from the 2.4 m hiltner telescope and modular spectrograph , equipped with a 600 line mm@xmath10 grating and the site 1024@xmath11 ccd detector ` templeton ' .",
    "the region from 4660 to 6732   was covered at 2    pixel@xmath12 , and the 1.1-arcsec slit gave resolution somewhat better than 2 pixels fwhm .",
    "standard stars were observed in twilight when the weather was clear , but unfortunately many of the spectra of the program object were taken through thin cloud or in poor seeing , so not all are of good photometric quality .",
    "exposures of wavelength calibration lamps taken in twilight gave the base pixel - to - wavelength relation , which typically had rms residuals @xmath13  , and the reduction pipeline shifted this solution to force the [ oi ] @xmath14 line ( present in all the spectra ) to its rest wavelength .",
    "exposure times were mostly 720 s to suppress readout noise and minimize dead time .    the mean spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specs ] , top panel ) shows the absorption lines of a late - type star and weak emission at h@xmath15 .",
    "i estimated the spectral type and light fraction of the secondary by scaling and subtracting spectra of stars classified by @xcite and looking for the best cancellation of late - type features .",
    "this constrained the spectral type to be k4 @xmath6 2 subclasses .",
    "the secondary contributes most  possibly almost all  of the system s light .",
    "along with the observed spectrum , fig .",
    "[ fig : specs ] shows the result of subtracting a scaled k4 spectrum .",
    "the subtracted spectrum shows stronger h@xmath15 emission than the original , because even k stars have fairly strong h@xmath15 absorption , which masks the intrinsically weak emission line . also , nad is grossly undersubtracted .",
    "comparison with spectral type standards shows that the nad absorption in the original spectrum is roughly as strong as that in an m0 star .",
    "the sodium blend near @xmath165685 is also badly undersubtracted , and the na blend near @xmath166158 may also be enhanced , though in the latter case the strong cai lines near @xmath166160 complicate the interpretation .",
    "a similar apparent na enhancement is seen in the secondary of qz ser @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath15 line was too weak for radial velocity measurements , but the rich absorption spectrum yielded usable velocities for 34 of the 49 spectra ( table [ tab : velocities ] ) .",
    "these were measured using the cross - correlation routine _ xcsao _ in the _ rvsao _ package @xcite ; i used a velocity - compensated composite of g- and k - type velocity standards as a template .",
    "[ fig : montage2 ] shows the result of a period search of the velocities , using the sine - fitting method described by @xcite ; the orbital period is obvious . fitting a sinusoid of the form @xmath17 yields @xmath18 the middle panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : specs ] shows a greyscale representation of the data in the vicinity of the nad line .      on 2013",
    "march 5 ut , i obtained simultaneous time - series photometry with the mdm 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope and an andor ikon du-937n camera .",
    "the andor camera s sensor is a thinned , backside - illuminated , frame - transfer ccd ; the active area is has 512 @xmath19 512 , pixels , each 13 @xmath20 m square . binning this @xmath21 gave a 128@xmath11 data array subtending 139 arcsec on a side .",
    "exposures were 45 seconds through a schott gg420 filter , chosen to suppress scattered moonlight .",
    "the vendor - supplied _ solis _ software wrote the images as a fits data cube , which i reduced using python - languages programs based on pyfits @xcite and numpy .",
    "processing steps included subtracting bias and dark images , and dividing by a flat field derived from images of the twilight sky .",
    "the program star and several others were measured in each frame using the aperture photometry task _ phot _ from the iraf implementation of daophot .",
    "frames were centered southwest of the program object in order to include a comparison star 102 arcsec to the west and 89 arcsec south , which is @xmath22 mag brighter .",
    "intermittent cirrus clouds greatly degraded the signal - to - noise of some of the images , so images in which the comparison star was attenuated by more than @xmath23 mag were discarded from the analysis .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : montage2 ] shows the magnitudes relative to the comparison star , folded on the orbital ephemeris .",
    "a clear double - peaked modulation is present .",
    "comparison with the velocity curve shows that the fainter minimum coincides with inferior conjunction of the secondary , as expected for ellipsoidal variation .",
    "this modulation accounts for all the variation ",
    "the scatter around the ellipsoidal light - curve is comparable to the scatter in the measurements of similarly faint stars in the field .",
    "at @xmath24 hr , the @xmath4-@xmath2 relation for normal cvs predicts a secondary around m3 or m4 @xcite . at k4 @xmath6 2 ,",
    "the secondary is clearly well to the warm side of the curve .",
    "the apparent na enhancement reinforces the resemblance to qz ser .",
    "1340 joins the exclusive club of stripped - core secondaries .",
    "the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variation is fairly small , so the inclination is fairly close to face - on . to quantify this , i adapted the computer code developed by @xcite ( to model the ay sex light curve ) to the present case .",
    "the icosahedral tesselation of the secondary star , surface - brightness / color / effective - temperature relations , and prescriptions for limb- and gravity - darkening were unchanged .",
    "i adopted @xmath25 kelvin as appropriate for a k4v photosphere @xcite .",
    "the primary star s luminosity ( which heats one face of the ay sex secondary ) was turned off , but to account for a possible accretion disk contribution i added extra light comprising about 15 per cent of the system s light , guided by the spectral decomposition in fig .  [ fig : specs ] ( top panel ) . in the original case of ay sex , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 bands light curves were available , but the present data are in white light , so the color - fitting portions of the code were turned off .",
    "i assumed that the white - light behavior is represented adequately by a @xmath27-band model , which seems reasonable given the available signal - to - noise .",
    "i assumed further that the light curve oscillates around @xmath29 , from the data in table [ tab : properties ] .",
    "a model with @xmath30 m@xmath31 , @xmath32 m@xmath31 , and an inclination @xmath33 degrees gave excellent agreement , both with the light curve and the observed velocity amplitude . assuming a reddening @xmath34 @xcite",
    ", the @xmath29 normalization puts this model at 790 pc .",
    "this distance will scale approximately as the secondary mass to the 1/3 power , and inversely with the surface brightness , which increases steeply with the assumed effective temperature .",
    "this model is not intended to be unique , but rather to check whether the available information supports a primary star mass in the white dwarf range , which it evidently does .",
    "it is interesting that only one outburst has been observed .",
    "ei psc and qz ser also outburst rarely . in the absence of an outburst ,",
    "an object similar to 1340 would be inconspicuous .",
    "this raises the question of how many similar objects may remain undetected .",
    "the optical spectrum is dominated by a k star , with weak emission , so emission line surveys such as iphas @xcite would not see it .",
    "color - based surveys would fare no better ; the optical colors ( table  [ tab : properties ] ) are typical of k stars @xcite , and even the @xmath35 color does not stick out .",
    "it seems likely , then , that a sizeable number of these objects remain undetected .",
    "this may change in the future ; the large synoptic survey telescope should be capable of detecting quiescent objects of this kind through their ellipsoidal variation",
    " most will be closer to edge - on than this one  or through eclipses .",
    "the gaia astrometric satellite may also contribute , since the secondary stars in similar objects are likely to have radii significantly smaller than normal stars of the same color , leading to distances that are anomalously small for the color and apparent magnitude .",
    "it also may be significant that this object has a period squarely in the middle of the so - called ` period gap ' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the interval @xmath36 where relatively few cvs ( especially non - magnetic dwarf novae ) are found .",
    "interestingly , sdss j170213.26 + 322954.1 , the warm - secondary eclipsing system noted in the introduction , is also well within the gap at almost the same @xmath2 , 2.4 hr @xcite .",
    "a popular explanation for the gap , the _ disrupted magnetic braking _ scenario , is as follows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . cvs evolve to shorter periods by angular momentum loss , their secondaries become distended because they go out of thermal equilibrium as mass is removed from their surfaces . around 3 hr ,",
    "an abrupt change in the angular momentum loss ( usually thought to involve a reconfiguration of the secondary s magnetic field ) quenches the angular momentum loss , causing the secondary to relax back toward its natural radius and detach from the roche lobe .",
    "the system evolves slowly across the gap due to more gradual angular momentum loss , and lights up again around 2 hr as the roche lobe squeezes down onto the secondary .",
    "1340 is relatively quiescent , but it is not entirely so  it shows h@xmath15 emission and erupted in the recent past .",
    "unless mass transfer is being driven through some mechanism other than roche overflow , it must be very close to its roche lobe .",
    "disrupted magnetic braking would require that a cv in the middle of the gap be well - detached from its roche lobe , so this system must have evolved differently . as @xcite suggest , it is possible that the system was dropped into nearly its present configuration in a sudden episode of mass loss driven by dynamical - timescale mass transfer .",
