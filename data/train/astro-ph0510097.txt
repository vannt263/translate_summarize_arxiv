    "observations of rotation curves of spiral galaxies and measurements of the velocity dispersions of stars in early - type galaxies have provided important evidence for the existence of massive dark matter halos around galaxies ( e.g. , van albada & sancisi 1986 ) .",
    "in addition , these studies have presented evidence of tight relations between the baryonic and dark matter components ( e.g. , tully & fisher 1977 ; faber & jackson 1976 ) .",
    "results based on strong lensing by galaxies support these findings ( e.g. , keeton , kochanek & falco 1998 ) .",
    "the origin of these scaling relations must be closely related to the process of galaxy formation , but the details are still not well understood , mainly because of the complex behaviour of the baryons .",
    "furthermore , on the small scales where baryons play such an important role , the accuracy of cosmological numerical simulations is limited .",
    "this complicates a direct comparison of models of galaxy formation to observational data . for such applications , it would be more convenient to have observational constraints on quantities that are robust and easily extracted from numerical simulations .",
    "an obvious choice is the virial mass of the galaxy , but most techniques for measuring mass require visible tracers of the potential , confining the measurements to relatively small radii .",
    "fortunately , recent developments in weak gravitational lensing have made it possible to probe the ensemble averaged mass distribution around galaxies out to large projected distances .",
    "the tidal gravitational field of the dark matter halo introduces small coherent distortions in the images of distant background galaxies , which can be easily detected in current large imaging surveys .",
    "we note that one can only study ensemble averaged properties , because the weak lensing signal induced by an individual galaxy is too small to be detected .    since the first detection of this so - called galaxy - galaxy lensing signal by brainerd et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the significance of the measurements has improved dramatically , thanks to new wide field ccd cameras on a number of mostly 4 m class telescopes .",
    "this has allowed various groups to image large areas of the sky , yielding the large numbers of lenses and sources needed to measure the lensing signal .",
    "for instance , hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used 45.5 deg@xmath11 of @xmath12-band imaging data from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) , enabling them to measure , for the first time , the extent and flattening of galaxy dark matter halos , providing strong support for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm .",
    "however , the analysis presented in hoekstra et al . (",
    "2004 ) was based on the @xmath12-band data alone , and consequently lacked redshift information for the individual lenses .",
    "an obvious improvement is to obtain redshift information for the lenses ( and if possible the sources ) .",
    "this allows one to study the lensing signal as a function of lens properties , most notably the luminosity .",
    "photometric redshifts were used by hudson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to scale the lensing signal of galaxies in the hubble deep field , and by wilson et al .",

    "smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used spectroscopic redshifts , but the lens samples involved were rather small ( @xmath13 ) . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "combines both survey area and redshift information .",
    "its usefulness for galaxy - galaxy lensing was demonstrated clearly by fischer et al .",
    "more recently , mckay et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used the available sdss redshift information to study the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal as a function of galaxy properties ( also see guzik & seljak 2002 ; seljak 2002 ; sheldon et al .",

    "in this paper we use a subset of the rcs data , for which photometric redshifts have been determined using @xmath14 and @xmath15 data taken using the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( see hsieh et al . 2005 for details ) .",
    "the area covered by these multiwavelength data is approximately 33.6 deg@xmath11 , resulting in a catalog of @xmath16 galaxies for which a redshift could be determined , making it one of the largest data sets of its kind .",
    "this unique data set allows us to measure the virial masses of galaxies as a function of their luminosity .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly discuss the data , including the photometric redshift catalog and its accuracy .",
    "the results of some basic tests of the photometric redshifts are presented in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the dark matter profile inferred from numerical simulations . the measurement of the virial mass as a function of luminosity in various filters is presented in  5 , as well as our measurement of the baryon fraction in galaxies . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and a hubble parameter @xmath19 km / s / mpc .",
    "the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) is a galaxy cluster survey designed to provide a large sample of optically selected clusters of galaxies in a large volume ( see gladders & yee ( 2005 ) for a detailed discussion of the survey ) . to this end",
    ", 92 deg@xmath11 of the sky were imaged in both @xmath12 and @xmath15 using the cfh12k camera on cfht and the mosaic ii camera on the ctio blanco telescope .",
    "this choice of filters allows for the detection of clusters up to @xmath20 using the cluster red - sequence method developed by gladders & yee ( 2000 ) .",
    "after completion of the original rcs survey , part of the surveyed area was imaged in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 band using the cfht .",
    "this additional color information allows for a better selection of clusters at lower redshifts .",
    "these follow - up observations cover @xmath21 deg@xmath11 , thus covering @xmath22 of the cfht fields .",
    "the data and the photometric reduction are described in detail in hsieh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy lensing results presented in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were based on 45.5 deg@xmath11 of @xmath12-band data alone .",
    "the addition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 imaging data for 33.6 deg@xmath11 to the existing @xmath12 and @xmath15 data allow for the determination of photometric redshifts for both lenses and sources in this subset of rcs imaging data .",
    "this enables the study of the lensing signal as a function of the photometric properties of the lens galaxies ( i.e. , color and luminosity ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on this multi - color subset of the rcs .    to determine the restframe @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 luminosities we use template spectra for a range in spectral types and compute the corresponding passband corrections as a function of redshift and galaxy color ( this procedure is similar to the one described in van dokkum & franx 1996 ) .",
    "provided the observed filters straddle the redshifted filter of interest , which is the case here , this procedure yields very accurate corrections .",
    "the cfht @xmath12 images are used to measure the shapes of galaxies used in the weak lensing analysis .",
    "the raw galaxy shapes are corrected for the effects of the point spread function , as described in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the resulting object catalogs have been used for a range of weak lensing studies ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b , 2002c , 2004 ) and we refer to these papers for a detailed discussion of the shape measurements .    the measurements of the lensing signal caused by large scale structure presented in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002a , 2002b ) are very sensitive to residual systematics .",
    "the various tests described in these papers suggest that the systematics are well under control . in this paper",
    "we use the shape measurements to measure the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal , which is much less sensitive to these observational distortions : in galaxy - galaxy lensing one measures the lensing signal that is perpendicular to the lines connecting many lens - source pairs .",
    "these are randomly oriented with respect to the psf anisotropy , and therefore residual systematics are suppressed .",
    "the determination of the photometric redshifts is described in detail in hsieh et al .",
    "the empirical quadratic polynomial fitting technique ( connolly et al . 1995 ) is used to estimate redshifts for the galaxies in the rcs data .",
    "the key component in this approach is the creation of a training set .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts from the cnoc2 survey ( yee et al .",
    "2000 ) are matched to the corresponding objects in the overlapping rcs fields .",
    "these data are augmented with observations of the goods / hdf - n field , for which the spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained using the keck telescope ( wirth et al .",
    "2004 ; cowie et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the photometry is from the ground - based hawaii hdf - n data obtained with the subaru telescope ( capak et al .",
    "this results in a final training set that includes 4,924 objects covering a large range in redshifts . to minimize the fitting errors arising from different galaxy types , hsieh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used a kd - tree method with 32 cells in a three - dimensional color - color - magnitude space .",
    "the resulting catalog contains @xmath16 galaxies with photometric redshifts .",
    "this catalog was matched against the catalog of galaxies for which shapes were measured .",
    "this resulted in a sample of @xmath23 galaxies with @xmath24 , that are used in the analysis presented here .",
    "comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts shows that accurate photometric redshifts , with @xmath25 , can be derived in the range @xmath26 . at lower redshifts , the lack of @xmath27 band data limits the accuracy , whereas at higher redshifts photometric errors increase the scatter to @xmath28 ( see hsieh et al .",
    "2005 for more details ) .",
    "to study the halos of galaxies as a function of color and luminosity we select a sample of lenses at intermediate redshifts : we select galaxies with photometric redshifts @xmath3 and @xmath12-band magnitudes @xmath24 .",
    "this redshift range is well covered by the cnoc2 redshift survey at the bright end , and the redshift errors are relatively small . for the background galaxies we limit the analysis to galaxies with @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ dzlens ] shows the difference between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for different subsets of galaxies with photometric redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "panel  a shows the full sample , whereas panels b and c show the bright and faint halves respectively .",

    "however , the uncertainties in the photometric redshift determinations can be substantial , and as a result the observed distribution is broadened .",
    "we use the observed error distribution , assuming a normal distribution , to account for the redshift errors . for the best fit parameterization",
    "we find values of @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( fixed ) and @xmath36 , which yields a mean redshift of @xmath37 .",
    "this model redshift distribution ( which includes the smoothing by redshift errors ) is indicated by the smooth curve in figure  [ zdist]a .    in the weak lensing analysis ,",
    "objects are weighted by the inverse square of the uncertainty in the shear measurement ( e.g. , see hoekstra et al .",
    "2000 , 2002a ) .",
    "as more distant galaxies are fainter , they tend to have somewhat lower weights and the effective redshift distribution is changed slightly .",
    "the dashed histogram in figure  [ zdist]a shows the distribution weighted by the uncertainty in the shape measurement for each redshift bin .",
    "the best fit parameterized redshift distribution has parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( fixed ) and @xmath40 , which yields @xmath41 , only slightly lower than the unweighted case .",
    "hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002b ) presented constraints on the matter density @xmath42 and the normalization of the power spectrum @xmath43 by comparing cold dark matter predictions to the observed lensing signal caused by large scale structure .",
    "the derived value for @xmath43 depends critically on the adopted redshift distribution .",
    "hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002b ) used galaxies with @xmath44 and a redshift distribution given by @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which yields a mean redshift of @xmath48 .",
    "these parameters were based on a comparison with redshift distributions determined from the hubble deep fields .",
    "it is useful to examine how these assumptions compare to the rcs photometric redshift distribution for galaxies with @xmath44 , as displayed in figure  [ zdist]b .",
    "the best fit model , indicated by the smooth curve , has parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , implying a mean redshift of 0.65 , about 10% higher than used by hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the training set lacks a large number of objects beyond @xmath52 and @xmath53 . despite these shortcomings ,",
    "the mean redshift of sources appears higher than what was used in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , thus suggesting that their value for @xmath43 needs to be revised downwards .",
    "the suggested change in source redshift could reduce the value for @xmath43 from hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002b ) by about @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to robustly quantify the size of the revision .",
    "we stress that without further work on photometric redshifts for faint , high redshift galaxies , it will be difficult to interpret current and , most importantly , future cosmic shear results .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal examined in this paper is much less sensitive to the uncertainty in the redshift distribution of faint , distant galaxies , as most of the signal is caused by lenses at much lower redshifts .",
    "as mentioned above , to minimize uncertainties in our results further , we only use background galaxies with redshifts less than 1 , and select a sample of lenses with redshift @xmath3 .",
    "hsieh et al . ( 2005 ) present various tests of the accuracy of the photometric redshifts .",
    "comparison to the available spectroscopic data as well as comparing to other published distributions provides a clear way to quantify the uncertainties . in this section",
    "we discuss some additional tests , based on the fact that the amplitude of the lensing signal is a well known function of the source redshift .",
    "such a test provides a useful `` sanity '' check on the validity of the photometric redshift distribution .",
    "the azimuthally averaged tangential shear @xmath56 as a function of distance from the lens is a useful measure of the lensing signal ( e.g. , miralda - escud 1991 ) :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the mean surface density within an aperture of radius @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the mean surface density on a circle of radius @xmath59 .",
    "the convergence @xmath61 , or dimensionless surface density , is the ratio of the surface density and the critical surface density @xmath62 , which is given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the angular diameter to the lens . @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the source and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to define the parameter    @xmath67,\\ ] ]    which is a measure of how the amplitude of the lensing signal depends on the redshifts of the source galaxies .",
    "for instance , in the case of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model , the dimensionless surface density is    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the einstein radius . under the assumption of isotropic orbits and spherical symmetry ,",
    "the einstein radius ( in radians ) is related to the velocity dispersion and @xmath70 through    @xmath71    to test the photometric redshifts from the rcs , we use galaxies with photometric redshifts @xmath3 to define a sample of lenses .",
    "we compute the ensemble averaged tangential shear around these galaxies ( i.e. , the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function ) as a function of source redshift .",
    "brighter galaxies are expected to be more massive , and should be given more weight . to derive the lensing signal , we assume that the velocity dispersion scales with luminosity as @xmath72 , a choice which is motivated by the oberved slope of the @xmath0-band tully - fisher relation ( e.g. , verheijen 2001 ) .",
    "we select bins with a width of 0.1 in redshift , and measure the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function ( e.g. , see hoekstra et al .",
    "2004 ; sheldon et al . 2004 ) out to 10 arcminutes .",
    "this signal arises from the combination of the clustering properties of the lenses and the underlying dark matter distribution . in the remainder of the paper , while studying the properties of dark matter halos around galaxies , we limit the analysis to smaller radii and to ` isolated ' lenses .",
    "however , by extending the range of measurements in this section , the signal - to - noise ratio is higher .",
    "the signal is well described by a sis model for this range of scales ( as suggested by the reduced @xmath73 values for the fits ) .",
    "the resulting value for the einstein radius as a function of redshift for the background galaxies is presented in figure  [ re_zbg ] .",
    "we find a negligible lensing signal for galaxies at the redshift of the lenses , whereas it increases for more distant sources .",
    "for a given cosmology and a pair of lens and source redshifts the value of @xmath70 can be readily computed . however , the errors in the photometric redshift determination complicate such a simple comparison between the expected signal and the results presented in figure  [ re_zbg ] . as was the case for the photometric redshift distribution",
    ", the redshift errors will change the signal .",
    "for instance at low redshifts , higher redshift galaxies will scatter into this bin , thus increasing the lensing signal . at higher redshifts , lower redshift object will scatter upwards , lowering the signal .",
    "when comparing the observed signal to the signal expected based on the adopted @xmath74cdm cosmology we need account for these redshift errors . to this end",
    ", we create simulated catalogs .",
    "the first step is to compute a model lensing signal based on the observed photometric redshifts ( which are taken to be exact ) .",
    "we then create a mock catalog by adding the random errors to the redshift ( while leaving the lensing signal unchanged ) .",
    "these random errors are based on the observed distribution ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ dzlens ] ) .",
    "we measure the lensing signal as a function of redshift in the mock catalog .",
    "this signal , indicated by the solid line in figure  [ re_zbg ] can be compared directly to our actual measurements as it now includes the smoothing effect of redshift errors .",
    "figure  [ re_zbg ] shows that it traces the observed change in amplitude of the lensing signal very well .",
    "another useful experiment is to measure the lensing signal when the lenses and sources are in the same redshift bin .",
    "we note that this procedure enhances the probability that we measure the signal for galaxies which are physically associated .",
    "if satellite galaxies tend to be aligned tangentially ( radially ) this would also lead to a positive ( negative ) signal .",
    "the results from bernstein & norberg ( 2002 ) , based on an analysis employing spectroscopic redshifts , has shown that intrinsic tangential alignments are negligible .",
    "unfortunately , in our case , the much larger photometric redshift errors ( compared to spectroscopic redshifts ) effectively suppress this potentially interesting signal .",
    "in addition , for the rcs data , the interpretation of the signal requires a large set of spectroscopic redshifts to quantify the contributions of unassociated galaxies in each bin .",
    "instead , we use these measurements as a test of the photometric redshifts .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ re_zbin ] .",
    "panel  a shows the results for the tangential shear , whereas panel  b shows the results when the background galaxies are rotated by 45@xmath75 ( which is a measure of systematics ) . in both cases",
    ", we do not observe a significant signal .",
    "the lack of a signal in the tangential shear in this case implies that the errors in photometric redshifts are relatively small .",
    "if this were not the case , and higher redshift galaxies would contaminate the samples at lower redshifts , we would expect to observe a positive signal .",
    "one of the major advantages of weak gravitational lensing over dynamical methods is that the lensing signal can be measured out to large projected distances from the lens .",
    "however , at large radii , the contribution from a particular galaxy may be small compared to its surroundings : a simple interpretation of the measurements can only be made for ` isolated ' galaxies .    in practice , galaxies are not isolated , which is particularly true for bright , early - type galaxies . in their analysis of sdss data , guzik & seljak ( 2002 )",
    "quantified the contribution from clustered galaxies using a halo - model approach .",
    "as discussed in  5 , we follow a different approach by selecting relatively isolated galaxies . as a result ,",
    "our results are not strictly valid for the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "nevertheless , the selection procedure is well defined and can be readily implemented when comparing to numerical simulations .",
    "we limit the analysis to relatively small distances from the lens , thus ensuring that the signal is dominated by the lens itself . as a result",
    ", we need to adopt a model for the mass distribution to relate the lensing signal to the mass of the lens .",
    "our choice is motivated by the results of cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations .",
    "collisionless cold dark matter provides a good description for the observed structures in the universe .",
    "numerical simulations , which provide a powerful way to study the formation of structure in the universe , indicate that on large scales cdm gives rise to a particular density profile ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "we note , however , that there are still uncertainties regarding the slope at small radii and the best analytical description of the profile ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1999 ; diemand et al .",
    "2004 ; hayashi et al .",
    "2004 ; tasitsiomi et al .",
    "furthermore there is considerable scatter from halo to halo in the simulations .",
    "our observations , however , can not distinguish between these various profiles , and instead we focus on the commonly used nfw profile , given by    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the virial mass , which is the mass enclosed within the virial radius @xmath78 .",
    "the virial radius is related to the ` scale radius ' @xmath79 through the concentration @xmath80 . the function @xmath81 .",
    "one can fit the nfw profile to the measurements with @xmath77 and concentration @xmath82 ( or equivalently @xmath79 ) as free parameters .",
    "however , numerical simulations have shown that the average concentration depends on the halo mass and the redshift .",
    "hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) constrained the mass and scale radius of the nfw model using a maximum likelihood analysis of the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal , and found that the results agreed well with the predictions from simulations .",
    "we therefore adopt the results from bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who found from simulations that    @xmath83    it is good to note that individual halos in the simulations have a lognormal dispersion of approximately 0.14 around the median . for the virial mass estimates presented here , we will use this relation between mass and concentration , thus assuming we can describe the galaxy mass distribution by a single parameter .    by definition , the virial mass and radius",
    "are related by    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the mean density at the cluster redshift and the virial overdensity @xmath86 , with @xmath87 ( bryan & norman 1998 ) . for the @xmath74cdm cosmology considered here , @xmath88 .",
    "we also note that for the adopted @xmath74cdm cosmology the virial mass is different from the widely used @xmath89 .",
    "this mass is commonly defined as the mass contained within the radius @xmath90 , where the mean mass density of the halo is equal to @xmath91 ( i.e. , setting @xmath92 and @xmath93 in eqn .",
    "note , however , that other definitions for @xmath89 can be found in the literature as well .",
    "the expressions for the tangential shear and surface density for the nfw profile have been derived by bartelmann ( 1996 ) and wright & brainerd ( 2000 ) and we refer the interested reader to these papers for the relevant equations .",
    "as discussed above , we study a sample of lenses with photometric redshifts @xmath3 and @xmath24 .",
    "this first selection yields @xmath94 lenses .",
    "we split this sample in a number of luminosity and color bins and determine the virial radii from an nfw model fit to the observed lensing signal .    for bright galaxies the lensing signal on small scales",
    "is typically dominated by the dark matter halo associated with that galaxy . in the case of faint ( low mass ) galaxies , however , the signal can easily be dominated by contributions from a massive neighbor .",
    "note that this neighbor need not be physically associated with the lens , as all matter along the line - of - sight contributes to the lensing signal .",
    "we can study the relevance of the local ( projected ) density by measuring the lensing signal around a sample of ` faint ' lenses ( @xmath95 ) , as a function of the projected distance to the nearest ` bright ' lens ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this distance can be used as a crude measure of the density around the faint lens ( i.e. , the smaller the distance , the higher the density ) .    to this end",
    ", we split this sample of ` faint ' lenses into subsets based on their distance to the nearest bright galaxy .",
    "we fit a sis model to the ensemble averaged lensing signal out to 2 ( @xmath97kpc at the mean distance of the lenses ) for each bin .",
    "the reduced @xmath73 values for the best fit are all close to unity , indicating that the sis model provides a good fit to these observations .",
    "we found that limiting the fit to smaller radii did not change the results apart from increasing the measurement errors .",
    "figure  [ re_dist ] shows the derived value for the einstein radius as a function of the distance to the nearest bright galaxy .",
    "the results show a clear increase in lensing signal as the separation decreases , i.e. as the density increases .",
    "however , at separations larger than @xmath98 , the observed lensing signal appears to be independent of the density .",
    "larger data sets are required to make more definitive statements , but these findings suggest that we can measure the properties of ` isolated ' faint galaxies by limiting the sample to galaxies which are more than 30 arcseconds away from a brighter galaxy . although this is a rather strict selection for the faintest galaxies , bright galaxies can be surrounded by many faint galaxies and consequently are not truely isolated . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we present results based on the sample of ` isolated ' galaxies , unless specified otherwise .",
    "this selection reduces the sample of lenses to 94,509 galaxies .",
    "we split the sample of ` isolated ' lens galaxies into seven luminosity bins and measure the mean tangential distortion as a function of radius out to 2 arcminutes .",
    "we fit an nfw profile to these measurements , with the virial mass as a free parameter , as described in  4 .",
    "figure  [ gtprof ] shows the measurements of the tangential shear as a function of projected distance from the lens for the seven @xmath2-band luminosity bins .",
    "the results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters are very similar to the ones presented in figure  [ gtprof ] . to account for the fact that the lenses span a range in redshift , we have scaled the signal such that it corresponds to that of a lens at the mean lens redshift ( @xmath99 ) and a background galaxy at infinite redshift . in each panel in figure  [ gtprof ] the average restframe @xmath2-band luminosity for each bin is indicated ( in units of @xmath100l@xmath101 ) .",
    "the vertical scales in each of the panels in figure  [ gtprof ] are the same , and as the luminosity of the lenses increases we observe a clear increase in the strength of the lensing signal .",
    "the best fit nfw models for each bin are indicated by the dotted curves .",
    "note that the current observations can not distinguish between an nfw profile ( used here ) and other profiles such as the sis model .",
    "there are more faint galaxies relative to the number of bright galaxies and the errors in the photometric redshift estimates will have as the net effect of faint galaxies getting scattered to higher luminosity bins , hence biasing the mass at fixed luminosity to a lower value . to estimate the level of this bias we create mock catalogs .",
    "we assume a power - law mass - luminosity relation and compute the model lensing signal using the observed photometric redshifts of the lens and source galaxies .",
    "we analyse this ` perfect ' catalog and compute the virial masses as a function of luminosity .",
    "we then use the observed photometric redshift error distribution as a function of apparent magnitude ( see figure  [ dzlens ] ) to create a number of new catalogs where the random error is added to the redshift ( note that the lensing signal is not changed ) .",
    "these catalogs are also analysed and yield the ` observed ' virial mass as a function of luminosity .",
    "as expected , the resulting masses are smaller than the input masses and the change in mass depends on the luminosity .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ corfac ] for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2-band .",
    "different choices for the mass - luminosity relation ( within reasonable bounds ) yield very similar curves . to infer the correct virial mass , we scale the observed virial masses by these curves .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     observations of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) have yielded accurate measurements of the baryon fraction in the universe . based on wmap observations , spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtained @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "if we assume that baryons do not escape the dark matter overdensity they are associated with , the ratio of mass in baryons to the total mass of the halo is @xmath104 . in the following , we will also assume @xmath105=71/km / s / mpc , which is the currently favoured value .",
    "for the pegase salpeter model , this implies that the fraction of the mass in stars is @xmath106 ( average of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 value ) , whereas the scaled salpeter imf yields a lower value of @xmath107 .",
    "comparison with the value of @xmath108 from cmb measurements suggests that only @xmath109 and @xmath110 of the baryons are converted into stars for the standard and scaled salpeter imfs respectively .",
    "the actual results for the two filters considered here are indicated separately in table  [ tab_star ] by @xmath111 .",
    "table  [ tab_star ] also lists the average results when we consider blue and red galaxies separately .",
    "the implied star formation efficiencies for early - type galaxies are low .",
    "we note that similar efficiencies have been inferred for galaxy clusters ( e.g. , lin , mohr & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "interestingly , our results imply that late - type galaxies convert a @xmath112 times larger fraction of baryons into stars .",
    "this result is robust , as it does not depend much on the adopted imf .",
    "guzik & seljak ( 2002 ) also found a factor of @xmath112 difference in star formation efficiency between early and late - type galaxies , in good agreement with our findings .",
    "hence , these results provide very important , direct observational constraints on the relative star formation efficiency during galaxy formation for different galaxy types .",
    "these findings suggest that the mechanism for the formation of early type galaxies is somehow more efficient in removing gas compared to late type galaxies .",
    "ram pressure stripping might be more prevalent , given that early type galaxies are typically found in high density regions , or they might form while developing strong winds that blow out most of the baryons .    irrespective of the process responsible for ejecting baryons , the resulting galaxy will always have a stellar fraction which is greater or equal to the fraction of stars in its progenitors .",
    "if we consider the situation where early - type galaxies form through mergers , it is clear that not all early - type galaxies can be the result of merging the late - type galaxies studied in this paper .",
    "ejecting @xmath113 of the stars during the merger process might seem an option , but this is hard to envision without removing a similar fraction of the dark matter halo .",
    "hence , the progenitors of early - type galaxies must have had a low fraction of their mass in stars .",
    "this could be achieved if early - type galaxies ( or their progenitors ) formed early on without forming new stars at later times ( because they lost their gas ) and if later type galaxies sustained their star formation for a much longer time , thus building up a larger fraction of mass in stars .",
    "recent estimates of the star formation rates of high redshift galaxies , suggest a qualitatively similar picture , in which early - type galaxies formed the bulk of their stars very early on with a sharp drop in star formation rates at @xmath114 , and less massive ( late - type ) galaxies continue to form most of their stars at a later time and over a much longer period of time ( e.g. , mccarthy et al . 2004 ; juneau et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in addition to stars , galaxies contain some gas , which needs to be included if we are to do a full accounting of the visible baryon contents of galaxies .",
    "although the amount of molecular hydrogen is uncertain , the amount of neutral hydrogen is relatively well determined from 21 cm line studies .",
    "the relative amount of hi gas is a function of galaxy type , with late - type galaxies being more gas rich .",
    "we use the results from roberts & haynes ( 1994 ) for the @xmath115 ratio to estimate the amount of mass in gas ( correcting the hydrogen mass to account for the primoridial helium abundance ) .",
    "the inclusion of gas slightly raises the mass in detected baryons for the bluest galaxies but this component is negligible for the red galaxies . adding estimates for the amount of molecular hydrogen does not change the numbers either .",
    "the resulting fraction of the mass in baryons in galaxies , @xmath116 , is listed in table  [ tab_star ] as well . only for the blue galaxies , under the assumption of a standard salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ,",
    "is the baryon fraction marginally consistent with the value determined from observations of the cmb ( spergel et al .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , the results for this model should be considered upper limits to the baryon fraction , given that the stellar mass - to - light ratios are too high to fit rotation curves ( e.g. , bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "the results from the scaled imf from bell & de jong are probably more representative of the actual baryon fractions in galaxies , thus implying that a significant fraction of the gas must have been lost .",
    "we have measured the weak lensing signal as a function of restframe @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2-band luminosity for a sample of ` isolated ' galaxies , with photometric redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "this selection of relatively isolated galaxies minimizes the contribution of group / cluster halos and nearby bright galaxies .",
    "the photometric redshifts were derived by hsieh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) using @xmath117 photometry from the red - sequence cluster survey . to add to the extensive study described in hsieh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we confronted the photometric redshifts to tests that are unique to weak lensing .",
    "these results showed that the lensing signal around a sample of foreground galaxies scales with source redshift as expected .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution determined by hsieh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggests that the mean redshift of galaxies used in the measurement of the lensing signal by large scale structure ( hoekstra et al . 2002a ; 2002b )",
    "is somewhat higher than previously assumed .",
    "if correct , this would imply a somewhat lower value for the normalization of the matter power spectrum , @xmath43 , compared to the published results .",
    "the difference is expected to be less than @xmath118 , but with the current data we can not reliably quantify the size of the change .",
    "virial masses were determined by fitting an nfw model to the tangential shear profile .",
    "note , that intrinsic scatter in the mass - luminosity relation will result in an underestimate of the mean virial mass for a galaxy of a given luminosity , as suggested by tasitsiomi et al .",
    "( 2004b ) .",
    "the magnitude of this effect depends on the assumed scatter , and we have ignored this in our analysis .",
    "we found that the virial mass as a function of luminosity is well described by a power - law with a slope of @xmath119 , with similar slopes for the three filters considered here .",
    "this result agrees with other observational studies ( guzik & seljak , 2002 ) and predictions from semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 1999 ; benson et al .",
    "2000 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "2003 ) . for a galaxy with a fiducial luminosity of @xmath4l@xmath5 we obtained a mass @xmath120m@xmath7 . converting this result to match the filter and definition for the mass used by guzik & seljak ( 2002 ) , yields a mass of @xmath121 for a galaxy with a luminosity of @xmath122 , in agreement with guzik & seljak ( 2002 ) , who found @xmath123 .",
    "we examined the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars . to do so",
    ", we used the restframe @xmath124 color as a measure of the mean stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the color also provides a crude indicator of galaxy type ( e.g. , robert & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "we considered a standard and a scaled salpeter imf ( see bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "the latter is more realistic , whereas the former yields stellar mass - to - light ratios that are too high to fit rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "irrespective of the adopted imf , we found that the stellar mass fraction is about a factor of two lower for early - type galaxies , as compared to late - type galaxies . including the fraction of baryons in gas only increases the fraction of observed baryons slightly .",
    "hence , our results suggest that galaxy formation is very inefficient in turning baryons into stars and in retaining baryons .",
    "these results provide important , direct observational constraints for models of galaxy formation .    under the assumption that the scaled salpeter imf is correct ,",
    "our results imply that late - type galaxies convert @xmath9% of baryons into stars .",
    "early - type galaxies do much worse , with an efficiency of @xmath125% .",
    "this implies that the progenitors of early - type galaxies have a low fraction of their mass in stars .",
    "a possible explanation of this result is that early - type galaxies formed early on and stopped forming new stars , because they lost most of their baryons ( e.g. , through winds or ram pressure stripping ) .",
    "if later type galaxies , on the other hand , continued to form stars this would lead to a higher stellar mass fraction .",
    "such a scenario is , at least qualitatively , in agreement with recent estimates of the star formation rates of high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , mccarthy et al .",
    "2004 ; juneau et al . 2005 ) ."
