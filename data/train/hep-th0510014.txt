    "the massless sector from the 5d bulk also contains the states @xmath47 with @xmath48 under pati - salam or a color triplet plus anti - triplet , @xmath49 , under @xmath50 .",
    "these states are good news , since they are the necessary higgs needed for breaking pati - salam to the standard model gauge group .",
    "in fact , we have evaluated the 4d effective superpotential ( consistent with stringy selection rules ) up to a certain power in standard model singlets and we find @xmath51 this is just what is necessary to obtain f and d flat directions breaking @xmath52 to the @xmath53 and giving mass to all unwanted charged states under the standard model . * _ gauge coupling unification _ in a 4d gut we have the rg equations given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 gev , @xmath56 and we have included a threshold correction at @xmath57 , required in order to fit the low energy data when using the rg equations from @xmath58 to @xmath59 at two loop order .",
    "on the other hand , in our effective 5d orbifold gut we have the following rg equations : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ps breaking scale , @xmath62 is the 5d compactification scale , @xmath63 is the string scale and @xmath64 is the gauge coupling at the string scale .",
    "the coefficients @xmath65 are determined by the massive kk modes with the given parities , @xmath66 is given by the massless modes in the mssm , and the term @xmath67 is determined by the massless kk modes or the  brane \" ( massless fixed point states ) which get mass when the pati - salam symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "we can use the 4d rg equations to analytically fix some of the parameters in the 5d equations .",
    "note that the ( + + ) and ( @xmath68 ) kk modes are in the overlap of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , hence @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . as a consequence , @xmath72",
    "and we find @xmath73 gev .",
    "in addition , in the weakly coupled heterotic string we have the boundary condition @xmath74 where the first term is the tree level result and the second term ( a universal one loop stringy correction ) is negligible . by assuming the complete freedom to put non - trivial ps multiplets at either the string or the ps breaking scale we obtain a maximum value of @xmath63 given by @xmath75 which ( using eqn .",
    "[ eq : hetbc ] ) gives @xmath76 .",
    "this is a problem .",
    "one possible solution is to discard the weakly coupled heterotic string boundary conditions by approaching the strong coupling limit . in the strongly coupled limit",
    "we have the hoava - witten boundary conditions given by  @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is given in terms of the 11d newton s constant by @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the size of the eleventh dimension . now using eq .",
    "[ eq : witten ] , we find solutions for @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus we can accommodate gauge coupling unification .",
    "1 .   successful gauge coupling unification  @xcite 2",
    ".   an enhanced proton decay rate due to dimension-6 operators with the dominant decay mode @xmath84 .",
    "the decay rate for dimension-6 operators is given by  @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an input from lattice calculations of the three quark matrix element  @xcite .",
    "recent results give a range of central values @xmath87 .",
    "note , the present experimental bound for this decay mode from super - kamiokande is @xmath88 years at @xmath89 confidence levels  @xcite .",
    "thus this prediction is not yet excluded by the data , but it should be observed soon .",
    "3 .   3rd generation and higgs in the bulk implies gauge - yukawa unification ( which is a phenomenologically acceptable relation  @xcite ) , and 4 .",
    "@xmath33 family symmetry , which can generate a family hierarchy and suppress flavor violating interactions .      where @xmath91 are singlet operators under @xmath30 , but with non - trivial transformation properties under @xmath33 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath92 correspond to products of ( even , odd ) number of @xmath33 doublets .",
    "also we have defined the two composite operators @xmath93 where the group indices are arranged in all possible ways .",
    "hence , the structure of the yukawa matrix is determined by the @xmath33 family symmetry and the ps symmetry breaking vevs .",
    "the good news is that there are very few exotic states and they come in vector - like pairs .",
    "we list the exotics with their ps quantum numbers below .",
    "@xmath95 hence , in principle , all these states with fractional electric charge could get mass near the string scale , once singlet scalars obtain non - vanishing vevs .",
    "the potential problem with these states is that no fractional charged particles have ever been seen .",
    "they have not been produced in any high energy accelerators , thus they must be heavier than about several hundred gev . on the other hand , they have never been seen in mass spectrometer searches of thousands of gallons of sea water , looking for exotic states of hydrogen .",
    "the limits on exotic charged matter are of order @xmath96 in abundance compared with normal hydrogen  @xcite . of course , by charge conservation the lightest fractional charged state , if it existed , would be stable . thus such states could not have been produced in the early universe .",
    "hence they should be heavier than any reheat temperature after inflation . in this case",
    ", their present abundance would be low enough , so that they would not be observable today .",
    "the problem for this particular model is that one of the exotics is an oscillator mode , while its vector - like partner is not .",
    "we have searched for effective mass operators , to order power 8 in @xmath30 singlets and we can not find an operator which would give mass to the oscillator modes .",
    "i should note , that in other models discussed in the paper  @xcite , all of the exotics were non - oscillator modes and all could in principle obtain mass from effective mass operators .",
    "thus we conclude that this is a problem specific to this particular model and not generic",
    ". however , for this model this problem is a killer !        in the mssm , r parity is equivalent to family reflection symmetry [ frs ] in which all ordinary family superfields are odd ( @xmath98 ) and the higgs superfield is even ( @xmath99 ) . in order to preserve this symmetry ,",
    "even after pati - salam symmetry is broken , we need that the higgs which break ps are even under frs , i.e. ( @xmath100 ) . clearly with the superpotential ( eqn .",
    "[ rparity ] ) this symmetry is manifestly broken .",
    "hence r parity is broken in the effective low energy field theory .",
    "this may or not be a problem .",
    "it depends on whether or not the dimension 4 , r parity violating operators can be sufficiently suppressed to withstand the known limits .    however , we suggest that it may be possible to find models which have an exact low energy r parity . in this model",
    "cubic terms in the superpotential ( eqn .",
    "[ rparity ] ) of the form @xmath101 , where @xmath102 refers to untwisted sector states and @xmath103 refers to @xmath104 twisted sector states , are allowed by the stringy selection rules .",
    "the fields @xmath105 and @xmath106 come from the @xmath107 , @xmath108 sectors , respectively . perhaps in a different @xmath94 orbifold we would have the first term , but the second term would be forbidden at cubic order . in this case , the superpotential ( eqn . [ rparity ] ) might be replaced by @xmath109 with @xmath110 odd under frs",
    ". then , as long as @xmath110 does not develop a vacuum expectation value , r parity would be an exact symmetry of the effective low energy field theory .",
    "* we have presented a new 3 family @xmath14 orbifold gut which has an ultra - violet completion in the @xmath111 heterotic string .",
    "* the yukawa coupling , of the 3rd generation of quarks and leptons to the higgs , satisfies gauge - yukawa unification .",
    "this relation is very predictive .",
    "moreover it is not ruled out .",
    "* the model has a @xmath33 family symmetry .",
    "this symmetry can naturally explain the family hierarchy and also suppress flavor violation * the model includes a small number of vector - like exotics .",
    "unfortunately , in this particular model , it is not possible to give all the exotics mass .",
    "this is the super killer problem for this construction !",
    "the good news is that this problem was very specific to this particular model .",
    "other models we have constructed do not have this problem . *",
    "the model contains extra color triplets .",
    "these are a nuisance ; they are not necessarily a problem . in this model , these additional color triplets mediate r parity violating processes . * the model has no r parity .",
    "this is aesthetically unappealing .",
    "it however may be experimentally acceptable .",
