    "the approach of quantum spin systems to criticality is an interesting and rather underexplored problem in computational physics . in this paper",
    "we consider the critical behavior of one of the simplest quasi-1d quantum spin systems , the alternating heisenberg chain with spin-1/2 , as it approaches the uniform chain limit .",
    "this model is of special interest for the study of critical behavior , since much is known analytically about the gapless uniform - chain limit through the bethe ansatz .",
    "this system is also important for studies of the magnetic spin - peierls effect , and gives a reasonably accurate description of magnetic interactions in many dimerized quasi-1d antiferromagnets .",
    "the alternating heisenberg antiferromagnet is a simple generalization of the uniform heisenberg chain , with the nearest - neighbor exchange constant @xmath7 replaced by two alternating values .",
    "the spin-1/2 system is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath8 and has a spin - singlet ground state with energy @xmath9 and a nonzero singlet - triplet gap @xmath10 for any alternation@xcite @xmath11 .    for our study",
    "we introduce a finite - lattice , scaled ground - state energy per spin , @xmath12 and a corresponding singlet - triplet gap @xmath13 the tilde indicates that these energies are scaled by @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 , which would divide our results by a factor of @xmath16 ( _ albeit _ giving the same leading critical behavior ) .",
    "in addition , energies quoted with a single real argument and a tilde ( _ e.g. _ @xmath17 ) are bulk limits of the scaled alternating chain , those with no tilde and a single integer argument ( _ e.g. _ @xmath18 ) are finite-@xmath19 uniform chain results , and those with no arguments ( _ e.g. _ @xmath20 ) are bulk limits of the uniform chain .",
    "the uniform spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain , which we recover at @xmath21 , is the best understood 1d critical quantum spin system .",
    "it has a ground - state energy per spin of @xmath22 and a band of gapless spin - triplet excitations with dispersion relation @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the approach of noncritical models to this limiting case is not well established , and has been the subject of surprisingly few theoretical and numerical studies .",
    "early analytical studies of the effect of a small alternation @xmath3 on the uniform chain were reported by cross and fisher @xcite and black and emery @xcite .",
    "cross and fisher used a jordan - wigner transformation to map the original spin problem onto a pseudo - fermion hamiltonian , and approximated the latter by the exactly solvable luttinger - tomanaga model .",
    "this approach , which unfortunately involves uncontrolled approximations , yields critical exponents ( defined by @xmath25 ) of @xmath26 for the ground - state energy and @xmath27 for the singlet - triplet gap .",
    "black and emery @xcite related the critical behavior of the alternating heisenberg chain to the 4-state potts model , and found logarithmic corrections to these power laws , [ theo_e0 ] e_0-e_0 ( ) ^4/3/| | for the ground - state energy per spin , and [ theo_gap ] ( ) ^2/3/| |^1/2 for the gap .",
    "note that at this order the gap scales as the square root of the ground - state energy defect .",
    "more recent theoretical work by affleck _",
    "@xcite has shown that eqs .",
    "( [ theo_e0],[theo_gap ] ) are leading - order predictions of the renormalization group .",
    "the overall constants in these results and implicit in the logarithms are non - universal , and have not yet been determined analytically for this model .",
    "several previous numerical studies have investigated the critical behavior of spin-1/2 alternating heisenberg chains using bulk - limit extrapolations of exact diagonalization results on systems up to about @xmath28 in extent ( see barnes _",
    "_ @xcite and yu and haas @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "we shall see that important systematic errors can arise from extrapolations using these relatively small systems , for example in estimates of critical exponents .",
    "studies of much larger spin-1/2 alternating heisenberg chains have also been published using the dmrg algorithm , although there has been little systematic study of the critical behavior of the simple alternating chain model of eq.(1 ) using dmrg .",
    "the single published reference on this topic is the work of uhrig _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who estimate a gap critical exponent of @xmath29 .",
    "their numerical energies however deviate systematically from this power law at small alternation @xmath3 ( see fig.3 of uhrig _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in",
    "related work , chitra _",
    "@xcite used the dmrg method to study the effects of dimerization and frustration on a generalized alternating chain model with next - nearest - neighbor couplings , and lou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the gap induced by a staggered magnetic field .    in this work",
    "we present a systematic dmrg study of the critical behavior of the original alternating spin-1/2 heisenberg chain of eq.(1 ) , and compare the theoretical predictions eqs.(4,5 ) to numerical results for the ground - state energy per spin and singlet - triplet gap of this model , using systems up to @xmath30 in extent .",
    "for our numerical study we employed the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite , which is a very effective method for studying critical behavior in quasi-1d quantum spin systems .",
    "numerical determination of the critical behavior of the alternating chain , or any similar quantum spin system , is a daunting computational task .",
    "one must accurately determine energy eigenvalues on quite large systems , since characteristic lengths typically diverge at critical points .",
    "an extrapolation through a series of fixed-@xmath19 results is then required on sufficiently large lattices to insure that one is in an asymptotic regime in which finite size effects can be accurately parametrized and eliminated .",
    "the computer memory requirements for diagonalizing these large systems are such that the detailed critical behavior of relatively few quantum spin systems has been explored numerically .",
    "the dmrg algorithm has previously been applied to various interacting fermion systems , including one - dimensional spin chains @xcite , lattice models @xcite , quasilinear molecules @xcite and nuclei @xcite .",
    "the essential concept in dmrg is to `` grow '' a small , finite system into a larger one by the iterative incorporation of new lattice sites . at each such iteration one",
    "retains only the @xmath31 most relevant basis states for spanning the targeted energy eigenstate .",
    "( these basis states are chosen according to a density - matrix weight . )",
    "this selective sampling of hilbert space yields accurate energy eigenvalues on systems which are well beyond the limits of exact diagonalization . for details of the dmrg method",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers of white @xcite and to a series of lectures recently compiled by peschel _",
    "@xcite    our numerical implementation proceeds as follows .",
    "we divide the spin chain into blocks @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the `` system '' and `` environment '' blocks , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are elementary blocks to be added to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "blocks @xmath36 and @xmath33 are linked by periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we take spin dimers ( two lattice sites of spin @xmath37 each ) as our elementary blocks , and use the infinite algorithm to grow the spin chain , while targeting the lowest - lying spin-0 or spin-1 state . in the case of the spin-0 ground state of the alternating heisenberg chain",
    ", we found that subsequent sweeps with the finite algorithm do not lead to much improvement in the results of the infinite algorithm .",
    "in contrast , for the spin-1 state we found that sweeps with the finite algorithm were important for convergence .",
    "our dmrg implementation uses large , sparse matrices , so the sparse matrix package arpack @xcite was employed .",
    "the time consuming matrix - vector multiplications and the arnoldi / lanczos algorithm arpack were parallelized .",
    "the ground - state energy per spin @xmath38 of a spin chain of length @xmath19 and alternation @xmath3 is of special interest for our study of critical behavior ( see eq .",
    "( [ e0intro ] ) ) .",
    "dmrg yields approximate values @xmath39 that typically converge exponentially fast from above as one increases the number @xmath31 of states retained @xcite .",
    "we also observed this behavior in the present study .",
    "we computed @xmath39 numerically using dmrg on chains of length @xmath40 , 48 , 96 , 144 and 192 , and alternation @xmath41 . at each @xmath19 and @xmath3",
    "we increased @xmath31 in steps of 10 starting at @xmath42 until a fit of the form @xmath43 gave sufficiently stable coefficients for our desired accuracy ; this @xmath31 extrapolation yielded our dmrg energy estimate @xmath38 .",
    "we found that the maximum @xmath31 needed for convergence to a given accuracy increases with increasing chain length @xmath19 and decreasing alternation @xmath3 . for our extreme case @xmath30 and @xmath44 ,",
    "adequate convergence was not achieved until @xmath45 , and we retained the maximum of @xmath46 states in this case .",
    "this resulted in a sparse matrix problem of dimension @xmath47 at each dmrg iteration .",
    "finally , we also confirmed recovery of exact @xmath40 alternating chain results on allowing our dmrg code to iterate to the full hilbert space .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] gives our dmrg results for the ground - state energy per spin for different alternations @xmath3 and chain lengths @xmath19 . for the rather large alternations @xmath48 and @xmath49 we confirmed convergence to accurately known energies with increasing basis state number @xmath31 , as well as convergence with increasing chain length @xmath19 .",
    "finite size effects were more pronounced at smaller @xmath3 , as expected since the system is closer to criticality .",
    "we estimate that the energy errors in table  [ tab1 ] are a few units in the last digit , based on the difference between the maximum-@xmath31 dmrg result and the exponential @xmath50 extrapolation which we quote .",

    "however , on comparing this extrapolation with our dmrg results on @xmath85 , 144 and 192 lattices , we noted clear discrepancies as the alternation @xmath3 decreases .",
