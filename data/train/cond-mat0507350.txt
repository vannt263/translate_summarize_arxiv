    "the asymptotics at @xmath34 are @xmath35 additionally , under the assumption that the magnetization does not change direction due to its interaction with vortices , the self - magnetization energy is irrelevant to our calculations . because of this",

    "even if they pop up , they decay into vortex states with vorticity @xmath46 .",
    "to get an idea about when gv states might occur , let us consider the following scenario in which sqf vortex states are trapped in a small region through a sufficiently small - sized magnetic dot so that they can not go to further distances . in order for sqf states to be stable , the system requires more gain in energy , since energy grows due to the repulsion between sqf states when they get closer . for this purpose",
    ", the dot is required to have sufficiently high magnetization .",
    "we then expect the gvs can be stable if the dot s size is small enough and its magnetization is high enough .",
    "these physical arguments are our starting point . in this section ,",
    "we consider a small circular dot @xmath47 , placed upon a sc thin film .",
    "previously , we studied the vortex states in the absence of antivortices and found that at first the @xmath48 state appears , and , with further increase of magnetization , @xmath49,@xmath50 states occur in turn .",
    "in addition , the number of states depends on the magnetization and the dot s size .",
    "we anticipate the same sitution when the dot s size is small enough to make the gv states stable .",
    "contrary to our previous results , we expect @xmath48 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and so on , when only gv states are present .",
    "the first question we ask here is how small does the dot have to be so that the @xmath53 state will be preferred over the @xmath54 state .",
    "the necessary conditions for this case are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we first evaluate this problem analytically , and , in doing so , we disregard the antivortices to simplify the calculations .",
    "they will be discussed at the end of this section . at the @xmath47 limit ,",
    "the effective energy of a gv state @xmath53 reads @xmath57 whereas the energy of @xmath54 state is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the position of @xmath60th antivortex from the dot s center .",
    "this problem can be simplified by using circular symmetry in the system .",
    "if the vortices are considered to be situated on a ring of radius @xmath61 such that nearest vortices are equally distant from each other , the distance between @xmath60th and @xmath62th antivortices can be expressed as @xmath63 .",
    "thereafter , taking the radius of the ring as @xmath64 , the sum in the second term of eq.([nvor ] ) can be replaced by @xmath65 . under this assumption ,",

    "we expect that new rings occur as new vortices come out . in the next section ,",
    "we show that the first ring carries 6 vortices on it .",
    "however this suffices for our analysis , since it is very unlikely to see a gv state with vorticity @xmath67 . as a result",
    ", the effective energy is now a function of @xmath64 .",
    "optimizing the effective energy with respect to @xmath64 , we find its equilibrium value as @xmath68 directly substituting eq.([rv ] ) into eq.([nvor ] ) , we find @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "let us compare eq.([nvorop ] ) with the energy of a system in the presence of a gv with vorticity @xmath44 @xmath72 from eq.([engiant ] ) and eq.([nvorop ] ) , we find @xmath73 the above equation gives the upper limit for the dot s size as a function of magnetization of vorticity . when the dot s size is smaller than the upper limit , at first the @xmath48 state appears .",
    "the @xmath74 state follows next . with a further increase of magnetization",
    ", new gv states appear spontaneously .",
    "this picture is very similar to our previous results , except we have the gv states instead of the sqf states . in order for the @xmath53 state to appear , the necessary conditions are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig : gvs ] , as the vorticity of the gv states increases , the region in which they might appear shrinks .",

    "[ fig : gven ] .",
    "we find that the giant vortices dominate the vortex states when @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , along with the further increase of the dot s size to @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , we begin to see @xmath49 and @xmath50 states .",
    "however , we do not see @xmath86 or other states with a single quantum flux .",
    "the physical reason for this is that the dot is still small enough so that the vortices can find the enough space to decay into sqf states . when the size is increased to 0.4 ( @xmath87 )",

    "the total flux due to the magnetic dot is zero throughout the entire sc film .",
    "the flux due to the dot causes the spontaneous appearance of gv or sqf states with the dot boundaries . by the same token ,",
    "the flux due to the dot outside the dot boundaries might cause spontaneous av states , when the dot s magnetic field penetrates into the the film . since the total flux is zero over the entire sc film , we expect then the number of antivortices with single quantum flux equals the gv states s vorticity . in principle",
    ", the total gv s vorticity might differ from the number of sqf av states in such a way that the net vorticity is positive .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we do not consider this case . however , if stable av vortices do not exist , this scenerio is quite unlikely .",
    "because of circular symmetry , we assume that they are located on a ring of radius @xmath93 .",
    "again , we stress that this assumption is valid only for a few vortices .",
    "it is , however , sufficient to get a qualitative idea about av states . under the assumption that av states are located within the region of @xmath2 ( @xmath94 limit ) , the effective energy of a gv state @xmath53 with n antivortices surrounding it reads    @xmath95    minimizing the above equation with respect to the ring s radius @xmath96",
    ", we find    @xmath97    directly substituting eq.([ra ] ) into eq.([antvor ] ) , we obtain    @xmath98    the gv state @xmath53 is more energetically favorable than the @xmath99 state , when @xmath100 and @xmath101 . using the initial approximation @xmath93 and eq.([ra ] ) , we determine the boundaries of @xmath102 value as @xmath103 next , we compare @xmath104 and @xmath105 for several values of vorticity @xmath44 within the limits of @xmath102 which are given in eq.([range ] ) .",
    "it turns out than the giant vortices are always more favorable than the case in which they appear together with antivortices in @xmath106 limit . at the opposite limit , @xmath107",
    ", it is quite unlikely to have stable states together with antivortices .",
    "since the effective energy goes to @xmath108 when @xmath109 .",
    "the energy difference @xmath110 can be overcome only when @xmath111 .",
    "however , we do not consider that case in this work because of the inaccuracy of london approximation at the small @xmath112 limit .",
    "actually , when eq.([change ] ) is optimized together with antivortices , it manifests instability for vortex states , that is , high vorticity states become more favorable , and no low vorticity states appear .",
    "the reason for this is logarithmic divergence in the @xmath113 function .",
    "as @xmath114 , this function goes logarithmically to infinity , which suggests that in the london approximation , a vortex - antivortex interaction is not taken care of accurately when the distance between the vortex - antivortex pairs is on the order of a few @xmath5 .",
    "for this situation , we believe that the best approach is the nonlinear landau ginzburg equation .",
    "in the second section , we found that , when the dot s size is as large as about @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , only sqf vortex states occur .",
    "we devote this section to the analysis of geometrical patterns formed by sqf states and their phase diagram . in this part",
    ", we focus on two possible cases ; vortices with and without antivortices .",
    "the former case has been previously analyzed for up to three vortices @xcite .",
    "we determined the geometrical configurations of vortices in the ground state . due to symmetry",
    ", the centers of the two vortices are located on a straight line connecting the vortices with the center of the dot at equal distances from the center .",
    "the occurrence of two vortices can be experimentally detected as a violation of circular symmetry of the field . for three vortices ,",
    "the equilibrium configuration is a regular triangle . in this section ,",
    "we consider further cases . due to the circular symmetry",
    ", vortices seem to favor location on a circle such that they are equally distant from nearest neighbors . however , there is another possible case in which a vortex is situated at the dot s center while others are located on a circle as described just above , in the absence of antivortices .    in order for n vortices to appear",
    ", the necessary condition is that @xmath117 and @xmath118 . using this criteria , we can determine in what configurations and order the vortices appear . to this end",
    ", we study only vortices with positive vorticity that are situated under the dot .",
    "the next step is to minimize with respect to the positions of vortices .",
    "we first start with one vortex .",
    "it turns out that it appears at the center of the dot .",
    "@xmath119 is a function of two dimensionless parameters @xmath102 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath119 defines a critical curve that separates regions with or without vortices , as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vphase ] .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath120 for two vortices .",
    "our calculations show that they are located on a straight line connecting the vortices with the center of the dot at equal distances from the center .",
    "the equation @xmath121 gives the second curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : vphase ] , which separates the regions where one vortex and two vortices appear .",
    "that is , the area between the first curve and second curve indicates where one vortex occurs , while the region between the second curve and third curve is for two vortices .",
    "the equilibrium configuration of three vortices is a regular triangle .",
    "a further increase of @xmath102 makes other vortex states more energetically favorable . up",
    "to seven vortices tend to locate on a ring and equally distant from each other .",
    "namely , four vortices form a square , whereas five vortices appear at the corners of a pentagon .",
    "the equilibrium configuration for six vortices is a hexagon .",

    "geometrical patterns of up to seven vortices are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vstates ] . in principle",
    ", there exists an infinite series of such transitions . here , we limit ourselves to seven vortices .",

    "that is , the larger @xmath102 , the more vortices are pushed towards the dot s center .",
    "next , we study sqf states in the presence of av states .",
    "first , we optimize eq.([change ] ) with respect to positions of vortices and antivortices . in our numerical calculation , we start from , @xmath125 and and try larger values of @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig : anti ] , antivortices are aligned with vortices and appear on a ring outside the dot .",
    "next , we compare the effective energies of these states with sqf states without antivortices around them .",
    "the comparison of effective energies with and without av states shows that av states are not energetically favorable .",

    "our results show that vortices form regular geometric patterns , such as a regular triangle , square , pentagon and hexagon .",
    "however , in the case of seven vortices , one vortex occurs at the dots center , while other six sit at the corners of a hexagon .",
    "the phase diagram of sqf vortex states obeys an equation @xmath134 , which suggests that high - vorticity states prefer larger dots .",
    "we also studied the cases together with av states .",
    "however , our calculations did not show any stable vortex states together with antivortices .",
    "this result might seem implausable since one would expect the presence of av states due to the zero flux condition over the entire film .",
    "however , the zero flux condition can also be satisfied by the presence of a supercurrent outside the dot boundaries , which circulates in the opposite direction to the currents created by vortices under the dot .",
    "furthermore , the london approach does not enable us to analyze the vortex and antivortex states when the dot s size is as large as a few @xmath5 , because it fails for distances on the order of coherence length .",
    "this failure is significantly transparant in the presence of av states .",
    "however , positive vorticity states can be studied through the london approach .    in closing , we studied sqf vortex , gv and av states due to a magnetic dot in the london approximation .",
