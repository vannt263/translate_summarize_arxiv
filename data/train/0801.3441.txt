    "single - transverse spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in hadronic processes have a long history @xcite .",
    "recent experimental measurements of ssas in polarized semi - inclusive lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) @xcite , in hadronic collisions @xcite , and in the relevant @xmath0 annihilation process @xcite , have renewed the theoretical interest in ssas and in understanding their roles in hadron structure and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "there are several approaches to understanding ssas within the qcd framework @xcite .",
    "transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions and fragmentation functions , and their relevance for semi - inclusive dis , the drell - yan process , di - hadron production in @xmath0 annihilations , and the single - inclusive hadron production at hadron colliders have been investigated .",
    "two important contributions from these tmd parton distributions and fragmentation functions have been mostly discussed in the last few years : the sivers quark distribution and the collins fragmentation function .",
    "the sivers quark distribution @xcite represents a distribution of unpolarized quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon , through a correlation between the quark s transverse momentum and the nucleon polarization vector .",
    "the existence of the sivers function requires final / initial - state interactions  @xcite , and an interference between different helicity fock states of the nucleon  .",
    "the collins function represents a correlation between the transverse spin of the fragmenting quark and the transverse momentum of the hadron relative to the `` jet axis '' in the fragmentation process . like the sivers function",
    ", it vanishes when integrated over all transverse momentum .",
    "one of the most nontrivial properties associated with the sivers and collins functions are their universality properties .",
    "although they both belong to the so - called  naive - time - reversal - odd \" functions , they do have different universality properties .",
    "for the quark sivers function , because of the initial / final state interaction difference , they differ by signs for the sidis and drell - yan processes  .",
    "this non - universality has also been extended to other processes , such as the dijet - correlation in hadronic reactions , where it was found that both initial and final state interactions contribute to the ssa , and there exists non - trivial relation between this and those in the sidis and drell - yan processes @xcite , and a standard tmd factorization breaks down  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there have been several studies showing that the collins function is universal between different processes , primarily in the sidis and @xmath0 annihilation @xcite . in these discussions , the gauge links in the fragmentation functions",
    "do not play a crucial role to leading to a nonzero collins function though they are important to retain the gauge invariance , whereas it has been well understood that the gauge links in the parton distributions play very important roles to obtain non - zero quark sivers function .    the collins effect in the fragmentation process and its universality has been recently extended to the hadron production in @xmath1 collisions @xcite , where the azimuthal distribution of hadrons inside a high energy jet can probe the collins fragmentation function and the quark transversity distribution @xcite in the single transverse polarized nucleon - nucleon scattering . in this paper",
    ", we will give the detailed derivation of these results , and argue that the universality is in general and model - independent .",
    "we are interested in the hadron production from the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark which inherit transverse spin from the incident nucleon through transverse spin transfer in the hard partonic scattering processes .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , we study the process , @xmath2 where a transversely polarized proton with momentum @xmath3 scatters on another proton with momentum @xmath4 , and produces a jet with momentum @xmath5 ( transverse momentum @xmath6 and rapidity @xmath7 in the lab frame ) .",
    "the three momenta of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 form the so - called reaction plane . inside the produced jet ,",
    "the hadrons are distributed around the jet axes .",
    "a particular hadron @xmath8 will carry certain longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath9 of the jet , and its transverse momentum @xmath10 relative to the jet axis will define an azimuthal angle with the reaction plane : @xmath11 , shown in fig .  1 .",

    "the relative transverse momentum @xmath10 is orthogonal to the jet s momentum @xmath5 : @xmath13 .",

    "the jet s transverse momentum @xmath6 ( in the lab frame ) is the large momentum scale at the same order as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "of course , the full momentum of the fragmenting quark @xmath61 is off - shell in this diagram .",
    "however , its off - shellness is much smaller than @xmath6 . in order to formulate the final state hadron s momentum ,",
    "we introduce a conjugate light - like vector @xmath62 : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "it is convenient to define this momentum in the center of mass frame of the two incident momenta @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in this frame",

    "_ , width=340 ]    -0.4 cm    now , we turn to discuss the ssa in this process .",
    "we need to generate a phase from the scattering amplitudes to have a non - vanishing ssa .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , the dressed quark propagator in this model may contribute to such a phase .",
    "similarly , the vertex correction to the quark - pion vertex can also contribute a phase .",
    "if the phase comes from the above sources , it is easy to argue the universality of the collins function between our process and the sidis/@xmath0 process , because they are the same .",
    "for example , as we show in fig .  3 , the dressed quark propagator associated with the fragmenting quark can contribute to a nonzero phase @xcite , which will contribute the same to the collins function in all these three processes : @xmath0 annihilation , sidis , and hadron production in @xmath1 scattering .",

    "the short bars indicate the pole contributions to the phase needed for a non - vanishing ssa .",
    "the additional two cuts in ( d ) cancel out each other.__,width=377 ]    -0.4 cm    the main issue of the universality discussion concerns the extra gluon exchange contribution between the spectator and hard partonic part @xcite .",
    "for example , in our case , because the hadron is colorless while the quark is colored , the remanet in the fragmentation process will be also colored .",
    "thus the gluon exchanges between the remanet and the other parts of the scattering amplitudes become essential . in fig .  4 , we have shown all these interactions , including the gluon attachments to the incident quarks ( a , c ) , and final state balancing quark ( d ) and the internal gluon propagator ( b ) .",
    "these diagrams are much more complicated than those discussed in @xcite for sidis and @xmath0 processes , where there is only one diagram contribution in both cases .",
    "therefore , the universality argument for the collins function is not straightforward .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the fragmentation function comes from the kinematic region where the exchanged gluon is parallel to the final state hadron @xcite .",
    "otherwise , their contributions will be power suppressed in the limit of @xmath16 or belong to a soft factor . for these collinear gluon interactions",
    ", we can use eikonal approximation and ward identity to sum them together to form the gauge link in the definition of the fragmentation function @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , we notice that the contributing phases of the diagrams in fig .  4",
    "come from the cuts through the internal propagators in the partonic scattering amplitudes . in fig .  4 , we labeled these cut - poles by short bars in the diagrams . from our calculations",
    ", we find that all these poles come from a cut through the exchanged gluon and the fragmenting quark in each diagram , and all other contributions either vanish in the leading order contribution or cancel out each other .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "2(d ) , we show two additional cuts , which contribute however opposite to each other and cancel out completely . to see this cancellation more clearly",
    ", we can write down the momentum integral of the exchange - gluon , @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents the denominators coming from the scattering amplitude . by power counting analysis ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the fragmentation comes from the kinematic region of @xmath18 being parallel to the final state hadron s momentum @xmath86 . from this fact",
    ", we can parameterize @xmath18 in terms of @xmath87 and @xmath62 , and define @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus the integral of momentum @xmath18 becomes @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the transverse momentum relative to the jet momentum @xmath55 . because @xmath18 is parallel to @xmath87",
    ", @xmath92 will be order 1 , whereas @xmath93 will be order of @xmath94 .",
    "when we perform the integrals of @xmath95 , we need to take two poles from the above propagators to obtain a nonzero collins asymmetry .",
    "these poles will form a cut through the fenyman diagram . physically",
    ", these cuts represent the kinematic allowed final state re - scattering in the diagram .    by examining the behaviors of the propagators in the above kinematic region ,",
    "we further notice that the @xmath96channel gluon propagator @xmath97 does not contribute to a pole .",
    "this is because this propagator is far off - shell : @xmath98 .",
    "if we take a pole from this propagator , we have to constrain the momentum of @xmath18 being proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath4 , whose contribution will be power suppressed .",
    "thus , we shall calculate the pole contributions from other propagators . in fig .  4d",
    ", we show three possible cuts which are kinematic allowed for this diagram .",
    "two of them are associated with the propagator @xmath99 .",
    "this propagator involves large momentum @xmath54 , and can be simplified by using the eikonal approximation , @xmath100 the pole contribution from this propagator is proportional to @xmath101 . with this delta function , the integral over @xmath93 vanishes , because the rest poles are in the same half plane of @xmath93 , @xmath102 where we have used the fact that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this means that the two cuts associated with the propagator @xmath99 cancel out each other .",
    "the above result depends on the momentum flow of @xmath18 in this diagram and the time - like process in the fragmentation region requiring that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the only contribution to the nonzero ssa associated with the collins effect comes from the cut going through the fragmenting quark and the exchange - gluon , as we labeled by short bars in this diagram . summarizing the above analysis",
    ", we find that the contribution from this diagram can be written as @xmath107 where we have made the eikonal approximation for the propagators @xmath99 and @xmath97 .",
    "similar analysis can be done for all other diagrams , and we find that their contributions come from the same poles of the fragmenting quark and the exchange - gluon .",
    "therefore , their contributions will have the similar expression as eq .",
    "( [ eikonal ] ) with the same delta functions in the integral : @xmath108 and the propagator @xmath109 .",
    "thus the contributions from all these diagrams can be summed together . in this sum , we notice that the different diagrams have different color - factors , @xmath110\\times { \\rm tr}[t^at^b]=c_f\\times \\frac{n_c^2 - 1}{4n_c^2}+\\frac{1}{n_c^2}\\frac{if_{abc}}{2}{\\rm tr}[t^at^bt^c ] \\ , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm 4(b ) } : & & \\frac{1}{n_c^2}{\\rm tr}[t^at^ct^b]\\times { \\rm tr}[t^at^d]if_{dbc}=-\\frac{1}{n_c^2}\\frac{if_{abc}}{2}{\\rm tr}[t^at^bt^c ] \\ , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm 4(c ) } : & & \\frac{1}{n_c^2}{\\rm tr}[t^at^ct^b]\\times { \\rm tr}[t^at^bt^c ] \\ , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm 4(d ) } : & & \\frac{1}{n_c^2}{\\rm tr}[t^at^ct^b]\\times { \\rm tr}[t^at^ct^b ] \\",

    "the long distance part of the above result can be factorized into the collins fragmentation function calculated from the right panel of fig .  5 .",
    "in this part , because the @xmath116 integral is proportional to @xmath117 , we can combine the two terms in the integral into one expression contained in the collins function .",
    "therefore , the spin - dependent cross section eq .",

    "therefore , by using the ward identity at this particular order , the final results for all the diagrams of fig .  4 will sum up together into a factorized form as shown in fig .  5 , where the cross section is written as the hard partonic cross section for @xmath122 subprocess multiplied by a collins fragmentation function . the exchanged gluon in fig .",

    "the ward identity ensure that when we sum up the diagrams with all possible gluon attachments we shall get the eikonal propagator from the gauge link in the definition of the fragmentation function . the most important point to apply",
    "the ward identity in the above analysis is that the eikonal propagator does not contribute to the phase needed to generate a nonzero ssa .",
    "this is what we have shown for the collins asymmetry in the above calculations , and the reason , as we mentioned above , is due to the momentum flow of the exchanged gluon and the kinematic constraints in the fragmentation process .",
    "we will show in the next section , that for the two - gluon exchange diagrams the eikonal propagators do not contribute to the phase for the nonzero collins ssa in this process .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) if we interchange @xmath162 to @xmath163 . using the same arguments there , the above integral vanishes .",
    "the above three examples are typical diagrams we encounter for the two - gluon exchange contributions for this channel .",
    "all these diagrams can be analyzed by a similar manner , and we will find that the eikonal propagators do not contribute to the phase needed to a nonzero ssa .",
    "because of this fact , all these diagrams can be summed together to form the contributions from the gauge link in the fragmentation function , where the two gluons attach to the gauge link similar to the diagram we have shown in fig .",
    "since there is no contributions from these eikonal propagators , the collins function calculated from these diagrams will be the same as that in @xmath0 and sidis processes , and the universality preserved .",
    "we have also drawn some other diagrams at this order in fig .",
    "6(d , e , f ) , which contribute to a real gluon radiation in addition to the gluon exchange .",
    "the analysis of these diagrams also show that we do not get contribution from the pole of the eikonal propagators .",
    "for example , the contribution from fig .",
    "6(d ) depends on @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the momentum for the radiated gluon .",
    "we have two eikonal propagators in the above equation . however",

    "2 .   the pole contribution from @xmath175 + after taking this pole , we will have the following @xmath93 integral @xmath176 because the pole constrains that @xmath177 and @xmath178 , the poles of the above three factors are all in the lower half plane .",

    "6(e ) will depend on the following integral , @xmath179 because @xmath180 , we only have one possible pole contribution from the eikonal propagator @xmath181 , which vanishes by the same reason as above for diagram fig .",
    "similarly , if the gluon with momentum @xmath18 attaches to the radiated gluon instead of the incident quark line with momentum @xmath3 ( we did not show this diagram in fig .",
    "6 ) , the contribution vanishes by the same reason .",
    "the contribution from fig .",
    "6(f ) depends on the following integral @xmath182 after eikonal approximation .",
    "if we take the pole contribution from the eikonal propagator , the above integral will reduce to @xmath183 again , because @xmath184 , the poles of the above three factors are all in the lower half plane , and the integral over @xmath93 vanishes .",
    "thus , there is no contribution from the pole of the eikonal propagator for this diagram .    in summary , for the gluon radiation diagrams",
    ", there is no contributions from the pole of the eikonal propagators . because of this fact",
    ", we can use ward identity to sum all these diagrams together to form the gauge link contribution from the fragmentation function , similar to the diagram in fig .  5 with an additional gluon radiation .",
    "concluding the analysis of the two - gluon exchange diagrams in fig .",
    "6 , the eikonal propagators do not contribute to the phase needed for the nonzero ssa associated with the collins effect .",
    "therefore , we can apply the ward identity at this order to sum all these diagrams plus other similar ones .",
    "this sum will lead to the gauge link contribution from the fragmentation function definition , and the fragmentation function will be the same as that in @xmath0 and sidis processes .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the collins function in hadron production in single - transverse - spin polarized @xmath1 scattering is the same as that in @xmath0 and sidis processes .",
    "this universality is a general and model - independent observation , and depends on the fact that the eikonal propagators do not contribute to the phase needed for a nonzero ssa .",
    "we have demonstrated this by explicit calculations for one - gluon exchange diagrams which corresponds to one eikonal propagator in the amplitudes , and two - gluon exchange diagrams which correspond to two eikonal propagators .",
    "although our calculations were based on a model , the analysis and arguments are quite general . the results , as we emphasized , depend on the momentum flow and kinematic constraints in the fragmentation process .",
    "this observation is very different from the ssas associated with the parton distributions , where the eikonal propagators from the gauge link in the parton distribution definition play very important role .",
    "it is the pole of these eikonal propagators contribute to the phase needed for a nonzero ssa associated with the naive - time - reversal - odd parton distributions , which also predicts a sign difference for the quark sivers function between the sidis and drell - yan processes .",
    "more complicated results have been found for the ssas in the hadronic dijet - correlation  @xcite , where a normal tmd factorization breaks down @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the eikonal propagators from the initial and final state interactions in dijet - correlation process do contribute poles in the cross section  @xcite .",
    "because of this , the ward identity is not applicable , and the standard tmd factorization breaks down , although a modified factorization may be valid if we modify the definition of the tmd parton distributions to take into account all the initial and final state interaction effects  @xcite . in the fragmentation process , as we discussed in our paper , the eikonal propagators do not contribute to an imaginary part , and the ward identity is applicable .",
    "we have shown this in our explicit calculations including one - gluon and two - gluon exchange contributions .",
    "there has been discussion about the twist - three quark - gluon correlation contribution in the fragmentation function , especially for the collins effects  .",
    "it will be interesting to further understand these contributions following the analysis in this paper , and discuss the universality issues in a more general ground .",
