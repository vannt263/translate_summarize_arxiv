    "formulation and development of rgt was possible due to fundamental psychological research in the field of reflexion , which had been conducted by vladimir lefebvre @xcite .",

    "the elements of boolean algebra represent all possible choices .",
    "the mutual influences are presented in the form of influence matrix .",
    "in general , rgt inference can be presented as a sequence of the following steps @xcite :    \\1 ) formalize choices in terms of elements of boolean algebra of alternatives ;    \\2 ) presentation of a group in the form of a fully connected relationship graph , where solid - line and dashed - line ribs ( edges ) represent alliance and conflict relationships , respectively ;    \\3 ) if relationship graph is decomposable , then it is represented in the form of polynomial : alliance and conflict are denoted by conjunction ( @xmath0 ) and disjunction ( + ) operations ;    \\4 ) diagonal form transformation ( build diagonal form on the basis of the polynomial and fold this diagonal form ) ;    \\5 ) deduct the decision equations ;    \\6 ) input influence values into the decision equations for each subject .",
    "let us call the process of decision making in a group to be a session .",

    "@xcite . the influences , which subjects make on each other , could be considered as a result of a decision making session previous to _ ultimate decision making ( final session)_. we will call the influences , obtained as a result of a previous session(s ) , a _ set - up influences_. the set - up influences are intermediate result of the overall decision making process .",
    "the term set - up influences is related to the influences , which are used during the final session , only .",
    "consequently , the overall decision making process could be segregated into two stages .",
    "let the result of such discussion ( decision making ) be a particular decision regarding the matter under consideration .",
    "we assume the actual decision making regarding the matter ( final session - stage 2 ) is preceded by preliminary session ( stage 1 ) .",
    "stage 1 is about a decision making regarding the influences ( points of view ) , which each subject will support during the final session .",
    "we call such overall decision making process to be a _ two - stage decision making process_. the general schema of a two - stage decision making is presented in fig.[twostage ] .        to illustrate such model we consider a simple example .    _ example 1 .",

    "the goal of this meeting is to make decision about marketing policy for the next half a year .",

    "director has obtained a freedom of choice , since he can choose any alternative : @xmath31 @xmath21 @xmath28 . at the same time , the 1st and the 2nd advisors support moderate strategy ( @xmath8 = @xmath9 = @xmath5 ) .",
    "finally , the 3rd advisor now can choose between points of view @xmath32 ( aggressive of moderate strategy ) and @xmath5 ( moderate strategy ) : @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the point of view of the 1st and the 2nd advisors is strictly determined , while the point of view of 3rd advisor is probabilistic .",

    "now we compare the results of a single session with the ones of the two - stage decision making .",
    "the single session case has been considered above .",
    "if the final decision has to be made after the single session , then the 3rd advisor would be able to choose alternative @xmath32 and realize action @xmath1 .",
    "this option implies that each advisor is responsible for a particular part of the entire company and can take management decisions on his own .",
    "next we consider the decision made after the two - stage decision making .",
    "in such a case , regardless of influence of the 3rd advisor ( subject @xmath10 ) , choice of advisors @xmath8 and @xmath9 is defined by the interval @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is either @xmath8 or @xmath9 variable . thus , if director is inactive ( @xmath49 ) , subjects @xmath8 and @xmath9 can choose either moderate strategy ( @xmath5 ) or make no decision ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the same is true for subject @xmath10 .",
    "if the director makes influence @xmath5 , then all advisors will choose alternative @xmath5 .",
    "the director himself can choose from the interval @xmath43 after the final session .",
    "this means that the director can choose any alternative , containing action @xmath2 .",
    "thus , occasionally the director can realize his initial point of view as moderate strategy .",
    "this example illustrates how using the two - stage decision making it is possible to make one s opponents choose the one s point of view .",
    "meanwhile a person interested in such reflexive control can still sustain the initial point of view .",
    "the obtained results are applicable in both cases when 1 ) only the director makes a decision ; or 2 ) the decision are made individually by each subject .",
    "now we consider the two - stage model in more details . in the considered example , during the preliminary session only the decision regarding the influences has been under consideration . in general case , however , before the final session has begun , there can be made decisions regarding any parameters of the final session .",
    "such parameters include but are not limit to :    \\1 ) group structure ( number of subjects and relationships between subjects in a group ) ;    \\2 ) points of view ;    \\3 ) decision to start a final session ( a time when the final session should start ) , etc .",
    "we call the decision regarding a single parameter to be _ consecutive decision _ , and decisions regarding distinct parameters to be _ parallel decisions_.    therefore , during the first stage ( before the final session ) it is possible to make multiple decisions regarding various parameters of the final session .",
    "this decisions could be both parallel and consecutive ones .",
    "we call such model of decision making to be a _ multi - stage process of decision making _ ( fig.[multistage ] ) .",
    "next we consider realization of multi - stage decision making with rgt .",
    "_ example 2 : change a group structure .",
    "_ considering the subject from example 1 , we analyze the case when director wants to exclude the 3rd advisor from the group , which will make the final decision .",
    "in such a case , there is a single action  1  to exclude subject @xmath10 from the group .",
    "then boolean algebra of alternatives includes only two elements : 1 and 0 .",
    "furthermore , it is enough that director just raise a question to exclude subject @xmath10 from a group and make influence 1 on each subject : if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( table [ decint ] ) .",
    "thus the decision to exclude subject @xmath10 from the group would be made automatically ( fig.[polyn2 ] ) .     from a group.,height=75 ]    _ example 3 : realization of a multi - stage decision making .",
    "_ let the first decision discussed during the first stage is a decision regarding influences ( points of view ) .",
    "the next decision was about exclusion of a subject @xmath10 from the group .",
    "thus , during the first step the formation ( setting - up ) of points of view has been implemented , then the structure of a group was changed .",
    "therefore the group , which should make a final decision is described by polynomial @xmath55 .",
    "the decision equations and their solutions are presented in table [ decint3 ] .",
    "the overall multi - stage decision making process is presented in fig.[multiex ] .        ' '' ''    a&@xmath56&@xmath57 +    ' '' ''    b&@xmath58&@xmath59 +    ' '' ''    c&@xmath60&@xmath61 +    [ decint3 ]        we consider that the point of view can not change without preliminary session regarding the parameter .",
    "therefore we assume that the points of view do not change after the change of group structure .",
    "therefore , during the final session the subjects would make the set - up influences derived from the preliminary session : subjects @xmath8 and @xmath9 will make influences @xmath5 and subject @xmath7 will have a choice from the interval @xmath43 .",
    "such process is introduced in fig .",
    "[ multiex ] . during the 1st stage ( first step ) , the points of view of subjects have been formed . on the 2nd stage ( second step ) , the decision to exclude subject @xmath10 from a group has been made .",
    "finally , during the 3rd stage the final decision regarding the marketing strategy has been made .",
    "this study introduces the two - stage and multi - stage decision making processed . during the last stage",
    "the final decision is made . during the earlier stages",
    "the decisions regarding the parameters of a final session are considered .",
    "this study shows how before the final decision making the intermediate decision regarding parameters of the final session can be made and how to overall process of decision making could be represented as a sequence of decision making sessions .",
    "the important feature of the multi - stage decision making is that during the preliminary sessions subjects can convince other subjects to accept their own point of view .",
    "therefore other subjects can be convince to make decisions beneficial for a particular one .",
    "such approach also allows to distribute the responsibility between all the members of the group , who make the final decision .",
    "the results presented in this study allow to extend the scope of applications of rgt to modeling of multi - stage decision making processes .",
    "therefore it becomes possible to perform scenario analysis of various variants of future trends and apply reflexive control to the management of projects ."
