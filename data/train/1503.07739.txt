    "polymer translocation is a common process in various biological systems @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of these processes is important for novel medical applications and treatments as well as for new dna sequencing technology where the molecule is driven through an artificial channel in a membrane and each nucleotide induces a characteristic currents across the membrane from which it can be identified @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements have also shown that it is possible to separate polymers of different lengths and produce an accurate drug delivery system based on translocation @xcite .",
    "the crossing rate of the polymer can , however , depend strongly on the environment , thereby affecting the measured signal . a better understanding of the translocation dynamics could help make these types of methods more reliable .",
    "a polymer escaping from a metastable external potential well through a narrow channel represents a generic model of such systems .",
    "the channel represents both an energetic as well as an entropic barrier .",
    "the energy barrier can have contributions from steric effects as well as the electromagnetic field of the channel and ions in the surrounding liquid .",
    "the translocation rate of ideal polymers in simple external potentials has been estimated analytically in limits where the chain is either significantly larger or smaller than the external potential well @xcite .",
    "an analogy with semiclassical treatment of quantum tunneling of a particle has been used @xcite .",
    "other types of polymers , such as ring polymers have also been studied @xcite .    for more complex polymers",
    ", numerical simulations can provide an estimate of the escape rate .",
    "but , since polymer escape is typically a rare event on the time scale of atomic vibrations , a direct numerical solution to the equations of motion ( molecular dynamics , md ) becomes impractical .",
    "the timescale difference can amount to many orders of magnitude .",
    "the path integral hyperdynamics ( pihd ) method @xcite makes it possible to accelerate the escape by applying an artificial bias force , thereby reducing the time interval that needs to be simulated , and then subsequently correcting the calculated rate to give an estimate of the true rate .",
    "this methodology has previously been applied to polymer escape from a one - dimensional external potential @xcite .",
    "pihd has been shown to work even for a time dependent bias force @xcite .",
    "we note that this method is different from voter s hyperdynamics method @xcite , where the bias potential is designed to vanish at first order saddle points .",
    "alternatively , an estimate based on statistical mechanics rather than dynamical trajectories started at the initial state can be used to estimate transition rates , if the initial state is assumed to reach and maintain equilibrium distribution of energy in all degrees of freedom .",
    "such a rate theory approach involves much less computational effort than simulation of trajectories .",
    "kramers theory of chemical reactions in solutions @xcite has , for example , been applied to estimate the escape rate of polymers .",
    "it assumes , however , a one - dimensional reaction coordinate and the question is how to define such a coordinate in a system with multiple , coupled degrees of freedom as in a polymer .    in this article",
    ", we present studies of the escape of polymers from a two - dimensional external potential well using standard langevin dynamics , pihd , and kramers rate theory .",
    "two different polymer models are studied : ( 1 ) self - avoiding polymers without bending stiffness , and ( 2 ) ideal polymers without excluded volume .",
    "the polymers are modeled using the finite extension nonlinear elastic ( fene ) model with lennard - jones repulsive interaction .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the following section , the methodology is presented , including a description of the polymer models , the pihd method , langevin dynamics , and the rate theory . in section 3 ,",
    "the results are presented , followed by a discussion in section 4 .",
    "the polymers were modeled as strings of beads coupled with an interaction potential and subject to a two - dimensional external potential .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass of a bead and @xmath2 is the number of beads in the polymer .",
    "the position of bead @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 and the velocity by @xmath5 .",
    "the interaction potential is @xmath6 where the external potential is @xmath7 the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 give the curvature of the well and of the barrier , respectively , @xmath10 the height of the barrier located at @xmath11 and the @xmath12 the cross - over point between the two parabolas .",
    "the external potential is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials](a ) . a potential function with the same @xmath13-dependence but without confinement in the @xmath14-direction",
    "was used in the work of shin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the beads is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eq : ljpotential}\\ ] ] the repulsive interaction between the beads is a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential that is truncated and shifted so that @xmath18 if @xmath19 .",
    "the shift by @xmath20 ensures continuity of the function .",
    "the interaction potential between adjacent beads , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials](b ) , also includes an attractive interaction , the so - called finite extension nonlinear elastic ( fene ) interaction .",
    "non - adjacent beads only repel each other through the @xmath21 potential , the second sum in eq . then including all pairs of beads .",
    "we will refer to this full interaction model as the self - avoiding polymer . for comparison ,",
    "we have also carried out simulations with a simpler model where non - adjacent beads do not interact at all .",
    "the summation over @xmath21 in eq .",
    "then includes only adjacent beads .",
    "we will refer to this simpler model as the ideal polymer.    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results presented here show how increased confinement of the external potential , going from the one - dimensionally to a two - dimensionally confining potential , affects the escape rate of the polymers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates1d2d ] .",
    "the added confinement lowers the number of possible configurations that a self - avoiding chain can take when it is sitting in the minimum , increasing the free energy of the initial state with respect to the transition state .",
    "the curvature of the external potential in the added dimension , the @xmath14-direction , is the same at the barrier and at the initial state minimum , and thus this effect is relatively more important in the initial state since the polymer tends to be elongated at the barrier .",
    "a clear minimum in the escape rate of self - avoiding polymers is obtained for intermediate length , about @xmath22 , and this becomes even more pronounced in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the escape rate of ideal polymers , where repulsive interaction between the non - adjacent beads has been turned off , does not show such a minimum for the range studied here .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that the crowding of the beads in the self - avoiding polymers in the initial state well is responsible for lowering the free energy barrier for escape . in the case of ideal polymers ,",
    "such crowding effects are largely absent since only adjacent beads are subject to a repulsive interaction .",
    "qualitatively correct trends are obtained by applying kramers rate theory to a one - dimensional reaction coordinate defined as the @xmath13-component of the centroid coordinate .",
    "however , the escape rate is overestimated for the longer polymers .",
    "for the ideal polymers , kramers rate theory gives closer agreement with the pihd simulations .",
    "this overestimate of the rate for the self - avoiding polymers can also be somewhat reduced by defining the effective potential curve as a thermal average of the external potential only , @xmath23 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] .",
    "this has almost no effect on the rate estimated for the ideal polymers , but significantly reduces that of the longer self - avoiding polymers , essentially through cancellation of errors .",
    "the results presented here illustrate that a centroid coordinate can not give a good reaction coordinate for the longer polymers , as also concluded by debnath and coworkers @xcite .",
    "a similar problem in defining a one dimensional reaction coordinate has been discussed in the context of the polymer reversal problem @xcite . a good reaction coordinate needs to include information about the shape as well as the location of the polymer at the transition state .",
    "this result is similar to what has been concluded in quantum mechanical rate theory where feynman path integrals are used to represent quantum delocalization . here , more beads need to be introduced in the path integrals the lower the temperature becomes , so an analogy exists between reduced temperature in the tunneling problems and length of polymers in the classical polymer escape problems .",
    "calculations of tunneling rates using the centroid as reaction coordinate have , indeed , shown an unphysical increase in tunneling rate as temperature is lowered , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and a good quantum transition state needs to be defined in terms of both location and shape of the feynman paths @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "a linear combination of the centroid coordinate and radius of gyration could be used as a good reaction coordinate , but the proper combination of the two will depend on the length of the polymer .",
    "a systematic optimization of the location and orientation of a hyper - planar dividing surface so as to maximize the transition state free energy could possibly be used for the polymer escape problem , analogous to what has been done for diffusion problems @xcite , it may also turn out that a hyper - planar dividing surface does not provide sufficient flexibility to confine the longer polymers to the bottleneck region for the escape .",
    "this will be studied in future work .",
