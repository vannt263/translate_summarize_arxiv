    "4u1608 - 52 is a transient low - mass x - ray binary with outbursts which recur on timescales of 80 days to two years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was classified to be an atoll source based on the correlated x - ray spectral variability and high - frequency - noise ( hfn ) in the x - ray intensity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "4u 1608 - 52 has been observed a few times with an energy spectrum consistent with a power - law at x - ray luminosities below @xmath0ergs / s ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray monitoring of 4u1608 - 52 with rxte / asm indicated an outburst in early 1996 . in response to a high state detection of 4u1608 - 52 in rxte / pca scans ( @xcite ) , pointed observations with the rxte / pca",
    "were conducted during the decay phase of this outburst on march 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and on march 15 , 18 , and 22 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "kilo - hertz qpos were discovered in 4u 1608 - 52 in march 3 , 6 , and 9 observations .",
    "no x - ray bursts were observed with rxte / pca in early march 1996 ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we report the timing analysis results on rxte / pca observations of 4u 1608 - 52 on march 15 , 18 , and 22 .",
    "x - ray monitoring by rxte / asm shows that our observations on march 15 , 18 and 22 were taken near the end of the outburst decay , with asm daily - averaged brightness of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mcrab respectively ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the persistent x - ray flux ( 2 - 20 kev ) obtained with the rxte / pca was in the range between @xmath4erg / s/@xmath5 and @xmath6erg / s/@xmath5 .",
    "the source count rate in the energy range 1 - 60 kev varied between 190 and 450 cps .",
    "three x - ray bursts were observed in one orbit on march 22 .",
    "they show the evidence of a high energy excess above a planckian spectrum , but no kilo - hertz qpo were detected in the bursts ( yu et al .",
    "1997 , in preparation ) .",
    "we thus exclude 50 seconds data of each burst when estimating the properties of the kilo - hertz features in the persistent emission .",
    "the pca / rxte provides several data modes which were used in the analysis reported in this paper .",
    "the color - color diagrams were constructed from the _ standard 2 mode _ data , which provides 129 energy channels and 16 second time resolution .",
    "we made use of the _ event mode _ data ( 64 energy channels and 122 @xmath7s time resolution ) to generate the power density spectra ( pds ) from 0.001 hz to 100 hz .",
    "background count rates as a function of time were produced with the standard background model supplied by the rxte guest observer facility ( @xcite ) .",
    "after subtracting the background in 3 bands ( approximately 2.2 - 5.1 , 5.1 - 10.1 , and 10.1 - 29.8 kev ) , light curves and color - color diagrams for 4u1608 - 52 were generated .",
    "fig.2 is the color - color diagram of 4u 1608 - 52 plotted with the data obtained on march 15 , 18 , and 22 , as triangles , squares , and circles , respectively .",
    "each data point represents 240s of observation .",
    "the data for about 2000s , starting from the rise of the first burst to the end of that orbit , were excluded .",
    "the uncertainty in the hardness ratios were also estimated for a hypothetical exosat observation , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "we have obtained rebinned pds in the frequency range of @xmath8 hz from background - subtracted light curve of the _ event mode _ data .",
    "the average pds of individual days on march 15 , 18 and 22 are shown in fig .",
    "the average level of the white noise caused by counting statistics was subtracted in these spectra .",
    "these pds show similar hfn components with a flat top from 0.01 hz to about 10 hz .",
    "the low frequency noise ( lfn ) can be represented by a power - law and the hfn components can be described as a power - law with an exponential cutoff for atoll sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model basically agrees with our data as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the fractional _ rms _ of the hfn for each day is @xmath9% , @xmath10% , and @xmath11% , respectively .",
    "the correponding hfn cut - off frequencies are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 hz .",
    "all the above errors represent a 90% confidence level ( @xcite ) .    in the pds of the first orbit on march 15 ,",
    "a qpo peak at 20 hz can be seen .",
    "a broad excess of power at 10 - 30 hz is also visible in the second and third orbits on march 15 .",
    "further analysis of the _ single - bit mode _ data and the _ event mode _ data in each orbit at higher frequencies revealed qpo features in the frequency range of 567 - 800 hz in the average pds .",
    "an example of the leahy - normalised pds obtained from the _ event mode _ data in 1 - 30 kev in the 3rd orbit on march 15 is shown in fig .",
    "4 . there is broad excess of power between a few tens hz to about 200 hz in each of the pds on march 15 and 22 .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "all errors in the table correspond to unreduced @xmath15 .",
    "we estimate the _ rms _ amplitudes of the kilo - hertz qpo peaks by fitting pds at 200 - 2000 hz range with a linear component plus a lorentzian peak .",
    "the _ rms _ amplitudes of the qpo peaks were obtained from the lorentzian component .",
    "we then divided the 2 - 60 kev energy range into 7 bands ( 2.2 - 3.5 kev , 3.5 - 5.4 kev , 5.4 - 7.9 kev , 7.9 - 11.1 kev , 11.1 - 14.6 kev , 14.6 - 20.4 kev and above 20.4 kev ) and studied the pds in these bands using the _ event mode _ data .",
    "the qpo peaks were usually not clearly visible in the average pds in each of the 7 bands .",
    "the individual pds in the frequency range between 200 hz and 2000 hz were fit with a model composed of a linear component plus a box function .",
    "the box functions were centered at the peak frequencies and widths were set to be 2 times of the qpo fwhms ( see table 1 ) .",
    "then we calculated the _",
    "rms _ amplitude from the box function integrals .",
    "finally we averaged the _",
    "rms _ amplitudes from each energy - dependent pds over the six orbits . a positive correlation between the average qpo _ rms _ amplitude and the photon energy",
    "was observed , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "we also notice that there is no apparent correlation between the qpo _ rms _ and the intensity .",
    "but the qpo centroid frequencies and the average source intensities show the tendency of a positive correlation within a few hours ( see fig.6 ) . for example , on march 15 , the higher the count rates , the higher the qpo frequencies were . on march 22 ,",
    "a similar trend was also observed .",
    "kilo - hertz qpos in x - ray flux have been observed from about twelve lmxbs so far ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) . nine of them are atoll sources or probable atoll sources . in our observation of 4u 1608 - 52 ,",
    "its persistent flux in the 2 - 20 kev band ranged between @xmath16 , corresponding to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath17 assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity was at or below the lowest luminosity of 4u  1608 - 52 in its island state ever observed with exosat and ginga ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we detected no large motion in the pca color - color diagram within a day . also , the power density spectra were dominated by hfn with _ rms _ around 13% .",
    "this suggests that 4u 1608 - 52 was in its island state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is the second atoll source observed to exhibit kilo - hertz qpo in both the banana and the island state ( the first is 4u  1636 - 53 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the increase in qpo _ rms _ amplitude with photon energy in our observations shows that the qpo emission is harder than the average spectrum . a positive correlation between _ rms _",
    "amplitude and photon energy in the range from 2 kev to more than 11 kev has also been observed from kilo - hertz qpos in other sources ( for example , ford et al .",
    "1997b and zhang , w. et al .",
    "this suggests that all these qpos are of similar origin .",
    "our qpo observations can be compared to the observations of 4u 1608 - 52 made in early march ( berger et al .",
    ". in all observations only a single qpo with centriod frequency above 200 hz has been detected and the qpo _ rms _ amplitude increases with photon energy .",
    "the _ rms _ amplitude versus energy curve for march 15 and 22 is consistent with that presented for march 3 ( berger et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , on march 3 and 6 , the qpo was with a fwhm of 515  hz in the pds averaged over 100 seconds ; while on march 9 , 15 , and 22 , the qpo can not be tracked as the qpo observed on march 3 and 6 , and was with a fwhm of 80140  hz , which are derived from the average pds over a few thousand seconds . on march 3 , the x - ray intensity was high and the qpo frequency varied in the range 830 - 890  hz with no correlation with x - ray intensity ( @xcite ) . comparing individual orbits on march 15 and 22 , when",
    "the x - ray intensity is lower , the qpo frequency is lower ( 570800 hz ) and appears to be positively correlated with x - ray intensity .",
    "this correlation does not hold when data from different days are compared",
    ". a similar trend of correlation over one day time scales and lack of correlation on longer timescales has been observed for qpo frequency versus x - ray intensity in other x - ray burster sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the correlation of qpo frequency with the flux of a blackbody component of the x - ray spectrum was found to be robust over several months in 4u  0614 + 091 ( @xcite ) .",
    "kaaret et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have interpreted the lack of correlation between qpo frequency and x - ray intensity of 4u  1608 - 52 on march 3 as reported in berger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as evidence that the accretion disk is terminated near the marginally stable orbit when the source is at high x - ray intensities and high mass accretion rates .",
    "the march 15 and 22 observations presented here suggest that the qpo frequency may be correlated with x - ray intensity , at least over one day time scales , when 4u  1608 - 52 is at low x - ray intensities .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of kaaret et al .",
    "( 1997 ) since , when the mass accretion rate is low , the disk should be disrupted by the neutron star magnetosphere or radiation forces outside the marginally stable orbit and the qpo frequency should then be correlated with mass accretion rate ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; miller et al .",
    "it is important that additional observations of 4u  1608 - 52 be obtained over a wide range of x - ray intensities .",
    "it is also possible that the qpos observed on march 15 and 22 may correspond to a pair of qpos , but only one of the two is detectable in the individual orbit ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "this would imply that the frequency separation is larger than 233@xmath1822 hz ( fig.6 ) .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the neutron spin frequency is larger than 233 hz , within the framework of the beat frequency model discussed above .",
    "if we interpret the 20 hz qpo observed on march 15 as due to the lense - thirring precession in the model of stella and vietri ( 1997 ) , the inferred neutron star spin frequency for 4u  1608 - 52 is between 300 hz and 365 hz , depending on the tilt angle off the equatorial plane .",
    "however , future simultaneous detection of all three qpos ( the lense - thirring precession frequency , the beat frequency and the kerplerian frequency , as of 20 hz , 435 - 500 hz and 800 hz respectively in the case of march 15 observation ) in 4u1608 - 52 or a detection of qpo in the x - ray bursts from 4u  1608 - 52 is needed to confirm the above inference .",
    "we appreciate the assistance of rxte / gof in data reduction and analysis and dr .",
    "s. dieters of uah for help with the rxte data analysis software and various suggestions .",
