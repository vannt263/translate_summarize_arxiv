    "let us recapitulate the rationale so far : it was shown in ref  @xcite that if we accept the structure of quantum measurements , we can identify quantum probabilities as the most general non - contextual probability assignments .",
    "whereas this approach only considers a single measurement / event  or at most measurements of separate quantum systems  in the quantum process approach outlined above we derive a general rule to assign joint probabilities to an arbitrary number of events .",
    "the ordinary born rule is thus recovered from the general one in the case where a single region is considered  in which case instruments reduce to povms and process matrices reduce to density matrices  @xcite .",
    "we are in particular interested in the situation where two consecutive measurements are performed on a single quantum system .",
    "ordinary gleason - type derivations of quantum probabilities do not tell us how to assign joint probabilities to two such events : one must introduce an additional ingredient  the state update rule .",
    "if the statistics for the first measurement are described by a density matrix @xmath14 , and the first measurement is described by a cp map @xmath95 , one calculates the probabilities for the second measurement , given the outcome of the first is known , by applying the born rule to the updated state  @xcite @xmath96 ( note that the update rule does not depend on the particular decomposition of @xmath95 into kraus operators @xmath97 . ) in an operational perspective , rule is seen as a quantum analogue of classical knowledge update . within the quantum process framework , this is more than an analogy : the update rule is _ derived _ from the joint probability assignment .    to make the argument rigorous",
    ", we should remark again that the quantum frame function _ is not _ a normalised probability measure over the entire space of potential events .",
    "formally , the frame function defines a conditional probability for observing a cp map @xmath3 given an instrument @xmath98 : @xmath99 p(\\mathcal{m}^a|\\mathfrak{i}^a )   & = f(\\mathcal{m}^a ) \\quad & \\textrm{if } \\mathcal{m}^a\\in\\mathfrak{i}^a \\\\ & = 0 \\quad & \\textrm{otherwise . } \\end{matrix * } \\label{frametoprob}\\ ] ] ( with a similar definition for multiple regions @xmath19 , @xmath100 ) even though the conditioning on the instruments is necessary to define as a classical probability , we will omit it in the following out of notational convenience .",
    "expression defines an ordinary , classical probability measure , which lets us use all the machinery of classical probability theory . in particular , the conditional probability to observe @xmath39 in region @xmath40 , given that @xmath3 is observed in region @xmath19 , can be calculated from the joint probability distribution : @xmath101}{\\sum_{m^b\\in \\mathfrak{i}^b}\\operatorname{tr}\\left [ \\left(m^a\\otimes m^b\\right)\\cdot w\\right ] } \\\\",
    "= & \\operatorname{tr}m^b \\widetilde{w}_{m^a } , \\label{bayes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the _ updated process matrix _",
    "@xmath102}{\\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\left(m^a\\otimes \\sum_{m^b\\in \\mathfrak{i}^b } m^b\\right)\\cdot w\\right]}. \\label{updatew}\\ ] ]    relevant to the ordinary state update rule is the case where @xmath19 precedes temporally @xmath40 , and the evolution between the two events is trivial .",
    "this scenario is described by the process matrix ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath103}^{a_ob_i}\\otimes { \\mathds{1}}^{b_o},\\\\ { [ [ { \\mathds{1}}]]}^{a_ob_i}:= & \\sum_{jl}{\\left|j\\middle\\rangle\\middle\\langlel\\right|}^{a_o}\\otimes { \\left|j\\middle\\rangle\\middle\\langlel\\right|}^{b_i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the density matrix describing the input state of region @xmath19 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that , in this case , the updated process matrix reduces to @xmath104^{b_i}\\!\\otimes { \\mathds{1}}^{b_o } \\equiv \\widetilde{\\rho}_{\\mathcal{m}^a}\\otimes { \\mathds{1}}^{b_o},\\ ] ] which is the process - matrix description of region @xmath40 receiving a state described by the density matrix @xmath105 .",
    "in this work we have shown that it is possible to use a gleason - type approach to derive a quantum probability rule that subsumes both the born rule and the state update rule . by using the structure of local quantum operations and a reasonable non - contextuality assumption",
    "we have derived both the new rule and the appropriate object to represent the arbitrary background structure , or process .",
    "our demonstration that the state update , or `` collapse '' rule can be regarded as non - fundamental offers a new perspective on a variety of foundational questions . in particular , informational interpretations of wavefunction collapse can now be given a rigorous foundation : state - update can be viewed as a case of classical probabilistic conditioning .",
    "a further advantage of the approach presented here is that it does not presuppose any a - priori distinction between space - like and time - like separated events . as such",
    ", it avoids conceptual difficulties associated with the non - covariant nature of the state update rule .",
    "it is thus a promising direction to develop a fully relativistic version of the formalism that encodes space - time symmetries .",

    "<S> let us briefly consider how this approach works . following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , events are identified with _ quantum _ effects , that represent the result of a measurement on a quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> formally , for a @xmath4-level quantum system , the full set of quantum effects is defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the space of linear operators on a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> contexts are described by positive - operator - valued measures ( povms ) . </S>",
    "<S> a povm is a complete set @xmath8 of effect operators that sum up to the identity , @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming measurement non - contextuality here means that the probability of a particular quantum effect is assumed to be independent of the context ( povm ) to which it belongs . </S>",
    "<S> operationally , this means that the probability assigned to a given event does nt depend on any extra information regarding how it was achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> a frame function for quantum effects is defined as a mapping from the set of all effects to the unit interval : @xmath10,\\ ] ] satisfying @xmath11 @xmath12    using this definition , the task then is to prove that for each frame function , @xmath13 , there is a unit - trace positive operator @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .    the proof in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite follows three simple steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , one proves linearity of the frame - function over the field of nonnegative rational numbers , then extension to full linearity is obtained by proving continuity of the frame - function . </S>",
    "<S> then , as the frame - function has been proved to be linear , it can be recast as arising from an inner product . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , using the hilbert - schmidt inner product on the operator space @xmath16 , the frame - function can be written as @xmath15 for some positive semidefinite , unit - trace operator @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this both characterises the born rule and also defines the density operator as the appropriate object to represent the quantum state .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have noted , the above proof does not tell us how to assign probabilities to consecutive events . </S>",
    "<S> that is , assuming we know the state of a quantum system prior to measurement , the born rule alone does not tell us how to update this state following measurement . to remedy this situation , we now wish to provide a similar proof for a probability rule that can subsume _ both _ the born rule and the state - update rule .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider more general operational primitives than those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and instead consider local regions where one can perform actions that are associated with outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> the class of allowed local actions is broad : one can perform measurements , realise transformations , or even add and discard ancillary systems . </S>",
    "<S> such actions can also be associated with local outcomes and we define a particular single case outcome , associated to a given action , as the relevant _ event_. the event thus now labels not only the outcome but also any concurrent transformation to the local system .    just as with effects in the traditional approaches , we assume a minimal operational labelling for transformations : different interactions of the system with an environment , that can not be distinguished by looking at the system alone , will be assigned the same label .    </S>",
    "<S> if we consider a particular run of an experiment there will in general be a collection of such events that occur , one for each local region . </S>",
    "<S> one can associate a joint probability to this set of events , and , given enough runs of an experiment , one can empirically verify probability assignments for each possible permutation of events .     </S>",

    "<S> an event is represented by a completely - positive map @xmath3 . ]    formally , an event in region @xmath19 is represented by a _ completely positive trace - non - increasing _ </S>",
    "<S> ( cp ) map @xmath20 , where input and output spaces are the spaces of linear operators over input and output hilbert spaces of the local region , @xmath21 , @xmath22 respectively ( here identified with the corresponding matrix spaces )  @xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ region ] . </S>",
    "<S> we write @xmath23 for the set of linear maps from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the set of cp maps associated to each region , @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> we demand _ complete _ positivity because operationally it should be possible to perform arbitrary quantum operations in the local region . </S>",
    "<S> this includes performing operations on a subsystem that is part of a larger system . </S>",
    "<S> complete positivity means that , for arbitrary dimensions of an ancillary system @xmath27 , the map @xmath28 transforms positive operators into positive operators , where @xmath29 is the identity map on @xmath30 . </S>",

    "<S> a cp map can be decomposed as @xmath32 , where the kraus operators @xmath33 satisfy @xmath34 for a trace non - increasing map  @xcite    the context for each set of cp maps is now no longer a povm but rather a _ </S>",
    "<S> quantum instrument_. an instrument thus represents the collection of all possible events that can be observed given a specific choice of local action . </S>",
    "<S> given a local region @xmath19 , an instrument is formally defined as a set @xmath35 of cp maps that sum up to a completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) map :    @xmath36     in region @xmath19 corresponds to a shared outcome of two different instruments , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; @xmath39 in region @xmath40 to a shared outcome of instruments @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> instrument non - contextuality implies the joint probability @xmath43 for the two events is independent of whether instrument @xmath37 or @xmath38 was used in region a , and whether instrument @xmath41 or @xmath42 was used in region b. ]    we are now in a position to define the relevant frame - function and derive the appropriate probability rule for this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> just as the born rule tells us how to calculate the probability of a particular outcome given the relevant measurement operator , the quantum process rule should tell us how to assign a joint probability to each possible collection of local events given the relevant instruments . </S>",
    "<S> we assume `` instrument '' non - contextuality , rather than `` measurement '' non - contextuality . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the joint probability for a set of events , one for each region , is independent of the particular context ( set of instruments ) to which they belong , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ noncontextuality ] .    </S>",
    "<S> as for ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the non - contextuality assumption is formalised by requiring that probabilities are given by a frame - function . </S>",
    "<S> each `` frame '' is now a collection of instruments , one per region , rather than a single povm .    </S>",
    "<S> [ pframefn ] a frame - function , f , for a set of local regions x= a , b , c .... , is defined by :    1 .   </S>",

    "<S> f is normalised for all sets of cp maps , @xmath45 , that form instruments @xmath46 , + @xmath47    we now show that this definition is sufficient to derive the new probability rule . as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we first prove linearity of the frame - function .    </S>",
    "<S> [ wlinear ] the frame - function f is a convex - multilinear functional on @xmath48    where by convex - multilinear we mean : @xmath49\\\\ & = pf\\big[\\mathcal{m}_1^a , \\mathcal{m}^b , \\mathcal{m}^c , \\dots \\big ] + ( 1-p ) f\\big[\\mathcal{m}_2^a , \\mathcal{m}^b , \\mathcal{m}^c , \\dots \\big]\\\\ &   ( 0\\leq p \\leq 1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for all other regions @xmath50    we fix instruments at all regions , except for region @xmath19 , to be instruments with a single cptp map each : @xmath51    consider two instruments applied in region @xmath19 : @xmath52 the frame function constraints imply : @xmath53   + f\\left[\\mathcal{m}^a_2 , ~{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-2.5mu\\mathcal{m}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}^b , .. \\right]+f\\left[\\mathcal{m}^a_3 , ~{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-2.5mu\\mathcal{m}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}^b, .. \\right ] & = 1\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\ </S>",

    "<S> applying additivity twice    @xmath58    thus @xmath13 is linear in the nonnegative rationals .    </S>",
    "<S> linearity of the frame function on the real numbers can be established using the ` squeeze theorem ' of elementary calculus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> define two sequences of positive rationals , @xmath59 increasing and @xmath60 decreasing , that converge to the same real number @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> then , for any cp map @xmath3 , the map @xmath62 is also cp . </S>",
    "<S> thus , fixing all maps in other regions to be cptp , we have @xmath63 similarly , we have that @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies @xmath65 because @xmath66 and @xmath67 both converge to @xmath68 , eq .   </S>",
    "<S> implies @xmath69 by the ` squeeze theorem ' .    </S>",
    "<S> we have thus proved that @xmath13 is linear on @xmath70 and , with similar steps , linearity can be proven for @xmath71 which concludes the proof .    </S>",
    "<S> just as in ordinary quantum mechanics a _ state _ is defined as a linear functional over effects ( povm elements ) , we can define a multilinear functional over sets of events ( cp maps ) as a _ process _ </S>",
    "<S> , in accordance with the terminology of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we next use the fact that a linear functional can be expressed by means of an inner product . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to derive a new probability rule using our frame function , and also gives the appropriate form for the matrix representation of a process .    </S>",
    "<S> first consider that because each @xmath72 contains a basis of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the frame function @xmath13 can be extended by linearity to the entire linear space @xmath75 ( as opposed to just the set of cp maps ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , it is easy to show that the natural inner product between any two linear maps @xmath3 , @xmath76 @xmath77 is defined as follows ( see methods for details ) : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a hilbert - schmidt basis for the @xmath4-dimensional input space : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also represent this inner product in a more convenient ( and familiar ) form by representing the cp maps associated to each region as choi - jamiolkowski ( cj ) matrices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recall , a cp map associated to a region @xmath19 , where input and output spaces are the spaces of linear operators over input and output hilbert spaces , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , respectively , can be represented as a matrix : @xmath83^t ,   \\label{inversecj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath85 and @xmath86 denotes transposition in that basis . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the methods that the inner product can be expressed as @xmath87 and it is independent of the choice of hilbert - schmidt basis .    </S>",
    "<S> this inner product defines an isomorphism between elements of @xmath75 and linear functionals on the same space . </S>",

    "<S> is also required under the assumption that local operations can act on additional multipartite quantum states shared among the regions @xcite . </S>",
