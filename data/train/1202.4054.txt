    "the result of the measurements on spatially separated maximal entangled state runs counter to local realism , which was named as quantum nonlocality .",
    "quantum nonlocality was the focus of the query of quantum mechanics ( qm ) in the original time when qm was born@xcite .",
    "after bell@xcite gave the first inequality in his theory which classical correlation must obey but qm does nt , quantum nonlocality could be directly perceived through the violation of the corresponding bell - type inequality@xcite .",
    "tsirelson@xcite s study shows that quantum correlations are limited by @xmath0 under the clauser - horne - shimony - holt@xcite ( chsh ) expression of bell s theory .",
    "popescu and rohrlich@xcite ( pr ) presented an unnatural correlation which violates chsh inequality by its algebraic maximum 4 .",
    "all these results illustrate that the set of quantum correlations is bigger than the set of local correlations bounded by bell - type inequalities , but it is still included in a bigger set of the general nonsignaling correlations , which can reach the algebraic maximal violation of bell - type inequalities@xcite .    as an information - theoretic resource ,",
    "the general nonsignaling models in the form of nonsignaling boxes were presented for convenient study of the set of different correlations@xcite .",
    "the nonsignaling boxes not only can give simulations of quantum nonlocal correlations ( qnc ) but also can indicate the correlations beyond qnc  postquantum correlations ( pqc ) , as pr correlations for example .",
    "some extraordinary information processing abilities are revealed by the study of postquantum theories .",
    "the pqc can make communication complexity trivial@xcite , simulate quantum entanglement without communication@xcite , and make dynamics rich in the process of nonlocality swapping@xcite .",
    "nonlocal computation is allowed by the pqc@xcite , and information causality is also violated@xcite .",
    "generally , the stronger nonlocality the resources have , the more useful they are .",
    "the question on how to obtain more nonlocality from weak ones is naturally raised to us . foster et.al@xcite gave an affirmative answer to this question by presenting a deterministic nonlocality distillation protocol ( fww ) for bipartite binary - input and binary - output correlated nonlocal boxes .",
    "then brunner et.al@xcite made an improved protocol ( bs ) where one box s outputs are added into another box s inputs . if these two boxes are identical , this kind of wiring can be regarded as an kind feedback in this sense .",
    "later allcock _ _ et al__@xcite gave a more efficient distillation protocol ( ablpsv ) by changing the nonlocal elements , and hyer et.al@xcite made a depth-3 method ( hr ) by using three boxes in each distillation round .",
    "all these protocols are working fine for the bipartite correlated nonlocal boxes in certain scope .",
    "recently , the distillation protocol for multipartite nonlocality was discussed , where li - yi hsu and keng - shuowu@xcite generalized the bipartite fww protocol into the @xmath1-partite case .",
    "brunner et.al@xcite discussed the bound nonlocality and activation of distillabe nonlocality under the elitzur - popescu - rohrlich@xcite decomposition .",
    "forster@xcite gave a way to bound the distillable nonlocality of a resource by solving a related optimization problem .",
    "binary - outputs of boxes means that the boxes is two dimensional ones , and so far , all the above - mentioned distillation protocols only work for the two dimensional boxes . here",
    "we will present a novel nonlocality distillation protocol for higher dimensional boxes . in our protocol , the boxes to be distilled is replaced by arbitrary high - dimensional boxes and new wiring method is applied on it .",
    "the results show that our protocol distills different boxes with different efficiencies , and the protocol also works for the more general noisy correlated nonlocal boxes .",
    "qm is nonlocal and the nonsignaling models can give simulations of the nonlocal correlations from the respective measurements on spatially separated quantum states . as shown in fig.[hdbox ] , a nonsignaling model is a black box which has two input terminals and two output terminals on the two sides belonging to two spatially separated users - alice and bob . the inputs @xmath2 and @xmath3 simulate alice and bob s possible measurements in quantum measuring process , and the outputs @xmath4 and @xmath5 simulate the possible outcomes after alice and bob s measurements",
