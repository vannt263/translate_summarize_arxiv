    "considerable progress has been made during the past decades in calculating these single particle quantities from first principles , based on non - relativistic brueckner theory @xcite and relativistic many - body theory @xcite . despite the widely different mechanisms which build up the nuclear mean field in these two theoretical approaches , the depth of the single particle potential comes out at approximately the same value when both calculations are restricted to first order in the renormalized in - medium nn - interaction ( g - matrix ) .",
    "other properties , such as the momentum dependence of the nuclear mean field are also qualitatively similar in those two approaches .    in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we have used chiral perturbation theory for a systematic treatment of the nuclear matter many - body problem . in this calculation the contributions to the energy per particle , @xmath10 , originate exclusively from one- and two - pion exchange between nucleons and they are ordered in powers of the fermi momentum @xmath11 ( modulo functions of @xmath12 with @xmath13 denoting the pion mass ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that the empirical saturation point and the nuclear matter compressibility @xmath14mev can be well reproduced at order @xmath15 in the chiral expansion with just one single momentum cut - off scale of @xmath16gev which parametrizes all necessary short range dynamics .",
    "most surprisingly , the prediction for the asymmetry energy , @xmath17mev , is in very good agreement with its empirical value .",
    "furthermore , as a nontrivial fact pure neutron matter is predicted to be unbound and the corresponding equation of state agrees roughly with that of sophisticated many body calculations for low neutron densities @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "given the fact that the bulk properties of nuclear matter can be well described by chiral pion - nucleon dynamics treated up to three loop order it is natural to consider in a next step quantities which characterize in more detail the behavior of a single nucleon moving in the dense nuclear matter environment .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to calculate , using the same framework as in ref.@xcite , the momentum and density dependent ( complex - valued ) single particle potential of nucleons in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we will present here analytical expressions for both the real part @xmath20 and the imaginary part @xmath3 of the nuclear mean field generated by chiral one- and two - pion exchange .",

    "the associated curvature coefficient @xmath30 grows with density approximately as @xmath31 .    as a combined conclusion of ref.@xcite and this work one can thus state that perturbative chiral pion nucleon dynamics gives realistic nuclear binding and saturation as well as realistic ( in - medium ) single particle properties",
