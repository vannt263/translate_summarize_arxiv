    "discovery of superconductivity in a hydrated sodium cobaltate na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o @xcite has attracted much attention recently .",
    "this material is of special interest since it is a @xmath8-electron system having a quasi - two - dimensional lattice structure , which resembles the high @xmath7 cuprates . on the other hand ,",
    "it differs from the cuprates in that the co ions form a triangular lattice , and also there are several bands intersecting the fermi level , all of which are away from half - filling .",
    "another interesting point concerning this material is that some experiments suggest possible occurrence of an unconventional superconductivity.@xcite in particular , there has been a debate as to whether the pairing occurs in the spin singlet channel or in the triplet channel .",
    "an unchanged knight shift across @xmath7 found in some experiments suggests spin - triplet pairing,@xcite while the knight shift does decrease below @xmath7 in other experiments at low magnetic field.@xcite as for the occurrence of broken time reversal symmetry , several @xmath9 experiments show that such a possibility is rather small.@xcite    there has also been a singlet - triplet debate theoretically .",
    "some theories propose singlet pairing , @xcite , others triplet pairing mechanisms.@xcite naively , presence of possible ferromagnetic spin fluctuations reported in some experiments @xcite may support spin - fluctuation - mediated triplet pairing scenario .",
    "couple of years ago , however , two of the present authors showed that @xmath7 of spin triplet superconductivity due to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , if any , should in general be very low.@xcite a similar conclusion has been reached by monthoux and lonzarich.@xcite this is because the triplet pairing interaction mediated by spin fluctuations is proportional to @xmath10 ( in contrast to @xmath11 for the singlet case ) , where @xmath12 is the spin susceptibility , while the effective interaction that enters the normal self energy is proportional to @xmath11 , so that the suppression of pairing due to the normal self - energy overpowers the pairing effect .",
    "we then showed that this difficulty for spin - fluctuation - mediated triplet pairing may be eased in systems having ` disconnected fermi surfaces ' , where the nodal lines of the gap can run _ in between _ the fermi surfaces to open up a full gap _ on the fermi surfaces_.@xcite since pairing with high angular momentum is degraded by the presence of gap nodes on the fermi surfaces , opening a full gap may result in an enhanced pairing.@xcite as an example , we considered the hubbard model on a triangular lattice , where the fermi surface becomes disconnected into two pieces centered around the k point and the k@xmath13 point ( see fig.[fig1](a ) ) when there are a small number of holes ( or electrons , depending on the sign of the hopping integral ) .",
    "using fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation@xcite and solving the linearized liashberg equation , we have shown that a finite @xmath7 can be obtained for spin - triplet @xmath4-wave pairing , where the nodes of the gap run between the fermi surfaces.@xcite we have also confirmed this conclusion@xcite using dynamical cluster approximation,@xcite which is a non - perturbative approach . in a recent study,@xcite we have looked at the band calculation results of na@xmath14coo@xmath2@xcite from this point of view , where we find that the pocket - like fermi surfaces ( hole pockets ) near the k and k@xmath13 points ( as in the bottom figure of fig.[fig1](b ) ) , originating from the band having @xmath3 character to some extent in the notation of ref .",
    "( denoted by the thick line in fig.[fig2](a ) ) , are disconnected in a similar sense as in the triangular lattice , namely the nodes of the @xmath4-wave gap do not intersect the fermi surfaces ( although they do intersect the large fermi surface around the @xmath15 point originating from the bands having @xmath16 character ) .",
    "in fact , a strong motivation to focus on the @xmath3 hole pockets is the presence of van hove singularity ( vhs ) near the k point .",
    "namely , as can be seen from the band structure shown in fig.[fig2 ] , there exist saddle points at points denoted as sp , where the density of states ( dos ) takes a large value .",
    "since this large dos lies close to the fermi level@xcite , it is likely that the band structure around the k and k@xmath13 points strongly affects the low energy properties of this material .",
    "in particular , ferromagnetic spin fluctuations may arise due to this high dos near the fermi level .    in ref .",
    ", we have adopted a model where we separate out the portion of the bands which has @xmath3 character to some extent , and in particular focus only on the upper @xmath3 band , which contributes to the formation of the pocket fermi surfaces and to the large dos at the vhs , while neglecting the lower @xmath3 band , which has only small dos near the fermi level due to the linear dispersion at the band top .",
    "although this portion of the band , shown by the thick curves in fig.[fig2](a ) , is disconnected between m and @xmath15 points due to @xmath16-@xmath3 hybridization , it originally comes from a single band having @xmath3 character , as can be understood from the inset of fig.[fig2](a ) , where a tight binding band dispersion is given for a case when large @xmath16-@xmath3 level offset is introduced .",
    "we have found that the thick portion of the band in fig.[fig2](a ) ( apart from the missing part between m and @xmath15 points ) can be roughly reproduced by a single band tightbinding model on a triangular lattice with hopping integrals up to fourth nearest neighbors .",
    "namely , the dispersion of the tight binding model on an isotropic triangular lattice with only nearest neighbor hoppings takes its maximum at the k point ( fig.[fig1](a ) ) , while the band top moves towards the @xmath15 point when the fourth neighbor hopping is introduced ( fig.[fig1](b ) ) , resulting in a pocket like fermi surface that lies between the k and @xmath15 points when small amount of holes are present .",
    "moreover , the band structure around the k point resembles that of the actual material ( compare fig.[fig1](b ) and the thick curve in fig.[fig2 ] ) , so the vhs due to the saddle points sp in fig.[fig2 ] is also reproduced by this effective model . as for electron - electron interactions",
    ", we considered a model with only the on - site repulsion , where we found using flex that spin triplet @xmath4-wave pairing indeed dominates and has a finite @xmath7.@xcite    in the present study , we continue to study the single band model having hoppings up to fourth nearest neighbors , but this time with repulsive interactions up to second nearest neighbors to investigate the effect of the off - site repulsions .",
    "we find that ( i ) spin triplet @xmath4-wave pairing is robust to some extent even in the presence of off - site repulsions , but ( ii ) for sufficiently large off - site repulsions , singlet pairings can dominate over triplet pairings .",
    "in standard notations , the hamiltonian considered in the present study is given in the form , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the nearest , second nearest , third nearest and fourth nearest neighbor hopping integrals , respectively,@xcite and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , represent on - site , nearest neighbor , second nearest neighbor electron - electron repulsions , respectively .",
    "the summations @xmath25 and @xmath26 are taken over pairs of nearest and next nearest neighbors , respectively .",
    "we define the hole density as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron band filling ( number of electrons / number of sites ) .",
    "@xmath29 is restricted to a small number in the present study because the @xmath3 hole pockets are small .",
    "we take @xmath30 as the unit of the energy throughout the study .      to make the calculation feasible at low temperatures even in the presence of off - site repulsions up to second nearest neighbors ,",
    "here we adopt a random phase approximation ( rpa ) approach .",
    "the singlet ( @xmath31 ) and triplet ( @xmath32 ) pairing interactions are given within rpa as follows .",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the fourier transform of the off - site repulsions . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the spin and charge susceptibilities , respectively , which are given as @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the bare susceptibility given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the energy dispersion measured from the chemical potential and @xmath42 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "we take 128@xmath43128 @xmath44-point meshes in the actual numerical calculations . to obtain the onset of the superconducting state",
    ", we solve the gap equation within the weak - coupling theory , @xmath45 the transition temperature @xmath46 is determined by the condition , @xmath47 . in the present approach , @xmath48 dependence as well as the self energy correction is neglected .",
    "although this approximation is quantitatively insufficient , we believe that the present approach suffices for the purpose of discussing the _ competition _ ( relative tendency toward pairing ) among various pairing symmetries .      pairing symmetries",
    "are classified according to the irreducible representations of the point group d@xmath49 , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "for the cases we considered , the @xmath4-wave pairing having @xmath50 symmetry turned out to have small values of @xmath51 , so in the following sections we consider @xmath6 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath4 , @xmath5-wave pairings having @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 symmetry , respectively .",
    "we first show results for a case without off - site repulsions , where we take @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . as seen in fig.[fig4 ] , the @xmath4-wave pairing strongly dominates over other pairing symmetries , which is consistent with our previous study.@xcite the reason for this is : ( i ) the spin fluctuations are nearly ferromagnetic ( see fig.[fig8](a ) ) , and ( ii ) the nodes of the @xmath4-wave gap do not intersect the fermi surfaces as seen in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "we now turn on the off - site repulsions . as a case where a moderate nearest neighbor repulsion exists , we take @xmath64 and @xmath65 , while other parameter values are taken to be the same as in section [ nooffsite ] .",
    "we see in fig.[fig6 ] that the @xmath4-wave pairing still dominates over the others , but it is suppressed compared to the case without off - site repulsions .    on the other hand , @xmath51 of singlet @xmath5,@xmath53 , and @xmath6-wave pairings , along with the singlet gap functions shown in fig.[fig7 ] , are barely affected by the off - site repulsions . to understand the reason why @xmath4-wave is suppressed while singlet pairings are unaffected by off - site repulsions , we show in fig.[fig8 ] the pairing interaction in momentum space . here",
    "we define the `` spin part '' and the `` charge part '' of the pairing interaction as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the spin part peaks near the @xmath15 point , while the charge part takes a broad negative minimum value around the m point .",
    "thus , the effect of the pair scattering between two pockets that is mediated mainly by the charge part cancels out when there are nodes on the pockets ( fig.[fig9](a ) ) , while the sign change of the @xmath4-wave gap is unfavorable in the presence of the charge part , which has a negative sign ( fig.[fig9](b ) ) .      for a larger nearest neighbor repulsion , where we take the parameters values to be the same as in section [ moderate ] except that @xmath68 , we find that @xmath4-wave pairing gives way to singlet pairings , as shown in fig.[fig10 ] . among the singlet pairings , which are found to closely compete in a wide range of parameter values ,",
    "@xmath5-wave pairing surprisingly has the largest @xmath7 for the present set of parameter values .",
    "note that @xmath4-wave is no longer full - gaped on the fermi surfaces due to the additional nodes as seen in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "the reason why triplet pairings are suppressed by off - site repulsions while singlet pairings are barely affected can intuitively be understood in a real space picture . as seen in fig.[fig5 ] and fig.[fig7 ] , the triplet pairing gap functions have relatively small number of nodes , which shows that these pairing takes place at short distances in real space .",
    "in particular , @xmath4-wave gap in the absence of off - site repulsions ( fig.[fig5 ] ) essentially has the form @xmath69 , which can be rewritten , apart from a constant , as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .    since @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77",
    "are the coordinates ( in units of the lattice constant ) of the six nearest neighbors , the @xmath4-wave pairing in the absence of off - site repulsion is essentially a nearest neighbor odd - parity pairing .",
    "by contrast , the singlet pairings have many additional nodal structures compared to the basic nodal structure shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this means that the pairs are mainly formed at large distances in real space .",
    "in fact , the result that @xmath51 is unaffected by @xmath23 and @xmath24 is consistent with the picture that the singlet pairs are formed at distances farther than second nearest neighbors .",
    "the reason why singlet pairs are formed at large distances while triplet pairs are formed at short distances can intuitively be understood from a nearly ferromagnetic spin alignment in real space as shown in fig.[fig12 ] .",
    "namely , electrons at close distances have nearly parallel spins , while the electrons can have antiparallel spins only when they are separated far away .    in order to reinforce this real space intuitive picture",
    ", we look into a case where the spin susceptibility peaks at positions more closer to the @xmath15 point , namely when the spin structure is more purely ferromagnetic than in the cases considered in sections [ moderate ] and [ large ] .",
    "we take @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which moves the vhs and the fermi level towards the band edge , thus making the spin structure more ferromagnetic as seen in fig.[fig13](a ) .    as shown in fig.[fig14](a ) , the triplet pairings dominate strongly over singlet pairings , and among the triplet pairings , @xmath52-wave has the largest @xmath7 .",
    "this result can again be understood from the above real space picture .",
    "namely , since the spin susceptibility peaks around the @xmath15 point , the wave length of the spin alignment is large , so that the singlet pairing distance is large from fig.[fig12 ] . in fact",
    ", the number of nodes in the singlet pairing gaps are found to increase compared to those in section[large ] , as seen in fig.[fig15 ] .",
    "this makes the singlet pairing less competitive against triplet pairings .",
    "moreover , since the wave length of the spin alignment is large , not only electrons residing at nearest neighbors but also those separated to some extent have parallel spins , so that spin triplet pairing can take place at relatively large distances , thereby circumventing the effect of off - site repulsions .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[fig15 ] that the @xmath4-wave gap has additional nodes close to the fermi surfaces suggesting that the pairing takes place not only at nearest neighbors but also at larger distances .",
    "pairing at large distances , and thus the presence of nodes near the fermi surfaces , degrades @xmath4-wave pairing , so that @xmath52-wave pairing dominates .",
    "even if we decrease @xmath23 down to @xmath64 , @xmath52-wave still dominates over @xmath4-wave as seen fig.[fig14](b ) , in contrast to the case discussed in sections [ moderate ] .",
    "this is because in the presence of purely ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , @xmath4-wave pairing takes place at large distances even for relatively small off - site repulsions , so that the additional nodes are located close to the fermi surfaces .",
    "this can in fact be seen by comparing fig.[fig15 ] and fig.[fig16 ] , where the additional nodes in the @xmath4-wave gap do not move away so much from the fermi surfaces even if we reduce @xmath23 from 1.0 to 0.7 .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of fig.[fig7 ] and fig.[fig12 ] , where the additional nodes in the @xmath4-wave gap clearly moves away from the fermi surfaces ( i.e. , the nearest neighbor pairing component becomes large ) as we reduce @xmath23 .",
    "the reason why @xmath5-wave pairing , which has a very large angular momentum , may dominate in the presence of off - site repulsions can be found in the disconnectivity of the fermi surface _",
    "peculiar _ to the present system .",
    "namely , the fermi surfaces in the present case are disconnected in a way that they do not intersect the @xmath15-m lines nor the hexagonal brillouin zone edge , both of which are the nodal lines of the @xmath5-wave gap .",
    "thus , the number of nodal lines that intersect the fermi surfaces is similar among the three singlet pairing symmetries , extended @xmath6 , @xmath53 , and @xmath5-waves , as seen in fig.[fig11 ] , thereby making the competition subtle .",
    "in fact , we have looked into various sets of parameter values and found that the three singlet symmetries tend to have close values of @xmath51 .    to show more clearly that the subtle competition between @xmath5-wave and other singlet pairings is due to the disconnectivity of the fermi surfaces peculiar to the present system , we compare the above results with those for cases with only nearest neighbor hopping , namely with a simple triangular lattice . in a simple triangular lattice with @xmath80 ,",
    "the fermi surfaces are disconnected in a manner that they do not intersect the @xmath15-m lines , but they do intersect the brillouin zone edge .",
    "the absence of @xmath21 moves the van hove singularity away from the band top , so in order to have a moderate @xmath7 as in the cases above , we either have to take larger values of @xmath29 , or increase the values of the electron - electron interactions . here",
    "we take @xmath81 and the interactions the same as in section[large ] in fig.[fig17](a ) , while in fig.[fig17](b ) we take the same @xmath29 but take the interactions 1.5 times larger than in section[large ] .",
    "it can be seen that in both cases , @xmath51 of the @xmath5-wave pairing is much smaller than that of the @xmath53- and the @xmath6-wave pairings .",
    "this is because the fermi surfaces intersect the brillouin zone edge , i.e. , the nodes of the @xmath5-wave gap , as seen in fig.[fig18 ] and fig.[fig19 ] .      in the present study",
    ", we have looked into a model where nearly ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and charge fluctuations due to off - site repulsions coexist .",
    "it is interesting to compare the present situation with the case where _ antiferromagnetic _ spin fluctuations and charge fluctuations coexist .",
    "we have previously proposed that spin - triplet pairing is possible in a quarter - filled , quasi-1d organic material ( tmtsf)@xmath2x,@xcite where superconductivity lies right next to spin density wave ( sdw ) in the pressure - temperature phase diagram , so that the spin fluctuations should be antiferromagnetic .",
    "naively , antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations would favor spin singlet @xmath53-wave pairing , while experiments suggest triplet pairing.@xcite our proposal is that if @xmath82 ( @xmath83 because the band is quarter - filled ) charge fluctuations coexist with @xmath82 spin fluctuations , as suggested from an experimental fact that cdw actually coexist with sdw@xcite , spin triplet ` @xmath4-wave ' like pairing , which is essentially a fourth neighbor pairing having a gap form of @xmath84 ( this is called @xmath4-wave in the sense that the gap changes sign as @xmath85 along the fermi surface ) , may become competitive against singlet ` @xmath53-wave ' like pairing , which is a second neighbor pairing with a gap form @xmath86 . in momentum space , this close competition arises because ( i ) the number of nodes of the @xmath4-wave gap on the fermi surface is the same with that of the @xmath53-wave because of the disconnectivity of the fermi surfaces due to quasi - one - dimensionality , and ( ii ) the pairing interactions due to spin and charge fluctuations ( apart from the first order terms ) have the form @xmath87 for singlet pairing and @xmath88 for triplet pairing , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are contributions from spin and charge fluctuations , respectively , so that the absolute values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 becomes comparable when @xmath93 .",
    "a similar theory has been proposed by fuseya _",
    "et al._@xcite recently , we have confirmed this scenario microscopically by applying rpa to an extended hubbard model with off - site repulsions up to third nearest neighbors.@xcite here , a key parameter is the second nearest neighbor repulsion , due to which the @xmath82 charge fluctuations arises .    in real space , this @xmath4-@xmath53 competition can be understood as follows .",
    "when there are purely antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , second neighbor singlet pairing is likely to occur , as seen from fig.[fig20 ] .",
    "if we now turn on the second nearest neighbor repulsion , the second neighbor singlet pairing is degraded , and a fourth neighbor triplet pairing becomes competitive .",
    "since this intuitive picture in real space is rather general , the tendency that spin singlet pairing , which is favored by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , gives way to triplet pairings in the presence of sufficiently large off - site repulsions , should hold in various situations .",
    "in fact , such a singlet - triplet crossover due to off - site repulsions is seen also in a half - filled quasi-1d system,@xcite a model for sr@xmath2ruo@xmath94 on a 2d square lattice,@xcite and a model for na@xmath0coo@xmath2 on a 2d triangular lattice .",
    "@xcite    now , it is interesting to point out that the above tendency is exactly the opposite of what has happened in the present case with nearly ferromagnetic spin fluctuations : triplet pairings formed at relatively short distances give way to singlet pairings formed at farther distances when sufficiently large off - site repulsions are introduced .",
    "thus , the effect of the off - site repulsion totally differs depending on whether the spin fluctuations are ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "it is also important to note that in both cases , the disconnectivity of the fermi surfaces can assist the pairings at large distances ( singlet in the ferromagnetic case and triplet in the antiferromagnetic case ) , which have larger number of nodes in the gap function .      in the present study ,",
    "we have focused only on the @xmath3 fermi pockets .",
    "although it is necessary to consider a multiband model@xcite in order to strictly take into account the effect of the fermi pockets , our single band approach is supported by a recent multiband flex study,@xcite where a similar @xmath4-wave pairing is found to dominate when spin fluctuations are not too purely ferromagnetic .",
    "experimentally , the fermi pockets are not observed in arpes experiments @xcite up to date .",
    "however , since these experiments are done for materials with relatively large na content , ( i.e. , large number of electrons in coo layers ) it is likely that the fermi level lies above the @xmath3 bands .",
    "@xcite in fact , an experimental result that maximum @xmath7 is reached only when the content of na decreases sufficiently@xcite can be considered as an indirect support for scenario in which the @xmath3 band plays an important role for superconductivity .",
    "let us finally discuss the pairing symmetry in the cobaltate in light of the present results along with the existing experiments .",
    "we have seen that `` full - gapped '' @xmath4-wave proposed in ref .",
    "is robust to some extent even in the presence of off - site repulsions .",
    "existence of nodes in the gap function is suggested in a number of experiments,@xcite which may seem to contradict with the @xmath4-wave scenario . in the actual na@xmath0coo@xmath2 , however , there is also the large fermi surface around the @xmath15 point , which is not taken into account in the present study .",
    "then we can propose a possible scenario where the ` active ' fermi surfaces for superconductivity are the pockets , while the large fermi surface is a passive one , in which superconductivity is induced by the ` active ' band via interband interactions . since the nodes of the @xmath4-wave gap intersects the large fermi surface , this can account for the experimental results suggesting the existence of gap nodes . in fact",
    ", it has been shown that a @xmath95sr data can be explained by taking this view.@xcite    on the other hand , singlet pairings are found to dominate over triplet pairings in the present model when spin fluctuations are not purely ferromagnetic and the off - site repulsions are sufficiently large . among the singlet symmetries , @xmath5-wave is another good candidate that competes with @xmath4-wave since it does not break time reversal symmetry below @xmath7 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath5-wave may dominate over other symmetries , but the parameter range where this symmetry dominates is not so wide as that for the @xmath4-wave .",
    "although extended @xmath6-wave is also consistent with almost all the existing experiments , we could not find a parameter regime where this symmetry dominates .",
    "however , considering the fact that the competition within the singlet pairings is very subtle , and that the present model only roughly takes into account the electronic structure of the actual material , we believe the possibility of extended @xmath6-wave pairing can not be ruled out .    since @xmath53-wave and @xmath52-wave pairings are likely to result in a broken time reversal symmetry and/or a full gapped state ( unless an accidental situation occurs ) below @xmath7 due to the two - fold degeneracy , we believe that the possibility of these pairing states are less likely .",
    "we may conversely say from the present results that the spin fluctuation in the actual cobaltate is not _",
    "ferromagnetic and/or the off - site repulsions are not too large , so that @xmath52-wave pairing does not dominate .    at present , it is not clear experimentally whether the pairing occurs in the singlet or in the triplet channel because knight shift experiments are done on polycrystal samples .",
    "in order to settle this singlet - triplet debate , knight shift experiment for high quality samples , or alternatively , tunneling spectroscopy studies based on a newly developed theory for triplet superconductors proposed by one of the present authors@xcite is required .",
    "thus , our viewpoint is that possibility of neither singlet nor triplet pairings can not be ruled out experimentally at the present stage .",
    "then , the bottom line obtained from the present study , combined with the existing experimental facts , is that triplet @xmath4-wave pairing is most likely , although there remains a possibility of singlet @xmath5-wave pairing , and also a possibility of extended @xmath6-wave pairing can not be ruled out .",
    "this ambiguity is a direct consequence of the very point of the present study .",
    "namely , the present system is highly peculiar in that anisotropic pairings having large angular momentum , such as @xmath4- and @xmath5- waves , are good candidates due to the disconnectivity of the fermi surfaces . the fact that these `` unusual '' pairing symmetries are good candidates makes the pairing competition subtle .",
    "to summarize , we have studied an effective single band model for the hydrated sodium cobaltate focusing on the @xmath3 hole pockets , where we take into account off - site repulsions up to second nearest neighbors .",
    "we find that @xmath4-wave pairing proposed in our previous study is robust to some extent in the presence of off - site repulsions . for large off - site repulsions",
    ", @xmath4-wave gives way to singlet pairings that does not break time reversal symmetry below @xmath7 .",
