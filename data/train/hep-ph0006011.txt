    "electron - proton scattering at hera is dominated by the exchange of a quasi - real photon and a fraction of @xmath4-@xmath5 collisions leads to the production of high @xmath6 jets .",
    "therefore these processes can be predicted by perturbative qcd and they can be used to investigate the structure of the photon in a way complementary to the study of the deep inelastic scattering @xmath7-@xmath4 . in the latter case , one can measure directly the quark density inside the photon whereas the gluon density is constrained by the evolution equation . on the contrary , in photoproduction",
    ", one can probe directly the gluon contents of the photon .",
    "leading logarithm ( ll ) results have been available for a long time , but they are plagued by sizeable uncertainties coming from the dependence on unphysical scales .",
    "therefore , next to leading logarithm ( nll ) calculations are essential to describe the photoproduction of jets . to reach this goal ,",
    "we have adapted a method developped previously to deal with the production of two high-@xmath6 hadrons in hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "we apply it to build a monte - carlo generator which is able to produce a set of partonic events on which one can apply any jet reconstruction algorithm to produce a set of jet events . with the latter we can easily compute any infrared safe cross sections .",
    "this technique gives a lot of flexibility to the study of various jet algorithms and observables .",
    "in particular we will apply it to the study of two jet observables in which the distribution function variables are well constrained by kinematics .",
    "this allows us to disentangle the distribution functions from the hard subprocess more easily , because less convolutions are involved in the calculation of the cross sections .",
    "some results obtained with this approach have already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework is described in section  [ theory ] .",
    "we also compare our approach with those of other authors . in section  [ 1jet ]",
    "we present some applications of our work to 1-jet cross sections and we compare our results with those already obtained with an analytical approach . section  [ 2jet ] is devoted to the study of 2-jet observables",
    ". we will examine whether it is possible to accurately measure the distribution functions of the gluon in the photon and in the proton .",
    "in section  [ h1-zeus ] we study recent h1 and zeus data and the constraints they put on the gluon distributions .",
    "the conclusions are in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "to calculate cross sections and isolate collinear and infrared singularities , we used a `` phase space slicing method '' .",
    "we start from the @xmath8 partonic squared matrix elements and virtual corrections evaluated by ellis and sexton @xcite .",
    "collinear and infra - red singularities lead to poles in @xmath9 and @xmath10 when using dimensional regularisation . for a generic real process @xmath11 ,",
    "at least two partons have high transverse energy @xmath12 ( 3 and 4 ) and only one can be soft ( 5 ) . in order to extract the singularities",
    ", we cut the phase space in several parts : part i where @xmath13 is less than a given scale @xmath14 and part ii where @xmath15 .",
    "part ii is divided in three parts : iia ( resp .",
    "iib ) where parton 5 is within a cone around parton 3 ( resp .",
    "4 ) called @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) , iic where parton 5 is outside @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "parton 5 is in @xmath18 if @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the pseudo - rapidity and @xmath21 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "part i contains infra - red singularities and collinear singularities in the initial state and parts iia and iib contain collinear singularities in the final state whereas part iic is finite .",
    "the contributions of regions i , iia and iib are calculated analytically and the infra - red singularities are cancelled by the corresponding ones in the virtual terms .",
    "initial collinear singularities are factorised in the parton distributions and the final collinear singularities disappear when integrating on the relative momentum between parton 5 and the parton with which it is collinear due to energy momentum sum rules .",
    "the finite parts remaining after the cancellation of singularities have been analytically computed using maple @xcite .",
    "large logarithms @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 appear in the collinear and infrared contributions .",
    "they are cancelled by similar terms from part iic so that the total cross section is independent of these unphysical cuts .",
    "it should be noted that we have kept only the logarithmic terms in the calculation of contributions i , iia and iib , neglecting terms of order @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and less singular terms .    using the monte - carlo package bases @xcite",
    ", our program generates quasi @xmath27 events corresponding to collinear , born and virtual contributions ( we take @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 events corresponding to part iic . for the latter ,",
    "a jet reconstruction algorithm is applied . finally , these events are histogrammed  @xcite in order to give any cross sections we are interested in .",
    "we have checked that the cross sections do not depend on the unphysical cuts @xmath14 and @xmath31 in the region where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . from a numerical point of view",
    ", the compensation between this cut dependence arises mainly between positive real contribution of part iic and negative contributions of part i , iia , iib and virtual corrections  ; we need to generate a sufficient number of events in order to obtain a small error after the compensation .",
    "we take the greatest possible values for the cuts @xmath14 and @xmath31 ( i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) in order to lower the size of this compensation which is then typically of the order of 1 for 5 .",
    "this approach is applied to the direct and resolved ( proportional to the photon distribution functions ) parts of the cross section .",
    "however these contributions depend on the convention adopted in the subtraction of the collinear singularities .",
    "unless explicitly specified , we use the @xmath36 factorization and renormalization schemes .",
    "several authors have used similar approaches in the calculation of jet - photoproduction cross sections .",
    "harris and owens @xcite also built an event generator  ; but their phase slicing is based on cuts put on @xmath37 ( in the parton cm ) and on the mandelstam variables of the subprocess which control the collinear divergences .",
    "klasen and kramer @xcite introduced a single invariant cut on the mandelstam variables . on the other hand frixione and ridolfi @xcite made their calculations with the subtraction method @xcite .",
    "we made several numerical comparisons with the results of klasen and kramer , and found a good agreement .",
    "finally let us note that it is very convenient to use variables @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath21 to define regions of the phase space in which we perform analytical calculations .",
    "indeed these are the variables commonly used by experimentalists to define jets and cuts in their phase space .",
    "if @xmath40 and @xmath31 are smaller than respectively the lower bound of the transverse momenta and the width of jets , we never integrate ( thus defining an inclusive measurement ) in a phase space region in which the experimentalists perform an exclusive measurement . since these experimental bounds are much larger than the domain in which our neglecting non logarithmic terms is valid this is in fact not a constraint at all .",
    "on the contrary with the invariant cut method , this can only be achieved with very small cuts .",
    "in this section we present some numerical results for one - jet cross sections in order to compare our predictions with those obtained in a preceding paper @xcite .",
    "our inputs are the following . at the hera collider ( @xmath41  gev )",
    ", electrons produce photons with small virtuality @xmath42 .",
    "we use the kinematical conditions of the zeus collaboration @xcite : @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the spectrum of the quasi - real photon is approximated by the weizscker - williams formula .",
    "@xmath46    for the proton distributions we take the cteq4 m parametrization @xcite and for the photon distributions the grv parametrization @xcite transformed to the @xmath36 scheme .",
    "we use five flavours , @xmath47  mev , a renormalization scale @xmath48 and a factorization scale @xmath49 equal to the transverse energy @xmath38 of the jet . for all our calculations ,",
    "we use for @xmath50 an exact solution of the two - loop renormalization group equation , and not an expansion in @xmath51 .",

    "jets are defined with the @xmath57-algorithm @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with those of a previous analytical calculation  @xcite , for the transverse momentum distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig:1jet]a and for the rapidity distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig:1jet]b .",
    "we can see that the agreement is quite good between these two sets of results .",
    "similar comparisons hold for the direct part .",
    "we do not pursue the study of 1-jet cross sections , because they do not constrain the parton distributions as well as the 2-jet cross sections do  ; the latter offer more kinematical possibilities of control of the @xmath58-variable of these distributions .",
    "in this section we study the dijet cross sections and put the emphasis on variables and cross sections which give access to the gluon distribution functions .",
    "comparison between data and theory is postponed to section 5 .",
    "the dijet cross section , as a function of the transverse energy @xmath59 and the jet rapidities @xmath60 and @xmath61 , is given by a product if the subprocess is a @xmath62 reaction ( ll approximation )    @xmath63    @xmath64 is the @xmath65 cross section , and @xmath66 the parton distributions in the electron ( proton ) ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 )  ; @xmath49 is the factorization scale and @xmath48 the renormalization scale .",
    "the direct contribution corresponds to @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the weizscker - williams formula ( [ 1e ] ) . in the resolved case ,",
    "@xmath71 is given by a convolution of @xmath70 with the parton distribution in the photon    @xmath72    if the photon energy @xmath73 is known ( for instance by tagging the outgoing electron ) , we can measure @xmath74 and define the observable    @xmath75    thus the dijet cross section written as a function of @xmath74 is proportional to the parton distribution in the photon @xmath76 .",
    "one observes that the direct contribution , with @xmath77 , leads to a peak in the cross section at @xmath78 .     and",
    "@xmath79 , with the following cuts on the two high @xmath12 jets : @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the @xmath57-algorithm for the definition of jets . , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    nll qcd corrections to the ll expression ( [ ll - xgamobs ] ) blur its simple kinematics .",
    "there are contributions with three jets in the final state , and we can no longer fix @xmath83 , because the third jet is not observed . however we can follow the strategy of the zeus collaboration @xcite which defines the variable ( jets 3 and 4 are the jets with the highest transverse energies ) @xmath84 and observe the dijet cross section @xmath79",
    ". however this definition of @xmath85 may lead to infrared sensitive cross sections .",
    "indeed fixing @xmath59 @xmath86 strongly constrains the available phase space of the unobserved partons ( for instance parton 5 in section 2 ) and forbids a complete compensation between real and virtual nll corrections .",
    "this results in cross sections containing , for instance , terms proportional to @xmath87 after an integration over @xmath86 from a lower bound @xmath88 ( smaller than @xmath59 ) has been performed .",
    "the cross section is not defined at @xmath89 , although it is integrable .",
    "therefore the variable @xmath90 defined in ( [ def - xgamobs ] ) should only be used with cross sections integrated over @xmath59 and @xmath86  ; moreover the integration range of @xmath59 and @xmath86 should not have the same bounds .",
    "a discussion of this condition may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for these reasons ,",
    "we prefer the variable @xmath91 which depends on the transverse energy of only one jet .",
    "it can be associated with cross sections in which the energy of the second jet is not measured .",
    "one observes that @xmath92 may take values larger than 1.0 .",
    "one must also observe that the cross sections @xmath93 or @xmath94 are singular when @xmath92 or @xmath90 approaches 1 .",
    "indeed we have the condition    @xmath95    ( the sign = corresponds to the direct case ) , which means    @xmath96    when @xmath90 goes to 1 , the phase space of parton 5 is severely restricted .",
    "this results in @xmath97 terms generated by the nll corrections .",
    "we obtain a similar result with @xmath98 , although the phase space of parton 5 is less severely constrained than by condition ( [ 7e ] ) .",
    "therefore we expect a smoother behaviour of @xmath99 .",
    "this point can be verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : xgamll - xgamobs ] in which we display @xmath100 and @xmath93 for the direct term .",
    "besides the region very close to 1.0 , the two distributions are very similar .",
    "depends on the width of the @xmath74-bin , because the born and virtual contributions are proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "if the width is too small , the cross section may even be negative ( the positive real contributions do not compensate anymore the negative virtual contributions ) . ] ( the afg @xcite and abfow @xcite distributions with @xmath102 have been used for this calculation ) .",
    "currently experimentalists integrate @xmath90 over the range @xmath103 .",
    "therefore the singular behaviour of the cross section is smoothed and should not forbid the phenonemological application of nll calculations .",
    "[ lc][lc][0.8][0]@xmath36 [ lc][lc][0.8][0]@xmath104 [ lc][lc][0.8][0]afg [ lc][lc][0.8][0]grv    we can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : xgamll - xgamobs ] how much nll corrections modify the @xmath74 distribution which is proportional to @xmath101 at the ll accuracy .",
    "nll corrections generate terms with @xmath90 or @xmath92 different from 1 and the simple picture of a photon directly interacting with a quark of the hard subprocess at @xmath105 is lost .",
    "but one must also keep in mind that the separation of the cross section @xmath106 into a direct part and a resolved part is factorization scheme dependent and that @xmath107 has no physical sense on its own ( the same remark is valid for @xmath92 ) .    to study this problem we computed the observable @xmath93 in two factorization schemes , the so - called @xmath108 and @xmath36 ones .",
    "for the resolved part , we used for the former case the grv distributions of quarks inside the photon and for the latter the afg distributions .",
    "( here we also use the abfow proton distributions ) .",
    "we can see that both the direct and resolved part are very different in these two schemes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xgamll - afg - grv ] ) , but that this difference is much smaller for the total cross section which is factorization scheme independent .",
    "the remaining difference partly comes from different hadronic inputs in the two sets of distributions .",
    "we now turn to the study of the gluon contents of the photon and to the possibility of constraining it through the observation of the distribution @xmath94 .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath94 to the gluon distribution does not only depend on the value of @xmath90 , but also on the various kinematical cuts imposed on the 2-jet phase space .",
    "clearly the region of positive and large rapidities corresponds to small values of @xmath90 and to an enhancement of @xmath94 .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "we divided the rapidity range in the lab frame for the two leading jets in subintervals : @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we have also used asymmetric cuts on the transverse momenta , as it is done by experimental collaborations , in order to avoid the instabilities which appear when these momenta become close to each other .",
    "then in each of these rapidity intervals we compared the @xmath85 distribution obtained with the afg photon density with cross - sections for which we have artificially reduced and increased the gluon distribution by 30  % .",
    "we found that the influence of the gluon increases with the rapidities and in fact the differences between these three curves become sizeable only when @xmath110 . indeed an increase of 30  % of the gluon density results in an increase of approximately 25  % for the cross - section around @xmath111 . therefore a determination of the gluon contents of the photon would require to use such cuts on rapidities . such a study would be able to test the gluon density @xmath112 in the region @xmath113 where it is very poorly known",
    "in this section we analyse recent h1 and zeus data to assess the possibility to put constraints on the gluon distributions in the photon and in the proton . with this intention",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of various cross sections to changes in the gluon distributions , and we compare their variations to the experimental errors . in this way we obtained an estimate of the accuracy with which gluon distributions can be extracted from present data , and from future high statistics experiments .",
    "we modify the gluon distributions by increasing or decreasing their normalizations by a few tens of percents .",
    "this method has the advantage of leaving unchanged the well - determined quark distributions and to quantify the gluon modifications in a simple way .",
    "of course gluon distributions are constrained by other experiments .",
    "but , as discussed in the introduction , the gluon in the photon is not well constrained by dis @xmath114 data . as for the gluon in the proton we are going to study observables sensitive to the distribution at small @xmath115 . in this region",
    "the gluon is pinpointed by the slope of @xmath116 and it was shown by the cteq collaboration that a variation of about @xmath117 of @xmath118 in this region and at a scale of 100 gev would cause clear disagreements with dis plus drell - yan data @xcite .",
    "however this conclusion was not obtained by performing an error analysis but only by tuning the gluon parametrisation , which might artificially reduce the range of variation by being too restrictive .",
    "a more recent study obtained a gluon density 30% bigger than cteq4 m about @xmath115 and at a scale of 20 gev @xcite .",
    "errors on the gluon determination are also presented in ref .",
    "thus we think that it is interesting to find how much photoproduction can constrain this density in this x - range .",
    "the interested reader may find more global comparisons between theory and data in ref @xcite .",
    "the inputs we use in this section have been defined in section 3 where we computed single - jet cross sections .",
    "more details on the kinematical parameters used for dijet cross sections are given below .",
    "compared with zeus data @xcite .",

    "therefore we do not have a direct access to @xmath100 , however we can study data corresponding to regions of the jet phase space in which the role of the gluon in the photon or that of the gluon in the proton is enhanced .",
    "these regions are essentially defined by large or small values of the jet rapidities : large rapidities correspond to small @xmath74 and small rapidities to small @xmath123 ( see the ll expressions for @xmath124 and @xmath125 below formula ( [ ll - pt - etas ] ) ) .",
    "let us start with the case of large jet rapidities .",
    "experiment and theory are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the dijet cross sections in this figure correspond to events with at least one jet with transverse energy larger than 14 gev , the transverse energy of the other jet being larger than 11 gev  ; it is integrated over @xmath126 .",
    "the real photon kinematical domain is specified by @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( cf expression ( [ 1e ] ) ) .",
    "the jets are defined with the @xmath57-algorithm @xcite and the scales @xmath49 and @xmath48 are set equal to the transverse energy of the most energetic jet .    to test the sensitivity of @xmath129 to the gluon density in the photon",
    ", we increased the gluon distribution uniformly by a factor of 1.2 . comparing the full and dashed curves",
    ", we see that this factor produces an increase of the cross section for large values of @xmath130 by some 10  % .",
    "as expected the backward region , corresponding to large values of @xmath74 , is not affected  ; the gluon distribution in the photon decreases much faster than the quark distributions . in this region",
    "@xmath129 rapidly varies with @xmath130 and better comparison with data is obtained by integrating @xmath131 in the experimental bins .",
    "this has been done for the two bins : @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the agreement between theory and data is quite good in the second bin but the data at larger @xmath130 favor a larger gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "but one must notice that the present experimental errors are larger than the effect produced by an increase of the gluon distribution by 20  % . in the backward region ,",
    "a clear discrepancy appears which could be attributed to hadronization effects as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is also worth again noting the great sensitivity of the cross section to the @xmath134-range of the photon .",
    "the energy of the incoming photon is reconstructed from the final hadron energies with the jacquet - blondel method .",
    "various corrections have to be applied to this `` photon energy '' @xmath135 in order to obtain the true photon energy @xmath134 @xcite . in fig .  [ fig:5 ]",
    "we show the effect of a 10  % error on the determination of the lower bound of the @xmath134 variable .",
    "it is very large for negative values of @xmath130 . even in the forward region",
    ", this 10  % error produces an effect much larger than the 20  % variation of the gluon distribution .",
    "actually this `` error '' is included in the discussion of the systematic errors quoted in @xcite .",
    "but because the dispersion of @xmath135 around @xmath134 may reach 10  % , a better theoretical prediction could be obtained by taking into account the dispersion of the upper and lower bounds of the variable @xmath134 .",

    "[ fig:6 ] that the cross section depends very little on moderate changes of the gluon distribution in the photon .",

    "a decrease of the gluon distribution in the proton would decrease @xmath94 in all bins in @xmath170 .",
    "it is compatible with data at low @xmath90 , but its effect at large @xmath90 is not sufficient to put theory in agreement with data . the resolved contribution is also important in the highest @xmath90-bin , a kinematical region which explores the quark contents of the photon at large @xmath74 . in this domain the quark distribution is given by the pointlike component ( non pointlike contributions of the `` vector meson dominance '' type are negligible ) which can not be modified in an arbitrary way , and adjusted to data .",

    "part of the errors should cancel in the ratio    @xmath175    which could allow a better determination of the @xmath58 shape of the distributions functions .",

    "in this paper we described a new nll event generator for photoproduction reactions involving the direct and resolved contributions , and we used it to assess the possibility to measure the quark and gluon contents of the photon from photoproduction experiments .",
    "( actually we assumed that the quark distributions in the photon were fixed from @xmath176 dis experiments and we concentrated on the gluon contents ) .",
    "the cross section @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is related to the scaled momentum @xmath74 of partons in the photon , is quite appropriate to a study of these contents .",
    "we discussed two definitions of @xmath178  : @xmath179 , the well - known definition of the zeus collaboration , and @xmath180 , a variable which reduces problems of infrared sensitivity .",
    "then we showed that the cross section @xmath106 is sensitive to the gluon density of the photon only if we require the two jets with the highest transverse energy to have positive rapidities .",
    "a relatively good agreement between theory and experiment is found when confronting the predictions , obtained with the cteq4 m and grv distributions , with h1 and zeus data .",
    "it is interesting to note that h1 and zeus data are compatible with a 20  % increase of the gluon contents of the photon ( fig .  6 , @xmath181 , fig .  8 , @xmath182  gev ) and with a 20  % decrease of the gluon contents of the proton ( fig .  5 , @xmath183 where the direct contribution is important  ; fig .",
    "unfortunately this remark can not be made more quantitative , because the systematic errors , essentially coming from the uncertainties in the measurement of the jet energies , are large and of the same order as the variations of the theoretical predictions due to gluon distribution modifications .",
    "one must also keep in mind the great sensitivity of the cross section to the photon energy - range .",
    "the knowledge of the resolution of the variable @xmath134 ( obtained from the jacquet - blondel variable @xmath184 ) should allow a more accurate prediction .",
    "however it is interesting to remark that 1996 and 1997 preliminary zeus data @xcite also favor a larger gluon distribution in the photon .    until now we have not discussed the theoretical uncertainties coming from the scale dependence of the cross sections .",
    "these uncertainties were carefully studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , and found to be of the order of a few tens of percents for large variations of the values of the factorization and renormalization scales . in this paper we continue this study by looking at the sensitivity of the cross section @xmath185 which can be compared with h1 data ( fig .  5 )  ; we make this study for the range @xmath103 and with the kinematical conditions of fig .",
    "the scales are @xmath186 and @xmath187 is varied between @xmath188 and @xmath189 our results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "* table 1 * : the sensitivity of the direct and resolved photoproduction cross - sections to the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath190 ( normalized to the total contribution at @xmath191 ) .",
    "+ we note that the cross section @xmath94 is quite stable and varies by less than 5  % when the scales @xmath192 vary by a factor 16 .",
    "the theoretical errors appear to be well under control , at least for this observable .",
    "so we can conclude that , in the future , the possibility to accurately determine the gluon distribution in the photon relies on the possibility to improve the experimental systematic errors . in the future",
    "also statistics will be larger and higher @xmath38 regions will be accessible .",
    "the corresponding data will put more constraints on the parton distributions .",
