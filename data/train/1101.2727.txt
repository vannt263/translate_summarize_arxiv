    "however , rigorous proofs of the existence of an asymptotic expansion of @xmath10 in powers of @xmath11 were provided only rather more recently by ercolani and mclaughlin  @xcite and by bleher and its  @xcite .",
    "these analyses prove the existence of a genus expansion of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for the gaussian free energy , @xmath14 under the assumption that there is a path @xmath15 in the space of coupling parameters connecting @xmath16 to the gaussian potential @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath18 is a regular one - cut model for all @xmath19 .",
    "the functions @xmath20 are important objects because the coefficients of their taylor expansions at the gaussian point @xmath21 are generating functions for the enumeration of labeled @xmath1-maps with vertices involving valences @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of nonvanishing coupling parameters @xmath24 .",
    "the general aim of the present work is the characterization of the structure of these functions @xmath20 .",

    "the large @xmath0 asymptotics of the matrix model  ( [ 0.1 ] ) is intimately connected with the asymptotics of the recurrence coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the three - term recursion relation @xmath27 for the orthogonal polynomials @xmath28 with respect to the exponential weight @xmath29 in particular  @xcite , in the limit @xmath30 the density of zeros of @xmath31 reduces to the eigenvalue density of the matrix model @xmath32 , and if @xmath32 is a regular one - cut model then  @xcite the recurrence coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be expanded in powers of @xmath11  @xcite .    the methods that exploit this relation with orthogonal polynomials to calculate the asymptotics of the free energy essentially consist of three steps :    1 .",

    "also  @xcite ) or on formulating the matrix model as a conformal field theory  @xcite . however , the structure of the expressions for the @xmath20 that these methods provide is less suitable than ours to compute generating functions for the enumeration of labeled @xmath1-maps .    in this paper",
    "we present an efficient method to calculate the topological expansion of the free energy and to characterize its coefficients . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our analysis to hermitian models associated to even potentials @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "we now preview how our approach performs the three steps and point out the differences with respect to other schemes .",
    "the classical method of bessis , itzykson and zuber  @xcite is based on the following identity ( step  1 ) : @xmath35 wherein the expansion of @xmath25 is substituted ( step 2 ) , and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath10 is obtained by means of the euler - maclaurin summation formula ( step 3 ) . however , some objections to this approach were raised by ercolani and mclaughlin ( cf .  subsection  1.5 in  @xcite ) due to the use of the asymptotic series of @xmath25 as a uniform expansion valid even for @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "this objection triggered the interest in alternative strategies for step  1  @xcite .",
    "for example ,",
    "ercolani , mclaughlin and pierce  @xcite derived a hierarchy of second order differential equations to determine the coefficients of the expansion  ( [ bif20 ] ) from those of the the asymptotic expansion of @xmath25 . in our work we use instead the bleher - its integral representation @xcite @xmath38{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t.\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the bleher - its deformation  @xcite @xmath39 or explicitly in terms of the coupling parameters , @xmath40    for step  2 the standard methods  @xcite use recursive equations for the coefficients @xmath25 ( string equations ) to determine expansions of the form @xmath41 bessis , itzykson and zuber  @xcite formulated the string equation in terms of summations of paths over a certain staircase .",
    "some years later shirokura  @xcite developed a general method to perform these summations and characterize the coefficients of the expansion  ( [ in1 ] ) in terms of the single function @xmath42 to solve the string equation , in this paper we introduce a generating function @xmath43 associated to the resolvent of the finite - difference lax operator @xmath44 of the underlying toda hierarchy  @xcite @xmath45 and determine the coefficients of  ( [ in1 ] ) from the function  ( [ in2 ] ) as rational functions of the leading coefficient @xmath46 .",
    "this approach is simpler that shirokura s method , is particularly suitable for symbolic computation , can be applied to a generic potential , and permits an easy characterization of the asymptotics of the bleher - its deformation @xmath47 of the recurrence coefficient .",
    "finally , regarding step  3 , the bleher - its representation  ( [ bif ] ) allows us to express the coefficients of the topological expansion as @xmath48 where the integrands @xmath49 are rational functions of @xmath50 which can be computed explicitly in terms of the function  ( [ in2 ] ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we briefly review the basic facts about matrix models which are required to discuss the bleher - its deformation and the conditions that ensure the existence of the expansion  ( [ bif20 ] ) .",
    "then we apply our results to the quartic model and to the sixtic model of brezin , marinari and parisi  @xcite .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the asymptotic expansion  ( [ in1 ] ) of the recurrence coefficient for general models @xmath51 and their respective bleher - its deformations @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , we rederive in a much shorter way the expressions for the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 found by shirokura  @xcite .",
    "section  4 deals with the asymptotics of the free energy . from the bleher - its representation  ( [ bif ] ) and the expansion of the recurrence coefficients we obtain the integral expression  ( [ int4 ] ) .",
    "we evaluate explicitly the integrals for the @xmath55 up to genus  3 in the general case and find , except for a coefficient in the expression of @xmath56 , the same results found by shirokura  @xcite .",
    "we also check that the expressions of these coefficients for general two - valence models reduce to those obtained using the ercolani - mclaughlin - pierce method  @xcite . in the brief section  5",
    "we discuss how to apply our method to compute counting maps functions and present explicit calculations for two and three valence models . in section  6 we formulate a `` triple scaling '' method to regularize the free energy expansion of a class of singular models ( the singular one - cut case ) and show how the painlev  i hierarchy emerges in our approach .",

    "the third of these terms , which involves the tracy - widom distribution function  @xcite , represents a nonperturbative effect .",
