    "observational studies of galaxy interactions and mergers have a long history , beginning with the identification of a sample of close galaxy pairs by @xcite .",
    "detailed multi - wavelength observations of nearby pairs such as the antennae ( ngc 4038/4039 ) yield strong evidence for ongoing mergers , including tidal tails , induced star formation , and multiple nuclei .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation indicate that mergers and accretion events play a key role in building up the galaxy populations we see today ( coles 2005 ) .",
    "there is growing interest in quantifying the contribution that mergers have played in forming the galaxies we see in the nearby universe .",
    "recent efforts have focussed on two central questions : ( 1 ) how often do mergers take place ? and ( 2 ) what effects do mergers have on the constituent galaxies ?",
    "the answers to both questions are certain to vary with cosmic time , and therefore require the observation of merging systems at a wide range of redshifts . in this paper",
    ", we analyze hubble space telescope ( hereafter hst ) images of a sample of galaxy pairs at intermediate redshifts , with the goal of shedding new light on both issues at a lookback time of several gigayears .",
    "attempts to address the first question have centred on measurement of the galaxy merger rate , and its evolution with redshift . in recent years",
    ", many of these studies have used close galaxy pairs to identify systems in which mergers are imminent @xcite .",
    "the number of close companions per galaxy is taken to be proportional to the galaxy merger rate .",
    "alternatively , one can identify merging systems using quantitative measurements of galaxy asymmetries ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the resulting merger fraction is assumed to be proportional to the galaxy merger rate .",
    "these two methods are independent and complementary .",
    "close galaxy pairs probe early stage mergers , while strong asymmetries are more likely to identify later stage mergers , including merger remnants .",
    "there should be considerable overlap between these samples if the galaxy pairs are close enough to include strongly interacting systems .    until now",
    ", however , there has been very little evidence to confirm this assumption .",
    "most high redshift pair samples have been identified using ground - based telescopes , and therefore yield minimal morphological information ( e.g. , patton et al .",
    "@xcite did have hst imaging of 285 galaxies at high redshift ; however , they had redshifts for only one member of each pair . at low redshift , @xcite estimated that @xmath6 30% of their close pairs exhibit convincing evidence of interactions on digitized sky survey images .",
    "however , their classifications were made by eye , and therefore difficult to compare with quantitative measurements of asymmetry .    in this study",
    ", we aim to rectify these shortcomings by analyzing the structural properties of dynamically close galaxy pairs identified by patton et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter p2002 ) , using high resolution imaging from hst .",
    "the following section describes the observations and data reduction , and the identification of paired and isolated galaxies is outlined in   [ sample ]",
    ". a statistical comparison of the structural parameters of these two samples is provided in   [ comparison ] .",
    "we estimate the asymmetry fraction of paired and isolated galaxies in   [ asymfrac ] , and compare their star forming properties in   [ sf ] .",
    "the results are discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] , and followed by our conclusions in   [ conclusions ] . for consistency with the sample selection of p2002 , we adopt a cosmology of @xmath7=100 km s@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10=0 .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to examine the structural properties of galaxies in merging pairs , and to compare the results with those of isolated galaxies .",
    "this requires high resolution imaging of a sample of confirmed close pairs , along with a control sample of field galaxies . in this section , we describe the identification of a sample of dynamically close galaxy pairs from the cnoc2 survey , and the acquisition of hst imaging for a subset of these pairs .",
    "the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey @xcite contains redshifts for approximately 6000 galaxies at redshifts of @xmath11 .",
    "images and spectra were acquired using the multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) at the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "this survey covers four well - separated patches on the sky , covering @xmath12 deg@xmath13 to a depth of @xmath14 = 21.5 , with an overall spectroscopic completeness of approximately 50% .",
    "p2002 identified a sample of 88 galaxies in dynamically close pairs from the cnoc2 survey , and used these pairs to estimate the galaxy merger and accretion rates at @xmath15 .",
    "galaxy pairs were identified using separation criteria ( see   [ snapshot ] ) , and without regard to morphology .",
    "in fact , very little morphological detail is seen in the short ( @xmath6 6 minute ) mos exposures , in which atmospheric seeing blurs out most of the detail in these galaxies .",
    "p2002 argue that roughly half of these pairs are likely to be undergoing mergers .",
    "part of the evidence comes from studying identically selected galaxy pairs at low redshift , using the ssrs2 redshift survey @xcite .",
    "clear morphological signs of ongoing interactions are seen in digitized sky survey images of many of these pairs",
    ". however , it is unclear if the same systems are likely to be identified in deeper samples such as cnoc2 , in part due to increased contamination by unrelated foreground and background galaxies .",
    "moreover , while the qualitative analysis of ssrs2 pairs was intriguing , it would be preferable to quantify morphological signs of interactions in an objective and reproducible manner .      in order to address these issues , we have carried out an hst snapshot survey of dynamically close galaxy pairs from cnoc2 . our full snapshot sample consisted of all cnoc2 pairs satisfying the following two sets of criteria .",
    "first , all member galaxies were required to have apparent magnitude @xmath16 , a secure spectroscopic redshift , and absolute magnitude @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19-corrected and evolution - corrected ( @xmath20=@xmath21 ) absolute magnitude in the cousins @xmath14 filter .",
    "in addition , each pair was required to have a projected physical separation less than @xmath22 kpc , and a rest - frame relative velocity less than 500 km / s .",
    "approximately half of the pairs in this sample are likely to have true physical separations of less than @xmath22 kpc , and are therefore expected to merge within 0.5 gyr @xcite .",
    "using the preliminary cnoc2 catalogs available in advance of the hst observations ( february 1999 ) , this yielded a sample of 72 candidate galaxy pairs .",
    "cnoc2 astrometry was used to determine the position of the center of each galaxy pair , and the hst imaging was required to have the pair centred on the wf3 ccd , which is relatively free of cosmetic defects . as each targeted pair fits easily within the wf3 chip ,",
    "no restriction was imposed on the orientation of wfpc2 ( this maximizes the number of targets that can be observed in snapshot mode ) . in ",
    "[ pairsample ] , we discuss the final sample of dynamically confirmed galaxy pairs used in this study .",
    "wfpc2 snapshot observations for this program ( proposal i d 8230 ; pi patton ) were carried out between july 1999 and june 2001 . of the 72 galaxy pairs in our target list , 44 were observed . for each field , two 500-second f814w images were acquired , in order to facilitate the removal of cosmic rays .",
    "the f814w filter corresponds to rest - frame @xmath23 at the mean redshift of the sample .",
    "these images were calibrated `` on - the - fly '' as they were retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "the final images used in this analysis were downloaded from the hst archive in september 2003 , to ensure consistent and updated calibrations .",
    "each pair of images was co - added with cosmic ray rejection .",
    "object finding was then performed using sextractor @xcite , using the same source detection parameters as @xcite .",
    "particular care was taken to ensure accurate de - blending of galaxies in close proximity to one another , while avoiding the detection of substructure within individual galaxies .",
    "this was achieved by setting the sextractor deblend_mincont parameter to 0.009 .",
    "all of the object finding was inspected by eye , and confirmed to be successful for all of the bright galaxies on these images , including every galaxy used in the analysis that follows .",
    "additional preprocessing and image analysis was carried out using the galaxy image 2d ( gim2d ) software package @xcite .",
    "this iraf / spp package performs detailed bulge+disk decompositions of low signal - to - noise images of distant galaxies in a fully automated way , and has a proven track record with hst images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gim2d was used to measure a variety of structural parameters for each galaxy detected in our snapshot survey .",
    "we focus on two specific structural parameters that are best suited to revealing the structures of interest in this study .",
    "the first is the bulge fraction ( @xmath24 ) , which describes the overall structure of each galaxy .",
    "this parameter is a measure of the fraction of the galaxy light attributed to the bulge component .",
    "this quantity is determined using bulge+disk decomposition .",
    "a pure disk system has @xmath24=0 , and a pure bulge system has @xmath24=1",
    ".    the second structural parameter we employ is asymmetry , which is used to detect morphological signs of interactions that may be present .",
    "while gim2d makes several measurements of asymmetry , we choose to use @xmath25 , which is a measure of the overall smoothness of the galaxy image with respect to the bulge+disk model . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined in equation 11 of @xcite , and are the gim2d versions of the parameters originally introduced by @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are approximately equal to the total and asymmetric residual flux respectively , and are expressed as a fraction of the total galaxy flux .",
    "the discriminating power of @xmath25 , as computed by gim2d , has been demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath25 within two half light radii .",
    "this region is large enough to sample the vast majority of the asymmetric light in these systems .",
    "using a larger aperture could , in principle , increase contamination due to light from neighbouring galaxies .",
    "however , we note that the main conclusions of this study are unchanged by measuring asymmetry within three , four , or five half light radii .",
    "we conclude that this asymmetry parameter should be sensitive to the most significant morphological signs of interactions that are present in this sample .",
    "in this section , we describe the identification of a secure sample of paired galaxies found on the hst images .",
    "all 44 images were inspected visually to confirm the presence of a galaxy pair at the expected location ( the centre of the wf3 ccd ) . in one instance , a single galaxy was found ( target 64 ) . in this case , it appears that the ground - based cnoc2 survey mistakenly identified a bright region within a galaxy as a separate galaxy .",
    "in addition , revised redshift measurements in the final cnoc2 catalog led to the removal of two pairs ( targets 03 and 71 ) from the sample , as their member galaxies are no longer found to be at similar redshifts .",
    "three pairs ( targets 22 , 23 , and 43 ) were known in advance to have only a single redshift , and hence were discarded from this pairs sample . finally , given that pairs with widely differing masses are less likely to exhibit interaction - induced structural changes , a restriction of 2.5 magnitudes difference in absolute magnitude was imposed .",
    "this removed three additional pairs ( targets 02 , 62 , and 63 ) from the sample .",
    "we are left with a sample of 35 dynamically close galaxies pairs in these hst images , containing 70 paired galaxies .",
    "we note that our definition of a close companion allows for triples and higher order groupings ; however , the original snapshot sample included only one triple , and this system was not observed with hst .",
    "the basic properties of the pairs are listed in table  [ tabpairprop ] , including : hst target number , mean redshift , angular separation ( @xmath28 ) , projected physical separation ( @xmath29 ) , rest - frame relative velocity ( @xmath30 ) , and difference in absolute magnitude ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we note that some of these pairs have slightly different projected separations than reported by p2002 . due to",
    "improved angular pair separation measurements from hst imaging .",
    "wfpc2 f814w postage stamp images of the galaxies in these pairs are presented in figure  [ paired ] .",
    "table  [ tabpaired ] contain properties of these paired galaxies , including : hst i d ( hst target ; galaxy a or b ) , cnoc2 name ( patch and serial number ) , hst astrometry ( j2000 ) , spectroscopic redshift , apparent magnitude in cousins @xmath23 , and absolute magnitude in cousins @xmath23 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "additional properties given in these tables are described later in the paper .      while this snapshot survey targeted galaxy pairs , many other cnoc2 galaxies are found on these wfpc2 images .",
    "this allows for the identification of a control sample of field galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "this is an _ essential _ component of this analysis , as it enables us to determine if paired galaxies differ significantly from isolated field galaxies .",
    "we require the control sample to be chosen in precisely the same manner as paired galaxies , with the exception of the requirement of a dynamically close neighbour .",
    "of greatest importance is the availability of a spectroscopic redshift from cnoc2 , so as to ensure a fair comparison with the pair sample , and to confirm isolation .",
    "we then apply identical apparent and absolute magnitude cuts as for the paired galaxies : namely , @xmath33 and @xmath17 .",
    "these redshift catalogs were cross - correlated with the hst images , in order to identify candidates for the control sample .",
    "any galaxies lying too close to the edges of the wf chips were excluded from the analysis .",
    "in addition , a number of galaxy images were adversely affected by bad columns on the ccds , preventing accurate measurement of structural parameters ; hence they too were removed from the control sample ( note that this did not happen with any of the paired galaxies , since all pairs were centred on a clean region in the center of the wf3 chip ) .",
    "this yielded a control sample of 157 field galaxies .      as stated earlier , the primary goal of this study is to determine what effect ( if any ) the presence of a close companion has on a paired galaxy .",
    "to this end , we would ideally like to compare the paired galaxy sample with field galaxies which are certain to have no close companions .",
    "a cursory inspection of the control sample reveals that in fact many of these galaxies do appear to have relatively nearby companions . for approximately half of these companions",
    ", we can use their redshifts to determine if they are at a similar redshift or not .",
    "for the remainder , the lack of redshift information means that we can not rule them out as possible physical companions .    with this in mind",
    ", we apply several additional criteria to the control sample to ensure that all remaining galaxies are truly isolated .",
    "a neighbouring galaxy is initially considered to be a companion if it lies within a projected separation of 40 @xmath34 kpc and has an observed flux larger than 20% ( ie . , within 1.75 magnitudes ) of the host galaxy . any companion with a rest - frame relative velocity larger than 1000 km / s is discarded . every galaxy in the control sample which has no companions",
    "is then classified as isolated .",
    "these criteria yield a sample of 77 isolated galaxies .",
    "postage stamp images of these isolated galaxies are shown in figure  [ iso ] .",
    "table  [ tabiso ] contains a list of properties of these galaxies , in the same format as table  [ tabpaired ] .",
    "the redshift - absolute magnitude distributions of paired and isolated galaxies are compared in figure  [ absmag ] .",
    "overall , these samples are seen to have similar distributions . however , isolated galaxies appear to lie at slightly higher redshifts than paired galaxies .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the selection criteria imposed",
    ". optical contamination due to higher redshift interlopers is expected to be higher for galaxies at low redshift , due to the larger angular search area . as a result , it is more difficult to confirm isolation for galaxies at the low redshift end of the sample .",
    "in addition , the detection of galaxy pairs depends on the square of the selection function , meaning that pairs will be relatively rare at the high redshift end of the sample @xcite .",
    "however , the difference in mean redshift between paired and isolated galaxies is small ( 0.03 ) , and is significant only at the 1@xmath35 level .",
    "consequently , differences in the redshift distributions of paired and isolated galaxies are unlikely to cause a statistically significant difference in the structural parameters of these samples .",
    "therefore , we ignore this effect throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to measure the structural parameters of galaxies in dynamically close galaxy pairs , and to compare these measurements with those of a sample of isolated field galaxies . in the sections that follow ,",
    "we compare the distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 of paired and isolated galaxies .",
    "table  [ tabprop ] lists these and other statistical properties of paired and isolated galaxies , including the results of ks tests comparing these two samples .",
    "a histogram of @xmath24 for paired and isolated galaxies is presented in figure  [ fighistbf ] .",
    "it is immediately apparent that these samples have very similar distributions .",
    "we carry out two tests to verify this statistically .",
    "first , we compute the mean of each distribution , along with the error in the mean ( see table  [ tabprop ] ) .",
    "the means are found to be statistically identical .",
    "next , we perform a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test on the two distributions , in which the k - s probability indicates the significance level for the hypothesis that two samples are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "a small significance level indicates that two distributions have significantly different cumulative distribution functions . for the @xmath24 distributions of paired and isolated galaxies",
    ", we find a ks probability of 95% , indicating that we do not detect any statistical difference in the samples .",
    "therefore , we conclude that paired and isolated galaxies have statistically equivalent distributions of @xmath24 .      a histogram of @xmath25 for paired and isolated galaxies is presented in figure  [ fighista ] .",
    "these distributions appear to differ substantially , particularly in the high asymmetry regime , where a noticeable tail is seen in the distribution of paired galaxies .",
    "this is precisely the regime in which one might expect interacting galaxies to be more prevalent .",
    "table  [ tabprop ] shows that the mean @xmath25 of paired galaxies is larger than that of isolated galaxies , and the difference is significant at the 1.8@xmath35 level .",
    "the results of the k - s test confirm this , with a k - s probability of only 16% .",
    "we conclude that a subset of the paired galaxies are significantly more asymmetric than isolated galaxies .      in order to better understand these correlations",
    ", we investigate the relationship between bulge fraction and asymmetry for paired and isolated galaxies .",
    "figure  [ figbfrtra1 ] exhibits several interesting trends .",
    "first , for isolated galaxies , there is a small monotonic decrease in asymmetry as bulge fraction increases .",
    "the locus of this distribution is similar to that found using galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , using identical gim2d parameters ( simard 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "this trend is also seen for paired galaxies , though there is much more scatter in the distribution of asymmetries .",
    "overall , paired galaxies appear to have larger asymmetries than isolated galaxies , particularly for low bulge fractions .",
    "the most asymmetric paired galaxies ( @xmath36 ) all have low bulge fractions ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we will investigate the significance of these trends further in ",
    "[ asymfrac ] .",
    "one possible explanation for the differences seen between paired and isolated galaxies is a bias in the measurement of structural parameters for galaxies which are crowded closely together on the sky .",
    "that is , in attempting to measure structural parameters ( especially asymmetry ) of a given galaxy , it is possible that the measurements may be adversely affected by the presence of a nearby galaxy . in particular",
    ", asymmetry measurements could be compromised if the light from a neighbouring galaxy contributes unequal and significant amounts of light to opposite sides of the galaxy in question .",
    "if true , we would expect to see significant trends in observed structural parameters with angular separation of the two galaxies .",
    "if this bias is completely responsible for the observed differences between paired and isolated galaxies , we would expect the anomalous paired galaxies to be found preferentially at small angular separations . to investigate this possibility , we plot the structural parameters of paired galaxies versus the angular separation , in figure  [ figtheta ] .",
    "no significant dependence on @xmath28 is seen in this figure . in particular ,",
    "galaxies with large asymmetries and large bulge fractions are seen at a wide range of angular separations .",
    "this supports the assumption that nearby companions do not cause a significant bias in the measurement of structural parameters .",
    "therefore , we ignore this effect throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "our sample of galaxy pairs spans a small range in both projected separation ( @xmath29 ) and line of sight velocity difference ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we now explore the possibility that the structural parameters depend on this separation .",
    "measured structural parameters are plotted versus @xmath29 and @xmath30 in figures  [ figrp ] and [ figdelv ] respectively .",
    "no obvious trend is observed . in particular ,",
    "galaxies with relative large asymmetries and bulge fractions are found over the full range of parameter space explored : namely , @xmath38 kpc @xmath39 kpc and @xmath40 km / s .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , given the limited sample size and the relatively small range of pair separations available .",
    "moreover , the use of projected separation ( rather than three - dimensional separation ) weakens any existing correlation between pair separation and galaxy properties . with a sample spanning greater pair separations ,",
    "however , one might well expect to see a stronger dependence of structural properties on pair separation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , one might expect structural properties to depend on the relative mass of the galaxies in merging pairs .",
    "in particular , equal mass pairs ( major mergers ) might be expected to exhibit stronger signs of interactions than pairs with significantly difference masses ( minor mergers ) .",
    "we use the difference in absolute magnitude @xmath18 ( hereafter @xmath31 ) as our best indicator of this ratio .",
    "the maximum @xmath31 in our sample is 2.5 ( see   [ pairsample ] ) , corresponding to a 1:10 ratio in luminosity .",
    "structural properties are plotted versus @xmath31 in figure  [ figdelm ] .",
    "once again , no strong correlation is seen .",
    "this indicates that any merger - induced changes in morphology are seen throughout the full range of mass ratios probed by our sample .",
    "one of the primary goals of this study is to determine whether , and how often , paired galaxies exhibit morphological signs of interactions . to this end",
    ", we investigate the fraction of galaxies with measured asymmetry in excess of a given threshold .",
    "this approach has been used by @xcite to estimate the fraction of galaxies undergoing mergers .",
    "we begin by selecting an asymmetry threshold that is likely to distinguish between normal galaxies and those with morphological signs of interactions . despite the objective and quantitative nature of these asymmetry measurements ,",
    "the choice of a threshold is somewhat subjective .",
    "images of all of the galaxies in both the paired and isolated samples were inspected by eye , to ascertain whether or not the asymmetries seen were substantial .",
    "a threshold of @xmath41 was found to be the best threshold for separating symmetric and asymmetric galaxies .",
    "hereafter , we refer to all galaxies which have @xmath1 as being `` asymmetric '' .",
    "this is slightly less strict than the threshold of @xmath42 used by @xcite .    using this definition",
    ", we find that @xmath43 of paired galaxies are asymmetric , compared with @xmath44 of isolated galaxies .",
    "that is , we find that paired galaxies are nearly three times more likely to be classified as asymmetric , and the difference between these samples is significant at the 1.8@xmath35 level .",
    "a comparison of asymmetry fractions using other choices of thresholds can be seen in the lower panel of figure  [ figfpfi ] .",
    "this plot reveals a statistically significant difference between the asymmetry fractions of paired and isolated galaxies for a wide range of asymmetry thresholds , strengthening this conclusion .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that not all galaxies in the paired sample are likely to be undergoing interactions or mergers . instead",
    ", the separation criteria used to identify galaxy pairs are less than perfect at choosing merging pairs , due mainly to the contribution of peculiar velocities to the line - of - sight separation of the galaxies in a given pair . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "some of the dynamical galaxy pairs identified with these criteria are likely to have true physical separations that are so large that the system will never merge .",
    "the fraction of pairs that are likely to have true three - dimensional physical separations of less than 20 @xmath34 kpc has been estimated to be @xmath45 @xcite . while this estimate is approximate in nature , it is greatly preferable to assuming that all of the paired galaxies in our study are close enough to merge .    with this assumption , we infer that our sample of paired galaxies is made up of equal parts isolated galaxies and merging galaxies . using this approach , we find that @xmath46 of merging galaxies are asymmetric .",
    "this is 4.3 times larger than the asymmetry fraction of isolated galaxies . in the upper panel of figure  [ figfpfi ] ,",
    "the asymmetry fraction of merging and isolated galaxies is plotted over a wide range in asymmetry thresholds .",
    "this figure shows that the difference between the two samples is striking , and is not confined to our specific choice of asymmetry threshold .",
    "we note also that this result has implications for the k - s test applied to the paired and isolated samples in   [ asym ] ; that is , the k - s probability of 16% is almost certainly too high , due to the mixture of merging and isolated galaxies in the paired sample .",
    "we conclude that merging galaxies are significantly more asymmetric than isolated galaxies .    finally ,",
    "we repeat this analysis using a stricter asymmetry threshold . visual inspection of the images indicates that galaxies with @xmath3 may be described as `` strongly asymmetric '' . with this definition ,",
    "we find that @xmath47 of isolated galaxies are strongly asymmetric , @xmath48 of paired galaxies are strongly asymmetric , and @xmath49 of merging galaxies are strongly asymmetric . clearly , the difference between the samples is even more striking when the most strongly asymmetric galaxies are considered .",
    "historically , there have been many attempts to detect enhanced star formation in merging galaxies ( e.g. , larson & tinsley 1978 ) . optical colors of galaxies are known to be useful , though imperfect , indicators of their underlying stellar populations and star - forming histories .",
    "the hst imaging used in this study are in a single passband ( f814w ) only ; however , we do have integrated color measurements from the cnoc2 survey @xcite .",
    "rest - frame colors were computed by fitting model spectral energy distributions to the cnoc2 photometry ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we limit our analysis to rest - frame @xmath4 color , hereafter @xmath5 .",
    "the mean colors and cumulative distributions of paired and isolated galaxies are found to be statistically equivalent ( see table  [ tabprop ] ) .",
    "we now investigate the connection between rest - frame colors and structural parameters .",
    "figure  [ figbr0bf ] contains a plot of rest - frame color versus bulge fraction , for paired and isolated galaxies .",
    "a clear correlation is seen for isolated galaxies , in that galaxies with larger bulge fractions are redder .",
    "this result is consistent with numerous studies of the properties of field galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a similar correlation is seen for paired galaxies , though there is significantly more scatter in color .",
    "disk - dominated ( @xmath51 ) paired galaxies have the same mean color as their isolated counterparts , whereas bulge - dominated paired galaxies are bluer ( at the 1.3@xmath35 level ) . if we instead treat bulge fraction as the dependent variable , we find that the bluest paired galaxies ( @xmath52 ) have higher bulge fractions than the bluest isolated galaxies ( significant at 1.5@xmath35 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with a scenario in which mergers have induced central starbursts in some paired galaxies , making them bluer and/or boosting their measured bulge fractions .    in figure  [ figbr0a ] ,",
    "rest - frame color is plotted versus asymmetry .",
    "isolated galaxies exhibit a gradual trend towards larger asymmetry for bluer galaxies , consistent with the color - asymmetry relationship reported by @xcite for the frei et al .",
    "sample of ( non - merging ) nearby galaxies .",
    "the mean colors of paired and isolated galaxies are statistically equivalent for systems classified as symmetric ( @xmath53 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the seven most asymmetric galaxies are all paired , and are very blue ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these galaxies lie in a location on the color - asymmetry plot similar to that of the merger / interaction induced starburst galaxies of @xcite .",
    "it appears , therefore , that the sample of paired galaxies identified in our study is made up of two subsets : symmetric galaxies with colors identical to isolated galaxies , and asymmetric galaxies with relatively blue colors which have no counterparts in the isolated sample .",
    "an independent measure of current star formation can be obtained from the strength of emission line fluxes . the primary emission line detected in the cnoc2 survey",
    "@xcite is [ oii]3727 .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width of this line , denoted ew([oii ] ) , was measured for most of the galaxies of interest in this hst study .",
    "negative ew([oii ] refers to emission .",
    "strong [ oii ] emission is generally associated with current star formation activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the mean ew([oii ] )",
    "is more negative for paired galaxies than isolated galaxies , though the difference is relatively small ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "a k - s test indicates significant differences between the parent distributions .",
    "this difference in cumulative distributions appears to originate in the strong emission line regime .",
    "in particular , for galaxies with ew([oii ] ) @xmath56 , paired galaxies outnumber isolated galaxies two to one , despite a slightly smaller sample of paired galaxies versus isolated galaxies .",
    "these conclusions are similar to those of @xcite , who compared the spectrophotometric properties of merging and isolated galaxies at low redshift .    in order to see how emission line strength relates to structural parameters , we plot ew([oii ] ) versus bulge fraction ( figure  [ figeqwbf ] ) and asymmetry ( figure  [ figeqwa ] ) , for both paired and isolated galaxies .",
    "while isolated and paired galaxies both exhibit a general trend towards stronger [ oii ] emission with smaller bulge fraction , paired galaxies are seen to have emission that is stronger than isolated galaxies of the same bulge fraction .",
    "figure  [ figeqwa ] shows that the subset of paired galaxies which are asymmetric exhibit strong [ oii ] emission .",
    "in addition , direct comparison of colors and emission lines for individual galaxies reveals that , for the sample of 8 strongly asymmetric paired galaxies in figure  [ figbr0a ] , 4/4 galaxies with emission line measurements have strong emission ( ew([oii ] ) @xmath57 ) .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with the conclusions of the previous section .",
    "in   [ asymfrac ] , we estimated that roughly 40% of galaxies in merging pairs are asymmetric , and 25% are strongly asymmetric . while these fractions are much higher than the equivalent measurements for isolated galaxies , it is worth investigating if these results are consistent with our hypothesis that the galaxies in our `` merging pair '' sample are in fact undergoing mergers at the present time .",
    "if true , what fraction of these galaxies would be expected to exhibit significant asymmetries ?",
    "there are several reasons why this fraction is likely to be substantially less than 100% .",
    "first , even if these pairs are likely to merge soon , some may be too early in the merging process for strong asymmetries to have been produced . also , some galaxies ( early types in particular ) are less likely to exhibit signs of asymmetries than others . finally , the details of the orbits and galaxy rotations affect the resulting asymmetries .",
    "it is therefore difficult to predict in advance what the asymmetry fraction should be .",
    "we can , however , compare with other observations . @xcite studied a sample of 66 ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg s ) , whose infrared emissions",
    "are thought to have been triggered by strong interactions or mergers of gas - rich spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "their sample would be expected to exhibit stronger asymmetries than virtually any other sample of galaxies , including the close pairs targeted in this study .",
    "they found that approximately 50% of ulirgs have asymmetries consistent with being involved in ongoing major mergers .",
    "they speculate that the remaining 50% of their sample is composed of systems that are in either the beginning or the end stages of the merger event , when asymmetry is not expected to be strong . given this result ,",
    "we conclude that our asymmetry fractions for close galaxy pairs are broadly consistent with the hypothesis of p2002 that approximately 50% of the dynamical pairs identified in this study are currently undergoing mergers .",
    "one of the primary goals of modern day cosmology is the determination of the star formation history of the universe .",
    "numerous studies , beginning with @xcite and @xcite , have shown that the cosmic star formation rate has decreased by an order of magnitude since @xmath58 .",
    "a compilation by hogg ( 2001 ) indicates that the star formation rate evolves as @xmath59 over this redshift range .",
    "it is as yet unclear what is driving this change in star formation rate .",
    "one obvious candidate is galaxy mergers , since mergers are known to trigger the formation of new stars in at least some merging systems .",
    "moreover , the merger rate appears to increase with redshift , at a level similar to the increase in the cosmic star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at low redshift ,",
    "there have been several recent studies in which a clear enhancement in star formation is seen in pairs separated by less than 20 @xmath34 kpc @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the results have been less conclusive , primarily due to the increased difficulty of identifying dynamically close galaxy pairs ( e.g. , zepf & koo 1989 ; carlberg , pritchet , & infante 1994 ) . using a sample of thirteen dynamical pairs at @xmath60",
    ", @xcite found that four of these pairs contain galaxies with strong [ oii ] emission , very blue colors , and low relative velocities .",
    "while their ground - based images were of marginal quality , some indications of morphological asymmetry were seen in these four pairs .    in ",
    "[ sf ] , we found that paired galaxies have different distributions of rest - frame color and emission line strengths than isolated galaxies .",
    "in particular , the most asymmetric galaxies have unusually blue colors and strong emission lines , and are found almost exclusively in pairs .",
    "these results are consistent with a scenario in which merging has induced star formation in a subset of the pair sample . however , many of the remaining paired galaxies have colors and emission line strengths consistent with isolated galaxies .",
    "this is hardly surprising , given that the timescale of induced star formation is likely to be considerably shorter than the merging timescale ( cf .",
    "moreover , as outlined in   [ asymfrac ] , our sample of dynamical pairs is likely to be a roughly equal mix of merging and non - merging pairs .",
    "as our sample of isolated galaxies contains very few asymmetric galaxies , we infer that most of the asymmetric galaxies in the paired sample are found in merging pairs .",
    "we interpret this as evidence of induced star formation occurring in a significant fraction of merging galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "we have arrived at this conclusion using a sample containing three times as many dynamical pairs as the @xcite sample , and for which we have made quantitative measurements of asymmetry using high resolution hst imaging .      in ",
    "[ bulgefraction ] , we demonstrated that the bulge fraction distributions of paired and isolated galaxies are identical .",
    "one possible interpretation of this result is that galaxies of all morphological types have equal probabilities of being involved in these early - stage mergers , and that their bulge fractions are not significantly altered by the interaction until later in the merging process .",
    "however , if these early stage mergers have triggered star formation , as we have argued , one might expect this extra star formation to occur primarily in the nuclei , as predicted by simulations ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "if so , some paired galaxies might be expected to have boosted @xmath24 values , since bulge+disk decompositions can not easily distinguish between a bona fide bulge and a nuclear starburst . we would therefore have to conclude that , on average , paired galaxies have lower bulge fractions than isolated galaxies .",
    "we are unable to distinguish between these two scenarios with these data . however , in a study of the nuclear morphology in the toomre sequence of merging galaxies , @xcite find no evidence of elevated nuclear emission , except in the latest stage merging systems .",
    "this implies that nuclear star formation may not be a significant factor in our pair sample .",
    "using hst imaging of cnoc2 galaxies at @xmath11 , we have found clear differences in the structural properties of paired and isolated galaxies .",
    "while the distribution of bulge fractions are found to be indistinguishable , striking differences are seen in their asymmetries .",
    "assuming that half of our dynamical pairs are unlikely to be close enough to merge , we estimate that 40% @xmath2 11% of merging galaxies are asymmetric , compared with 9% @xmath2 3% of isolated galaxies .",
    "this difference is even more pronounced when considering strongly asymmetric galaxies ( 25% @xmath2 8% for merging galaxies versus 1% @xmath2 1% for isolated galaxies ) .",
    "these results imply that many of the dynamically close galaxy pairs identified by p2002 are in fact merging , and provide further support for the use of close dynamical pairs in estimating the galaxy merger rate and its evolution with redshift .",
    "moreover , these results demonstrate for the first time that there is considerable overlap between the two most common methods of estimating the galaxy merger rate : namely , morphological merger fractions and close pair statistics .",
    "we also find clear evidence for a connection between asymmetry and star forming properties in galaxy pairs at intermediate redshift .",
    "strongly asymmetric paired galaxies are found to be very blue , with rest - frame colors in the range @xmath61 , compared with a mean color of @xmath62 for all paired galaxies .",
    "in addition , asymmetric galaxies in pairs have strong [ oii]3727  emission lines . within our sample of 35 galaxy pairs ,",
    "15 pairs contain at least one asymmetric galaxy , and at least 70% of the asymmetric galaxies in these pairs show signs of enhanced star formation .",
    "we conclude that close to half of the galaxy pairs in our sample are in the process of merging , and that the majority of these merging events are accompanied by triggered star formation .",
    "when combined with the observed rise in the galaxy merger rate with redshift , the detection of enhanced star formation in many of these systems implies that mergers are at least partially responsible for the rise in the cosmic star formation rate with redshift .",
