    "the nature and origin of the dusty obscuring torus believed to surround active galactic nuclei ( agns ) - whether it is inflowing , outflowing , and its relation to star formation - are important for our understanding of the evolution of agn , and how they affect their environment ( ` feedback ' ) .",
    "however , the nature of the torus is problematic because direct observations are rare .",
    "recently , rose , elvis & tadhunter ( 2015 ; ret15 hereinafter ) introduced the coronal line forest active galactic nuclei ( clif agn ) .",
    "the optical spectra of clif agn are remarkable . as well as typical low ionization agn emission lines ( flils ; e.g. [ oiii ] , [ oii ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] ) and balmer recombination lines ( e.g. h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 ) ,",
    "their spectra include dozens of strong forbidden high ionization emission lines ( fhils ; e.g. [ fevii ] , [ fex ] , [ nev ] and [ arv ] ) .",
    "ret15 define the boundary between low and high ionization to be the ionization potential ( i@xmath6 ) of the heii edge at 54.4 ev .",
    "six out of seven of the clif agn in ret15 lacked broad emission lines ( fwhm h@xmath5 @xmath7 2000",
    "km s@xmath8 ) , i.e. they are type 2 agn , and so are likely observed with our line of sight at a relatively large inclination angle to the torus axis . the far wall of the torus is a plausible source for the fhils which will be strongest if we have a maximal view of the inner wall ( nagao et al .",
    "2001 ; rose et al .",
    "the coronal line region ( clr ) lies at a distance comparable to the hot dust sublimation radius ( ret15 ) . ret15",
    "use photoionization modelling results ( cloudy ; ferland 1998 ) to calculate the clr radial distances for the clif agn and find that they are comparable to the dust grain sublimation distances , thus supporting this view .",
    "if this picture proves correct , then the geometry of these agns is unusually well - constrained , making them laboratories to test agn torus models .",
    "fischer et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have recently shown that the spitzer mid - ir ( f@xmath9/f@xmath10 ) colours change smoothly with the agn inclination angle derived from kinematic models of agn bi - cones .",
    "crenshaw et al .",
    "( in prep . ) confirmed this trend using wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) mid - ir colours [ w2-w4 ] ( 4.6@xmath0m-22@xmath0 m ) .",
    "this result allows us to use [ w2-w4 ] as a proxy for inclination and so test whether clif agn have the special orientation suggested by ret15 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : ksw24 ]",
    "assuming that the overall differences in [ w2-w4 ] for the agn studied in figure [ fig : w24 ] are dominated by the inclination angle ( figure [ fig:24 ] ) , and not by selection effects , the [ w2-w4 ] colours imply that type 2 clif agn lie at an intermediate inclination angle when compared to the samples of sdss type 1 and type 2 agn .",
    "this relatively large angle to the torus axis may well provide us with a maximal view of the far wall of the torus , while the agn continuum is still obscured by the near side of the torus , as suggested by ret15 .",
    "type 2 clif agn may be useful for our understanding of agn unification .",
    "it is instructive to see where the new type 1 clif agn line in [ w2-w4 ] colour space . in figure",
    "[ fig : w24b ] we plot normalised histograms showing the [ w2-w4 ] colours for the sdss type 1 agn sample ( @xcite ; blue dotted line ) and type 1 clif agn ( rose et al .",
    "2015 , in prep ; green solid line ) .",
    "the [ w2-w4 ] colours for the typical type 1 agn and type 1 clif agn are indistinguishable ( p - value = 0.22 ; table [ tab : ksw24 ] ) .",
    "this is supported by the median values presented in table [ tab : w24med ] as the median [ w2-w4 ] ( and therefore agn - torus inclinations ) agree within two error bars .",
    "a ks test comparing [ w2-w4 ] for these samples ( table [ tab : ksw24 ] ) supports the view that there is no difference in their [ w2-w4 ] colours .",
    "all the type 1 clif agn were selected from the quasar catalog , therefore these comparisons are not biased by selection effects . in addition , there is no overlap between the samples .",
    "the lack of significant differences between the [ w2-w4 ] colours of the type 1 clif agn and the sdss type 1 agn implies that the type 1 clif agn have no special inclination when compared to typical type 1 agn .",
    "type 1 clif agn are therefore distinct from type 2 clif agn .",
    "their strong clr must then be due to another distinct mechanism .",
    "we will study both these populations of clif agn in further papers in the following ways .",
    "1 .   model the inner torus wall geometry proposed to produce strong fhils ( glidden et al .",
    "2015 , in prep . ) .",
    "2 .   determine the physical conditions ( ionization parameter and electron density ) of the clr , and estimate the radial distances to this region ( rose et al .",
    "2015 , in prep . ) .",
    "in the longer term it would clearly be extremely valuable to obtain high spatial resolution spectroscopy for the clif agn , so that the agn - torus inclination of type 2 clif agn can be estimated using the nlr bicones @xcite .",
