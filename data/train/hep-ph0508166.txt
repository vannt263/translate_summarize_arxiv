    "the @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) one - loop structure has been considerably studied in the literature not just because it may constitute a mechanism through which physics beyond the fermi scale may show up , but also due to some theoretical issues concerning its dependence on the gauge - fixing scheme .",
    "it turns out that the conventional gauge - fixing procedures give rise to ill - behaved off - shell green functions that may display inadequate properties such as a nontrivial dependence on the gauge - fixing parameter , an increase larger than the one observed in physical amplitudes at high energies , and the appearance of unphysical thresholds .",
    "the on - shell green functions can represent physical amplitudes as they are independent on the gauge - fixing procedure , such as occurs with the static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath7 boson @xcite , but gauge independence is lost if at least one external particle becomes virtual .",
    "although off - shell green functions are generally gauge dependent , the @xmath8-matrix elements to which they contribute must be gauge independent .",
    "this is the case of the off - shell @xmath0 vertex , which is just a piece of some physical process such as the @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions .",
    "nonetheless , it would be interesting if one was able to study the sensitivity to radiative corrections of the @xmath0 coupling , and other sm couplings as well , without invoking some particular @xmath8-matrix element .",
    "the concepts of gauge invariance and gauge independence are two essential ingredients of gauge systems , though the former is not necessarily present at the quantum level .",
    "while gauge invariance plays a central role when defining the classical action of the system , once the latter is quantized one must invariably invoke an appropriate gauge - fixing procedure to define a nondegenerate action , which means that gauge invariance is to be broken explicitly .",
    "the resultant action is not gauge invariant , though it is invariant under brst symmetry @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the green functions derived from this action can not satisfy simple ( qed - like ) ward identities , but they do satisfy more elaborate slavnov - taylor identities that are dictated by brst symmetry . also , green functions contain much unphysical information that is removed provided a physical observable is considered .",
    "contrary to green functions , which are highly dependent on the gauge - fixing procedure , physical amplitudes have no such dependence , thereby being gauge independent .",
    "there are thus some subtle mechanisms that conspire to produce nontrivial cancelations between the green functions defining a physical observable .",
    "it is clear that a nonconventional quantization scheme must be applied in order to generate gauge - invariant green functions , which in turn can be obtained from a gauge - invariant quantum action @xmath11 . in this respect ,",
    "the background - field - method ( bfm ) @xcite is meant to construct manifest gauge - invariant quantum actions from which well - behaved green functions satisfying simple ward identities can be derived .",
    "this method , implemented at the level of generating functionals , relies on the decomposition of the gauge fields into two parts : the quantum field @xmath12 and the background ( classical ) field @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 . in the generating functional only the quantum fields are integrated out , whereas the background fields are treated as sources .",
    "this means that only the quantum fields can circulate inside the loops .",
    "this method allows one to introduce a gauge - fixing procedure for the quantum fields without spoiling the gauge invariance of the quantum action with respect to the classical fields .",
    "although it is necessary to define a gauge - fixing procedure for both the quantum and the classical fields in order to define @xmath8-matrix elements , only a gauge - fixing scheme for the quantum gauge fields is required to define general off - shell green functions .",
    "the quantum action is invariant under ordinary gauge transformations of the classical fields , while the quantum fields transform as the adjoint representation of the group in consideration . in other words ,",
    "the so constructed action @xmath15 $ ] is degenerate with respect to the background fields but nondegenerate with respect to the quantum fields .",
    "the green functions derived from the quantum action @xmath16 $ ] are gauge invariant in the sense that they satisfy simple ward identities , but it is worth stressing that they are still dependent on the gauge parameter @xmath17 that characterizes the gauge - fixing scheme used for the quantum fields , and so there is no gauge independence . the bfm has proved useful in many applications @xcite , simplifying both technically and conceptually the calculation of radiative corrections .",
    "as already mentioned , green functions arising from a conventional quantum action ( a brst - invariant but gauge - noninvariant one ) contain a lot of unphysical information that is removed once they are inserted into some physical observable .",
    "some of this unwanted information can be removed at the level of the generating functional through the bfm formalism , which allows one to construct a gauge - invariant quantum action from which gauge - invariant green functions can be obtained .",
    "although the resultant green functions satisfy simple ward identities , they are not gauge independent .",
    "thus far there is still no known mechanism yielding both gauge - invariant and gauge - independent green functions directly from the generating functional , although there is already a diagrammatic method meant for this purpose , the so - called pinch technique ( pt ) @xcite .",
    "this method relies on constructing well - behaved green functions by combining some individual contributions from self - energies , vertex , and box diagrams , which usually appear in physical processes . in general , the feynman rules used in this diagrammatic approach are derived from a conventional effective action , though those derived from the bfm have also been used for a deeper study of the method self - consistence @xcite .",
    "although the pt was first introduced for the study of pure yang - mills theories at the one - loop level @xcite , it has already been applied to theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) @xcite , including the study of self - energies @xcite and trilinear vertices @xcite involving the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "a complete calculation of the one - loop contribution to the @xmath0 vertex from the electroweak bosons was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite : it was intended to show that the vertex functions satisfy a simple ward identity , which establishes a relationship between this vertex and the @xmath7 self - energy . more specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite discusses the gauge independence of the form factors associated with the @xmath18 vertex for off - shell photon and on - shell @xmath7 bosons .",
    "afterwards , an important connection between the pt and the bfm was established @xcite at the one - loop level by showing that the green functions calculated via the bfm feynman rules coincide with those obtained through the pt for the specific value @xmath19 .",
    "more recently , the pt was extended to the two - loop level in the context of both the yang - mills @xcite and the electroweak sectors @xcite , and the one - loop connection to the bfm was established too .",
    "a step toward a nondiagrammatic formulation of the pt via the powerful batalin - vilkovisky quantization method @xcite was presented in ref .",
    "this framework was used to generalize the pt at any order of perturbation theory @xcite , and it was meant to show that the link between the pt green functions and those obtained via the bfm along with the feynman - thooft gauge remains at all orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a link remains a puzzle , though it is worth noting that the feynman - thooft gauge yields no unphysical thresholds .",
    "establishing such a connection at any order of perturbation theory is very important for practical purposes because one can simply use the bfm feynman - thooft gauge ( bfmfg ) to calculate gauge - independent off - shell amplitudes , which happens to be much less cumbersome than the use of the pt .",
    "although in conventional quantization schemes the quantum action of the theory is not gauge invariant , it is still possible to introduce gauge invariance with respect to a subgroup of such a theory .",
    "this scheme is particulary useful when the quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields associated with this subgroup are deemed negligible .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to assess the virtual effects of the heavy physics lying beyond the fermi scale on the sm green functions in a @xmath3-covariant manner , in which case it is only necessary to introduce a quantization scheme for the heavy fields since the sm fields would only appear as external legs .",
    "this is indeed the philosophy behind the effective lagrangian approach widely used in the context of the electroweak theory , where it is assumed that the new physics effects must respect the @xmath3 symmetry . in a specific theory beyond the sm",
    ", a @xmath3-invariant effective lagrangian can be constructed by introducing a @xmath3-covariant gauge - fixing procedure for the heavy gauge bosons in order to integrate them out in the generating functional . in analogy with the bfm , the gauge - fixing procedure for the heavy gauge fields must involve the @xmath3-covariant derivative given in the representation in which the heavy fields transform under this group .",
    "this is the reason why such gauges , which were first introduced by fujikawa in the context of the sm @xcite , are called nonlinear or covariant gauges . in this case , the @xmath7 propagator is defined in a covariant way under the electromagnetic @xmath20 group , so the vertex functions associated with the @xmath18 interaction and the @xmath7 self - energy satisfy a simple ward identity .",
    "the most general renormalizable structure of this gauge - fixing procedure has been discussed from the brst - symmetry standpoint in @xcite , and a discussion about the difficulties on implementing the faddeev - popov method ( fpm ) has been presented too @xcite .",
    "this gauge - fixing procedure has proved a valuable tool in radiative corrections as it simplifies considerably the loop calculations @xcite .",
    "the method has also been used to quantize yang - mills theories without ssb @xcite .",
    "we will show below that , within some specific models , it is possible to use a nonlinear gauge to parametrize in an @xmath3-invariant way the impact of new physics on the sm green functions . in particular , we will show that it is possible to use this class of gauges to estimate the one - loop effects of new heavy gauge bosons on the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "we are interested in the sensitivity of the @xmath0 vertex to the new heavy gauge bosons predicted by the so - called minimal @xmath21 model @xcite , which is based on the @xmath22 gauge group .",
    "apart from predicting signals of new physics at the tev scale , this model introduces unique features that have been the focus of great interest recently @xcite such as a possible approach to the solution of the family replication problem . in this model",
    ", the lepton spectrum is the same as the sm one , but it is accommodated in @xmath23 antitriplets ; the quark sector is also arranged in the fundamental representation of this group , which requires the introduction of three new quarks . in order to endow all the particles with mass , a higgs sector composed by three triplets and one sextet of @xmath23 is required , though only one of the triplets is needed to break down @xmath24 into @xmath3 at the new physics scale @xmath25 . in the first stage of ssb , there emerge singly and doubly charged gauge bosons in a doublet of the @xmath26 group , as well as a new neutral boson @xmath27 .",
    "the new charged gauge bosons were dubbed bileptons because they carry two units of lepton number .",
    "the three exotic quarks and a cp even higgs boson do not couple to the @xmath7 gauge boson since they emerge as singlets of @xmath26 , and get their mass at the @xmath28 scale . thus , at this scale , the @xmath18 and @xmath29 vertices can only receive contributions from the bileptons .",
    "the fact that the @xmath26 group is totally embedded in @xmath23 gives rise to unusual couplings between the bileptons and the sm gauge fields , which arise via the electroweak covariant derivative since the bileptons transform as the fundamental representation of @xmath26 .",
    "it turns out that these couplings do not involve any mixing angle and are similar both in strength and lorentz structure to those couplings existing between the sm gauge bosons themselves , as opposed to the gauge bosons appearing in other sm extensions .",
    "our main goal is to estimate , in a @xmath3-invariant way , the sensitivity of the @xmath0 vertex to the bileptons . to this end",
    ", we introduce a @xmath3-covariant gauge - fixing procedure for the bileptons , which leads to an invariant quantum action .",
    "we will show below that the resulting @xmath18 and @xmath29 green functions are gauge invariant and satisfy simple ward identities .",
    "another feature worthwhile to emphasize is that the fpm fails when it is attempted to be used in conjunction with this class of gauges : the resultant theory is not renormalizable @xcite .",
    "instead of using this method , we will present a discussion based on brst symmetry @xcite , which is a powerful formalism adequate not only to quantize yang - mills theories with broader gauge - fixing procedures , as the nonlinear ones , but also to quantize more general gauge systems . as we will see below",
    ", our quantization scheme incorporates the main ingredient of the bfm , namely , the gauge invariance of the quantum action , which turns loop calculations into a somewhat simple task .",
    "the rest of the paper has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] a brief description of the minimal @xmath21 model is presented .",
    "particular emphasis is given to the yang - mills sector .",
    "[ gauge ] a @xmath3-covariant gauge - fixing procedure for the bileptons is presented along with a discussion on the advantages of using the brst formalism instead of the fpm .",
    "[ cal ] is devoted to present the one - loop amplitudes for the @xmath18 and @xmath29 vertices , whereas in secs .",
    "[ dis ] and [ con ] we discuss our results and present the conclusions .",
    "the @xmath30 model has been discussed to some extent in the literature @xcite .",
    "we will only focus on those features that are relevant for the present discussion .",
    "in particular , we will concentrate on the first stage of ssb , when the @xmath21 group is broken down into the sm group .",
    "the complete higgs sector is comprised by three triplets and one sextet of @xmath23 , but only the following triplet is necessary to break @xmath2 into @xmath3 :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a doublet of @xmath3 with hypercharge 3 .    in the fundamental representation of @xmath2 , the covariant derivative can be written as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 @xmath35 are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath36 .",
    "the generators are normalized as @xmath37 . when @xmath38 develops a vacuum expectation value , @xmath39 , the exotic quarks , one physical neutral scalar , and the new gauge bosons acquire masses , whereas the remaining scalar multiplets give mass to the sm particles .",
    "the first stage of ssb is accomplished by @xmath40 according to the following scheme : six generators are broken ( @xmath41 for @xmath42 ) and the remaining ones leave invariant the vacuum ( @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath45 , so the hypercharge can be identified with the following linear combination of broken generators : @xmath46 . at this stage of ssb",
    "there appear one single charged bilepton and one doubly charged one defined by    @xmath47    which have the following mass @xmath48 according to the quantum number assignment , these fields accommodate in one doublet of @xmath3 with hypercharge 3 :    @xmath49    as far as the scalar triplet is concerned , the two components of the @xmath3 doublet with hypercharge 3 , @xmath32 , coincide with the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the bilepton doublet : @xmath50 finally , the third component of the triplet contains the physical higgs boson and the pseudo - goldstone boson associated with @xmath27 : @xmath51    the bilepton masses receive new contributions at the fermi scale , when @xmath3 is broken into @xmath20 , which yields an upper bound on the splitting between the square bilepton masses : @xmath52 therefore , @xmath53 and @xmath54 can not not be very different : one of them can not become arbitrarily large while the other one remains fixed .",
    "in fact , the bilepton masses become nearly degenerate when they are much larger than @xmath55 . in addition , the theoretical constraint @xmath56 obtained from matching the gauge couplings constants at the @xmath2 breaking scale yields an upper bound on the bilepton masses of the order of 1 tev @xcite . therefore , our estimate for the green functions associated with the @xmath0 vertex at the @xmath28 scale would not become spoiled by the new contributions arising at the @xmath57 scale . as far as the remaining gauge bosons are concerned , the gauge fields @xmath58 and @xmath59 mix to produce a massive field @xmath60 , and a massless gauge boson @xmath61@xcite .",
    "the latter is associated with the @xmath62 group . at the @xmath28 scale ,",
    "the @xmath27 field does not couple with the @xmath7 boson , though it can couple to a @xmath7 boson pair at the fermi scale via @xmath63 mixing @xcite .",
    "therefore , although five massive gauge bosons emerge at the @xmath28 scale , along with three exotic quarks and one higgs boson , only the bileptons couple to the @xmath7 gauge boson .",
    "these interactions are dictated by the @xmath3 symmetry , and emerge entirely from the yang - mills sector associated with the @xmath64 group .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is composed of the following three @xmath3-invariant pieces",
    "@xcite :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the electroweak yang - mills lagrangian :    @xmath67    where we have made the association @xmath68 , for @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath69 encompasses the interactions between the sm gauge bosons and the new ones , it can be written as    @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have introduced the definitions @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , @xmath73 stands for the covariant derivative associated with the electroweak group .",
    "the first two terms of this lagrangian induce a diversity of couplings between the sm gauge bosons and the bileptons .",
    "finally , the term @xmath74 induces the interactions between the @xmath27 boson and the bileptons :    @xmath75    note that each term in the last two lagrangians is separately invariant under the electroweak group .    as evident from above",
    ", the one - loop level contributions to the @xmath18 and @xmath29 vertices arise only from the first two terms appearing in @xmath69 .",
    "a gauge - fixing procedure covariant under the @xmath3 group will be introduced below for the bilepton sector .",
    "it has already been mentioned that the fpm fails to quantize yang - mills theories possessing more general supplementary conditions than the linear ones .",
    "this stems from the fact that the fpm leads to an action which is bilinear in the ghost and antighost fields since they arise essentially from the integral representation of a determinant .",
    "this is not however the most general situation that can arise since an action including quartic ghost interactions at the tree level is still consistent with brst symmetry and the power counting criterion of renormalization theory .",
    "it turns out that the fpm does succeed when applied to linear gauges because quartic ghost interactions can not arise from loop effects due to antighost translation invariance , , with @xmath76 arbitrary constant parameters . ] which stems from the fact that the antighost fields appear only through their derivatives .",
    "however , this symmetry is lost in the case of nonlinear gauges since the gauge - fixing functions depend on bilinear terms of gauge fields .",
    "these terms are responsible for the presence of ultraviolet - divergent quartic - ghost interactions at one - loop level .",
    "this means that renormalizability becomes ruined when the fpm is attempted to be used in the context of nonlinear gauges .",
    "it is thus convenient to discard the fpm and building up instead the most general action consistent with brst symmetry and renormalization theory .",
    "brst symmetry arises naturally from the field - antifield formalism @xcite , which has proved a powerful tool in quantizing gauge systems . in the case of yang - mills systems",
    ", the gauge - fixed brst action has a simple structure @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the gauge - invariant classical action , @xmath79 is the brst operator , and @xmath80 is the fermion action .",
    "@xmath81 would be nondegenerate if a gauge - fixing procedure for all the gauge fields of the model was introduced .",
    "since we are only interested in the virtual effects of the bileptons , a gauge - fixing procedure for these fields is only necessary .",
    "furthermore , we use a gauge - fixing procedure covariant under the @xmath3 group because we are interested in preserving such a symmetry .",
    "the resultant @xmath81 action is nondegenerate with respect to the bilepton fields , boson can be introduced without affecting the @xmath82-invariance of @xmath81 . ] but degenerate with respect to the electroweak fields . as a consequence , a @xmath82-invariant quantum action can be constructed out of which gauge - invariant green functions , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , satisfying simple ward identities , can be derived .",
    "more specifically , we introduce a fermion action defined as follows : @xmath85 , \\ \\ \\",
    "\\bar{a}=4,5,6,7 ; \\ \\ \\ b , c=1,\\cdots 8,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are the gauge - fixing functions , the antighost fields , and the auxiliary scalar fields associated with the @xmath89 gauge fields , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath90 are the ghost fields associated with the @xmath12 fields , @xmath91 are the @xmath23 structure constants , and @xmath92 is the gauge parameter .",
    "note that the @xmath93 term can not arise from the fpm , though its presence is necessary to obtain renormalizability when the gauge - fixing functions are nonlinear . using the usual brst transformations ,",
    "we obtain for the @xmath80 variation @xmath94.\\ ] ] on the other hand , since the auxiliary fields @xmath88 appear quadratically , they can be integrated out in the generating functional .",
    "since the coefficients of the quadratic terms do not depend on the fields , their integration is equivalent to applying the equations of motion to the gauge - fixed brst action .",
    "once these steps are done , we obtain an action defined by the following @xmath3-invariant lagrangian @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the gauge invariant lagrangian of the @xmath21 model , whereas @xmath97 and @xmath98 arise from the action @xmath99 .",
    "the former is the gauge - fixing term , which can be written as @xmath100 and @xmath98 represents the ghost sector : @xmath101 while the first term in this lagrangian does arise when the fpm is used , the remaining ones are new and must be preserved if a nonlinear function @xmath86 is introduced . if a linear gauge is used , these terms can be removed after invoking antighost - translation invariance .",
    "we are now ready to introduce the most general @xmath82-covariant @xmath86 functions , and we will take advantage of the fact that every coupling involving at least one pseudo - goldstone boson and every coupling with gauge freedom can be modified leaving unaltered the @xmath8 matrix . the most general renormalizable gauge - fixing functions consistent with this symmetry can be written as @xmath102 notice that these gauge - fixing functions are nonlinear in both the vector and the scalar sectors . to be fully aware of the covariant structure of these gauge - fixing functions , it is convenient to express them in terms of the mass eigenstates fields . using the definitions @xmath103 we can write @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the @xmath3-covariant derivative given in the doublet representation",

    "as far as @xmath181 is concerned , it ranges from @xmath205 to @xmath227 in the same @xmath211 range , which means that this form factor has essentially the same behavior than the sm contribution .",
    "also , we can see that a more heavy bilepton , with a mass in the range @xmath229 , yields both @xmath180 and @xmath181 at the @xmath230 level , and they increase smoothly when the energy increases .",
    "this means that for very heavy bileptons , @xmath180 and @xmath181 are one order of magnitude smaller than the respective sm radiative correction .",
    "notice also that the inequality @xmath231 always holds , which is opposite to what is observed in the sm .",
    "this apparent contradiction stems from the fact that , in our case , the new physics effects are of decoupling nature : the form factors vanish in the limit of a very large mass @xmath211 .",
    "indeed , @xmath181 is always of decoupling nature since it arises from a nonrenormalizable dimension - six operator .",
    "in contrast , @xmath186 can be sensitive to nondecoupling effects since it is associated with a renormalizable lorentz structure of dimension four .",

    "the electroweak lagrangian is extended with nonrenormalizable operators of dimension higher than four respecting the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "in particular , anomalous contributions to the @xmath180 and @xmath181 form factors are induced by the following @xmath3-invariant dimension - six operators @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the sm higgs doublet and @xmath235 , with @xmath236 the pauli matrices .",
    "the @xmath237 constants , which parametrize the details of the underlying physics , could be determined once the fundamental theory is known .",
    "in addition , @xmath238 is the new physics scale .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath239 and @xmath240 operators induce contributions to @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "also , it has been shown that these operators can only be induced by the fundamental theory at one - loop or higher orders @xcite . assuming that these operators are induced at the one - loop level in the full theory , the associated @xmath237 constant must contain a factor of @xmath241 together with an additional coefficient @xmath242 or @xmath243 for each gauge field . taking the bilepton mass as the new physics scale ,",
    "it is natural to assume @xmath244 where @xmath245 and @xmath246 stand for the dimensionless loop functions , whose structure depends on the details of the underlying physics .",
    "since the new physics effects are of decoupling nature , the loop functions @xmath245 and @xmath246 are expected to be of order @xmath247 at most . under this assumption , a straightforward evaluation shows that @xmath180 goes from @xmath248 to @xmath249 for @xmath229 , whereas @xmath181 ranges from @xmath250 to @xmath251 .",
    "this simple qualitative discussion shows that our results are in agrement with those expected in a decoupling scenario of physics beyond the fermi scale .",
    "there is a plenty of good reasons to expect the appearance of new physics beyond the sm , but it still remains a mystery how and where this class of effects would show up .",
    "any new particles would arise by direct production if there is enough energy available , or through their virtual effects on some observable .",
    "the last scenario seems to be the most promising if the new particles have masses much larger than the fermi scale . in this case ,",
    "high precision measurements are needed in order to detect any deviation from the sm predictions .",
    "we have examined this possibility via the radiative corrections to the @xmath18 and @xmath29 vertices , which would play a special role at nlc experiments .",
    "the one - loop contribution to these couplings from the new gauge bosons predicted by the minimal @xmath21 model was studied in a @xmath82-invariant way by introducing a nonlinear quantization method .",
    "this scheme , even though conventional in the sense that it is based on brst symmetry , enables one to assess the new physics effects predicted by the 331 model on the sm green functions through a quantum action that is invariant under the electroweak group .",
    "special emphasis was put on discussing the similarities between our quantization method and the bfm . the main ingredient shared by both methods",
    "is that they allow one to construct gauge - invariant quantum actions .",
    "it is worth emphasizing however that while the bfm can be used at all energies , as gauge - invariance is preserved with respect to the gauge group of the full theory , the one presented here is only appropriate to study heavy physics effects on low - energy ( sm ) green functions . in the latter case",
    "the complete quantum action is only invariant under a subgroup of the theory .",
    "the @xmath82 invariance of the loop amplitudes associated with the @xmath18 and @xmath29 vertices was showed and special emphasis was put on the inherent simplicity of the calculation .",
    "our results show that for a relative light bilepton , with mass in the range @xmath252 , both @xmath180 and @xmath181 take values within the range of the sm contribution . on the other hand , for a more heavy bilepton , with mass in the range @xmath229",
    ", the form factors remain essentially uniform and are of the order of @xmath230 .",
    "it means that they are , respectively , two and one order of magnitude smaller than their sm counterpart .",
    "it was also shown that our results are in agreement with the expectations arising from a decoupling scenario of new physics , as argued in the light of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "our results suggest that it would be necessary a high experimental sensitivity in order to detect the virtual effects of new massive gauge bosons because it is hard that any heavy excitations arising from a renormalizable full theory could be much larger than the sm radiative corrections .",

    "<S> we study the one - loop sensitivity of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) vertex to the new massive gauge bosons predicted by the minimal @xmath2 model , which have unusual couplings to the standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> a gauge - fixing procedure covariant under the @xmath3 group was introduced for these new gauge bosons ( dubbed bileptons ) in order to generate gauge - invariant green functions . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities between this procedure and the nonconventional quantization scheme of the background field method are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , for relatively light bileptons , with a mass ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , the radiative corrections to the form factors associated with the @xmath0 vertex can be of the same order of magnitude than the sm one . in the case of heavier bileptons , </S>",
    "<S> their contribution is smaller by about one and two orders of magnitude than their sm counterpart . </S>"
