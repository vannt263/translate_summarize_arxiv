    "@xcite , the disentanglement of the wave functions at scission between two independent fragments is an essential ingredient for calculations of the dynamical observables that characterize the fission .",
    "the pauli principle involves a correlation between the fission fragments even after their separation .",
    "the condition of conservation for the number of particles in the bcs theory implies the existence of only one value of the fermi energy in the precise moment when the nucleus breaks",
    ". the total number of nucleons of the system should be equal with the sum of the occupations probabilities of the single particle states of both fragments .",
    "but , in order to have integer numbers of nucleons in each of the two partners , at least two fermi energies are required .",
    "it is questionable when and how these two fermi energies are created and how the nucleus shares the nucleons to obtain the final mass numbers . in order to understand this phenomenon ,",
    "the gaps and the fermi energies will be investigated at scission with the pairing density - dependent delta interaction ( dddi ) formalism and with the woods - saxon two center shell model .",
    "the dddi approach allows to determine a state - dependent pairing interaction while the two center shell model offers the possibility to identify the localization of the single particle states in the fission fragments . for reflection - symmetric fission ,",
    "the distribution of single particle occupation probabilities is the same for the two similar single particle levels schemes of the fragments .",
    "therefore , the numbers of nucleons should be the same in the two fission products .",
    "the problem arises when reflection - asymmetries are considered at scission .",
    "the bcs theory with a constant pairing force allows only one distribution of single particle occupation probabilities that depends on the whole nuclear structure .",
    "this distribution of occupation probabilities is constrained by the total number of nucleons and gives non - integer values of the nucleon numbers in the two partners .",
    "therefore , the alpha - decay of a superheavy element considered as a superasymmetric fission process will be treated as a limiting case .",
    "microscopic approaches based on the hartree - fock theory or the macroscopic - microscopic method have been used in the investigation in disintegration processes .",
    "the former approach is the more fundamental way to determine the driving potential .",
    "it starts with a realistic force between nucleons and constructs an appropriate many - body equation . surpassing huge numerical difficulties",
    ", this approach can be used now to determine the barrier in cluster decay @xcite or for fission @xcite .",
    "however , the way in which the passage from one nucleus into two separated bodies is envisaged remains a peculiar behavior of this picture .",
    "the basic idea of the alternative more phenomenological approach is that a macroscopic model , as the liquid drop one , describes quantitatively the smooth trends of the potential energy with respect to the particle number and the deformation whereas a microscopic formalism such as the shell model describes local fluctuations .",
    "the mixed macroscopic - microscopic method should reproduce both smooth trends and local fluctuations .",
    "the reliability of the latter approach was already tested in the case of @xmath0-decay by considering the process like a superasymmetric spontaneous fission @xcite process . for the microscopic part the woods - saxon two center shell model",
    "is used @xcite .    in the macroscopic - microscopic method ,",
    "the whole system is characterized by some collective coordinates that determine approximately the behavior of many other intrinsic variables @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient in such an analysis is the shape parametrization that depends on several macroscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the generalized coordinates associated with these degrees of freedom vary in time leading to a split of the nuclear system in two separated fragments .",
    "the model is valid as long as the time - dependent variations of the generalized coordinates make sense .",
    "we use an axial symmetric nuclear shape that offers the possibility to obtain a continuous transition from one initial nucleus to the separated fragments .",
    "this parametrization is obtained by smoothly joining two spheroids of semi - axis @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4=1,2 ) with a neck surface generated by the rotation of a circle of radius @xmath5 around the axis of symmetry . by imposing the condition of volume conservation",
    "we are left with five independent generalized coordinates \\{@xmath6 } ( @xmath4=1,5 ) that can be associated to five degrees of freedom : the elongation @xmath7 given by the distance between the centers of the spheroids ; the necking parameter @xmath8 related to the curvature of the neck , the eccentricities @xmath9 ( @xmath4=1,2 ) associated with the deformations of the nascent fragments and the mass asymmetry parameter @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively , the mass asymmetry can be characterized also by the mass number of the light fragment @xmath11 .",
    "this number is obtained by considering that the sum of the volumes of two virtual ellipsoids characterized by the mass asymmetry parameter @xmath12 and the eccentricities @xmath13 ( @xmath4=1,2 ) gives the volume of the parent .",
    "the nuclear shape is displayed in fig .",
    "[ forme ] where the geometrical parameters could be identified .",
    "the macroscopic deformation energy is calculated in the framework of the finite range liquid drop model @xcite .",
    "a so called correction to the macroscopic value is then evaluated using the strutinsky procedure @xcite .",
    "the strutinsky effects contain two terms : a shell correction and a pairing one .",
    "the shell corrections take into account non - uniformities in the nuclear structure as function of the deformation or the number of nucleons .",
    "no information about the pairing are given by the macroscopic energy or the shell effects .",
    "therefore , only the pairing corrections are interesting for our treatment .",
    "the pairing corrections in the framework of the macroscopic - microscopic model are given by the difference @xmath14 between an exact value and an averaged one .",
    "the total energy with paring interactions can be approximated with the relation @xmath15 the energy of a system without taking into consideration the variations of occupation probabilities and for an uniform distribution of levels reads @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 labels the fermi level , @xmath18 is the average level density at the smoothed fermi energy @xmath19 , @xmath20 the number of nucleons , @xmath21 is the averaged pairing interaction , and @xmath22 mev is an average gap @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the last two terms in the average pairing energy @xmath23 with the interaction strength @xmath24 is contained already in the liquid drop part of the total energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , a problem is raised by this average pairing energy when the nucleus is split into two fragments .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite emphasized the fact that a double counting should be envisaged at scission that can be eliminated by considering a dependence of the pairing strength with deformation @xcite .      the many - body wave function and the single particle energies are provided by the woods - saxon two - center shell model @xcite .",
    "the woods - saxon potential , the coulomb interaction and the spin orbit term must be diagonalized in a double center eigenvectors basis .",
    "a complete analytical eigenvectors basis can be only obtained for the semi - symmetric two - center oscillator .",
    "this potential corresponds to a shape parametrization given by two ellipsoids that possess the same semi - axis perpendicular on the axis of symmetry .",
    "the potential is @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the stiffness of the potential along different directions as follows , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , in order to ensure a constant value of the potential on the surface . the origin on the @xmath32-axis is considered as the location of the plane of intersection between the two ellipsoids .      in this unique hermite space",
    ", the behavior of both fragments can be described simultaneously .",
    "the orthogonal wave functions are centered in one of the two regions in three - dimensional position space . each wave function",
    "is analytically continued in both regions . in an intermediate situation of two partially overlapped potentials ,",
    "each eigenfunction has components in the two subspaces that belong to the fragments .",
    "when the elongation @xmath54 is zero , the eigenvectors basis becomes that of a single anisotropic oscillator and the hermite function is transformed into an hermite polynomial .",
    "when @xmath54 tends to infinity , a two oscillators eigenvectors system is obtained naturally in the same hermite space , centered in the middle of the two fragments .",
    "asymptotically , when the elongation tends to infinity , only one of the values @xmath55 or @xmath56 is transformed into an integer .",
    "the associated hermite function becomes a hermite polynomial with its proper normalization constant . in the same time , the normalization constant of the other hermite function reaches a zero value .",
    "the pauli principle is fulfilled .",
    "even for symmetric two center potentials , only one state is simultaneously active in all the position space . therefore , the two center shell model always provides the wave functions associated to the lower energies of the single particle states pertaining to a major quantum number @xmath57 . as a consequence , molecular states formed by two fragments at scission could be precisely described .",
    "in contrast to the cluster approximations , the two - center shell model offers the opportunity to treat fission in a wide range of mass asymmetries @xcite and offers to opportunity to consider the alpha decay as a superasymmetric fission process @xcite .    if the wave function is located in only one of the two potential wells , it is possible to identify the single particle states that belong to each fragment at scission .",
    "the square of the single particle wave function of each state is integrated separately in the two subspaces and two probabilities are obtained .",
    "the single particle wave function is located in the well characterized by the larger probability .",
    "such tasks were already performed @xcite in order to estimate the partition of the excitation energy in fission processes between the two partners .",
    "a simple treatment of the pairing interaction in which the major contribution to the residual interaction is coming from the nuclear surface region is given by the dddi model @xcite .",
    "the following spatial modulation of the pairing strength is postulated @xcite as follows : @xmath58 \\label{i0}\\ ] ] the fitting parameters @xmath59=1 and @xmath60=1 are usually considered as unity . the saturation density of the nuclear matter is @xmath61=0.16 @xmath62 , while the @xmath63 is the local density .",
    "we consider here that the local nuclear density is shape dependent and its behavior can be described by a woods - saxon function , in accordance to the shape of the potential used .",
    "the parameters @xmath64 of the interaction ( [ i0 ] ) should be adjusted to reproduce observables . in our case ,",
    "the observable is the pairing gap .",
    "values of the model dependent strength parameters @xmath64 are deduced in several works , as for example in ref .",

    "the values deduced in our treatment are different , as it will be specified later .",
    "the calculations based on this schematic pairing interaction could be solved on a finite space of states , called active levels pairing space .",
    "this space is limited by some cutoff in the single particle energies .",
    "for the pairing field given by formula ( [ i0 ] ) , the state - dependent pairing interaction strengths @xmath66 are defined as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the wave function of the state @xmath69 in the position representation .",
    "the pairing state - dependent gaps resort from the bcs equations @xmath70 that are correlated by the condition of a fixed number of pairs @xmath71 in the active levels pairing space : @xmath72 in the previous equalities , it is considered that the index @xmath4 run over @xmath73 levels around the fermi energy .",

    "a reliable value for the energy gap can be obtained with the five points formula @xcite that takes into account the experimental masses .",
