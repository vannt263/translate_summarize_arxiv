    "the @xmath27 values exhibit an even / odd family behavior depending on the number of carbon atoms in the chain .",

    "having shown the stable carbon chain structures grown on bn , we next investigate the growth of short bn chains on graphene to see if a similar self - assembly mechanism is also present for this reverted situation .",

    "it was found that , the binding site of a bn chain on the graphene depends on the type of its closest atom to the graphene .",
    "a nb(@xmath7 ) chain is bound to the graphene layer at the bridge site , and a bn(@xmath7 ) is bound at the top site as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . however , both single b and single n ad - atoms are bound at the bridge site .",
    "contrary to the cac case , no clear even / odd disparity was obtained in h - bn+graphene complexes owing to the ionic bonding between b - n atoms .",
    "here there is another effect related with the number of electrons in the chain .",
    "chains having odd number of atoms have odd number of electrons , while even numbered chains have even number of electrons .",
    "the binding energies of these chains shown in in table [ table : 2 ] suggest that bn chains are bound with higher energies to the graphene as compared to the binding energies of cacs on bn , especially for longer chains . the binding energy of a boron ending chain ( i.e. nb ) is always higher than a nitrogen ending chain ( i.e. bn ) site . here",
    "we note that the supercell size and adsorbate - adsorbate    the even / odd disparity observed in the magnetic properties of cac(@xmath7)+h - bn are also not seen for bn chains grown on graphene .",
    "single b ad - atom as well as single n ad - atom adsorbed on graphene have magnetic ground states .",
    "however , while bn(2 ) and nb(2 ) chains on graphene are nonmagnetic , bn(3 ) and nb(3 ) on graphene have magnetic ground states .",
    "this order is disturbed by the chain consisting of four atoms ; while bn(4)+graphene is nonmagnetic , nb(4)+graphene has magnetic ground state .",
    "the electronic structures calculated for a single adsorbate , namely single boron and nitrogen ad - atoms , and single nb(2 ) and bn(2 ) molecules , perpendicularly attached to ( 4x4 ) supercell of graphene are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . owing to their odd number of electrons , single n and b ad - atoms shift the fermi level up and down relative to the dirac point of graphene .",
    "this is an important feature to be used in electronic applications of single layer graphene .",
    "for nb(2)+graphene the bands crossing at the fermi level attribute semimetallic character . on the other hand ,",
    "bn(2)+graphene is a semiconductor with a narrow indirect band gap .",
    "this situation shows the dramatic effect of the type of chain atom which is attached to graphene .",
    "in addition , the supercell size , adsorbates - adsorbate coupling , as well as the symmetry of the adsorbate+supercell system are crucial for the resulting electronic structure for small supercells.@xcite for example , the semiconductor presented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( d ) becomes metallic when bn+graphene system is treated in ( 6x6 ) supercell . in the case of",
    "very large supercell having single adsorbate attached the band crossing is recovered and the states of adsorbate appear as localized ( resonance ) impurity states .",
    "in conclusion , using first - principles calculations within the density functional theory , we revealed the growth mechanism of carbon and bn atomic chains on single layer honeycomb structures , namely hexagonal bn(or h - bn ) and graphene , respectively .",
    "we found that with the inclusion of each new carbon atom , the existing atomic chain consisting of @xmath7 carbon atom leaves its previous position to join with the new carbon atom to from a chain of @xmath34 carbon atom .",
    "similar , but more complex growth mechanisms were also found for bn chains grown on graphene layers depending on the type of chain atom(b or n ) which is attached to graphene .",
    "these growth processes were simulated by ab - initio molecular dynamics calculations at various temperatures and the resulting chain structures were shown to be stable even though they are free to bend and slightly tilt .",
    "nevertheless , these simulations are performed at high temperatures(1000k ) and the chains did not detach from the substrate plane for 10ps which is adequately long for ab - initio molecular dynamics simulations . therefore these simulations presents reliable stability results , especially at room temperature .",
    "the growth of atomic chains on the single layer honeycomb structures heralds a self - assembly process , which may have fundamental and technological implications .    the grown chains by themselves , exhibit interesting physical and chemical properties depending on the number of atoms forming the chain and the type of chain atom attaching to the substrate .",
    "in particular , the physical properties of even numbered and odd numbered carbon chains can behave differently leading to interesting even - odd disparity .",
    "we also showed that atomic chains grown on single layer substrates attribute useful functionalities to bare h - bn and graphene .",
    "these properties are dependent on the number of carbon atoms in the chains .",
    "apart from creating localized electronic states in the band gap and local magnetic moments it is demonstrated that carbon chains can also be used for increasing the interlayer spacing between bn flakes , where specific molecules can be stored .",
    "atomic chains grown on graphene and h - bn create chemically active sites on bn surface for atoms such as au , li and h@xmath0 , which provides the connection of these materials . additionally , specific atoms forming strong bonds with atomic chains modify the electronic structure in the band gap and hence change the conductivity for possible sensor applications .",
    "similarly , modifications of the electronic properties of graphene depending on the grown b or n ad - atoms and bn or nb chains are also worth emphasizing . moving the fermi level of graphene up or down by adsorbing n or b atoms ,",
    "respectively can be a worthwhile feature in the electronic applications related with graphene .",
