    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) exhibits interesting nonperturbative phenomena such as spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking and color confinement , which are considered to be related to the nontrivial structure of the qcd vacuum . in order to clarify the mechanism of these phenomena and their relation to the qcd vacuum",
    ", extensive studies have been made .",
    "in fact , at high temperature , qcd is believed to exhibit phase transition into the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , where chiral symmetry is restored and the color is deconfined .",
    "the qgp phase is considered to have been actually realized in the early universe , and the on - going rhic experiments attempt to produce qgp in the laboratory through relativistic heavy - ion collisions , which motivates further studies of finite temperature qcd .    for",
    "the theoretical study of the qcd vacuum structure at finite temperature , the condensates such as @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 play the relevant role , because they characterize the nontrivial qcd vacuum directly .",
    "in fact , at finite temperature , changes of the structure of the qcd vacuum will be represented by the thermal effects on the condensates .    in this paper , we study the thermal effects on the quark - gluon mixed condensate @xmath10 for the following reasons .",
    "first of all , we note that the chirality of the quark in the operator @xmath0 flips as @xmath11 therefore , @xmath0 plays the role of a chiral order parameter , which can indicate chiral restoration at finite temperature , as well as the usual quark condensate @xmath4 .",
    "secondly , we emphasize that @xmath0 characterizes different aspect of the qcd vacuum from @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 reflects the color - octet components of quark - antiquark pairs in the qcd vacuum , while @xmath4 reflects only the color - singlet @xmath12-@xmath13 components .",
    "the mixed condensate @xmath0 thus represents the direct correlation between color - octet @xmath12-@xmath13 pairs and the gluon field strength @xmath14 , i.e. , the color - electromagnetic field spontaneously generated in the qcd vacuum  .",
    "therefore , the thermal effects on @xmath0 in comparison with that of @xmath4 will give new and important information on chiral restoration of the qcd vacuum at finite temperature .",
    "as the third point , we show how the mixed condensate affects the properties of hadrons .",
    "to clarify the physical meaning of the condensates , the qcd sum rule is a useful framework , in which the hadronic properties can be directly connected to the various condensates with the help of the dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "one of the examples where the mixed condensate plays an important role is the qcd sum rule for baryons  @xcite . in the actual calculation of such sum rules , especially in the decuplet baryons ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath0 amounts to the same magnitude as the leading contribution from @xmath4 , and the mixed condensate has large effects on the @xmath15-@xmath16 splitting  @xcite . in terms of the chiral properties of baryons ,",
    "the parity splittings of baryons stem from the chiral - odd condensates such as @xmath4 and @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent study  @xcite shows that the parameter @xmath17 is a key quantity for the prediction on the parity of the recently discovered penta - quark baryon , @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the mixed condensate is also important in other sum rules such as light - heavy meson systems  @xcite , and exotic meson systems  @xcite . in these respects ,",
    "the evaluation of the thermal effects on @xmath0 is expected to give a useful input in qcd sum rules to investigate hadron phenomenology at finite temperature .    for the analysis of the thermal effects on the mixed condensate @xmath0",
    ", we use lattice qcd monte carlo simulation , which is the direct and nonperturbative calculation from qcd .",
    "so far , the mixed condensate at zero temperature has been analyzed phenomenologically in the qcd sum rules  @xcite . in the lattice qcd , a pioneering work   was done long time ago , but the result was rather preliminary because the simulation was done with insufficient statistics using a small and coarse lattice . recently",
    ", new lattice calculations have been developed by our group  @xcite using the kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermion , and by another group  @xcite using the domain - wall fermion . at finite temperature , however , there has been no result on @xmath0 except for our early reports  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we present in this paper the first and intensive results of the thermal effects on @xmath0 as well as @xmath4 , including the analysis near the critical temperature .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we explain the formalism to evaluate the condensates . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] , we present the lattice qcd data , and discuss the physical implication of the results . sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary of the paper .",
    "in the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath4 , we use the su(3)@xmath1 lattice qcd with the ks - fermion at the quenched level .",
    "we note that the ks - fermion preserves the explicit chiral symmetry for the quark mass @xmath19 , which is a desirable feature to study both the condensates of chiral order parameters . in order to evaluate the condensates",
    ", we calculate the su(4)@xmath20 flavor - averaged condensates on the lattice as @xmath21 \\ ] ] and @xmath22 . \\ ] ] here , `` @xmath23 '' refers to the trace over the spinor and the color indices , and @xmath24 denotes the euclidean quark propagator of the @xmath25-th flavor . for the gluon field strength @xmath26",
    ", we adopt the clover - type definition on the lattice to eliminate @xmath27 discretization error , @xmath28 + { \\rm h.c . } , { \\nonumber\\\\}\\label{eq : clover}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the plaquette operator , and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the color su(3 ) gell - mann matrix . in the ks - fermion formalism , su(4)@xmath20 quark - spinor fields , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "are converted into single - component grassmann ks - fields , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , with the proper insertion of gauge - link variables which ensure the gauge covariance  @xcite .",
    "note that the contraction of flavor and spinor indices corresponds to summation over the ks - hypercube  @xcite and suppresses @xmath27 discretization error .",
    "the detailed formulations and the diagrammatic representations for the calculation of the condensates are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations with the standard wilson gauge action for @xmath34 and @xmath3 .",
    "the lattice units are obtained as @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath3 , respectively , where we use the lattice data  @xcite with the string tension @xmath42 .    in order to perform the calculation at various temperatures ,",
    "we use the following lattices ,    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]      + which correspond to @xmath5 with the spatial volume of @xmath43 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath7 is obtained from the polyakov - loop susceptibility  @xcite in terms of the confinement / deconfinement phase transition . from the polyakov - loop susceptibility on the above three lattices",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 , or @xmath45 280mev , which is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we generate 100 gauge configurations for each lattice , where we pick up each configuration for every 500 sweeps after 1000 sweeps for the thermalization . in the vicinity of the phase transition point , namely , @xmath46 at @xmath47 and @xmath48 at @xmath49 ,",
    "the fluctuations of the condensates get larger .",
    "we hence generate 1000 gauge configurations on these two lattices for the accurate estimate . for the lattices at @xmath50",
    ", we only use the gauge configurations which are continuously connected to the trivial vacuum @xmath51 .    to obtain the condensates",
    ", we calculate the euclidean propagator by solving the matrix inverse equations . here",
    ", we use the current - quark mass of @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( @xmath49 ) , which correspond to the physical mass of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . for the ks - fields , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the anti - periodic condition is imposed at the boundary in both the temporal and spatial directions . in each configuration , we measure the condensates on 16 different physical space - time points at @xmath55 and 2 points at @xmath64 and @xmath3 .",
    "these points are taken so as to be equally spaced in the lattice 4-dimensional volume , i.e. , on the lattices with the volume @xmath65 in the lattice unit , we take 16 points at @xmath55 as @xmath66 with @xmath67 , and 2 points at @xmath47 and @xmath3 as @xmath68 . in addition , the summation over the ks - hypercube is taken on each selected space - time point . at each quark mass @xmath69 and temperature , we thus achieve high statistics as 1600 data at @xmath55 and 200 data at @xmath47 and @xmath3 .",
    "note that for the lattices of @xmath46 ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath71 ) , we obtain 2000 data , which guarantees reliability of the results even in the vicinity of the critical temperature .",
    "at each temperature , we calculate the condensates @xmath4 and @xmath0 at three different quark masses , @xmath69 .",
    "we observe that both the condensates show a clear linear behavior against the quark mass at every finite temperature , as was seen in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we fit the data with a linear function and determine the condensates in the chiral limit .    we comment here on the error estimate and the numerical check on the finite - volume effect in lattice qcd .",
    "the statistical error is estimated with the jackknife method . in the vicinity of @xmath7 ,",
    "i.e. , on @xmath73 at @xmath47 and @xmath74 at @xmath49 , we conservatively suppress the autocorrelation by performing binning of the size of 10 .",
    "we find that the statistical error is typically 5 - 7% level for every temperature .",
    "for the check of the finite - volume artifact , we examine the condensates imposing the periodic condition on the ks - fields , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , instead of the anti - periodic condition , at the 3-dimensional spatial boundaries .",
    "we perform the calculations with typical lattices of @xmath48 @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath77 , which corresponds to @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , and find that the dependence of the condensates on the spatial boundary condition is only 1% level . for @xmath80 lattice case , it was shown that the finite - volume artifact for @xmath81 lattice is only 1% level in ref.@xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the physical volume @xmath82 in our simulations is large enough to avoid the finite volume artifact .",
    "we estimate the thermal effects on each condensate , @xmath0 , or @xmath4 , by taking the ratio between the values at finite and zero temperatures . in this ratio ,",
    "the renormalization constants are canceled because there is no operator mixing for both the condensates in the chiral limit  @xcite . here",
    ", at each @xmath83 , we use the value at the lowest temperature as a substitute for the value at zero temperature .",
    "this approximation can be justified because the finite - volume artifact for the lowest temperature is almost negligible , as was shown for @xmath81 lattice .     at finite temperature @xmath84 normalized by @xmath85 .",
    "the vertical dashed line denotes the critical temperature @xmath6 in quenched qcd . ]    in figure  [ fig : qgq_finite_t ] , we plot the thermal effects on @xmath0 .",
    "we find a drastic change of @xmath0 around the critical temperature @xmath6 .",
    "this is the first observation of chiral - symmetry restoration through @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain @xmath86 , which is consistent with the coincidence of the confinement / deconfinement phase transition and chiral - symmetry phase restoration .",
    "we also find that the thermal effects on @xmath0 are remarkably weak below @xmath7 , namely , @xmath87 . in figure",
    "[ fig : qq_finite_t ] , the thermal effects on @xmath4 are plotted , and the same features as @xmath0 are obtained .     at finite temperature @xmath84",
    "normalized by @xmath88 .",
    "the vertical dashed line denotes @xmath7 . ]",
    "we then quantitatively compare the thermal effects of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "for this purpose , we plot the ratio @xmath89 normalized by @xmath90 for @xmath91 in figure  [ fig : m0_finite_t ] .",
    "we observe that @xmath92 is almost independent of the temperature , even in the very vicinity of @xmath7 , which can be interpreted that @xmath93 and @xmath94 obey the same thermal behavior .",
    "this result is rather nontrivial because , as was noted before , these two condensates characterize different aspects of the qcd vacuum .",
    "normalized by @xmath90 plotted against @xmath84 .",
    "this result indicates the same chiral behavior between @xmath93 and @xmath94 . ]    as a new interesting feature absent in the scalar - type condensate @xmath4 , @xmath0 may reveal possible breaking of the space - time duality in euclidean qcd at finite temperature . for further analysis in this direction",
    ", we investigate the thermal effects on electric / magnetic components of @xmath0 separately , i.e. , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "hereafter , no summation is taken for @xmath97 .",
    "of course , the equality @xmath98 holds at zero temperature from o(4 ) symmetry in euclidean qcd .",
    "this equality , however , does not necessarily hold for finite temperature , where the space - time duality is explicitly broken .",
    "in fact , at finite temperature , @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be regarded as different chiral order parameters .",
    "we therefore plot the ratio @xmath101 defined by @xmath102 at finite temperature @xmath103 in figure  [ fig : qgq_b",
    "/ e_finite_t ] .",
    "one sees that the equality @xmath104 holds for even at finite temperature .",
    "this again indicates that all the @xmath105 components of @xmath93 obey the same chiral behavior near @xmath7 .",
    "plotted against the temperature @xmath84 .",
    "this result indicates @xmath95 and @xmath96 obey the same chiral behavior . ]    in this way , we observe that the chiral condensates , i.e. , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , obey the almost identical behavior near @xmath7 .",
    "one of the possible explanations of this similarity is given by the so - called `` swiss cheese picture '' .",
    "in this picture , phase structure of the qcd vacuum at the critical temperature is represented by the mixture of co - existing two phases , i.e. , chiral - broken phase and chiral - symmetric phase .",
    "since the deconfinement phase transition is of the first order in the quenched approximation , the co - existence of two phases is plausible . in this scenario ,",
    "the common thermal behaviors of the chiral condensates can be explained if the thermal effects are mainly characterized by the volume ratio of the two phases and the thermal effects on each phase are subdominant . since this consideration",
    "can be applied to any chiral condensates , this scenario predicts a universal behavior of all chiral order parameters near @xmath7 , which provides new aspects on the chiral structure of the qcd phase transition .",
    "the common thermal behaviors of the chiral condensates can be also explained from a different viewpoint . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we can express the condensates as @xmath110 { g{{\\langle}\\bar{q}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}g_{\\mu\\nu } q { \\rangle}}}&= & \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{v}\\int d\\lambda ' \\frac{m \\rho(\\lambda')}{\\lambda'^2 + m^2 } { { \\langle}\\lambda'|\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}g_{\\mu\\nu}|\\lambda ' { \\rangle } } , \\end{array } \\ ] ] where @xmath111 denotes the eigenvector of the dirac operator as @xmath112 , and @xmath113 the spectral density on @xmath114 .",
    "when one takes the chiral limit @xmath115 after the thermodynamic limit @xmath116 , the zero modes ( @xmath117 ) of the dirac operator are responsible for both the condensates . if @xmath118 does not have a singularity at @xmath117 , @xmath119 corresponds to @xmath120 .",
    "the universal chiral behavior against the temperature indicates that both the electric and the magnetic components of @xmath120 for the chiral zero modes have remarkably weak dependence on the temperature for @xmath91 , even in the very vicinity of @xmath7 .",
    "we have studied thermal effects on @xmath0 , in comparison with @xmath4 , using the su(3)@xmath1 lattice qcd with the ks - fermion at the quenched level . for @xmath87 ,",
    "both the condensates show very little thermal effect , while a clear signal of chiral restoration is observed near @xmath7 as a sharp decrease of both the condensates . it has been a surprise that the ratio @xmath121 , in contrast to the drastic change of each , is almost independent of the temperature in the entire region of @xmath84 up to @xmath7 .",
    "it is also found that the lorentz components , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , show an identical temperature dependence .",
    "such observations indicate that these chiral condensates show a common thermal behavior , which may reveal new aspects of the chiral restoration of the qcd vacuum . for further studies ,",
    "a full qcd lattice calculation is in progress in order to analyze the dynamical quark effects on the condensates . through the full qcd calculation and its comparison with quenched qcd",
