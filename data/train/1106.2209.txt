    "the results of various astronomical observations @xcite - @xcite show strong evidence for a large amount of dark matter in the universe .",
    "weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) are a dark matter candidate motivated in extensions of the theory of high energy particle physics @xcite .",
    "various dedicated wimp dark matter search experiments are underway around the world @xcite - @xcite . the xmass experiment , using liquid xenon ( lxe ) as a target for wimp dark matter , was proposed in 2000 @xcite .",
    "the construction of the 800 kg detector was finished in 2010 .",
    "the interaction of wimp dark matter is observed as a nuclear recoil in a specific detector s target material , which in our case is lxe .",
    "the main backgrounds ( bg ) for such nuclear recoil events are electron events ( from photoabsorption or compton scattering of environmental gamma rays ) , nuclear recoils from the scattering of fast neutrons , and possibly alpha and beta decays in the detector medium itself .",
    "the aim of this study is to use the shape of scintillation light pulse in lxe to discriminate against electron events .",
    "the scintillation mechanism is classified into two processes determined by whether or not the process includes recombination @xcite .    *",
    "the process without recombination * @xmath9    * the process with recombination * @xmath10    both processes lead to the formation of exciton ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the de - excitation has two components called singlet and triplet component .",
    "the singlet component is caused by a spin singlet state ( @xmath12 ) , and the triplet component is caused by a spin triplet state ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the shape of the scintillation light pulse in lxe is determined by the lifetimes of the excited states , the time scale of electron - ion recombination , the timing resolution of the photo detector , the time of flight in the detector , and electronics employed to record the scintillation light .",
    "the convolution of all these components shapes the recorded scintillation light pulses .",
    "pulse shape measurements for 1mev electrons , @xmath14 particles and relativistic ions in lxe were reported @xcite . in the case of @xmath14 particles , two distinct lifetime components were observed .",
    "the lifetimes for singlet and triplet states were found to be approximately 4ns and 22ns respectively . in the case of electron events on the other hand ,",
    "only one component with 45ns lifetime was observed .",
    "this pulse shape difference is attributed to the influence of electron - ion recombination @xcite @xcite . in the case of electron event ,",
    "de / dx is one order of magnitude smaller than that in the case of a nuclear recoil @xcite @xcite , and the ensuing ionization is thus spread out over a larger volume . therefore the recombination process of electron events takes longer than that of nuclear recoil events and dominates the pulse evolution .",
    "this hypothesis was confirmed by measurements in electric fields , as the slow component was not observed when an external electric field is applied . under the influence of an external electric field recombination",
    "is suppressed by the drifting apart of the opposing charges , and the two components characteristic of high de / dx events re - emerge , so that the pulse shape of electron events in an electric field of 4kv / cm is very close to that of nuclear recoils in zero electric field @xcite . in this paper",
    "we aim to exploit the characteristically long time constant observed for electron events in lxe at zero electric field .    to this end",
    "we examine pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) in lxe at energies of less than 20kev@xmath4 ( electron equivalent kev ) .",
    "this energy range is most relevant for dark matter searches .",
    "the average waveform of nuclear recoil and electron events was previously compared above 10kev@xmath4 @xcite . but no event - by - event analysis was done .",
    "an event - by - event analysis was reported @xcite , but the light yield was one order of magnitude lower than our setup . using dual phase detectors the psd study was also performed @xcite . a reduction factor for electron events of 0.2 by psd alone",
    "was demonstrated at 5kev@xmath4 in a dual phase detector by limiting the electric field to 0.06kv / cm .",
    "previous investigations ( @xcite - @xcite ) were done at scintillation light yields below 5p.e./kev ( p.e .",
    "photoelectrons ) . using two closely spaced photomultipliers ( pmts ) of the kind also used in the xmass experiment we measure a light yield of 20.9p.e./kev , which is expected to us to clearly observe a difference in the pulse shapes of nuclear and electron events even at energies as low as 5kev@xmath4 .",
    "anticipating more limited light collection in real detectors we artificially reduced the photosensitive area in our experimental setup and repeated the measurements at an effective light yield of 4.6p.e./kev .",
    "our measurements were made in a dedicated setup shown in fig.[fig:6_1 ] .",
    "two 2inch hexagonal pmts ( hamamatsu r10789 ) facing each other from a distance of 6 cm are viewing the intervening lxe volume from the top and bottom respectively . to the sides",
    "the volume is limited by a highly reflective ptfe surface enclosing 0.58 kg of lxe in total .",
    "embedded in the ptfe reflector were a led and a 300bq @xmath15co source .",
    "the led was used to obtain single p.e .",
    "spectra and the source to monitor the pmt gain .",
    "the light yield from this source was found to be stable within 2% and is incorporated in our systematic uncertainty . to protect the lxe from radioactive contamination this @xmath15co source",
    "was enclosed in a thin stainless steel container .",
    "pmts , lxe , and the calibration light sources described above were all kept at -100@xmath16c inside a stainless steel vessel that itself is suspended inside a vacuum chamber for thermal insulation .",
    "radioactive sources placed outside of the lxe volume and its vacuum enclosure produce the recoil events used in this study : either a @xmath17cs source provides gamma rays that produce electron events or a gamma tagged @xmath18cf fission source provides neutrons to study nuclear recoils . to tag the fission events a plastic scintillator and a pmt ( pmt3 )",
    "were set up next to the cf source . in the direction of the lxe on the other hand",
    "the gamma rays emitted in the @xmath18cf fission events were shielded by 5 cm of lead .",
    "when filling the setup with lxe the xe gas was passed through a saes getter ( model ps4-mt3-r-1 ) to remove impurities in the xe gas . beyond this",
    "no further efforts were made to clean up the high purity xe used in this experiment .    for data acquisition we used nim logic to trigger recording of the waveform in a lecroy",
    "wavepro 900 digital oscilloscope as shown in fig.[fig : trig ] .",
    "events in the lxe volume are identified by a coincidence of signals in the two pmts that view the lxe volume .",
    "the width of the coincidence timing window is 100ns , and the discriminator thresholds were set to 2p.e .",
    "equivalent . as mentioned above a plastic scintillator",
    "is used to tag @xmath18cf fission events every time the cf source is employed to produce neutron events in the lxe . the corresponding signal from the pmt that reads out",
    "the plastic scintillator starts a 140ns gate that is only for neutron recoil data is also entered into the coincidence unit .",
    "the digital oscilloscope provides 8bit resolution and a 1ghz sampling rate .",
    "we used it to record 10@xmath19s traces of all pmt signals involved in the respective measurement with 1ns timing resolution .",
    "the gain of the two pmts reading out the lxe volume were both set to 3.8@xmath210@xmath20 at the operating temperature of -100@xmath16c , with the hv for pmt1 and pmt2 fixed at 1.26kv and 1.21kv , respectively . using the 1p.e .",
    "calibration obtained from the led data , the fit shown in fig.[fig : co ] to the @xmath15co spectrum determines the energy resolution to be 5.4% ( rms ) at 122kev and the scintillation light yield to be 20.9p.e./kev@xmath4 .",
    "light collection in real dark matter detectors will be more limited than in this small scale dedicated setup . to quantify the impact of the ensuing loss in statistical power on our discrimination method we artificially reduced the light collection in our setup by covering part of the photocathode area of the bottom pmt ( pmt2 ) with a copper mask . while the pmt1 signal was no longer used to estimate the deposited energy in our study of reduced effective light yield , its signal was used in the trigger during that study in just same way as usual .",
    "the resulting @xmath15co spectrum is shown in fig.[fig : pmt2_mask_co ] , using the p.e .",
    "count of only this bottom pmt .",
    "the effective light yield was thus reduced to 4.6p.e./kev@xmath4 and the energy resolution to 11.7% ( rms ) at 122 kev .",
    "a trigger offset of 260ns allowed us to monitor the baselines 260ns prior to the recording of our physics events . to clean up both our electron and nuclear recoil event samples",
    "we require that none of the events show any `` pre - activity '' in the first 150ns from the beginning of its pmt traces , i.e. from 260ns to 110ns prior to the event trigger time .",
    "the dynamic range of oscilloscope was chosen to saturate at a signal height of -400mv for the pmts that read out our lxe volume . to avoid problems with saturation",
    ", we disregard events where pmt traces from either pmt1 or pmt2 surpass 350mv , which is roughly equivalent to 1000p.e . for electron events .",

    "the peak at zero timing is due to @xmath18cf fission gammas passing through the lead shielding set up to suppress such direct gamma interference . to limit the gamma ray background in the sample and specifically select fast neutrons a narrow tof range from 15ns to 30ns",
