    "in this paper we address the issue of the correct pricing of options on credit swaps , where the reference entity is a portfolio of defaultable names .",
    "the most common case in the market are credit index options , which are options on the equilibrium level of the spread of a credit index , consisting of a standardized portfolio of credit default swaps .",
    "liquidity had improved in the years preceding the subprime crisis in summer 2007 , in particular in europe .",
    "monthly volumes for the option on the i - traxx crossover index were upwards 13 billion at the end of 2006 , with options available also on the main and high volatility indices and on index tranches . during the credit crisis in 2007 ,",
    "payer options have protected investors from the rise of the credit indices , and trading has restarted on these products just two weeks after the pitch of the crisis at the end of july 2007 .",
    "thus the main reference in the paper will be credit index swaptions , although the results apply in general to all market cases in which a spread defined with reference to a portfolio of defaultable entities must be modelled in an arbitrage - free way under an appropriate pricing measure .",
    "this includes dynamic notes linked to the performances of index spreads and embedded optionality in multiname credit derivatives .",
    "the credit index option gives to the investor the possibility to enter a forward credit index at a prespecified spread , and to receive upon exercise a front end protection corresponding to index losses from option inception to option expiry .",
    "the initial market approach for pricing credit index options was the use of a black formula to price the option as a call on the spread , adding then the value of the front end protection to the price of the call .",
    "this approach has a first major flaw .",
    "it neglects the fact that one can not separate the option from the front end protection , since the protection enters the exercise decision .",
    "this was pointed out first by pedersen ( 2003 ) .",
    "this observation led to an improved market standard , taking front end protection into account correctly without losing the tractability of the market black formula approach , based on a redefinition of the underlying index spread .",
    "however , as we show in this work , also the latter approach presents some relevant problems .",
    "first , there is still one scenario in which a black formula , even if improved by the use of a loss - adjusted index spread , does not take into account correctly the front end protection . in this scenario",
    "the pricing formula does not give the correct price of the option , while instead this could be computed in closed - form .",
    "we show in this work that , while this mispricing can be negligible for standard options in normal market conditions , it can become highly relevant for less standard options or in stressed market conditions .",
    "in particular , we show on 2007 market data that after the subprime credit crisis the mispricing of the market formula compared to the no arbitrage formula we propose has become financially relevant even for the most liquid crossover index options .",
    "a related second problem is that the formula used in market practice to compute the index spread is not defined in all states of the world .",
    "the third problem regards the theoretical justification of the use of a black formula in this context . according to the fundamental theorem of asset pricing",
    ", a rigorous derivation of a black formula for the pricing of a credit index option requires the definition of an appropriate numeraire for change to the pricing measure under which the underlying spread is a martingale ( see delbaen and schachermayer ( 1994 ) , geman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and jamshidian ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "the problem here is that , since we are dealing with portfolios or indices of defaultable names , the quantity that appears to be the natural choice for a numeraire to simplify pricing is not strictly positive .",
    "this makes the standard change of numeraire theory , based on strictly positive numeraires , inapplicable .",
    "one may use a kind of survival measure such as the one introduced by schonbucher ( 1999 ) for single name products , based on a numeraire which is not strictly positive .",
    "but such a measure would not be equivalent to the standard risk neutral , forward and swap measures used in mathematical finance , but only absolutely continuous with respect to them .",
    "this is practically undesirable , since in a such a case one can describe the dynamics of credit spreads under the survival measure , but can not use the standard girsanov theorem to see the dynamics of credit spreads under the standard measures used in mathematical finance . thus one could not , for example , extend a standard implementation of a libor market model ( brace , gatarek and musiela ( 1997 ) ) for default - free forward rates , usually done under a forward measure , to include also forward credit spreads .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the current literature does not solve the above three problems .",
    "the only partial exception is jackson ( 2005 ) , that deals with the first problem while not solving the second and third ones ( in particular he uses a numeraire which is not strictly positive ) . instead",
    ", here we show that the definition of an index spread valid in general , the correct description of the market payoff leading to a price defined in all states of the world , and the use of a valid strictly positive quantity to define an equivalent pricing measure can be given a general and elegant mathematical solution . the solution is based on the definition of appropriate subfiltrations .",
    "empirical tests show that this solution can also have a relevant impact on the correct price of multiname credit options .    in section [ section_themarket ]",
    "we introduce the setting and describe the credit forward index , that will be the reference underlying of the options considered in the paper .",
    "then we describe the credit index option payoff and we describe previous literature and market practice on the pricing of index options . in section [ section_indexspread ]",
    "we show the problems in the market approach and we introduce the main technical instrument that will allow us to solve them : subfiltrations . in particular we introduce a new subfiltration apt to credit portfolio products .",
    "then we use this instrument to compute a consistent and arbitrage - free definition of the underlying index spread . in section [ section_indexoption ]",
    "we introduce a new pricing measure and prove the main result of the paper , the formula for no - arbitrage pricing of index options , different from the standard market approach .",
    "we also show how , performing generalization of some fundamental results of jamshidian ( 2004 ) , it is possible to express this formula in terms of numeraire pricing . in section [ section_tests ]",
    "we apply our results to market data , before and after the summer 2007 subprime crisis , and we show how , in stressed market conditions like those the credit market is experiencing now , the no - arbitrage formula we introduce has a relevant impact on valuation of credit index options , avoiding a mispricing which is associated to the market standard valuation formula .",
    "we are in a complete filtered probability space @xmath0 , where the filtration @xmath1 satisfies the usual hypothesis and we set @xmath2 and @xmath3 for a terminal date @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the existence of a bank - account numeraire with price process @xmath5 and an associated risk neutral measure @xmath6 .",
    "defining , in line with jamshidian ( 2004 ) , a claim @xmath7 as an @xmath8-measurable random variable such that @xmath9 is @xmath10-integrable , the price process of any claim is given by @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 indicates expectation under the risk - neutral measure and @xmath13 is the discount factor from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "we consider @xmath16 defaultable issuers in a portfolio , and we indicate by @xmath17 the time of default of the @xmath18-th issuer , @xmath19 .    in the following we are going to use credit indices as a reference .",
    "however our results can be extended to different multiname credit swaps ( such as tranches ) mainly through a redefinition of the loss from which protection is sought .",
    "the credit index is a swap contract providing protection against the default of a pool of @xmath16 names , from the beginning of the contract @xmath20 and until maturity @xmath21 .",
    "a spread or premium @xmath22 is paid for the index protection , proportional to an _ outstanding notional _ that diminishes as names in the pool default .",
    "there are two main families of indices .",
    "the _ dow jones i - traxx indices _ represent ( mainly ) the european market .",
    "the _ cdx _",
    "family represent the north american market . in particular , for main indices the portfolio is set up to include only investment grade names ( in fact the main indices are also called _ investment grade indices _ ) , while the crossover indices include names with a lower credit quality . in the cdx family",
    "there is also a _",
    "high yield index _ usually including issuers with credit reliability lower than crossover names .      for a unit of index notional",
    "each name has a notional of @xmath23 .",
    "it is market standard to give index quotations assuming that also the _ recovery rate _ ( @xmath24 ) is the same for all names .",
    "the cumulated loss at @xmath15 is @xmath25 at time @xmath15 the outstanding notional is @xmath26 in a credit index the _ protection leg _ pays , at default times @xmath27 , the corresponding loss @xmath28 , from start date @xmath20 to maturity @xmath21 or until all names have defaulted .",

    "the first simplification for quoting indices is to assume that interest rates are independent of default , so @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the price at @xmath15 of the default - free bond with maturity @xmath14 .",
    "the second simplification introduced for quoting indices is the assumption of _ _ homogeneous portfolio _ _ * * , * * corresponding to assuming that all names have the same credit risk , and consequently the same survival and default probability .",
    "this default probability common to all names is expressed through intensity modelling ( lando ( 1998 ) ) , with a deterministic , time - dependent intensity @xmath54 .",
    "one finally obtains @xmath55 and @xmath56 the default intensity is obtained through calibration to spot indices , with @xmath57 , and then used to compute quotations for forward indices , providing the underlying of credit index options .",
    "credit index options are introduced in the next section . in treating index options",
    "we will not confine ourselves to the simplifying hypotheses used by the market standard for index quotations .",
    "a * *  * * _ payer credit index option _ with inception @xmath58 , strike @xmath22 and exercise date @xmath20 , written on an index with maturity @xmath21 , is a contract giving the right to enter at @xmath20  into an index with final payment at @xmath21 , as a _ protection buyer _  paying a fixed rate @xmath22 , thus entitled to receive protection from losses in the period between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition the protection buyer receives , upon exercise , also the so - called _ front end protection _ , covering the losses from the option inception at time @xmath58 to the exercise date @xmath59 the front end protection and its financial rationale are described below .",
    "the purpose of a credit index option is to allow the protection buyer to lock in a particular premium spread @xmath22 , that the protection buyer has the right ( and not the obligation ) to make effective at a future time .",
    "however , if the above simple payoff was considered without front end protection , there would be an additional side - effect : the option buyer would not be protected from losses in the period between @xmath58 and maturity @xmath20 . in order to attract more investors ,",

    "the index option is priced as a call option on the index spread , and then the value of the front - end protection is added to the option price .",
    "the index spread is defined as the value of @xmath22 that sets the index value @xmath62 to zero , @xmath63 allowing to write the index value as @xmath64 the index option is then priced by decomposing its value as follows @xmath65 \\mathbb{+}\\pi \\left ( f_{t}^{t_{a}}\\right)\\ ] ] and then by expressing the first component through a standard black formula , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the volatility of the forward spread and @xmath68    this standard market approach to pricing the index option has a main flaw , as noticed by pedersen ( 2003 ) .",
    "the above formula neglects the fact that the front end protection is received only upon exercise .",
    "pedersen ( 2003 ) , defines the option payoff as @xmath69 and suggests a numerical integration to compute the expectation of payoff ( [ formula_wrong2_option_payoff ] ) .",
    "the prices of index swaptions computed with pedersen s formula confirm that the standard approach overprices out - of - the money payer options .",
    "pedersen ( 2003 ) results have led to an improved black formula approach , based on the redefinition of the underlying index spread .",
    "the procedure is described for example in doctor and goulden ( 2007 ) .",
    "one defines a _ loss - adjusted _ index spread by taking front end protection into account directly . in fact",
    "the actual underlying of the credit index option is the _ loss - adjusted index _",
    ", @xmath70 thanks to the market standard quotation system , seen in section [ section_forwardindex ] , one has market liquid information available to compute all the above quantities .",
    "so it is natural to give a new spread definition , setting to zero @xmath71 rather than @xmath72 .",
    "this leads to the following _ loss - adjusted market index spread _",
    "@xmath73 that allows to write ( [ formula_wrong2_option_payoff ] ) as @xmath74 now one can think of taking @xmath75 as numeraire and @xmath76 as lognormal underlying variable so as to price the option with the _ market credit index option formula _ : @xmath77 a * *  * * _ receiver credit index option _ with the same contract specifications as the payer above , is a contract giving the right to enter at @xmath20  into the same index with final payment at @xmath21 , as a _ protection seller _  receiving a fixed rate @xmath22 .",
    "following the same steps as above , the payoff is @xmath78 and the price is given by @xmath79",
    "we have seen in the previous section that it appears possible to take front end protection into account correctly without losing the tractability of the market black formula approach .",
    "this is an important issue for building a solid and standardized option market .",
    "a black formula approach is for example the standard for pricing swap options in the interest rate world , as justified by the market model framework introduced by jamshidian ( 1997 ) for swaptions and brace , gatarek and musiela ( 1997 ) for caps . in this pricing approach ,",
    "the complexity of the no - arbitrage dynamics of the underlying asset is consistently transferred to a correct numeraire , through change of measure .",
    "however , the market option formula ( [ formula_wrong2_option_price ] ) does not represent yet a consistent extension of this approach to credit index options .",
    "if one wants to reach a consistent definition of the index spread and a safely arbitrage - free valuation formula , one needs a specific treatment of the information sets involved , which in presence of default portfolios is more subtle than in the default - free case or even the single - name default case .",
    "this is shown in the following .",
    "the approach leading to the market option formula ( [ formula_wrong2_option_price ] ) has highly improved on the initial market approach leading to ( [ formula_wrong1_option_price ] ) .",
    "however , even the most recent approach fails .",
    "the two approaches share the following problems .    1 .",
    "the definition of the spread @xmath76 is not valid globally , but only when the denominator @xmath80\\ ] ] is different from zero .",
    "since @xmath75 is the price of a portfolio of defaultable assets , this quantity may vanish , it is not bounded away from zero in all states of the world having positive probability .",
    "2 .   when @xmath81 the pricing formula ( [ formula_wrong2_option_price ] ) is undefined , while instead we will see that the option price is known exactly in such a scenario . we will see , additionally , that in this scenario the above spread @xmath82 does not set the value of the adjusted index to zero .",
    "since it is not strictly positive , @xmath83 would lead to the definition of a pricing measure not equivalent to the standard risk - neutral measure .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the current literature does not solve these problems .",
    "the only partial exception is jackson ( 2005 ) , that deals with 2 ) while not considering 1 ) and 3 ) . instead",
    ", here we give a solution to the above problems based on the definition of appropriate subfiltrations .",
    "problems similar to those presented in the last section appear also in modelling default of a single name for pricing an option on a credit default swap ( cds ) .",
    "a cds is like an index swap with one single name .",
    "the cds price for protection from @xmath84 and @xmath85 , in a simple formulation neglecting the accrual terms , is @xmath86 -k\\sum_{i = a+1}^{b}\\mathbb{e}^{\\mathbb{q}}\\left [ d(t , t_{i})\\alpha _ { i}\\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\ { \\tau > t_{i}\\right\\ } } \\mathbf{|}% \\mathcal{f}_{t}\\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath87 indicates the default time of the single reference credit entity .",
    "when faced with an option on a cds , it is natural to define the cds equilibrium spread @xmath88 as the level of @xmath22 setting the above price to zero , and to chose as a numeraire for change of measure the single name defaultable present value per basis point @xmath89\\ ] ] however , this is not a viable numeraire since it has zero value in all states of the world where the underlying name defaults before the option maturity , a set with positive measure .",
    "thus , in all such states of the world the above definition of the cds equilibrium spread @xmath88 is not valid .",
    "these problems of single name credit modelling are dealt with by jamshidian ( 2004 ) and brigo ( 2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "although the solution proposed in these works can not be trivially extended to the multiname setting , we recall them in the following since they are the foundations of the results we present here .",
    "jamshidian ( 2004 ) and brigo ( 2005 , 2008 ) make use of a _",
    "subfiltration structure_. following jeanblanc and rutkowski ( 2000 ) , define @xmath90 , where @xmath91 namely the filtration generated by @xmath87 , thus representing default monitoring up to @xmath15 , while @xmath92 is a filtration representing the flow of all information except default itself ( default - free information ) .",
    "a market operator observing only this second filtration can have information on the probability of default but can not say exactly when , or even if , default has happened .",
    "this structure is typical for instance of the cox process setting , where default is defined as the first jump of a cox process .",
    "a cox process is a process that , conditional on the path @xmath93 followed by the stochastic default intensity @xmath94 , is a poisson process of intensity @xmath95 .",
    "this definition hinges on assuming default intensity @xmath94 to be @xmath92-adapted .",
    "however , the use of subfiltrations is not limited to cox processes .",
    "the advantage of subfiltrations in the context of credit option pricing is that a subfiltration structure allows to define pricing formulas in terms of conditional survival probability @xmath96 which can be assumed to be strictly positive in any state of the world ( or at least a.s . ) . in particular",
    "it allows to use a result by jeanblanc and rutkowski ( 2000 ) , based on the definition of conditional expectation .",
    "a defaultable payoff with maturity @xmath14 discounted to @xmath15 , @xmath97 , is a payoff that satisfies @xmath98 allowing us to write the _ jeanblanc and rutkowski formula _ @xmath99 = \\frac{\\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\ { \\tau > t\\right\\ } } } { \\mathbb{q}\\left ( \\tau > t|\\mathcal{h}_{t}\\right ) } \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\mathbf{y}_{t}^{t}|\\mathcal{% h}_{t}\\right ] .",

    "the corporate zero - coupon bonds considered in the cds numeraire definition and the cds itself are defaultable payoffs , whose value goes to zero at default , so we can use ( [ formula_jeanrutk_defaultable ] ) and we can confine ourselves to making assumptions on the stochastic dynamics of the credit spread only on the @xmath104 subfiltration , which is all we need for pricing when @xmath105 .",
    "we do not need to treat explicitly the case @xmath106 since all involved payoffs have in this case a value which is known to be zero .",
    "then , for applying these results to options , we need the option itself to be priced with ( [ formula_jeanrutk_defaultable ] ) , and this is possible because single name credit options are _ knock - out options _ , namely their value is zero after default .",
    "the situation in a multiname setting is different , so it requires a related but different approach , outlined in the next section .      in a multiname",
    "setting we have a plurality of reference entities that can default , so the above subfiltration setting gives us a plurality of possible subfiltrations , @xmath107 so that @xmath108 is the filtration generated by the default time @xmath17 of the name @xmath18 , with @xmath109 while @xmath110 is a filtration representing the flow of all information exceptthe default of the name @xmath18 .",

    "a very natural choice that we propose is to choose @xmath225 with this choice , the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath202 with respect to the risk neutral measure is @xmath226 and trivially coincides with the radon - nikodym derivative computed in section [ section_equivalentmeasure ] .",
    "following theorem 3.8 in jamshidian ( 2004 ) , always with @xmath127 stopping time replacing the single name stopping time @xmath87 , one can check that , with this definition of the pricing measure , the pricing formula for an index option coincides with ( [ formula_optionpricing_beforelognormality ] ) , with the difference that now the pricing measure is @xmath166 defined by ( [ formula_randonnikodym_norestriction ] ) , rather than only the restriction defined by @xmath227 .",
    "the fundamental assumptions used by jamshidian ( 2004 ) for proving this result are that the model is _ complementary _ , namely @xmath228 and _ positive _ , namely @xmath229 for any numeraire @xmath230 .",
    "both properties are natural in our framework .",
    "complementarity has already been explicitly assumed in the model definition , while positivity had been assumed only for the risk neutral measure , but can be with no harm extended to all numeraire measures .",
    "therefore in this setting the pricing formula ( [ formula_optionpricing_beforelognormality ] ) can be expressed through a global , numeraire - based measure .",
    "in the previous part of this work we have provided a rigorous theoretical framework for the pricing of index options , that was missing in the market approach . this has led to replacing the market option formula ( [ formula_wrong2_option_price ] ) with the arbitrage - free option formula ( [ formula_right_option_price ] ) . in this section",
    "we point out that the improvement of the arbitrage - free option formula ( [ formula_right_option_price ] ) on the market option formula ( [ formula_wrong2_option_price ] ) is not limited to the fact that ( [ formula_right_option_price ] ) has a rigorous justification that lacked in the market approach .",
    "indeed , for options on particular portfolios , or for peculiar market situations , the correct accounting of the portfolio armageddon risk avoids painful mistakes in valuation . as a consequence of the crisis that struck credit markets in summer 2007 , related to the burst of the _ subprime _ loans - linked structured finance bubble ,",
    "the market is currently in one of those situations when the correct accounting of the portfolio armageddon risk is crucial . in the following empirical tests we consider market data of march 2007 , before the subprime crisis , market data of august 2007 , in the middle of the crisis , and finally more recent data of december 2007 .",
    "we focus on options on the i - traxx europe crossover index , that have a short maturity ( less than one year ) and have been particularly traded and liquid in recent years . following the jpm quotation terminology , we name call options the options on the receiver side ( that allow an investor to be _ long _ on credit risk ) , and put options the options on the payer side ( that allow an investor to be _ short _ on credit risk ) .      in table 1 and in figures 1 and 2",
    "one sees market quotations for the main reference credit market products .",
    "notice that they include information on index tranches , quoted through the so - called _",
    "base correlation_. in fact the arbitrage - free option formula ( [ formula_right_option_price ] ) introduces an explicit dependence on default correlation information , that instead does not enter directly the market option formula ( [ formula_wrong2_option_price ] ) .",
    "this comes from the definition of the spread in ( [ formula_right_spreaddefinition ] ) and from the @xmath231 component of the option price , that , under the assumption of independence of interest rate and default risk , is @xmath232 it depends on the conditional @xmath120-probability of a portfolio armageddon in @xmath233 $ ] given that there was no armageddon before @xmath15 .",
    "ceteris paribus , an armageddon event will be more likely in a context of higher correlation .",
    "we have included also correlation information from the cdx ( american ) market , since the two credit markets have been historically very close .",
    "l    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +     + table 4 . market bid - ask on quoted index options .    for put options of table 3 ,",
    "price differences appear more moderate , since only for the highest correlation considered ( corresponding to the cdx correlation for cdx exceeded @xmath234 on the last trading week of november 2007 . ] ) the difference exceeds the relevant bid - ask , in spite of the fact that in some cases such differences are higher than 20 bps .",
    "one may reasonably argue that the liquidity of the market in august 2007 was particularly low , and the situation , being the immediate aftermath of an unexpected crisis , was extremely peculiar and not likely to last for any relevant time or to appear again in the market .    in order to verify this argument",
    ", we wait until december 2007 , and we price a 9-month option taking into account the december 06 , 2007 , market situation .",
    "the results appear to belie the above argument . in spite of the slightly lower crossover spreads , the market still discounts a high perceived systemic risk , expressed by extremely high base correlation quotes . as a consequence",
    ", the correct accounting of the market - implied risk - neutral probability of a portfolio armageddon is still very relevant .",
    "this is shown both by call prices , where the differences range from 15% to almost 60% of the market formula price , and by put quotations , where the number of cases when the difference between the two formulas exceeds the available bid - ask is even higher than in august 14 .",
    "this relevant impact on option prices of the risk of a systemic crisis appears one of the possible reasons for the fact that the liquidity in the credit option market , after summer 2007 , is concentrated on the shortest maturities .",
    "we also mention that , although the historical probability of total portfolio default appears clearly negligible when we are considering large portfolios of investment grade issuers ( such as the i - traxx 125-name main index ) , there is evidence in the literature that also this risk is priced , so that its risk - neutral probability is not negligible .",
    "an example is in brigo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where it is shown that the generalized poisson loss model needs to include a jump process associated to an armageddon event , if one wants to price correctly market tranches of different subordination and maturity written on the itraxx main index .    additionally , there is a category of credit portfolio options for which , even in normal market conditions , the probability of the portfolio to be wiped out by defaults is never negligible , even in normal market conditions : it is the case of tranche options , in particular for the most risky equity or mezzanine tranches . for such options , that are often embedded in cancelable tranches ,",
    "this issue is always crucial in all market situations .",
    "thus , for an option on a @xmath235 tranche , using a formula analogous to the arbitrage - free option formula ( [ formula_right_option_price ] ) is fundamental for correct pricing in all market situations . clearly , for a tranche option , the tranched loss @xmath236\\ ] ] must replace the loss @xmath237 and @xmath127 is the first time when @xmath238 .",
    "in this work we have considered three fundamental problems of the standard market approach to the pricing of portfolio credit options : the definition of the index spread is not valid in general , the payoff considered leads to a pricing which is not defined in all states of the world , the candidate numeraire to define a pricing measure is not strictly positive , which would lead to an non - equivalent pricing measure .",
    "we have given to the three problems a general mathematical solution , based on a novel way of modelling the flow of information through the definition of a new subfiltration .",
    "using this subfiltration , we take into account consistently the possibility of default of all names in the portfolio , that is neglected in the standard market approach .",
    "we have shown that , while this mispricing can be negligible for standard options in normal market conditions , it can become highly relevant for less standard options or in stressed market conditions . in particular , we show on 2007 market data that after the subprime credit crisis the mispricing of the market formula compared to the no arbitrage formula we propose has become financially relevant even for the liquid crossover index options .",
    "the definition of an equivalent pricing measure through subfiltrations , and the related results on the dynamics of a well defined portfolio credit spread , lay the foundations of an extension to a multiname credit setting of the no - arbitrage approach known as market models , dating back to brace , gatarek and musiela ( 1997 ) and jamshidian ( 1997 ) .",
    "such extension is considered by jamshidian ( 2004 ) , brigo ( 2005 ) and brigo and morini ( 2005 ) for the case of single name credit products . here ,",
    "instead , we consider the extension to a multiname setting , that is technically from the case of single name modelling , and also shows a different market applicability . in fact the market models approach is characterized by the fact of allowing precise arbitrage - free consistency in the modelling of market rates and spreads , and of requiring information on volatilities and correlations of such rates and spreads .",
    "these features have made the approach very successful in the interest rate derivatives market , but they hardly hold for single name credit derivatives , split among different reference with rare options . instead , the reference itraxx and cdx indices now absorb the larger part of the credit derivative market , providing a reference market from which information for modelling market quantities can be extracted . even after the credit spread rally in summer 2007 , multiname indices experienced a return to trading activity while the single name credit market was still dried out .",
