    "it is known that the light signal carries most of the physical information on the celestial objects and the physical field it passed through ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "part of this information , like e.g.  the distance to the source and its velocity , can be extracted by means of ( classical ) astrometric techniques , but at high - level of accuracy , as demonstrated by esa space mission hipparcos , relativistic effects can not be neglected , and this `` relativistic astrometry '' can be considered part of fundamental physics ( for example , astrometric measurements are one of the natural choices to detect possible deviations from general relativity generated by a scalar field @xmath2 that couples with the metric tensor @xmath3 to generate gravity @xcite , or they were used for a possible attempt at measuring the speed of gravity @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct a model of the celestial sphere using the prescriptions of the general theory of relativity in order to take into account the relativistic effects suffered by light while propagating through the gravitational field of the solar system .",
    "the planned future astrometric experiments set the optimal target accuracy for such models to the micro - arcsecond level . to this level",
    ", it was shown that the light propagation will be affected not only by the mass of the sun and of the other planets but also by their gravitational quadrupole and their translational and rotational motion @xcite .",
    "assuming that the solar system is isolated and it is the only source of gravity , then the accuracy of @xmath4arcsec is achieved by considering terms of the background metric up to the order of @xmath1 ; here @xmath5 is the velocity of light in vacuum and @xmath6 is an average velocity for energy balance . in the solar system",
    "this is of @xmath7 km sec@xmath8 .    in this sense ,",
    "the next generation astrometric missions like gaia , of esa @xcite , and sim , of nasa @xcite , offer a unique opportunity to test our model . on the other hand , the observational error of these satellites",
    "will be pushed to the microarcsecond level ( @xmath9arcsec ) therefore , the need is to implement a model of the celestial sphere and of the observables which is accurate to that order . as a reference , we recall that hipparcos ( of esa ) , the only previous example of a global astrometric mission , had an accuracy of 1  milliarcsecond only .",
    "the construction of a general relativistic many - body astrometric model with the required accuracy is expected to be complicated not only by the mathematical structure of the relativistic equations but also by the numerical methods deployed to implement the model into software code .",
    "therefore it is crucial to have an efficient strategy for testing the model . with this goal in mind",
    ", we had already developed a relativistic astrometric model taking as background geometry the exact ( unperturbed ) schwarzschild solution @xcite .",
    "that model was used as a basic touchstone for comparison in the construction of our many - body model . moreover , since a model limited to the @xmath0 order of accuracy is significantly simpler to handle and test , we decided for a full computer implementation of the @xmath0-model , with the intention to use it as test - ground for the higher order extension , which is our ultimate goal .    finally , it is worth stressing that our aim was not to add to the theory of light propagation , which is well known , but to develop a relativistic astrometric model with a new theoretical approach that treats the light propagation in a curved space - time in such a way that all the possible relativistic perturbations coming from the gravity sources are naturally included in the light - path reconstruction .    in sections  [ sec : metric ] and",
    "[ sec : set - geometry ] , we define the background geometry in a way compatible with our basic physical assumptions . in section  [ sec : light - traj ] we discuss how to handle light propagation through the solar system and provide the differential equations which enable us to reconstruct the light trajectory from a distant star to the observer .",
    "then , in sections  [ sec : incond ] and  [ sec : emtime ] , we define the _ observables _ as the measurements coming from a given satellite and link them to the mathematical boundary conditions needed to integrate the light trajectory . finally , in sections  [ sec : test ] and  [ sec : n - bod - test ]",
    ", we present the test campaign used to validate the model .    in what follows ,",
    "greek indices run from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and latin indices run from @xmath12 to @xmath11 .",
    "the space - time structure which underlies the development of relativistic astrometry must mirror the physical and operational reality experienced by the observer .",
    "the basic step of this project is to identify the background geometry .",
    "our first assumption is that the solar system is isolated ; this means that there are no perturbing bodies intervening between the emitting stars and the solar system boundaries .",
    "it is clear that this assumption may not be fully justified since light rays from distant stars may suffer deflections due to _ microlensing _ induced by intervening bodies ( e.g. , as far as the mission gaia is concerned , we expect nearly 1000 microlensing events along the galactic disk during 5 years @xcite ) ; indeed they could generate systematic errors in the data reduction of the celestial sphere , however , their number is very small as compared to the number of observations ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "furthermore , we know that most of the stars are in a binary system and have proper motion which generates an unsteady gravitational field causing a rotation of the celestial reference frame . however , the rotation coefficients have a temporal variation which amounts to 1 @xmath9arcsec every 20 years , a period much longer than the lifetime of all the future space astrometric missions @xcite .",
    "so we judge that the above cases do not affect the validity of the hypothesis that the solar system is isolated .",
    "a second assumption is that the solar system generates a weak gravitational field .",
    "we can then adopt a quasi - minkowskian coordinate system so that the space - time metric can be written as a perturbation of the minkowski metric @xmath14 , namely : @xmath15 where the @xmath16 describe effects generated by the bodies of the solar system and are _ small _ in the sense that @xmath17 , their spatial variations are of the order of @xmath18 while their time variations are at most of the order @xmath19",
    ". clearly the metric form ( [ eq : met ] ) is preserved under gauge transformations of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "the order of magnitude of the correction terms entering the @xmath16 , is expressed in terms of powers of @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath16 are at least of the order of @xmath0 ( newtonian terms ) hence any higher level of accuracy within the model , is fixed by the power of @xmath21 larger than two that one likes to include in the analysis .    having the above considerations in mind , we choose a solution of einstein s equations of the type : @xmath22 where now the sum is extended to the bodies of the solar system . in this approximation ,",
    "the metric tensor ( [ eq : metsum ] ) has in general a non - vanishing term @xmath23 $ ] and the non - linearity of the gravitational field is confined to terms @xmath24 $ ] in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , in august 2000 the general assembly of the iau stated that a solution like ( [ eq : metsum ] ) has to be adopted to define the reference frames and time scales in the solar system @xcite . at the first post - newtonian level of approximation ,",
    "the metric tensor nearby any planet of the solar system takes the form : @xmath27 with @xmath28 = 1 , 2 , 3 .    in the equations above",
    ", @xmath29 represents a generalization of the newtonian potential and @xmath30 is a vector potential describing the dynamical contribution to the background geometry by the relative motion of the gravitating sources as well as by the peculiarities of their extended structures",
    ". the same form ( [ eq : zelig1 ] ) to ( [ eq : zelig3 ] ) is adopted to describe the metric tensor generated by the whole solar system referring so forth to the barycentric celestial reference system . assuming the space - time to be asymptotically flat , the potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 are a sum of integrals containing terms of gravitational mass and mass - current density . such integrals are taken over the support of each body of the solar system .",
    "it should be stressed here that the linearized form of the metric , in the weak field and slow motion ( @xmath31 ) approximation , is the current support for calculating the ephemerides at the jet propulsion laboratory @xcite , california institute of technology .",
    "a light ray , on its way to the observer from a distant star , first feels the gravitational field of the solar system as a point like mass centered in its barycenter , then , as it gets closer , it feels the gravitational perturbations of the individual bodies of the system . to the order of @xmath0 , the light ray will feel the contributions from the individual mass structures while the effects arising from their relative motion and spin would enter terms of higher order .",
    "since a time derivative adds a factor of the order of @xmath21 , time derivatives of the metric coefficients generate terms at least of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "our third assumption then is that light rays will not feel perturbations of the order o@xmath32 $ ] so , within each integration of the light trajectories , the solar system is approximated in our model to a static , non - rotating and non - expanding gravitating system .",
    "a natural consequence of this assumption is that , along with time variations of the metric , we shall also neglect mixed metric coefficients of type @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , in calculating the background metric coefficients which affects the light signal at each spatial point of its trajectory , we need not to consider the spatial location of the individual gravitational source at the corresponding retarded time .",
    "this does not mean that the positions of the perturbing bodies are considered fixed during the whole integration , but simply that the ephemeris used do not include the retarded time , and that we neglect , to @xmath0 , the effects due to their velocities .",
    "let ( @xmath34 ) be a quasi - minkowskian coordinate system with respect to which the space - time metric takes form ( [ eq : met ] ) ; as stated , the choice to consider only terms up to @xmath0 amounts to assume that space - time is static .",
    "hence there exists a time - like killing vector field @xmath35 , say , along which the physical properties of the space - time do not change and therefore uniquely identifies a time direction . let the coordinate time @xmath36 be a parameter along @xmath37 so that @xmath38 . from the killing equation @xmath39 , where semicolon means covariant derivative with respect to the given metric and round brackets mean",
    "symmetrization , one easily deduces that the congruence @xmath40 of killing lines is , to the required order , vorticity - free .",
    "in fact , denoting as @xmath41 the tensor operator which projects orthogonally to @xmath37 , one finds : @xmath42}\\eta_{\\rho;\\sigma}=o[(v / c)^3]\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the vorticity tensor and square brackets mean anti - symmetrization . a space - time which admits a vorticity - free congruence of lines can be _ foliated",
    "_ , namely it admits a family of three - dimensional space - like hypersurfaces @xmath44 which are everywhere orthogonal to @xmath40 .",
    "it is always possible to choose a coordinate system such that the surfaces @xmath44 have equation @xmath45constant ; in this case the spatial coordinates can be fixed within each slice up to spatial transformations only .",
    "we shall term these surfaces @xmath46 .",
    "let us now consider the unit vector field @xmath47 which is everywhere proportional to @xmath37 , namely @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the normalization factor which assures that @xmath50 ; the associated one - form has components @xmath51",
    "so it is proportional to the gradient of @xmath46 , as expected . through each point of a slice @xmath46 , for any @xmath36",
    ", there goes a time - like curve , orthogonal to @xmath46 and having as tangent a vector of the vector field @xmath52 ; the totality of these curves through all the points of @xmath46 form a non - intersecting family of curves , or a congruence @xmath53 , which identifies a physical observer .",
    "the property of this observer is to be static with respect to the selected coordinate representation , that is the spatial coordinates do not vary along its world - lines .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 on the congruence , such that @xmath55 , is the proper - time of the observer @xmath47 .",
    "we then require that the geometry that each photon _ feels _ before reaching the target is described by metric ( [ eq : met ] ) ; moreover we also require that within each photon travel time the world - lines of the bodies of the solar system belong to the congruence @xmath53 and in particular the barycenter of the solar system is fixed at the origin of the spatial coordinates on each slice , (  [ fig : sswt ] ) . with this choice ,",
    "the observer @xmath52 will be termed _",
    "locally barycentric_. this observer is an essential prerequisite of our relativistic astrometric model because at any space - time point and apart from a position - dependent rescaling of its time rate , it plays the role of the barycentric observer which is located at the origin of the spatial coordinates fixed , as said , at the barycenter of the solar system . before concluding this section ,",
    "let us recall here that the constraints on the metric , namely @xmath56 and @xmath40 being killing and vorticity - free , are gauge invariant only up to the order of @xmath0 .",
    "a photon traveling from a distant star to the observer within the solar system , would see the space - time as a time development of slices of constant @xmath36 .",
    "as stated , we shall treat each light trajectory assuming that the bodies of the solar system were fixed at the spatial position they had at the time of observation , say .",
    "evidently , any subsequent light ray will be considered updating the positions of the bodies of the solar system according to their actual motion .",
    "let us then prepare the way to a suitable treatment of a light ray . let @xmath57 be the operator which projects orthogonally to @xmath47 . because of the unitary condition , the parameter @xmath54 on the trajectories of @xmath47 is not constant on the slices @xmath46 but varies differentially with the position as @xmath58 . since the spatial coordinates @xmath59 are constant along the unique normal going through the point with those coordinates ,",
    "the parameter @xmath54 along it will be function of @xmath36 only ; i.e. @xmath60 . let us now consider a null geodesic @xmath61 with tangent vector field @xmath62 which satisfies the following equations : @xmath63 the latter express respectively the null and the geodesic conditions ; here @xmath64 is a real parameter on @xmath61 and @xmath65 are the connection coefficients of the given metric (  [ fig : sigmalambda ] ) .",
    "assume that the trajectory starts at a point @xmath66 on a slice @xmath67 ( say ) and with spatial coordinates @xmath68 .",
    "the light trajectory will _ end _ at the observation place on a slice @xmath69 and at a point with spatial coordinates @xmath70 .",
    "we remember that the origin of the coordinate system is meant to be the barycenter of the solar system .",
    "the purpose of this work is to determine @xmath68 , namely the coordinates of the star , from a prescribed set of observables .",
    "since our approximation permits a global foliation of the space - time , we find it more convenient for the determination and physical interpretation of the gravitational effects on light propagation , to consider the _ spatial projection _ of the light ray @xmath61 on the slice @xmath69 ; this projection is a curve made of the points of @xmath69 which one gets to by moving along the unique normal through the point of intersection of the light ray with the slice @xmath46 , for any @xmath36 .",
    "this curve , that we denote as @xmath71 , is smooth and has a tangent vector field @xmath72 whose coordinate components are equal to those of the projection of the tangent @xmath73 to the null ray into the rest frame of the local barycentric observer at each of its points , namely @xmath74 ( see  [ app : mapping ] for a mathematical description of this mapping procedure ) .",
    "the vector @xmath72 physically identifies the local line of sight of the local barycentric observer at each space - time point of the light ray trajectory .",
    "indeed , the knowledge of @xmath75 is essential to reconstruct the whole story of the light ray .",
    "the curve @xmath71 will be naturally parametrized by @xmath64 .    from @xmath76",
    ", it follows that : @xmath77 clearly it is @xmath78 showing that @xmath79 lies everywhere on the slice @xmath69 as expected .",
    "since each point of @xmath71 is the image under the above projection operation of a point of @xmath61 at time @xmath36 , it is more convenient to label the points of @xmath71 with the value of the parameter @xmath80 which , as we have already said , uniquely identifies that point on the normal to the slice @xmath46 which contains it . hence , being @xmath81 we define the new tangent vector field : @xmath82 in the same way we denote @xmath83 so that @xmath84 which implies : @xmath85 in what follows we shall denote @xmath86 as @xmath54 .",

    "needed to integrate equation ( [ eq : geodint ] ) , we need both frames ; the observer frame allows us to define the measurements and the barycentric one to express all the coordinate tensorial components .",
    "each measurement is made at a coordinate time @xmath104 when the observer was at a spatial position with respect to the barycenter given by the coordinates @xmath105 .",
    "hence we consider as _ observables _ the angles between the direction of the incoming photon and the three spatial directions of a frame adapted to the observer .",

    "this system requires a set of six boundary conditions and , as said in section  [ sec : incond ] , the natural choice is the three spatial coordinates of the observer at the observation time , and the three components of the vector tangent to the spatial line of sight .",

    "this method was used in the light deflection test . in particular , when we consider only the gravitational field generated by the sun , the total amount of deflection produced beyond 100  au is under @xmath167arcsec level , therefore this distance turns out to be a pretty good choice for stopping the integration .    as a final consideration ,",
    "we mention that the geodesic equations can be adapted to various physical situations ; in fact , as explained in section  [ sec : metric ] , the metric has not been explicited the only requirement being that it takes the form : @xmath168    in our approximation it is @xmath169 so the first step was to verify whether the spatial vectors @xmath170 obtained at each step of integration satisfied this unitarity condition up to the correct order of accuracy of @xmath171 .",
    "the results show that this always happens along the integration path .",
    "the basic test is whether our model satisfies spherical symmetry in the case that the sun is the only source of gravity .",

    "this means that the amount of light deflection measured by an observer in a given position must depend only on the angular distance of the celestial object from the gravitational source .",
