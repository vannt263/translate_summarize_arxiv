    "some of this information , in principle , could be obtained with the use of the data on cosmic ray ( cr ) muon and hadron spectra , provided primary spectra are known with high precision , but that is not the case .",
    "the obvious obstacle here is that at high energies primary cosmic ray ( pcr ) fluxes , measured in direct experiments , themselves are functionals of various interaction parameters plus their accuracy is appreciably affected by additional systematic effects  @xcite . in the series of our papers",
    "@xcite we underlined , that these effects can lead to underestimation of light nuclei fluxes and thus can explain discrepancy between measured and calculated muon fluxes for @xmath0  gev .",
    "preliminary data of atic-2  @xcite , covering the gap between magnetic spectrometer and emulsion chamber experiments , seems to be in concordance with our conclusions , but situation is more complicated in fact , as further consideration will show .",
    "atic-2 slope of proton spectrum @xmath1  @xcite for primary energies below 10  tev is in remarkable contradiction with previously measured values @xmath2 and @xmath3 by runjob  @xcite and jacee  @xcite experiments correspondingly , but this discrepancy is removed by steepening in atic-2 proton spectrum at energies above 10  tev .",
    "these new data were already exploited in extensive calculations of muon and hadron fluxes with number of interaction models at different atmospheric depths and zenith angles in  @xcite where it was shown , that their use allows to get reasonable agreement with the most of the data under appropriate choice of hadronic interaction parameters .",
    "in fact , it is not possible to obtain concordant conclusions on primary spectra or hadronic interactions parameters coming even from much smaller subset of the experimental data . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate this on the basis of analysis of the data on muon flux at vertical direction and only one set of the data on hadron flux of eas - top  @xcite .",
    "first , we use the data of sea - level and underground experiments to obtain conclusions on behavior of muon spectrum at sea - level in the energy range 40  gev10  tev . further we analyze influence of uncertainties in the muon data and interaction parameters on properties of reconstructed primary proton fluxes . and",
    "finally we show , that such different in approach and characteristics interaction models as sibyll  2.1  @xcite and nexus  3.97  @xcite can bring to hardly distinguishable predictions on muon and hadron fluxes .",

    "unfortunately , disagreement between the models in the muon fluxes also appears at energies around 100  gev , thus making impossible precise reconstruction of primary nucleon spectrum for @xmath37  tev .",
    "in fact , in such conditions there are no reasons to rule out any of the models , except qgsjet  01 , which leads to remarkable disagreement with the experiment even in the range of reliable magnetic spectrometers data on pcr and muon spectra .    to find out , why the models differ in the predicted muon fluxes let us consider quite characteristic energy 1.29  tev , where discrepancies between the models reach appreciable values and the data on muons from underground installations are yet quite reliable .",
    "contributions of primary protons to the differential flux of muons of the given energy , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : inclusmu ] show , that spread in muon fluxes between the interaction models is entirely due to uncertainties in the description of @xmath38-spectra in fragmentation region @xmath39 . since inclusive muon flux is sensitive nearly only to the characteristics of the very first primary particle interaction , hence , the harder these spectra are in the particular model , the larger muon intensity its use leads to .",
    "for the lower values of @xmath40 , i.e. for @xmath41  tev , all the models give practically the same muon yields .",
    "as noted above , in view of uncertain situation with primary spectra for @xmath37  tev , one can not give preference to any of the models in comparison with the others .",
    "if to demand the minimal disagreement with the direct measurements data on pcr spectra , then obviously sibyll  2.1 satisfies this requirement the best , or , on the other hand , one could say that it provides the most acceptable description of @xmath38 production spectra in @xmath42-air collisions in fragmentation region .",
    "we shall discuss this affirmation in detail below .",
    "from the previous consideration it is clear , that reconstructed fluxes of protons shall be higher than measured in emulsion chamber experiments , but can be comparable with recently obtained data of atic-2 group  @xcite .",
    "we performed the reconstruction simply by picking up of appropriate primary proton flux parameters in order to minimize deviation of the obtained muon fluxes from the parameterizations  ( [ eq : bogdanova ] ) and ( [ eq : mbogdanova ] ) .",

[",
    "fig : primp ] and in table  [ tab : pp ] one can find the results of this reconstruction , upper and lower lines for each muon spectrum parametrizations in the fig .  [",
    "fig : primp ] correspond to low and high helium flux fits  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the obtained spectra are flatter , than measured by runjob and jacee groups , but , except for qgsjet  01 model , agree well with atic-2 results  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitratio ] shows , that in this case it is possible to achieve agreement with the fitted muon spectrum within 10% , but only sibyll  2.1 reproduces its shape correctly , with other models it is not possible to get right muon spectrum slope variation .",
    "we should also note , that this behavior turned out to be insensitive to the choice of helium flux parametrization . as a result",
    ", there is a dip in the ratio of the muon flux , obtained from fitting of proton spectrum , to the parameterizations  ( [ eq : bogdanova]),([eq : mbogdanova ] ) for energies around 1  tev , where the underground data were already underestimated ( overestimation of muon flux at higher energies does not compensate this effect completely ) , and growth in small energies range , which brings to contradiction with low energy @xmath45  gev data .",
    "parametrization  ( [ eq : mbogdanova ] ) was also projected to make muon spectrum slope variation less sharp , but this lead to problems with its fitting in @xmath46  gev energy range , as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fitratio ] ( right panel ) for sibyll  2.1 and nexus  3.97 models .",
    "the problem with muon spectrum shape matching is better illustrated by upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : primpbr ] , where it is shown , that correct reproduction of muon spectrum for energies below 1  tev with single power law proton spectrum leads to appreciable overestimation of muon flux at higher energies .",
    "there are three possible explanations or solutions of this problem .",
    "first , the discrepancy can be completely removed by choice of appropriate interaction parameters , e.g. similar to those in sibyll  2.1 .",
    "another argument , which can be given is that the data on muon flux for energies above 1  tev are not so definite to claim their inconsistency with the calculations , but it does not look well supported by underground data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : strock ] and calculations  @xcite ) . and",
    "the last possibility is to assume , that primary proton spectrum is not monotonous and either has sharp break or slowly changing exponent @xmath47 .",
    "let us consider the latter assumption , which finds experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite justifications , in more detail .",
    "the results for the simple case with break ( fig .",
    "[ fig : primpbr ] ) , which allows to achieve correct description of muon spectrum shape with right asymptotic and deviation in flux value @xmath48% , show , that small difference between spectra  ( [ eq : bogdanova ] ) and  ( [ eq : mbogdanova ] ) results not only in different proton intensities , but also in break positions .",
    "the latter lies for parametrization  ( [ eq : mbogdanova ] ) in the primary energy range 1015  tev , the change in power index reaches appreciable values up to @xmath49 for qgsjet  01 and qgsjet  ii models ( table  [ tab : pp ] ) .",
    "proton spectra , obtained from muon flux  ( [ eq : mbogdanova ] ) , with qgsjet  ii and nexus  3.97 models are in the best agreement with atic-2 data , while sibyll  2.1 provides intermediate between atic-2 and emulsion chambers experiments slope value .",
    "spectra , reconstructed from parametrization  ( [ eq : bogdanova ] ) , have breaks at 36 tev and in case of qgsjet  ii proton flux poorly agrees with experiments at primary energies around 100  gev . evidently , the latter problems are explained by too low , in comparison with underground data , muon flux and this parametrization is considered here mostly for estimation of sensitivity of primary spectrum features to the choice of reference muon flux .",
    "it is necessary to note , that due to low sensitivity of differential muon flux to helium and heavier groups of primary nuclei it is impossible to derive any conclusions on presence of the break in these pcr components .",
    "for illustration let us consider example of calculations for qgsjet  01 and high helium flux , where the break in proton spectrum is positioned at @xmath50  tev and change of power index is equal to 0.14 ( see table  [ tab : pp ] ) .",
    "introduction of rigidity - dependent break in he spectrum at @xmath51 per nucleus of the same value @xmath52 gives remarkable discrepancy between calculated muon spectrum and parameterization  ( [ eq : mbogdanova ] ) only for energies above 7  tev , which reaches 10% at 20  tev . to correct this asymptotic behavior it suffices to reduce @xmath53 to 0.11 simultaneously for protons and helium without change of the break position , and",
    "thus we get proton spectrum lying well within corridor between parameterizations for high and low helium fits , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : primpbr ] .",
    "hence , this corridor covers all possible cases of he flux behavior ( with or without break ) , provided the helium flux stays within limits , given in  @xcite .    summarizing we can say , that primary proton spectrum shape turns out to be sensitive to the choice of interaction model and allows presence of break at 1015  tev with @xmath54 up to 0.15 , which can be slightly softened though , if to allow presence of the same break in other pcr components spectra .",

    "comparison of our calculations of hadron spectrum for the primary spectra from  @xcite ( high helium flux ) with the recent measurements , performed by eas - top collaboration  @xcite , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eastop ] ( left panel ) . first , let us note the following facts .",
    "below 100  gev all calculated spectra have breaks , caused by non - perfect matching of low - energy interaction model gheisha to the high - energy models .",
    "shape of the measured hadron spectra also breaks at energies above 4  tev and the data become less definite , thus in the forthcoming analysis we are going to consider the data for energies from 129  gev to 4  tev . for these energies",
    "qgsjet  01 , qgsjet  ii and sibyll  2.1 quite reasonably reproduce the shape of the measured hadron spectrum , nexus  3.97 leads to spectrum with almost constant power index .",
    "one can see , that the most consistent description of the data for specified energies provide qgsjet  01 and sibyll  2.1 .",
    "in contrast with the muons there are no energy range , where the models agree on the hadron fluxes and the reasons of this disagreement are not as simply to point out as in the case with muons .",
    "the most important characteristics in this analysis are total inelastic cross section , determining chances of primary particle to survive , shapes of inclusive spectra @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 in the very forward region , responsible for substantial process of leading particles production ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hinclus ] for the listed spectra ) .",
    "let us briefly outline the major conclusions , which one may come to in the given situation .",
    "nexus  3.97 gives the lowest fluxes as of hadrons in total , so of nucleons and mesons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mesnuc_sp ] ) , and this happens in spite of the lowest inelastic cross - section values .",
    "inclusive spectrum @xmath60 immediately helps to figure out , that incident protons in nexus  3.97 have comparably low chances to save most of their energy in collision and this leads to such low nucleon flux , the same can be said about meson flux and production of pions by pions .",
    "similarly , from comparison of the inclusive spectra , it can be easily understood , why qgsjet  ii gives the highest hadron flux .",
    "note , that sibyll  2.1 concedes to qgsjet  ii in hadron intensity mostly because of less effective production of leading neutrons in @xmath42-air collisions and due to the larger total interaction cross - section .",
    "thus , from analysis of the data on hadron flux it is difficult to imply any strict constraints on inclusive spectra shapes , since mechanism of hadron spectrum formation is more sophisticated than that in the case of muon spectrum .",
    "sibyll  2.1 and qgsjet  01 display quite different behaviors of the relevant inclusive spectra and total interaction cross - sections , but both models almost equally succeed in description of the eas - top data ( i.e. produce close hadron fluxes ) .",
    "the given standard approach to analysis of situation , in fact , is of little sense , since it is based on assumption about validity of primary spectra in form of fits from  @xcite , which was called into question in our previous discussion . in this case",
    "it is logical to analyze interaction models self - consistency , i.e. their ability to give correct estimates of several cr components at once .",
    "provided we know behavior of primary proton spectra for every model , required to match the data on muon flux , we may check how these proton spectra agree with the data on hadrons . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eastop ] ( right panel ) we give hadron intensities , calculated for primary proton spectra with breaks from fig .",
    "[ fig : primpbr ] ( for sibyll  2.1 see fig .",
    "[ fig : primp ] ) , corresponding to muon spectrum parametrization  ( [ eq : mbogdanova ] ) . after increase of primary nucleon flux , dictated by the data on muons , one can see ,",
    "that the best agreement with eas - top measurement provide nexus  3.97 and sibyll  2.1",
    ". it would be interesting to note that two models with different philosophies and inclusive spectra give the most self - consistent results on muons and hadrons , but , of course , this conclusion must be taken with much care , since it is based on the single set of data and we have only indirect indications on the accuracy of this set , e.g. such as agreement of primary proton fluxes , obtained by eas - top and kascade teams ( the latter is derived from flux of unaccompanied hadrons  @xcite ) .",
    "if to try to perform the same analysis with the variety of the data , obtained at different atmospheric altitudes and zenith angles , no consistent notions of such kind will be obtained as can be easily seen from calculations , presented in  @xcite .",
    "the progress in cr and high - energy physics , achieved during last 1015 years allowed to turn from statements about satisfactory ( qualitative ) concordance between different kinds of data to investigation of more fine effects . as an example",
    ", we managed to show that reconstructed from the data on vertical muon flux primary proton spectra have not only expected interaction model dependent intensities , but also model - dependent shapes .",
    "it is demonstrated , that application of qgsjet  01 , qgsjet  ii and nexus  3.97 models brings to proton spectrum with break at 1015  tev and power index @xmath47 before break close to that , measured in atic-2 experiment .",
    "nevertheless one can see , that absolute proton flux for qgsjet  01 is hardly compatible with any data of direct experiments , and the break for all these three models is more moderate , compared to what can be inferred from atic-2 data , which though become less definite right in the break region . on the other hand sibyll  2.1 allows to reproduce shape of the muon spectrum with single power law proton spectrum , which is in reasonable agreement with both emulsion chamber and atic-2 data within experimental errors .",
    "further improvement of our understanding of the situation , which is of primary astrophysical interest , can be achieved via experimental study as of muon cr component characteristics with water and ice neutrino telescopes and so of inclusive spectra @xmath61 in fragmentation region .",
    "reduction of uncertainties in the latter component with the use of the data on primary spectra , hadron and muon components , does not look possible , because of 1 ) poor correlation between muon and hadron production mechanisms , 2 ) ambiguity of existing cr experimental data and 3 ) possibility to realize self - consistent description of the data on muons and hadrons with the models , having remarkably differing inclusive spectra and underlying philosophies .",
