    "the information that is available about galaxies primarily relates to their morphology , internal kinematics , and spectral energy distribution .",
    "the further away one goes , the less important become the first two , compared to the third . clearly , if one wants to study galaxy evolution , study of the electromagnetic spectrum is of maximum importance .",
    "since the spectrum of a galaxy generally consists of a combination of stellar spectra , emission from gas , and possibly non - thermal radiation , partly extinguished by dust , and since also stellar spectra exist in a very large number of varieties , it is clear that understanding the spectrum of a galaxy is very difficult .",
    "to study complicated spectra it is necessary to first understand the spectral energy distributions of relatively simple objects .",
    "for this reason we will discuss here a model that analyzes the spectra of early - type galaxies .",
    "these objects appear to contain relatively little dust extinction and gaseous interstellar medium , and to have little recent star formation .",
    "they have , for these reasons , been the most studied objects in the current literature on population synthesis .",
    "there have been a number of accepted ways to attack the problem of understanding the spectrum of an elliptical . to understand why we adopt our current method",
    ", we will summarize shortly some of the population synthesis methods most often used in the literature .",
    "a stellar population synthesis program tries to find a combination of stars for which the integrated spectrum agrees with the observed spectrum of the object under study . in practise",
    "the problem is often underconstrained , i.e. a number of combinations of stars can be found which are able to fit the spectrum . to overcome this problem",
    "one generally forces the solution to obey certain constraints . these range from simple continuity requirements ( e.g. the luminosity function should decrease monotonically ) to the requirement that the distribution of stars is determined completely by stellar evolution calculations .",
    "models with very few physical constraints are generally called _ empirical _ population synthesis models , as opposed to _ evolutionary _ models .",
    "empirical models have been used with some success by spinrad & taylor ( 1971 ) , faber ( 1972 ) , oconnell ( 1976 , 1980 ) and pickles ( 1985 ) .",
    "these papers often make use of linear programming to obtain their results .",
    "some workers , notably bica ( 1988 ) , have attempted to take into account evolutionary effects by using , as units of population , distributions of stars observed in clusters of our galaxy , instead of individual stars .",
    "evolutionary models use a theoretical isochrone or hr diagram , convert isochrone parameters to observed spectra in some way and , finally , integrate along the isochrone .",
    "they all need to make an assumption about which _ initial mass function _ imf to use .",
    "also , the models need a recipe prescribing when the stars have been formed .",
    "since the imf is not very well known at the present time , its treatment is not very different from one model to another . however , as far as the _ star formation rate _ ( sfr ) is concerned , some models assume that all stars are formed at the same time , others prescribe that the sfr has to decrease exponentially with time , while still others explicitly try to describe the whole formation of a galaxy from a gas cloud and form stars when the physical conditions in the gas are adequate .",
    "examples of this kind of evolutionary models can be found in tinsley ( 1968,1972,1978a,1978b,1980 ) , searle _",
    "et al . _ ( 1973 ) , tinsley & gunn ( 1976 ) , turnrose ( 1976 ) , whitford ( 1978 ) , larson & tinsley ( 1978 ) , wu _ et al . _ ( 1980 ) , vandenberg ( 1983 ) , bruzual ( 1983,1992 ) , stetson & harris ( 1988 ) , renzini & buzzoni ( 1986 ) , rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni ( 1987,1988,1990 ) , guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange ( 1987,1990,1991 ) , yoshii & takahara ( 1988 ) , rocca - volmerange ( 1989 ) , buzzoni ( 1989 ) , charlot & bruzual ( 1991 ) , lacey _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) and bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) . some of these models not only predict colors but also line - strengths notably those of peletier ( 1989 ) and worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "there are also models which combine evolutionary population predictions with considerations of chemical evolution .",
    "these models follow the evolution of the gas and make use of isochrones of more than one metallicity ( solar ) .",
    "examples of these _ chemo - evolutionary _ population synthesis models are arimoto & yoshii ( 1986,1987 ) , casuso ( 1991 ) , bressan _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) as well as the model presented in this paper .",
    "note that for this type of models only the global metallicity , z , is normally taken into account to determine the stellar populations .",
    "however it is in principle possible to follow the abundance distribution separately for each of several important elements in the gas .",
    "examples of these so called chemical evolution models can be found in larson ( 1972 ) , matteucci & tornambe ( 1987 ) , tosi ( 1988 ) and there are many more .",
    "however , calculating colors and especially absorption line - strengths in such models has not been attempted up to now .",
    "finally , among this kind of models there are a few which combine chemical evolution with dynamics , e.g. theis , burkert & hensler ( 1992 ) .",
    "one can not say that one type of model is better than another .",
    "in general , more observables and physical parameters can be calculated if one makes more assumptions .",
    "if no assumptions are made about the physics , as in the empirical models , one may end up with solutions that are unphysical .",
    "if however wrong assumptions are made , one will not learn anything about the stellar evolution history either .",
    "we show later in this paper that our results can be reproduced using the _ simple _ analytical model and possibly with infall .",
    "this means that we could have replaced the part of the model that deals with the evolution of the gas by some analytical calculations .",
    "however , we have preferred to build up the numerical machinery , since it offers much more flexibility , and even improved insight .",
    "it is clear that our understanding of all these aspects is improving with time , which means that the models that are to be applied can legitemately be more and more complicated , and in this context we have developed the evolutionary population synthesis code presented in this paper . for the reasons mentioned above it",
    "should never be used as a static black box out from which a theoretical fit to the data is to be taken , but as an evolving tool , which might help in disentangling stellar populations in a composite system .",
    "if one wants to calculate the final spectrum of a galaxy that has evolved from a gas cloud , one has to integrate over time the spectra of all stars that are still _ living _ at the current time .",
    "the number of stars formed at a certain epoch is determined by the star formation rate .",
    "little is known about this , so many models give it a prescribed form , and let it decrease e.g. exponentially . in this paper",
    "we assume that the sfr is proportional to the gas density ( schmidt 1959 ) .",
    "the gas density itself and the chemical evolution of the gas is calculated taking into account the original gas , and the metal - enriched gas that is ejected by stars .",
    "the yields for the various elements needed for this calculation are not especially well known , and better knowledge would significantly improve the model .",
    "other factors that may affect the sfr , such as inflow or outflow , are not considered in the context of the present models .",
    "the stars living at the current epoch contain stellar populations with a mixture of ages and metallicities . to calculate the final spectrum we decompose the stars into single stellar populations ( ssp ) each of a single age and metallicity , and calculate their spectra . to do this",
    ", one needs in the first place theoretical isochrones .",
    "the parameters of the isochrones depend , amongst others , on opacities of ions and molecules , and are reasonably well known for the early stages of stellar evolution .",
    "however for later phases such as the agb and the post - agb , evolutionary calculations are very complicated , and could still benefit from significant improvement .",
    "the isochrones are much better for solar and sub - solar metallicity than for metal rich stars , because the former can be , and have been , tested observationally on globular clusters . in general , the relative composition of the elements heavier than helium in the models is close to solar ; only recently have people included for example oxygen - enhancement ( vandenberg 1992 ) or @xmath0-element enhancement ( weiss _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "the following step is to obtain a spectrum for a star with physical parameters given by the isochrones .",
    "model atmospheres needed for this ( e.g. kurucz 1992 ) appear to be reasonably reliable in the blue . in the red ,",
    "molecular opacities make them , for the time being , much less reliable .",
    "for that reason several authors ( faber _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 , gorgas _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 and worthey _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) have developed a method that depends much more on observations .",
    "they use a grid of observed stars with various theoretical parameters to determine fitting functions that can be used to calculate an absorption line index for any combination of theoretical isochrone parameters .",
    "the problem however is that these fitting functions at the moment are available only for a limited number of absorption lines , since one needs many stars of various types and metallicities to make them .",
    "if one wants to carry out population synthesis , one needs to cover as large a wavelength range as possible , and also at as high a spectral resolution .",
    "this is to cover many colors and line indices , since in principle every color and absorption line is affected in a different way by the parameters above : the sfr , the imf , the metallicity and abundance ratios etc . in practice a model with complete coverage from uv to near - ir is hard to implement , because of lack of fitting functions , color calibrations etc .",
    ", and the observations are hard to obtain . in this paper",
    "we are concentrating on early - type galaxies , for which high spectral resolution is less important , due to their large velocity dispersions .",
    "we have produced model output for colors and lines that are relatively easy to obtain and reproduce , and that allow us to separate effects due to various relevant physical parameters . to some extent",
    "we are limited by the availability of libraries of stars , especially for the fitting functions , so this aspect too , can be significantly improved in the future .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will describe how we obtain colors and absorption line indices for a single stellar population , emphasizing differences from previous studies , and especially any improvements . in section 3",
    "we introduce our chemical evolutionary model . in section 4",
    "we apply our model to a limited set of data from three standard galaxies , for which the data is presented in an accompanying paper ( vazdekis _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , * paper ii * ) .",
    "we perform the fits for an ssp ( the _ static _ option ) and for a full evolutionary case . in section 5",
    "the conclusions are presented .    finally , in paper ii , apart from presenting the observational basis of the data - set used here",
    ", we carry out a comprehensive fit of the whole set of indices and colors on the basis of the scenarios suggested in this paper .",
    "in particular , we compare the fits obtained assuming a single - age single - metallicity stellar population or using the full chemical evolution model .",
    "we also discuss the relations between elements .",
    "the stellar content of a model galaxy calculated by our full evolutionary model consists of stars of various ages and metallicities . in practice its output spectrum is the integrated output of a large number of spectra of stellar populations each with a single age and metallicity ( ssps ) . in effect",
    ", the ssps can be thought of as the building blocks of our stellar population model , although in an evolutionary model these ssps are not independent but linked by physical parameters governing star formation , which makes the evolutionary method intrinsically more meaningful .",
    "many authors , e.g. worthey ( 1994 ) ( hereafter w94 ) , restrict themselves to calculating a single ssp , which is less general , but whose simplicity can give insights in the stellar populations of a galaxy .",
    "we will refer to a single age single metallicity model as the _",
    "static _ case of our stellar population model . in this section",
    "we will explain in detail how integrated colors and line strengths are calculated for this _",
    "static _ case .",
    "this model works as follows .",
    "assuming an age and a metallicity it calculates the present distribution of the stars according to the required isochrone ( see next subsection ) and weights the light of the stars on this isochrone with the assumed imf ( as defined in section 2.2 ) .",
    "then it calculates the integrated colors and absorption lines , weighting each individual contributing star by its luminosity ( as explained in sections 2.3 and 2.4 ) .",
    "we present the results of our model for a grid of ages and metallicities and compare them with the literature .",
    "our models are based on stellar evolution theory and require a set of isochrones to predict the distribution of the stars in the hr diagram at a given time .",
    "in this work we have adopted the large grids of theoretical isochrones provided by bertelli _",
    "( 1994 ) ( hereafter bbcfn ) .",
    "their initial compositions have been chosen according to the empirical law of pagel ( 1989 ) @xmath1 and are [ z=0.0004,y=0.23 ] , [ z=0.001,y=0.23 ] , [ z=0.004,y=0.24 ] , [ z=0.008,y= 0.25 ] , [ z=0.02,y=0.28 ] and [ z=0.05,y=0.352 ] .",
    "all these sets of isochrones were computed using the most recent radiative opacities by iglesias _",
    "( 1992 ) ( opal ) except those of @xmath2 $ ] which are based on models with the radiative opacities by huebner _",
    "et al . _ ( 1977 ) ( laol ) .",
    "these isochrones cover a wide range of ages and of masses , from approximately @xmath3 to @xmath4 and @xmath5 to @xmath6 respectively .",
    "another main advantage in the application of these sets of isochrones is that they cover all the stellar evolutionary stages : from the zams , beyond the red giant tip until the white dwarf stage after the planetary nebula phase . for more details",
    "about these isochrones we refer the reader to bbcfn .",
    "the set of isochrones with @xmath7 can be safely used because the effect of varying from laol to opal opacities at low metallicities has been estimated to be small by alongi _",
    "( 1993 ) ( see also bbcfn ) .      in order to be used in our spectrophotometric stellar population synthesis models ( see next sections ) , the isochrones must contain the following quantities : the age , the initial and the present mass along the isochrone , the effective temperature and the gravity .    because the electronic file with the isochrones provided by the padova group , instead of the initial mass contains the indefinite integral of the imf by number over the mass ( flum ) , as defined in bbcfn",
    ", we first obtain the initial mass by inverting the equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "now , from the initial stellar mass and the mass at a given point on the isochrone , we obtain the gas mass fraction ejected by a star of mass @xmath10 and metallicity @xmath11 until time @xmath12 : @xmath13 ( see section 3.2.1 ) .",
    "since the gravities are not in the electronic data base of the isochrones we have calculated them using : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the stefan - boltzmann and the gravitational constants respectively and @xmath17 is the mass along the isochrone .      as the low - mass limit of the isochrones used",
    "is @xmath18 , we decided to complete them with stars of lower masses .",
    "the reason for this is that , even if these stars do not individually contribute substantially , their integrated light may not be negligible ( see table  5 , above all in the near ir for old systems , in those cases where we require a population model with an imf with high slope .    to complete the lower - mass ms of the isochrones of composition z=0.008 , z=0.02 and z=0.05 we used the results for low - mass stars , for z=0.004 , z=0.01 , z=0.02 and z=0.03 ,",
    "generously provided to us by pols ( private communication ) .",
    "the corresponding tracks for solar composition are described in pols _",
    "these tracks have been calculated using a renewed version ( han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1994 ) of the evolution program of eggleton ( 1973 ) , incorporating an improved equation of state and making use of radiative opacity tables from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) for the low temperatures .",
    "since the stars with masses below @xmath18 are always on the zams and show almost no evolution , it is straightforward to incorporate them into the lower ms via the appropriate isochrones .",
    "however , for the isochrones with metallicity z=0.008 we first linearly interpolated the low - mass stars between z=0.004 and z=0.01 . finally , to complete the low - ms of the super metal rich isochrones ( z=0.05 ) we were forced to extrapolate linearly from the low - mass stars of z=0.02 and z=0.03 . as a test",
    "we see that in the theoretical hr - diagram there is good agreement between stars above ( from bbcfn ) and below @xmath18 .      in this work",

    ", one sees that for each galaxy there are models which fit the data .",
    "in the two diagrams our models seem to fit better than , for example , those by w94 .",
    "looking at the two diagrams one can also see that solar metallicities or larger values are required to fit the observational data for the three galaxies , whatever their ages or their imf slopes .",
    "this result was inferred by ourselves ( casuso _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) from an analysis of the mg@xmath82 index alone .",
    "comparing models by various authors ( see section 2.6 ) we have seen that @xmath42 is a very difficult color to model , due to uncertainties in the color - temperature and color - color transformations for low - mass stars and in our knowledge of advanced stages of stellar evolution . on the other hand",
    "it is also a very sensitive color , due to its large wavelength baseline . in fig .",
    "14 we see that @xmath42 depends considerably on the imf slope @xmath20 .",
    "we consider imf slopes of 1.35 and 2.35 and the two shapes of imf proposed in section 2.2 . in this plot",
    "we see that low - mass stars are important in determining @xmath42 , since there is a substantial difference between the predictions for the unimodal and bimodal imfs , especially for high imfs slopes and greater ages .",
    "therefore the stars with masses below @xmath47 have a non negligible effect , and can make the @xmath42 color redder by @xmath83 for old populations ( see for details section 2.7.1 ) .",
    "finally we see that if one includes a small amount of extinction , which reddens the colors but does not change the line indices , the quality of the fits degrades . in paper",
    "ii we will discuss the fit to the other colors and absorption lines in more detail .      in an exploratory attempt to find an acceptable evolutionary fit to our galaxies",
    "we will focus our attention on various very important observables : the colors @xmath42 and @xmath46 , and the mg@xmath82 and h@xmath22 indices .",
    "we first run models varying the two main parameters ( @xmath20,@xmath84 ) and also the ages assigned to the galaxies .",
    "here we also study the two forms of the imf : the unimodal and the bimodal cases . in all these cases we use an imf slope constant in time in a _ closed - box _ approximation . figs .",
    "15 , 16 and 17 show the model output for the selected observables when we sweep our parameter space . in these plots",
    "one can easily see how our evolutionary scheme of stellar population synthesis can not fit the real data .",
    "in particular we see that the mg@xmath82 index of the models is always too low for given colors .",
    "there is an exception when using extremely steep unimodal imfs for which we can obtain @xmath85 ( independently of the sfr that we use ) but which can not increase as rapidly as the @xmath42 color , due to the coolest very low ms stars .",
    "it is didactically instructive to compare the results of our models with the distribution of stars as a function of the metallicity with those resulting from analytical models . in fig .",
    "18 we show the contributions at the present time of the stars as a function of metallicity and age for some of the best fitting ( although not acceptable ) models , inferred from figs .  15 , 16 and 17 .",
    "we have also plotted some of the so - called _ simple analytical models _ which assume a closed system , initially all metal - free gas and a constant imf ( see the review of audouze & tinsley 1976 ) .",
    "we see that both , the simple models and ours , yield distributions which contain important fractions of low - metallicity stars , explaining the mismatch in the @xmath42 vs. mg@xmath82 .",
    "we are clearly dealing with a version of the g - dwarf problem in which we have to account for the absence of low metallicity stars .",
    "this is why , with our invariant imf models , we can not obtain higher values for mg@xmath82 .",
    "if we choose a low value for @xmath84 to decrease the importance of the first ssps , then we get more or less continuous star formation , and the youngest ssps will be the brightest , and since they are young , their mg@xmath82 will be rather low , even if they are metal - rich .",
    "all this is thoroughly discussed in casuso _",
    "( 1996 ) in which we focused our attention exclusively on the mg@xmath82 index .",
    "if one looks at the results presented in ay86 , one sees that the authors have the same problem , and that they can barely find a solution that fits a typical @xmath45 and @xmath42 for a galaxy .",
    "they would not have been able to fit its mg@xmath82 index with their model .",
    "the previous conclusions are more solid if we look at the h@xmath22 vs. @xmath46 diagram , which can not be fitted either . finally , in figs .",
    "15 and 17 there are a few models , with very low imf slopes , which almost fit the @xmath42 vs. mg@xmath82 diagrams of this set of galaxies .",
    "these models however do not fit the corresponding h@xmath22 vs. @xmath46 diagrams ( see fig .",
    "-1.5 cm -0.5 cm    the fact that the metallicity distribution of our model agrees with the predictions of a simple analytic model does not mean however that the latter are adequate for handling in detail the variations which have in fact occurred in stellar populations , even in less complex systems such as ellipticals .",
    "the present model is much more flexible in including the evolutionary histories of stars ( such as mass loss ) and allows us to understand better the star formation history .",
    "the fact that the stellar frequency distribution with metallicity can be reproduced with an analytical model does however give some support to our procedure .",
    "the key question is now how to build a scenario that produces a dominant old but metal - rich population in our observed galaxies . to tackle this problem , in this paper",
    "we introduce a time dependence in the imf slope as one of the ways which are able to yield a metallicity distribution which is skewed toward higher metallicities",
    ". another would be to include some gaseous infall , but we considered this to be less lively for ellipticals . in the beginning , for a period of time ( @xmath86 ) of @xmath87 , or even less , we favor the production of massive stars ( using an imf with low slope @xmath88 ) , while later mainly low - mass stars are produced ( this imf slope is termed @xmath20 ) .",
    "the first to propose this variable imf scenario was schmidt ( 1963 ) .",
    "it also was analyzed by arnaud _",
    "( 1992 ) , worthey _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) and more recently by elbaz _",
    "( 1995 ) among others .",
    "some authors tackled the problem by keeping the imf slope constant ( with the salpeter index ) , but changing the lower - mass cutoff . in our scenario , at the beginning short - lived massive stars quickly enrich the ism but these stars , at the same time , do not contribute to the light we are observing now .",
    "this light comes essentially from stars created later from metal - rich gas and a steeper imf .",
    "this scenario is plausible physically because :    * it is likely that the central density and temperature were initially , high , which favored high - mass star formation ( see starbursts references ) in these massive galaxies , so that the imf slope could well have been smaller than 1 . *",
    "later , conditions tend towards those of the solar neighborhood , so that @xmath20 becomes larger .    if we do not want to include a specific treatment for the galactic equilibrium between sn rates and the galactic mass - dependent binding energy to predict when gas densities are able to form stars , we have to introduce a phenomenological parameter , which is the duration of this short period in which massive stars were favored . for this purpose",
    "we first plot in fig .",
    "19 the chemical evolution during the first 2 gyr . for flatter imf slopes ( @xmath89 ) for different sfr regimes ( characterized by the @xmath84 coefficients ) .",
    "the results here do not depend very much on whether we choose a unimodal or bimodal imf ( in the latter case the metallicities that are reached are slightly higher ) . because we are limited by the isochrones , which are available only for solar and 2.5 times solar metallicities",
    ", we will analyze those chemical evolution parameters for which the two metallicities are reached in different periods of time : 0.2 , 0.5 1 and 2  gyr .",
    "table  8 summarizes these results .",
    "the main difference for two pairs of chemical evolution models which reach the same metallicity level at this initial period is that for lower @xmath88 the contribution of the earliest ssps to the present light is less important .",
    "the ( @xmath42)-mg@xmath82 diagram is a useful diagnostic , and helps us to check which solutions are reasonable . however , other diagrams such as @xmath46 vs. h@xmath22 serve the same purpose ( see figs .  15 and 16 or figs .  21 and 22 ) .",
    "in figs .  20 , 21 and 22 we plot the diagrams for the models with @xmath84 and @xmath88 which reach a metallicity of 2.5 times solar at @xmath86 following table  8 . focusing our attention on the @xmath42 vs. mg@xmath82 plots we clearly see that with a bimodal imf our data can be fitted better . in these plots",
    "we also find that better fits can be obtained for @xmath90 .",
    "the reason for that is clear : if we extend the initial period of time we need lower sfr coefficients implying that the most recent stellar populations become relatively more important and therefore the mg@xmath82 decreases .",
    "the highest values for the mg@xmath82 index are in fact obtained for @xmath91 . in fig .",
    "23 we detail the different contributions to the present time of some of the most representative fits .",
    "we see that the contribution of the stars with metallicities lower than solar , formed during the very short early stage of the galaxy evolution , is almost negligible ( lower than @xmath92 ) . to illustrate this ,",
    "we have also compared these results with a simple analytic model which yields the same final metallicity as our variable imf model . in the same figure we also plotted an _ analytical infall model",
    "_ , in which metal - free gas enters at a rate assumed to equal the stellar birthrate ( larson 1972 , audouze & tinsley 1976 for a review ) .",
    "we see that this model yields the same results as our numerical variable imf model .",
    "therefore there are two main ways to obtain the required metallicity distributions .",
    "we have chosen a variable imf scenario rather than infall in our numerical models because this would seem to be a more reasonable physical assumption for ellipticals and bulges , whereas long - term infall would clearly be a reasonable assumption for the evolution of the disk population such as that of the solar neighborhood .",
    "finally , since the mg@xmath82 should decrease if we choose models ( @xmath84,@xmath88 ) which reach solar metallicity at @xmath86 we also took @xmath91 to make mg@xmath82 as high as possible .",
    "24 shows that for these models we can not obtain the observed high values .",
    "the sombrero is the only galaxy which seems to be fitted by this level of metallicity for a remaining @xmath20 lower than 1.7 , but this is not a real fit , because with these imf slopes the metallicity continues increasing to reach values higher than z=0.1 and even more , and therefore the resulting observables are not fitted .",
    "ngc  3379 seems to require higher metallicity than solar but not as high as 2.5 times solar , while ngc  4472 seems to be well fitted by a value of 2.5 times solar .",
    "here we should direct our attention to the recent paper of gibson ( 1996 ) in which he criticizes this variable imf scenario .",
    "he constructs a coupled photometric and chemical evolution package based on the predictions for the bimodal star formation / imf scenario of elbaz _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) implementing both the isochrones of w94 and those of bbcfn for single stellar population models .",
    "his models produce @xmath42 colors @xmath93 magnitudes too red compared to data from ellipticals .",
    "we have shown in this section that we can fit the data very well . in our opinion",
    "the reason for the discrepancy found by gibson ( 1996 ) is not due to a variable imf scenario but to the following effects : i ) our method of converting the isochrone parameters to colors gives a bluer @xmath42 , as can be seen for example in fig .  3 for a single stellar population model of 12  gyr and metallicity higher than solar .",
    "ii ) for his calculations gibson ( 1996 ) used a ssp while we have followed the chemical evolution during the whole history of the galaxy using our evolutionary model .",
    "we have developed a stellar population model to apply to early - type galaxies .",
    "it produces optical and near - infrared colors , and absorption line strengths in lines from 4100 - 8800    on the lick system , is applicable to systems of intermediate or old age , and metallicity larger than 0.1 z@xmath94 .",
    "the model is chemo - evolutionary , i.e. it calculates the properties of a stellar system , starting from a primordial gas cloud .",
    "however , it can easily be used to predict the properties of systems with a single age and metallicity .",
    "the model colors and line strengths are determined by integrating stellar observables along theoretical isochrones , in this way obtaining single stellar populations ( ssps ) , and then integrating these ssps over time .",
    "the model uses isochrones with solar metal abundance ratios .",
    "as far as possible empirical calibrations have been used to convert theoretical isochrone values to observables for individual stars .",
    "some properties of the models are :    * extensive comparisons with models from other authors show that there is broad overall agreement in the colors and line strengths .",
    "we have also made independent estimates of the errors in our observables . *",
    "our chemical evolutionary model is in good agreement with arimoto & yoshii ( 1986 ) .",
    "we present optical and ir colors which are likely to be improved as a result of new calibration relations .",
    "also , for the first time , we give integrated line strengths for an evolutionary model .",
    "* we find that for a closed box approximation the most metal rich elliptical galaxies can not be fitted with a single imf that is constant in time . to solve this problem",
    ", we propose a scenario invoking an imf skewed towards high - mass stars during a short , initial period ( smaller than 1 gyr ) , followed by preferential low - mass star formation in the remaining time .",
    "* we have briefly tested the model here by fitting it to a few key colors and line strength indices , using a new data set for 3 standard early - type galaxies . in general ,",
    "satisfactory results are reported .",
    "a much more comprehensive comparison of theory with observations is given in paper ii .",
    "to conclude , we need to make a few statements about the applicability of this model .",
    "given the nature of this type studies , the numbers given in the text will soon cease to be the most accurate possible , because better isochrones become available , or better calibrations linking one parameter to another .",
    "therefore , we will try to update the model as time goes on , and interested people can always obtain the most recent version electronically from the authors .",
    "there are however a few areas in which we think that further effort by the astronomical community is needed to improve models of this kind .",
    "these are :    * we show that absorption line strengths are generally more accurate than integrated colors .",
    "to change this situation better color - color relations are needed , especially for very high and very low metallicities . *",
    "inclusion of more absorption line observations will make this kind of models more useful . especially in the near - uv or near - ir very little work",
    "has been done , except in the region of the ca ii triplet .",
    "more libraries like the one of worthey _",
    "( 1994 ) are urgently needed .",
    "* it looks as if a substantial part of the uncertainties are due to incorrect treatment of the later stages of stellar evolution , such as the agb .",
    "theoretical work in this area would be very valuable .",

    "<S> we have developed a new stellar population synthesis model designed to study early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it provides optical and near - infrared colors , and line indices for 25 absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> it can synthesize single age , single metallicity stellar populations or follow the galaxy through its evolution from an initial gas cloud to the present time . </S>",
    "<S> the model incorporates the new isochrones of the padova group and the latest stellar spectral libraries . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied our model to new data for a set of three early - type galaxies , to find out whether these can be fitted using single - age old metal - rich stellar populations , as is normal practice when one uses other stellar models of this kind . </S>",
    "<S> the model is extensively compared with previous ones in the literature to establish its accuracy as well as the accuracy of this kind of models in general .    </S>",
    "<S> using the evolutionary version of the model we find that we can not fit the most metal - rich elliptical galaxies if we keep the imf constant and do not allow infall of gas . </S>",
    "<S> we do however reproduce the results of arimoto & yoshii ( 1986 ) for the evolution of the gas , and produce colors , and , for the first time with this type of models , absorption line - strengths . </S>",
    "<S> it is in fact possible to fit the data for the elliptical galaxies by varying the imf with time . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical model is in good broad agreement with the analytical _ </S>",
    "<S> simple model_. we prefer however to calculate the evolution of the gas numerically instead of using the _ simple model _ </S>",
    "<S> , since it offers more flexibility , and even improved insight , when comparing with observations . in the present paper we describe the model , and compare a few key observables with new data for three early - type _ standard _ galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however the data , as well as our fits , will be discussed in much more detail in a second paper ( vazdekis _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 1996 ) , where some conclusions will be drawn about elliptical galaxies on the basis of this model .    23truecm </S>"
