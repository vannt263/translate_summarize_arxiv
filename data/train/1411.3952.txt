    "the discovery of superconductivity with high transition temperature @xmath7 in iron pnictide compounds@xcite has triggered a reexamination of the basic theoretical assumptions about the electronic structure of the copper oxide superconductors,@xcite based on the similarities and differences between the two classes of materials .",
    "the role and strength of electronic correlations in high - temperature superconductors is a much debated , but still not completely settled issue .",
    "one of the fundamental problems in the theoretical description of a correlated material is the downfolding of the full many - electron hamiltonian into a low - energy model with a few orbitals believed to be most relevant for the origin of superconductivity . in the case of the cuprates",
    ", it is generally agreed that the most relevant orbitals are those that span the two - dimensional copper oxide layers , namely , cu @xmath8 and o @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbitals , although models that include the apical o @xmath11 as well as cu @xmath12 orbitals have also been considered.@xcite two prominent low - energy models are the one - band model consisting of only the strongly hybridized anti - bonding combination of cu @xmath8 and o @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbitals and a three - band model which also includes the bonding combination of @xmath8 and @xmath13 and the non - bonding @xmath6 orbital , also known as the emery model.@xcite since the stoichiometric compounds are usually classified as charge - transfer insulators , a proper description of the low - energy properties should involve the cu @xmath8 and two oxygen @xmath14 orbitals .",
    "a physically well - motivated representation of the underlying one - particle band structure of these models can be constructed by a tight - binding fit to the _ ab - initio _ band structure calculated from the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "since the coulomb interaction among the @xmath0 electrons is so large that a nonperturbative treatment of the correlation effects is needed , an interaction term is then added on top of the one - particle hamiltonian leading to the hubbard model with an effective interaction @xmath15 .",
    "the material - specific determination of the hubbard @xmath15 is , however , a subtle and complicated task .",
    "it can be shown that a reduction of the hamiltonian to a low - energy model necessitates the introduction of a frequency - dependent @xmath15 reflecting the retarded electron - electron interaction resulting from the elimination of the high - energy portion of the original hamiltonian .",
    "in other words , the frequency - dependent @xmath15 incorporates the effects of the high - energy component of the hamiltonian which has been projected out in the low - energy model .",
    "a large body of theoretical studies on the cuprates can be found in the literature .",
    "several recent works employed a combination of density functional calculations in the local density approximation and dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft ) in order to investigate one - band and three - band models of undoped cuprates .",
    "the issues discussed in these works are the importance of antiferromagnetism in opening a gap , or its effect on the gap size,@xcite the proper choice of the @xmath0-@xmath6 level splitting@xcite and the difference of the electronic structure of la@xmath16cuo@xmath17 in the t and t crystal structures.@xcite it was also shown that the interatomic interaction between @xmath6 and @xmath0 electrons plays an important role in stabilizing the charge - transfer insulator state , and therefore needs to be considered at least at the hartree level.@xcite while some of these studies used realistic bandstructures , the interaction parameters were chosen in an ad - hoc fashion and as far as we know , all low - energy models for the cuprates considered so far have neglected the effects of the frequency dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "the calculation of the coulomb matrix elements in a wannier basis corresponding to the low - energy subspace ( here the one - band or three - band model ) is possible using the constrainded random phase approximation ( crpa).@xcite this formalism yields interaction parameters which vary from a static value of a few ev ( significantly smaller than the values typically adopted in previous studies ) to bare interactions of the order of 20 ev at high frequency . the importance of properly treating this frequency dependence has been pointed out in previous papers,@xcite but not for the cuprates . as we will show , the screening effect in high-@xmath1 cuprates is remarkably strong .",
    "there are even recent experimental studies which suggest a connection between screening and @xmath1.@xcite    four issues will be addressed in the present work : first , what is the role of the frequency - dependent @xmath15 ? second , is a one - band model sufficient to describe the low - energy electronic structure of the undoped cuprates ?",
    "third , what is the role of the interaction between the cu @xmath0 and o @xmath6 electrons that is usually neglected in most studies ?",
    "fourth , do ab - initio calculations support the conventional classification of undoped cuprates as charge - transfer insulators ?",
    "the third issue has recently been considered in a model study based on adjustable , static interaction parameters.@xcite here , we focus on the prototypical high-@xmath1 material la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 which has been thoroughly investigated both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite our strategy is to perform a true \" _ ab - initio _ simulation of the electronic structure of la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , as accurately as possible with current technology , and to check if it gives a faithful representation of the low - energy electronic properties . to take into account electron correlations",
    ", we use the dmft method and solve the impurity problem with dynamic @xmath15 using a continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) algorithm .",
    "in addition to the _ ab - initio _ bandstructure we also use the corresponding _ ab - initio _ interaction parameters @xmath15 obtained from the crpa method .",
    "we find that _ ab - initio _ calculations which neglect the frequency dependence of this interaction fail to produce an insulating solution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the frequency dependence of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction is taken into account , a three - band simulation based on _ ab - initio _ interaction parameters produces an insulator with a gap size in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ method ] discusses the methods used to derive the low - energy models ( one - band and three - band ) and the lda+dmft approach used to solve these models .",
    "section  [ results ] shows the spectral functions obtained for la@xmath16cuo@xmath3 using either the static values of the estimated coulomb interactions , or the frequency dependent @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction .",
    "section  [ summary ] is a summary and conclusion .",
    "figure [ band ] shows the lda bandstructure as well as the bandstructures of the effective low energy one- and three - band models .",
    "the lda bandstructure was computed with the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) code @xmath18 @xcite and the model subspaces were defined using symmetry constrained maximally localized wannier functions as implemented in the @xmath19 library.@xcite the effective one - band model consists of a single orbital of @xmath8 character at each cu site . for the three - band model we increase the model subspace to include also the two in - plane wannier orbitals of o @xmath20 character .",
    "it should be noted that , although the conduction bands look very similar in the two cases the wannier functions corresponding to the cu @xmath8 orbitals are very different . in the one - band case",
    "the cu - centred wannier function is constructed as a linear combination of only a few bands close to the fermi energy .",
    "this leads to less variational freedom and hence much more delocalized wannier functions than in the three - band case , where more states are used to construct the wannier functions . hence , while in the one - band case there is a one to one correspondance between the conduction band and the @xmath8-like wannier function spanning the correlated subspace , this is not the case for the three - band model . in the three - band model",
    "the conduction band can be interpreted as the antibonding combination of the @xmath6 and @xmath0 states and the two valence bands can be interpreted as the bonding and nonbonding combinations .",
    "therefore , although the main @xmath0-weight is in the conduction band , there is also a small @xmath0-weight in the valence bands as can be seen in the right panel of fig .",

    "the symmetry points are defined as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . ]",
    "we compute the frequency - dependent interaction parameters for the one - band and three - band model using crpa.@xcite in this scheme , the polarization function @xmath24 is calculated in the random phase approximation , i.e. by considering only the bubble diagrams with lda propagators .",
    "this polarization function relates the bare interaction @xmath25 and the fully screened coulomb interaction @xmath26 via @xmath27 one then defines a polarization @xmath28 associated with transitions between states defined in the low - energy bands .",
    "since these transitions will be treated explicitly in the dmft calculation , we remove these screening processes in the calculation of the effective interaction . for this ,",
    "one computes @xmath29 and the frequency - dependent @xmath30 which satisfies @xmath31 apparently , the screening of @xmath30 by @xmath28 gives the fully screened interaction @xmath26 .",
    "one thus interprets @xmath30 as an effective frequency - dependent interaction among electrons residing in the low energy subspace defining the hilbert space of the low - energy model .",
    "this so - called hubbard @xmath15 can also be obtained by solving the following equation:@xmath32 or schematically @xmath33^{-1}v$ ] .",
    "the frequency - dependent interaction parameters of the model are then given by the matrix elements of @xmath30 in the wannier basis @xmath34 constructed using the procedure of marzari and vanderbilt:@xcite    @xmath35    while the application of this procedure to the one - band model is unambiguous , the three - band case is more subtle . here , the subset of screening processes which should be excluded depends on how the three - band model is solved .",
    "if we were to solve the full three - band model , we would simply remove all screening processes within the model and no ambiguity would arise .",
    "it would , however , lead to a multi - site impurity problem involving not only the copper site but also the oxygen sites and orbital - dependent @xmath30 . at present",
    "it is not possible to perform dmft calculations for such a complex problem . in this work",
    ", we will treat the @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions within dmft , and the @xmath6-@xmath6 and @xmath6-@xmath0 interactions at the hartree level ( similar to ref .  ) . in this case",
    ", only the @xmath0-@xmath0 screening needs to be removed in the calculation of @xmath15 since we do not include @xmath6-@xmath0 screening processes in the model . according to the discussion in the previous section , the main @xmath0-weight is in the conduction band .",
    "we therefore remove only the screening within the conduction band also for the three - band model .",

    "( [ u ] ) is then the same as in the one - band model but the matrix elements of @xmath15 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ umat ] ) representing the interaction between @xmath0-electrons will nevertheless be different from the one - band case , because the wannier orbitals of the three - band model are significantly more localized .",
    "the lda calculation and crpa downfolding lead to a low energy effective model with one or three bands and dynamically screened ( retarded ) intra- and inter - orbital interactions . to solve this model",
    ", we use the dmft method.@xcite this approximation maps the lattice problem onto a single - orbital anderson impurity model with a dynamical interaction @xmath37 , i.e. an electron - boson problem with a holstein - like coupling to a continuum of bosonic modes.@xcite using the hybridization - expansion monte carlo method,@xcite this impurity problem can be solved efficiently and without approximations on the imaginary axis , yielding the impurity green s function @xmath38 and the impurity self - energy @xmath39 .    in the one - band model , we approximate the lattice self - energy @xmath40 by @xmath39 and compute the local lattice green s function as @xmath41^{-1}.\\ ] ] here , the @xmath42-integral is normalized over the brillouin zone , and @xmath43 is the conduction band dispersion .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath44 is adjusted to ensure one @xmath0-electron per unit cell , so we do not need a double counting term \" to remove the hartree - type self - energy contribution which is already included at the lda level .",
    "the three - band case needs some justification .",
    "let us start with the hamiltonian with a static @xmath45 given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the tight - binding hamiltonian for the three - band model and @xmath49 and @xmath50 label the copper and oxygen sites , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath6 bands are filled , correlation effects among @xmath6 electrons are expected to be small and the lda bands should be quite reliable .",
    "the impurity problem is therefore solved only for the copper site and since we do not consider @xmath6 to @xmath0 screening channels in the model , the effective interaction @xmath51 must include these @xmath6-@xmath0 screening processes and therefore corresponds to the one - band model , albeit evaluated with the more localized wannier functions of the three - band model , as discussed earlier .",
    "we now take into account the frequency dependence of @xmath51 and solve the impurity problem with a dynamic @xmath51 using the ct - qmc method within the action formalism . in the three - band case ,",
    "we consider , in addition to the local self - energy @xmath52 the @xmath6-@xmath6 and @xmath6-@xmath0 interactions at the hartree level .",
    "we thus have to add double counting terms @xmath53 , which as in ref .",
    "we evaluate with the lda densities for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 contributions .",
    "this amounts to adjusting the hartree self - energies ( which are included in the lda ) to the self - consistently computed densities . for @xmath56",
    ", we use a standard double - counting term@xcite evaluated with the correlated density @xmath57.@xcite specifically , the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath58 are @xmath59 and the off - diagonal elements are set to zero .",
    "the factor of four in the last term of @xmath60 is due to the presence of four nearest oxygen atoms around a copper atom and the factor of two in the last term of @xmath61 is due to the presence of two nearest copper atoms around an oxygen atom .",
    "note that in the hartree - like terms , we use the screened interactions .",
    "while this can be justified in the case of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction,@xcite it is an approximation for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 terms which should be considered as a lower bound estimate . at present , it is unclear how the frequency - dependence should be incorporated into a static description if the screening modes for different interation terms are different .    with this approximate self - energy",

    "we can employ the same strategy to analytically continue the self - energy .",
    "for this , we first compute a green s function @xmath73 with a suitably chosen @xmath74 and apply the above procedure to obtain the corresponding spectral function @xmath75 and ( using the kramers - kronig transformation ) the green s function @xmath76 . the real - frequency self - energy , including high - energy features ,",

    "the static ( screened ) interaction is @xmath80 ev . the imaginary part of @xmath15 , which describes the excitation spectrum of the system excluding contributions from the model , is characterized by several collective excitations : a broad peak centered at @xmath81 ev and a sharp peak at @xmath82 ev , as well as smaller peaks around @xmath83 and @xmath84 ev .",
    "the broad peak corresponds to a collective plasmon excitation that is coupled to single - particle excitations providing decaying channels responsible for the broad feature .",
    "the pole - like structure around @xmath82 ev may be interpreted as a collective subplasmon excitation arising from single - particle transitions from the occupied oxygen @xmath6 bands to the unoccupied part of the anti - bonding @xmath8 band . at very high - energy above the plasmon frequency , screening becomes ineffective and the interaction approaches the bare coulomb interaction value of @xmath85 ev .    in the three - band case , the structures of the frequency - dependent @xmath51 interaction look similar to the one - band case but the static value is @xmath86 ev , while the high frequency limit is about 30 ev .",
    "these higher values result from the more localized wannier orbitals because , as explained previously , @xmath51 is calculated as a matrix element of the @xmath36 of the one - band model",

    "are calculated as matrix elements of the _ same _ @xmath36 , the presence of a strong peak in @xmath92 but not in @xmath93 and @xmath94 implies that the collective excitation corresponding to the @xmath4 ev peak is not extended , as in usual plasmon - like excitations , but rather localized on the copper site .",
    "this suggests that the screening mechanism of a hole or a test charge created at the copper site will be rather different from the screening mechanism at the oxygen sites .",
    "an additional screening charge fluctuation associated with the @xmath4 ev peak is present in response to a hole created at the copper site but not at the oxygen sites . for hgba@xmath16cuo@xmath17 , another high-@xmath95 cuprate compound",

    "this indicates that the localized @xmath6-@xmath0 excitation at @xmath4 ev might be a universal feature of the cuprate compounds .",

    ", @xmath98 is remarkably low .",
    "for the one - band model , we find @xmath99 and for the three - band model @xmath100 .",

    "we first discuss the results obtained for the one - band model .",
    "figure  [ dos_oneband ] shows the local @xmath0-electron spectral function obtained with the frequency - dependent interaction ( blue line ) and with the static interaction @xmath104 ( dashed black curve ) .",
    "the calculations have been performed at temperature @xmath105 in the paramagnetic phase , and we use the analytical continuation procedure described in sec .  [ maxent ] .",
    "we see that the static interaction is not enough to open a mott gap in the spectral function , whereas the calculation with the full @xmath37 yields a gap .",
    "however , the gapsize of @xmath106 ev is too small compared to the experimentally measured optical gap of 2 ev.@xcite apart from this low - energy region , the spectra differ mainly at high energies . here , the dynamic-@xmath15 spectrum features satellites at energies of approximately @xmath107-@xmath89 ev and a broad plasmon peak centered around @xmath108 ev .",

    "this calculation also produces a gap , confirming the importance of the frequency dependence of @xmath15 in renormalizing the band width .",
    "in the three - band calculations , we also find that static interactions equal to the static limit of the _ ab - initio _ estimated interaction parameters are not enough to open a gap in the spectral function ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ dos ] ) .",

    "[ dos ] , if the frequency - dependence of @xmath51 is considered , an insulating solution is found , with a gap of @xmath109 ev .",
    "this is in rather good agreement with the experimentally measured gap .",
    "( our use of the static screened interactions in the hartree terms implies that this calculation yields a lower bound for the gap size . ) furthermore , since the calculations have been performed in the paramagnetic phase , the gap opening confirms that the insulating nature of la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is of mott - hubbard rather than slater type .",
    "we also find , in agreement with ref .",
    ", that the interatomic hartree potential is essential : without the corresponding shift in the relative @xmath6-@xmath0 level splitting , the frequency - dependent @xmath51 would not be enough to open a mott gap .",
    "in contrast to the one - band result , the @xmath0-spectral function from the three - band calculation is strongly asymmetric , due to the hybridization with the @xmath6-states which lie below the fermi energy .",

    "furthermore , due to the self - consistent adjustment of the @xmath6-@xmath0 level splitting via the hartree contribution in eqs .",
    "( [ hartree1 ] ) and ( [ hartree2 ] ) , which is affected by the smaller @xmath114 in the dynamic-@xmath15 calculation , the @xmath6-states are pushed down in energy , so that there is a strong @xmath6-@xmath0 hybridization in the energy range where we expect the lower hubbard band .    to shed some light on the satellite issue , we plot in fig .

    "it is this latter feature which should be associated with the lower hubbard band . the comparison with fig .",
    "[ dos ] shows that this hubbard band ( which is somewhat more asymmetric in the spectrum based on the analytical continuation of @xmath115 ) overlaps with the @xmath6 states , so that the lower hubbard band is partially masked by @xmath0 spectral weight originating from @xmath6-@xmath0 hybridization . on the other hand , the hump seen in the energy range from -10 to -15 ev , as well as the peak centered around + 10 ev ,",
    "should be considered satellite features which result from the frequency dependence of the hubbard-@xmath15 in the effective low - energy model .",
    "the position of the satallite feature around -13 ev is in good agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra in ref .  .",
    "to reveal the lower hubbard band , it is instructive to look at the momentum resolved spectral function . in fig .",
    "[ dos_band ] , we plot the @xmath6 and @xmath0 spectral functions along the same path as in fig .",
    "besides the weakly dispersing upper hubbard band we find a similarly dispersing band in the energy range from @xmath116 to @xmath117 ev .",
    "the states near the band edge , which have a strong overlap with @xmath6 states , may be identified with zhang - rice singlets . in the same region of momentum space",
    ", one finds an almost dispersionless band at @xmath118 ev , which also exhibits a strong overlap with @xmath6 states .",
    "this energy is suggestive because it corresponds to the screened @xmath51 , and the chemical potential is at the upper gap edge .",
    "however , a comparison with the lda bandstructure in fig .  [ band ] and the @xmath6 spectral function shows that this feature in the @xmath0 spectral function can be naturally interpreted as originating from the hybridization with a renormalized @xmath6 band .",
    "hence , it appears that the @xmath0 states which may be associated with the lower hubbard band cover a broad energy range up to the gap edge , and that the zhang - rice band should be considered a substructure of the lower hubbard band .",
    "since the lower hubbard band covers the same energy range as the @xmath6 states , and the structure near @xmath5 ev ( visible as a grey band in the bottom panel of fig .  [ dos_band ] ) is a satellite , our calculation is not consistent with a simple charge - transfer insulator picture , in which the hubbard band lies below the @xmath6-states .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fully screened interaction @xmath119 is dominated by two strong peaks at energies @xmath120 and @xmath4 ev which signal the formation of many - body or collective states with those binding energies ( fig .",
    "comparison with @xmath92 for the one - band or three - band model allows us to conclude that the peak at @xmath120 ev in @xmath119 originates from collective excitations within the @xmath8 band since the peak is missing in @xmath92 .",

    "must necessarily be carried over to @xmath122 and in turn inherited by the spectral function .",
    "structures in the spectral function must therefore reflect structures in @xmath121 .",
    "one interesting but yet unresolved issue is the relation between these peaks in @xmath121 and the hubbard bands .",
    "if the screened interaction @xmath123 were computed fully self - consistently , and not by crpa , transitions across the gap would contribute to the low - energy screening , so that we can expect a feature in @xmath124 at an energy corresponding to this gap .",
    "there is however a priori no reason why the crpa @xmath123 , which is derived from the lda bandstructure , should exhibit these structures . whether the agreement between the gap size in fig .  [ dos_fromg ] and the sharp peak in @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ w ] is a mere conincidence , or if the corresponding properties of the bandstructure ( used in the dmft calculation ) play a role in fixing the size of the mott or charge transfer gap is an interesting open question .",
    "we now consider the long - debated question to what extent the one - band model is able to represent the electronic structure of the three - band model and whether the one - band model is sufficient to describe the low - energy physics .",
    "the wannier orbitals in the one - band model are extended objects with both @xmath6- and @xmath0-character .",
    "hence , the lower hubbard band in this model should not be considered as simply a @xmath110 state , but rather as a representative of the zhang - rice and lower hubbard bands found in the three - band calculation .",
    "conversely , the upper hubbard band in the one - band case is not simply a @xmath111 state , but an excitation which has no simple correspondence in the three - band calculation .",
    "if we consider the zhang - rice singlet band a substructure of the lower hubbard band , we should compare the separation between the hubbard bands in the one - band calculation to the separation between upper hubbard band and the zhang - rice band in the three - orbital model , rather than to the 7 ev gap between the low - energy hump in the lower hubbard band and the upper hubbard band . in this case , the agreement between the spectra seems acceptable , given the difference in localization between the wannier orbitals .",
    "of course , the one - band calculation can not reproduce the strong asymmetry of the three - orbital model @xmath0-spectral function , which originates from the presence of the oxygen bands .",
    "also , the gap size is too small , since the calculation does not take into account the effect of @xmath55 , which is essential in fixing the @xmath6-@xmath0 level splitting in the three - band calculation .",
    "we have constructed low - energy one - band and three - band models for la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 from first - principles .",
    "the one - particle band structure was based on the lda and the frequency - dependent effective interaction ( dynamic @xmath15 ) was calculated using the crpa method . in both models",
    "lda+dmft calculations using a static @xmath15 taken as the zero frequency limit of the dynamic @xmath15 do not yield the expected insulating gap .",
    "it is necessary to take into account the frequency - dependent @xmath15 in order to open up a gap in the spectrum .",
    "this clearly shows the crucial role of dynamical sceening in a correct description of the insulating state of la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and in obtaining a consistent picture of the low - energy electronic structure . in agreement with ref .",
    "we have also found that it is important to take into account the change in the inter - atomic hartree potential , which is neglected in most dmft calculations , to get the correct position of the oxygen @xmath6 band relative to the @xmath0 band .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 states which should be identified with the lower hubbard band cover the same energy range as the @xmath6 states , and that the zhang - rice band should be considered a substructure of the lower hubbard band .",
    "in addition two pronounced collective excitations embodied in the fully screened interaction @xmath123 were observed at @xmath126 and @xmath4 ev .",
    "the peak at @xmath120 ev can be traced back to a collective plasmon - like excitation arising from particle - hole excitations within the antibonding @xmath0 band whereas the @xmath4 ev peak corresponds to a collective excitation originating from transitions between the occupied oxygen @xmath6 bands and the antibonding @xmath0 band .",
    "the peak at @xmath4 ev is responsible for the very strong screening effect in la@xmath16cuo@xmath127 .",
    "it also gives rise to satellites in the spectral function at @xmath5 and @xmath128 ev .",
    "the peak at @xmath5 ev that may look like the lower hubbard band is in fact a subplasmon satellite associated with the @xmath6-to-@xmath0 transitions . the true lower hubbard band is partially masked by the oxygen @xmath6 bands at a lower binding energy .",
    "comparison between the spectral functions of the one- and three - band models reveals that the one - band model is not sufficient to describe the electronic structure within the energy range of the gap .",
    "the size of the gap of the one - band model is significantly smaller than that of the three - band model , where the latter value of @xmath109 ev is in very good agreement with the experimentally measured data of @xmath129 ev .",
    "it is also quite evident that the one - band model can not properly describe the true character of the top of the valence band , which is of the type @xmath110 ligand hole , rather than a simple lower hubbard band splitting off the antibonding @xmath0 band .",
    "while our calculation is based on the _ ab - initio _ bandstructure , uses _ ab - initio _ interaction parameters , and takes into account the @xmath6-@xmath0 interaction ( at the hartree level ) , one missing ingredient is the momentum - dependence of the self - energy .",
    "it has been found in recent studies that the strong band renormalization from the dynamical @xmath15 is at least partially compensated by a band - widening due to the @xmath42-depdendence of the self - energy.@xcite quantifying these effects for la@xmath16cuo@xmath17 requires more advanced schemes , such as cluster extensions of dmft ( which can not be easily combined with the most efficient techniques for treating frequency dependent @xmath15 ) , or gw+dmft ( which may not properly capture the @xmath42-dependence in strongly correlated compounds@xcite ) .",
    "exploring these issues will be an interesting topic for future studies .",
    "we thank p. hansmann for helpful discussions .",
    "the dmft simulations have been run on the brutus cluster at eth zurich , using a code based on alps.@xcite pw has been supported by snsf grant no .",
    "200021 - 140648 and nccr marvel .",
    "some of this research has been carried out during a stay at esi ( vienna ) .",
