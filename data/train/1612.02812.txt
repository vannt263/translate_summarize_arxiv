    "as communicable diseases spread in our societies , people frequently turn to the internet to search for medical information . in recent years",
    ", multiple research teams have investigated how to utilize internet users search activity to track infectious diseases around our planet . in this article , we show that a methodology , originally developed to track flu in the us , can be extended to improve dengue surveillance in multiple countries / regions where dengue has been observed in the last several years .",
    "our result suggests that our methodology performs best in dengue - endemic areas with high number of yearly cases and with sustained seasonal incidence .",
    "dengue fever poses a growing health and economic problem throughout the tropical and sub - tropical world .",
    "dengue is today one of the fastest - growing and most important mosquito - borne viral diseases in the world , with an estimated 390 million dengue infections each year and threatening an estimated 3.9 billion people in 128 countries @xcite .",
    "infection often causes high fever and joint pain , and severe cases can lead to hemorrhage , shock and death .",
    "dengue epidemics strain health services and lead to massive economic losses .",
    "dengue mortality and morbidity both need to be addressed to reduce this heavy burden .",
    "the world health organization has called for better early case detection among other tactics to reduce dengue mortality , and to reduce dengue morbidity through improved outbreak prediction and detection through coordinated epidemiological and entomological surveillance .",
    "however , a comprehensive , effective and reliable disease surveillance system for dengue is not yet available .",
    "governments traditionally rely on hospital - based reporting , a method that is often lagged and limited with frequent post - hoc revisions , due to communication inefficiencies across local and national agencies and the time needed to aggregate information from the clinical to the state level @xcite .",
    "this lack of timely information limits the identification and optimization of effective interventions .",
    "measurement difficulties are compounded by the fact that a majority of dengue cases are asymptomatic @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "building an effective disease surveillance tool is essential to being able to identify and assess the severity of dengue outbreaks and to enable better assessment of the effectiveness of ongoing interventions .",
    "such tool(s ) should provide accurate and consistent measures of regional or national infection levels , be updated in near real - time , and be immune to bureaucratic or resource - related delays . to improve accuracy , these tools should use and link together multiple sources of information , using both traditional and non - traditional sources .    over the years",
    ", a broad range of traditional epidemiological methods have been proposed by research teams to fill this time gap of information by supplementing official case counts with now - cast predictions using historical dengue incidence data from previous seasons .",
    "autoregressive models , such as seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average ( sarima ) model , that take into account historical and seasonal patterns , have been shown to produce useful disease estimates , some including additional variables such as concurrent weather information @xcite .",
    "other studies have further examined climate - driven models , finding associations of seasonal and long - term weather patterns such as el nio with dengue levels in various countries @xcite .",
    "in addition , various mechanistic models on the dynamics of dengue transmission have also been explored , with some recent promise @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive survey of these methods are given in andraud et al .",
    "@xcite    in parallel and complementary to the aforementioned methodologies , the global spread of the internet has opened up the opportunity to investigate whether users activity patterns on internet search - engines and social media platforms may lead to reasonable estimates of dengue infection levels @xcite . in theory ,",
    "internet search tracking is consistent , efficient , and reflects real - time population trends , giving it strong potential to supplement current epidemiological methods @xcite .",
    "studies have previously demonstrated the feasibility of using internet search data to track dengue case counts @xcite .",
    "google dengue trends ( gdt ) , launched in 2011 , was one of the first tools to quantitatively track dengue activity in multiple regions throughout the world by leveraging the aggregate google search patterns of millions of users @xcite . since its start",
    ", the methodology behind gdt has been updated to address flaws found in its sister effort , google flu trends @xcite , before finally being discontinued in august 2015 .",
    "an assessment of gdt in mexico showed mixed prediction accuracy compared to official case counts , with strong correlation in some states @xcite .    despite progress in the use of both dengue historical information ( time series approaches @xcite ) and real - time internet searches for dengue tracking @xcite , an approach for accurate tracking of dengue by combining the respective strengths of each data source",
    "has not been documented to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we extend a methodology recently introduced in the flu surveillance literature , to combine dengue - related google searches with historical dengue case counts to track dengue activity .",
    "specifically , we evaluate the predictive performance of the argo model , as introduced in @xcite , to track dengue in five countries / regions around the globe : mexico , brazil , thailand , singapore , and taiwan .",
    "our contribution shows that the lessons learned to track influenza in data - rich environments , like the united states , can be used to develop methodologies to track an often - neglected tropical disease , dengue , in data - poor environments .",
    "we used two kinds of data sets for our study : ( a ) historical dengue incidence from government - led health agencies and ( b ) google search fractions of dengue - related queries , aggregated at the national - level .",

    "consequently , we used the google trends tool to identify the top ten queries most highly correlated with the term ` dengue ' in each country , ignoring terms unrelated to dengue .",
    "the monthly aggregated search fractions were then downloaded within the time period of interest for each country .",
    "the query terms used for each country in this study are presented in table s1 , in the supporting material .",
    "we used the multivariate linear regression modeling framework argo ( autoregressive model with google search queries as exogenous variables)@xcite , previously used to track flu incidence using flu - related google searches , to combine information from historical dengue case counts and dengue - related google search frequencies with the goal of estimating dengue activity one month ahead of the publication of official local health reports .",
    "argo uses a training set that consists of a two - year moving time window ( immediately prior to the month of prediction ) and an @xmath0 regularization approach , to identify the best performing parsimonious model @xcite .",
    "this moving window approach allows the model to constantly improve its predictive ability by capturing the changing relationship between internet search behavior and dengue activity .",

    "log_-transformed google search frequency of query term @xmath5 at time @xmath3 .",
    "our argo model , derived from a hidden markov model , is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the set of auto - regressive lags , @xmath8 is the set of google query terms , and @xmath9 can be thought of as the exogenous variables to time series @xmath10 as introduced in @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath7 consists of the most recent 12 months and the month exactly two years ago .",
    "such choice of @xmath7 captures the influence of short and mid - term yearly fluctuations , as well as long - term seasonality previously shown to have strong predictive power in dengue @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath12 , corresponding to the top ten dengue - related search terms as described in the data subsection .",
    "we impose @xmath0 regularity for parameter estimation . in a given month , the goal is to find parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 that minimize @xmath16 where @xmath17 are regularization hyper - parameters .    for a given time window , argo automatically selects the most relevant variables to generate an out - of - sample dengue activity estimate .",
    "this is achieved by zeroing out regression coefficients of terms that contribute little ( or have redundant information ) to the prediction .",
    "this approach leads to interpretable results by allowing us to clearly identify which variables had a role in the prediction for each month or week of prediction .",
    "all statistical analyses were performed with r , version 3.2.4 .      for comparison with argo ,",
    "we included prediction results from five alternative methods .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "google dengue trends @xcite , which ended in august 2015 .",
    "data are obtained from https://www.google.org / flutrends / about/. because google dengue trends reported dengue intensity in a scale from 0 to 1 , we dynamically rescaled it using a sliding training window to recreate case estimates .",
    "2 .   penalized multivariate linear regression model with google trends information only @xcite , denoted as gt .",
    "this is essentially argo without autoregressive lags , and incorporates a common @xmath0 penalty on the google trends data ; 3 .",
    "seasonal autoregressive model , denoted as sar , using a time series of the most recent 3 lags , as well as 2 seasonal lags .",
    "specifically , the monthly time series model is comprised of time lags 1,2,3,12,24 : @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "4 .   seasonal autoregressive model with google dengue trends as exogenous variable , denoted as sar+gdt .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath19 .",
    "naive method , which simply uses the case count at the previous month as the prediction for the value of the current month .    all benchmark models ( except the naive method ) were trained by linear regression with sliding two year windows for fair comparison .",
    "we used five accuracy metrics to compare model performance : root mean squared error ( rmse ) , mean absolute error ( mae ) , root mean squared percentage error ( rmspe ) , mean absolute percentage error ( mape ) , and pearson correlation .    mathematically , these accuracy metrics of estimator @xmath21 for target dengue case count @xmath22 are defined as , @xmath23^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ^ 2\\right\\}^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath26 .",
    "retrospective out - of - sample estimates of dengue case counts were generated for each country using argo and the five benchmark models , assuming we only had access to information available at the time of prediction .",
    "the time windows in which we assessed the performance of our dengue estimates for each country were chosen based on the availability of official and gdt benchmark data .",
    "these time windows are : brazil from mar 2006  dec 2012 , mexico from mar 2006  aug 2015 , thailand from oct 2010  aug 2015 , singapore from feb 2008  aug 2015 , and taiwan from jan 2013  mar 2016 .",
    "in four of the five countries / regions , brazil , mexico , thailand and singapore , argo outperformed all benchmark models across essentially all accuracy metrics ( rmse , mae , rmspe , mape , correlation ) . see tab .",
    "[ tab : err ] .",
    "in particular , by incorporating information from the internet searches and the historical dengue cases , argo achieved better results than using either information alone .",
    "this accuracy improvement is reflected in the accurate predictions during peaks of dengue activity and bounded estimates during off - season / periods with low levels of infection .",
    "[ fig : prediction ] .",
    "unlike the seasonal autoregression with gdt model ( sar+gdt ) , argo avoided the significant overshooting problem that has been previously noted in google trends data ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is especially notable between 2006 - 2008 and 2012 - 2014 in mexico , and 2006 - 2010 in brazil .",
    "taiwan shows notably different results .",
    "of all the available models , the naive and seasonal autoregression models have the best performance , but neither is clearly effective .",
    "the naive model has the lowest rmse and mae , but the worst rmspe , mape and correlation , while the seasonal model shows the best rmspe , mape and correlation . in comparison ,",
    "the other models have a much greater rmse to mae ratio , indicating worse performance during high prevalence relative to the naive model .",
    "argo does not outperform the benchmarks in this case .",
    "this result seems to reflect the distinct case count pattern in taiwan compared to the other countries .",
    "taiwan experienced little to no dengue prevalence for years until two epidemic spikes occurred in 2014 and 2015 .",
    "in contrast , the other countries experience seasonal fluctuations of dengue over their entire prediction windows .",
    "this lack of predictability may be the reason that both seasonal and google information - based models have greater error than the naive model , significantly over - predicting the 2015 peak for example .",
    "yet overall , these methods show greater correlation than the naive method , perhaps because they are more responsive . because argo over - predicts to a greater extent than the autoregressive methodology , this again reflects previous observations on the tendency of google data to overshoot .",
    ".*comparison of argo to benchmark models across countries and evaluation metrics * the bold face value is the best value among all methods according to each performance metric .",
    "google dengue trends was not published for taiwan and therefore the gdt benchmark is not available for taiwan .",
