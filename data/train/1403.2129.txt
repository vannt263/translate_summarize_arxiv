    "observations have shown that there exists a supermassive black hole , sgr a * , located at the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the mass of the black hole is about @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . because of its proximity , sgr a *",
    "is regarded as the best laboratory of studying black hole accretion .",
    "numerous observations have been conducted and abundant data has been obtained ( see recent reviews by @xcite ; falcke & markoff 2013 ; yuan & narayan 2014 ) .",
    "the source is quite dim currently , with a bolometric luminosity of only about @xmath3 .",
    "the mass accretion rate at the bondi radius has been estimated by combining the _ chandra _ observation and the bondi accretion theory , which is @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity would be 5 orders of magnitude higher if the accretion were in the mode of the standard thin disk .",
    "amount of theoretical studies in the past 20 years have revealed that the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) can explain this puzzle ( @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the low - luminosity of sgr a * is because of two reasons .",
    "one is the intrinsic low radiative efficiency of adaf because of energy advection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another important reason is because of the existence of strong wind ( or outflow ) , i.e. , @xmath5 of the matter captured at the bondi radius are lost ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of wind has been confirmed by the radio polarization observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and more recently by the _ chandra _ observation to the emission lines from the accretion flow in sgr a * ( @xcite ) .",
    "yuan & narayan ( 2014 ) presented the most recent review on the hot accretion flow and its various astrophysical applications , including on sgr a*.    one particularly interesting thing is that many observational evidences show that the activity of sgr a * was very likely much stronger in the past than the current stage .",
    "these observations suggest that sgr a * has perhaps undergone multiple past epochs of enhanced activity on different timescales . here",
    "we only focus on relatively long timescales .",
    "these evidences were summarized in @xcite , and later discussed in other works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these evidences include : 1 ) orders of magnitude higher x - ray luminosity ( compared to the present value ) required to explain the fluorescent x - ray emission reflected from cold iron atoms in the giant molecular cloud sgr b2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 2 ) a new x - ray reflection nebula associated with sgr c detected by _ asca _ ( @xcite ) ; 3 ) the ionized halo surrounding sgr a * ( maeda et al . 2002 ) ; 4 ) galactic center lobe ( gcl , @xcite ) ; 5 ) expanding molecular ring ( emr , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 6 ) north polar spur ( nps , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 7 ) the 8 kev diffuse x - ray emission in the center ( @xcite ) ; 8) the excess of h@xmath6 emission of magellanic stream ( @xcite ) ; 9 ) the _ suzaku _ observations to the nps ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that to explain the former seven observations mentioned above , the characteristic x - ray luminosity of sgr a * should be @xmath7 several hundred years ago , and such an activity should last for @xmath1 yr .",
    "for such a luminosity , the accretion should be well in the regime of hot accretion rather than the standard thin disk ( yuan & narayan 2014 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the mass accretion rate should be @xmath0 times higher than the present value ( @xcite ) .",
    "other possibilities of the past activity have also been proposed .",
    "for example , the bolometric luminosity in the past millions years estimated by @xcite based on the 8th evidence mentioned above is much higher , @xmath8 .",
    "the timescale of the activity is shorter , and it was active 1@xmath93 myr ago .",
    "yet another possibility is as follows .",
    "a star formation event has been observed and it is believed to occur at @xmath10 yr ago on scales of @xmath11 0.03@xmath90.5 pc from the smbh ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . if the past activity of sgr a * occur concurrently with this event , this would imply a strong activity of sgr a * occurred @xmath12 myr ago ( @xcite ) . in summary , so far we still lack a consensus on the past activity of sgr a*.    yet perhaps another evidence for the past activity of sgr a * is the _ fermi _ bubbles recently detected . using the _ fermi_-lat",
    ", @xcite discovered two giant gamma - ray bubbles located above and below the galactic plane ( also refer to @xcite for the recent observations ) . in galactic coordinates ( l ,",
    "b ) , the height of each bubble is about @xmath13 , and the width is about @xmath14 . the surface brightness looks uniform , and the edge looks sharp .",
    "the total luminosity of the bubbles is @xmath15 in 1@xmath9100 gev band .",
    "the total energy of the two bubbles is estimated to be @xmath16 erg .",
    "many theoretical models have been proposed since the discovery of the _ fermi _ bubbles . in the `` hadronic '' model , the formation",
    "is explained as due to a population of relic cosmic ray protons injected by processes associated with extremely long time scale and high areal density star formation in the galactic center ( @xcite ) . in the `` leptonic '' scenario",
    "the @xmath17-ray emission comes from the inverse compton scattering between relativistic electrons ( also often called as cosmic ray ) and seed photons .",
    "the seed photons may be the cosmic microwave background , but the origin of relativistic electrons are different in different models .",
    "they can come from fermi-1st order acceleration on shock front formed in the periodic star capture processes by sgr a * ( @xcite ) , the fermi-2nd order acceleration through stochastic scattering by plasma instabilities ( @xcite ) , directly from the jet ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or from outflows driven by the past star formation ( @xcite ) .    among these models ,",
    "there are two models which are physically most relevant to the model we propose in the present paper .",
    "they are the `` jet '' model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the `` quasar outflow '' model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the former",
    ", it is suggested that the bubbles are created by agn jet which happened about 2 myr ago .",
    "after that , cosmic rays ( crs ) carried by jet diffuse to today s morphology .",
    "yang et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2013 ) developed the jet model by including magnetic field .",
    "they showed that the suppression of the diffusion of crs along the direction across the edge is caused by the magnetic field configuration .",
    "this is because inside the bubbles , the magnetic field is mainly radial , but just outside of the bubble and close to the edge , the field is mainly in the parallel direction .",
    "one problem , as pointed out by @xcite , is that they must require the jet direction to be perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy , which seems to be unlikely , given the general absence of correlation between the direction of jets and galaxy planes and the observed direction of the stellar disk in the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the velocity required in the jet model is as low as @xmath18 and the mass loss rate in the jet is in general as high as super - eddington .",
    "another model is the `` quasar outflow '' model proposed in @xcite and @xcite . in this model , sgr a * is again assumed to be very active in the past , with mildly super - eddington accretion rate 6 myr ago and duration of the activity being 1 myr .",
    "under such a high luminosity , quasi - spherical outflow will be driven by the strong radiation pressure from this quasar ( @xcite ) , which can result in the formation of the _ fermi _ bubbles . in this model",
    ", the existence of the well - known central molecular zone ( cmz ) in the gc region plays an important role in collimating the outflow and forming the morphology of the bubbles .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the expansion velocity derived by the _",
    "suzaku _ observation is lower than the advocated values by both the jet and quasar outflow models by a factor of 5 and 2 respectively .",
    "assuming that sgr a * was in an active state as suggested by totani ( 2006 ) , in this paper we investigate whether the _ fermi _ bubbles can be inflated by the wind launched from the hot accretion flow by performing numerical simulations . in  2 , we briefly introduce some background on the accretion flow and wind , and present an analytical solution for the interaction between the winds and ism to be used to understand our numerical simulation results . the numerical simulations approach and the results",
    "are presented in  3 and  4 , respectively .",
    "we then summarize in  5 .",
    "the accretion flow in sgr a * in the current stage is relatively simple , namely the whole accretion flow is hot , ranging from the bondi radius to the black hole horizon .",
    "however , if the accretion rate is @xmath0 higher , as estimated by totani ( 2006 ) , this simple picture needs to be modified .",
    "numerous observational and theoretical studies have shown that the accretion flow should consist of an outer thin disk and an inner hot accretion flow . the boundary between the truncated thin disk and the hot accretion flow is called the transition radius ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "some works have been done on the physical mechanism of the transition .",
    "although this question is still not completely solved , we now have a consensus that the value of @xmath19 should decrease with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "this is supported by the modeling to some low - luminosity agns and the hard state of black hole x - ray binaries , which is summarized in @xcite .    for hot accretion flow ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is a function of radius because of the mass loss in the wind throughout the disk ( refer to  [ wind ] ) .",
    "the current net mass accretion rate at the horizon of the black hole and at the bondi radius are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ( @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath22 is defined as the eddington accretion rate . according to @xcite , the mass accretion rate close to the horizon of black hole in sgr a * should be @xmath23 during the past @xmath24 yr . for this value of accretion rate ,",
    "given the theoretical uncertainty , @xmath25 would be a reasonable assumption , here @xmath26 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole .",
    "note that there is some uncertainty in the value of @xmath19 .",
    "the mass accretion rate at @xmath25 is set to be @xmath27 in our favored model .",
    "this value is @xmath28 times higher than the present value , well within the range obtained in @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned in  1 , one characteristic feature of hot accretion flow is that it is subject to strong wind .",
    "the existence of wind has been suggested in @xcite and later by @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic ( hd ) and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulation works by @xcite and @xcite showed that the mass inflow rate of the accretion flow decreases inward , which can be regarded as the pioneer works in the quantitative study of winds from hot accretion flow .",
    "this result is confirmed by many other subsequent works ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "it was soon shown that the physical reason for the inward decrease of inflow rate is because of mass loss in wind which occurs in a wide range of radius throughout the accretion flow ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the physical mechanism for the production of winds",
    "is found to be the combination of magnetocentrifugal force and the gradient of gas and magnetic pressure ( @xcite ; yuan et al . in preparation ) .",
    "while the existence of wind is evident , consensus on some quantitative features of the wind have not been reached .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that the mass flux of wind should be significant , comparable to the mass flux of inflow .",
    "this is much larger than the lower limit obtained in @xcite . in this work , we follow @xcite and assume that at @xmath19 , the mass flux of wind is roughly equal to the inflow rate there , i.e. , @xmath29 in most of our models except for runs `` g '' and `` h '' ( refer to table 1 ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) also estimated the terminal radial velocity of wind based on the conservation of the value of bernoulli parameter @xmath30 and found it is roughly half of the keplerian velocity at @xmath19 .",
    "however , that estimation should be regarded as the lower limit since magnetic field is not included in the analysis . our more recent study find that @xmath30 actually increases along the streamline when magnetic field is included ( yuan et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) . in the present work we set the velocity of the wind to be @xmath31",
    "our simulations indicate that there is some degeneracy between the mass flux and the velocity of winds .",
    "what really matters is the power of winds . the mass flux and velocity adopted above correspond to the power of wind @xmath32 .",
    "the next wind parameter is their angular distribution . in",
    "spherical coordinate , yuan et al .",
    "( in preparation ) find that winds occupy a region @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "given that the range is quite large , combining with the possibility that during the long timescale of @xmath24 yr the rotation axis of the accretion flow may have changed with time , in the present work , we simply assume that the winds are blown out isotropically .    winds may also be launched from the truncated thin disk outside of @xmath19 .",
    "but the details of this process is poorly investigated at present . in this work",
    ", we assume that this part of wind is not important compared to the winds from the inner hot accretion flow .",
    "this is the main uncertainty of our model .",
    "the winds launched from the hot accretion flow are usually supersonic so they will interact with the interstellar medium and produce shocks . before we present the details of our simulation results , in this part we present some analytical solutions to this problem based on some simplifications , which is helpful to understanding our simulation results . here",
    "we assume a simple shock model formed by an isotropic wind punching into an isotropic distribution of interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "it is well - known that the region can be divided into the following four parts : 1 ) high speed wind ; 2 ) shocked wind ; 3 ) shocked ism ; 4 ) un - shocked ism gas .",
    "the interface between the shocked wind and shocked ism is called the contact discontinuity ( cd ) . in our case , since the cooling timescale of shocked winds is longer than the flow timescale , the shocked wind is a `` energy - driven '' flow rather than `` momentum - driven '' flow ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that the forward shock velocity @xmath35 is equal to the velocity of the shocked ism ( @xmath36 ) and the shocked ism region is so thin that @xmath37 , approximately we can obtain the following equations ( e.g. , @xcite , weaver et al . 1977 ) : @xmath38      e_{b}\\approx \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}_{2 } \\cdot \\frac{3}{2 } p_{b } ,   \\\\ % [ 1em ]      \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mc \\rdot2)=4\\pi r^{2}_2 p_{b } ,   \\\\ % [ 1em ]      \\mc=\\int^{r_{2}}_{0 } \\rho_{\\texttt{ism } } 4\\pi r^{2}dr ,   \\\\ % [ 1em ]      p_{w}=\\frac{1}{2}\\mdotw v^{2}.    \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , @xmath39 is the total energy of shocked wind , in which the internal energy is dominant , @xmath40 is the kinetic power of the un - shocked wind , @xmath41 is the gas pressure of shocked wind . in the case of weak shock , the shock velocity @xmath35 will be significantly higher than the velocity of the shocked ism , so our approximations may introduce large errors . assuming @xmath42 , in which _ a _ and _ n _ are both constants and @xmath43 , the solutions of the above equations are : @xmath44    p_{b}(t)=g(a , n)\\cdot p_{w}^{\\frac{2-n}{5-n } } t^{-\\frac{n+4}{5-n } } , \\label{equ_p } \\\\ % [ 1em ]    f(a , n)=\\left[\\frac{(5-n)^{3}(3-n)}{14\\pi a(7 - 2n)(11-n)}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{5-n } } , \\label{equ_rfan } \\\\    g(a , n)=\\frac{3a(7 - 2n)}{(5-n)^{2}(3-n)}\\cdot f(a , n)^{2-n}.   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , @xmath45 is the radii of the forward shock , and roughly it can be used to represent the radii of cd .",
    "here we have neglected the gravity .",
    "this is because in our case the work done by overcoming the gravity is one order of magnitude lower than the injected energy from sgr a*. our solution of @xmath45 is similar to the energy - driven solution in @xcite .",

    "the region of shocked ism is the `` surrounding region '' . when magnetic field is included , the field lines in this region will be aligned with the cd , which prevents the diffusion of relativistic electrons across the bubble edge .",
    "this then explains why the edge of the bubbles is so sharp ( @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism also applies to our model since in reality magnetic field should exist .",
    "if we only want to explain the morphology of the bubbles , we find that we have relatively large freedom in terms of the values of velocity and mass flux of winds .",
    "for example , we can use a smaller wind velocity and a higher mass outflow rate ( see model g , or fig .",
    "[ label8 ] ) , or a larger wind velocity and a lower mass outflow rate to get the `` correct '' morphology .",
    "however , observations put additional constraints , such as temperature .",
    "we choose run a as our `` basic run '' because not only the morphology but also other properties of the bubbles are consistent with observations . in run",
    "a , winds need to last for 12.3 myr to get the `` correct '' morphology of the bubbles , as shown by fig .",
    "[ label1 ] .",
    "the height and width of the bubble are 8 kpc and 7 kpc respectively , which corresponding to a projected bubble with a latitude of @xmath13 and a longitude of @xmath13 .",
    "although the wind is set to be injected isotropically , the massive cmz surrounding sgr a * blocks the lateral movement of winds , and forces them to move upwards .",
    "in other words , the cmz successfully collimates the wind to the perpendicular direction of the galactic plane .",
    "this is why we can obtain a bubble with narrow waist near the galactic plane , instead of a hemispherical bubble buckling on the galactic plane .",
    "we have tried to explore when the activity of sgr a * quenched and entered into the quiescent state by running `` run b '' .",
    "we find that only if the quiescent time is shorter than 0.2 myr , the result will not be affected , i.e. , showing a significant conical structure in x - ray band with latitude @xmath125 ( see lower panels in fig . [ label3 ] ) .",
    "because the quiescent timescale is so short compared with the age of _ fermi _ bubbles , although in all other runs in this work sgr a * do not enter into the quiescent state as it should be , our simulation results will not be affected .      for run a",
    ", the total energy injected by sgr a * is about @xmath126 erg .",
    "this energy is comparable to the injected energy from galactic center estimated from some observations to some structures , such as the nps structure , gcl , and emr ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total internal energy of _ fermi _ bubbles in our simulation is @xmath127 erg , which is consistent with the observational value .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the _ fermi _ bubbles is only @xmath128 erg , much smaller than the internal energy .",
    "this is because the speed of the gas inside the bubble is subsonic .",
    "the total mass inside the bubble is about a few times @xmath129 , which is much lower than the estimation of @xmath130 based on the assumed upper - limit of an average density @xmath131 @xmath97 in @xcite .",
    "this is because the density in our simulation is about three orders of magnitudes lower than the assumed value in @xcite , as shown by fig .",
    "[ plot2 ] .",
    "we have the following comments to this `` discrepancy '' .",
    "firstly , our observational constraint on the density is poor , thus the total mass of @xmath130 is subject to a large uncertainty .",
    "secondly , since the coefficient of thermal conductivity adopted in our work is low , we may have underestimated the evaporation process which may play an important role in transporting mass from the surrounding gas , including cmz and shocked ism , into the bubbles .",
    "thirdly , we assume the ism homogeneous for simplicity , while in reality the ism is likely to be clumpy .",
    "the dense clouds may be difficult to be blown away by winds so they will stay inside the bubble , which will significantly increase the mass of the gas within the bubbles .",
    "the temperature of the gas is determined by the following equation : t= , where @xmath132 is temperature , @xmath49 is the molecular weight , which is 0.61 for solar composition .",
    "temperatures of different runs are given in table 2 .",
    "in general , the temperature inside the bubble is several times @xmath72 k. although there are some new results of milky way s hot halo recently , the temperature inside the _ fermi _ bubbles is still lack of data .",
    "so our result can be regarded as a prediction .",
    "we will discuss the temperature in the surrounding region between the cd and the forward shock in  4.3 .",
    "we have calculated the predicted x - ray image by considering the bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "[ label3 ] shows the result .",
    "we can see that the morphology is consistent with the limb - brightened x - ray structure obtained in _",
    "rosat _ observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this structure corresponds to the shocked ism . here",
    ", we only calculate the bremsstrahlung radiation , so our images are only for qualitative comparison .",
    "the temperature inside the bubble is two orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding region while the density is two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "therefore the outer region is much brighter than the interior of the bubbles in x - ray band .",
    "recent _ suzaku _ observations have revealed that the temperature of the surrounding region in high latitude ( @xmath133 ) is around 0.3 kev and the thermal pressure is @xmath134 dyn @xmath135 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our model is in good consistency with their results . in run a , the temperature and thermal pressure in the same location",
    "are 0.4 kev and @xmath136 dyn @xmath135 respectively ( also see table 2 , note that the temperature is space - averaged value of the shocked ism ) . in contrast , in jet model and quasar outflow model ,",
    "the predicted temperature is larger than a few kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and 1 kev ( @xcite ) respectively .",
    "we think that the main reason for such a discrepancy is that the wind velocities , and more importantly the mass fluxes of wind , in these two models are too high .    we have calculated the bremsstrahlung radiation , and found that the total lost energy is no more than ten percent of the total internal energy of the surrounding region .",
    "so cooling effect is very weak .",
    "we note that the interaction region between the winds and the cmz gas is also quite bright in x - ray band , which looks like a cone upside down on the galactic plane .",
    "this structure explains the features observed in the _ rosat _ x - ray survey by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned in  4.1 , the brightness of the conical x - ray structure near the gc observed in 0.5@xmath91.5 kev is related with the time duration starting from the quenching of the past activity of sgr a*. from run b , we find that the time duration should be no more than @xmath11 0.2 myr .",
    "observations also show that we can only see the east ( left ) x - ray structure of the northern sky . together with the bending of the northern _ fermi _ bubble , we speculate that this phenomenon may be caused by the galactic wind blowing from the east to the west in the northern sky .",
    "hence , the forward shock in the east will be stronger than the west , and both the temperature and the density of the shocked ism in the east will be larger than the west , inducing the asymmetric structure of x - ray emission .",
    "another possibility is that the initial ism is not symmetric , with the density in the left ( east ) part being higher .",
    "the _ rosat _ x - ray structure looks like an x - ray cavity .",
    "such kinds of cavities have also been observed in other galaxies or galaxy clusters .",
    "usually people think they are formed by the interaction between jets and ism or intergalactic medium .",
    "however our result reminds us that these cavities may be well formed by the interaction between the winds ( rather than jet ! ) from the central agn and the igm . as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite in the case of the cavity in m87 , if the cavity were formed by the jet",
    ", we would expect a sharp bow shock regions between a jet and surrounding medium .",
    "this structure has never been observed .",
    "the morphology also depends on the viscosity coefficient @xmath49 , as shown by fig .",
    "[ label4 ] .",
    "we can see from the figure that if the viscosity coefficient is larger , the bubble will be more spherical .",
    "the winds near the cmz suffer from the viscous force because of the large velocity gradient on the @xmath137@xmath9@xmath138 plane , and they are slowed down by the cmz significantly . if viscosity coefficient is larger , the kinetic energy of wind gas will be dissipated into internal energy more efficiently , then the thermal pressure close to the gc will be larger .",
    "therefore , the opening angle of the blown - up cmz gas will be wider , which causes the bubble more spherical .",
    "viscosity can suppress both the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities .",
    "following equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) from @xcite , we can estimate the timescales for the growth of both instabilities .",
    "for example , for the rt instability to form a @xmath139 kpc structure at height @xmath140 kpc , the required timescale is about 5 myr ; while for the kh instability , it is about 1.5 myr .",
    "so both instabilities can grow up during the formation of the _ fermi _ bubbles . from the left plot of fig .",
    "[ label4 ] we can see that , when viscosity is not included , large rolls with typical length scales of @xmath11 kpc inside the shocked ism are formed . however , for all the other runs with viscosity included , no such rolls are found .",
    "another role of viscosity is the viscous heating .",
    "this effect is important in the interaction region between winds and cmz . in this region ,",
    "the main components of viscous stress tensor are @xmath141 @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath144 , ~t_xz + t_yz . for the interaction region , @xmath145 . replacing @xmath146 with @xmath147 and @xmath148 with @xmath149 pc",
    ", we can estimate that the time - scale for the winds to pass through this region is @xmath11 1 myr .",
    "the density of the cmz gas blown up in the interaction region is @xmath150 .",
    "then the increase of temperature is @xmath151 k.         what is the role of thermal conduction ?",
    "we study this problem in run e ( without thermal conduction ) .",
    "[ label6 ] shows the distribution of the electron number density and temperature . a jet - like structure along the @xmath152-axis is clearly seen . since the grids along the @xmath152-axis are elongated",
    ", we need to check whether this feature is artificial or not .",
    "we have done such a test and found that this feature is likely real .",
    "the temperature of this structure is relatively low but the density is high .",
    "their formation mechanism is as follows . in the inner region , the massive cmz gas acts like a wall around sgr a * , preventing the winds from expanding in the horizontal direction .",
    "the winds collide with the cmz and the kinetic energy of winds is converted into thermal energy , thus the temperature and pressure increase .",
    "the high - pressure gas then escapes towards the polar direction , squeezing the wind from sgr a * and causing the formation of this jet - like structure .",
    "however , when we include thermal conduction as in most of our runs , this structure disappears .",
    "this is because thermal conduction can efficiently transport energy between the regions with different temperature thus smooth out this structure .           for simplification ,",
    "we have adopted a power - law distribution for the density distribution of the initial ism : @xmath153 , where _ a _ and _ n _ are constants , and @xmath154 is in unit of @xmath155 pc in our simulations .",
    "the value of _ a _ has a weak influence on the age of the _ fermi _ bubbles .",
    "this can be seen in run f ( refer to fig . [ label7 ] ) .",
    "although the density is two times higher than the basic run , it only takes 20% more time to form the bubbles .",
    "this is easy to understand from equations ( [ equ_r2 ] ) and ( [ equ_rfan ] ) .",
    "different from the parameter _ a _ , the value of _ n _ is more important to influence the evolution of the bubbles .",
    "for example , our simulations show that if the index _",
    "n _ is changed into 2.0 from 1.6 while _",
    "a _ remains unchanged compared to run f , the age of the bubble would be 7 myr , which is half of the age of run f. the temperature of the shocked ism in latitude @xmath133 is about 1 kev in this case .",
    "physically , this is because the kinetic energy of shocked ism is nearly a constant fraction of the total energy injected from gc .",
    "specially , from equations ( [ equ_r2 ] ) and ( [ equ_rfan ] ) , we can obtain : m_c^2_2=2a p_wt,[energyequ ] where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the mass and velocity of shocked ism respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath158 is almost a constant : @xmath159 .",
    "so we can approximately rewrite the righthand side of equation ( [ energyequ ] ) as : @xmath160 ( @xmath161 is a constant ) , or @xmath162 when @xmath40 keeps unchanged . for the two cases mentioned above ,",
    "if _ a _ is doubled , @xmath156 is doubled , while _ n _ changed from 1.6 to 2.0 , @xmath156 is only 1/8 of the former .",
    "that s why the ages are 20% larger and one - half smaller respectively .      in run g",
    ", the mass flux of winds is three times higher than run a , while the wind velocity is the same .",
    "the age is 34% shorter than run a. this is very close to the result of 31% by the simple analytical analysis shown by equation ( [ equ_r2 ] ) . because of the increase of the wind power , the velocity of the forward shock increases thus the temperature of the shocked ism becomes higher , while the increase of temperature inside the bubble is not so obvious .    in run h , we reduce the wind velocity but keep the kinetic power of wind ( @xmath40 ) unchanged compared to run a. we find that the kinetic and thermal energy and temperature of different regions do not change much ( refer to table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this means that , the results mainly depend on the kinetic power , while the velocity and mass outflow rate are degenerate .",
    "this is also easy to be understood from equations ( [ equ_r2 ] ) and ( [ equ_p ] ) .",
    "the gas inside the bubbles mainly comes from the blown - up cmz gas instead of winds injected from sgr a*. in addition , the evaporation of the bubble edge , which is determined by thermal conduction , should also supply additional gas .",
    "but since there is large uncertainty on thermal conduction coefficient , it is hard for our model to predict the exact mass of the gas inside the bubbles .",
    "in addition to the total mass , another interesting quantity is the temperature of the gas inside the bubbles . to estimate the temperature , we need to know the pressure .",
    "this quantity is equal to the gas pressure of the shocked ism , which is well determined by the density of ism and the wind power from equation ( 10 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty of the gas density inside the bubbles mentioned - above makes it hard to precisely predict the temperature . based on our simulation of run a",
    ", we can only estimate the temperature of gas within the bubbles to be in the range of @xmath163 k. observational constraints are still lacking .",
    "we have performed hydrodynamical numerical simulations to study the formation mechanism of the _ fermi _ bubbles detected by _ fermi_-lat .",
    "our main aim in the present paper is to explain the morphology and the thermodynamical properties of the bubble , but leaving the study of the production of @xmath17-ray photons and the explanation of the spectrum to our next work . while sgr a * is quite dim at the present stage ,",
    "many observational evidences indicate that this source should be much more active in the past .",
    "specifically , one possibility suggested by a previous work is that the mass accretion rate of the hot accretion flow in sgr a * should be @xmath0 times higher than the present value and this activity lasts for several myr ( totani 2006 ) .",
    "based on this scenario , we show that the observed _ fermi _ bubbles can be well formed by the interaction between the winds launched from the `` past '' hot accretion flow and ism . in our model , the winds",
    "last for @xmath24 yr and the activity of sgr a * was quenched no more than @xmath164 myr ago .",
    "the properties of wind such as the mass flux and velocity are not free parameters but obtained from the previous works on mhd numerical simulations of hot accretion flows .",
    "viscosity and thermal conduction are included which can suppress various instabilities and make the gas inside the bubble uniform .",
    "the required power of the winds is @xmath165 , which is fully consistent with the previous studies on the past activity of sgr a*. the edge of the bubbles corresponds to the contact discontinuity which is the boundary between the shocked interstellar medium and the shocked winds .",
    "properties of the bubbles such as the morphology and the total energy are consistent with observations .",
    "the limb - brightened _ rosat _ x - ray structure can be interpreted by the shocked ism behind the forward shock , while the conical - like x - ray structure close to galactic center is interpreted by the interaction region of wind gas and cmz gas .",
    "our model can also quantitatively explain both the thermal pressure and the temperature of the x - ray structure in high latitude position ( @xmath133 ) revealed by the recent _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "in addition to winds , jets should also co - exist with hot accretion flow ( yuan & narayan 2014 ) . in our model , we do not include the jet .",
    "we assume that the interaction between jet and the interstellar medium is negligible because , by definition , jet must be well - collimated and be as fast as the light . in this case , we expect that the jet will simply drill through the ism , with almost no interaction with the ism in the galaxy .",
    "we have also calculated the energy transformation efficiency in our model .",
    "we find that at @xmath166 kpc , @xmath11 60% of the total energy of winds injected from sgr a * is transported into the ism .",
    "obviously , such a high efficiency is because of the large opening angle of winds .",
    "this result suggests that we may consider the role of winds in solving the cooling flow problem in some elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "usually people consider the heating of ism or intracluster medium by jets ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , numerical simulations have found that jet may only be able to deposit their energy at @xmath167 kpc thus not very efficient ( @xcite ) .",
    "some solutions have been suggested , e.g. , the precession of a jet , or motions of intracluster medium ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . but",
    "another possible way is to invoke winds whose existence has been firmly established by both observational and theoretical studies . given our successful explanation of the formation of the _ fermi _ bubbles by the wind model , it is also worthwhile to study whether the x - ray cavities observed in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which have the similar morphology with the _ fermi _ bubbles , can be produced by winds .",
