    "bcs theory modified to account for @xmath1-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter has provided a solid basis for a first understanding of the properties of the cuprates around optimum and in the overdoped regime",
    ". however , the underdoped region of the phase diagram provides challenges to such a simple approach .",
    "these systems present many features that have been considered anomalous and are not part of simple bcs theory .",
    "while the subject remains controversial and very different ideas have been put forward to understand these anomalies , a recently developed model by yang , rice and zhang ( yrz)@xcite which is based on a spin liquid resonating valence bond approach , has had considerable success in this direction .",
    "it is very different from the preformed pair model@xcite where a superconducting gap forms at a high temperature , the pseudogap temperature @xmath2 , and the superconductivity appears only at a lower temperature @xmath3 as a result of the onset of phase coherence .",
    "the yrz model has a central element , a new energy scale , the pseudogap @xmath4 , which is responsible for changes in the electronic structure of the normal state above @xmath3 .",
    "the pseudogap is distinct from the superconducting gap @xmath5 and the superconducting state is conceived as forming from this new normal pseudogap phase which is quite different from an ordinary fermi liquid state . in the yrz model ,",
    "the large fermi surface of fermi liquid theory ( flt ) reconstructs into hole and electron pockets as a result of the growth in pseudogap at doping levels @xmath6 , in the underdoped region of the cuprate phase diagram , with @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the doping associated with a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the model is related but different from other competing order proposals such as d - density wave formation@xcite and has the desirable property that , in its final form , it remains simple and has been successfully applied to the calculation of many superconducting properties@xcite . besides a self - energy which accounts for the formation of a pseudogap on the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone ( afbz ) boundary ,",
    "the model has gutzwiller factors modifying the underlying band structure parameters .",
    "these narrow the bands as correlation effects become more important .",
    "also , a gutzwiller factor accounts for the loss of coherence which greatly reduces the weight of the remaining quasiparticle peak as the incoherent background increases .",
    "these elements account for the approach to the mott insulating state which is best understood near half - filling in a localized picture of electron dynamics . the hopping from one site to another is blocked by a large hubbard @xmath9 which describes the energy cost for double occupancy .",
    "the pseudogap and afbz then plays a role similar to a band gap at the brillouin zone in ordinary band theory but with essential differences .",
    "for example , in yrz , the bands are not filled rigidly with decreasing doping but instead undergo profound changes as the pseudogap increases .    among the properties already calculated and compared with experiment",
    "are raman@xcite , specific heat@xcite , optical properties@xcite , aspects of angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts)@xcite including the checkerboard pattern@xcite , andreev tunneling@xcite and also the penetration depth@xcite .",
    "each of these properties show behaviors which can not be understood in @xmath1-wave bcs nor in it extensions to include inelastic scattering@xcite , anisotropy@xcite , or strong coupling effects rooted in eliashberg theory@xcite . among the previously considered anomalous properties that are now understood",
    "are the two distinct gap scales seen in raman spectra .",
    "the b@xmath10 peak decreases with decreasing doping while the b@xmath11 scale increases instead@xcite .",
    "the normalized jump in the specific heat drops rather precipitously as @xmath6 decreases towards the bottom of the superconducting dome@xcite .",
    "new structures are seen in the optical self - energy and the two energy scales found in the partial optical sum as a function of energy are understood@xcite .",
    "the rapid drop in the superfluid density at zero temperature with decreasing @xmath6 while the slope of the low temperature linear in @xmath12 law is relatively only weakly changed is also shown@xcite .",
    "encouraged by these successes , here we consider the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present the formalism of yrz@xcite for the electron spectral density in the underdoped regime .",
    "it includes pseudogap formation below a qcp at a doping of @xmath13 .",
    "we describe how this new energy scale modifies the electronic structure from the usual large fermi surface of flt to luttinger pockets . there are two energy branches in the theory @xmath14 , with @xmath15 giving a hole pocket and @xmath16 an electron pocket , the latter only in a restricted doping range just below @xmath17 .",
    "for very underdoped samples , only the hole pocket remains . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our results for the quasiparticle dos with and without superconductivity and also break up the results into their partial contributions from each of the two energy branches separately .",
    "we discuss how the pseudogap alone introduces an asymmetry between positive and negative biases in the dos @xmath18 and how superconductivity overrides this effect and so restores particle - hole symmetry at small energies of order the superconducting gap energy @xmath19 . at higher energy ,",
    "asymmetry remains .",
    "we also show that modifications in the dos introduced by superconductivity which are confined to a range of a few times @xmath19 in the case of a fermi liquid extend instead over the range of the pseudogap energy scale in yrz . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider decomposing the total quasiparticle dos into partial contributions from fixed angle @xmath20 measured from @xmath21 in the upper right quadrant of the brillouin zone .",
    "these partial distributions can display several structures .",
    "nevertheless , upon examination we are able to define for each direction @xmath20 an energy gap associated with a specific peak in the partial dos .",
    "this peak which is taken mainly , but not always , to correspond to the smallest energy closest to @xmath22 , is sometimes the superconducting gap peak but can also be a pseudogap peak .",
    "the energies extracted in this way show considerable anisotropy between positive and negative biases which is a fundamental characteristic of the model used here .",
    "we find evidence in experiment for this anisotropy and provide a comparison with sts data . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the limit of low bias where the dos is linear in @xmath23 .",

    "this last condition can easily be relaxed to have the maximum gap at 0.16 instead ( as in experiment ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show how the fermi surface contours evolve with doping . at the qcp ( @xmath57 ) there is no pseudogap in the yrz model and the fermi surface is the usual large open surface of fermi liquid theory ( flt ) .",
    "as @xmath6 is lowered into the underdoped regime , the fermi surface reconstructs and luttinger contours of zero energy emerge .",
    "they correspond to either @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "the solutions for the first case give the hole pockets centered on the nodal direction and these exist for @xmath60 to @xmath61 as indicated in the figure . for the case of @xmath62 but not for the other values of doping shown , there is an additional electron pocket ( @xmath59 ) located in the region between the afbz boundary ( dashed red line ) and the brillouin zone which extends from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , where @xmath20 is an angle measured from the origin @xmath21 in the right hand upper quadrant of the brillouin zone as shown . in both cases for hole and electron contours , solutions to the equation @xmath65 when they exist ( for a given angle @xmath20 ) always come in pairs . for some angles however , there is no solution at all .",
    "when two solutions exist , the backside of the luttinger pocket closest to the afbz boundary ( red dashed line ) has only a small weight @xmath66 as compared with the front part which is orientated towards the center of the brillouin zone for the hole pocket and oppositely for the electron pocket .",
    "both of these have weight of order one and this is the piece of the fermi surface ( fs ) which corresponds to the fermi liquid ( fl ) when the pseudogap goes to zero .",
    "the backsides instead go into the afbz boundary and have weight exactly equal to zero in this same limit .",
    "as seen in the figure , when @xmath6 moves towards the mott insulating state , the luttinger hole pocket becomes increasingly short with @xmath61 moving toward the nodal direction and this is the agency whereby the metallicity of the material is increasingly reduced . the number of states with significant weighting and zero excitation energy is reduced .",
    "the approach to half filling has a progressively stronger detrimental effect on the dynamics of the charge carriers due to the increased magnitude of the pseudogap which has opened on the afbz boundary .",

    "it provides a factor of @xmath149 while the gap velocity is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "pushp et al.@xcite found in sts data that the slope was nearly constant over a significant doping range below optimum . matching their reduction from optimum of the @xmath3 of their samples with our superconducting dome in order to determine the relation to the doping @xmath6 used in our model , we plot the slope of their data normalized to the value at optimum versus @xmath6 .",

    "comparison with this data ( solid black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) shows that , around @xmath150 which is the doping in our calculations that corresponds to a reduction of @xmath3 by a factor of 3 below its value at optimum , the predicted slope represented by the dashed red curve starts to increase while experiment does not .",
    "this could mean that in reality the gutzwiller factor is a more strongly decaying function of @xmath6 than the one we have used .",
    "alternatively , broadening will have the tendency to decrease the slope .",
    "however , so far we are neglecting another important effect associated with the yrz model . in this model the gap to @xmath3 ratio @xmath151 , which for simplicity we have fixed at a value of 6 in all our calculations , is known to vary importantly with @xmath6 .",
    "in very recent work , schachinger and carbotte@xcite have solved a generalized bcs gap equation with the pseudogap and fermi surface reconstruction fully accounted for and have found that this ratio changes from its canonical value of @xmath152 at @xmath57 ( optimum ) to @xmath153 or even higher towards the end of the dome as the mott insulator and antiferromagnetism is approached .",
    "accounting for this reduces the variation in slope between optimum and highly underdoped by @xmath154% , bringing our calculations much closer to experiment as indicated by the red dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) .",
    "the overall agreement between theory and the data is very good .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath47 provides an important factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : slope ] ) which brings theory much closer to experiment than what one would find in a fl approach and this also is true as well for the variation of gap to critical temperature ratio .",
    "we have computed the total quasiparticle dos in the resonating valence bond spin liquid model@xcite of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "when superconductivity is not included , the formation of the pseudogap , which provides a mechanism for fermi surface reconstruction , modifies the underlying fermi liquid dos in an asymmetric way with respect to the fermi energy @xmath155 . for small values of the pseudogap just below the critical doping associated with a qcp",
    ", the resulting depression in @xmath18 is confined to negative energies .",
    "as doping is reduced towards the mott insulating state , the depression deepens , covers a larger range in energy and spans positive as well as negative biases but its effect remains asymmetric .",
    "however , if superconductivity is also included , particle - hole symmetry is restored at lower energies of order @xmath156 , although beyond this range the asymmetry associated with the pseudogap remains .",
    "this effect is traced to the fact that the pseudogap is associated with the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone rather than the fermi surface where the superconducting gap opens .",
    "one can trace peaks in the total quasiparticle dos which are , at optimum doping and just below , coherence peaks due to superconductivity but these evolve for @xmath89 into pseudogap peaks which are distinctly different for positive and negative biases .",
    "this asymmetry is an intrinsic part of the yrz model and can be used to test its validity .",
    "we are also able to trace a second set of peaks associated with the superconducting gap which however originate from the end of the luttinger hole pocket at an angle @xmath61 in the brillouin zone . in the heavily underdoped region of the phase diagram , these peaks are the only ones that can be identified as due purely to the superconducting gap .",
    "these signatures are relatively weak , however , as found in , for example , the experiments of boyer et al.@xcite , in comparison with those seen in an ordinary @xmath1-wave bcs superconductor . as a function of doping ,",
    "the energy corresponding to these coherence structures follow the dome associated with the critical temperature although the scale of the effective gap involved is reduced .    when the total dos is decomposed into partial contributions from each angle",
    "@xmath20 in the brillouin zone separately , @xmath97 , it is found that at some angles @xmath97 can show complex behavior as a function of energy @xmath23 and even display several peaks .",
    "such distributions can not be modeled by the simple function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : neff ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , we find that we could identify , in a fairly unambiguous fashion , a single peak in these distributions which was both close to the origin @xmath22 and had significant amplitude .",
    "this provides a single energy scale for each direction @xmath20 . at angles near the nodal direction ,",
    "this scale is associated with the superconducting gap but as @xmath20 is decreased it progresses into a peak associated with the pseudogap energy . in some cases",
    "the transition from one scale to the other is smooth while in others it can be abrupt and also somewhat ambiguous .",
    "what is found is that the superconducting gap peak at low energies rapidly loses intensity while the pseudogap peak at higher energies is quite intense and so dominates over the lower energy structure and thus must be chosen as characteristic of a single gap scale for this angle @xmath20 in the brillouin zone .",
    "this gap can however differ considerably in size depending on the sign of the bias involved . for energy below the superconducting gap scale ,",
    "there is little asymmetry but this changes radically as the antinodal direction is approached in the highly underdoped regime where the pseudogap is probed .",
    "our findings have implications for the analysis of sts data when one wishes to extract directional information from such experiments.@xcite comparison with the data of pushp et al . for both @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath157 shows indeed an asymmetry in the dos which is in qualitative agreement with the yrz model .",
    "another result is that the zero energy slope of the dos is importantly reduced from its fl value in yrz theory because of the appearance of a gutzwiller factor @xmath47 which is a rapidly decreasing function as @xmath6 decreases and represents the reduction , due to correlation effects , of the coherent part of the charge carrier green s function .",
    "this factor can partially compensate for the rapid increase in slope that would occur due to the appearance of the gap velocity @xmath148 in the denominator of the expression for the slope in ordinary bcs theory .",
    "however , this factor is modulated by a rapid increase in the value of gap to critical temperature found to be the direct consequence of an increase in the pseudogap in the theoretical work of schachinger and carbotte.@xcite without these two effects there would be a serious conflict between theory and the experimental results of pushp et al.@xcite who find a slope which remains fairly constant in the underdoped regime . while a comparison with the existing data and yrz predictions gives qualitative agreement ,",
