    "recent cosmological observations suggest a flat universe in a current accelerated expansion but full with 95% of unknown matter .",
    "25% of the matter in the universe , widely known as dark matter , is responsible of the formation of the large scale structure we observe in the sky : galaxies , clusters of galaxies , voids , walls , etc .",
    "this model of dark matter has been very successful@xcite .    however , at galactic scale , numerical simulations show some discrepancies between dark - matter predictions and observations@xcite .",
    "dark matter simulations show cuspy halos of galaxies with an excess of small scale structure , while observations suggest a constant halo core density@xcite and a small number of subgalactic objects@xcite . in order to solve these discrepancies , there are some proposals of scalar fields as dark matter in the literature nowadays@xcite . all of them have assumed a polynomial scalar potential up to fourth order . at the cosmological scale ,",
    "the main results are cold dark matter - like behavior , growing linear perturbations , the existence of a jeans scale and suppression of the mass power at small scales , but they depend upon initial conditions . at the galactic scale , where the self - interaction becomes important ,",
    "the scattering cross section is proportional to the quartic coupling square @xmath2 , which is a free parameter of the models . even if there is a model - independent result in which a particle with a value for the scattering cross section given by ( [ sigma ] ) has , straightforwardly , a mean - free path of order of 1 mpc ( see eq .",
    "( 4 ) in@xcite ) , the free parameters of the potential are very related , as we can see in eq . ( 6 ) of ref.@xcite . depending of the coupling @xmath3 the mass of the scalar field could be of order of mev , inclusive .",
    "but nobody has determined the value of this coupling .    in this paper , we continue investigating the hypothesis of a scalar field as dark matter in the universe with a @xmath4 scalar potential@xcite    @xmath5 \\label{cosh}\\ ] ]    with @xmath6 being the inverse square of the reduced planck mass . using results given in renormalization theory , we calculate the @xmath7 cross section at the lowest order for the potential ( [ cosh ] ) .",
    "it is found that the result corresponds to an effective @xmath8-theory in which the effective coupling @xmath3 is exponentially enhanced by the scale of renormalization @xmath9 , which remains as a free parameter of the model .",
    "this result is compared with the value given for the cross section in self - interacting dark matter models .",
    "we found that if the scale of renormalization of potential ( [ cosh ] ) is of order of the planck mass , @xmath10 , the predicted scattering cross section by mass of the scalar particles @xmath11 can fit the value predicted in numerical simulations of self - interacting dark matter in order to avoid high - density dark matter halos .",
    "this model neither depends on initial conditions nor has problems with nucleosynthesis ( provided that @xmath12 ) and scales as radiation at early times , because of its exponential behavior .",
    "it scales as cold dark matter once the scalar field @xmath0 oscillates around the minimum of the potential .",
    "its fluctuations are also the same than those of standard cold dark matter but it predict a cut - off in the mass power spectrum , now due to its quadratic behavior .",
    "this results are enclosed in the following relations@xcite    @xmath13    @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the current contributions of dark matter and radiation to the critical energy density @xmath16 with @xmath17 the current hubble parameter and then @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the mass of the scalar field and @xmath20 is the jeans wave number at which the mass power spectrum has a cut - off , a very important difference with respect to the standard cold dark matter model .",
    "we recall that the model , at this level , has only one free parameter : @xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , if we expect a cut - off in the mass power spectrum about the wave number @xmath22@xcite , we can use the last of eqs .",
    "( [ util2 ] ) to determine @xmath23 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath24 , then , we also obtain that @xmath25 and the corresponding ultra - light mass of the scalar field is @xmath26@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the expected cut - off of the mass power spectrum in the universe fixes the last free parameter of the model . up to this point ,",
    "all parameters in potential ( [ cosh ] ) are completely determined , we recover the success of standard cold dark matter model at large scales and we have in addition a cut - off in the mass power spectrum , alleviating problems of the standard model at subgalactic level .",
    "some differences with respect to other scalar field models appear because of the non - polynomial behavior of ( [ cosh ] ) in certain regimes .",
    "for instance , at cosmological scale , the exponential - like behavior provokes no problem with initial conditions either for @xmath27 or the fluctuations ( no fine - tuning ) .",
    "also , the jeans scale is related to the time at which the scalar field changes its behavior as radiation - like to cold dark matter - like@xcite , not to the time of radiation - matter equality as in polynomial potentials@xcite .    moreover , because of the presence of a scalar field potential ( [ cosh ] ) , there must be an important self - interaction among the scalar particles .",
    "for example , even if scalar particles are lighter than neutrinos , the former can cluster due to the presence of the scalar potential .",
    "that means that this scalar field dark matter model belongs to the so called group of self - interacting dark matter models which are characterized by a @xmath7 scattering cross section@xcite .",
    "the scalar potential ( [ cosh ] ) can be written as a series of even powers in @xmath0 , @xmath28 .",
    "working on 4 dimensions , it is commonly believed that only @xmath29 and lower order theories are renormalizable .",
    "but , following the important work@xcite , if we consider that there is only one intrinsic scale @xmath30 in the theory , we conclude that there is a momentum cut - off and that we can have an effective @xmath31 theory which depends upon all couplings in the theory .",
    "in addition , it was recently demonstrated@xcite that scalar exponential - like potentials of the form ( we have used the notation of potential ( [ cosh ] ) and for example , parameter @xmath32 in eqs . 7 - 8 in ref.@xcite is @xmath33 ) )    @xmath34    are non - perturbative solutions of the exact renormalization group equation in the local potential approximation ( lpa ) ( we have taken a massless gaussian fixed point potential , i.e. parameter @xmath35 in eq . ( 5 ) of @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath21 are free parameters of the potential and @xmath9 is the scale of renormalization .",
    "being our potential a @xmath37-like potential ( non - polynomial ) , it is then a solution to the renormalization group equations in the ( lpa ) , too . comparing eqs .",
    "( [ cosh ] , [ renpot ] ) , we can identify @xmath38 with    @xmath39    and we see that an additional free parameter appears , the scale of renormalization @xmath9 . from this",
    ", we can assume that potential ( [ cosh ] ) is renormalizable with only one intrinsic scale : @xmath9 .",
    "even though the parameters in the scalar potential ( [ cosh ] ) were fixed by cosmological observations , the scale @xmath9 remains free .",
    "we now proceed to calculate the @xmath40 scattering cross section for the scalar particles . following the procedure shown in@xcite for a potential with even powers of the dimensionless scalar field @xmath41 , @xmath42 ,",
    "the scattering amplitudes are given by    @xmath43    where , in our case , the dimensionless @xmath44 are    @xmath45    and the internal contraction @xmath46 reads    @xmath47    summing the series ( [ series ] ) we find    @xmath48    since the only scale that appears naturally in gravitation is the planck mass in @xmath49 , we can expect that @xmath50 and then @xmath51 . in consequence , @xmath52 .",
    "then , the cross section for @xmath53 scattering in the center - of - mass frame is    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the total energy . at this point",
    ", we can notice the non - perturbative nature of potential ( [ cosh ] ) .",
    "had we taken perturbatively the scalar potential ( [ cosh ] ) with a coupling @xmath56 , the self - interaction would have appeared as extremely weak .",
    "but , surprisingly , we can observe from eqs .",
    "( [ tau ] , [ amp ] ) that the contribution of higher - order couplings points to an effective coupling @xmath57 .",
    "an interesting dark matter model is that of a self - interacting dark matter@xcite .",
    "this proposal considers that dark matter particles have an interaction characterized by a scattering cross section by mass of the particles given by @xcite      this self - interaction provides shallow cores of galaxies and a minimum scale of structure formation , that it must also be noticed as a cut - off in the mass power spectrum@xcite .",
    "the cosh - potential ( [ cosh ] ) directly provides this cut - off , but the self - interaction among scalar particles would be important for other aspects of galaxy evolution .",
    "the range of @xmath9 is very narrow because of the exponential behavior .",
    "observe that the scale of renormalization is of order of the planck mass .",
    "recalling that @xmath62 , we also find that @xmath63 tev .",
    "all parameters are completely fixed now .",
    "an intriguing point is the appearance of two different energy scales , one in @xmath9 and another one in @xmath36 in ( [ renpot ] ) , and it could be not only a coincidence that the former is of @xmath64 and the latter is of @xmath65 . it should be noted that it is the combination of these scales which determines the observable value of parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 , at the cosmological scale , and the value of @xmath68 at the galactic one .",
    "this could be the first case in which the relevant scales are hidden into the effective theory at low - energies , as it was claimed that the solution ( [ renpot ] ) is a solution of the renormalization group equations `` irrespectively of the high energy theory''@xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the potential ( [ cosh ] ) has been widely studied in non perturbative field theory in @xmath69 dimensions where it is known as the sinh - gordon model ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we would like to mention that our first motivation was to investigate the hypothesis of scalar dark matter in galaxies , from a pure general relativistic point of view@xcite .",
    "the main result have been that an exponential - like potential appears naturally if one wants to fit rotation curves in galaxies , in both axially@xcite and spherically symmetric cases@xcite .",
    "since it is known that the formation of galaxies from dark matter involves non - lineal phenomena that can only be analyzed using numerical simulations , the cases treated in@xcite can be considered as good approximations to the exact solution with the potential ( [ cosh ] ) .",
    "but , even if the evolution of a galaxy could be described by self - interacting dark matter models@xcite , the scalar nature of dark matter can provide us with a more interesting picture : bose condensation@xcite .",
    "for instance , the relaxation time for the condensate would be smaller than the age of the universe if@xcite      we find that @xmath71 .",
    "again , @xmath9 should be of order of the planck mass . from this",
    ", it is clear that , at galactic scales , the scalar field dark matter model with the scalar potential ( [ cosh ] ) must be studied both in general relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "this is beyond the purpose of this paper and is left for future work .",
    "summarizing , a scalar field endowed with the scalar potential ( [ cosh ] ) is a reliable model as dark matter in the universe , not only at cosmological level , but also at galactic level because of its self - interaction .",
    "even if we are dealing with a non - perturbative case , the scalar potential is renormalizable at a energy scale of order of the planck mass .",
    "also , all relevant scales are hidden into the parameters of the effective theory , but they might be very important when performing quantum calculations ."
