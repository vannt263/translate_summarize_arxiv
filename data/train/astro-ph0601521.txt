    "a pulsar parallax can be combined with a measurement of the pulsar s dispersive delay ( the dispersion measure or dm ) to provide an accurate measure of the free electron density along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "psr j0030 + 0451 is one of fewer than a dozen pulsars to have its parallax measured via timing @xcite .",
    "another dozen have been measured via vlbi ( e.g. see brisken et al .",
    "2002 , chatterjee et al .",
    "2004 , and also this urlshami / psrvlb / parallax.html ] ) .",
    "these measurements are important because they give us most of our knowledge about the galactic thermal electron distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition , psr j0030 + 0451 presents a rare evolutionary case as an isolated millisecond pulsar ( msp ) . in the most popular msp evolutionary model ,",
    "msps are formed via accretion of matter from a companion star .",
    "the incoming matter adds to the pulsar s angular momentum , i.e. , the pulsar is `` spun up . ''",
    "however , isolated msps present a conundrum : they were presumably spun up , yet they are without a companion which would have done so .",
    "one possible scenario is that the pulsar has ablated its companion @xcite .",
    "we expect msps to have lower velocities than the regular population , because the kick from the supernova progenitor had to be small enough to leave the binary intact . to produce an isolated msp , the binary must remain intact during and after the supernova , but then after the spin - up phase the companion must leave the system or be evaporated .",
    "several authors have debated whether isolated msp velocities are lower , higher , or indistinguishable from those of the general population of msps .",
    "@xcite suggest we might expect isolated msps to have higher velocities .",
    "they argue that if isolated msps are formed by ablation , we would expect them to form from the tighter binaries which are more susceptible to ablation .",
    "the correlation between tight binaries and higher velocities is suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite present the argument for faster velocities for isolated msps as a counterpoint to their timing proper motion and scintillation measurements which suggest the opposite , as do the measurements of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , find the velocities of the populations to be indistinguishable .",
    "we present a measurement of the transverse velocity of psr j0030 + 0451 which is unusually small , even compared to the isolated msp population .",
    "we reconsider the question of the velocity of isolated msps as compared to the binary msp population .    owing to its small timing",
    "residual , @xmath31  @xmath4s , psr j0030 + 0451 is a good candidate for membership in the pulsar timing array ( pta ) , which is a collection of pulsars that will be used for detecting gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "for this reason , continued refinement of the timing model of psr j0030 + 0451 is important .",
    "in fact , the pta , as it is conceived , is an interferometer , so a variety of baselines will be important to its operation .",
    "psr j0030 + 0451 may be particularly useful in this regard because it has large angular separation from psrs b1855 + 09 , j1713 + 07 and j0437 - 4715 , which are among the most stable and precise pulsars @xcite .    in  2 we present a significant refinement to the timing model previously published @xcite .",
    "we discuss our measurements of parallax and proper motion in ",
    "[ sec : pm_px ] .",
    "we include the effects of the solar wind in our analysis , which we discuss in  4 . in  5,6 , and  7",
    "we discuss the space velocity of j0030 + 0451 , corrections to its measured period derivative , and the implications of its measured distance for the local interstellar medium ( lism ) .",
    "in  8 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we have conducted timing observations over a 6.5 year period , from 1997 december to 2004 july , at the arecibo observatory , using the arecibo - berkeley pulsar processor ( abpp ) and the princeton mark  iv system .",
    "details of abpp signal processing can be found in @xcite , where the first three years of these data are presented .",
    "details of mark  iv signal processing can be found in @xcite .    over the course of each observation , incoming signals from two orthogonal polarizations",
    "were coherently dedispersed , squared to obtain power measurements , and folded modulo the pulse period for intervals of three minutes .",
    "opposite polarizations were summed , using absolute flux calibrations of the receivers whenever possible or , when absolute flux calibration was not available , using the system temperature of the pulsed noise source as published by telescope operations .",
    "pulse times of arrival ( toas ) were derived from the calibrated three minute integrations using conventional algorithms .",
    "the toas from a given frequency and instrument on a given day were averaged into a single effective toa for that day , the uncertainty of which was estimated from the spread of the individual three - minute toas .",
    "we performed a weighted fit to the averaged toas using tempo .",
    "we used ecliptic coordinates to minimize covariance between the two components of the position and proper motion measurements .",
    "this is usually necessary when the ecliptic latitude is low ( 1.44 in our case ) .",
    "table 1 shows updated spin , astrometric , and other parameters for psr j0030 + 0451 .",
    "the root mean squared ( rms ) of the timing residuals quoted in table 1 , is calculated using toas from profiles averaged over 30 minutes .",
    "we estimated uncertainties in all the fitted parameters by doubling errors given by tempo , an ad hoc procedure that attempts to account for timing noise and other possible systematic errors .",
    "the quoted uncertainty in parallax also includes a term added in quadrature ( 0.3 mas ) due to the solar wind ( see  [ sec : electron ] ) .",
    "residual arrival times after subtracting the best fit are shown in figure [ fig : resid ] .",

    "however , it is interesting to compare our upper limit on @xmath14 , the time derivative of dm , to the correlation between dm and @xmath14 measured by @xcite .",
    "when @xmath14 is included in the timing model , its best - fit value is @xmath15 @xmath8pc  yr@xmath2 , which implies an upper limit ( with 95% confidence ) of @xmath16 @xmath8pc  yr@xmath2 . this value is smaller than expected according to @xcite by about a factor of 5 .",
    "if more small - dm small-@xmath14 pulsars are found it might suggest that @xmath14 is a stronger function of dm than we would expect for wedgelike thermal plasma perturbations distributed randomly along the los .",
    "evidence for a significant parallax measurement is shown in figure [ fig : parallax ] , which compares residuals of the pulse arrival times with and without parallax incorporated into the timing model .",
    "the figure shows averaged timing residuals versus day number binned in increments of 18 days and folded over a half - year period to provide the best visibility for the parallax signature .",
    "the data have been fit for proper motion but not for parallax in the left part of figure [ fig : parallax ] .",
    "data on the right have been fit for both proper motion and for parallax .",
    "we have superimposed the best - fit parallax curve onto the pre - fit data . on close examination of figure [ fig : parallax ]",
    ", there is a subtle difference in the positions of the data points relative to the fit curve ( left plot ) and the horizontal axis ( right plot ) .",
    "this is not an unexpected result of ( a ) a global fit to all the parameters with and without parallax and ( b ) the post - fit binning .",
    "our best - fit value for parallax , @xmath17mas , includes both measurement uncertainty of 0.88 mas and systematic uncertainty due to the solar wind model , 0.3mas , which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "we measure a proper motion of @xmath18mas yr@xmath2 in the plane of the ecliptic",
    ". proper motion out of the ecliptic plane is naturally difficult to measure given the pulsar s position , a problem which was compounded by its high covariance with variations in dispersion measure .",
    "we quote a conservative upper limit on the magnitude of the out - of - plane proper motion of 10 mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "we can combine our distance measurement with our proper motion measurements to yield the pulsar s velocity .",
    "we obtain a velocity of @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 in the plane of the ecliptic and an upper limit of @xmath20  km  s@xmath2 out of the plane of the ecliptic .",
    "thus , the pulsar s transverse velocity lies between 8 and 17 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this confirms the value presented by @xcite , @xmath21 km  s@xmath2 , which they found using scintillation measurements .    the measured proper motion of psr j0030 + 0451 results not just from its motion relative to its local standard of rest ( lsr ) , but also from the difference between its lsr and the lsr of the sun and from the solar motion .",
    "after considering these effects ( see  5 for details ) , we calculate its transverse velocity relative to its lsr to be between 4 and 20 kms@xmath2 .",
    "this is one of the slowest transverse velocities measured for any pulsar .",
    "young pulsars ( those which have not been spun up ) have a mean velocity of 265 km  s@xmath2 @xcite , a factor of three times faster than msps (  5 ; see also hobbs et al .",
    "2005 ; cordes & chernoff 1997 ; nice & taylor 1995 ) . psr j0030 +",
    "0451 is , in fact , only one tenth as fast as the average msp (  5 ) .",
    "psr j0030 + 0451 is roughly in the ecliptic plane ( ecliptic latitude is 1.44 ) where the solar system provides additional dispersion caused by the charged particles of the solar wind .",
    "@xcite show that the solar electron density , _",
    "n_@xmath22 , can be modeled as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the radial distance to the sun in astronomical units , and @xmath25 is roughly 10 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this simple model is the default in tempo . maintaining the @xmath26 dependence , we searched @xmath27 space for the best value of @xmath25 , which we found to be @xmath28@xmath8 .",
    "reducing @xmath25 from 9.0 to 6.9 @xmath8 reduces the fitted parallax by about 0.3 mas which increases the distance by about 30 pc .",
    "these two parameters are covariant because the model of the solar wind yields an annual pattern of pulse delays with a strong cusp when the pulsar is behind the sun with respect to the earth .",
    "a fourier decomposition of this delay pattern yields significant terms with annual periodicity ( covariant with pulsar position ) , semi - annual periodicity ( covariant with parallax ) , as well as higher order terms .",
    "the additional 0.3 mas uncertainty in parallax due to the solar wind was added in quadrature to the doubled tempo error .",
    "note that in the case of psr j1713 + 0747 , another ecliptic plane msp , @xcite found it necessary to eliminate data within 30 of the sun . in our case",
    "we did not find that this significantly improved the fit , nor did it substantially change any fitted parameters .",
    "we wondered if it would be possible to measure a change in the solar wind on its 11-year cycle . using tempo",
    "we mapped @xmath27 space in the range of @xmath610 @xmath8  yr@xmath29 @xmath8  yr@xmath2 but found that the minimum in @xmath27 occurred at an essentially null value of @xmath30@xmath8  yr@xmath2 , indicating that the change is currently beyond our measurement capability .",
    "@xcite presents an extensive study of the velocities of various sub - groups of pulsars , including isolated and binary recycled pulsars .",
    "they find that isolated recycled pulsars are not significantly slower ( @xmath31 km  s@xmath2 ) than binary recycled pulsars ( @xmath32 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "when the velocity of psr j0030 + 0451 ( using 9 km  s@xmath33 ) is added to the sample the average velocity of isolated recycled pulsars becomes @xmath34 km  s@xmath2 , which is still not significantly different from the average of the binary recycled pulsars .",
    "in contrast , both @xcite and @xcite previously claimed to see evidence that isolated msps are slower than binary msps .",
    "however , when one uses a more recent galactic electron density model to estimate the distances to the pulsars @xcite , the discrepancy disappears . this is a potent reminder that a distance model has a significant effect on conclusions drawn from it .",
    "@xcite also find the isolated msp population to have a slightly lower average velocity ( 70 km  s@xmath2 ) as compared to the binary population .",
    "they caution against drawing conclusions from velocity data which are based on imprecise distances .",
    "we performed an analysis of the velocity data that is slightly different from the analysis done by @xcite with similar results .",
    "we defined an msp to be any pulsar with period @xmath35s , which provides a narrower sample than that used by @xcite who defined msps to be any pulsar with period @xmath36s and period derivative @xmath37 .",
    "our criterion means that the binary pulsars in our sample nearly all have helium white dwarf companions , whereas hobbs et al .",
    "used binaries with a mix of companion types .",
    "the 29 msps in the galactic disk with measured proper motions are shown in table [ tab : velocities ] .",
    "psr j1730 - 2304 , which has no measured declination proper motion , has been included in the table for completeness but has not been included in any of the following calculations .",
    "we corrected each pulsar s velocity to its lsr as follows .",
    "we used the measured proper motion and distance to calculate a three dimensional vector representing the ( two dimensional ) transverse motion of the pulsar in the reference frame of the sun .",
    "we then removed the solar motion and rotated the resulting vector from the lsr of the sun to the lsr of the pulsar .",
    "finally , we recovered those two components of the vector which are perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "this computation required selecting a value for the unknown los velocity of the pulsar ; we chose a value appropriate for a star at rest in the pulsar s lsr .",

    "this could be either a reflection of differences in the intrinsic spatial distributions of the two types of msps , or a selection effect .",

    "we have confirmed their results with an updated catalog ; also , a simple examination of the median distance of the isolated population ( 510 pc ) compared to the median distance of the binary population ( 1155 pc ) suggests that the isolated msps must be less luminous .",

    "the acceleration in the disk makes a much smaller contribution , @xmath55 . combining these corrections changes the measured @xmath52 by less than 1% .",
    "the parallax measurement of @xmath56mas yields a distance of @xmath57  pc .",
    "this falls in between the distance estimates made by the old ( taylor & cordes 1993 , hereafter tc93 ) and new ( cordes & lazio 2002 , hereafter ne2001 ) distance models : 230 and 317 respectively .",
    "both estimates are based on a dm of @xmath58@xmath8pc @xcite . in the second galactic quadrant ,",
    "between 90@xmath59 and 180@xmath59 galactic longitude , psr j0030 + 0451 is the first pulsar with a measured parallax , so it provides an important check of the ne2001 model .",
    "in addition to a parameterized model of the lism , the model adds a number of clumps and voids to the previous tc93 model , but nothing in the direction of psr j0030 + 0451 .",
    "the agreement of our distance with theirs suggests no significant clumps or voids exist along this los .",
    "nearby pulsars with known parallaxes are very useful for studying the lism .",
    "scintillation parameters measure density fluctuations and have been used to map out the lism , but are unable to measure densities .",
    "the density measurements must come from parallax @xcite .",
    "these authors model the lism explicitly as a low density bubble surrounded by a shell of much higher density fluctuations , but more pulsars with known distances are required to confirm the model .",
    "psr j0030 + 0451 will therefore be a marvelous tool for studying the lism .",
    "we have measured the parallax of psr j0030 + 0451 to be @xmath60mas .",
    "we have measured its proper motion to be @xmath18  mas  yr@xmath2 in the plane of the ecliptic and have established an upper limit on its motion out of the plane at 10 mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the is one of the lowest velocities measured for any pulsar and is noteworthy even within the relatively low - velocity millisecond pulsar population .    combining proper motion data from this pulsar with the collection of existing msp proper motion measurements , we find the statistical properties of the transverse velocities of isolated and binary msps are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "we do , however , find that the average @xmath49-height of the isolated msps is half that of the binary msps .",
    "we suggest that a luminosity difference between the two classes of objects , such as that suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , is the simplest way to account for both the observed difference in @xmath49-height and the similarity of the velocity distributions .",

    "<S> we measure the parallax of psr j0030 + 0451 to be @xmath0mas , corresponding to a distance of @xmath1pc . </S>",
    "<S> the cordes and lazio ( 2002 ) model of galactic electron distribution yields a dispersion measure derived distance of 317 pc which agrees with our measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we place the pulsar s transverse space velocity in the range of 8 to 17 km  s@xmath2 , making this pulsar one of the slowest known . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a brief census of velocities of isolated versus binary millisecond pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> we find the velocities of the two populations are indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> however , the scale height of the binary population is twice that of the isolated population and the luminosity functions of the two populations are different . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the scale height difference may be an artifact of the luminosity difference . </S>"
