    "quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) in the presence of magnetic field has gained a lot of research interests in recent years .",
    "apart from being exciting for its own intricacy and subtleties , the underlying physics of this strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions is enriched with many remarkable effects @xcite like chiral magnetic effect@xcite , magnetic catalysis@xcite as well as inverse magnetic catalysis effect@xcite , superconductivity of vacuum@xcite and many more .",
    "it is also a remarkable fact that non - central heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc do have the potential to provide the platform for their experimental verifications . in a non - central heavy - ion collision at lhc",
    ", magnetic fields of the order @xmath615@xmath7 ( @xmath8tesla ) can be achieved @xcite which is , in fact , higher than the typical qcd scale i.e @xmath9 .",
    "though in heavy - ion experiments , the fields are produced for a very short interval of time , they are good enough to substantially affect the strongly interacting fire - ball . moreover , in case of weak magnetic field limit the situation becomes almost analogous to the magnetic fields present inside magnetars which can be as high as @xmath61 mev@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the word weak  is used to emphasize the dominance of qcd scale over the @xmath5 scale .",
    "thus systematic understanding of strong interaction with weak magnetic field background can also have significant applications in physics of neutron stars @xcite as well as some other topics of cosmology and early universe . in this context",
    "we briefly recall the proceedings in one of the aforementioned effects namely magnetic field induced superconductivity of vacuum .",
    "though the existence of vacuum superconductor was first proposed a few years ago in ref @xcite with point - like vector mesons , recent researches considering internal(quark ) structures of the mesons kept on throwing new insights into this emerging phenomena . in ref",
    "@xcite it was shown that non - minimal coupling of @xmath3 mesons to the electromagnetic field could result in magnetic - field - induced superconductivity of the cold vacuum along the magnetic field direction .",
    "but due to the vafa - witten theorem @xcite and qcd inequalities , hidaka and yamamoto concluded in ref @xcite that qcd vacuum structure can not be changed only by a magnetic field",
    "i.e magnetic - field - induced charged vector meson condensation is impossible .",
    "soon after their work it has been argued in ref @xcite that @xmath11 condensation in magnetic field background is consistent with the vafa - witten theorem because of the existence of higgs like mechanism and was supported a year later in ref @xcite where it was pointed out that the stronger version of the theorem @xcite was plagued with the prejudiced choice of a generating functional on symmetric vacuum ignoring the other possibilities of non - symmetric vacua .",
    "however , the authors of ref @xcite also performed lattice qcd calculation in support of their conclusions .",
    "interesting comment about that can be found in ref @xcite where it was argued that although the results of ref @xcite based on quenched lattice qcd simulation show vanishing correlation in large volume limit still that can not be a reason to conclude against condensation because of the inherent inhomogeneous nature of the condensate .",
    "for example , fig.4 of ref @xcite clearly demonstrates the fact that the vanishing of mass at the transition point depends on the order of the phase transition . in a careful investigation in the framework of su(2 ) njl model liu et al .",
    "@xcite had pointed out that as the estimated critical field for charged @xmath3 meson condensation is not strong enough , one needs to take into account the contributions of higher landau levels as well ,  considering which the masses of charged @xmath3 mesons with @xmath12 and @xmath13 do vanish at @xmath14 gev@xmath10 . however , in a very recent work in hidden local symmetry approach in constant magnetic field @xcite , it has been found that @xmath15 corrections which are arising from the considerations of @xmath16 terms of derivative / chiral expansion , can in fact , change the trend of the effective mass from decreasing to increasing one resulting in absence of any massless limit point .",
    "thus it is obvious that unanimous agreement on the existence of vacuum superconductor demands more research work in this field . in a recent work , the",
    "pion mass and dispersion relations have been calculated in @xcite with non - zero @xmath5 in vacuum using an effective lagrangian ( with pseudoscalar as well as pseudovactor pion - nucleon interactions ) .",
    "there it was shown that , for pseudoscalar coupling pion effective mass significantly decreases with weak external magnetic field . however , for pseudovector coupling , only a modest increase was reported . using the same methodology , we , in this work , investigate the problem of @xmath3 meson condensation with a phenomenological lagrangian under the influence of a constant weak magnetic field in vacuum .",
    "the modification of dispersion relations due to finite temperature effects will be reported in our future work@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss the formalism for calculating @xmath3 meson self - energy in the presence of weak magnetic field .",
    "following similar approaches as in ref @xcite , we first define the scalar field feynman propagators in constant external abelian gauge field @xcite by schwinger s proper time formalism @xcite and then calculate the effective mass upto one - loop order in self - energy .",
    "the results of our calculation are presented in sec.iii in which the effective mass variations with weak external field are presented followed by the dispersion relations . finally in sec.iv",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and discussions .",
    "the self - energy resummed @xmath3 meson propagator satisfies the dyson - schwinger equation , id_(k ) & = & id_^0(k)+id_^0(k)(-i_^(k))id_(k ) + ( d_)^-1 & = & ( d_^0)^-1-_[invprop ] , where the bare propagator for the massive vector field is given by id_^0=(g^- ) .",
    "the pole of the effective propagator leads to the following dispersion relation & = & 0[dispersion ] .",
    "the exact form of the propagator of a charged scalar particle with mass @xmath17 and charge @xmath18 in presence of a constant magnetic field can be written as @xcite d_b(x,x)&=&(x,x)e^-ip.(x-x)d_b(p ) , + & & + id_b(p)&=&_0^e^is[momspace ] + & & + ( x,x)&=&. as the phase factor of the schwinger s propagator is independent of the path , the overall phase of the one loop self - energy involving two scalar particles becomes unity .",
    "thus we can work in momentum space representation of the scalar propagator as given in eqn.([momspace ] ) . in this paper , we use the following convention : @xmath19 is decomposed into two parts as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "similarly a general four vector can be written as @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "natural units will be used through out the paper . from now on ,",
    "the @xmath26 term in the propagator will not be explicitly written and will be taken care of at the end of the calculation .",
    "the exact propagator in the external magnetic field can be written as a series in powers of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in weak field regime , keeping only the lowest order terms we get id_b(p ) .",
    "+    the phenomenological lagrangian corresponding to @xmath0 interaction can be written as @xcite = -g_^.(_)+g_^2 ( ) .",
    "( ) , where the boldfaced @xmath3 and @xmath27 indicate that they are isovectors . expanding the lagrangian with complex pseudo - scalar and vector fields , one can easily get the possible one - loop self - energy diagrams as shown in fig.1 . in the following calculation we ignore the mass difference between neutral @xmath27 meson and the charged @xmath27 and",
    "denote the pion mass as @xmath28 .",
    "sometimes the superscript indices denoting neutral and charged @xmath3 will be written downstairs for aesthetic reasons .",
    "the part of the interaction lagrangian which is responsible for the neutral @xmath3 meson self - energy can be explicitly written as _ _ 0 = i g_[_0^(-^-_^++_^-^+)]+g_^2_0 ^ 2 ^ -^+ .",
    "from which one can find the vertex factor for sub - diagram ( a ) to be @xmath29 and that for sub - diagram ( c ) to be @xmath30 .",
    "one loop self - energy for @xmath31 meson is given by -i^__0&= & + ^__0 & = & i g^2 _ , where d_b(p ) = d_0(p ) -(eb)^2 , and @xmath32^{-1}$ ] is the free scaler propagator .",
    "it is to be noted here that , as the vacuum part and the magnetic correction term of the propagator are additive , the one loop self - energy of @xmath31 can be decomposed into two parts as ^_^0 & = & ^_^0(eb=0)+ ^_^0(eb0 ) .",
    "this is true for the charged @xmath3 mesons as well .",
    "after dimensional regularization and renormalization , the vacuum part of the self energy which is finite and scale dependent , can be written as @xcite ^_^0(eb=0)&=&-(g^-)_vac(k^2 ) + _ vac(k^2)&=&k^2 , where @xmath33 contains the mass scale and can be fixed by an additional condition based on physical grounds . although @xmath33 is a constant in case of pure vacuum , however in the presence of magnetic field , the additional condition makes it in principle a function of @xmath5 as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we denote the renormalized mass of @xmath3 meson as @xmath34 whereas the magnetic field dependent effective mass is denoted as @xmath35 .    in this work",
    "we are mainly concerned with the @xmath5 dependent one loop self - energy up to @xmath36 which is reasonable in the weak field regime . after plugging in the propagators explicitly ,",
    "the expression for the magnetic field dependent part of neutral @xmath3 meson self - energy becomes ^_^0(eb0)&=&-i(eb)^2g^2_[form ] .",
    "+    thus , we have altogether three integrals .",
    "standard feynman parametrization technique can be applied to these integrals one by one . starting with the first one we find    & & ( 2p+k)^(2p+k)^ + & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx4(1-x)^3 + & & .",
    "[ eqnappendics ] it is worth mentioning that out of all the terms that emerge after the change of variable @xmath37 , the bracketed terms are the only non - vanishing ones .",
    "necessary identities for all the momentum integrations are given in the appendix .",
    "interestingly , one can skip the tenure of the calculation for the second integral by noticing that @xmath38 transforms it exactly to the first one . combining the contribution from the third integral with the first two , we find the following structure for the one - loop self energy of neutral @xmath3 meson : _ ^0^ & = & ^_^0(eb=0 ) + a_0k^k^+ b_0g^+c_0g_^+d_0(k^k_^+ k^k_^ ) [ selfenergy ] with the structure functions given as follows : a_0 & = & _ 0 ^ 1dx(1-x)^3(1 - 2x ) + b_0 & = & + c_0 & = & - _ 0 ^ 1dx + d_0 & = & _ 0 ^ 1dx where @xmath39 . note the @xmath26 term in the expression which takes into account its presence in all the feynman propagators , not explicitly mentioned earlier . in certain kinematic domain ( like @xmath40 where the unitary cut begins ) , the structure constants can have significant real and imaginary parts .    in case of @xmath2 mesons",
    "the contributing interaction lagrangian is given by @xmath41 following similar procedure , magnetic field dependent self - energy of @xmath2 up to @xmath15 can be written as ^_^&= & i g^2 _ + & = & -i(eb)^2g^2 _ from this structure one can straightforwardly conclude that _ ^^ & = & ^_^(eb=0 ) + a_k^k^+ b_g^+c_g_^+d_(k^k_^+ k^k_^ ) , where structure functions @xmath42 are nothing but half of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the decay width of @xmath45 in presence of magnetic field is related to the imaginary part of the self - energy as @xcite _",
    "( eb)&=&[decay ]    where @xmath46 is defined in the rest frame of @xmath3 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the solution of the equation m^^2-m_^2+(k_0= m^,eb)&= & 0[mast ]    for a given value of @xmath5 , @xmath48 gives the maximum of the spectral function which is defined as ( k_0,eb)&= & note that , being a function of both @xmath49 and @xmath50 it carries all the essential features of the self - energy .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results for the variation of the effective mass with weak external magnetic field .",
    "we consider the strength of the external field to be much less than the square of the @xmath3 meson mass i.e @xmath51 . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we have taken the coupling constant @xmath52 as 6.03 which can be obtained by using the decay width of @xmath45 as 150 mev .",
    "the mass of the pion is taken as 0.14 gev.to get the effective mass numerically , we set the external three momentum of eq.([dispersion ] ) to zero and obtain four mass relations given by -m_^2+a k_0 ^ 2+b&=&0 + k_0 ^ 2-m_^2-_vac(k_0 ^ 2)+ b - c&=&0 + k_0 ^ 2-m_^2-_vac(k_0 ^ 2)+ b - c&=&0 + k_0 ^ 2-m_^2-_vac(k_0 ^ 2)+ b&=&0 it must be noted here that for a given value of the parameter @xmath5 each of the equations possess two unknowns , @xmath53 and the scale hidden in @xmath54 .",
    "it might seem that the scale is already fixed by the condition employed at @xmath55 which is @xmath56 .",
    "but the physical mass in presence of magnetic field is @xmath57 and not the vacuum mass @xmath34 .",
    "thus we must choose a more general condition @xmath58 which correctly reproduces the vacuum results in absence of @xmath5 . using the above condition we get the following mass relations    -m_^2+am_^2+b&=&0 + m_^2-m_^2 + b - c&=&0 + m_^2-m_^2 + b - c&=&0 + m_^2-m_^2 + b&=&0 where the subscripts of @xmath59 and @xmath35 are chosen accordingly .",
    "out of the four relations , the first one gives unphysical mode whereas the second and third one being same , are denoted as mode-1 with the last one denoted as mode-2 . in both of the cases ,",
    "we find that the effective mass of @xmath1 as well as @xmath11 decreases with @xmath5 as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .    to understand the connection between the modes and the spin states explicitly",
    ", one should note that , in the rest frame of a massive vector particle , the completeness relation satisfied by the polarization vectors is given as ^3_s=1_s^_s^&=&-g^+u^u^where _",
    "1^(*k*)&=&(0,1,i,0 ) + _ 2^(*k*)&=&(0,1,-i,0 ) + _ 3^(*k*)&=&(0,0,0,1 ) + u^&=&(1,0,0,0 ) . using the completeness relation , the self - energy function in eq.([selfenergy ] ) can be decomposed in terms of the projection operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 . inverting eq.([invprop ] ) one gets the one loop corrected propagator as d^&=&+ + & + & + .",
    "this form of the propagator simply indicates that mode-1 physically represents the spin state @xmath62 whereas @xmath63 is represented by mode-2 .",
    "although we started with the same physical mass for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 which is 770 mev , in both the modes , their effective masses vary differently showing faster decrease for @xmath64 compared to @xmath65 .",
    "however , if we compare the variations in the two modes by plotting the ratio of the effective masses as a function of @xmath5 ( shown in the inset ) , we observe a difference between them which is in fact , relatively more prominent in case of @xmath1 .",
    "the decreasing nature indicates the possibility of @xmath3 condensation for higher magnetic fields .",
    "it also indicates that the critical field for @xmath1 meson should be smaller in magnitude compared to that for charged @xmath3 .",
    "however , as we are working in weak field regime , the prediction about the critical field @xmath66 is beyond the scope of our approximation .",
    "it is to be noted here that we find non - zero effective mass for @xmath11 even at @xmath67 @xmath68 which differs from that predicted in ref.@xcite . comparing with lattice results in ref.@xcite",
    ", we find that our results agree in case of @xmath1 with @xmath63 , @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath13 .",
    "these are the states for which @xmath3 mass decreases with the magnetic field . in rest of the cases ,",
    "increase in @xmath5 also increases the mass .",
    "+   +   +    in case of dispersion relations , without any loss of generality we can reorient our axes such that @xmath72 becomes @xmath73 . now ,",
    "fixing the value of one of the independent variables in @xmath74 , we can find the variation of @xmath75 with respect to the other . in fig.[fig.4 ]",
    "the first column shows the variation of @xmath75 as a function of @xmath76 with @xmath77 gev . the mode energy increases with the increase of longitudinal momentum in all the three modes tending to coincide with the vacuum for higher @xmath76 values .",
    "this behaviour is plausible because , for @xmath78 the magnetic corrections do not contribute significantly resulting in light like dispersion .",
    "similar behaviour can be observed from the second column where @xmath79 is varied keeping the longitudinal momentum fixed at 0.3 gev . with the increase of @xmath5 from 0.1 to 0.2 @xmath68 , one can notice the downward shift of the dispersion curves in all the three modes .    to calculate the decay width and spectral function in the rest frame of @xmath3",
    ", we need to know the imaginary parts of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the imaginary parts of those structure functions can be obtained analytically and are given as follows [ a ] & = & -(eb)^2 + -[b]&=&-(eb)^2 + -[c]&=&-(eb)^2 where the expressions are scaled by the overall common factor @xmath82 for @xmath1 and half of that for @xmath11 . using the definition given in eq.([decay ] )",
    "we obtain the decay width for @xmath45 as shown in the left panel of fig.[fig.5 ] .",
    "it has been found that @xmath83 decreases with the external magnetic field both for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , the rate of decrease being small , it     +    never vanishes even for @xmath84 which we have taken to be the maximum limit of the external field as mentioned earlier .",
    "the fact indicates that , in the weak field limit , there exists suppression in the decay channel of @xmath45 but the prediction for complete blockage of the channel is beyond the scope of its applicability .",
    "spectral functions are plotted in the right panel with two non - zero values of @xmath5 . as soon as the magnetic field",
    "is turned on , the vacuum spectral function splits into two , corresponding to different self - energies of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is the interplay between @xmath53 and @xmath5 dependencies of im@xmath85 which makes the spectral function narrower and taller as it shifts towards the condensation .",
    "the shift is the manifestation of decreasing @xmath48 which is the @xmath53 value corresponding to the maximum of the spectral function .",
    "these features of the spectral function are consistent with the qualitative discussions given in @xcite . however , unlike @xcite , the shift for @xmath1 in our case is more in comparison with that of @xmath2 which is expected from our results of @xmath86 and @xmath83 .",
    "in this work we have investigated the charged and neutral @xmath3 meson condensation in external magnetic field .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the weak field regime and used the series form of the scalar propagator in magnetic background taking into consideration the leading order magnetic correction term .",
    "starting from the phenomenological lagrangian , we explicitly calculated the magnetic correction to the one - loop self energy up to @xmath15 . using the standard dyson - schwinger equation , we have calculated the effective mass variations for @xmath1 and @xmath11 . in this case",
    "we find two independent physical modes both of them showing decreasing nature which indicates the possibility of @xmath3 condensation .",
    "however , because of our restriction to the weak field regime , we can not predict the exact value of critical field at which the effective mass vanishes but we do find non - zero @xmath65 for @xmath67 gev .",
    "the trend shows that critical field for @xmath3 meson ( both @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) will be higher than the prediction made in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in our case @xmath1 mass falls faster than @xmath2 with increasing @xmath87 which differs from the result of liu et al @xcite .",
    "in addition to that we have also presented the modified dispersion relations of @xmath3 meson for three distinct modes .",
    "imaginary parts of the structure functions have been obtained analytically .",
    "we have also explicitly calculated the spectral function for the first time .",
    "the shift in the spectral function with the increasing magnetic field is in agreement with what has been anticipated in @xcite based on qualitative arguments .",
    "another important difference of our work in comparison with that of ref.@xcite is that , in njl model , the quarks are affected by the magnetic field .",
    "that means the magnetically corrected propagators appearing in the self - energy should be fermionic propagators .",
    "but in our case , pionic fields contribute to the @xmath3 self - energy .",
    "thus bosonic propagators contain the magnetic corrections .",
    "now , the essential difference between the two is that in weak field expansion , fermionic propagators possess corrections of @xmath5 order @xcite but in case of bosons , the leading order correction is @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "thus , one can expect that no @xmath5 order correction can be introduced with it .",
    "it is true that depending upon the interactions , even if one uses @xmath88 corrected fermionic propagators , leading order contribution to self - energy may not be of @xmath88@xcite .",
    "however , the discussions in @xcite clearly indicates that at least in case of @xmath89 with @xmath62 , magnetic correction of @xmath88 exists and it is the only mode for which decrease in mass has been observed .",
    "our spin decomposition in the rest frame is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we are also not considering the lll approximation .",
    "thus we find that the possibility of observation of @xmath3 meson condensation in weak magnetic field depends upon the interaction terms used in the lagrangian and undoubtedly demands further investigation .    at this point",
    "it is necessary to mention that our phenomenological lagrangian considers only the @xmath0 interaction which takes into account , in fact , the largest decay channel(@xmath90 100 percent ) of rho meson which is @xmath45 .",
    "nevertheless , because of its simplicity , our phenomenological lagrangian can be implemented at finite temperature calculations as well , which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we list all the identities necessary to perform the momentum integrations of eq.([eqnappendics ] ) .",
