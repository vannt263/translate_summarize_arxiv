    "light - front ( lf ) coordinates are natural coordinates for studying many high energy scattering processes , since such processes are often dominated by correlations along light - like directions @xcite . for recent reviews on this subject ,",
    "see for example refs .",
    "@xcite    the lf framework is very useful also for studying low - energy , nonperturbative physics such as bound states because field theories quantized on the light - front have the vacuum which appears to be trivial ( at least as long as zero - mode degrees of freedom are neglected ) . but how can the lf trivial vacuum incorporate with non - trivial structures ( e.g. , spontaneous symmetry breaking ) of the vacuum ? presumably all the vacuum structures would be extracted from the zero - mode dynamics , if we could correctly take it into account .",
    "it is unfortunately extremely difficult to do it . on the other hand",
    ", there exists now plenty of evidence that there is no conflict between trivial vacua on the lf and nontrivial vacua in an equal time formulation @xcite , _ provided _ one works and interprets the lf hamiltonian as an effective hamiltonian in which zero - mode degrees of freedom have been integrated out ( as opposed to just ommitted ) .",
    "the point is that it seems that effects of the zero mode dynamics can really be simulated by a set of `` counterterms , '' though their precise forms and the strengths are not easily determined .",
    "nevertheless , it is still common lore that such an effective lf hamiltonian approach is not sufficient to account for topologically nontrivial effects .",
    "in particular it is generally assumed that @xmath0 vacua in the lf framework can only be described if the zero - modes of the gauge field are included as dynamical degrees of freedom @xcite .    in order to investigate this issue",
    ", we are investigating the massive schwinger model which is known to have @xmath0 vacua @xcite and where the properties of mesons are dependant on the value of @xmath0 @xcite . in the equal time formulation of the model",
    ", there are ( at least ) two complementary approaches to describe the physics of @xmath0 vacua : on the one hand , one can formulate the model on a finte interval with periodic boundary conditions and introduce dynamical zero - mode degrees of freedom for the gauge field @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the parameter @xmath0 appears in a way very similar to the lattice momentum in bloch waves familiar from solid state physics . on the other hand",
    ", one can interpret @xmath0 as an external field , generated by `` intergalactic capacitor plates '' at infinity @xcite . in the latter approach , where the 1 + 1 dimensional world is not a circle but the infinite line ,",
    "@xmath0 is not a dynamical degree of freedom , but instead appears as an integration constant when solving poisson s equation .",
    "lf formulations of @xmath0-vacua in the schwinger model which put the system in a box with periodic boundary conditions and where the @xmath0 vacuum is constructed as a bloch state can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath2 ) and @xcite ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "one finds that @xmath0 vacua can be understood as zero - mode dynamics and @xmath0 plays the role of a bloch momentum .",
    "in particular , the periodicity of the physics in @xmath0 can be quite easily understood , though it is due to non - trivial dynamics ( pair creation ) . even though the vacuum and meson equations have been obtained , spectra and wave functions",
    "have not been calculated explicitly because the continuum limit of the equations is singular ( or ambigous ) .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have an alternate formulation which allows to perform explicit calculations .",
    "the approach to @xmath0 vacua in the lf formulation which we will pursue in this paper is complementary to the `` bloch wave approach '' described above and is in fact very similar to coleman s formulation of the problem in an equal time framework : we introduce the @xmath0 parameter as an external field , generated by external charges at infinity and then we study the behavior of mesons under the influence of such an external field . the paper is organized as follows : first we derive the effective interaction term caused by such an external electric field . in the rest of the paper",
    "we investigate the influence of this field on mesons by approximating mesons as fermion  anti - fermion pairs . in particular , we study the boundary behavior of meson wave - functions , screening effects and the chiral limit of the model .",
    "let us start with the lagrangian of the massive schwinger model @xmath4\\psi.\\ ] ] we quantize the model on the light - cone , i.e. , by regarding @xmath5 as the `` time . '' in the @xmath6 gauge ,",
    "equations of motion can be derived in the usual way . in particular , we find that @xmath7 satisfies the following poisson equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10",
    ". for the notation used in this paper , see ref.@xcite .",
    "following coleman , we introduce the @xmath0 parameter into the massive schwinger model as an external background field by including an appropriate integration constant in the solution to eq.([poisson ] ) , @xmath11 yielding an additional interaction term in the lf hamiltonian ] when @xmath12 . ]",
    "@xmath13    in momentum space , this additional term appears as the derivative of the current operator at zero momentum , i.e. , @xmath14 where for @xmath15 @xmath16 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int_0^{q^+ } \\!\\!\\!{dk^+\\over 2\\pi\\sqrt{k^+(q^+-k^+ ) } } b^\\dagger(k^+ ) d^\\dagger(q^+-k^+ ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & j^+_{diag}+j^+_{pair } \\label{eq : j+}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and analogously for @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the usual destruction operators for fermions and anti - fermions respectively and , by definition , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are those terms in the current operator which are diagonal ( off - diagonal ) in fock space .",
    "the contributions of @xmath20 to @xmath22 [ eq . ( [ eq : p- ] ) ]",
    "are straightforward to evaluate , yielding @xmath23 , \\label{eq : p - naive}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , a derivative coupling with opposite signs for fermions and anti - fermions .",
    "how can @xmath21 in @xmath22 affect the meson state ? first observe that the ( anti-)fermion must have non - zero momentum @xmath24 in order for @xmath25 to contribute . because wave functions in the massive schwinger model vanish when one of the momenta goes to zero",
    ", one might think that @xmath25 with @xmath26 ( hence @xmath27 ) is unimportant .",
    "however , we can show that they do not vanish when the momenta of a fermion and an anti - fermion go to zero _",
    "simultaneously_. the details of the argument will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this letter we will restrict ourselves to analyzing the consequences for the coupling of a meson to a constant background field .    in order to investigate whether this has a nontrivial effect on the matrix elements of @xmath28 ,",
    "let us consider the matrix elements of @xmath29 for small but nonzero momentum transfer .",
    "as an example , compare the two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : j+ ] , which contribute to the coupling of a fermion to an external charge .",
    "1.cm    ( 15,7.)(.5,-8.5 )    fig .",
    "[ fig : j+]a is just the bare tree level coupling , yielding @xmath30 while the one loop diagram [ fig .",
    "[ fig : j+]b ] yields @xmath31 ( since we are interested in static external sources , we may neglect @xmath32 in @xmath33 ) . clearly , eq . ( [ eq : vb ] ) is of the same order in @xmath24 as eq .",
    "( [ eq : va ] ) and may thus not be neglected  even in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the bad news is that even for small @xmath24 , pair creation terms can not be neglected in the matrix elements of the current operator .",
    "however , the good news is that for @xmath26 ( which is the case we are interested in for the coupling to an external constant electric field ) the relevant contribution can be calculated from vacuum polarization diagrams only .",
    "the nonperturbative contribution from all vacuum polarization diagrams can be summed up by inserting a complete set of meson states , yielding @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the wave function of the n - th meson with mass @xmath38 in the two particle sector .",
    "thus while it is incorrect to leave out couplings of the external current which are off - diagonal in fock space current which is affected by this result in a multi - flavor version of the model . ] , we can take them into account effectively by renormalizing the all couplings to the external field according to the rule @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{eq : thetaeff}\\ ] ] at the same time , all matrix elements that are off - diagonal in fock - space may be omitted ( this is what makes the effective interaction effective ) , i.e. we find the amazingly simple result that the naive interaction term ( [ eq : p - naive ] ) becomes correct provided one replaces @xmath0 by @xmath40 .    note that the diagrams with a `` chain '' of vacuum polarizations ending at the external source are special in the sense that such diagrams are not generated by the usual perturbation theory with @xmath22 as the perturbation .",
    "it is the interplay of @xmath22 and the ( so - called `` fork '' ) interactions already in the hamiltonian that generates these diagrams .",
    "it is however still true that the whole set of these diagrams vanishes when @xmath41 .    as a side remark",
    ", we should emphasize that in principle the screening factor @xmath42 itself depends on @xmath40 since it is @xmath40 which enters the lf - hamiltonian and thus determines the masses and coupling constants of mesons that appear in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetaeff ] ) .",
    "however , we will neglect this effect here and evaluate the screening factor at @xmath43 , which will effectively limit the validity of our results to small values of @xmath0 .",
    "in order to illustrate the physics of the @xmath0 parameter , let us now focus our attention to the 2-particle sector of the massive schwinger model , which is known to provide an excellent approximation for the lightest meson @xcite .",
    "after projecting the effective lf hamiltonian in the presence of an external background field onto the two particle sector , one finds the following equation of motion for mesons @xmath44 where a principal value prescription for the singular integral is implied . here and in the following we will use units where @xmath45 .",
    "the most dramatic modification compared to the bergknoff hamiltonian ( @xmath43 ) is that above hamiltonian is complex ( but still hermitian ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions satisfy @xmath46 which results from charge conjugation invariance . at the boundary @xmath47",
    "a self - consistent ansatz shows that @xmath48 vaishes like @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , where @xmath51 is the solution to @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "obviously eq .",
    "( [ eq : bbb ] ) can be satisfied if and only if one allows @xmath51 to be complex . for @xmath54",
    "one recovers t hooft s boundary condition @xmath55 @xcite , which has only real solutions @xmath56 located at @xmath57 . for the end - point behavior",
    "only @xmath58 is important . in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss how @xmath56  the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bbb ] ) change as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "detailled proofs can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for fixed @xmath59 , as one increases @xmath40 , the imaginary part of @xmath51 increases until at a certain value @xmath60 , @xmath51 becomes purely imaginary and the solutions to the bergknoff equation with @xmath0-term become tachyonic . for @xmath61 ,",
    "one finds @xmath62 , but for @xmath63 , @xmath64 slowly decreases to zero . in the chiral limit",
    "one can see this explicitly using ( [ eq : bbb ] ) @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 yielding @xmath67",
    "for @xmath2 , the screening factor ( [ eq : thetaeff ] ) vanishes and thus @xmath68 regardless of the value of @xmath0 . since only @xmath40 enters the hamiltonian for mesons , we thus confirm that meson masses become @xmath0-independent for zero fermion masses .",
    "much more interesting is the limit of small but nonvanishing fermion masses . in this case",
    "numerical calculations of the meson spectrum become very tricky because of the singular behavior of the meson wave functions at the boundary .",
    "furthermore , especially for values of @xmath69 , pair creation ( which we are suppressing for simplicity ) is expected to become very important .    given that @xmath70 has to satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath71 and @xmath50 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath51 is determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bbb ] ) , it would be natural to make a variational ansatz of the form @xmath74 however , we have not been able to derive analytic expressions for matrix elements of the interaction with this ansatz for general ( i.e. complex ) values of @xmath51 . for @xmath75 , an ansatz which has the same end - point behavior as eq .",
    "( [ eq : bbb ] ) , and which is also [ like eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) ] nearly constant for intermediate values of @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 the main advantage of this modified ansatz is that it not only satisfies the right boundary conditions but also leads to analytically calculable matrix elements , using @xcite @xmath78 \\label{eq : int}\\ ] ] for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) one thus finds @xmath81 \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^\\beta   \\label{eq : megav } \\\\   & & + \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin ( \\pi \\beta^ * ) } + \\pi \\cot ( \\pi \\beta^ * ) \\left [ \\frac{\\beta^*}{1-x}-1\\right ] \\left(\\frac{1-x}{x}\\right)^{\\beta^ * } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence for the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath82 where @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath18 real .",
    "this expression is minimized for @xmath85 which agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bchiral ] ) . substituting ( [ eq : betamin ] ) into ( [ eq : exph ] ) yields for the invariant mass of the meson @xmath86 which is valid up to order @xmath87 and for @xmath88 . in order to turn eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2var ] ) into a prediction for the @xmath0 dependence of the mass , we need to evaluate the schreening factor ( [ eq : thetaeff ] ) . for this purpose , we note that @xmath89 which , by completeness @xmath90 , also implies that @xmath91 as a result , up to @xmath92 , screening depends only on the mass shift of the meson , i.e. @xmath93 to lowest order in @xmath0 , one thus immediately obtains @xmath94 yielding @xmath95 which agrees to this order in @xmath0 with the result from bosonization @xcite @xmath96 within 2 %",
    ".    one might suspect that the 2 % difference between eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2a ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : t2bos ] ) is just a consequence of using the `` wrong '' meson mass in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetaeff]).however , this is not the case , since the screening factor enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2a ] ) quadratically , and using @xmath97 from bosonization instead of from the bergknoff equation results in a @xmath0-dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2a ] ) which is 2 % too small instead of 2 % too large .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that understanding the 2 % puzzle in the @xmath43 case @xcite will eventually also help to understand the 2 % deviation of the @xmath0 dependent term above .    much more important than the 2 % deviation",
    "is the fact that above calculation gave the correct result within 2 %  especially since the calculation without screening corrections would have given a @xmath0 dependence which diverges as @xmath98 . only after inclusion of the screening factor",
    "did we obtain the correct @xmath59-dependence , i.e. vanishing @xmath0-dependence in the chiral limit .",
    "we consider this as a strong support for our method of including screening effects into the effective background field .",
    "once more , we should emphasize that above result ( [ eq : m2a ] ) was obtained without including dynamical zero mode degrees of freedom .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 dependence of the meson mass in the massive schwinger model .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence is introduced via a static background electric field .",
    "the essential new ingredient which we introduce is a screened background field , which arises as an effective coupling to fermion anti - fermion pairs with vanishing momentum . in the chiral limit",
    "we obtain results which are consistent with results based on chiral perturbation theory .",
    "while above results have been very reassuring , many open questions remain , including deriving the effective hamiltonian and calculating meson masses for @xmath99",
    ". such results would be particularly interesting for investigations of `` vacuum periodicity '' , which should manifest itself in the effective hamiltonian formalism as critical behavior for @xmath100 .",
