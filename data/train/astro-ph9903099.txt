    "the launch of the compton gamma - ray observatory and the major improvements to ground - based cherenkov telescopes marked the 1990s as the pivotal years in the field of astrophysics at the very highest energies .",
    "in particular , the detection of gev @xmath0rays from over 50 blazars by the egret telescope on cgro ( cf .",
    "mukherjee et al .",
    "1997 ) established them as a class of extreme `` particle accelerators ''  on two accounts : they produce the most energetic photons of any known extragalactic cosmic sources , but , assuming isotropic emission , they are also the most luminous .",
    "it is generally thought that the non - thermal emission from blazars , observed in virtually every band from radio to gev / tev @xmath0rays , is produced by very energetic particles via both synchrotron and compton processes .",
    "most of these objects are variable , showing flares with the greatest amplitude at the highest energies of each component , on time scales as short as a day .",
    "this underlines the importance of the high - energy emission for any modeling . via the @xmath0ray opacity arguments ( see , e.g. , mattox et al .",
    "1993 ) , this suggests that the @xmath0ray emission is produced in a very compact region , moving at relativistic speeds at a small angle towards the observer , most likely in a form of a jet .",
    "multi - frequency studies of blazars reveal that the overall spectra have at least two pronounced components : the low energy peak ( le ) and the high energy peak ( he ) ( see , e.g. , von montigny et al .",
    "for the blazars showing quasar - like emission lines ( qhbs ) , and for bl lac objects discovered via radio - selection techniques ( the low - energy peaked bl lac objects , or lbls ) , the le component peaks in the infrared , while in the bl lacs found using x  rays ( the high - energy peaked bl lac objects , or hbls ) , it peaks in the ultraviolet or even in soft x  rays ( see , e.g. , sambruna , maraschi , & urry 1996 ) .",
    "the he component , on the other hand , peaks in the @xmath0ray band , in the mev - to - gev range , and in the case of a few hbls , it extends to the tev range .",
    "the local power - law shape , the smooth connection of the entire radio - to - uv ( and , for the hbls , soft x  ray ) continuum , as well as the relatively high level of polarization observed from radio to the uv , implies that the emission from the le component is most likely produced via the synchrotron process by relativistic particles radiating in magnetic field .",
    "the he component is then believed to be produced via comptonization by the same particles that radiate the le component .",
    "the source of the `` seed '' photons can be the synchrotron radiation internal to the jet  as in the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models ( rees 1967 ; blandford & konigl 1979 ; konigl 1981 ; ghisellini & maraschi 1989 , inoue & takahara 1996 ) .",
    "alternatively , these photons can be external to the jet , as in the external radiation compton ( erc ) models : either the uv accretion disk photons ( dermer , schlickeiser , & mastichiadis 1992 ) , or these uv photons reprocessed by the emission line clouds and/or inter - cloud medium ( sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ; blandford & levinson 1995 ) , or else , ir radiation ambient to the host galaxy ( sikora et al .",
    "the x  ray regime is important , as it is where the emission due to both processes overlap : in the context of the above scenario , in hbls , x  rays form the high energy tail of the synchrotron emission , while for qhbs , they form the lowest observable energy end of the comptonized spectrum .    the discovery of the tev emission from four nearby bl lac objects ( mkn 421 , mkn 501 , 1es2344 + 514 , and pks 2155 - 304 ) by ground based cherenkov telescopes ( punch et al .",
    "1992 ; quinn et al . 1996",
    "; catanese et al .",
    "1998 ; chadwick et al .",
    "1998 ) has given us an opportunity to study the radiation processes responsible for production of photons at such extreme energies .",
    "the first multi - frequency observation from mkn 421 from radio to tev @xmath0rays , conducted in 1994 , revealed that while the kev x  ray and tev @xmath0ray fluxes varied nearly simultaneously , the flux in other bands remained relatively steady ( macomb et al .",
    "1995 ; takahashi et al .",
    "subsequent multi - frequency campaigns for this object also revealed correlated flare activity in x ",
    "rays and tev @xmath0rays , suggesting that both kev and tev spectral regimes are produced by the same , most energetic end of an electron population , radiating via the synchrotron process in the kev band , and compton process in the tev bands . given the relative absence of emission lines in the tev - emitting hbls , the `` seed '' photons for comptonization are most likely internal to the jet , as in the ssc models .",
    "the multi - frequency spectra of hbls mkn 501 and pks 2155 - 304 are similar to that of mkn 421 : the le components of these objects peak in the x  ray band .",
    "mkn 501 showed a remarkable flare activity in april 1997 . during the multi - frequency campaign , both x  ray and tev @xmath0rays increased by more than one order of magnitude from quiescent level ( catanese et al .",
    "1997 ; pian et al . 1998 ; kataoka et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting that the same mechanism takes place as in the case of mkn 421 .",
    "however , in mkn 501 , the synchrotron emission in quiescence peaked below 0.1 kev , while during the 1997 flare , it peaked at @xmath5 100 kev .",
    "this is in contrast to mkn 421 , where the position of the le peak shows relatively little change .",
    "for pks 2155 - 304 , one of the best studied bl lac objects in other bands , the tev emission was detected only recently ( chadwick et al .",
    "1998 ) , most likely due to its southern location , and a relative lack of tev telescopes in the southern hemisphere .",
    "pks 2155 - 304 had shown very different behavior in two subsequent campaigns ( brinkmann et al .",
    "1994 ; urry et al . 1997 ; ghisellini et al . 1998 ) . here ,",
    "we report the results of _ asca _ observation of blazars in the context of their multi - frequency emission . based on the analysis of multi - frequency spectra",
    ", we discuss characteristics of tev blazars .",
    "we then review results obtained from our extensive campaigns of one of the brightest tev blazars , mkn 421 .",
    "_ asca _ observed 18 blazars , of which 10 were also observed contemporaneously with @xmath6 as parts of multi - wavelength campaigns , and these show a clear difference in the spectra and variability between hbls , lbls , and qhbs .",
    "we constructed the multi - frequency spectral energy distributions for these 18 sources and performed multi - frequency analysis to study fundamental parameters in the emission from blazars ( kubo 1997 ; takahashi et al .",
    "1997 ; kubo et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter ktm98 ) .",
    "two examples of blazar spectra plotted in @xmath2 representation ( giving the emitted power per decade of energy under an assumption of isotropic emission ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "one is of mkn 421 ( macomb et al .",
    "1995 ; takahashi et al .",
    "1996a ) , a fairly typical hbl ; its x  ray spectrum is soft ( steep ) and on the extrapolation of the ultraviolet , suggesting that the synchrotron emission extends into the x  ray range .",
    "the other is pks 0528 + 134 ( ktm98 ) , a strong lined qhb ; in contrast to mkn 421 , the x  ray spectrum of pks 0528 + 134 is harder than the uv spectrum , implying that the x ",
    "rays form the onset of the second , he component .",
    "the _ asca _ x  ray spectra of hbls are the softest , with the power law energy index @xmath7 .",
    "the x  ray spectra of the qhbs are the hardest ( @xmath8 ) . for lbls ,",
    "the spectra are intermediate ; in one case , 0716 + 714 , the spectrum shows hardening with an increasing energy .",
    "the differences in the spectra between subclasses were also observed with @xmath9 in the soft x ",
    "ray band ( sambruna et al . 1996 ; urry et al . 1997 ; sambruna 1997 ; padovani , giommi , & fiore 1997 ; comastri et al .",
    "1997 ) . while for hbls",
    ", the spectral index often varies with intensity on a time scale shorter than a week , for qhbs , it remains almost constant when the flux changes .",
    "in the very broadest sense , the overall spectra of blazars can be characterized by four parameters : the peak frequency of the synchrotron and compton components ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and luminosity of each component ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , calculated in the observer s frame , and assuming isotropy of emission ) .",
    "2 shows the distribution of the ratio @xmath13/@xmath12 as a function of the peak of the le component of the blazars considered by ktm98 . in qhbs ,",
    "the ratio is much higher than that obtained from hbls . in the context of the synchrotron model , @xmath10 and @xmath12",
    "are determined by the intensity of the magnetic field and the distribution function of electron energies .",
    "similarly , in the context of the compton model , @xmath11 and @xmath13 are related to the distribution functions of electron and target photon energies .",
    "below , we summarize a formalism useful for the determination of the magnetic field @xmath14 and electron lorentz factors @xmath15 , following that presented in takahashi et al .",
    "( 1996a ) and in ktm98 .    when the radiation is due to a single population of relativistic electrons with a broken power law distribution of @xmath15 and a break at @xmath1 , @xmath10 ( as measured in the observer s frame )",
    "is given as : @xmath16 here @xmath14 is magnetic field in gauss , measured in the comoving frame , and @xmath17 is the `` beaming '' ( doppler ) factor defined as @xmath18 .    in the case when the photons internal to the jet dominate the radiative energy density ( such as in hbls ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . if the electron energy is still in the thomson regime , ( @xmath21 ) , the expected peak of the ssc component is @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath23 to @xmath12 is then determined by the intensity of magnetic field , and the distribution function of electron energies ; it can be expressed as : @xmath24 , where the @xmath25 is the energy density of the synchrotron photons , and @xmath26 is magnetic field energy density . the beaming factor ( @xmath27 )",
    "is then given from above equations : @xmath28    an application of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model to the overall spectral distribution and variability data of 18 blazars observed by _",
    "_ implies that for the hbls , the ssc model can indeed explain all available data quite well .",
    "importantly , at least for mkn 421 , the parameters derived from it are in close agreement with those independently inferred from the spectral variability observed in the x  ray band by _ asca _ ( see sec . 4.1 below ) .",
    "the model implies relativistic doppler factors @xmath27 in the range of 5  20 , consistent with those derived from the vlbi data and from the limits inferred from @xmath0ray opacity to pair production , @xmath29 .",
    "the situation in qhbs ( and in some lbls ) is quite different . in the x  ray band observed by _",
    "( 0.7  10 kev ) , the qhbs have spectra that are hard , with @xmath30 , and which are _ not _ located on the extrapolation of the synchrotron optical / uv spectra , but also apparently disjoint from the gev he component ( cf .",
    "pks 0528 + 134 in fig .  1 ) , suggesting that x ",
    "rays are likely to be due to a separate spectral component from gev @xmath0rays .",
    "the application of the ssc model ( thus assuming @xmath31 is solely due to the ssc component ) implies that the values of @xmath27 derived from eq .",
    "2 are much in excess of values inferred from the @xmath0ray opacity arguments or the vlbi data ( for details , see ktm98 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be eliminated if we adopt a scenario where the observed gev @xmath0rays are produced by comptonization of external photons ( via the erc process ) , while the gev ssc flux is well below the erc emission , and thus `` hidden '' . in our analysis , we assumed that the the x  ray emission is produced via the ssc process , while the _ observed _ gev @xmath0rays are produced by the erc process .    in the context of this three - component scenario",
    ", we assume that the peak of the `` hidden '' ssc component can be still parameterized by @xmath23 and @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath32 lie on or below the extrapolation of the _ asca _ spectrum , but above the highest value of @xmath33 measured within the _ asca _ band .",
    "since the spectra of qhbs generally have @xmath34 , the value of @xmath35 is the highest at the end of the _ asca _ bandpass ( at 10 kev @xmath36 2@xmath3710@xmath38hz ) ( see fig .  3 in ktm98 ) .",
    "further constraints arise from eq .",
    "2 : for an object with the observed @xmath12 and @xmath39 , a selection of @xmath27 sets a unique relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath32 such that @xmath40 . since the vlbi data and @xmath0ray opacity arguments suggest that 5 @xmath41 20 for most blazars",
    "( e.g. vermeulen & cohen 1994 ; dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) , we adopt the values of 5 and 20 as lower and upper limits for @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath32 are then constrained to be inside the region defined from these conditions ( for details , see ktm98 ) .",
    "once we obtain @xmath23 , and @xmath32 , we can calculate the strength of the magnetic field @xmath14 as follows :    @xmath42    and @xmath1 is then calculated using eq . 1 .",
    "using the size of the emitting region estimated from the observed time variability via @xmath43 / @xmath44 , we infer @xmath14 to be 0.05 @xmath5 1 gauss ( using @xmath27 = 10 ) ; @xmath14 appears to be roughly similar for the two classes , but perhaps somewhat lower for hbls than for qhbs . with these values of @xmath14",
    ", we estimate @xmath1 to be lower , 10@xmath45 ",
    "@xmath46 for qhbs  where the le component peaks at lower frequencies ( @xmath47  @xmath48 hz )  and higher , @xmath49 ",
    "@xmath50 for hbls , where @xmath51 is at @xmath52  @xmath53 hz .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , which shows the correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the hbls preferentially occupy the right side of the diagram .",
    "this picture is consistent with the fact that the tev emission has been observed only from the hbls which turned out to have higher @xmath15 .",
    "this is because the energy conservation ( or , equivalently , the klein - nishina limit ) requires that lorentz factors @xmath0 of @xmath54 are the minimum necessary to produce tev photons . in the case of mkn 421 ,",
    "the knowledge of @xmath1 allows us to calculate the energy of the `` seed '' low energy photons @xmath55 via the standard compton formula @xmath56 . for the tev ( @xmath57 hz )",
    "radiation to be produced by compton scattering , @xmath55 ( as measured in the observer s frame ; we assumed @xmath58 ) must be around 0.1 - 1 ev .",
    "interestingly , this means that the `` seed '' photons have _ lower _ frequency than @xmath51 , where the energy density of the observed radiation spectrum peaks ( around 0.1  1 kev ) .",
    "as we argued above , for qhbs , where dense external radiation fields exist , the erc emission most likely contributes more significantly than the ssc emission in the gev @xmath0ray band ( see , e. g. , sikora et al .",
    "this suggests that the difference of @xmath1 between qhbs and hbls can well be due to the larger total photon density in the jets of qhbs as compared with that of hbls . in any case",
    ", these simple estimates can be refined only by introducing a detailed model of the jet , including its dynamics as well as its surroundings .",
    "recently , ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) performed detailed fitting based on the ssc and erc model to multi - frequency spectra and obtained the same conclusion in that hbls have higher @xmath15 than qhbs .",
    "among the gev - emitting blazars , the bl lac object mkn 421 is unique as the first  and so far , the brightest  member where the @xmath0ray emission extends up to the tev energies at a level allowing detailed spectral and variability studies in the broadest range of wave bands .",
    "the simple continuum spectra of mkn 421 from the radio to the uv and x  ray bands obtained previously imply that the emission from the le component is due to the distribution of charged particles radiating via the synchrotron process ( see , e.g. , george , warwick , & bromage 1988 ) . at tev energies , flares with variability time scale as short as 15 minutes have been observed ( gaidos et al .",
    "1996 ) . in order to avoid absorption of @xmath0rays due to pair production",
    ", this fast variability requires a beaming factor @xmath59 9 .",
    "study of variability patterns and the spectral evolution across different energy bands are the best ( and perhaps the only ) means to draw a general picture of non - thermal emission from blazars .",
    "the first multi - frequency observation from radio to tev @xmath0rays , conducted in 1994 , revealed a tev flare detected by the _",
    "_ observatory ( kerrick et al . 1995 ) , while the gev @xmath0ray flux observed by _",
    "egret _ was nearly constant .",
    "the 24 hr _ asca _",
    "observation , started one day after the onset of the tev flare , recorded a high level of 2  10 kev x  ray flux peaking at 3.7 @xmath3710@xmath60 ergs @xmath61 s@xmath62 , a 10-fold increase over the may 1993 value ( takahashi et al .",
    "the flux level at other wavelengths such as radio and uv was roughly the same as that observed in the quiescent level ( macomb et al .",
    "the time history of mkn 421 obtained from _",
    "observation is shown in fig .  4 , together with the change of the hardness ratio . the gev flux measured by _ egret _ ( macomb et al . 1995 ) and the flux above 500 gev measured by _ whipple",
    "_ telescope ( kerrick et al . 1995 ) are also shown in the figure .",
    "the doubling time scale is about a half day .",
    "the 1994 _ asca _ observation revealed that the x  ray flux variability in mkn 421 is correlated with the spectral changes such that the spectrum is generally harder when the source is brighter . in particular , the hard x ",
    "rays changed _ first _ , followed by changes to the soft x ",
    "ray flux , implying a `` clockwise motion '' in the flux vs photon index plane ( cf .",
    "fig .  7 ) .",
    "such behavior is typical at least for this particular bl lac object and has been seen during earlier x  ray observations ( cf .",
    "tashiro 1992 ) .",
    "high sensitivity measurements by _ asca _ allowed us for the first time to quantify the `` soft lag . ''",
    "we measure the lag in several energy bands as compared to the 2  7.5 kev band using the cross correlation function of edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  5",

    "rays by about 1 hour .    with the knowledge of @xmath27  which we assume to be at least 5  the discovery of the soft x  ray lag allows us to calculate the magnetic field from consideration of the synchrotron lifetime ( cooling ) of the relativistic electrons .",
    "the delay of the response of the soft x ",
    "ray flux implies that this may be due to the electron cooling effect , which is energy - dependent : the time @xmath63 when an electron loses a half of its energy would roughly be ( in the observer s frame ) @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 s ( cf .",
    "rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",

    "theoretical interpretation of the clockwise motion has been discussed in kirk et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and dermer ( 1998 ) , in terms of the balance between time scales of electron cooling and expansion of the emitting region .      in 1995 , the x  ray observations started almost simultaneously with the rise of the tev flare ( buckley et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the campaign , short observations of 8  10 ks with _",
    "asca _ were spaced between 1 to 3 days apart , such that it covered the tev observations ( takahashi et al .",
    "main aim was to monitor long term stability , rather than the short term behavior we obtained in 1994 . the normalized light curve obtained from the summed sis0 and sis1 data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "6 , together with tev data ( buckley et al . 1996 ) , euv data ( kartje et al . 1996 ) and optical data ( wagner 1996 ) .",
    "the variations shown on fig .",
    "6 are fairly similar in shape in all four energy bands .",
    "although the peak - to peak amplitude is only 10 % in the optical band , mkn 421 shows variations which appear to be correlated over an energy range of 13 decades of frequency , the widest energy range over which such simultaneous changes have been observed so far .",
    "the x  ray emission does track ( including the relative amplitude ) the general rise and decline seen in the tev @xmath0rays .",
    "it is clear , however , that the variability of the x  ray flux has two components , one on a @xmath5 one - day time scale as detected in the x  ray flare in 1994 ( takahashi et al .",
    "1996a ) and the other on a @xmath5 one - week time scale .",
    "the best continuous coverage of the flare was obtained by _ euve _ which resolved the smooth rise and full of the flux , with variability of as much as a factor of @xmath51.5 over a span of @xmath5 2 days ( kartje et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the x  ray flux was at a similar level to that obtained in the x ",

    "7 ( which also shows the 1994 data ) .",
    "there is a general tendency , both in one - day observation ( 1994 ) and two - weeks observation ( 1995 ) , that the spectrum becomes soft when the source is faint . in both 1994 and 1995 observations , the x",
    " ray spectra steepen towards higher energies and a single power - law function and the absorbing column @xmath83 fixed at the galactic value does not fit any of the spectra well .",
    "instead , the peak frequency appears to shift from @xmath5 1.4 kev to @xmath5 0.7 kev when the flux decreases ( cf . fig .",
    "again , there was a spectral variability within each `` sub - segment '' , where the harder x  rays varied faster than the soft x  rays .",
    "however , we could not obtain the time - lag between two energy bands due to short observation time compared with the campaign in 1994 . although the observations were not truly simultaneous , the amplitudes of the x  ray and tev @xmath0ray flux variability were nearly the same during the decay portion of the observations .",
    "judging by the results of previous campaigns which included tev observations , correlations of inter - band variability of mkn 421 have proven to provide our best opportunity to understand the high energy emission from blazar jets .",
    "in particular , the rapid intra - day variability seen in both x  ray and tev energy bands gives us clues to study the physics of blazar jets .",
    "however , the sparse sampling of the previous campaigns has prevented us from obtaining definitive conclusions .",

    "more than 10 flares are clearly seen superimposed on the general increasing trend .",
    "the doubling time scale of each flare is about 0.5 days .",
    "continuous light curve of 7 days implies that the source actually flares daily , and perhaps more often .",
    "even though mkn 421 is a bright x  ray emitter , this behavior is hard to study in any detail with the all sky monitor on board rxte : our observation demonstrated that a large and sensitive detector is indispensable for the study of variability in blazars .",
    "the x  ray light curve contains multiple flares with time scale of 0.5  1 day , superimposed on the general trend of gradually increasing flux .",
    "this is very similar to that seen in optical light curves of qhbs , where the high energy component peaks at gev @xmath0ray energy band ( wagner et al .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the largest amplitude of the rapid variability is caused by the highest energy end of the electron distribution .",
    "the synchrotron emission due to these electrons corresponds to ev range for qhbs and to kev range for hbls such as mkn 421 .",
    "a good scenario would that either the `` blob '' of plasma passed through the spatial region where shock are formed , or there is some sort of standing shock in the jet , which is much larger than a shock .",

    "10 shows the correlation between tev flux by the whipple telescope and x  ray flux by _ asca _ .",
    "it should be noted that the data were obtained from truly simultaneous observations .",
    "in addition to the correlation between 7-day _ asca _ observation , one complete flare was recorded by _ sax_and the whipple telescope in the observation carried out as a part of the 1998 campaign , but immediately preceding the _ asca _ observation ( maraschi et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "detailed analysis of the evolution of the multi - frequency spectrum and shape of flares obtained from the campaign will be presented elsewhere ( takahashi et al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "the _ asca _ data  and , specifically , the spectral variability detected with its sensitive instruments , in the context of the multi - frequency analysis  allow an investigation of the details of the emission in blazar jets , and in particular , an estimate of the physical parameters , such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "an application of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model to the overall spectral distribution and variability data for hbl - type blazars observed by _ asca _ implies that the ssc model can explain all available data quite well . in particular , the values physical parameters of the radiating plasma inferred from the energetics requirement to produce the tev @xmath0rays agree well with those inferred from the spectral variability observed in x  rays .",
    "this model implies relativistic doppler factors @xmath27 in the range of 5 - 20 , consistent with the those derived from the vlbi data and from the limits inferred from @xmath0ray opacity to pair production , @xmath29 .",
    "this is in contrast to qhbs , where the simple ssc models fail . instead , a three - component model , with the low energy peak due to synchrotron radiation , the x  ray emission produced by the ssc process , and mev / gev @xmath0ray emission due to comptonization of external radiation photons , describes the observed data well .    previous multi - frequency campaigns of mkn 421 with",
    "_ asca _ and the whipple tev telescope showed a very important connection between the x  ray and the tev energy bands .",
    "these observations are very suggestive but not conclusive because of sparse sampling during flares which occur on a time scale of @xmath86 day to one week .",
    "the great success of the big campaign conducted in 1998 is in providing valuable information about blazar jets via the measurement of spectral evolution of the emitted radiation , but , importantly , it also motivates the further development of time dependent models for the structure of blazar jets , and acceleration of particles in these jets .",

    "<S> the non - thermal spectra of blazars , observed from radio to gev / tev @xmath0rays , reveal two pronounced components , both produced by radiation by energetic particles . </S>",

    "<S> the high - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , the dominant seed photons for comptonization appear to be the synchrotron photons internal to the jet ( ssc process ) . in the quasar - hosted blazars ( qhbs ) , on the other hand , the x  ray band emission is still dominated by the ssc process , while the mev to gev range is produced by comptonization of external photons such as the emission line light . in the context of this three - component model , we derive the magnetic field of 0.1 - 1 gauss for all classes of blazars . </S>",
    "<S> lorentz factors @xmath1 of electrons radiating at each peak of the @xmath2 spectra are estimated to be @xmath3 for hbls ; this is much higher than @xmath4 for qhbs . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is consistent with the fact that the four sources that are known to emit tev @xmath0rays ( tev blazars ) are all classified as hbls . among the tev blazars , </S>",
    "<S> mkn 421 is one of the brightest and most variable emitters from ultraviolet ( ev ) to hard @xmath0ray ( tev ) energies , and its correlated inter - band variability suggests that both kev and tev spectral regimes are produced by the same , most energetic end of the electron population radiating via the synchrotron process in the kev , and the ssc process in tev band . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - frequency observations including tev energy band provide the best opportunity to understand high - energy emission from blazar jets . in this paper </S>",
