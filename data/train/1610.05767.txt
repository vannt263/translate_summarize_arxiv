    "requires us to understand how ly@xmath0  escape from galaxies .    since ly@xmath0  is a resonant line , the ly@xmath0  escape depends on the amount of dust , the hi gas column density ( @xmath3 ) , the velocity distribution of hi gas , and the geometric distribution of hi gas and dust ( e.g. neufeld 1990 ; charlot & fall 1993 ; verhamme et al .",
    "2006 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "2006 ) . one important indicator of ly@xmath0  escape processes is the ly@xmath0  spatial distribution .",

    "if most ly@xmath0  photons diffuse out of galaxy through numerous resonant scatterings , the ly@xmath0  emission would be more extended than the uv continuum ( e.g. stlin et al . 2009 ; zheng et al . 2010",

    "a single peaked ly@xmath0  velocity profile , we separate the blue - part and red - part by velocity=0 . then we extract the spatial profiles of the blue - part and red - part ly@xmath0  emission . since the blue - part is usually weaker than the red - part ly@xmath0  emission , we show the 8 of 24 green peas with the best signal - to - noise ratio in the blue - part ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "these 8 green peas also have relatively high @xmath5 .",
    "we compare their spatial profiles of blue - part and red - part ly@xmath0  emission in figure 4 .",
    "the spatial profiles of blue - part and red - part ly@xmath0  emission are generally similar . but in four cases ( gp1137@xmath603524 , gp1249@xmath601234 , gp0911@xmath601831 , and gp0926@xmath604428 ) , the blue - part ly@xmath0  emission are more extended than the red - part ly@xmath0  emission . in the other four cases ( gp1244@xmath600216 , gp1133@xmath606514 , gp1429@xmath600643 , and gp1219@xmath601526 ) , the blue - part and red - part ly@xmath0  emission are very similar .",

    "since the outflowing hi gas presented in many green peas has larger optical depth to the blue - part ly@xmath0  photons than to the red - part ly@xmath0  photons , we expect that the escaped blue - part ly@xmath0  photons went through more scatterings on average and were scattered to larger radius .",
