    "the slopes of the normality lines range from 0.194 to 0.248 ( table [ results_gcl ] ) , which is perfectly in line with values found for galactic open clusters @xcite .",
    "we notice that there seems to be a correlation with [ fe / h ] , i.e. ngc 104 with the highest metallicity exhibits the shallowest slope .",
    "however , with only three aggregates , one has to be careful with such a conclusion .",
    "further observations are clearly needed to prove this apparent correlation .    due to the photon noise ,",
    "fainter stars have , in general , larger photometric errors . inspecting the @xmath6 versus @xmath5 diagrams in fig .",
    "[ cmds ] , no correlation of the 3@xmath1 detection limit with the @xmath6 values is visible . for ngc 7099 , the detailed analysis is shown in fig .",

    "both samples are rather different in terms of the number of stars and the range of @xmath5 . in comparison with the overall solution , only one object would not be detected as peculiar in the second sample with @xmath0=+0.027mag which is just one mmag below the detection limit .",
    "in addition , we divided the other samples in different @xmath3 subsamples and calculated the 3@xmath1 detection limit anew .",
    "all values agree within 1.5mmag .",
    "those tests justify using the sample as a whole for our analysis . this strong advantage of the @xmath0 photometric system was already noticed before and is because for a given @xmath5 value , a wide range of @xmath3 values are sampled .",

    "the peculiar candidates ( fig .",
    "[ cmds ] ) are marked as filled circles.,width=302 ]        we also performed an artificial - star test to determine the completeness level of our sample which is very important when analysing crowded field photometry @xcite .",
    "normally , faint stars in very crowded regions are either lost in the saturated cores or have be detected against the high background of these bright star aureoles .",
    "thus , the magnitude limits for the detection of faint stars and the undercount correction estimates are functions of both the stellar magnitude and the distance of the objects from the most crowded and therefore bright cluster centre .",
    "as mentioned before , the inner most core parts with a radius of about 1@xmath165 were not used for our analysis . for this purpose , we added artificial stars with the iraf task ` addstar ' to frames of each filter with the longest integration times .",
    "about 100 independent experiments , each consisting of 1000 artificial stars within a 1mag interval randomly scattered throughout the image , were performed .",
    "these frames were then photometrically analysed the same way as the original ones .",
    "the detected fraction of artificial stars was determined in concentric annuli of 0@xmath165 width .",
    "finally , a weighted average of the recovery fraction at each radius and magnitude interval was computed . for ngc  6205",
    ", we got almost a 99% completeness level for all bins because we observed fields quite far off the centre .",
    "[ ats ] shows the artificial - star tests for ngc  104 and ngc  7099 .",
    "the band width of the individual curves is about @xmath173% .",
    "since almost all regions and magnitude ranges are well above 90% , we are confident that the effect of undetected binary stars do not play a significant role for our analysis . as a further test",
    ", the differences of the @xmath6 values from the artificial - star test and the observed ones were calculated .",
    "[ diff_ats ] shows these differences versus the @xmath3 magnitude and the distance from the centre for the data of ngc  7099 .",
    "again , the distribution of the outliers does not significantly alter from the apparent normal type objects .    in total ,",
    "photometric @xmath0 values for 2266 stars were secured .",
    "according to the well established 3@xmath1 detection limit , 61 stars fall above , and 29 objects below the normality line .",
    "the latter can be also due to higher reddened background stars , which would shift these objects below the normality line .",
    "the only reliable distinction could be done via membership probabilities based on proper motions .",
    "however , such kinematic data are not available for our target sample .",
    "indeed , such field stars are present in globular cluster areas @xcite .",
    "those field stars are clearly visible in the right most upper panel of fig . 5 in @xcite where they exhibit redder @xmath18 colours than the cluster members .",
    "in the @xmath0 photometric diagram , such stars could lie below the normality line , but not above it .",
    "we also checked the possibility of the influence of undetected visual companions for the outliers .",
    "in general , applying psf - fitting , already accounts for such cases .",
    "a comparison of ` visual binaries ' among normal type objects and outliers shows no significant accumulation among the latter .    to estimate the @xmath6 versus @xmath5 diagram of background / foreground stars in the field of view of our targets",
    ", we used the theoretical galactic model , trilegal 1.6 described by @xcite .",
    "it includes the populations of the thin and thick disc as well as the galactic halo but it is not able to simulate star clusters , yet .",
    "we have simulated fields of 12x12 with the central coordinates as listed in table [ parameters_gcl ] . up to now , the @xmath0 photometric system is not included in the list of systems . as workaround",
    ", we used the synthetic @xmath0 photometry taken from the vienna new model grid of stellar atmospheres , nemo @xcite .",
    "the trilegal output includes , , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath3 for each object .",
    "first of all , we restricted the sample to the @xmath3 magnitudes as deduced from fig .",
    "then , for each star , we searched for the closest model from the nemo data base and took the corresponding @xmath0 photometry .",
    "[ trilegal ] shows the observed and synthesized field of ngc  104 .",
    "the situation for the other two fields is similar .",
    "the slope for the normality line of the observational data is 0.194(4 ) whereas it is 0.196(5 ) for the synthetic data .",
    "there are a few stars below ( see discussion above ) but none above the normality line .",
    "we are , therefore , confident that fore- and background stars can not mimic a statistically significant number of peculiar globular cluster members in the @xmath6 versus @xmath5 diagram .",
    "however , some negative outliers of ngc  104 and ngc  7099 ( fig . [ cmds ] ) can be caused by field stars .",
    "_ ngc  104 : _ no significant deviating @xmath0 values for hb stars were found .",
    "about 10 outstanding objects are probable non - members and can be easily identified in the @xmath3 versus @xmath5 diagram .",
    "_ ngc  6205 : _ this is the most detailed investigated globular cluster among our targets .",
    "we measured three hb stars listed in @xcite , namely , wf2 - 820 ( no .",
    "147 ) , wf-2692 ( no . 227 ) , and wf2 - 3035 ( no .",
    "the latter shows no chemical peculiarities , whereas the other two have large overabundances of almost all iron peak elements from 1 to 1.5 dex compared to the cluster metallicity .",
    "our @xmath0 values are perfectly in line with the abundances . for wf2 - 3035",
    "we find an insignificant value of + 8 mmag , whereas the other two stars were detected with + 57 and + 60 mmag .",
    "this lends to confidence that the @xmath0 photometric system is indeed capable to detect cp hb stars .",
    "however , further observations of such objects have to prove this conclusion",
    ". there are also several bhb stars which are below the normality line .",
    "for none of these objects , membership probabilities are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "we may speculate that this behaviour could be due to photometric variations .",
    "such a behaviour is a common phenomenon for cp stars @xcite , but was never investigated for members of globular clusters , yet .    as next step , we investigated the rgb stars published by @xcite among our sample . in total",
    ", we find 10 stars in common .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] values for those objects range from @xmath190.15 to + 0.30 dex .",
    "none of them exhibit a significant @xmath0 value , probably because the effect of the mg lines compared to fe for such rather low peculiarities is too small in the 5200 region .",
    "_ ngc  7099 : _ there are no detailed elemental abundances for members in the literature available . there are three hb stars with a @xmath0 detection , from which one object lies significantly above the hb in the @xmath3 versus @xmath5 diagram . if it is a member then this is probably a very interesting object for follow - up observations . the reasons why several fainter stars deviate from the normality line ( as also seen for ngc  104 ) , are not straightforward to determine without any additional observations .",
    "however , from our previous considerations one can think of non - members or very strong peculiarities of magnesium .",
    "we presented , for the first time , photometric @xmath0 observations of three globular clusters .",
    "it measures the flux distribution in the region from 4900 to 5600 @xcite .",
    "this three filter narrow band system was originally developed to detect classical cp stars of the upper ms .",
    "later on , it turned out that is also capable to detect underabundant , emission as well as shell type stars .",
    "another mile stone was its extension to field stars and clusters in the large magellanic cloud . even in this underabundant ( compared to the milky way ) global environment",
    ", we were able to detect cp stars , which were later confirmed spectroscopically @xcite .    in total ,",
    "we present photometry of 2266 stars from 109 individual frames . according to the 3@xmath1 detection limit of each globular cluster",
    ", we find 61 objects with positive and 29 with negative @xmath0 values .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit of about 3% of apparent peculiar objects .    for ngc 6205",
    ", we were able to compare our results with abundance determinations from the literature .",
    "the @xmath0 values of three hb stars , one without chemical peculiarities , listed in @xcite , are in perfect agreement .",
    "the peculiar objects were clearly detected with + 57 and + 60 mmag , whereas the non - peculiar object does not stand out .",
    "in addition , we analysed 10 rgb stars with [ mg / fe ] values from @xmath190.15 to + 0.30 dex , published by @xcite .",
    "none of them exhibit a significant @xmath0 value , which means that the elemental peculiarity of magnesium has to be much larger to be detected .",
    "several future steps have to be still performed .",
    "first of all , further @xmath0 observations of globular clusters and members with known elemental peculiarities are needed to test and establish the system and its results .",
    "the presented apparent peculiar objects should be analysed in detail , using high resolution spectroscopy and corresponding stellar atmospheres .",
    "however , @xmath0 seems to be a very efficient way to preselect such very interesting objects by means of photometry .",
    "as last step , current available stellar atmospheres within the investigated astrophysical parameter space should be used to calculate synthetic colours for a comparison with the observations .",
