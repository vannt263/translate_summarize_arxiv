    "the isw effect ( sachs & wolfe , 1967 ) has emerged as a new and powerful tool to probe our universe on the largest physical scales , testing deviations from general relativity and the existence of dark - energy independent of other classical probes ( e.g , crittenden and turok 1996 ; bean and dore 2004 ; lue et al 2004 ; cooray et al . 2004 ; garriga et al . 2004 ; song et al .",
    "recently , a number of groups have obtained the first detections of the isw effect by cross - correlating low redshift tracers of the large scale structure ( lss ) with the cosmic variance limited cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps obtained by wmap ( e.g , boughn and crittenden 2004 ; nolta et al . 2004 ; fosalba and gaztaaga 2004 ; fosalba et al .",
    "2003 ; scranton et al . 2003",
    "; afshordi et al 2004 , rassat et al 2006 , cabr et al . 2006 ) .",
    "although current detections are only claimed at the 2 - 4 @xmath0 level , all analyses coherently favor a flat model that is consistent with wmap observations ( spergel et al . 2006 ) . moreover , the redshift evolution of the measured signal already provides first constraints on alternative cosmological scenarios ( corasaniti et al . 2005 ; gaztaaga et al .",
    ".    however , sample variance from the primary cmb aniso - tropies limits the ability with which one can detect cmb - lss correlations . for",
    "the observationally favored flat model , even an optimal measurement of the cross - correlation could only achieve a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath1 ( crittenden and turok 1996 ; peiris and spergel 2000 ; afshordi 2004 , see also fig.[fig : s2npred ] below ) .",
    "given the low significance level of isw detections , a good understanding of the systematic and statistical errors is crucial to optimally exploit cmb - lss correlation data that will be collected in future surveys such as planck , des , spt , lsst , etc . , for cosmological purposes ( see e.g. , pogosian et al .",
    "recent work has focused on the impact of known systematics on cross - correlation measurements ( boughn and crittenden 2005 ; afshordi 2004 ) , however no detailed analysis has been carried out to assess how different error estimates compare or what is the accuracy delivered by each of them .",
    "so far , most of the published analyses have implemented one specific error estimator ( primarily in real or configuration space ) without justifying the choice of that particular estimator or quantifying its degree of accuracy .",
    "in particular , most of the groups that first claimed isw detections ( boughn and crittenden 2004 ; nolta et al .",
    "2004 ; fosalba and gaztaaga 2004 ; fosalba et al .",
    "2003 ; scranton et al .",
    "2003 , rassat et a 2006 ) estimated errors from cmb gaussian montecarlo ( mc ) simulations alone . in this approach",
    "statistical errors are obtained from the dispersion of the cross - correlation between the cmb sky realizations with a ( single ) fixed observed map tracing the nearby large - scale structure .",
    "this estimator is expected to be reasonably accurate as long as the cross - correlation signal is weak and the cmb autocorrelation dominates the total variance of the estimator .",
    "we shall call this error estimator mc1 ( see below ) .",
    "fosalba , gaztaaga & castander ( 2003 ) , fosalba & gaztaaga ( 2004 ) , also used jack - knife ( jk ) errors .",
    "they found that the jk errors perform well as compared to the mc1 estimator , but the jk error from the real data seems up to a factor of two smaller ( on sub - degree scales ) than the jk error estimated from simulations .",
    "this discrepancy arise from the fact that the fiducial theoretical model used in the mc1 simulations does not match the best fit to the data ( see conclusions ) .",
    "afshordi et al ( 2004 ) criticize the mc1 and jk estimators and implement a purely theoretical gaussian estimator in harmonic space ( which we shall call th bellow ) .",
    "however , they did not show why their choice of estimator should be more optimal or validate it with simulations .",
    "this criticism to the jk approach has been spread in the literature without any critical assessment .",
    "vielva , martinez - gonzalez & tucci ( 2006 ) also point out the apparent limitations of the jk method and adopted the mc1 simulations instead . however they seem to find that the signal - to - noise of their measurement depends on the statistical method used .",
    "padmanabham etal ( 2005 ) use fisher matrix approach and mc1-type simulations to validate and calibrate their errors .",
    "they also claim that jk errors tend to underestimate errors because of the small number of uncorrelated jk patches on the sky , but they provide no proof of that .",
    "giannantonio et al ( 2006 ) , use errors from mc simulations that follow the method put forward by boughn et al ( 1997 ) . in their work the error estimator is built from pairs of simulation maps ( of the cmb and large - scale structure fields ) including the predicted auto and cross - correlation .",
    "this is the estimator we shall name mc2 below .",
    "they point out that their results are consistent with what is obtained from the simpler mc1 estimator .    in this paper",
    "we develop a systematic approach to compare different error estimators in cross - correlation analyses .",
    "armed with this machinery , we address some of the open questions that have been raised in previous work on the isw effect detection : how accurate are jk errors ?",
    "are error estimators different due to the input theoretical models or the data themselves ? how many montecarlo simulations should one use to get accurate results ?",
    "can we safely neglect the cross - correlation signal in the simulations ? do harmonic and real space methods yield compatible results ? what is the uncertainty associated to the different error estimates ?",
    "the methodology and results presented here should largely apply to other cross - correlation analyses of different sky maps such as galaxy - galaxy or lensing - galaxy studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the montecarlo and the theoretical methods used to compute the errors for the galaxy - temperature cross - correlation signal .",
    "sections 3 & 4 shows a comparison between the normalized covariances and diagonal errors from different estimators .",
    "the impact of the choice of error estimator on cosmological parameters is discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "we consider four methods to estimate errors . the first one is based on montecarlo ( mc ) simulations of the pair of maps we want to correlate .",
    "we consider two variants : mc2 , where pairs are correlated with a given fiducial model and mc1 , where one map in each pair is fixed and no cross - correlation signal is included . the next two methods rely on theoretical estimation .",
    "we will use a popular harmonic space prediction , that we shall call th ( theory in harmonic space ) . we will also introduce a novel error estimator that is an analytic function of the auto and cross - correlation of the fields in real space that we shall call tc ( theory in configuration space ) .",
    "finally , we will estimate jack - knife ( jk ) errors which uses sub - regions of the actual data map to calculate the dispersion in our estimator .",
    "once we have errors estimated in one space , it is also possible to translate them , through legendre transformation , into the complementary space .",
    "we shall make a clear distinction between the method for the error calculation ( i.e. , mc , th , tc or jk ) , and the estimator onto which the errors are propagated : i.e. either @xmath2 or @xmath3 . for example",
    ", @xmath4 means errors in @xmath2 propagated from theoretical errors originally computed in harmonic space .",
    "this notation is summarized in table [ notation ] .",
    "when the intersection does not exist @xmath5 .",
    "this is the case if @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the radius of the spherical circumference that circumscribes the triangle @xmath8 .",
    "it can be shown can be deduced by relating the spherical and the euclidean triangle with the same points for the vertex .",
    "the radius of a circumscribed circumference is well known for an euclidean case . ] that ,      where @xmath10 when @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the intersection area , @xmath13 , exist , and to compute it we can make use of the figures in [ fig : fprob3p ] as well as spherical trigonometry formulae . the intersection area @xmath13 is delimited by three arcs of a circle of radius @xmath14 .",
    "three points mark the intersection of those arcs in the limiting region .",
    "one can contruct an spherical triangle @xmath15 having those points as vertex .",
    "this is the blue triangle in figure [ fig : fprob3p ] , which shows all necessary angles for this section .",
    "figure [ fig : fprob3p ] also shows how one can get the area @xmath13 from the triangles an sectors of circles . following this figure",
    "the area is    @xmath16 - [ b'+b'+b-\\pi ] + [ a ( 1- \\cos(r ) ) ] - [ a'+a'+a-\\pi ]    \\\\",
    "\\nonumber    & + & [ c ( 1- \\cos(r ) ) ] - [ c'+c'+c-\\pi ]   + [ \\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma-\\pi ]            \\\\",

    "the angles left can be obtained by the spherical cosinus law .",
    "we write only three angles here , but the others can be computed in a similar way .      when @xmath11 but @xmath18 the intersection of the three circles exist but we can not contruct such a triangle as in [ fig : fprob3p ] .",
