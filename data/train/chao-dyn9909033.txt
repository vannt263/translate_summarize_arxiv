    "the intermittent small - scale dynamics of fully developed turbulence at very large reynolds numbers is believed to be more or less scale - invariant within the so - called inertial range , the latter being bound by the integral length scale @xmath0 and the dissipation length scale @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite efforts largely concentrate on scaling exponents , which are deduced from structure functions of the velocity field .",
    "however , `` scaling exponents are not everything '' as they represent for sure the simplest , but at the same time also the most insensitive observables characterising multi - scale processes .",
    "because of this insensitiveness any heroic effort to derive the observed multi - scaling directly from the navier - stokes equation @xcite remains somewhat incomplete as some physics might have been lost with the applied approximations and assumptions .",
    "also , due to the finiteness of the real - world inertial range and the limited statistical sampling , the experimental procedure to extract multi - scaling is not unequivocal and quoted values for scaling exponents beyond sixth order should not be overemphasised . for these reasons and also in view of the quest for universality in the up - to - now unreachable limit @xmath2 , additional observables other than scaling exponents are needed .    in order to explain this philosophy , `` scaling exponents are not everything '' , in more detail",
    ", we discuss heuristic multiplicative cascade processes and show that with a clever subclass of additional observables more can be learned about the intrinsic cascade dynamics than only from scaling exponents . following richardsons historic metaphor of large eddies decaying into successively smaller and smaller eddies ,",
    "a multiplicative cascade process phenomenologically describes the turbulent redistribution of energy flux from large to small scales and is able to reproduce the observed scaling exponents of the surrogate energy dissipation field @xcite , which are related to those of the velocity structure functions by the refined similarity hypothesis @xcite .",
    "originally intended to directly access the multiplicative weight distribution associated to the energy cascade generator distributions of so - called multipliers or break - up coefficients @xcite have been extracted from very large taylor - scale based reynolds number atmospheric boundary layer and wind tunnel flows recently @xcite ; see also ref .",
    "it was found that within the upper part @xmath3 of the inertial range these multiplier distributions do in fact become scale - independent .",
    "however , they do depend on the relative position of parent and daughter domain ; this non - homogeneity of the breakup leaves a subsequent extraction of scaling exponents inconsistent @xcite and indicates the presence of correlations between successive multipliers , as has been confirmed by studying multiplier distributions conditioned on the value of the ( scale- ) previous multiplier @xcite .",
    "the observed correlations appear to be in conflict with the simple multiplicative cascade models , where the cascade generator is assumed to be identical and independent at each breakup .",
    "as has been convincingly demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite this apparent conflict can be resolved : introducing non - conservative cascade generators with a positively skewed weight distribution and restoring euclidean homogeneity of the ultrametric cascade models , the multiplier distributions resulting from a discrete binary multiplicative cascade become a scale - independent fix - point due to small - scale resummation and are in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally deduced distributions , including all observed correlation effects .",
    "originally not anticipated , these multiplier distributions represent one of those wanted clever subclasses of additional observables , from which more can be learned about the relevance of cascade processes in turbulence and about the intrinsic cascade dynamics than only from scaling exponents . the experimental analysis",
    "@xcite reveals that unconditional multiplier distributions are observed to be scale - independent within the range @xmath4 . in view of the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite we call this the visible cascade range . since due to small - scale resummation it takes about three binary scale steps for the multiplier distributions to converge to the scale - independent fix - point the lowest part of the true cascade range @xmath5 is not visible .",
    "a further conclusion from this line of reasoning would be that below @xmath6 dissipation dynamics sets in and modifies the scale - independent cascade dynamics .",
    "besides this interpretation about the scope of cascade processes in turbulence , also more details about the intrinsic cascade dynamics can be learned from multiplier distributions @xcite .",
    "not every weight distribution , associated to a binary cascade generator and reproducing observed scaling exponents within experimental error bars , qualifies to yield the correct distributions of multipliers and their correlations .",
    "it has to come with a positive skewness .",
    "weight distributions of log - normal or certain asymmetric binomial type share this property , whereas , for example , a log - poisson weight distribution @xcite does not .",
    "all those conclusions have been drawn from binary discrete multiplicative cascade processes in connection with base - two ( @xmath7 ) multiplier distributions .",
    "multiplier distributions referring to other scale steps have not been looked at . in this respect",
    "it is of interest to find out whether the latter do again reveal a scale - independent fix - point behaviour with additional correlations or whether they are simply artefacts of the binary discrete cascade model implementation .",
    "not only this aspect is of relevance to find answers , the impact of cascade model implementations with scale steps other than @xmath8 , i.e.  @xmath9 or @xmath10 , has to be studied for the multiplier phenomenology : do multiplier distributions resulting from different model implementations differ or not ? put in other words : are different cascade model implementations distinguishable or indistinguishable on the level of multiplier observables ?",
    " theoretically the scale step @xmath11 associated to the cascade generator is not fixed . due to the present lack of a derivation of cascade models from the navier - stokes equation ,",
    "no specific choice is favoured for @xmath11 , except for personal taste .",
    "only if the last question can be answered with yes , we can consider multiplier distributions as a clever subclass of additional observables .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we sketch the implementation of general multiplicative cascade processes and briefly summarize previous work on ( @xmath12)-multiplier distributions resulting from a discrete ( @xmath8 ) model implementation .",
    "iii concentrates on discrete ( @xmath13 ) implementations of multiplicative cascade processes and presents multiplier distributions referring to scale steps @xmath14 .",
    "a quasicontinuous implementation of random multiplicative cascade models is used in sect .",
    "iv to study respective multiplier distributions referring to various scale steps .",
    "so - called log - stable weight distributions @xcite are considered in sect .",
    "v and , although leading to correct scaling exponents @xcite , shown not to reproduce the observed multiplier distributions .",
    "several conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "vi , the most important being that it does not matter how multiplicative cascade models are implemented ( discrete or continuous ) , since the multiplier observables are indistinguishable .",
    "the following one - dimensional implementation of multiplicative cascade processes is designed to model the energy cascade from large ( @xmath0 ) to small ( @xmath6 ) length scales :    the initial energy flux density field at the integral scale @xmath0 is set equal to @xmath15 without any loss of generality . for an intermediate length scale @xmath16 we introduce a so - called weight field @xmath17 where the index function @xmath18 represents a subdomain of length @xmath19 .",
    "each random weight @xmath20 is independently drawn from a scale - independent probability distribution @xmath21 with mean @xmath22 . the energy density field @xmath23 at the smallest scale @xmath6",
    "is then constructed as a multiplication of weight fields belonging to a hierarchy of different intermediate length scales @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "let us discuss the special case for @xmath26 , so that it is sufficient to consider the fields only in the domain @xmath27 .",
    "the implementation ( [ two3 ] ) can then be understood in terms of a binary cascade generator : the energy density @xmath28 of a domain of length @xmath19 is redistributed onto a left and right subdomain of length @xmath29 with energy densities @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the random weights are drawn from the splitting function @xmath32 the successive application of this cascade generator from the large scale @xmath0 down to the small scale @xmath6 leads to the field ( [ two3 ] ) .",
    " the splitting function ( [ two4 ] ) is not in its most general form as it does not need to factorise .",
    "however , it has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , that because fully developed turbulence is a @xmath33 dimensional process , the observational reduction of a more - dimensional multiplicative cascade process to one dimension leads to a splitting function which factorises almost completely .",
    "the standard observable of multiplicative cascade processes are scaling exponents representing the intermittency corrections .",
    "they are deduced from a scale - invariant moment analysis of the synergetic field ( [ two3 ] ) ; a naive derivation gives @xmath34 with scaling exponents @xmath35 where the independence of the @xmath36 weights @xmath37 ,  , @xmath38 has been exploited .",
    "this deduction is not in full accordance with the analysis of experimentally measured fields ; those are recorded at the finest resolution scale @xmath39 , then averaged over larger length scales @xmath19 , @xmath40 and are not identical to the model field evolved from scales @xmath0 to @xmath19 @xcite , i.e.@xmath41 the scale dependence of moments @xmath42 of the backward field are different from ( [ two5 ] ) and do not show rigorous scaling at the very small scales @xcite . only in the large - scale asymptotic",
    "scaling exponents can be extracted unambiguously and coincide with the expression ( [ two6 ] ) .    originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied in refs.@xcite the method of random multipliers ( or break - up coefficients ) aims at directly accessing scaling exponents via respective distributions of the former . in its most general form multipliers",
    "are defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the averaged energy density over an offspring interval of length @xmath45 and with its centre shifted by @xmath46 with respect to the parent interval .",
    "we distinguish three special cases for the shift parameter @xmath47 : for @xmath48 , @xmath49 we call @xmath50 centred , right- and left - sided , respectively .",
    " for very large reynolds number turbulent flows it has been found experimentally @xcite that the unconditional multiplier distributions @xmath51 , which are sampled over @xmath52 , do not depend on the scale @xmath19 within the regime @xmath53 .",
    "however , a dependence on the shift parameter @xmath47 was noticed ; this `` nonhomogeneity of the breakup '' obscures the relationship between multiplier and weight distribution and the once intended extraction of scaling exponents @xcite .",
    "actually the @xmath47-dependence hints to the existence of correlations between successive multipliers .",
    "these correlations have been observed in conditional multiplier distributions @xmath54 with left / right - sided ( @xmath55 ) @xcite and centred ( @xmath48 ) @xcite shift parameter , respectively , and with the emphasis on base - two ( @xmath7 ) scale steps .",
    "these latest findings appear to contradict the simple multiplicative cascade processes with independent breakups . however , this statement is not true !",
    "the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite with nonconservative binary ( @xmath26 ) random multiplicative cascade models have given a new interpretation to multiplier distributions : unconditional multiplier distributions represent a scale - independent fix - point due to small - scale resummation ; the `` nonhomogeneity of the breakup '' is also naturally explained along this line .",
    "once the sampling of multipliers is allowed over all and not only dyadic positions the correct multiplier correlations have been obtained from positively skewed weight distributions ; for example , a log - normal weight distribution does qualify whereas a log - poisson distribution does not qualify .",
    "these results show that multiplier distributions do reveal more information about the underlying weight distribution than might be extracted from approximate scaling exponents .",
    "for discrete multiplicative cascade models with binary splittings the scale step entering into the construction of the energy density field ( [ two3 ] ) is set equal to @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , we choose @xmath56 .",
    "the length of the field configuration is set equal to @xmath57 , mimicking a long time series . as weight distribution",
    "we choose the binomial distribution @xmath58 with parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; this choice has the correct skewness @xmath61 in order to reproduce conditional base - two multiplier distributions @xcite .",
    "other , non - binomial weight distributions , such as of log - normal or pearson - iii type , are also able to provide a positive skewness and lead to more or less identical base - two multiplier distributions @xcite , all being in qualitative accordance with experimental findings @xcite . also multiplier distributions different from base - two do not distinguish the aforementioned weight distributions .",
    "hence , we will only show results for the weight distribution ( [ three1 ] ) .",
    "due to small - scale resummation @xcite the base - two multiplier distributions are scale - invariant in the regime @xmath62 ; for @xmath63 the distributions converge to the scale - independent fix - point and for scales very close to the integral length scale deviations from scale - invariance set in because of the finiteness of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 1(a2 ) shows simulation results for left - sided multiplier distributions ( @xmath64 ) at scale @xmath65 : the unconditional multiplier distribution @xmath66 comes close to a beta - distribution parametrisation @xmath67 with @xmath68 , which has been extracted from very large reynolds number atmospheric boundary layer turbulence @xcite .",
    "once conditioned on the respective parent multiplier , correlations are observed : the distribution @xmath69 with a large parent multiplier becomes broader than the unconditional distribution and its average is shifted to a value larger than @xmath70 .",
    "the opposite holds for the conditional distribution @xmath71 with a small parent multiplier ; it is more narrow than the unconditional distribution and its average is shifted to a value smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "the positive correlation between left - sided daughter and left - sided parent multiplier is a consequence of the homogeneous sampling of multipliers over all @xmath52-positions , which is not restricted to dyadic cascade positions .",
    "respective multiplier distributions of right / right combinations are identical to these left / left combinations . a negative correlation between daughter and parent multipliers",
    "is revealed for identical left / right and right / left combinations ; their respective distributions are mirror images of those for left / left and right / right combinations , i.e.   @xmath72 .",
    "this explains that conditional distributions , which are averaged over all four daughter / parent combinations , are again symmetric around @xmath73 ; these distributions have been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "left - sided multiplier distributions for scale steps different from @xmath7 are shown in figs .",
    "1(a1+a3 ) .",
    "for @xmath74 the unconditional multiplier distribution converges to a fix - point for @xmath75 ; its maximum is shifted towards smaller values since its average amounts to @xmath76 .",
    "a conditioning on a left - sided parent multiplier again reveals correlations between successive multipliers : the distribution @xmath77 is broader than the unconditional one , whereas @xmath78 is more narrow .",
    " also multiplier distributions of base step close to one , e.g.   @xmath79 , show fix - point behaviour in the regime @xmath75 . in view of the discrete ( @xmath26)-steps used in the cascade evolution",
    "this result appears unexpected on first sight , but again it is small - scale resummation , which explains this result on second thought .",
    "the unconditional left - sided distribution comes with an average of @xmath80 close to one .",
    "the respective conditional distributions @xmath81 and @xmath82 both deviate from the unconditional distribution , but contrary to the @xmath12 and @xmath83 cases , the former has now become broader whereas the latter turns out to be more narrow .",
    "closer inspection reveals that this tendency has been reversed at around @xmath84 .",
    "centred multiplier distributions for scale steps @xmath74 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 do qualitatively show the same behaviour as the respective left - sided multiplier distributions depicted in figs .",
    "1(a1)-(a3 ) .",
    "all centred distributions are more narrow than their respective left - sided counterparts , reflecting again the `` nonhomogeneity of the breakup '' .",
    "this is also illuminated in fig .  2 , where the @xmath87-dependence of the two exponents @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the beta - distribution ( [ three2 ] ) , fitted to the respective unconditional left - sided and centred multiplier distributions , are shown . since",
    "according to ( [ three2 ] ) we have @xmath90 , the two exponents are related by setting @xmath91 .",
    "conditional multiplier distributions of base step different from @xmath12 have not been looked at in refs .",
    "hence , we consider our respective simulation results as predictions .      most often discrete multiplicative cascade models are chosen with scale steps @xmath26 .",
    "now we will consider @xmath92 and @xmath93 and investigate the resulting multiplier distributions . within the implementation ( [ two1])-([two3 ] )",
    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "again for demonstration , the binomial weight distribution ( [ three1 ] ) is picked with new parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 for @xmath92 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 for @xmath93 . according to the expression ( [ two6 ] ) the two parameter settings yield an acceptable intermittency exponent @xmath100 , but",
    "actually have been fitted to reproduce the experimentally deduced unconditional left - sided base - two ( @xmath7 ) multiplier distribution ( [ three2 ] ) with @xmath68 in the fix - point scale regime @xmath101 . for both cases",
    "the resulting unconditional and conditional left - sided fix - point multiplier distributions of bases @xmath74 , @xmath7 and @xmath102 are almost indistinguishable from the respective distributions shown in figs .",
    "1(a1)-(a3 ) for the binary discrete multiplicative cascade implementation with @xmath26 .",
    "the same holds for centred multiplier distributions .    for parameter choices",
    "@xmath103 , @xmath104 , resulting in a negative skewness of the binomial weight distribution , the shape of the resulting unconditional left - sided fix - point multiplier distribution turns out to deviate from the symmetric beta - distribution parametrisation to some small , but noticeable extend .",
    "moreover , the correct effects observed in the conditional multiplier distributions can not be reproduced .",
    " on the contrary , well adjusted log - normal weight distributions come again with the correct positive skewness and almost identically reproduce all unconditional and conditional multiplier distributions derived from the good binomial weight parametrisations .",
    "a discrete implementation of random multiplicative cascade processes is often opposed by the question `` why discrete ? '' .",
    "it is true that a continuous implementation leads to nicer mathematics in terms of log - infinite divisible and log - stable distributions @xcite , but since the relationship of the random multiplicative cascade processes to the navier - stokes equation is unclear for the moment we prefer to consider discrete and continuous versions on an equal footing .",
    " as far as the numerical implementation is concerned a continuous random multiplicative cascade process will always be quasi - continuous .",
    "hence , eqs .",
    "( [ two1])-([two3 ] ) do apply with a quasi - continuous scale step @xmath11 close to one ; we choose @xmath105 , which compared to a binary cascade corresponds to an eightfold scale - densification .",
    "other parameters are set equal to @xmath106 and @xmath95 .",
    "due to scale - densification the binomial weight distribution ( [ three1 ] ) now comes with rescaled parameters .",
    "the setting @xmath107 , @xmath108 comes from a fit of the resulting unconditional left - sided base - two multiplier distribution to the expression ( [ three2 ] ) with @xmath68 ; see fig .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ two6 ] ) it also yields an intermittency exponent of @xmath109 .",
    "because of small - scale resummation all multiplier distributions become again scale - independent fix - points in the range @xmath110 ; to be more concrete , the simulations reveal a lower bound of approximately @xmath111 .",
    "the unconditional left - sided multiplier distributions of base - scale @xmath74 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which are shown in figs .",
    "1(b1)-(b3 ) , are hard to distinguish from those obtained from a scale - discrete cascade implementation , which are illustrated in figs .",
    ". a similar statement can be made not only about the respective left - sided conditional distributions , but also for all unconditional and conditional centred multiplier distributions .",
    "this finding demonstrates that multiplier distributions in the fix - point regime do not distinguish discrete and continuous versions of random multiplicative cascade processes ; again , the reason for this is small - scale resummation .",
    "other suitable parameter settings of the binomial weight distribution quite easily reproduce all unconditional multiplier distributions shown so far .",
    "even with a different - signed skewness , as for example with @xmath112 , @xmath113 , the correlation effects observed in the resulting conditional multiplier distributions go in the right direction , but are reduced by a factor of about @xmath85 in magnitude . ",
    "another interesting parameter setting is @xmath114 , @xmath115 . in the limit @xmath116 with @xmath117",
    "the weight distribution comes with a large negative skewness @xmath118 and leads to the infinite divisible log - poisson cascade model of refs .",
    "all unconditional multiplier distributions shown so far are again reproduced , but only very weak correlation effects are observed in the resulting conditional multiplier distributions .",
    "this demonstrates that although the log - poisson cascade model is capable to reproduce scaling exponents with no doubt , it fails to describe the correlation systematics of multiplier distributions .",
    "these findings suggest that in order to reproduce unconditional as well as correct conditional multiplier distributions the weight distribution has to possess a positive skewness , irrespective of the chosen scale - step-@xmath11 implementation of the underlying multiplicative cascade process . for the binomial weight distribution ( [ three1 ] )",
    "we note that for the qualitatively best parameter choices , i.e.   ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 ) @xmath119 ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) , ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) , ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) , ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) for @xmath128 , @xmath85 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , respectively , the resulting skewness almost coincides at a value around @xmath131 . here a more quantitative analysis , driven by very large reynolds number data , would certainly deserve future consideration .",
    " multiplier distributions resulting from a meticulously tuned log - normal weight distribution @xmath132 are also practically indistinguishable from the results shown in fig .  1 .",
    "qualitative best parameters for the implementations with @xmath128 , @xmath85 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 are @xmath133 , @xmath126 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , respectively , reflecting an approximate , but obvious log - normal dependence @xmath136 .",
    "contrary to the case of the binomial weight distribution , the skewness of the respective log - normal distributions is not identical ; it increases with increasing @xmath11 and stays positive for all four cases .",
    "the multiplier statistics of continuously implemented multiplicative cascade processes appears to be indistinguishable from their discrete counterparts .",
    "this poses the question to what degree a continuous multiplicative cascade process might be described by an effective discrete multiplicative cascade process .",
    "for the translation of a continuous into a discrete multiplicative cascade process it is important to deal with the forward field . in analogy",
    "( [ two3 ] ) the energy density field is evolved from integral down to the intermediate binary target length scales @xmath19 and @xmath29 , respectively , i.e.@xmath137 with @xmath138 , @xmath139 and the scale - densification @xmath140 .",
    "we restrict the @xmath52-regime to @xmath141 .",

    "again an eightfold scale - densification ( @xmath147 ) has been chosen together with the binomial weight distribution ( [ three1 ] ) with parameters @xmath148 , @xmath149 . the effective binary splitting function @xmath146 with effective weights ( [ fourb3 ] )",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "3a for an intermediate length scale .",

    "observe in fig .",
    "3b that the projected weight distribution is not simply a @xmath153-fold convolution of the binomial weight distribution ( [ three1 ] ) ; the modification is a result of the multivariate implementation ( [ two1 ] ) of the weight fields .",
    "note also , that the effective splitting function does not strictly factorise ; a small correlation between the two effective weights @xmath154 and @xmath155 exists as the relative entropy @xmath156 turns out to be negative .",
    "so far the continously implemented multiplicative cascade process has been directly translated into a ( @xmath26)-discrete multiplicative cascade process with an effective splitting function @xmath146 . for consistency",
    "we still have to check , whether this effective ( @xmath26)-discrete multiplicative cascade process leads to identical results for the multiplier statistics . the discrete implementation ( [ two1])-([two3 ] ) with @xmath26 and @xmath146 instead of eq .",

    "qualitatively there is no difference to the distributions illustrated in figs .",

    "in this section we want to demonstrate again , that `` scaling exponents is not everything '' . in view of renormalisation",
    "theory so - called log - stable distributions represent mathematically very attractive parametrisations for the weight distribution @xmath21 , leading its way to the denotation `` universal multifractals '' @xcite . in connection with",
    "the energy cascade in fully developed turbulence they have already been discussed in refs.@xcite , where the expression @xmath157 has been derived for the scaling exponents ( [ two6 ] ) . with an intermittency exponent of @xmath158 and a stable index of @xmath159",
    "the experimentally deduced scaling exponents @xcite are reproduced remarkably well .",
    "focusing on multiplier distributions , we will now reveal limitations of log - stable weight distributions .",
    "concentrating first on a discrete implementation of multiplicative cascade processes , where according to ( [ two1])-([two3 ] ) the parameters are set as @xmath26 , @xmath56 and @xmath160 , the associated log - stable weight distribution @xmath21 is constructed by noting that @xmath161 is distributed according to a stable distribution @xcite .",
    "the skewness parameter has to be set equal to @xmath162 and the scale and shift parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 are fixed by the scaling exponents @xmath165 and @xmath158 . for various stable parameters @xmath166 the respective log - stable weight distributions are illustrated in fig.4a .",
    "depending on @xmath167 these distributions possess different asymmetries with respect to the average @xmath168 ; in fact the skewness @xmath169 , which should neither be confused with the skewness parameter @xmath170 nor with the notation @xmath171 of the stable distributions , amounts to @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 for @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 . if a correct skewness is really a good criterion to reproduce unconditional as well as conditional multiplier distributions , then according to what we now know from the previous sections it should be around @xmath180 for @xmath26 .",
    "this would limit the stable index @xmath167 to a regime close to @xmath85 .",
    "the unconditional left - sided base - two multiplier distributions resulting from the log - stable weight distributions with a given index @xmath167 are again scale - independent in the scale range @xmath62 and are illustrated in fig .",
    "since the log - stable weight distributions have already been fitted to the scaling exponent @xmath181 , there is no further free parameter left to adjust to the observed unconditional left - sided multiplier distribution ( [ three2 ] ) with @xmath68 . for @xmath182",
    "the agreement is acceptable .",
    "notice especially the extra contributions at @xmath183 and @xmath184 for small values of @xmath167 .",
    "this is a consequence of the algebraic tails of the stable - distributions , which lead to excess contributions at @xmath185 in the corresponding weight distributions ; consult again fig .",
    "the conditional multiplier distributions @xmath186 are also shown in fig .  4b , where over all four possible left / right - sided daughter / parent multiplier combinations has been averaged .",
    "for @xmath187 a conditioning on a small parent multiplier , i.e.   @xmath188 , leads to a distribution more narrow than the unconditional distribution and a conditioning on a large parent multiplier , i.e.   @xmath189 , leads to a broader distribution .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings of ref.@xcite . for @xmath190",
    "this tendency has almost vanished , for @xmath191 it has vanished and for @xmath192 it has even been reversed . a very similar behaviour is observed in the conditional centred base - two multiplier distributions , which are depicted in fig .",
    "4c ; only for @xmath167 very close to 2 they are in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings of ref .",
    "this outcome also confirms our conjecture from above that a correct positive skewness is needed for the weight distribution in order to reproduce the multiplier distributions .",
    "a quasi - continuous implementation of multiplicative cascade processes with log - stable weight distributions leads to multiplier distributions , which are identical to those shown in figs .",
    "4b+c for the discrete implementation .",
    "hence , we arrive at the conclusion that although scaling exponents are well fitted by log - stable weight distributions with index @xmath193 @xcite the observed systematics of the multiplier distributions rules out such a stable index value . the log - normal limit @xmath194 reproduces the multiplier distributions much better .",
    "discrete and continuous implementations of geometric multiplicative cascade processes are both able to model multifractal characteristics observed in the surrogate energy dissipation field of fully developed turbulence . since their relation to the navier - stokes equation remains unclear neither form of implementation is principally favoured over the other .",
    "although perhaps somewhat unexpected , this indistinguishability remains once a specific class of observables , going beyond scaling exponents , is employed : multiplier distributions referring to various scale - steps , discrete or quasi - continuous , do not care whether they result from discrete or continuous versions of nonconservative multiplicative cascade processes .",
    "the reason for this is that the multivariate model implementation implies a small - scale resummation leading to scale - independent fix - point distributions . from an analysis point of view",
    "a discrete or continuous multiplicative cascade process with no correlations between the various branchings appears as a continuous multiplicative cascade process with correlations .",
    "there is more to learn from these fix - point multiplier distributions : not every weight distribution associated to the cascade generator , which matches scaling exponents within experimental error bars , qualifies to reproduce the observed multiplier correlations .",
    "the weight distribution has to possess a positive skewness .",
    "for example , so - called log - stable distributions with a stable index not close to @xmath187 do not share this property and are unable to reproduce the observed conditional multiplier distributions .",
    " this leaves us with a speculation : the original idea to directly access scaling exponents via unconditional multiplier distributions does not work due to the observed correlations between multipliers .",
    "however , these correlations help to restrict the broad class of cascade weight distributions , which all reproduce the observed lowest - order scaling exponents , to those having a positive skewness . a further restriction of this subclass appears to be possible with yet additional observables to be derived from the full analytic solution of the multivariate cascade characteristic function @xcite .",
    "then , by directly accessing the cascade weight distribution , it is tempting to study its dependence on the reynolds number and on the flow configuration , and , thus , to check for universality ."
