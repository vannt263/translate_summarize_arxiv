    "in parts i[1 ] and ii[2 ] , the basic facts concerning zero - divisors ( zds ) as they arise in the hypercomplex context were presented and proved . `` basic , '' in the context of this monograph , means seven things .",
    "first , they emerged as a side - effect of applying cdp a minimum of 4 times to the real number line , doubling dimension to the complex plane , quaternion 4-space , octonion 8-space , and 16-d sedenions . with each such doubling ,",
    "new properties were found : as the price of sacrificing counting order , the imaginaries made a general theory of equations and solution - spaces possible ; the non - commutative nature of quaternions mapped onto the realities of the manner in which forces deploy in the real world , and led to vector calculus ; the non - associative nature of octonions , meanwhile , has only come into its own with the need for necessarily unobservable quantities ( because of conformal field - theoretical constraints)in string theory . in the sedenions , however , the most basic assumptions of all  well - defined notions of field and algebraic norm ( and , therefore , measurement )  break down , as the phenomena correlated with their absence , zero - divisors , appear onstage ( never to leave it for all higher cdp dimension - doublings ) .",
    "second thing : zds require at least two differently - indexed imaginary units to be defined , the index being an integer larger than 0 ( the cdp index of the real unit ) and less than @xmath5 for a given cdp - generated collection of @xmath5-ions . in `` pure cdp , '' the enormous number of alternative labeling schemes possible in any given @xmath5-ion level are drastically reduced by assuming that units with such indices interact by xor - ing : the index of the product of any two is the xor of their indices .",
    "signing is more tricky ; but , when cdp is reduced to a 2-rule construction kit , it becomes easy : for index @xmath6 , @xmath7 the generator of the @xmath5-ions ( i.e. , the power of 2 immediately larger than the highest index of the predecessor @xmath8-ions ) , rule 1 says @xmath9 .",
    "rule 2 says take an associative triplet @xmath10 , assumed written in cpo ( short for `` cyclically positive order '' : to wit , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) .",
    "consider , for instance , any @xmath14 index set .",
    "then three more such associative triplets ( henceforth , _ trips _ ) can be generated by adding * g * to two of the three , then switching their resultants places in the cpo scheme .",
    "hence , starting with the quaternions @xmath15 ( which we ll call a _ rule 0 _ trip , as it s inherited from a prior level of cdp induction ) , rule 1 gives us the trips @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , while rule 2 yields up the other 4 trips defining the octonions : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "any zd in a given level of @xmath5-ions will then have units with one index @xmath22 , written in lowercase , and the other index @xmath23 , written in uppercase .",
    "such pairs , alternately called `` dyads '' or `` assessors , '' saturate the diagonal lines of their planes , which diagonals never mutually zero - divide each other ( or make _ dmzs _",
    ", for `` divisors ( or dyads ) making zero '' ) , but only make dmzs with other such diagonals , in other such assessors .",
    "( this is , of course , the opposite situation from the projection operators of quantum mechanics , which are diagonals in the planes formed by reals and dimensions spanned by pauli spin operators contained within the 4-space created by the cartesian product of two standard imaginaries . )",
    "third thing : such zds are not the only possible in cdp spaces ; but they define the `` primitive '' variety from which zd spaces saturating more than 1-d regions can be articulated .",
    "a not quite complete catalog of these can be found in our first monograph on the theme [ 3 ] ; a critical kind which was overlooked there , involving the reals ( and hence , providing the backdrop from which to see the projection - operator kind as a degenerate type ) , were first discussed more recently [ 4 ] .",
    "( ironically , these latter are the easiest sorts of composites to derive of any : place the two diagonals of a dmz pairing with differing internal signing on axes of the same plane , and consider the diagonals _ they _ make with each other ! )",
    "all the primitive zds in the sedenions can be collected on the vertices of one of 7 copies of an octahedron in the _ box - kite _ representation , each of whose 12 edges indicates a two - way `` dmz pathway , '' evenly divided between 2 varieties . for any vertex v , and @xmath24 any real scalar , indicate the diagonals this way : @xmath25 , while @xmath26 .",
    "6 edges on a box - kite will always have _ negative edge - sign _ ( with _ unmarked _ et cell entries : see the `` sixth thing '' ) . for vertices m and",
    "n , exactly two dmzs run along the edge joining them , written thus :    @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31    the other 6 all have _ positive edge - sign _ , the diagonals of their two dmzs having same slope ( and _ marked _  with leading dashes  et cell entries ) :    @xmath32 @xmath33    fourth thing : the edges always cluster similarly , with two opposite faces among the 8 triangles on the box - kite being spanned by 3 negative edges ( conventionally painted red in color renderings ) , with all other edges being positive ( painted blue ) .",
    "one of the red triangles has its vertices 3 low - index units forming a trip ; writing their vertex labels conventionally as a , b , c , we find there are in fact always 4 such trips cycling among them : @xmath10 , the _",
    "l - trip _ ; and the three _ u - trips _ obtained by replacing all but one of the lowercase labels in the l - trip with uppercase : @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 .",
    "such a 4-trip structure is called a _ sail _ , and",
    "a box - kite has 4 of them : the _ zigzag _ , with all negative edges , and the 3 _ trefoils _ , each containing two positive edges extending from one of the zigzag vertices to the two vertices opposite its _",
    "sailing partners_. these opposite vertices are always joined by one of the 3 negative edges comprising the vent which is the zigzag s opposite face .",
    "again by convention , the vertices opposite a , b , c are written f , e , d in that order ; hence , the trefoil sails are written @xmath37 ; @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , ordered so that their lowercase renderings are equivalent to their cpo l - trips .",
    "the graphical convention is to show the sails as filled in , while the other 4 faces , like the vent , are left empty : they show `` where the wind blows '' that keeps the box - kite aloft .",
    "a real - world box - kite , meanwhile , would be held together by 3 dowels ( of wood or plastic , say ) spanning the joins between the only vertices left unconnected in our octahedral rendering : the _ struts _ linking the _ strut - opposite _ vertices ( a , f ) ; ( b , e ) ; ( c , d ) .    fifth thing : in the sedenions , the 7 isomorphic box - kites are differentiated by which octonion index is missing from the vertices , and this index is designated by the letter * s * , for `` signature , '' `` suppressed index , '' or _",
    "strut constant_. this last designation derives from the invariant relationship obtaining in a given box - kite between * s * and the indices in the vent and zigzag termini ( v and z respectively ) of any of the 3 struts , which we call the `` first vizier '' or vz1 .",
    "this is one of 3 rules , involving the three sedenion indices always missing from a box - kite s vertices : @xmath7 , @xmath40 , and their simple sum @xmath41 ( which is also their xor product , since @xmath7 is always to the left of the left - most bit in @xmath40 ) . the second vizier tells us that the l - index of either terminus with the u - index of the other always form a trip with @xmath7 , and it true as written for all @xmath5-ions .",
    "the third shows the relationship between the l- and u- indices of a given assessor , which always form a trip with @xmath41 . like the first , it is true as written only in the sedenions , but as an unsigned statement about indices only",
    ", it is true universally .",
    "( for that reason , references to vz1 and vz3 hereinout will be assumed to refer to the _ unsigned _ versions . )",
    "first derived in the last section of part i , reprised in the intro of part ii , we write them out now for the third and final time in this monograph :    vz1 : @xmath42    vz2 : @xmath43    vz3 : @xmath44",
    ".    rules 1 and 2 , the three viziers , plus the standard octonion labeling scheme derived from the simplest finite projective group , usually written as psl(2,7 ) , provide the basis of our toolkit .",
    "this last becomes powerful due to its capacity for recursive re - use at all levels of cdp generation , not just the octonions .",
    "the simplest way to see this comes from placing the unique rule 0 trip provided by the quaternions on the circle joining the 3 sides midpoints , with the octonion generator s index , 4 , being placed in the center .",
    "then the 3 lines leading from the rule 0 trip s ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) midpoints to their opposite angles  placed conventionally in clockwise order in the midpoints of the left , right , and bottom sides of a triangle whose apex is at 12 oclock  are cpo trips forming the struts , while the 3 sides themselves are the rule 2 trips .",
    "these 3 form the l - index sets of the trefoil sails , while the rule 0 trip provides the same service for the zigzag . by a process analogized to tugging on a slipcover ( part i ) and pushing things into the central zone of hot oil while wok - cooking ( part ii ) , all 7 possible values of * s * in the sedenions , not just the 4 , can be moved into the center while keeping orientations along all 7 lines of the triangle unchanged .",
    "part ii s critical roundabout theorem tells us , moreover , that all @xmath5-ion zds , for all @xmath45 , are contained in box - kites as their minimal ensemble size .",
    "hence , by placing the appropriate @xmath7 , @xmath40 , or @xmath41 in the center of a psl(2,7 ) triangle , with a suitable rule 0 trip s indices populating the circle , any and all _ candidate _ primitive zds can be discovered and situated .",
    "sixth thing : the word `` candidate '' in the above is critical ; its exploration was the focus of part ii . for , starting with @xmath46 and hence @xmath47 ( which is to say , in the 32-d pathions ) , whole box - kites can be suppressed ( meaning , all 12 edges , and not just the struts , no longer serve as dmz pathways ) .",
    "but for all @xmath0 , the full set of candidate box - kites are viable when @xmath48 or equal to some higher power of 2 . for all other @xmath40 values , though , the phenomenon of _ carrybit overflow _ intervenes  leading , ultimately , to the `` meta - fractal '' behavior claimed in our abstract . to see this",
    ", we need another mode of representation , less tied to 3-d visualizing , than the box - kite can provide .",
    "the answer is a matrix - like method of tabulating the products of candidate zds with each other , called _ emanation tables _ or _",
    "ets_. the l - indices only of all candidate zds are all we need indicate ( the u - indices being forced once @xmath7 is specified ) ; these will saturate the list of allowed indices @xmath22 , save for the value of @xmath40 whose choice , along with that of @xmath7 , fixes an et .",
    "hence , the unique et for given @xmath7 and @xmath40 will fill a square spreadsheet whose edge has length @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , a cell entry ( r , c ) is only filled when row and column labels r and c form a dmz , which can never be the case along an et s long diagonals : for the diagonal starting in the upper left corner , r xor r = 0 , and the two diagonals within the same assessor , can never zero - divide each other ; for the righthand diagonal , the convention for ordering the labels ( ascending counting order from the left and top , with any such label s strut - opposite index immediately being entered in the mirror - opposite positions on the right and bottom ) makes r and c strut - opposites , hence also unable to form dmzs .    for the sedenions ,",
    "we get a 6 x 6 table , 12 of whose cells ( those on long diagonals ) are empty : the 24 filled cells , then , correspond to the two - way traffic of `` edge - currents '' one imagines flowing between vertices on a box - kite s 12 edges .",
    "a computational corollary to the roundabout theorem , dubbed the _ trip - count two - step _ , is of seminal importance .",
    "it connects this most basic theorem of ets to the most basic fact of associative triplets , indicated in the opening pages of part i , namely : for any n , the number @xmath50 of associative triplets is found , by simple combinatorics , to be @xmath51  35 for the sedenions , 155 for the pathions , and so on .",
    "but , by trip - count two - step , we also know that _ the maximum number of box - kites that can fill a @xmath5-ion et = @xmath52 .",
    "_ for @xmath40 a power of 2 , beginning in the pathions ( for @xmath53 ) , the number hub theorem says the upper left quadrant of the et is an unsigned multiplication table of the @xmath54-ions in question , with the 0 s of the long diagonal ( indicated real negative units ) replaced by blanks ",
    "a result effectively synonymous with the trip - count two - step .",
    "seventh thing : we found , as part ii s argument wound down , that the 2 classes of ets found in the pathions  the `` normal '' for @xmath55 , filled with indices for all 7 possible box - kites , and the `` sparse '' so - called sand mandalas , showing only 3 box - kites when @xmath56 , were just the beginning of the story .",
    "a simple formula involving just the bit - string of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where the lowercase indicates the values of @xmath40 and @xmath59 modulo @xmath60 , gave the prototype of our first _",
    "recipe _ : all and only cells with labels r or c , or content p ( = r xor c ) , are filled in the et .",
    "the 4 `` missing box - kites '' were those whose l - index trip would have been that of a sail in the @xmath8 realm with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the sequence of 7 ets , viewed in @xmath40-increasing succession , had an obvious visual logic leading to their being dubbed a _",
    "flip - book_. these 7 were obviously indistinguishable from many vantages , hence formed a _",
    "spectrographic band_. there were 3 distinct such bands , though , each typified by a box - kite count common to all band - members , demonstrable in the ets for the 64-d chingons .",
    "each band contained @xmath40 values bracketed by multiples of 8 ( either less than or equal to the higher , depending upon whether the latter was or was nt a power of 2 ) .",
    "these were claimed to underwrite behaviors in all higher @xmath5-ion ets , according to 3 rough patterns in need of algorithmic refining in this part iii .",
    "corresponding to the first unfilled band , with ets always missing @xmath63 of their candidate box - kites for @xmath64 , we spoke of _ recursivity _ , meaning the ets for constant @xmath65 and increasing @xmath0 would all obey the same recipe , properly abstracted from that just cited above , empirically found among the pathions for @xmath66 .",
    "the second and third behaviors , dubbed , for @xmath40 ascending , _ ( s , g)-modularity _ and _ hide / fill involution _ respectively , make their first showings in the chingons , in the bands where @xmath67 , and then where @xmath68 . in all such cases ,",
    "we are concerned with seeing the `` period - doubling '' inherent in cdp and chaotic attractors both become manifest in a repeated doubling of et edge - size , leading to the fixed-@xmath40 , @xmath0 increasing analog of the fixed-@xmath69 increasing flip - books first observed in the pathions , which we call _ balloon - rides_. specifying and proving their workings , and combining all 3 of the above - designated behaviors into the `` fundamental theorem of zero - division algebra , '' will be our goals in this final part iii .",
    "anyone who has read this far is encouraged to bring up the graphical complement to this monograph , the 78-slide powerpoint show presented at nks 2006 [ 5 ] , in another window .",
    "( slides will be referenced by number in what follows . )",
    "we know that any et for the @xmath5-ions is a square whose edge is @xmath71 cells .",
    "how , then , can any simply recursive rule govern exporting the structure of one such box to analogous boxes for progressively higher @xmath0 ?",
    "the answer : _ include the label lines _ ",
    "not just the column and row headers running across the top and left margins , but their strut - opposite values , placed along the bottom and right margins , which are mirror - reversed copies of the label - lines _ ( lls ) _ proper to which they are parallel .",
    "this increases the edge - size of the et box to @xmath8 .",
    "theorem 11 . for any fixed @xmath66 and not a power of @xmath1 ,",
    "the row and column indices comprising the label lines ( lls ) run along the left and top borders of the @xmath5-ion et `` spreadsheet '' for that @xmath40 .",
    "treat them as included in the spreadsheet , _ as labels _",
    ", by adding a row and column to the given square of cells , of edge @xmath71 , which comprises the et proper . then add another row and column to include the strut - opposite values of these labels indices in `` mirror lls , '' running along the opposite edges of a now @xmath8-edge - length box , whose four corner cells , like the long diagonals they extend , are empty .",
    "when , for such a fixed @xmath40 , the et for the @xmath72-ions is produced , the values of the 4 sets of ll indices , bounding the contained @xmath5-ion et , correspond , _ as cell values _ , to actual dmz p - values in the bigger et , residing in the rows and columns labeled by the contained et s @xmath7 and @xmath73 ( the containing et s @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) .",
    "moreover , all cells contained in the box they bound in the containing et have p - values ( else blanks ) exactly corresponding to  and _ including edge - sign markings _ of  the positionally identical cells in the @xmath5-ion et : those , that is , for which the lls act as labels .    _ proof .",
    "_ for all strut constants of interest , @xmath76 ; hence , all labels up to and including that immediately adjoining its own strut constant ( that is , the first half of them ) will have indices monotonically increasing , up to and at least including the midline bound , from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "when @xmath0 is incremented by @xmath77 , the row and column midlines separating adjoining strut - opposites will be cut and pulled apart , making room for the labels for the @xmath72-ion et for same @xmath65 , which middle range of label indices will also monotonically increase , this time from the current @xmath79-ion generation s @xmath74 ( and prior generation s @xmath7 ) , up to and at least including its own midline bound , which will be @xmath74 plus the number of cells in the ll inherited from the prior generation , or @xmath80 .",
    "the lls are therefore contained in the rows and columns headed by @xmath74 and its strut opposite , @xmath75 .",
    "to say that the immediately prior cdp generation s et labels are converted to the current generation s p - values in the just - specified rows and columns is equivalent to asserting the truth of the following calculation :    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83 only if @xmath84    here , we use two binary variables , the inner - sign - setting @xmath85 , and the vent - or - zigzag test , based on the first vizier . using the two in tandem lets us handle the normal and `` type ii '' box - kites in the same proof .",
    "recall ( and see appendix b of part ii for a quick refresher ) that while the `` type i '' is the only type we find in the sedenions , we find that a second variety emerges in the pathions , indistinguishable from type i in most contexts of interest to us here : the orientation of 2 of the 3 struts will be reversed ( which is why vz1 and vz3 are only true generally when unsigned ) . for a type",
    "i , since @xmath86 , we know by rule 1 that we have the trip @xmath87 ; hence , @xmath74  for all @xmath5-ions beyond the pathions , where the sand mandalas @xmath88 is the l - index of the zigzag b assessor  must be a vent ( and its strut - opposite , @xmath75 , a zigzag ) .",
    "for a type ii , however , this is necessarily so only for 1 of the 3 struts  which means , per the equation above , that sg must be reversed to obtain the same result .",
    "said another way , we are free to assume either signing of @xmath89 means + 1 , so the `` only if '' qualifying the zero result is informative .",
    "it is @xmath90 and its relationship to @xmath91 that is of interest here , and this formulation makes it easier to see that the products hold for arbitrary ll indices @xmath90 _ or _ their strut - opposites . but for this , the term - by - term computations should seem routine : the left bottom is the rule 1 outcome of @xmath92 : obviously , any @xmath90 index must be less than @xmath74 . to its right",
    ", we use the trip @xmath93 , whose cpo order is opposite that of the multiplication . for the top",
    "left , we use @xmath94 as limned above , then augment by @xmath74 , then @xmath7 , leaving @xmath95 unaffected in the first augmenting , and @xmath91 in the second .",
    "finally , the top right ( ignoring @xmath85 and @xmath89 momentarily ) is obtained this way : @xmath96 ; ergo , @xmath97 .",
    "note that we can not eke out any information about edge - sign marks from this setup : since labels , as such , have no marks , we have nothing to go on  unlike all other cells which our recursive operations will work on . indeed , the exact algorithmic determination of edge - sign marks for labels is not so trivial : as one iterates through higher @xmath0 values , some segments of ll indexing will display reversals of marks found in the ascending or descending left midline column , while other segments will show them unchanged  with key values at the beginnings and ends of such octaves ( multiples of @xmath98 , and sums of such multiples with @xmath99 ) sometimes being reversed or kept the same irrespective of the behavior of the terms they bound . fortunately ,",
    "such behaviors are of no real concern here  but they are , nevertheless , worth pointing out , given the easy predictability of other edge - sign marks in our recursion operations .",
    "now for the et box within the labels : if all values ( including edge - sign marks ) remain unchanged as we move from the @xmath5-ion et to that for the @xmath72-ions , then one of 3 situations must obtain : the inner - box cells have labels @xmath100 which belong to some zigzag l - trip @xmath101 ; or , on the contrary , they correspond to vent l - indices  the first two terms in the cpo triplet @xmath102 , for instance ; else , finally , one term is a vent , the other a zigzag ( so that inner - signs of their multiplied dyads are both positive ) : we will write them , in cpo order , @xmath103 and @xmath90 , with third trip member @xmath104 . clearly , we want all the products in the containing et to indicate dmzs only if the inner et s cells do similarly .",
    "this is easily arranged : for the containing et s cells have indices identical to those of the contained et s , save for the appending of @xmath74 to both ( and ditto for the u - indices ) .",
    "_ case 1 : _ if @xmath101 form a zigzag l - index set , then so do @xmath105 , so markings remain unchanged ; and if the @xmath106 cell entry is blank in the contained , so will be that for @xmath107 in its container . in other words , the following holds :    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath83 only if @xmath110    @xmath111 @xmath112 ; hence , @xmath113 .",

    "@xmath124 rule 2 twice to the same two terms yields the same result as the terms in the raw , hence @xmath113 .",
    "clearly , cycling through @xmath125 to consider @xmath126 will give the exactly analogous result , forcing two ( hence three ) negative inner - signs in the candidate sail ; hence , if we have dmzs at all , we have a zigzag sail .",
    "_ case 2 : _ the product of two vents must have negative edge - sign , and there s no cycling through same - inner - signed products as with the zigzag , so we ll just write our setup as a one - off , with upper inner - sign explicitly negative , and claim its outcome true",
    ".    @xmath127    @xmath128    @xmath83    @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 ; hence , @xmath132 .",

    "_ case 3 : _ the product of vent and zigzag displays same inner sign in both dyads ; hence the following arithmetic holds :    @xmath145    @xmath146    @xmath83    the calculations are sufficiently similar to the two prior cases as to make their writing out tedious .",
    "it is clear that , in each of our three cases , content and marking of each cell in the contained et and the overlapping portion of the container et are identical .",
    "@xmath147    to highlight the rather magical label / content involution that occurs when @xmath0 is in- or de- cremented , graphical realizations of such nested patterns , as in slides 60 - 61 , paint lls ( and labels proper ) a sky - blue color .",
    "the bottom - most et being overlaid in the central box has @xmath148 the maximum high - bit in @xmath40 , and is dubbed the _ inner skybox_. the degree of nesting is strictly measured by counting the number of bits @xmath149 that a given skybox s @xmath74 is to the left of this strut - constant high - bit .",
    "if we partition the inner skybox into quadrants defined by the midlines , and count the number @xmath150 of quadrant - sized boxes along one or the other long diagonal , it is obvious that the inner skybox itself has @xmath151 and @xmath152 ; the nested skyboxes containing it have @xmath153 . if recursion of skybox nesting be continued indefinitely  to the fractal limit , which terminology we will clarify shortly  the indices contained in filled cells of any skybox can be interpreted in @xmath149 distinct ways , @xmath154 , as representations of distinct zds with differing @xmath7 and , therefore , differing u - indices . by obvious analogy to the theory of riemann surfaces in complex analysis , each such skybox is a separate `` sheet '' ; as with even such simple functions as the logarithmic , the number of such sheets is infinite .",
    "we could then think of the infinite sequence of skyboxes as so many cross - sections , at constant distances , of a flashlight beam whose intensity ( one over the et s cell count ) follows kepler s inverse square law .",
    "alternatively , we could ignore the sheeting and see things another way .    where we called fixed-@xmath0 , @xmath40 varying sequences of ets flip - books , we refer to fixed-@xmath40 , @xmath0 varying sequences as balloon rides : the image is suggested by david niven s role as phineas fogg in the movie made of jules vernes _ around the world in 80 days _ : to ascend higher , david would drop a sandbag over the side of his hot - air balloon s basket ; if coming down , he would pull a cord that released some of the balloon s steam .",
    "each such navigational tactic is easy to envision as a bit - shift , pushing @xmath7 further to the left to cross lls into a higher skybox , else moving it rightward to descend . using @xmath155 as the basis of a 3-stage balloon - ride ,",
    "we see how increasing @xmath0 from @xmath156 to @xmath157 to @xmath158 approaches the white - space complement of one of the simplest ( and least efficient ) plane - filling fractals , the cesro double sweep [ 6 , p. 65",
    "the graphics were programmatically generated prior to the proving of the theorems we re elaborating : their empirical evidence was what informed ( indeed , demanded ) the theoretical apparatus .",
    "and we are not quite finished with the current task the apparatus requires of us .",
    "we need two more theorems to finish the discussion of skybox recursion . for",
    "both , suppose some skybox with @xmath159 , @xmath24 any non - negative integer , is nested in one with @xmath160 .",
    "divide the former along midlines to frame its four quadrants , then block out the latter skybox into a @xmath161 grid of same - sized window panes , partitioned by the one - cell - thick borders of its own midlines into quadrants , each of which is further subdivided by the outside edges of the 4 one - cell - thick label lines and their extensions to the window s frame .",
    "these extended lls are themselves nsls , and have @xmath162 values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; for @xmath163 , they also adjoin nsls along their outer edges whose @xmath162 values are multiples of @xmath98 plus @xmath164 .",

    "the french windows theorem shows us the way the cell contents of the pairs of panes contained between the @xmath160 skybox s corners are generated from those of the analogous pairings of quadrants in the @xmath159 skybox , by adding @xmath74 to l - indices .",

    "if a high - bit be appended to @xmath40 , then the associated box - kites are offed .",
    "however , if _ another _ high - bit be affixed , these dormant box - kites are re - awakened  the second half of _ hide / fill involution_. we simply assume an l - index set @xmath125 underwriting a sail in the et for the pre - augmented @xmath40 , with assessors @xmath333 and @xmath334 .",
    "then , we introduce a more leftified bit @xmath335 , where pre - augmented @xmath336 , then compute the term - by term products of @xmath337 and @xmath338 , using the usual methods . and as these methods tell us that two applications of rule 2 have the same effect as none in such a setup , we have no more to prove .",
    "@xmath220    _",
    "corollary_. the induction just invoked makes it clear that strut constants equal to multiples of @xmath98 not powers of @xmath1 are included in the same spectral band as all other integers larger than the prior multiple . the promissory note issued in the second paragraph of part ii s concluding section , on 64-d spectrography ,",
    "can now be deemed redeemed .    in the chingons , high - bits @xmath339 and @xmath340 are necessarily adjacent in the bitstring for @xmath341 ; but in the general @xmath5-ion case , @xmath0 large , zero - padding guarantees that things will work in just the same manner , with only one difference : the recursive creation of `` harmonics '' of relatively small-@xmath74 @xmath342-modular @xmath343 values will propagate to further levels , thereby effecting overall box - kite counts .    in general terms , we have echoes of the formula given for @xmath342-modular calculations , but with this signal difference : there will be _ one _ such rule for _ each _ high - bit @xmath344 in @xmath40 , where residues of @xmath40 modulo @xmath344 will generate their own near - solid lines of rows and columns , be they hidden or filled . likewise for multiples of @xmath345 which are not covered by prior rules , and multiples of @xmath346 supplemented by the bit - specific residue ( regardless of whether @xmath344 itself is available for treatment by this bit - specific rule ) . in the simplest , no - zero - padding instances ,",
    "all even multiples are excluded , as they will have occurred already in prior rules for higher bits , and fills or hides , once fixed by a higher bit s rule , can not be overridden .",
    "cases with some zero - padding are not so simple .",
    "consider this two - bit instance , @xmath347 : the fill - bit is 64 , the hide - bit is just 8 , so that only 9 and 64 generate nsls of filled values ; all other multiples of 8 , and their supplementing by 1 ( including 65 ) are nsls of hidden values .",
    "now look at a variation on this example , with the single high - bit of zero - padding removed ",
    "i.  e. , @xmath348 . here",
    ", the fill - bit is 32 , and its multiples 64 and 96 , as well as their supplements by @xmath349 , or 9 and 73 and 105 , label nsls of filled values ; but all other multiples of 8 , plus all multiples of 8 supplemented by 1 not equal to 9 or 73 or 105 , label nsls of hidden values .",
    "cases with multiple fill and hide bits , with or without additional zero - padding , are obviously even more complicated to handle explicitly on a case - by - case basis , but the logic framing the rules remain simple ; hence , even such messy cases are programmatically easy to handle .",
    "hide / fill involution means , then , that the first , third , and any further odd - numbered high - bits ( counting from the left ) will generate `` fill '' rules , whereas all the even - numbered high - bits generate `` hide '' rules  with all cells not touched by a rule being either hidden ( if the total number of high - bits @xmath149 is odd ) or filled ( @xmath149 is even ) .",
    "two further examples should make the workings of this protocol more clear .",
    "first , the chingon test case of @xmath305 : for @xmath350 , all the et cells are filled ; however , for @xmath351 , et cells not already filled by the first rule ( and , as visual inspection of slide 48 indicates , there are only 8 cells in the entire 840-cell et already filled by the prior rule which the current rule would like to operate on ) are hidden from view . because the 16- and 8- bits are the only high - bits , the count of same is even , meaning all remaining et cells not covered by these 2 rules are filled .",
    "we get 23 for box - kite count as follows .",
    "first , the 16-bit rule gives us 7 box - kites , per earlier arguments ; the 8-bit rule , which gives 3 filled box - kites in the pathions , recursively propagates to cover 19 hidden box - kites in the chingons , according to the formula produced last section . but",
    "hide / fill involution says that , of the 35 maximum possible box - kites in a chingon et , @xmath352 are now made visible .",
    "as none of these have the pathion @xmath47 as an l - index , and all the 7 box - kites from the 16-bit rule _ do _ , we therefore have a grand total of @xmath353 box - kites in the @xmath354 et , as claimed ( and as cell - counting on the cited slide will corroborate ) .",
    "the concluding slides 7678 present a trio of color - coded `` histological slices '' of the hiding and filling sequence ( beginning with the blanking of the long diagonals ) for the simplest 3-high - bit case , @xmath355 . here",
    ", the first fill rule works on 25 and 32 ; the first hide rule , on 9 , 16 , 41 , and 48 ; the second fill rule , on 1 , 8 , 17 , 24 , 33 , 40 , 49 , and 56 ; and the rest of the cells , since the count of high - bits is odd , are left blank .",
    "we do not give an explicit algorithmic method here , however , for computing the number of box - kites contained in this 3,720-cell et .",
    "such recursiveness is best handled programmatically , rather than by cranking out an explicit ( hence , long and tedious ) formula , meant for working out by a time - consuming hand calculation .",
    "what we can do , instead , is conclude with a brief finale , embodying all our results in the simple `` recipe theory '' promised originally , and offer some reflections on future directions .",
    "all of the prior arguments constitute steps sufficient to demonstrate the fundamental theorem of zero - divisor algebra . like",
    "the role played by its gaussian predecessor in the legitimizing of another `` new kind of [ complex ] number theory , '' its simultaneous simplicity and generality open out on extensive new vistas at once alien and inviting .",

    "proposition : _ any integer @xmath356 not a power of @xmath1 can uniquely be associated with a strut constant @xmath40 of zd ensembles , whose inner skybox resides in the @xmath5-ions with @xmath357 .",
    "the bitstring representation of @xmath40 completely determines an infinite - dimensional analog of a standard plane - confined fractal , with each of the latter s points associated with an empty cell in the infinite emanation table , with all non - empty cells comprised wholly of mutually orthogonal primitive zero - divisors , one line of same per cell .",

    "it is only natural then to re - inscribe the theme of mathematizing semiotics into the current context : petitot offers separate studies , at the `` atomic '' level where greimas `` semiotic square '' resides ; and at the large - scale and architectural , where one must place lvi - strauss s `` canonical law of myths . ''",
    "but the pressing problem is finding a smooth approach that lets one slide the same modeling methodology from the one scale to the other : a fractal - based `` scale - free network '' approach , in other words .",
    "what makes this distinct from the problem we just saw varela consider is the focus on the structure , rather than dynamics , of transient coherence  a focus , then , in the last analysis , on a characterization of _ database architecture _ that can at once accommodate meta - chaotic transiency and structural linguists cascades of `` double articulations . ''",
    "starting at least with c. s. peirce over a century ago , and receiving more recent elaboration in the hands of j. m. dunn and the research into the `` semantic web '' devolving from his work , data structures which include metadata at the same level as the data proper have led to a focus on `` triadic logic , '' as perhaps best exemplified in the recent work of edward l. robertson . [ 13 ] his exploration of a natural triadic - to - triadic query language deriving from datalog , which he calls trilog , is not ( unlike our skies ) intrinsically recursive . but his analysis depends upon recursive arguments built atop it , and his key constructs are strongly resonant with our own ( explicitly recursive ) ones .",
    "we focus on just a few to make the point , with the aim of provoking interest in fusing approaches , rather than in proving any particular results .",
    "the still - standard technology of relational databases based on sql statements ( most broadly marketed under the oracle label ) was itself derived from peirce s triadic thinking : the creator of the relational formalism , edgar f. `` ted '' codd , was a phd student of peirce editor and scholar arthur w. burks .",
    "codd s triadic `` relations , '' as robertson notes ( and as peirce first recognized , he tells us , in 1885 ) , are `` the minimal , and thus most uniform '' representations `` where metadata , that is data about data , is treated uniformly with regular data . '' in codd s hands ( and in those of his market - oriented imitators in the sql arena ) , metadata was `` relegated to an essentially syntactic role '' [ 13 , p. 1 ]  a role quite appropriate to the applications and technological limitations of the 1970 s , but inadequate for the huge and/or highly dynamic schemata that are increasingly proving critical in bioinformatics , satellite data interpretation , google server - farm harvesting , and so on . as robertson sums up the situation motivating his own work ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ heterogeneous situations , where diverse schemata represent semantically similar data , illustrate the problems which arise when one person s semantics is another s syntax  the physical `` data dependence '' that relational technology was designed to avoid has been replaced by a structural data dependence .",
    "hence we see the need to [ use ] a simple , uniform relational representation where the data / metadata distinction is not frozen in syntax .",

    "_ joins _ between variously keyed tables of data is seminal to robertson s approach as well as codd s . and",
    "while the rdf formalism of the semantic web ( the representational mechanism for describing structures as well as contents of web artifacts on the world wide web ) is likewise explicitly triadic , there has , to date , been no formal mechanism put in place for manipulating information in rdf format .",
    "hence , `` there is no natural way to restrict output of these mechanisms to triples , except by fiat '' [ 13 , p. 4",
    "] , much less any sophisticated rule - based apparatus like codd s `` normal forms '' for querying and tabulating such data .",
    "it is no surprise , then , that robertson s `` fundamental operation on triadic relations is a particular three - way join which takes explicit advantage of the triadic structure of its operands . ''",
    "this _ triadic join _",
    ", meanwhile , `` results in another triadic relation , thus providing the closure required of an algebra . '' [ 13 , p. 6 ]    parsing robertson s compact symbolic expressions into something close to standard english , the trijoin of three triadic relations r , s , t is defined as some @xmath10 selected from the universe of possibilities @xmath386 , such that @xmath387 , @xmath388 , and @xmath389 .",
    "this relation , he argues , is the most fundamental of all the operators he defines .",
    "when supplemented with a few constant relations ( analogs of tarski s `` infinite constants '' embodied in the four binary relations of universality of all pairs , identity of all equal pairs , diversity of all unequal pairs , and the empty set ) , it can express all the standard monotonic operators ( thereby excluding , among his primitives , only the relative complement ) .",
    "how does this compare with our zd setup , and the workings of skies ?",
    "for one thing , infinite constants , of a type akin to tarski s , are embodied in the fact that any full meta - fractal requires the use of an infinite @xmath7 , which sits atop an endless cascade of singleton leftmost bits , determining for any given @xmath40 an indefinite tower of zds .",
    "one of the core operators massaging robertson s triads is the _ flip _ , which fixes one component of a relation while interchanging the other two @xmath229 but our rule 2 is just the recursive analog of this , allowing one to move up and down towers of values with great flexibilty ( allowing , as well , on and off switching effecting whole ensembles ) .",
    "the integer triads upon which our entire apparatus depends are a gift of nature , not dictated `` by fiat , '' and give us a natural basis for generating and tracking unique ids with which to `` tag '' and `` unpack '' data ( with `` storage '' provided free of charge by the empty spaces of our meta - fractals : the `` atoms '' of semiotic squares have four long - diagonal slots each , one per each of the `` controls '' petitot s catastrophe theory reading calls for , and so on . )    finally , consider two dual constructions that are the core of our own triadic number theory : if the @xmath10 of last paragraph , for instance , be taken as a zigzag s l - index set , then the other trio of triples correlates quite exactly with the zigzag u - trips . and this 3-to-1 relation , recall , exactly parallels that between the 3 trefoil , and 1 zigzag , sails defining a box - kite , with this very parallel forming the support for the recursion that ultimately lifts us up into a sky .",
    "we can indeed make this comparison to robinson s formalism exceedingly explicit : if his x , y , z be considered the angular nodes of psl(2,7 ) situated at the 12 oclock apex and the right and left corners respectively , then his @xmath10 correspond exactly to our own rule 0 trip s same - lettered indices !    here , we would point out that these two threads of reflection  on underwriting chaos with cellular - automaton - tied number theory , and designing new kinds of database architectures  are hardly unrelated .",
    "it should be recalled that two years prior to his revolutionary 1970 paper on relational databases [ 14 ] , codd published a pioneering book on cellular automata [ 15 ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that one of the earliest technologies to be spawned by fractals arose in the arena of data compression of images , as epitomized in the work of michael barnsley and his iterative systems company .",
