    "as an alternative gravitational theory , the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory has attracted considerable attention . this theory is proposed by bekenstein @xcite as a relativistic theory of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite , and teves reproduces mond in the weak acceleration limit .",
    "the most important advantage to adopt teves might be the point to be possible to explain many galactic and cosmological observations without the need for dark matter @xcite . in teves",
    ", one has successfully explained the galaxy rotation curves and tully - fisher law without the existence of dark matter @xcite .",
    "additionally , teves is possible to explain not only the strong gravitational lensing @xcite , but also the galaxy distribution through an evolving universe @xcite without cold dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , in the strong - field regime of teves , giannios found the black hole solution by solving the field equations for static , spherically symmetric spacetime in vacuum @xcite , i.e. , this corresponds to the schwarzschild solution in the general relativity ( gr ) , where he found two distinct branches of solutions dependent on the form of the vector field .",
    "subsequently , sagi and bekenstein generalized the schwarzschild solution in teves to the reissner - nordstrm solution @xcite , while lasky , sotani , and giannios derived the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations and they produced the neutron star models in teves @xcite .",
    "recently , it was discussed the possibilities of distinguishing teves from gr .",
    "for example , it was suggested that one can distinguish the gravitational theory with the redshift of the atomic spectral lines emanating from the surface of neutron stars @xcite or with the observations of neutron star oscillations via the emitted gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "additionally , desai , kahya , and woodard pointed out another test of teves @xcite , where they showed that there is an appreciable difference in the shapiro delays of gravitational waves and photons or neutrinos from the same source and suggested the possibility to test of teves by observing this difference emitted from gamma ray bursts or core - collapse supernovae . in this article",
    ", we examine whether observations of gravitational waves emitted from the neutron stars can provide an alternative way of probing the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime , where we focus especially on the gravitational waves associated with the oscillation of spacetime itself .",
    "in fact , the tests of gravitational theories in the strong - field regime are quite important , because the gravitational theories in the strong - field regime are still largely unconstrained by observations in contrast to those in the weak - field regime , which have been subject to numerous experimental tests . however , owing to the developments in observational technology , it is becoming possible to observe compact objects with high accuracy . via the observations of x - rays and/or gamma rays emitted from compact objects",
    ", one can know the properties of compact objects and could use as a direct test of the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime . as an alternative way to observe compact objects ,",
    "the gravitational waves are also expected to obtain the raw information of the compact objects . with these observational properties ,",
    "it might be possible to distinguish the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it has been suggested that the observations of gravitational waves can provide a unique tool not only for estimating the stellar parameters such as mass , radius , rotation rate , magnetic field , and equation of state ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but also for verifying the gravitational theory , which is called  gravitational - wave asteroseismology \" .",
    "furthermore , the detailed analysis of the gravitational waves also makes it possible to determine the radius of accretion disk around supermassive black hole @xcite or to know the magnetic effects during the stellar collapse @xcite .",
    "the eigenmodes , which are mainly excited during the formation of a neutron star or during the starquakes and emit detectable gravitational waves with the ground - based gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , geo600 , virgo , and tama300 , are the fluid @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes and the @xmath0 modes @xcite , which are associated with oscillations of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "the possibility to distinguish teves from gr by using the fluid oscillations ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes ) has been already discussed in @xcite , where the cowling approximation was adopted .",
    "thus in this article we focus on the @xmath0 modes .",
    "the @xmath0 modes are similar to quasinormal modes of black holes .",
    "they have higher frequencies and shorter damping times than the fluid modes , i.e. , in gr the typical frequencies are around 7  12 khz and damping times are order of 0.1 ms . in general , the oscillations on the spherically symmetric spacetime can be classified as axial and polar depending on their parity . since the axial @xmath0 modes are known to have the same qualitative behavior as the polar @xmath0 modes in gr , in this article we will examine only the axial @xmath0 modes . moreover ,",
    "for simplicity , we consider the perturbations of scalar and tensor fields while those of vector field will be omitted in this article .",
    "the more complicated analysis of the polar @xmath0 modes and/or including the perturbations of vector field will be seen somewhere .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our notation and briefly introduce the theoretical framework of teves . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we derive the perturbation equations for the axial perturbations .",
    "then the oscillation spectra of neutron stars in teves are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , finally we discuss the results related to gravitational wave asteroseismology in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] . in this article",
    ", we adopt the unit of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we mention the stellar models in teves .",
    "teves is based on three dynamical gravitational fields , such as an einstein metric @xmath7 , a timelike 4-vector field @xmath8 , and a scalar field @xmath9 , in addition to a nondynamical scalar field @xmath10 .",
    "the vector field fulfills the normalization condition @xmath11 and the physical metric is given by @xmath12 all quantities in the physical frame are denoted with a tilde , and any quantity without a tilde is in the einstein frame . varying the total action with respect to @xmath13",

( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) in @xcite .",
    "notice that the conservation of energy - momentum is given in the physical frame as @xmath20 . additionally , by varying the total action with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath9 , one obtains the field equations for the vector and scalar fields as eqs .",
    "( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) in @xcite , which include two positive dimensionless parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these are the coupling parameters for the scalar and vector fields respectively .",
    "a static , spherically symmetric metric in einstein frame can be expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while the vector field can be given as @xmath27 . in this article",
    "we set @xmath28=0 , because it has shown that in vacuum , the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) coefficients for a spherically symmetric , static spacetime with a non - zero @xmath29 can violate observational restrictions @xcite . then with the normalization condition",
    "one can show that @xmath30 . with this vector field ,",
    "the physical metric is @xmath31 finally we assume that the stellar matter consists of a perfect fluid @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the four - velocity of the fluid , the total energy density , and the pressure in the physical frame .",
    "the concrete neutron star models in teves can be seen in the previous papers @xcite .    to construct the stellar models in teves , three new parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath36 ,",
    "are introduced with respect to gr , where @xmath36 denotes the cosmological value of the scalar field .",
    "the value of @xmath22 has a tightly constraint as @xmath37 by both cosmological models and also planetary motions in the solar system , while the cosmological considerations imply that the value of @xmath36 is restricted to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "with respect to the value of @xmath36 , it was shown that @xmath36 could have a minimum value of around @xmath39 , which is based on the causality issues inside the star @xcite . anyway , since it was also found in @xcite that the neutron star models are almost independent from the values of @xmath22 and @xmath36 , in this article we make examinations with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand , although we pointed out in @xcite the possibility to determine the value of @xmath23 with the observations of gravitational waves related to the stellar oscillations , so far there is no severe restriction on @xmath23 except that @xmath23 should be in the range of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "thus in this article we adopt various values of @xmath23 in the range of @xmath42 and study the dependence of gravitational waves on the parameter @xmath23 . furthermore , as equilibrium stellar models , in this article we adopt the similar models in @xcite , i.e. , two different eoss such as eos a and eos ii .    at the end of this section ,",
    "we introduce two useful properties , i.e. , the total arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xmath43 and the scalar mass @xmath44 , which are defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass function evaluated at radial infinity .",
    "notice that the scalar mass is constant outside the star , while with adm mass one can describe the asymptotic behavior of the physical metric as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "as mentioned before , for simplicity we assume that @xmath49 in this article , where the subscript @xmath50 corresponds to @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "in fact there is no physical reason for this assumption .",
    "but in order to construct the neutron star models with the observed masses , the value of the coupling constant for vector field , @xmath23 , should be smaller than at most @xmath54 , which depends on the adopted eos @xcite .",
    "so since one could expect that with smaller value of @xmath23 the effect of the vector - field perturbation on the spacetime oscillations might be small , in this paper as a first step we neglect this type of perturbation to make our problem simple .",
    "( also see in appendix [ sec : appendix_0 ] for the effect of the vector - field perturbation on the spacetime oscillations . )",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath55 and @xmath56 even with the assumption that @xmath49 , which are results from the metric perturbations .",
    "under this situation , the perturbations of the scalar and vector fields are expressed as @xmath57 while , using the regge - wheeler gauge , the perturbed metric tensor in the physical frame is given as @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the _ axial _ part of metric perturbations @xmath60 and @xmath61 denotes the _ polar _ part of metric perturbations @xmath62 here , the functions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 describing the spacetime perturbations have only radial and temporal dependence while @xmath69 is the spherical harmonic function . since , from eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) , the perturbed metric tensor in the physical frame is connected to that in the einstein frame @xmath70 as @xmath71 the perturbed metric tensor in the einstein frame is @xmath72 this expression of @xmath70 is used when the perturbations in the einstein frame will be transformed back to the physical frame .",
    "now , by defining the new set of perturbation functions , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , as follows @xmath79 the perturbed metric in the einstein frame is simplified considerably and reduced to the  standard \" regge - wheeler form of perturbed spherical metric .",
    "here we emphasize that the scalar perturbation @xmath80 is linked only with the polar perturbations @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , while the axial perturbations @xmath63 and @xmath64 are affected only by the contribution of the scalar field to the background .",
    "the perturbation equations for the gravitational waves can be obtained by taking the variation of tensor field equations ( [ einstein ] ) . in order to derive the perturbation equations",
    ", we define the variations of pressure and energy density in physical frame as @xmath81 while the variation of four - velocity in physical frame as @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are functions of @xmath88 and @xmath89 . using these definitions , from the @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 components of linearized einstein equations ,",
    "we get @xmath94 where the explicit expressions of @xmath95 and @xmath96 are given in appendix [ sec : appendix_1 ] .",
    "notice that @xmath95 are some linear combinations of polar perturbation functions , while @xmath96 consist of only axial perturbation functions .",
    "furthermore , from the @xmath97 component and the subtraction of @xmath98 and @xmath99 components , one obtains two more equations @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 describe polar and axial type perturbations , respectively ( see appendix [ sec : appendix_1 ] ) , while @xmath103 and @xmath104 are defined as @xmath105 additionally , from the @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 components and the sum of the @xmath98 and @xmath99 components , one can get four more equations @xmath109 but we do not care these expressions in this article since these equations are corresponding to polar perturbations .    then , by taking the product of eqs .",

    "( [ polar ] ) describe the polar perturbations , while eqs .",
    "( [ axial ] ) describe the axial perturbations .",
    "it is worth noticing that the analytic expressions for eqs .",
    "( [ axial ] ) , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ beta0 ] ) , ( [ beta1 ] ) and ( [ tlm ] ) , do not involve the perturbation of scalar field @xmath116 .",
    "thus the scalar perturbation is coupled only to the gravitational waves with polar parity .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ axial ] ) , one can easily derive a wave equation for the axial perturbations as @xmath117         \\phi = 0 , \\label{eq : wave}\\ ] ] where the new function @xmath118 is introduced , which is defined as @xmath119 .",
    "note that if @xmath120 this equation reduces to the standard wave equation describing axial perturbations in gr @xcite .",
    "as mentioned the above , the wave equation ( [ eq : wave ] ) does not include the perturbations of scalar field and the effects of scalar field will enter only via the background properties .",
    "that is , the axial gravitational waves can be studied independently neither from polar gravitational waves nor from the scalar field perturbations .",
    "this axial gravitational waves are well - known as @xmath0 modes @xcite , which are quasinormal modes describing the pure spacetime oscillations and similar to the quasinormal modes of black holes .",
    "in order to determine the quasinormal frequencies of the axial @xmath0 modes , one can think up two different techniques . the first approach is the direct time evolutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wave ] ) and the frequencies will be determined by computing the fourier transform of the signal at infinity , while in the second approach , one assumes a harmonic time dependence of the perturbations and the frequencies will be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the first approach is quite simple , but with this approach one can identify only those of the quasinormal modes which are excited significantly , and the outcome depends strongly on the choice of the initial data .",
    "additionally , using time evolutions it is quite difficult to identify quasinormal modes that damp out very fast . on the other hand , although the second approach is more complicated than the first one , it is possible to calculate both slowly and strongly damped quasinormal modes .",
    "thus , in this article we adopt the second approach to determine the quasinormal frequencies of axial @xmath0 modes . assuming a harmonic time dependence as @xmath121 , the wave equation ( [ eq : wave ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath122         \\phi = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : wave2}\\ ] ] then , with appropriate boundary conditions , the problem to solve becomes an eigenvalue one with respect to the complex quasinormal frequencies @xmath123 .",
    "physically , the real and imaginary parts of the complex frequency are corresponding to the oscillation frequency and the damping rate of each eigenmode , respectively .",
    "the imposed boundary conditions are that @xmath124 should be regular at the stellar center and that there are no incoming waves at infinity .",
    "in fact , near the stellar center , one can show that @xmath124 has a behavior of the form as @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is some arbitrary constant .",
    "with this boundary condition , we can just integrate the above differential equation inside the star . on the other hand , outside the star , we use appropriate asymptotic expansions to meet the boundary condition at infinity , where we adopt the leaver s continued faction method @xcite . the concrete numerical procedure is described in appendix [ sec : appendix_2 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmodes ] , as examples , we show the eigenfrequencies of @xmath0 and @xmath127 modes for neutron star models with @xmath128 , where the open symbols are corresponding to the @xmath127 modes and the solid ones denote the @xmath0 modes . from the observational point of view , the lowest @xmath0 modes might to be relevant for the gravitational wave detectors @xcite , while the higher @xmath0 modes , i.e. , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , are probably difficult to detect if not impossible . as regarding to the @xmath127 mode , the oscillation frequency is also suitable for detection by ground - based interferometers , although they damp out very fast .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in order to examine how the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory affects on the gravitational waves emitted from the neutron stars , we derive the perturbation equations in teves with the assumption that the perturbations of vector field are neglected . actually this assumption might not be physical , but with smaller value of the vector - field coupling constant @xmath23 suggested by the observations of neutron star , the effect due to the presence of vector - field perturbation on the spacetime oscillation might be too small to neglect .",
    "thus to see the dependence of spacetime oscillation on the gravitational theory , we adopt this simplification as a first step . with this assumption , we find that the perturbations of scalar field couple with the polar perturbations of both spacetime and fluid , but they do not affect on the axial perturbations . since the axial spacetime modes are known to have the same qualitative behavior as the polar spacetime modes ( at least in the case of gr ) , in this article we have studied only axial gravitational waves , which are corresponding to the oscillations of spacetime itself .    with two different equations of state ( eos ) ,",
    "we calculate the complex eigenfrequencies of axial @xmath127 and @xmath0 modes , where the real and imaginary parts of complex frequencies are corresponding to the oscillation frequencies and the damping rates of the emitted gravitational waves , respectively .",
    "we find that the dependences of the both frequencies of @xmath127 and @xmath133 modes in teves on the stellar compactness are almost independent from the parameter @xmath23 and the adopted eos .",
    "the dependences of @xmath133 modes are obviously different from that expected in gr , while the dependences of @xmath127 modes are similar to that in gr . owing to these differences of dependence on the gravitational theory",
    ", one can distinguish the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime by using the direct observations of gravitational waves emitted from the neutron stars .",
    "additionally , we show the possibility to make a kind of constraint on the value of @xmath23 and/or the stellar eos via the observations of gravitational waves .    it should be noted that if one takes into account the effect of the vector - field perturbation , the quasinormal frequencies of spacetime oscillations could be changed with larger value of the coupling constant @xmath23 although the qualitative behavior might be similar to our results in this paper . however",
    ", if our discussion would restrict in the region with smaller value or @xmath23 as suggested in the neutron star observations , we could expect that the behavior of frequencies is almost same as that shown in this paper , i.e. , we can see the obvious difference between the quasinormal frequencies expected in gr and in teves .",
    "so still it could be possible to distinguish the gravitational theory with using the gravitational wave observations , although in this case it might be difficult to make a constraint on the value of @xmath23 .",
    "in this article we focus only on the axial gravitational waves , but the study of polar gravitational waves are also very interesting , since the gravitational waves couple directly with the perturbations of scalar field . furthermore ,",
    "since for simplicity we neglected the perturbations of vector field , more detailed studies are needed including the perturbation of this field as well as those of metric and scalar fields . via these more detailed studies ,",
    "we could obtain the additional information in the spectrum of emitted gravitational waves and one can provide more accurate constraints on the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the consideration of the effects of the stellar magnetic field might be of great important .",
    "in fact , recent observations of quasi - periodic oscillation in the giant flares of magnetar are believed to be related to the oscillations of these strongly magnetized neutron stars @xcite . by taking into account the effects of the stellar magnetic field",
    ", one might be able to set further constraints in the theory that describes gravity .",
    "we thank k.d .",
    "kokkotas for valuable comments .",
    "this work was supported via the transregio 7  gravitational wave astronomy \" financed by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft dfg ( german research foundation ) .",
    "if one would consider the full problem where the perturbation of every field is taken into account , the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "although in this paper for simplicity we neglected the perturbation of the vector field such as @xmath134 , in this appendix we want to see the effect of that perturbation on the metric perturbation briefly . in general , the perturbation of vector field could be given as @xmath135 where the perturbed variables @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 are determined by calculating the linearized field equation for the vector field . with this expression of perturbation of vector field , the perturbed metric tensor in the einstein frame",
    "is given by eq.([p_einstein ] ) as @xmath139 where @xmath140 denotes the perturbed metric tensor in einstein frame with the assumption that @xmath134 , which is corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_einstein ] ) . thus if one considers the coupling of the perturbation of vector field with the perturbations of the other fields , the both axial and polar perturbations are connected to the vector - field perturbations .",
    "namely , the axial spacetime modes should be also calculated together with the perturbation of vector field .",
    "however as mentioned in the main text , since the observations of neutron stars suggest that the value of the coupling constant for vector field , @xmath23 , should be smaller than at most @xmath54 , the effect of the vector - field perturbation on the spacetime oscillations might be small .",

    "<S> in order to examine the gravitational waves emitted from the neutron stars in the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory , we derive the perturbation equations for relativistic stars , where for simplicity we omit the perturbations of vector field . that is , we consider the perturbations of scalar and tensor fields . with this assumption , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the axial gravitational waves , which are corresponding to the oscillations of spacetime ( @xmath0 modes ) , are independent from the perturbations of scalar field and the effects of scalar field can be mounted only via the background properties . using two different equations of state </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the complex eigenfrequencies of axial @xmath0 modes and find that the dependences of frequencies on the stellar compactness are almost independent from the adopted equation of state and the parameter in teves . additionally , these dependences of frequencies of axial @xmath0 modes in teves is obviously different from those expected in the general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> thus the direct observations of gravitational waves could reveal the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime . </S>"
