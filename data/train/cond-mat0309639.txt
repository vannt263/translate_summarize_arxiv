    "the use of hydrodynamic - like type equations to describe the macroscopic behavior of granular media under rapid flow conditions has been widely recognized in the past few years .",
    "the main difference from ordinary fluids is the dissipative character of collisions which leads to modifications of the navier - stokes equations . in order to gain some insight into the derivation of hydrodynamics from a kinetic theory point of view ,",
    "an idealized model is usually considered : a system composed by smooth hard spheres with inelastic collisions . in the low - density regime ,",
    "the above issue can be addressed by using the boltzmann kinetic theory conveniently modified to account for inelastic collisions @xcite . in this case , assuming the existence of a _",
    "solution for sufficiently long space and time scales , the chapman ",
    "enskog method @xcite can be applied to solve the boltzmann equation and determine the explicit form of the transport coefficients .",
    "this objective has been widely covered in the case of a monocomponent gas @xcite , where all the particles have the same mass and size .",
    "nevertheless , a real granular system is generally composed by particles with different mass densities and sizes , which leads to many interesting phenomena observed in nature and experiments such as separation or segregation .",
    "needless to say , the determination of the transport coefficients of a _ multicomponent _ granular fluid is much more complicated than in the case of a monocomponent system .",
    "several attempts to get those coefficients from the boltzmann equation began time ago @xcite , but the technical difficulties for the analysis entailed approximations that limited their range of validity ( quasielastic limit ) .",
    "in particular , all these works assume energy equipartition and consequently , the partial temperatures @xmath1 are made equal to the global granular temperature @xmath2 .",
    "however , the failure of energy equipartition in granular fluids @xcite has also been confirmed by computer simulations @xcite and even observed in recent experiments @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "previous studies for granular mixtures based on a single temperature must be reexamined by theories which take into account the effect of temperature differences on the transport coefficients .",
    "for this reason , recently garz and dufty @xcite have carried out a derivation of hydrodynamics for a granular binary mixture at low - density that accounts for nonequipartition of granular energy .",
    "their results provide a description of hydrodynamics in granular mixtures valid a priori over the broadest parameter range and not limited to nearly elastic particles . on the other hand , from a practical point of view",
    ", the expressions for the transport coefficients were obtained by considering the leading terms in a sonine polynomial expansion of the distribution functions . in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient ,",
    "the first sonine predictions compare quite well with a numerical solution of the boltzmann equation in the uniform shear flow state @xcite obtained from the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method @xcite .",
    "exceptions to this agreement are extreme mass or size ratios and strong dissipation . these discrepancies could be mitigated in part if one considers higher - order terms in the sonine polynomial expansion .",
    "the evaluation of the transport coefficients for a granular binary mixture beyond the first sonine approximation is quite a hard task , due mainly to the coupling among the different integral equations associated with the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "for this reason , to make some progress into this problem , one needs to study some specific simple situations . here",
    ", we consider the special case in which one of the components ( say , for instance , species 1 ) is present in _ tracer _ concentration .",
    "the tracer problem is more amenable to be treated analytically since the tracer particles ( impurities ) are enslaved to the granular gas and there are fewer parameters . in this situation",
    ", one can assume that the granular gas ( excess component ) is not affected by the presence of impurities so that its velocity distribution function @xmath3 verifies the ( closed ) nonlinear boltzmann equation .",
    "moreover , the mole fraction of impurities is so small that one can also neglect collisions among tracer particles in their corresponding kinetic equation . as a consequence ,",
    "the velocity distribution function @xmath4 of impurities verifies the linear boltzmann  lorentz equation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the diffusion coefficient of impurities immersed in a low - density granular gas undergoing the so - called homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) .",
    "it corresponds to a homogeneous state where the temperature uniformly decreases in time due to dissipation in collisions .",
    "diffusion of impurities in a homogeneous gas is perhaps the simplest nonequilibrium problem one can think of .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 is obtained by solving the boltzmann - lorentz equation by means of the chapman  enskog method through the first order in the concentration gradient . as in the elastic case , the coefficient @xmath0 is expressed in terms of the solution of a linear integral equation that can be solved by making an expansion in sonine polynomials . an important simplification with respect to the case of arbitrary composition @xcite",
    "is that the diffusion coefficient satisfies a _ closed _ equation and so is not coupled to the remaining transport coefficients .",
    "this simplifies enormously the procedure of getting the different sonine approximations .",
    "here , we have retained up to the second sonine approximation and have determined @xmath0 in terms of the coefficients of restitution for the impurity  gas and gas  gas collisions , and the parameters of the system ( masses and sizes ) . as for the shear viscosity coefficient @xcite , kinetic theory predictions",
    "are also compared with numerical solutions of the boltzmann ",
    "lorentz equation by using the dsmc method . in the simulations ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is computed from the mean - square displacement of impurities once a transformation to dimensionless variables allows one to get a stationary diffusion equation .",
    "some related papers studying diffusion in a homogeneous granular gas have been published earlier .",
    "thus , brilliantov and pschel @xcite obtained the self - diffusion coefficient ( when impurities and gas particles are mechanically equivalent particles ) from a cumulant expansion of the velocity autocorrelation function , while brey _",
    "@xcite evaluated this coefficient in the first sonine approximation by means of the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion . in the latter work",
    ", the authors also performed monte carlo simulations and found a good agreement between theory and simulation .",
    "the dynamics of a heavy impurity particle in a gas of much lighter particles has been also studied from the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this ( asymptotic ) theory have also been confirmed by monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "more recently , dufty _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied the familiar methods of linear response theory to get green - kubo and einstein representations of diffusion coefficient in terms of the velocity and mean - square displacement correlation functions .",
    "these correlation functions were also evaluated approximately considering the leading cumulant approximation .",
    "this result coincides with the one obtained from the chapman ",

    "the expression for the diffusion coefficient obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite has been also compared with results from molecular - dynamics simulations @xcite over a wide range of density and inelasticity , for the particular case of self - diffusion .",
    "the comparison shows that the approximate theory is in good agreement with simulation data up to moderate densities and degrees of inelasticity , although large discrepancies exist at high density and large dissipation",
    ". however , these deviations from the enskog model are primarily due to the effect of an unstable long wavelength shear mode in the system .",
    "our work complements and extends the results obtained in previous studies in two aspects : first , our chapman ",
    "enskog solution is more accurate since incorporates higher order sonine polynomials , and second , our simulations cover a range of values of the ratios of mass and particles sizes where the effect of energy nonequipartition on diffusion is in general quite important @xcite . the diffusion phenomenon in granular shear flows",
    "has also been widely studied by computer simulations @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite and real experiments @xcite . in this situation , due to the presence of shear flow ,",

    "the good agreement found here over quite a wide range of values of the coefficient of restitution and mass and size ratios is an additional evidence of the validity of the hydrodynamic description to analyze some states of granular fluids .",
    "one of the main features of our theory is that it incorporates the effect of energy nonequipartition on diffusion .",

    "the results derived here are restricted to the low - density regime , small gradient in the concentration gradient , and to a system in the hcs .",
    "the hcs is known to be unstable under long wavelength perturbations or fluctuations @xcite , with the critical wavelength @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the shear viscosity of the granular gas .",
    "thus , our expression for the diffusion coefficient is only meaningful if the time for instability is longer than the few collision times required to reach the hydrodynamic regime . at low density",
    "this is clearly the case , even at strong dissipation , as demonstrated by both monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "with respect to the extension to dense gases , the enskog equation provides a useful generalization of the boltzmann equation to higher densities for a gas of hard spheres . applied to the diffusion of impurities in a granular fluid in the hcs , the only difference between the boltzmann equations ( [ 2.13 ] ) and ( [ 3.1 ] ) and their corresponding enskog counterparts is the presence of the factors @xmath210 in ( [ 2.13 ] ) and @xmath211 in ( [ 3.1 ] ) , which are the configurational pair correlation functions for the fluid  fluid and impurity  fluid pairs at contact , respectively . a good approximation for these functions is provided by the extended carnahan - starling form @xcite : @xmath212 @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the solid volume fraction . according to eqs .",
    "( [ 5.1 ] ) and ( [ 5.2 ] ) , the correlation functions have the same density dependence only when the size ratio is equal to 1 .",
    "given that the fluid is in a homogenous state , it follows that @xmath210 and @xmath211 are uniform .",
    "thus , it is evident that , when properly scaled , the solutions obtained here for the boltzmann and the boltzmann ",
