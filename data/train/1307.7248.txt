    "the equilibrium loss initiated by kink - mode instability in twisted magnetic fields is one of the leading mechanisms for filament destabilization and eruption @xcite .",

    ", @xcite found that a total twist in one of the prominence threads changed from 5-turns to 1-turn as it raised during filament activation .",
    "they concluded that prominence was destabilized by kink - mode instability and magnetic field later relaxed to a new equilibrium position .",
    "@xcite suggested that in one of the filament eruption events , the injected magnetic helicity via the photospheric shearing motion exceeded the kink instability threshold .",
    "the filament eruption could be triggered by the magnetic reconnection at low level in the solar atmosphere @xcite . in the photosphere",
    "it is seen as a cancellation of magnetic features @xcite .",
    "many times it has been observed that magnetic flux cancellation occurs at the photosphere near the pil @xcite .",
    "if the flux cancellation at the photosphere continues after the flux rope has been formed , it may result in instability leading to eruption ; as formulated by @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that flux cancellation at the pil lead to the formation of x - ray sigmoid which eventually triggers the cme @xcite . a successive reconnection in the coronal arcade can change the configuration such that filament below the arcade can no longer be sustained .",

    "we studied a filament eruption that was formed in the vicinity of active region noaa 11247 .",

    "can destabilize the filament by decreasing the magnetic tension of the overlying field @xcite . along with the flux emergence the long duration",
    "converging motions observed in the vicinity of the filament footpoints can reduce magnetic tension of the overlying field which can destabilize the filament @xcite . the long lasting converging motion can also increase the axial flux of the filament by transferring the overlying field into the underlying field of the filament that eventually increase the outward magnetic pressure on the filament .",
    "the increase in the magnetic pressure can push the filament to a height where the torus instability can set in and drive the filament eruption as has been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .    on the other hand , the existence of the opposite magnetic helicity in one of the footpoints of the filament can introduce a mutual interaction of magnetic field having opposite magnetic helicity flux . in the western footpoint of the filament",
    "there was a dominant positive helicity flux injection in the beginning .",
    "later , there was a injection of opposite helicity flux into the existing positive helicity flux system .",
    "@xcite concluded through numerical simulations that the coexistence of opposite helicity flux would cause a reconnection while merging of different helicity flux system takes place .",
    "the reconnection in the system can reduce the tension of the overlying field and thereby pushing the filament to higher heights in the corona and thus driving the filament eruption as discussed previously . since we observed flux emergence , converging motion and the opposite magnetic helicity flux in the filament footpoint , we believe one or more mechanisms may be playing a major role in initiating the filament eruption .",
    "several of these possible mechanisms are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the more interesting event is the observed rotational motion in the footpoints of the filament when the eruption had just set in .",
    "a possible explanation of the observed rotational motion is advanced as follows .",
    "once the filament eruption starts , there is an axial expansion of the filament flux rope .",
    "if the footpoint of the flux rope is still anchored to the photosphere , the expansion of the filament flux rope usually leads to the torque imbalance between the photospheric footpoints and the coronal counter part of the expanded flux rope .",
    "the immediate consequence of the torque imbalance is the generation of the shear flows at the photospheric footpoints @xcite . at the footpoint",
    "it is expected that unwinding motion reduced the shear at the unexpanded portion and transferred a helicity into the expanded portion .",
    "this would increase the helicity flux of the same sign in the expanded portion .",
    "the filament with sinistral chirality has positive helicity flux in the system . as the filament expands during the eruption , a change in the helicity flux from negative to positive soon after the filament eruption in the western footpoint suggests that there was a transfer of positive helicity into the corona from the unexpanded part of the flux tube to the expanded part .",
    "later , the eastern footpoint also showed the rotational motion and there was a jump in the positive helicity after the initiation of the filament eruption .",
    "this can be attributed to the expansion of the filament flux rope and subsequent torque imbalance as has been suggested by @xcite and observed by @xcite .",
    "this explains the observations of transient rotational motion in the photospheric footpoints and increased positive magnetic helicity flux after the filament eruption .",
    "the rotational motion was no longer observed once the footpoints were detached from the photosphere .",
    "the filament eruption initiated just after the flux emergence stopped in one of the footpoints .",
    "this kind of flux emergence followed by converging / shearing motions will stress the overlaying fields and hence builds up energy in the corona @xcite . in such condition , a small perturbation can trigger the filament eruption . in dynamic plasma , the presence of small triggering agents is not uncommon .",
    "however , in each event the onset of instability could be different .",
    "what is required is to probe the magnetic shear and stress in and around the filament region at least at two heights using vector magnetic field measurements . in future , we plan to study magnetic field parameter changes using vector magnetic field measurements taken at two different heights .",
    "it is also useful to look for the rotational motion at the footpoints of the filaments and associated changes in the magnetic helicity after the onset of filament eruption statistically .",
    "this can provide an important clue to the generation of torque imbalance after the filament eruption and help validate @xcite results statistically .",
    "we would like to thank all the referees for many valuable and insightful comments which greatly helped us to improve the quality of the manuscripts . data and images are courtesy of nasa / sdo and the hmi and aia science teams . sdo / hmi is a joint effort of many teams and individuals to whom we are greatly indebted for providing the data .",
    "we also acknowledge bbso consortia -a partner of global high resolution h@xmath4 network , for providing the data ."

    "<S> the filament was located in a region close to the active region noaa 11247 with its west - most footpoint anchored in the negative polarity plage region and the east - most in the positive polarity plage region . during observations , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic flux was emerging in the active region and also in the plage regions . </S>",
    "<S> the flux emergence was stopped in west - most footpoint of the plage region about an hour before the filament eruption . </S>",
    "<S> a converging motion was also observed for many hours in the western footpoint of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> the filament had left - handed twist and the net injected magnetic helicity was positive in both footpoints . </S>",
    "<S> both sign of magnetic helicity were observed in the western footpoint of the filament where the eruption has initiated . </S>",
    "<S> further , an anti - clockwise rotational motion was observed in both the footpoints just after the onset of filament eruption which lasted for 6 min during the eruption process . the emerging flux , converging motion and injection of opposite magnetic helicity could be responsible for destabilizing of the western footpoint of the filament leading to eruption . </S>",
    "<S> the torque imbalance between the expanded portion of the flux tube and the photosphere may have caused the rotation in the footpoint region which changed the trend in the injected magnetic helicity after the filament eruption .    </S>",
