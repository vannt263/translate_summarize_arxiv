    "with two years running , large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern has accumulated data of 30  fb@xmath2 integrated luminosity . in the early stage ,",
    "most of the discoveries are kinematics dominated . on - shell effective theories ( oset ) which characterize hadron collider data in terms of masses , production cross sections , and decay modes of candidate new particles",
    "plays important role in new physics searches  @xcite . in principle , if there exists the precision predictions of production cross section and decay mode for given mass of candidate new particle , one can also obtain information on its spin .",
    "however , direct confirmation of spin state measurement only comes from measurement of angular correlation . with only about 28  fb@xmath2",
    ", a higgs boson has been discovered with over 7-@xmath3 significance via measurement of invariant masses for four - lepton final states .",
    "both atlas and cms collaborations have found a resonance of four - lepton with invariant mass of 125  gev and the reconstructed di - photon invariant mass also peaks at the same place .",
    "the di - photon final state has excluded the boson to be spin - one state based on argument from landau - yang theorem .",
    "the further analysis of spin / parity measurement of the boson based on data on the angular correlation in four - lepton channel is very compatible with the scalar boson expectations of @xmath4 .",
    "the data disfavors the @xmath5 hypothesis with a confidence levels value of 0.6% @xcite . whether the boson is the standard model ( sm ) higgs then requires additional measurements of its yukawa couplings to the sm fermions .    on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse momentum distribution @xmath6 is not only a result of mass spectrum but also dependent on polarization of spin-1 or spin-@xmath7 particles , while the measurement of cross section significantly depend on the simulated cut efficiency .",
    "consequently , polarization effect may in principle come in for the very early stage measurement of cross section . a full matrix element simulation automatically contains all spin and polarization information",
    ". however , in many cases , searches may involve multi - body final states which correspond multi - body phase - space integration .",
    "a @xmath8-body phase space is @xmath9 dimensional integration with the additional two dimensions over the two initial parton distributions so @xmath10 dimensional integration is then required .",
    "high dimensional integration is technically extremely challenging . therefore , simulation based on kinematic decay is sometimes inevitable .",
    "for instance , gluino cascade decay into lepton final state j j ^_1 j j ^ _ ^0_1 involves 5 body final states in one chain .",
    "gluino pair production with di - lepton final states then corresponds to 10 body and the total integration is 28 dimensional integration @xcite .",
    "the di - lepton plus jets arising from squark pair or gluino - squark production then corresponds to 8 or 9 body final states and 22 or 25 dimensional integration .",
    "the simulation of these final states are typically done by only kinematics in pythia . in this paper , we study how polarization effect changes the measurement of production cross section in particular .",
    "we compare the lepton @xmath0 cut efficiency between study involving polarization and study with pure kinematic decays in different scenarios .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss two examples where polarization play important role in measurements .",
    "then we discuss the chargino polarization in squark / gluino decay and its leptonic decay distribution in different scenarios , for instance , light sleptons , off - shell @xmath1 or on - shell @xmath1 .",
    "we then gives the numeric results of comparison before we conclude .",
    "polarization effect has been widely studied in lep era .",
    "we use two examples to illustrate the polarization effects used in collider physics .    in one - prong decay of @xmath11 lepton @xmath12  ,",
    "the nearly massless @xmath13 is of left - handed helicity and pion @xmath14 is a pseudo - scalar state . in the left - handed @xmath15 rest frame , neutrino @xmath13 is moving in the direction of @xmath15 boosted direction and pion is boosted in the opposite direction of @xmath15 moving direction . while for right - handed @xmath16 , the pion @xmath14 is boosted in the @xmath16 moving direction .",
    "therefore , left - handed or right - handed @xmath11 can be clearly distinguished via the @xmath0 measurement of pions @xcite .",
    "this feature can be applied to search of new charged higgs state @xmath17 since @xmath18 from @xmath17 decay and the leading irreducible background of @xmath19 decay are in different helicity states .",
    "a simple @xmath0 cut in charged pion of @xmath11-tag can significantly reduce the sm background from @xmath19 decay .",
    "a second and more similar example is the measurement of @xmath1-polarization in top quark decay @xmath20 which plays role as test of the higgs mechanism in sm @xcite . in so - called `` higgs '' mechanism ,",
    "the goldstone degree of freedom becomes the longitudinal polarization of @xmath1 boson , @xmath21 . since",
    "top quark is the heaviest particle which acquire mass through electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , top quark couples to the goldstone boson strongly which results in @xmath22 enhancement in @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath1 bosons from top quark decay can be produced longitudinal , left - handed and right - handed , with the helicity fractions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "due to @xmath22 enhancement , one has @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "theoretically , the precision predictions of helicity fractions are obtained by next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) pqcd calculations .",
    "given the full reconstruction of semi - leptonic @xmath31 system , polarizations can be measured by measuring the angle between the lepton and @xmath1 in the @xmath1-rest frame . in left - handed polarized @xmath32 @xmath33 ,",
    "the lepton is boosted in the opposite moving direction of @xmath32 with ( w^+_le^+_e)^2 ( 1-)^2 where @xmath34 is defined as the angle between electron and the opposite direction of @xmath35-jet in the @xmath1-rest frame .",
    "the measured lepton momentum in the lab frame are then softer than the ones in @xmath1 rest frame and softer leptons may not pass the lepton @xmath0 cut . therefore , the portion of @xmath25 measurement also depends on the lepton @xmath0 cut .",
    "figure [ ttb ] shows the @xmath36 distribution in sm semi - leptonic @xmath31 with different @xmath0 selection cuts as labelled in plot from @xmath37  gev .",

    "in this section , we focus on the multi - body final states with leptons due to gluino or squark cascade decays . similar to @xmath38 decay , leptonic decay branching ratio ( br ) of heavy neutralino @xmath39 is typically much smaller than its of @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , br of @xmath39 final state in squark decay is also smaller than squark decay br into charginos @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , leptons largely arise from chargino decay @xmath41 and in this paper , we focus on studying the effect of @xmath41 of polarized @xmath42 .",
    "chargino states are mixture of both wino and higgsino which is determined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the mixing matrix .",
    "we first discuss wino chargino for general squark decay .",
    "decay br into higgsino of squark is only significant for third generations and we discuss later as a special case .",
    "wino is a super - partner of @xmath45 weak gauge boson @xmath1 and the squark - quark - wino vertex = [ -g v_11_l]|dp_r^+c_1 [ wino ] corresponds to weak interaction where only left - handed quark or right - handed anti - quark participates the interaction . as shown in fig .",

    "if squarks are heavier than gluino , gluino three body decay    on - shell and hence , the discussion on chargino polarization stays the same for off - shell squarks .",
    "when the chargino is wino , for all squarks and anti - squarks , one can write down the similar relations as _ l & & d_l ( ^+_1)_l ,   ^*_l ( |d)_r ( ^-_1)_r + _ l & & u_l ( ^-_1)_l ,   ^*_l ( |u)_r ( ^+_1)_r  . on the other hand , for first two generations , scalar quarks decay into light quark states which hadronize immediately at @xmath48  s. it is impossible to distinguish whether the light quark jet is from up - type or down - type quarks . the identical final states then leads to simultaneous measurements of first two generation scalar quarks . however , decay final state of stop is clearly identifiable @xcite .",

    ". the stop @xmath52 , @xmath53 can then decay into _ it^0_1 , b^+_1 where @xmath54 final state only comes form left - handed stop state @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath56 has significant @xmath55 portion , for instance 50% , @xmath54 will usually take 70% of @xmath56 decay .",
    "when @xmath57 is not on - shell where mass difference @xmath58 , the multi - body phase space will further suppress the decay of @xmath59 .",
    "however , in this degenerate spectrum limit , the boost of chargino is small and the polarization effect is then limited .",
    "direct search of chargino via tri - lepton channels at lhc @xcite has pushed the chargino mass to be over 350  gev when @xmath60 is massless but the bound is certainly weaker when the mass difference between chargino and lightest neutralino is smaller .",

    "one benchmark is the light chargino with nearly degenerate spectrum where @xmath61  gev with @xmath62gev .",

    "higgsino behavior is then similar to the wino . on the other hand ,",
    "since the electron / muon yukawa couplings are negligible higgsino decay into lepton is only an effect of on - shell or off - shell @xmath1 which has been discussed in the last part of wino case .",
    "as discussed in previous section , polarization of chargino can be distinguished in third generations squarks decays since the up - type and down - type squarks have different and identifiable final states .",

    "if the mass difference between chargino and stop / gluino is too large , the chargino is highly boosted in the system and lepton momentum in the lower end are then completely dominated by the boost effect .",
