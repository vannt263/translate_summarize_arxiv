    "[ sec : intro ]    low energy supersymmetry has been regarded as an attractive candidate of new physics since it can solve various problems in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "one of the strong motivations of supersymmetry is that it provides a plausible candidate of cold dark matter .",
    "recent precise cosmological observations have provided strong evidence of the existence of dark matter . in particular , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment has determined the present density parameter of the dark matter , which is given by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is hubble constant in units of 100  km / sec / mpc . from the particle - physics point of view , however , this raises a serious question since there is no viable candidate of dark matter in the particle content of the standard model . in supersymmetric models ,",
    "the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) is stable due to @xmath4-parity conservation and hence it can be a candidate of cold dark matter .",
    "it has been widely recognized that , if the lightest neutralino @xmath5 is the lsp , its thermal relic density can become consistent with the wmap value given in eq .",
    "( [ omega_c(wmap ) ] ) in some parameter region . for a better understanding of the evolution of the universe , it is important to confirm or exclude the idea of neutralino ( or lsp ) dark matter .",
    "the first important step of such test is to find low - energy supersymmetry in future collider experiments .",
    "once superparticles are found , in addition , it is also important to quantitatively test the idea of neutralino dark matter .",
    "quantitative test will be performed by calculating the relic density of neutralino , using mass and coupling parameters of superparticles measured in collider experiments @xcite .",
    "currently , cosmological observations have determined the dark matter density with an accuracy of @xmath6 , hence the density parameter of the neutralino @xmath7 is desired to be calculated theoretically at the same ( or better ) accuracy .",
    "as is well known , the relic density of neutralino is sensitive to the neutralino pair annihilation cross section , which strongly depends on mass and mixing parameters of the superparticles .",
    "thus , for a precise calculation of the relic density , detailed calculation of the pair annihilation cross section is necessary .",
    "indeed , in the case where the lightest neutralino is the lsp , the pair annihilation cross section and relic density of the lightest neutralino have been calculated in detail , in particular in connection with the wmap observation @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the previous calculations of pair annihilation cross section have been based on tree - level calculation .",
    "( see , however , @xcite . )",
    "one may naively estimate the size of one - loop corrections to be @xmath8 with @xmath9 being relevant coupling constant , hence it is @xmath10 or smaller as far as @xmath11 .",
    "in such a case , radiative corrections to the pair annihilation cross section may be unimportant for the purpose of calculating @xmath7 with an accuracy of @xmath6 . if we consider qcd correction , however , this is not always the case . if we consider processes with @xmath12 final state ( with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being quark and anti - quark , respectively ) ,",
    "qcd correction becomes @xmath0 when final - state quarks are non - relativistic .",
    "in the so - called `` focus - point '' model @xcite , for example , the annihilation process into a top quark pair , @xmath15 , becomes one of the dominant pair annihilation processes @xcite .",
    "then , qcd correction becomes important when the lightest neutralino mass is close to the top - quark mass due to threshold enhancement of the qcd correction .",
    "( the threshold enhancement is well known e.g.  from the analysis of the cross section for @xmath16 close to @xmath1 threshold @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to calculate the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd correction to the neutralino annihilation cross section into @xmath12 final state and to discuss its implications to the calculation of the relic density of the lightest neutralino .",
    "( in fact , we also have to consider real gluon emission to take care of infrared divergences .",
    "thus , we consider processes of the type @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the gluon . ) as we will see , qcd correction may become @xmath0 . since the relic density of the lightest neutralino is approximately inversely proportional to pair annihilation cross section , this has certain significance for a precise calculation of the dark matter density .",
    "in addition , for scenarios where one of very weakly interacting superparticles ( like gravitino @xcite , axino @xcite , or right - handed sneutrino @xcite , which are recently called superwimps ) is the lsp , study of the qcd correction has some significance . in such scenario ,",
    "the lightest neutralino becomes unstable and decays into a superwimp ( and other standard - model particles ) , assuming that it is the lightest superparticle in the minimal - supersymmetric - standard - model ( mssm ) sector .",
    "then , cosmologically , the lightest neutralino becomes an important source of the superwimp , which is now a candidate of cold dark matter .",
    "the important point is that the lifetime of the lightest neutralino is very long ; in the thermal history of the universe , the decay occurs after the lightest neutralino freezes out from the thermal bath . in this case ,",
    "abundance of the superwimp produced by the decay of the lightest neutralino is given by the freeze - out density of the lightest neutralino .",
    "thus , even if one of the superwimps is the lsp , precise determination of the freeze - out density of the lightest neutralino is also important .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the framework of our study .",
    "then , in section [ sec : qcdcorrection ] , we present formulas for qcd correction to the process @xmath17 . in section [ sec : omega ] , we calculate the relic density of the lightest neutralino and discuss implications of the qcd correction to the calculation of the dark matter density . section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "[ sec : framework ]    in our study , we work in the framework of the mssm . in addition , we assume that the lightest neutralino @xmath5 becomes the lsp and hence is stable . in general , the mass and mixing parameters of superparticles depend on various mssm parameters .",
    "to make our points clearer , we adopt several simplifications .    in calculating @xmath7 , we need to fix properties of the lightest neutralino @xmath5 , which are determined from the neutralino mass matrix @xmath19 . denoting the @xmath20 and @xmath21 gaugino mass parameters as @xmath22 and @xmath23 and supersymmetric higgs mass as @xmath24 , @xmath19",

    "this mass matrix is diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath30 as @xmath31 and the lightest neutralino is given by @xmath32_{11}^ * \\tilde{b }     + [ u_{\\chi^0}]_{21}^ * \\tilde{w}^0    + [ u_{\\chi^0}]_{31}^ * \\tilde{h}^0_d    + [ u_{\\chi^0}]_{41}^ * \\tilde{h}^0_u,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are bino , ( neutral ) wino , up - type higgsino , and down - type higgsino , respectively .    in our study , we adopt the grand - unified - theory ( gut ) relation among gaugino masses . in this case",
    "we obtain the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 gaugino masses , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as @xmath37 then , since @xmath38 , the lightest neutralino is approximately given by a linear combination of bino and higgsinos .",
    "we will see that the qcd correction to the process @xmath39 becomes most significant when the lightest neutralino is mostly bino - like but is with a sizable higgsino contamination .",
    "notice that the formulas for the qcd correction which will be given in the next section are independent of the relation among the gauginos .    with the unitary matrix @xmath30 ,",
    "the @xmath40-@xmath5-@xmath5 vertex , which is relevant for the process @xmath17 , is given in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42^*_{31 } \\left[u_{\\chi^0}\\right]_{31 }      - \\left[u_{\\chi^0}\\right]^*_{41 } \\left[u_{\\chi^0}\\right]_{41 }    \\right ) ,    \\label{a_chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 .",

    "in this case , the lightest neutralino is almost bino and its interactions with gauge and higgs bosons are suppressed .",
    "consequently , dominant annihilation processes are into lepton pairs ( as far as the sleptons are lighter than the squarks ) and hence are @xmath48-wave processes .",
    "when @xmath24 is relatively small , on the contrary , higgsino component in the lightest neutralino becomes enhanced and @xmath45_{31}$ ] and @xmath45_{41}$ ] become sizable . in this case ,",
    "the lightest neutralino pair dominantly annihilates into @xmath1 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 final states since they are @xmath51-wave processes .",
    "we also present the interaction of the neutralino with the lightest ( standard - model - like ) higgs boson @xmath52 .",

    "in addition , in the decoupling limit , @xmath54 is well approximated by is given by replacing @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mixing angle in the cp - even higgs sector .",

    "in addition , the phase space integrations @xmath172 and @xmath173 are for the initial - state neutralinos ( whose momenta are @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively ) .    even if the superparticles may not be in _ chemical _ equilibrium , they are expected to be in _ kinematical _ equilibrium since superparticles effectively interact with ordinary standard - model particles in thermal bath .",
    "in addition , since the freeze out of the lightest neutralino occurs when @xmath176 , we use the boltzmann distribution function for neutralinos ; at cosmic temperature @xmath177 , @xmath178 where the factor of @xmath179 represents the spin multiplicity of neutralino , @xmath180 is the energy of @xmath5 , and @xmath181 is the chemical potential .    in order to follow the evolution of @xmath166 for @xmath182 ,",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath183 once the temperature becomes lower than @xmath149 , @xmath184 can be used as an expansion parameter ; we expand various quantities using @xmath184 .",

    "( [ f_x(kin.eq . ) ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ boltzmanneq ] ) , and applying the detailed balance theorem to determine the production term , the boltzmann equation reduces to @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the chemical - equilibrium value of the number density of @xmath5 , which is obtained from eq.([n_x(nr ) ] ) by taking @xmath190 .",
    "in addition , @xmath191 is given by @xmath192 with @xmath193 being the total pair annihilation cross section of the lightest neutralino .",
    "taking account of the correction of the order of @xmath184 , @xmath194 is shifted from @xmath195 to @xmath196 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the thermal bath , neutralinos have non - vanishing kinetic energy whose average is @xmath197 .    from eq .",
    "( [ boltzmanneqnr ] ) , several important features of @xmath166 are derived . when the cosmic temperature is high enough , production and annihilation rates of the lightest neutralino , which are @xmath198 , are relatively high . at this epoch ,",
    "scattering rate becomes much larger than the cosmic expansion rate @xmath170 and , consequently , the number density of @xmath5 keeps up with the equilibrium value @xmath199 .",
    "as the temperature decreases , however , the situation changes .",
    "importantly , once the cosmic temperature becomes lower than @xmath149 , @xmath199 is boltzmann suppressed .",
    "when @xmath166 ( which is close to @xmath199 at this epoch ) becomes so suppressed that @xmath200 becomes smaller than @xmath170 , @xmath5 freezes out from the thermal bath . after the freeze out",
    ", the number of @xmath5 in comoving volume is conserved .",
    "the freeze - out of the lightest neutralino occurs when @xmath201 and hence the lightest neutralinos are non - relativistic in thermal bath at the time of freeze out .",
    "thus , the relic density is primarily determined by the behavior of the total cross section at @xmath202 , as can be understood from eq.([boltzmanneqnr ] ) . when @xmath203 given in eq .",
    "( [ a_chi ] ) is sizable , pair annihilation of the lightest neutralino is dominated by @xmath51-wave processes as @xmath202 .",
    "thus , in such a case , @xmath7 is mostly determined by the @xmath51-wave part of the total cross section .",
    "when all the sfermions and heavier higgses are relatively heavy , the relevant @xmath51-wave processes are @xmath39 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . in our analysis , we assume that this is the case and approximate @xmath204 here , the second and third terms on the right - hand side represent the contributions from @xmath49 and @xmath50 final states , respectively : @xmath205 with @xmath206 being total cross section for the corresponding processes .",
    "we use the tree - level formulas for @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "in addition , we evaluate these quantities at the threshold since their @xmath194 dependences are weak when @xmath209 .",
    "( for @xmath17 , @xmath210 terms are considered unless otherwise mentioned . ) other processes , like @xmath211 and @xmath212 , are @xmath48-wave processes and are neglected in our study .",
    "if we include those processes , @xmath7 may decrease by a few @xmath213 or so @xcite ; once the mssm parameters will be experimentally determined , it will be straightforward to take account of effects of the @xmath48-wave processes .",
    "furthermore , @xmath214 is calculated neglecting the @xmath52-exchange diagram since its contribution is @xmath48-wave suppressed .",
    "we have numerically solved the boltzmann equation ( [ boltzmanneqnr ] ) to determine the present value of @xmath166 .",
    "we impose the initial condition @xmath215 at the cosmic time where @xmath216 and follow the evolution of @xmath166 .",
    "then , we determine the number density of the lightest neutralino at @xmath217 . in our following argument",
    ", it is convenient to define the yield variable @xmath218 with @xmath51 being the entropy density .",
    "important property of this quantity is that @xmath219 stays constant when @xmath220 ; indeed , we have numerically checked that the yield variable becomes a constant of time when the scattering rate is much smaller than the expansion rate . using the yield variable after the freeze - out of @xmath5 ( which we denote @xmath221 ) , the density parameter is given by @xmath222^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath223 is the critical density and @xmath224 is the present entropy density ; numerically , @xmath225    = 0.6    in fig .",
    "[ fig : omg280 ] , we plot the density parameter of the lightest neutralino as a function of @xmath149 . in the figure",
    ", we compare the results with and without the qcd correction to the process @xmath39 ; we evaluate the cross section @xmath226 with nlo qcd correction with boundstate effects ( solid ) , @xmath62 correction ( dashed ) , and tree - level formula ( dotted ) . in the calculation with the boundstate effects , we restrict ourselves to the case with @xmath227 .",
    "this is because , when @xmath149 is too large , non - relativistic approximation used in the calculation becomes unreliable .",
    "fortunately , however , as the lightest neutralino mass becomes larger than @xmath228 , result with the boundstate effects is in a very good agreement with that with @xmath62 contributions .",
    "this fact shows that qcd correction to the process @xmath39 is well approximated by the one - loop formula when the lightest neutralino mass is larger than @xmath229 . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath149 is smaller , difference between the one - loop result and the resummed one is quite large ; in this case the latter prediction ( solid ) is more reliable .",
    "we can see that the qcd correction significantly reduces the density parameter of the lightest neutralino when @xmath149 is close to the top - quark mass .",
    "since the @xmath1 final state is more important than the gauge - boson final states when the lightest neutralino mass is relatively close to the top - quark mass , this fact can be easily understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : csratio ] . as @xmath149 becomes larger , on the contrary , @xmath206 becomes larger than @xmath164 and the gauge - boson final state becomes more important than the @xmath1 final state .",
    "in such a case , even if the qcd correction to the process @xmath39 is sizable , @xmath7 may not be affected so much .",
    "indeed , we can see such a behavior in the figure .",
    "as the lightest neutralino mass becomes large enough , tree - level result becomes almost the same as the one with qcd correction although the qcd correction to @xmath164 is still more than @xmath230 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : omg280](a ) , we kept @xmath210 terms of @xmath231 . for comparison",
    ", we also calculated the density parameter with neglecting @xmath184-dependences ( by taking @xmath232 ) ; the results are shown in fig.[fig : omg280](b ) .",
    "we can see that the resultant density parameters differ in two figures when the lightest neutralino mass becomes close to the top - quark mass .",
    "we have checked that the effects of @xmath210 terms become larger as @xmath149 becomes closer to @xmath233 .",
    "= 0.6    = 0.6    in figs .",
    "[ fig : omg260 ] and [ fig : omg300 ] , we also plot the density parameter for the cases with @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "as we increase @xmath24 , the wmap value is realized with larger value of @xmath149 due to the change of the mixing matrix of the neutralinos .",
    "these figures show that , with these values of @xmath24 , the relic density of the lightest neutralino is significantly affected when @xmath149 is close to @xmath233 .",
    "as @xmath24 increases , however , qcd correction becomes less important in the parameter region where @xmath7 agrees with the wmap value .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ]    in this paper , we have calculated qcd correction to the process @xmath17 , and discussed its implications to the determination of @xmath7 .",
    "we have seen that the qcd correction enhances the cross section @xmath236 by @xmath0 when the final - state quarks are non - relativistic .",
    "importantly , the lightest neutralino dominantly annihilates into a @xmath1 pair ( as well as into @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) when the lightest neutralino has sizable higgsino components . in such a case",
    ", qcd correction may become large and significantly enhance the total annihilation cross section of the lightest neutralino .",
    "since the qcd correction is enhanced close to the threshold by factors @xmath126 , the qcd correction becomes important in particular when @xmath149 is close to the top - quark mass .",
    "since the relic density of the lightest neutralino is ( approximately ) inversely proportional to the total pair annihilation cross section , the relic density may be reduced by @xmath237 by the qcd correction .",
    "thus , for a precise calculation of the relic density of the lsp , qcd correction should be taken into account when @xmath5 dominantly annihilates into the @xmath1 final state .",
    "since the dark matter density has been determined with an accuracy of @xmath6 by wmap and other experiments , this fact has important implications for future studies of supersymmetric dark matter(s ) .",
    "once properties of superparticles are determined in future collider experiments , it will become possible to theoretically calculate the relic density of the lightest neutralino ( if it is the lsp ) .",
    "comparison of the result of such a calculation with the observed density of the dark matter will be a crucial test of the scenario of the lightest - neutralino dark matter .",
    "in addition , even if the lightest neutralino is _ not _ the lsp , precise determination of the freeze - out density of the lightest neutralino may be important for understanding the origin of the dark matter .",
    "in particular , possibilities of very weakly interacting lsp ( like gravitino- , axino- , or right - handed - sneutrino - lsp ) , which are called superwimps , have been intensively considered recently .",
    "if one of the superwimps is the lsp , the lightest neutralino becomes unstable . in this case , however , the lifetime of the lightest neutralino is usually very long and hence , if @xmath5 is the lightest superparticle in the mssm sector , thermally produced lightest neutralinos decay after they freeze out from the thermal bath .",
    "if this is the case , thermally produced lightest neutralino becomes one of the significant sources of the superwimp cold dark matter .",
    "thus , even in the scenario with superwimps , it is important to calculate the relic density of the lightest neutralino .",
