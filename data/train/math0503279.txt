    "let @xmath139 be the free resolution computed by the algorithm , and let @xmath140 denote the monomial matrices defining the boundary maps . since the free resolution is linear , the row labels of the matrix @xmath141 are in one - to - one correspondence with the faces of dimension @xmath142 , its column labels with the faces of dimension @xmath143 .",
    "an entry in @xmath141 is nonzero if and only if its row label divides its column label , which happens if and only if the face corresponding to its column contains the face corrresponding to its row .",

    "conversely , every face can be obtained this way starting from the vertices .",
    "so , instead of computing the free resolution , we can build the fact poset combinatorially if we know the vertex labels , i.e. , the minimal generators of @xmath41 .",
    "we have an implementation of this algorithm using macaulay 2 @xcite , maple @xcite , and javaview @xcite .",
    "when the input vertices @xmath16 are not in generic position , the initial ideal @xmath40 is not monomial . in that case , we can replace the weights @xmath16 with any refinement which makes @xmath40 a monomial ideal and proceed as before to build the face poset .",
    "we can then compute the coordinates of the vertices using lemma [ coord ] and identify vertices with the same coordinates .",
    "we suggest this algorithm without having a proof .",
    "tropical halfspaces introduced in @xcite give us an exterior description of tropical polytopes .",

    "that is , out of the @xmath157 steps we take from the lower left corner to the upper right corner , we take @xmath158 steps up , @xmath159 steps right , and @xmath87 steps diagonally .",
    "the exponential generating function for the numbers @xmath160 of maximal @xmath87-faces of the tropical cyclic polytope @xmath161 is @xmath162 and the ordinary generating function is @xmath163    a face is maximal if and only if the set of shaded boxes in the @xmath37 grid does not contain any corners as in figure [ fig : diacor](b ) .",

    "the proposition follows from basic properties of generating functions .",
    "moreover , every @xmath87-dimensional face contains precisely @xmath165 vertices because every diagonal step as in figure [ fig : diacor](a ) gives @xmath166 ways of shading in the corners , and there are exactly @xmath87 such diagonal steps . from this",
    "it is easy to see that every @xmath87-dimensional face has the combinatorial structure of a @xmath87-dimensional hypercube .",
