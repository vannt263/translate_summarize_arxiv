    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars have dense stellar winds from which free - free continuum emission is observed from near - ir to radio wavelengths",
    ". a significant proportion ( @xmath9 a quarter ) of these objects also exhibit non - thermal radio emission @xcite , which requires the presence of a population of relativistic electrons , in addition to a magnetic field .",
    "the acceleration of particles in these objects is generally attributed to first - order fermi acceleration in shocks within the stellar winds , arising either from wind instabilities @xcite or , in the case of binary systems , collisions of the stellar winds of the two stars @xcite .",
    "the colliding - wind binary ( cwb ) model is strongly supported by high - resolution radio , optical and infrared imaging of the very wide wr+ob binaries wr146 and wr147 , where the non - thermal emission is shown to arise between the wr and ob stars at the point of ram - pressure balance between the two stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the archetype of cwb systems is the 7.9-year period wr+o binary system wr140 ( hd193793 ) .",
    "this binary comprises a wc7 star and an o4 - 5 star in a highly elliptical orbit ( @xmath10 ) , where the stellar separation varies between @xmath11  au at periastron to @xmath12  au at apastron .",
    "this highly eccentric orbit clearly modulates the dramatic variations in the emission from the system , observed from x - ray to radio wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray luminosity rises steadily toward periastron passage , while spectra taken just after periastron clearly show extra absorption that is visible until about phase 0.1 @xcite .",
    "the near - ir emission is characterized by a sudden peak in emission shortly after periastron , followed by a slower decline .",
    "this behavior is attributed to dust formation in the wcr at some point shortly after periastron , and its subsequent cooling @xcite .    perhaps the most dramatic variations are observed at radio wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : light_curve ] ) , where there is a slow rise from a low , apparently thermal state close to periastron of a few mjy , to a frequency - dependent peak in emission of several 10s of mjy between orbital phase ( @xmath13 ) 0.65 to 0.85 , before a precipitous decline before periastron @xcite .",
    "the radio variations have been widely attributed to an underlying synchrotron source viewed through the changing free - free opacity of the extended stellar wind envelopes of the binary system along the line - of - sight to the wcr as the orbit progresses @xcite . however , none of the free - free opacity models explain the radio light curve in a satisfactory manner .",
    "alternatively , the variations may be in part due to processes intrinsic to the wcr .",
    "changes in the stellar separation ( @xmath14 ) alter the intrinsic synchrotron luminosity of the wcr ( @xmath15 ) , and the free - free absorption and synchrotron self - absorption within the wcr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the impact of the razin effect and coulombic cooling increases as the separation decreases .",
    "these processes are dominant at lower frequencies .",
    "inverse - compton ( ic ) cooling of the shocked gas in the wcr due to the intense ultra - violet radiation from the stellar components is important at higher frequencies , and also varies strongly with separation .",
    "we report on high resolution radio observations of wr140 obtained with the vlba that image the wcr at a linear resolution of a few au , approximately the stellar separation at periastron .",
    "these observations are used to constrain the orbit of wr140 , allowing the first reliable derivation of the orbital inclination , the longitude of periastron , and a robust distance estimate .",
    "in addition to supporting radiometry from the vla and merlin , the high resolution observations are essential to constrain models of the wcr in wr140 .",
    "]      a 23-epoch campaign of observations of wr140 at both 8421 mhz ( x band ) and 1667 mhz ( l band ) was carried out using the vlba @xcite .",
    "the campaign was started on 1999 january 04 near the peak of radio emission around orbital phase 0.75 .",
    "observations continued until 2000 november 18 ( @xmath16 ) when the radio emission had declined to close to radio minimum ( see fig:[fig : light_curve ] and could no longer be detected by the vlba .",
    "data were received in dual circular polarizations , and acquired from four contiguous 8-mhz bands using four - level ( 2 bit ) sampling for each polarization , providing a 32 mhz total bandwidth .",
    "the observations were performed using phase referencing ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where regular observations of a nearby extra - galactic background source were made to derive residual antenna - based instrumental and atmospheric phase errors , which were then interpolated to correct the antenna gains during observations of wr140 .",
    "this technique allows the detection of weak emission by enabling direct fourier inversion of the visibility data for imaging of wr140 , along with precise astrometric referencing of the images .",
    "the phase calibrator was j2002 + 456 , separated from wr140 by @xmath17 .",
    "a switching cycle of 90 seconds on a calibrator and 120 seconds on the target source was used , giving @xmath18  hrs on - source time for wr140 at each epoch at each frequency .",
    "the absolute flux scale of the observations was based on internal noise source calibration .",
    "the data were correlated with the vlba correlator in socorro , new mexico , and data calibration and imaging was done using standard techniques in the nrao aips software package .",
    "the resulting phase - referenced images at 8.4-ghz for each observation epochs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xband_vlba ] , where the rms uncertainty of the image background is between 0.06 and 0.22 mjy  beam@xmath19 .",
    "the nominal resolution ( fwhm ) of the synthesized beam is @xmath20  mas@xmath21 , which at a distance of 1.85 kpc ( see ) gives a linear resolution of 3 - 4 au , much smaller than the separation of the stellar components in wr140 for the bulk of the orbit except close to periastron .",

    "<S> milli - arcsecond resolution very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of the archetype wr+o star colliding - wind binary ( cwb ) system wr140 are presented for 23 epochs between orbital phases 0.74 and 0.97 . at 8.4 ghz , </S>",
    "<S> the emission in the wind - collision region ( wcr ) is clearly resolved as a bow - shaped arc that rotates as the orbit progresses . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this rotation as due to the o star moving from se to approximately e of the wr star , which leads to solutions for the orbit inclination of @xmath0 , the longitude of the ascending node of @xmath1 , and an orbit semi - major axis of @xmath2  mas . </S>",
    "<S> the distance to wr140 is determined to be @xmath3  kpc , which requires the o star to be a supergiant . </S>",
    "<S> the inclination implies the mass of the wr and o star to be @xmath4  m@xmath5 and @xmath6  m@xmath5 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we determine a wind - momentum ratio of 0.22 , with an expected half - opening angle for the wcr of @xmath7 , consistent with @xmath8 derived from the vlba observations . </S>",
    "<S> total flux measurements from very large array ( vla ) observations show the radio emission from wr140 is very closely the same from one orbit to the next , pointing strongly toward emission , absorption and cooling mechanism(s ) that are controlled largely by the orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> the synchrotron spectra evolve dramatically through the orbital phases observed , exhibiting both optically thin and optically thick emission . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a number of absorption and cooling mechanisms that may determine the evolution of the synchrotron spectrum with orbital phase . </S>"
