    "ngc 4449 is a bright magellanic irregular galaxy at a distance of 5.4 mpc@xcite .",
    "its absolute fuv magnitude is estimated at @xmath2 , as compared to @xmath3 for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , @xmath4 for the local group sc spiral m33 , and @xmath5 for the sbc spiral m83@xcite .",
    "in other words , ngc 4449 is comparable to conspicuous , star - forming spirals in fuv luminosity , and it is brighter than the lmc by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "this signature of active , ongoing star formation is confirmed by h@xmath7 imagery@xcite , which shows a large number of compact , bright hii regions against a background of loops , filaments , and diffuse emission .",
    "the southern bar is a region of particular complexity , with many bright near - point sources and with bright filamentary structure seen in line emission .",
    "ngc 4449 was observed by the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit@xcite ) during the astro-2 space shuttle mission in march , 1994 .",
    "uit observations on the astro-2 mission were in one of the fuv bands , usually either b1 ( @xmath8 nm , @xmath9 nm ) or b5 ( @xmath10 nm , @xmath11 nm ) . the two bandpasses are similar ; b5 has a longer short - wavelength cutoff to exclude dayglow .",
    "observations of ngc 4449 were obtained in both b1 and b5 . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the 900 s b1 image , which is the deepest one ( figure [ rsh : fig1 ] ) , and the 500 s b5 image , which has the best spatial resolution .",
    "ngc 4449 was also observed from the ground using the goddard fabry - perot imager ( gfpi ) .",
    "these observations , made by k .-",
    "cheng , r. oliversen , and p. m. n. hintzen , are discussed in an earlier paper based on fuv sounding rocket imagery@xcite .",
    "the gfpi data consist of emission - line images in h@xmath7 , h@xmath12 , and nearby , narrow continuum bands .    as a result of analyzing the uit data ,",
    "the calibration of observations reported in the sounding rocket paper@xcite has been revised . in all bands ,",
    "the reported fluxes are a factor of @xmath13 too high .",
    "specifically , any single balmer line flux should be multiplied by @xmath14 , and any single rocket uv flux should be multiplied by @xmath15 .",
    "the off - band visual continuum measurements are affected in the same way as the line fluxes . in the uv case ,",
    "the correction is less well defined because of a somewhat uncertain bad - pixel factor , varying from source to source , which is included in the rocket data , but is unnecessary for the uit data . in summary ,",
    "the effect on any ratio of two fluxes is @xmath16% .",
    "therefore , the modeled source ages reported in the rocket paper are not significantly affected .",
    "the term _ froth _ has been coined to describe a certain morphology of h@xmath1-emitting material outside of typical hii regions .",
    "froth lacks conspicuous embedded star clusters , and it is distinguished from simple diffuse emission by a complex structure of bright filaments .",
    "the froth is thought to be the product of a mixed ionization mechanism , with energy supplied both by ionizing stars and by shocks @xcite .",
    "a substantial contribution from photoionization is likely .",
    "a plausibility argument for this position can be made with a simple application of the fuv image data .",
    "we examine the ratio between h@xmath1 surface brightness in any given local area and the coincident fuv surface brightness .",
    "if the ratio of h@xmath1 to fuv is consistent with that expected from an ionizing cluster , then photoionization is a plausible mechanism . apertures @xmath16  in radius are superposed on 4 regions of diffuse , filamentary h@xmath1 emission and extended uv emission .",
    "the h@xmath7 and fuv fluxes for these regions are given in table [ rsh : tab1 ] , together with the implied ages@xcite , without extinction corrections or background flux subtraction .",
    "the implied fuv surface brightnesses are equivalent to 1 or 2 unreddened early b stars per arcsec@xmath17 .    in the case of compact , bright knots of h@xmath7 and fuv emission ,",
    "the age computed from the ratio of the two fluxes has real meaning as the possible age of a coeval cluster of stars .",
    "ages are computed from h@xmath1 to fuv ( b5 ) flux ratios in circular apertures .",
    "sources are grouped by proximity and a background surface brightness within ngc 4449 is subtracted from each group .",
    "extinction is computed using the balmer decrement , assuming that @xmath18 , which is similar to the orion nebula extinction curve@xcite .",
    "figure [ rsh : fig2 ] shows a map of the compact source ages .",
    "three regions showing a spatial progression of ages are circled .",
    "these patterns may indicate sequential star formation of the type discussed by elmegreen & lada@xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the typical spatial separation between stellar generations appears to be @xmath19 pc , a factor of @xmath20 larger than in elmegreen & lada s galactic examples ."
