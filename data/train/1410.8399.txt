    "the new phenomena that arise when different interactions and orders meet at the interfaces of multilayers ( mls ) from complex oxides with strongly correlated electrons are of great current interest  @xcite .",
    "the versatile properties of the complex oxides provide many opportunities , but they make it also very challenging to identify the underlying principles and interactions .",
    "a prominent example are mls from cuprate high @xmath8  superconductors and ferromagnetic ( fm ) manganites .",
    "they have appealing properties , like the high superconducting ( sc ) critical temperatures , @xmath8 , of the cuprates and the nearly 100% spin polarized charge carriers of the manganites .",
    "studies on yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9/la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath1 ( ybco / lcmo ) mls have already provided evidence for a giant magneto resistance effect  @xcite , a giant superconductivity induced change of the ferromagnetic order  @xcite and a proximity - induced spin - triplet sc state  @xcite .",
    "the latter is a well - established phenomenon in conventional sc / fm mls where it requires a specific magnetic structure with a non - collinear order near the interface  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding magnetic properties of the cuprate / manganite mls remain to be understood .",
    "the ybco / lcmo mls have been shown to exhibit an unusual magnetic proximity effect ( mpe ) that involves a suppression of the fm order of the mn moments on the lcmo side of the interface  @xcite and , yet , an induced fm moment of the cu atoms on the ybco side .",
    "the latter has been established with cu l - edge x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) studies  @xcite .",
    "notably , these cu moments are antiparallel with respect to the mn moments .",
    "a subsequent x - ray linear dichroism ( xld ) study suggested that an orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu atoms and a charge transfer across the interface are at the heart of this mpe  @xcite .",
    "the orbital reconstruction , the charge transfer and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling between cu and mn moments have been explained in terms of a covalent bonding of cu and mn via the apical oxygen , o@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this covalent bonding model relies on the specific interface termination of these ybco / lcmo mls with a cuo@xmath0-bao - mno@xmath0 layer stacking which has been observed with high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem )  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the covalent bonding model and , in particular , how these electronic and magnetic proximity effects depend on the interface termination , on the local strain and subsequent defects and on the hole doping and thus the strength of the magnetic correlations of the cuprate layers need to be explored .",
    "this is especially important since subsequent experimental and theoretical studies on ybco / lcmo mls yielded controversial results which question the direct relationship between the orbital reconstruction and the induced cu moments  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a combined xld and xmcd study on yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2/la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath1 ( ybco / lcmo ) and la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7/la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath1 ( lsco / lcmo ) mls which establishes a direct relationship between the orbital reconstruction and the induced fm moment of the interfacial cu atoms and underlines the important role of the interface termination .",
    "the unique properties of the lsco / lcmo system also allow us to vary the hole doping of the cuo@xmath0 planes and to explore the role of the local strain due to the lattice mismatch between the cuprate and manganite layers .",
    "the pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) growth of the lsco / lcmo [ 10nm/10nm]@xmath11 and [ 8.5nm/8.5nm]@xmath12 ( 9_bl and 3_bl ) mls on srlaalo@xmath7 ( slao ) substrates has been reported in ref .  .",
    "the one of a corresponding ybco / lcmo [ 10nm/10nm]@xmath13 ml on lsat in ref .  .",
    "the xmcd and xld studies were performed at the xtreme beamline at the swiss synchrotron light source ( sls ) of paul scherrer institute ( psi ) in villigen , switzerland  @xcite .",

    "the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) curves were measured at the mn and cu - l@xmath14 edges using the total electron yield ( tey ) and total fluorescence yield ( fy ) modes .",
    "the data have been normalized and background - corrected following the procedure detailed in appendix  [ back_corr ] .",
    "for xld the absorption for @xmath15 and @xmath16 linear polarization was measured with an angle of incidence of 15@xmath17 for ybco / lcmo and lsco / lcmo 9_bl and 20@xmath17 for lsco / lcmo 3_bl . the absorption for polarization parallel to the planes , @xmath18 ,",
    "is directly obtained from the @xmath15 polarization measurement . to obtain the absorption for the out - of - plane polarization , @xmath19 , the measurement geometry needs to be considered since in @xmath16 polarization the electric field has finite in - plane and out - of - plane components . as a function of the incidence angle with respect to the sample surface , @xmath20 , the absorption for @xmath16 polarization yields  @xcite : @xmath21 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 can thus be calculated as : @xmath22 for xmcd the absorption for circular polarization with positive and negative helicity , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , was measured with the same incident angles as for xld .",
    "the magnetization was always first saturated at 3 t before the xmcd was measured at 0.5 t applied along the direction of the incident x - rays .",

    "figures  [ 410 ] and  [ 1201 ] compare the cu l - edge xas curves , measured in the fy and tey modes with linear and circular polarization , of the ybco / lcmo and lsco / lcmo mls , respectively .",
    "they show that both mls exhibit clear signatures of an orbital reconstruction and an induced fm moment of the interfacial cu atoms . for the following discussion it is important to recall that the tey mode has a very small probe depth of only a few nanometers which is limited by the escape depth of the photoelectrons .",
    "the tey signal is thus governed by the response of the cu atoms at the topmost cuprate / lcmo interface .",
    "the fy mode has a much larger probe depth of about 100 nm and thus yields an averaged response of the cu atoms in several cuprate layers .",
    "the orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu atoms is evident from the different polarization dependence of the xas curves in fy and tey mode in figs .  [",
    "410](a)-[410](d ) for ybco / lcmo and  [ 1201](a)-[1201](d ) for lsco / lcmo .",
    "the fy curves yield a strong dependence of the absorption on the polarization direction that is characteristic of the bulk cuprates . due to the predominant d@xmath25 character of the cu holes in the cuo@xmath0 layers , the absorption peaks at the cu - l@xmath14 edges are much more intense for the in - plane polarization  @xcite .",
    "this so - called xld effect is much weaker in the tey curves for which the absorption peaks for the out - of - plane polarization also exhibit a sizable intensity .",
    "this observation suggests that for the cu atoms at the topmost interface the holes are more equally distributed between the d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 levels .",
    "this orbital reconstruction was previously reported for ybco / lcmo  @xcite , our new data show that it occurs equally well for lsco / lcmo and thus is common to the cuprate / manganite mls .",
    ".normalized weight in the polarization - averaged spectra , @xmath27 , of the peaks contributing to the cu - l@xmath1 absorption in fy and tey modes .",
    "the peaks are labeled from lowest to highest energy .",
    "all the values are given in percentages.[results ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , the comparison of lsco / lcmo and ybco / lcmo allowed us to explore the role of the local strain at the interface and subsequent defects .",
    "this is due to the different mismatch of the in - plane lattice parameters which amounts to about 2.5% between lsco and lcmo  @xcite and 0.5% between ybco and lcmo  @xcite .",
    "the similar behavior of the lsco / lcmo and ybco / lcmo mls as discussed above suggests that the orbital reconstruction and the induced fm moment of the interfacial cu atoms are not strongly affected by these strain effects .",
    "nevertheless , the magnitude of the orbital reconstruction is somewhat larger in ybco / lcmo than in lsco / lcmo .",
    "these observations should motivate calculations based on the covalent bonding model of ref .   to detail the relationship of the orbital reconstruction with the splitting and the relative shift of the @xmath28 levels of the interfacial cu and mn atoms and with the displacement of the apical oxygen along the cu - o@xmath10-mn bond  @xcite .",
    "a related effect that deserves further theoretical attention involves the broader peaks above 935ev which according to ref .   originate from transitions into hybridized cu-4s and cu-3d@xmath26 levels .",
    "figures  [ 410](a , c ) and  [ 1201](a , c ) show that these are considerably weaker in the tey than in fy curves which suggests a modification of the local structure around the interfacial cu atoms , for example due to a change of the jahn - teller distortion or the buckling of the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "such distortions may provide a complementary or alternative explanation for the red shift of the 930.5ev peak that was previously interpreted in terms of an electron transfer from the manganite to the cuprate layers .",
    "in summary , with x - ray absorption spectroscopy on lsco / lcmo and ybco / lcmo multilayers we have shown that the orbital reconstruction and the induced ferromagnetic moment of the interfacial cu atoms are common to these cuprate / manganite multilayers .",
    "we have also established a direct link between these electronic and magnetic interface phenomena and we have shown that they require a specific kind of interface termination .",
    "the intrinsic hole doping of the cuprates and the local strain due to the lattice mismatch between the different layers is found to be less important .",
    "our findings support the covalent bonding model  @xcite and related models  @xcite .",
    "they also highlight the important role of the interface termination in defining the spin - electronic properties of these oxide multilayers .",
    "the work at unifr has been supported by the schweizer nationalfonds ( snf ) grants 200020 - 140225 and 200020 - 153660 .",
    "the xas was measured at the epfl / psi x - treme beamline of the swiss light source at paul scherrer institut , villigen , switzerland and the wera beamline at the anka synchrotron , karslruhe institute of technology , germany .",
    "d.m . was supported by the ceitec project ( cz.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068 ) .",
    "we thank mara varela and neven biskup for helpful discussions of their tem data on the lsco / lcmo mls .",
    "to single out the resonant part of the absorption due to the cu - l@xmath14 edges , it was necessary to subtract a background due to the non - resonant contributions of the other elements of the sample . in the following",
    "we describe the procedure of this background subtraction for the example of the xmcd curves at the cu - l@xmath14-edges in the ybco / lcmo superlattice .",
    "the same procedure has been used for the analysis of the xld curves and also for the xmcd and xld curves of the lsco / lcmo multilayers .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( d ) in figure  [ data_cu ] show the raw data for a series of xas measurements which have been performed with an applied field of 0.5 t at 2k for circular polarization with positive and negative helicity . for each polarization",
    "the measurement has been repeated three times .",
    "the tey curves in panel ( a ) exhibit a noticeable intensity drift that is most likely caused by a weak charging effect of the sample .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that this effect can be corrected for by normalizing the intensity with respect to the average value in the pre - edge region .",
    "panels ( d ) and ( e ) show the corresponding correction procedure for the fy data where the intensity drift is significantly smaller .",
    "after this normalization the curves match very well in the regions before and after the edges and can now be directly compared .",
    "the next step involves the subtraction of the background that arises from the non - resonant absorption due to the other elements in the sample . in a first approximation",
    ", the contribution of these remote absorption edges has been approximated with a linear function .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( d ) show the result of the linear fit to the data in the pre - edge region .",
    "the tey and fy curves after the subtraction of this linear background are displayed in panels ( c ) and ( f ) . for the fy curve in panel ( f )",
    "this yields a satisfactory result . for the tey curve in panel ( c )",
    "it is evident that this linear background subtraction is not as accurate .",
    "this is due to the very low probe depth of the tey mode and the circumstance that the ybco layer is buried below the topmost lcmo one .",
    "the cu signal is therefore not much stronger than the background which is dominated by post - edge features of the strong la - m@xmath29 absorption edge near 850ev . for the sum - rule analysis of the spin and orbital moments we have therefore performed an additional background subtraction that is outlined in ref .  .    finally , for the cu - l@xmath14 edge fy and tey curves shown in the main text , we have normalized the intensities with respect to the maximum of the peak at the l@xmath1 edge .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 curves represent the average of the absorption curves for x - ray angular momentum antiparallel ( positive helicity ) and parallel ( negative helicity ) to the applied magnetic field , respectively , as measured for positive and negative field directions .",
    "this reduces the noise level and helps to remove instrumental artifacts .",
    "we note that the xtreme beamline allows one to change the polarization state of the x - rays ( via a modification of the undulator shift ) without affecting the beam path to the sample and thus without modifying the offset or the dispersion of the energy scale  @xcite .",
    "to relate the fitted intensity of the peaks with the fraction of the probed cu atoms that contribute to each component in the absorption , we have integrated the polarization - averaged absorption , @xmath30 , for each peak . in the averaged absorption all the anisotropic contributions are canceled .",
    "its area is directly proportional to the hole density in the cu-3d band , which has been set to @xmath31 , and the number of the cu atoms contributing to the particular transition  @xcite : @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\ & = 12cn_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the fitted area of peak @xmath34 for polarization in the direction @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the number of probed cu atoms where the transition corresponding to peak @xmath34 occurs , @xmath37 is the hole density in orbital @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is an unknown proportionality constant .",
    "the different sensitivity to the @xmath28 orbitals for different polarizations arises from the dependence of the transition probabilities on the anisotropy of the charge distribution  @xcite .",
    "the normalized weight of each peak in the polarization - averaged absorption is therefore directly related to the fraction of the probed cu atoms that contribute to the transition : @xmath40 where the summation runs over the peaks contributing to the absorption and thus @xmath41 corresponds to the total number of probed ions .",
