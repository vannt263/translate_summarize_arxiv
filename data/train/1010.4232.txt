    "deflection of molecules by inhomogeneous external fields is an important subject of molecular physics , which continues to attract a lot of attention in recent years @xcite .",

    "can be realized , including molecular lens @xcite and molecular prism @xcite .",
    "deflection by external fields is also used as a tool to measure molecular polarizability @xcite and molecular dipole moment .",

    "the field induces molecular polarization , interacts with it , and deflects the molecules along the interaction energy gradient . for a polar molecule",
    ", the field interacts with the molecular permanent dipole moment as well .",
    "as most molecules have anisotropic polarizability or / and a permanent dipole moment , the deflecting force depends on the molecular orientation with respect to the deflecting field .",
    "previous studies on molecular deflection have mostly considered randomly oriented molecules , for which the deflection angle is somehow dispersed around the mean value determined by the orientation - averaged polarizability ( or dipole moment ) .",
    "this dispersion was observed via broadening of the scattered molecular beam , and was reported in the `` two - wire '' electric field experiments @xcite and also in the multipole electric field experiments @xcite .",
    "more recently , this kind of rotation - induced dispersion in molecular scattering by static electric fields was used as a selection tool in experiments on laser - induced molecular alignment @xcite .",
    "the field - molecule interactions become intensity - dependent for strong enough fields due to the field - induced modification of the molecular angular motion @xcite .",
    "this adds a new ingredient for controlling molecular trajectories @xcite .",
    "recently , we showed that molecular deflection by strong fields of focused laser beams can be significantly affected and controlled by _ pre - shaping _ molecular angular distribution _ before _ the molecules enter the interaction zone @xcite .",
    "this can be done with the help of numerous recent techniques for laser molecular alignment , which use single or multiple short laser pulses ( transform - limited , or shaped ) to align molecular axes along certain directions .",
    "short laser pulses excite rotational wavepackets , which results in a considerable transient molecular alignment after the laser pulse is over , i.e. at field - free conditions ( for reviews on field - free alignment , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "field - free alignment was observed both for small diatomic molecules as well as for more complex molecules , for which full three - dimensional control was realized @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we extend this approach to molecular deflection in static electric fields , and demonstrate that the average scattering angle of deflected molecules and its distribution may be dramatically modified by a proper field - free pre - alignment with ultra - fast lasers .",
    "an important difference between the scattering in a static field and an optical field @xcite is due to the role of the molecular permanent dipole moment .",
    "dipole interaction with the laser beams averages to zero because of the fast oscillations of the optical fields , however this kind of interaction becomes dominant for polar molecules placed in the static electric fields . in the present paper , we analyze in detail interaction of rotating molecules with the static electric fields ( taking into account both the dipole - type and polarization - type interactions ) , and demonstrate that laser - induced pre - alignment provides a flexible tool for controlling molecular motion in these fields .    in sec .",

    "@xmath9 is the angle between the electric field direction ( along the laboratory @xmath3 axis ) and the molecular axis .",
    "a molecule initially moving along the @xmath10 direction acquires a velocity component @xmath4 along @xmath3-direction .",
    "we consider the perturbation regime corresponding to a small deflection angle , @xmath11 and , therefore , assume the molecules are subject to the fixed values of the field and field gradient ( @xmath0 and @xmath12 , respectively ) inside the deflector .    the deflection velocity is given by :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mass of the molecules .",

    "this formula predicts an _ unimodal rainbow _ singularity in the distribution of the scattering angles at the maximal value @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) , and a flat step near the minimal one @xmath39  ( for @xmath40 ) .",

    "in this work we considered molecular deflection by weak and strong inhomogeneous static electric fields . as the deflecting field",
    "is increased , it modifies the time - averaged alignment / orientation of the molecules .",
    "this affects the dipole force , and we have studied both classically and quantum mechanically the resulting deflection process .",
    "we found that laser induced field - free pre - alignment provides an effective tool for controlling molecular deflection .",
    "depending on the polarization of prealignment pulse , different control actions may be exerted . in particaular , we predict a dramatic increase in the brightness of the scattered molecular beam , when the prealignment pulse is parallel to the direction of the deflecting field . though we discussed ( for simplicity ) linear molecules in this work , a similar control mechanism may be considered for polyatomic molecules with more complicated geometry .",
