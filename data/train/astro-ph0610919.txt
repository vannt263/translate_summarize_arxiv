    "binary white dwarfs which are close enough to be driven together by angular momentum losses due to gravitational radiation , and perhaps additional mechanisms , will undergo a phase of mass transfer during which the ultimate fate of the binary is decided .",
    "there are many reasons to revisit these dynamical phases of the evolution of double degenerate binaries today .",
    "chief among these is that a survey of the published literature on the subject reveals that many pieces of the puzzle have been explored in different degrees but we still lack a uniform theoretical understanding of the fate of these binaries for all possible mass ratios , orbital parameters and origins .",
    "ideally , one would like our theoretical understanding to be such that given a white dwarf binary of arbitrary masses and compositions at the time that the less massive component gets into contact , one could reconstruct the previous evolutionary pathways and the subsequent evolution to merger , tidal disruption or stable mass transfer .",
    "the reason for this lack of uniformity is that understanding double white dwarf binaries ( dwd ) in this rapid phase of interaction can be quite complex and demanding , necessitating detailed hydrodynamics , nuclear physics , radiative transfer and stellar structure .",
    "therefore it is natural that different assumptions and techniques are used when one attempts to answer a question relevant to different classes of phenomena .",
    "for example , the approaches adopted in studying the putative progenitors of supernovae of type ia , or the sources of gravitational waves for lisa , or the progenitors of am cvn binaries , are all very different . while we shall not attempt to cover all the rich physics that may be ultimately necessary to have a uniform and reliable treatment of all possible outcomes of the interaction , we will describe these interactions within a single semi - analytic framework , making connections where appropriate to well - known results already in the literature .",
    "our particular motive for having developed the understanding described in this paper is that our group has been improving and running a 3-d numerical hydrocode @xcite which is currently capable of following self - consistently the evolution of model white dwarf binaries through these rapid phases of mass transfer , tracking mass and angular momentum with high accuracy for over 30 orbital periods .",
    "in the course of numerous evolutions in which we controlled the rate of driving by angular momentum losses , or prescribed an arbitrary rate of pseudo - thermal expansion of the donor , it became clear that we needed some simpler insight into the behavior of the models .",
    "this led us to extend the analytic solution of @xcite ( wi ) for the time - dependent behavior of the mass transfer by relaxing most of the assumptions made to render the problem tractable . here , we retain the simplifying assumption of roche geometry , but allow all the binary parameters to vary self - consistently . thus we investigate numerically a system of first - order evolution equations for a variety of cases and recover the wi solution when appropriate conditions are applied .",
    "we then extend our insight to more general cases , and comment on the applicability and limitations of our approach .",
    "while we are still far from the more ambitious goal described above , we think that the present investigation may also provide a useful framework for other workers in the field of binary evolution and especially for those interested in large - scale numerical simulations of these binaries .",
    "many of the techniques and theoretical insights in this paper are applicable to other semi - detached binaries and may have some relevance to contact binaries .",
    "consider a binary having nearly spherical components of masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 and separation @xmath2 . without loss of generality , we shall assume that as this binary evolves from a detached to a semi - detached state , star 2 is the one that fills its critical roche lobe and becomes the donor .",
    "we define the mass ratio of the binary to be @xmath3 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the spin axes of the individual components of the binary are perpendicular to the orbital plane , and that the orbit is circular , the total angular momentum of the system is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are dimensionless constants depending on the internal structure of the components and @xmath6 are the angular spin frequencies . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ jtot ] ) represents the orbital angular momentum of the components , and the two other terms represent the spin angular momenta of the stars .",
    "the form of the orbital angular momentum term adopted above assumes the binary revolves at the keplerian frequency @xmath7 , which is a good approximation if the stars are centrally condensed .    for a fully synchronous configuration ,",
    "it is easy to show that the total angular momentum and the total energy have a minimum at the same separation @xmath8^{1/2}$ ] , where the @xmath9 are the moments of inertia of the components , and @xmath10 is the reduced mass .",
    "even if the orbital frequency and the spin frequency are not synchronized but remain proportional to one another ( @xmath11 ) , there is a minimum of @xmath12 at some @xmath13 .",
    "also the total energy of the system will have a minimum but in general it will not occur at @xmath14 .",
    ", where @xmath15 is the angular velocity of internal motions and @xmath16 is the equatorial circulation .",
    "thus , as a binary evolves driven by gravitational wave radiation , circulation is conserved and the minima of @xmath17 and @xmath18 will coincide .",
    "however tidal dissipation does not preserve @xmath16 and thus in general the minima will _ not _ coincide in the presence of tidal spin - orbit coupling . ]    for our purposes it will be sufficient to work with the approximate form of eq .",
    "( [ jtot ] ) given above .",
    "a more complete and thorough discussion of the secular and dynamical stability of polytropic binaries has been presented in two well - known series of papers by lai , rasio & shapiro ( lrs1-lrs5 ) and further developed with sph simulations in papers by rasio & shapiro ( rs1-rs3 ) , who also addressed the role of mass - transfer .",
    "if the donor has a relatively soft equation of state and if @xmath19 , the binary tends to become semi - detached and mass - transfer occurs before it falls prey to the tidal instability mentioned above .",
    "mass transfer changes the initial configuration as the system evolves and may either drive the system to smaller separations and thus closer to the onset of the tidal instability or to larger separations and toward stability . similarly ,",
    "mass loss from the system can affect the dynamic stability of the system .",
    "we investigate the behavior of such systems ( in particular dwd binaries ) in the cases of conservative and non - conservative mass transfer , driven by gravitational wave radiation ( gwr ) .",
    "a system of two point masses orbiting around each other , in circular orbits , radiates gravitationally @xcite .",
    "the loss of orbital angular momentum as a result is given by @xmath20 although gwr is likely to be the only important mode of angular momentum loss from dwd binaries , for any general form of systemic angular momentum loss @xmath21 , we can re - arrange eq .",
    "( [ jtot ] ) to obtain @xmath22 allowing for the possibility of spin - orbit coupling of the angular momenta .",
    "the rate of change of the spin angular momentum of each individual star can be given as the sum of the advected or _ consequential _ angular momentum transport plus the effect of the tidal torques",
    "@xmath23 the term denoting the advected component from the donor has not been included in previous treatments concerning white dwarf donors @xcite , but has been discussed in the case of evolved donors ( see for example , @xcite and @xcite ) . for this reason ,",
    "a few remarks clarifying the meaning of the consequential terms are in order . in the above equations @xmath24 and @xmath25 indicate the specific angular momenta of the matter _ arriving _ at the accretor and the matter _ leaving _ the donor respectively . in a conservative system",
    "these will refer to the specific angular momentum of the _ same _ material with respect to the center of mass of each star , but at _ different _ times .",
    "we assume that as the stream leaves the donor there is no back torque that could modify the spin of the donor .",
    "therefore @xmath25 is entirely determined by the instantaneous conditions at the donor .",
    "however , the material traveling in the stream experiences a time varying torque due to the binary that changes @xmath24 at the expense of the orbital angular momentum alone i.e. not torquing the spins of either component .",
    "these are the assumptions underlying the standard calculations of @xmath24 and the estimates of the circularization radius which go back to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will discuss later what are the appropriate values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and write down just the general expressions here .",

    "however , in double degenerate binaries there is considerable uncertainty about the synchronization timescales , and in numerical simulations of mass transfer @xmath36 is orders of magnitude shorter than the typical timescales one encounters in long - term accreting binaries",

    "for example , if the material is lost mostly from the vicinity of the accretor , it will carry approximately the specific orbital angular momentum of the accretor .",

    "( [ qadef ] ) , as it should .",
    "[ evexa ] shows two examples of evolutions with a super - eddington mass - transfer phase . because the oae do not include tidal distortions of the components or dissipative effects , arising for example from friction during a common envelope phase , they always predict survival , no matter how high the mass transfer gets during an unstable phase .",
    "the only exception to this rule occurs if during the evolution the binary separation falls below the value @xmath13 at which the angular momentum and the energy of the binary reach a minimum . in that case , further loss of angular momentum inevitably breaks the synchronism and the system is secularly unstable . as the binary frequency increases ,",
    "the spin frequencies of the components fall behind , tidal synchronization torques further reduce the orbital angular momentum , and finally a dynamical instability leads to a rapid merger .",

    "thus we expect a certain fraction of the binaries that come into contact with @xmath104 to survive unstable mass transfer , even if it happens to be super - eddington .",
    "however , to estimate the fraction that actually make it through , one would have to deal with the common envelope phase which is beyond the aims of the present study .",

    "we have compared our oae integrations with analytic solutions illustrating the limitations of the latter . in what follows",
    "we investigate the consequences of the oae when they are applied with all effects included .",

    "the mass transfer rate begins to fall and correspondingly @xmath173 increases rapidly ( see fig .",
    "[ wicomp ] ) .",
    "the synchronization timescale does not evolve as rapidly as the mass transfer rate and eventually @xmath174 .",
    "now the angular momentum stored in the spin of the accretor is efficiently returned to the orbit .",
    "if enough asynchronism has been built up in the accretor during the spin - up phase , the additional injection of spin angular momentum to the orbit can cause the separation  and consequently the roche lobe radius of the donor  to increase at a rate faster than the radius of the donor .",
    "on the other hand , the donor radius increases at a slower rate due to the decreasing mass transfer rate .",
    "this leads to detachment  the radius of the star can not keep up with the increase in the roche lobe radius . in general , whenever the effective driving @xmath175 0 , the systems detach .",
    "eventually , when tides synchronize the spins again , the driving will shrink the binary back into contact and accretion recommences , slowly at first , and accelerating as the separation @xmath2 shrinks and the cycle repeats .",
    "however , as the cycles repeat , the deviations from the equilibrium rate decrease until the system settles to a steadily expanding behavior with the mass transfer following the equilibrium rate closely . in the absence of tidal effects",
    ", one would expect the orbital period to increase monotonically with time once equilibrium mass transfer has been established for am cvn type systems . however , in the presence of appropriate tidal coupling , the systems may detach and this leads to oscillations in the orbital period  increasing when the system gets into sufficient contact , and decreasing when it detaches and the gwr dominates over the tidal terms .",
    "this behavior is evident from figs .",
    "[ evcyc1 ] and [ evcyc2 ] , in which we plot the orbital period of the binary as a function of time for different mass ratios and tidal synchronization timescales .",
    "notice that the number of oscillations the system goes through is a function of both the tidal timescale and the mass ratio . for a given tidal timescale , the higher the mass ratio , the larger the number of oscillations a system is likely to go through",
    "this is because the higher mass ratio implies that the system is more unstable which leads to a higher mass transfer rate and thus a higher degree of asynchronism between the accretor and the orbit . on the other hand , for a given mass ratio",
    ", a longer tidal timescale allows for a higher spin - up of the accretor , leading to more oscillations and higher amplitudes .",
    "there are , however , limits to how high or low the tidal timescale ( as compared to the mass transfer timescale ) can be in order to observe this behavior .",
    "if the timescale is too high , the spins and orbit are affectively decoupled whilst if the timescale is too low , the coupling is too efficient to allow for any significant asynchronism .",
    "thus , in these extremes we do not observe any oscillations .    during the evolution of the binary , the tidal synchronization times change because the masses and stellar radii relative to the orbital separation are changing .",
    "we assume that the synchronization timescales evolve as in @xcite : @xmath176 and choose a normalization ( @xmath177 ) that yields the desired initial timescales .    as has been mentioned above ,",
    "tidally induced detachment has implications for ultra - compact dwd systems ; in particular rx j0806 and v407 . in these systems it is observed that the orbital period is decreasing at a rate consistent with gwr , but mass transfer is obviously underway in these systems ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is at odds with the theoretical expectation that the orbital period should increase .",
    "building on ideas discussed in @xcite , and complementing cases considered by @xcite , we have investigated the possibility of tidally induced detachment .",

    "we have calculated the amount of time the tidal oscillations are in effect in the case of a dwd system after it first gets into contact by loss of gwr for different system parameters . in table",

    "@xmath182 represents the number of oscillations a system encounters during its evolution .",
    "we see that for a given mass ratio , a system tends to spend an increasing amount of time out of contact with increasing tidal timescales .",
    "moreover , the more unstable the mass ratio , the larger the number of oscillations and the timescale for which the oscillations last .",
    "a binary can spend a considerable amount of time in which tides are effective , especially in the case of unstable mass transfer .",
    "in fact , since the systems also spend quite a significant fraction of time out - of - contact , there should be many more systems with short periods than can be observed .",
    "however , even in the most favorable case , a given system spends less than 30% of its time in a regime where the system is in contact and the orbit is shrinking .",
    "thus it is unlikely that tidally induced oscillations are responsible for the observations of @xmath183 for rx j0806 and v407 .",
    "nevertheless , the probability that we catch a system in contact with @xmath183 is enhanced significantly as compared to the case when there are no oscillations @xcite .",
    "for example , for the @xmath44 = 0.26 case the system does not undergo any oscillations and @xmath184 1000 yrs for @xmath28 = 1000 yrs .",
    "a more promising idea is the recent proposal by @xcite , according to which the behavior of these systems can be understood if the donor possesses a substantial non - degenerate atmosphere which allows the donor to shrink as mass transfer proceeds . under these conditions",
    "mass transfer tends to be more stable , at least initially , and cycles are unlikely .    in the next section",
    "we follow a large number of evolutions with different initial conditions by integrating the oaes for @xmath185 yr , in order to address the question of which kind of systems , and under which conditions , are likely to experience the cycles described here .",
    "we explore the parameter space for dwd binaries by investigating the different types of binary evolution that can occur under a variety of initial assumptions .",
    "our procedure consists of selecting the initial masses for binary components and evolving them under driving by gravitational radiation for @xmath185 yr . in the most general case",
    "we include tidal coupling between the orbit and both components , we allow mass loss in super - eddington cases , and we include the transition from direct impact to disk accretion . we also choose the tidal synchronization timescales for either the accretor alone , as in @xcite or for both components allowing even the donor to become non - synchronous . as a check ,",
    "we have evolved a grid of models suppressing the tidal and advective terms from the donor and choosing the same synchronization timescale as @xcite . under these assumptions",
    "our results are indistinguishable from theirs .    before presenting the results of the evolutions ,",
    "we investigate the expected behavior of the systems , focussing on the stability limits and whether the mass transfer is super - eddington or not . in fig .",
    "[ supereexp ] we plot the stability limits for two cases : one with the donor spin properly accounted for ( blue line ) and the other with the donor effects ignored ( magenta line ) .",
    "in addition for each case , we plot the locus of points for which @xmath186 , i.e. , the locus of points that defines a transition from super - eddington accretion to sub - eddington accretion . note that these curves represent the equilibrium mass transfer and eddington rates of the system _ at initial contact _ where we assume that the systems are synchronous and thus the tidal terms are zero .    for direct impact systems",
    "the accretion rate is always super - eddington if @xmath187 ( 0.17 @xmath188 if donor terms are neglected ) .",
    "this is because of two reasons ",
    "i ) in general , the higher the donor mass , the higher the mass ratio and thus the systems are closer to instability , which in turn implies a higher @xmath189 and ii ) the higher the accretor mass , the lower the threshold for super - eddington accretion @xcite .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ supereexp ] , the transition of the systems from direct impact to disk leads to changes in the stability properties of these systems  they tend to be slightly more stable because the loss of orbital angular momentum to the accretor spin in disk systems is smaller than in the direct impact case .",
    "this is reflected in the slight upturn in the stability curve around @xmath190 1 @xmath188 ( 0.85 @xmath188 if donor terms are neglected ) .",
    "the result of this is that the equilibrium mass transfer rate for the disk systems is lower than it would have been for that same system if it were a direct impact system .",
    "consequently these systems tend to undergo sub - eddington accretion , and the locus of the transition between super and sub - eddington accretion systems follows the stability curve for both cases .",
    "however the disk transition ` saves ' only a few systems because dwd binaries with @xmath191 , ( 0.23 @xmath188 if donor terms are neglected ) are all super - eddington initially .",
    "we present now the results of the numerical integrations of the oae for a grid of models in the @xmath192 parameter space . in fig .",
    "[ popsynus ] , we plot the results for two extreme values of the accretor tidal synchronization timescales  one with an extremely large tidal timescale ( @xmath193 yrs ) corresponding to inefficient coupling and one for a short timescale of 10 yrs corresponding to highly efficient spin - orbit coupling .",
    "firstly , we note a significantly increased region ( as compared to when the donor terms are ignored ) of parameter space corresponding to sub - eddington mass transfer and probable survival as a long - term , stable mass transfer binary of the am cvn type .",
    "also , from our discussion above , we expect that the case with inefficient tidal coupling ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ popsynus ] ) to match the curves in fig .",
    "[ supereexp ] .",
    "the transition from super to sub - eddington accretion overlaps the stability boundary until @xmath194 0.21 @xmath188 after which it follows the stability curve defined by the direct impact to disk transition , in accordance with our expectations . on the other hand , since the tides almost always act to stabilize the system by effectively reducing the driving rate , a simplistic analysis based on comparing the _ initial _ equilibrium mass transfer and eddington rates has only partial validity .",
    "while the threshold for super - eddington accretion remains unaffected by the tidal coupling , the mass transfer rate is significantly lowered due to the reduced driving rate , and can be below the eddington accretion rate . systems which have super - eddington accretion rates when the tidal coupling is inefficient , can thus accrete at sub - eddington rates if the tidal coupling is strong . as a consequence",
    "we expect the domain of sub - eddington accretion to extend to higher donor masses , and on comparing the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ popsynus ] this is what we observe .",
    "finally , the locus of systems that undergo oscillations in their separation and binary period is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ popsyncyc ] .",
    "whether a system undergoes oscillations or not , depends primarily on two factors : the accretor tidal synchronization timescale @xmath195 and the mass ratio @xmath44 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ popsyncyc ] , oscillations are seen to occur only in a certain domain around the stability curve , and that domain decreases with increasing tidal synchronization times .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for higher donor masses , the mass transfer timescale @xmath36 is quite short and if the tidal timescale @xmath196 is much longer than @xmath36 , the spin and the orbit are effectively decoupled . as a result",
    "there is minimal return of the spin angular momentum to the orbit and consequently , there are no oscillations for these long timescales .",
    "in fact , referring to fig . [ popsyncyc ] , we observe that systems with high donor mass ( @xmath197 ) do not undergo any oscillations at all . again , this is because the mass transfer rates are high in this domain and thus the tidal timescales ( considered here ) are much longer than the mass transfer timescales .",
    "consequently , the radius of the donor keeps up with the increase in the roche lobe radius throughout the evolution , and the systems stay in contact .    on the other hand , systems to the bottom right ( the ones with low donor mass and high accretor mass ) are stable systems and are more likely to be disc - systems .",
    "thus the accretor is not spun up as much as in the case of less stable or unstable systems .",
    "moreover in the disc systems , tides are extremely efficient in returning angular momentum back to the orbit . both these factors conspire to decrease the level of asynchronism achieved by the accretor and consequently , these systems do not undergo oscillations .    we have also studied the effect of the donor s tidal synchronization timescale on the domain over which systems undergo tidally induced oscillation cycles . in most cases , the level of the donor s asynchronism is rather low .",
    "thus the magnitude of the term associated with the tidal effects of the donor in the driving rate @xmath198 ( eq . ( [ rldotarr ] ) ) is much smaller than the corresponding term for the accretor . as a result",
    ", the donor synchronization timescale has a limited impact on the domain over which the systems oscillate .",
    "one of the stated objectives of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework to interpret and analyze results of large - scale , self - consistent , 3-d hydrodynamic simulations of binaries undergoing mass transfer @xcite . to this end",
    ", we apply the same initial conditions to our oae as have been to the various runs carried out by dsouza et al .",
    "we have the tidal normalization factor ( @xmath177 , see eq .",
    "( [ tidal ] ) ) and the mass transfer rate scaling ( @xmath199 )  such that @xmath200  as ` free parameters ' , which we adjust so as to obtain as close a match to the hydro - runs as we can . in the particular run shown in fig .",
    "[ numsim ] , @xmath177 = 0.75 and @xmath199 = 35.0 .",
    "this choice is not unique  indeed , we get reasonable ` fits ' even for other combinations of these ` free parameters ' .",
    "it should be noted that in the numerical simulations of @xcite the minimum resolvable mass transfer was on the order of @xmath201 , which translates for short period am cvn binary parameters to @xmath202 ! also , in the case of the hydro - runs one observes severe distortion of the accretor and the formation of an accretion belt around the accretor towards the end of the evolution .",
    "these features can not be easily incorporated in the oaes , and so the later stages of evolution especially in the case of q0.5-c , can not be properly represented in the oae .",
    "an added complication is that for the hydro - runs , the driving was cut off after the systems were thought to have reached a deep enough contact . since the effective density levels ,",
    "especially near the edge of the stars in the 3-d numerical model differs from an ideal @xmath203 polytrope due to the finite numerical resolution of the code , the depth of contact achieved after a certain amount of driving for a certain period of time is not necessarily the same for the hydro - runs and the oae runs .",
    "this is especially true for q0.5-a , because it is the one which is most sensitive to the depth of contact at the instant the driving is cut - off . for runs q0.5-b and q0.5-c , the depth achieved is deep enough to make small differences between the hydro - runs and the oae unimportant .",
    "we are working on another set of runs in which the driving is not cut off and the systems are driven at slightly lower ( and more realistic ) rates .",
    "we hope that this will eliminate another source of discrepancy between the hydro - runs and the oae .    despite the above mentioned shortcomings",
    ", the oaes do reproduce reasonably well the behavior of the binaries we have studied .",
    "one notices that the hydro - runs have a gentler slope initially which progressively gets steeper as compared to the oae runs .",
    "this , we believe , is a consequence of the complicated fluid flow around the @xmath49 point and the distortion of the donor star .",
    "moreover , during the initial stages of the evolutions , the 3-d hydrodynamic simulations are subject to numerical noise which is not the case for our numerical integrations .",
    "the relative significance of this noise diminishes as the mass transfer rate increases during the evolution .",
    "also , the epicyclic motion that one encounters in the hydro - runs ( see @xcite for details ) can not be reproduced in our results , since we assume circular orbits .",
    "thus the behavior of the oae is much smoother than the numerical hydro - runs with no abrupt changes in slopes of the various parameters .",
    "we conclude from the above discussion and fig .",
    "[ numsim ] , that the oaes confirm that : a ) tidal effects play an important role in the numerical simulations of the binary , b ) direct impact accretion is an important effect and can lead to significant spin - up of the accretor at the expense of orbital angular momentum , and c ) the oae prediction that systems that are initially unstable can indeed survive mass transfer seems to bear out in the hydro - runs despite the rather extreme conditions to which the binaries in the hydro - runs are subjected .",
    "in addition to the q0.5 runs presented above , @xcite also present other runs which result in the disruption of the binary .",
    "as can be seen from their fig . 3 , 6 and 10 , the donor star becomes increasingly distorted towards the end of these simulations .",
    "the oae , at least in their present form , are not capable of accounting for the distortion of the components and the consequence of these distortions on the fate of the binary .",
    "additional hydro - runs with different values of the mass ratio @xmath44 and lower driving rates @xmath72 ( though these rates are still orders of magnitude higher than realistic values ) are being carried out @xcite . in principle",
    "this can help , for example , in determining a limit on the mass ratio @xmath44 ( @xmath204 ) above which the tidal disruption of the binary is likely .",
    "however , other physical effects not yet included in the 3-d simulations , such as radiation and the formation of a common envelope , are more likely to determine the fate of such systems .",
    "the tidal time scales that most closely account for the behavior observed in the simulations will serve as a measure of the numerical dissipation present in the simulations .",
    "we will present elsewhere a more comprehensive study of the numerical dissipation and its dependence on spatial resolution .",
    "we have re - examined the standard circular orbit - averaged equations ( oaes ) that describe the evolution of mass transferring binaries allowing for advective and tidal exchange of angular momentum between the components .",
    "we found that the mass transfer stream issuing through the @xmath49 point has two effects in the internal redistribution of angular momentum in the binary : 1 ) it delivers a specific angular momentum @xmath205 to the accretor spinning it up at the expense of the orbital angular momentum ; and 2 ) it reduces the spin angular angular momentum of the donor by a specific amount @xmath206 , and ultimately couples to the orbit via tides . in the cases examined in this paper , the effect of this additional term is mildly stabilizing .",
    "for example , with parameters thought to be appropriate for the two short - period , direct impact binaries v407 vul and rx j0806 , the additional donor term is @xmath207 ( see eq .",
    "( [ qstab ] ) ) , so that the net effect of the consequential terms ( accretor plus donor ) @xmath208 , is still de - stabilizing but less than estimated by @xcite , and @xmath209 . its effect on the evolution of other systems",
    "remains to be explored further , but in systems driven by magnetic braking , it is likely to be relatively minor since it is relatively smaller and would be masked by the magnetic torques acting directly on the donor .",
    "we have extended analytically and numerically our understanding of the evolution of stable and unstable mass transfer in semi - detached binaries , with special emphasis on dwd binaries .",
    "in particular we have extended the analytic solutions of the type discussed by @xcite to other polytropic indexes and the isothermal case .",
    "the analytic solutions predict that if @xmath210 at contact , the mass transfer rate diverges in a finite time implying the catastrophic merger of the two components .",
    "the oaes on the other hand , always predict that a binary undergoing unstable mass transfer would survive after a phase of rapid mass transfer which in many cases would reach super - eddington levels .",
    "this is because , unlike the analytic case , in the numerical integration of the oae we allow the binary parameters to evolve self - consistently throughout the evolution .",
    "thus , even if initially @xmath211 , at some point in the evolution @xmath212 , and the systems settle to the equilibrium mass transfer rate corresponding to the current values of the system parameters . while we do incorporate mass loss due to super - eddington accretion , following the treatment along the lines of @xcite ,",
    "clearly the oaes must break down if a common envelope forms .",
    "the treatment of common envelope evolution is beyond the scope of the present paper , but we suspect that many systems previously considered doomed to a merger would actually survive provided that the mass transfer peak is not too high .",
    "this point clearly needs further investigation and probably requires 3-d hydrodynamic simulations with the inclusion of radiative effects .",
    "one interesting consequence of the tidal coupling of the accretor to the orbit is the appearance of mass transfer oscillation cycles occurring for a limited time after the onset of mass transfer .",
    "the likelihood of these cycles is higher in situations where the mass transfer is high , or rises to a high value rapidly .",
    "therefore they tend to occur near and around the stability boundaries .",
    "note that all the systems that undergo oscillations are direct impact systems , at least for the system parameters and synchronization timescales we have considered .",
    "thus it is highly unlikely that systems that have accretion disks will undergo the tidally induced oscillation cycles in the case of dwd binaries .",
    "the presence of a massive ( @xmath213 ) non - degenerate atmosphere on the donor at the onset of mass transfer @xcite can affect the stability and evolution of these systems .",
    "for example , a large and positive @xmath78 would imply @xmath214 , and has significant implications for cycles , stability boundaries and super - eddington mass transfer .",
    "the full consequences of these circumstances remain to be explored further .",
    "dwd systems are some of the most common compact systems in the galaxy and are of particular importance for the space based gravitational wave detector lisa . am cvn systems are guaranteed sources for lisa and the knowledge of possible evolutionary trajectories is valuable .",
    "the framework we have outlined in this paper can be used to generate templates for short period dwd s in general and am cvn systems in particular .",
    "similar work has been done already ( see for example , @xcite and @xcite ) ; but the effects of the tidal couplings and the advective term associated with the donor spin remain to be incorporated into future studies .    the lsu theory group has performed a number of large - scale 3-d numerical simulations of interacting binaries with polytropic components @xcite .",
    "these simulations did not include enough physics to tackle the common envelope evolution , but they should be viewed as the first steps toward that goal . in the meantime , we have used the oaes with suitably adjusted tidal coupling time scales to analyze and interpret the results of some of the simulations described by @xcite .",
    "the mass transfer rates that these simulations can resolve are much higher than the eddington critical rate and probably much higher than the rates likely to arise during the onset of mass transfer in most realistic cases .",
    "nevertheless they describe correctly the dynamical aspects of the mass transfer and tidal interactions under these conditions . comparing the predictions of the oaes with the simulations , we were pleased to find that they predict the outcome of the simulations reasonably well .",

    "<S> we describe the evolution of double degenerate binary systems , consisting of components obeying the zero temperature mass radius relationship for white dwarf stars , from the onset of mass transfer to one of several possible outcomes including merger , tidal disruption of the donor , or survival as a semi - detached am cvn system . </S>",
    "<S> we use a combination of analytic solutions and numerical integrations of the standard orbit - averaged first - order evolution equations , including direct impact accretion and the evolution of the components due to mass exchange . </S>",
    "<S> we include also the effects of mass - loss during super - critical ( super - eddington ) mass transfer and the tidal and advective exchanges of angular momentum between the binary components . </S>",
    "<S> we cover much the same ground as @xcite with the additional effects of the advective or consequential angular momentum from the donor and its tidal coupling to the orbit which is expected to be stronger than that of the accretor . with the caveat that our formalism does not include an explicit treatment of common envelope phases </S>",
    "<S> , our results suggest that a larger fraction of detached double white dwarfs than what has been hitherto assumed , survive the onset of mass transfer , even if this mass transfer is initially unstable and rises to super - eddington levels . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as a consequence of the tidal coupling , systems that come into contact near the mass transfer instability boundary undergo a phase of oscillation cycles in their orbital period ( and other system parameters ) . unless the donor star has a finite entropy such that the effective mass - radius relationship deviates significantly from that of a zero temperature white dwarf , we expect our results to be valid . </S>",
    "<S> much of the formalism developed here would also apply to other mass - transferring binaries , and in particular to cataclysmic variables and algol systems . </S>"
