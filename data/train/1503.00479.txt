    "when a nonuniform chemical reaction takes place on the boundary of a colloidal particle , the interaction of the reactants with that boundary results in a flow field and a consequent motion of the freely suspended particle .",

    "@xcite is the neglect of solute advection , resulting in a linear transport problem governing the solute concentration .",
    "it appears that the first systematic analysis of solute advection in the continuum description was carried out by michelin & lauga @xcite , who considered the relatively simple configuration of a spherical particle with an axially symmetric distribution of chemical reactions .",

    "the characteristic value of the excess - solute concentration , relative to the ambient value , is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is some representative value of @xmath7 and @xmath12 is the solute diffusivity .",
    "the interaction of the solute with the particle boundary is represented as a body force on the fluid , whose magnitude is of order @xmath13 ; balancing this force with the viscous stress in the @xmath14-wide interaction layer provides the pertinent velocity scale , namely @xmath15 @xmath16 being the solution viscosity .",

    "the preceding boundary - layer problem appears similar to that governing the nutrient concentration about a squirming sphere @xcite . in the feeding problem ,",
    "however , the slip distribution is prescribed , and is accordingly independent of the pclet number ; this results in a linear problem with a boundary - layer thickness that scales as the @xmath71 power of that number .      following the analysis of a similar boundary - layer problem @xcite , our approach in confronting  is to calculate @xmath58 as if @xmath70 were a prescribed quantity .",
    "the solution of the linear system  in conjunction with then provides a nonlinear equation governing @xmath58 at @xmath72 . given and , this interfacial distribution is all that we need to obtain the swimming velocity .",

    "indeed , since the function @xmath94 is strictly decreasing this choice results in a negative power in the exponent appearing in , whereby the particular solution vanishes as @xmath91 .",
    "given , the sign of @xmath86 is opposite to that of @xmath56 , implying that the exponent in the complementary solution diverges as @xmath91 for a finite interval of @xmath56-values ( @xmath95 for @xmath96 ; @xmath97 for @xmath98 ) .",

    "interchanging the order of integrations , and evaluation at @xmath100 we obtain , upon substitution of and , the following equation governing @xmath58 on the particle boundary ( denoted @xmath101 for brevity ) : @xmath102 since @xmath101 is strictly decreasing , the local slip is directed in the @xmath103 direction for @xmath104 . given , this implies that the particle moves in the @xmath105 direction . in the particle - fixed reference frame ,",
    "the direction of the incident flow is then @xmath106 . in view of the parabolic nature of the boundary - layer problem , the value of @xmath58 at a certain value of @xmath56",
    "is only affected by the distribution of @xmath58 upstream . for @xmath96",

    "note that the use of the macroscale model of ref .",
    "@xcite within a boundary layer of dimensional thickness @xmath117 implies that the underlying limit of that model , @xmath118 , should be refined to @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , the very derivation of the effective conditions and actually requires @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively @xcite . with the boundary - layer thickness @xmath122 being",
    "@xmath1 it follows that the stringent condition which must be satisfied is @xmath123 .",
    "@xcite estimated that @xmath124 is between @xmath125 and @xmath126 , implying that the computations performed for the largest pclet number employed herein ( @xmath127 ) still fall within the validity domain of the model .",
    "we now consider the fixed - rate model , where the rate - constant @xmath128 of a first - order kinetic relation is specified on the particle boundary ( and assumed axially symmetric ) .",
    "since a characteristic rate of solute absorption is @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is a characteristic norm of @xmath128 , the velocity scale is replaced with @xmath131 the pclet number is now of order ( cf .  ) @xmath132    the limit of short - range interaction is again governed by  , except that is replaced by @xmath133 wherein @xmath134 is the damkhler number and now @xmath135 , which is again an @xmath28 distribution ; since the first - order kinetic describes solute adsorbing onto the boundary , @xmath136 is here non - negative .",
    "when addressing here the limit of large pclet numbers care must be exercised .",
    "given , one would typically envision large @xmath3 due to fast reaction ( large @xmath130 ) or large swimmers ( large @xmath5 ) .",
    "since however both @xmath3 and @xmath2 are linear in @xmath137 , the proper limit to consider is that where @xmath2 becomes @xmath138 .    with a large pclet number , one may navely expect the topology of the fixed - flux analysis , namely the trivial solution with a non - zero excess concentration confined to a thin boundary layer .",
    "a dominant - balance inspection reveals however that no boundary - layer structure is compatible with condition .",
    "this apparent paradox is readily resolved by noting that , if @xmath139 the advective term does _ not _ dominate .",
    "approximation is then rendered invalid , as is then ; thus , no boundary layer is realized .",
    "we therefore proceed under the _ a priori _ assumption .",
    "the scaling of @xmath22 and @xmath25 are accordingly obtained by considering the dominant balances of in the absence of a boundary layer .",
    "as it turns out , the only consistent balance is that between the last two terms in , implying that @xmath22 is @xmath140 .",
    "note however that this is not the velocity scaling , since the present balance implies a uniform leading - order value of @xmath22 ( namely @xmath141 ) on the boundary , so the slip is triggered by the leading - order correction to the @xmath140 concentration .",
    "it follows from that this correction is of order @xmath142 , thus providing the velocity scaling . with @xmath143 ,",
    "this is indeed compatible with . with the fluid velocity being @xmath144",
    "it becomes evident that the leading - order transport is ( counter - intuitively ) unaffected by advection .",
    "following the preceding arguments we postulate the expansions @xmath145 at @xmath28 , condition yields @xmath146 from we find that the leading - order concentration @xmath147 is harmonic .",
    "the solution that satisfies and decays at infinity is the monopole @xmath148 at @xmath140 , condition reads @xmath149 substitution of yields @xmath150 at @xmath46 .",
    "note that there is no need to solve for @xmath151 in the fluid domain , where it is governed by an advection  diffusion equation .",
    "indeed , using we readily obtain @xmath152    in figure [ fig2 ] we compare the asymptotic approximation @xmath153 with the computational solution .",
    "this is done for @xmath96 and the rate - constant distribution @xmath154 , for which yields @xmath155 .",
    "the computations were performed for @xmath156 . at large @xmath2",
    "they indeed agree with the asymptotic approximation .",
    "the solute - concentration maps , shown in the insets , illustrate the transition at large @xmath2 to the radially symmetric distribution     for the fixed - rate model , with @xmath154 and @xmath96 .",

    "note the approach to a spherically symmetric distribution with increasing @xmath3 ( cf .  ) . ]",
    "we have analysed self propulsion of a chemically reactive particle for large pclet numbers . in the fixed - flux model ,",
    "the excess - solute concentration is localised in a narrow boundary layer .",
    "use of boundary - layer approximations reduces the coupled problem governing the nonlinear solute transport and fluid motion to the solution of an integral equation governing the interfacial solute concentration . in the fixed - rate model , we focused upon the limit of large swimmers or strong reaction , where the damkhler number becomes comparable to the pclet number . in that problem",
    "no boundary layer occurs , and solute advection actually diminishes with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the respective scaling of the dimensionless velocity with @xmath1 and @xmath142 implies that the velocities and , characteristic of the flow at moderate @xmath3 , are no longer representative at large @xmath3 .",
    "rather , making use of and in the fixed - flux case and and in the fixed - rate case , we find instead the respective velocity scales ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath159 representing a transition from a size - independent velocity to ones that decrease with particle size . with the generic velocity scales and being non - representative at large @xmath3 , it follows that the dimensionless number @xmath3 itself , as provided by and , does not constitute a genuine pclet number , but simply a measure of the surface activity .",
    "this is reminiscent of electrokinetic phenomena at strong applied fields @xcite or due to imposed flows @xcite , where the generic pclet number defined by ref .  @xcite",
    "no longer represents the relative magnitudes of advection and diffusion .",
    "the present work suggests two future directions .",
    "the first is a different analysis of the fixed - reaction - rate model , appropriate to the case where @xmath3 becomes large due to large solute molecules ( small @xmath12 ) . in that scenario , where @xmath2 is @xmath160 , the boundary - layer thickness is @xmath161 with an identical scaling for the velocity field ( so is satisfied ) .",
    "the boundary - layer problem is then similar to that formulated in  [ subsec : boundary - layer formulation ] , except that is replaced by an inhomogeneous robin condition .",
    "the other direction involves the case where the chemical reactions produce ions , rather than neutral species . in that case",
    "the interaction layer is the debye diffuse - charge layer .",
    "this problem is fundamentally different , as the interaction potential ( namely the electric potential ) is itself coupled to the ionic concentrations through poisson s equation .",
    "this `` auto - electrophoresis '' problem therefore falls into the realm of electrokinetics @xcite .",
    "the macroscale description of that problem , appropriate to the limit of thin double layers , was developed by ref .",
    "it differs from the macroscale description of ref .",
    "@xcite in several fundamental aspects , the important one being the need to solve for the nonlinearly - coupled transport of two fields ( ionic concentration and electric potential ) .",
    "solute advection then constitutes only one of several nonlinearities inherent in the problem .",
    "the macroscale model of ref .",
    "@xcite was solved in that paper using a linearization scheme , appropriate to the case of a nearly homogeneous particle .",
