    "the evolution of lcbgs is a matter of debate .",
    "these galaxies are unusual in their blue colors , small sizes and line - widths , yet large luminosities .",
    "we have suggested that at least a subset of these sources are the progenitors of des such as ngc 205 ( koo et al .",
    "1995 , guzman et al .",
    "1998 ) , while others counter these are bulges in formation ( hammer et al .",
    "2001 ; barton & van zee 2001 ) .",
    "surveys at intermediate redshift are not uniformly defined , and each contains heterogeneous samples  objects span a range in size , color , luminosity , surface - brightness , and image concentration .",
    "the broad `` lcbg '' class contributes as much as 45% of the comoving sfr between @xmath1 ( guzman et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the proposed de progenitors are a fraction of this class . here",
    "we focus on an extreme lcbg sub - class that are among the smallest , bluest and highest surface - brightness ( koo et al . 1995 ) : m@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 ( h@xmath5=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath6=1 , @xmath7=0.7 ) , rest - frame b - v@xmath30.25 , half - light radii of @xmath8@xmath32 kpc , mean surface - brightness within @xmath8 of @xmath319 mag / arcsec@xmath9 ( rest - frame b band ) , and integrated line - widths of @xmath10@xmath365 km / s .",
    "many of these are good candidates for de progenitors .",
    "if so , their internal kinematics should reveal they are dynamically hot , while deep imaging should show they lack outer disks .",
    "we have derived ionized - gas position  velocity and position  line - width diagrams from stis long - slit measurements along what appears to be the photometric major axes of 6 lcbgs between @xmath11 , and one other source at @xmath12 which is 2 - 3 mag lower luminosity than the others .",
    "one example is given in figure 1 .",
    "with 0.2 arcsec slits , stis delivers instrumental resolutions ( @xmath13 ) of 13 - 19 km s@xmath14 .",
    "line - emission is not always centered on the continuum ( hoyos et al .",
    "2004 ) ; the continuum centroid is adopted as the kinematic center .",
    "we find keck hires integrated line - widths ( koo et al 1995 ) agree in the mean with the resolved velocity dispersions from stis spectroscopy : integrated dispersions are not due to large - scale , bulk , motion .",
    "this secures our previous dynamical estimates of m / l and their use as constraints on photometric fading ( e.g. , guzman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "only the low-@xmath15 , low-@xmath16 system shows clear rotation and substantially different integrated versus resolved line - widths .",
    "-0.45 in -0.05 in    -0.9 in   versus ellipticity or inclination for lcbgs ( dotted stars ) , ngc 7673 ( circle / lower limit ) and early - types galaxies from simien & prugniel ( circles , dotted diamonds ) .",
    "lines represent trajectories as a function of inclination for disk - galaxies of different luminosity assuming they lie on the tully - fisher relation and @xmath17 km s@xmath14 ( andersen et al .",
    "shaded regions are adopted from kormendy & kennicutt ( 2004 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -1.6 in    -0.1 in    the lack of rotation coupled with their ellipticity squarely places these sources in the `` spheroidal '' region of the v/@xmath13 - ellipticity plane , illustrated in figure 2 . for fair comparison to local samples",
    ", ellipticities are measured at the half - light radius near rest - frame v - band from hst images ; rotation velocities are set to half the difference between minimum and maximum velocities ; and @xmath13 is the observed central velocity dispersion .",
    "while there is a range of observed v/@xmath13 , lcbgs lie well below the region inhabited by disk systems , with values comparable to local des and other spheroidals , particularly if recent observations of des with larger rotational components are considered ( pedraz et al .",
    "2002 , van zee et al .",
    "2004 ) : * lcbgs are dynamically hot*.",
    "do we know that we are nt just sampling a bulge , or a face - on nuclear star - burst ?",
    "ngc 7673 has been suggested by homeier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as a nearby example .",
    "indeed this source has the right color , surface - brightness , size , luminosity and integrated line - width , and has a faint , extended outer disk .",
    "however , homeier & gallagher s ( 1999 ) h@xmath18 velocity map shows clear evidence for rotation in the inner , star - burst region .",
    "our re - analysis confirms this : we would see similar structure _ if it existed _ in our stis spectra .",
    "independently , deep cfht imaging reveals no strong evidence for extended , normal disks around the types of ( and specific ) sources presented here ( barton et al . 2005 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the preponderance of evidence is against bulge formation in disk systems and in favor of a de - like descendant scenario _ for all of the specific sample presented here _ with m@xmath2@xmath19@xmath20 ( 6 out of 7 ) .",
    "however , the disturbed morphology and kinematics makes clean interpretations difficult . what is the gas really telling us about dynamics ?",
    "are these systems in dynamical equilibrium ? while their morphology and resolved kinematics would argue otherwise , the agreement between integrated velocity dispersions and resolved profiles indicates the systems can not be too far out of equilibrium .",
    "stellar velocity and dispersion profiles would provide a much clearer dynamical picture .",
    "finally we comment on issues raised at the conference about environment : is ngc 205 a good example of a faded , lcbg descendant ?",
    "if so , where are the m31-like neighbors ? are there field des ? if dsphs are the low - mass cousins of des , then the presence of isolated dsphs such as tucana , cetus , and the recently discovered apples 1 ( pasquali et al .",
    "2004 ) should give us pause about accepting assertions that des do not exist outside of rich environments or far from massive galaxies .",
    "the space density of lcbgs presented here is 1.25@xmath210.15@xmath22 mpc@xmath23 for m@xmath24 between @xmath25 . even allowing a factor of @xmath26 higher relic density ( given the time interval in this redshift slice and assuming",
    "the lcbg phase is a few@xmath2710@xmath28 yr ) to find even one descendant requires an all - sky local survey volume reaching out to @xmath310 mpc . at this distance",
    "the half - light radius of ngc 205 is @xmath312 arcsec .",
    "are our local surveys this complete ?"
