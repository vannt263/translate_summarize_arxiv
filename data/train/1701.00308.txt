    "moreton waves are flare - associated propagating wavelike features seen in h@xmath0 , especially in its wings @xcite .",
    "this dynamic phenomenon is directional in restricted solid angles with arc - like fronts , and propagates away from the flare site at speeds of the order of 500  1500  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite proposed the following mechanism for producing moreton waves : they are the intersection of mhd fast - mode shocks propagating in the corona with chromospheric plasma . a good correlation between h@xmath0 moreton wave and type - ii radio bursts @xcite also supports this scenario .",
    "extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) coronal waves are wavelike disturbances or expanding - dome structures observed in euv passbands in the solar corona associated with flares .",
    "they were first observed by the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and were called eit waves @xcite .",
    "although eit waves were expected to be the coronal counterpart of moreton waves , the propagating speed was much lower ( 170  350 km  s@xmath1 ) than that of moreton waves @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nature of eit waves was questioned due the discrepancies on their physical characteristics as compared to moreton waves . simultaneous observations of eit waves and h@xmath0 moreton waves @xcite show that eit wavefronts are not co - spatial with those of moreton waves . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite",

    "recently , some authors linked the euv waves with direct manifestations of cmes rather than solar flares , but the exact physical mechanism by which they are related remains unclear @xcite .    associated with flares and coronal waves , filaments and prominences at distances are sometimes activated or excited into oscillation .",

    "@xcite reported the simultaneous observation of an h@xmath0 moreton wave and a winking filament triggered by its association with a solar flare .",
    "winking filaments are more often observed for flares without moreton waves , whereas moreton waves are difficult to observe even for large flares .",
    "winking filaments , therefore , constitute indirect evidence of coronal wave traveling in the corona @xcite , which are called `` invisible '' moreton waves @xcite .",

    "we describe the data used in this study .",
    "the analysis and results are presented in section 3 , and the conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the flare in question occurred in the active region noaa 11158 ( s21@xmath2 , w30@xmath2 ) .",
    "it started at 14:19  ut and peaked at 14:25  ut on 2011 february 16 , and was classified as m1.6 on the _ goes _ scale ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "noaa 11158 produced the first x - class flare in the solar cycle 24 during the previous day .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the time evolution of the _ goes _ x - ray emission for the february 16 flare .    for the analysis we use h@xmath0 data taken by fmt that provide full - disk solar images in the h@xmath0 line center ( @xmath3   ) , h@xmath0 @xmath4    ( blue - wing ) , h@xmath0 @xmath5    ( red - wing ) , continuum , and limb prominence images ( h@xmath0 line center with occulting disk ) .",
    "the spatial resolution is about 2.0@xmath6 , and the time cadence is 20 seconds .",
    "such multiwavelength full - disk observations with high time cadence are suitable for investigating the velocity field of erupting filaments @xcite and for detecting moreton waves @xcite .",
    "fmt was relocated in march 2010 from hida observatory , kyoto university to national university san luis gonzaga of ica in peru by the international collaboration of the continuous h - alpha imaging network ( chain ) project @xcite for coordinated solar observations .",
    "we can not find any direct signatures of h@xmath0 moreton waves associated with the flare not only in the fmt images ( in h@xmath0 line center and the @xmath7   wings ) but also in their running - difference images .",
    "however , we found indirect evidence of the coronal wave in the form of winking filaments that are located far from the flare site .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows a full - disk h@xmath0 line center image of the flare taken by fmt .",
    "we show the flaring region with @xmath8 and the filaments are denoted @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the boxes indicate the areas over which we calculate the intensities to identify their winking features activated by the flare and the coronal waves .",
    "associated with the flare , we also observe a filament eruption whose shape in h@xmath0 images looks like a `` dandelion '' .",
    "this feature is especially prominent in the red- and blue - wing images .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] also presents fmt images of the flare , filament eruption , and winking filaments in h@xmath0 @xmath4   ( left ) , h@xmath0 line center ( middle ) , and h@xmath0 @xmath5   ( right ) passbands .",

    "the temporal resolution of the aia 193   data , which are attributed to a fe  xii line with the formation temperature of 1.25  mk , is 12 seconds , and the pixel size of the image is 0.60@xmath6 . at the time of the flare , _",

    "hinode_. xrt is sensitive to hot coronal plasma and can detect emissions from plasma with temperatures of the order of 1 to several tens of mk .",
    "we used partial images with 2.5@xmath6 pixel resolution through the thin - be filter .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that lies in the east - west direction is observed in soft x - rays ( see top left panel in figure  [ fig4 ] ) .    during the time of the flare ,",
    "noaa  11158 was composed of several sunspots , as discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , two neighboring fast flux emergences ( @xmath11 - @xmath12 and @xmath13 - @xmath14 pairs ) appeared in line along the east - west direction and formed a quadrupolar distribution ( see top panel of the h@xmath0 @xmath4   column in figure  [ fig5 ] ) . between the following negative spot @xmath12 of the western bipole and",
    "the preceding positive spot @xmath13 of the eastern bipole appeared a prominent filamentary structure along the magnetic neutral line on february 13 , which developed for about three days .",
    "the x - class flare on february 15 occurred along the elongated neutral line between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this basic magnetic configuration remained even after the x - class flare and displayed the sigmoid structure seen in the xrt images .",
    "the m - class flare in question , however , occurred at the eastern edge of the main neutral line between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "when the impulsive phase of the flare just begins ( @xmath1514:22  ut ) , a small bright x - ray feature appears at the eastern - end of the sigmoid structure .",
    "the brightening has counterparts in h@xmath0 and 304   images , which are mainly from footpoints of the flaring loops . as of 14:31  ut",
    ", the filament eruption can be distinguished in euv and h@xmath0 images ( see bottom panels of figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the starting point of the filament eruption is also located at the eastern edge of the neutral line between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this filament eruption is clearly discernible both in the h@xmath0 and euv images , as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "it was activated near 14:25  ut and displays an enlarging dark feature in h@xmath0 blue - wing images , like a dandelion , whereas no manifestation is exhibited in the h@xmath0 red wing until 14:32  ut .      here",
    ", we describe how we used h@xmath0 images to derive the three - dimensional velocity field of the erupting filament . for the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity , we modified the method by @xcite .",
    "they computed the los velocities of erupting filaments observed with fmt by using the method based on the beckers cloud model @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopted the single cloud model . because fmt has only three ( center and @xmath7   ) wavelength data points for the four unknowns ( source function , optical depth , doppler velocity , and doppler width ) of a cloud , they further assumed a fixed doppler width in their calculation .",
    "our method , on the other hand , deals even with the doppler width as a free parameter .",
    "this can be implemented as follows : in the quiescent phase of the filament , we derived the parameters assuming the value of the doppler width , as was done in @xcite . to analyze a time series",
    ", we search for the best - fit solution around the quiescent parameter values found in the initial time step , and select the `` nearest '' local minimum in the parameter field .",
    "this selection of the nearest values is based on the assumption that the physical parameters in a single cloud do not change so quickly .",
    "next , we search the parameters in the next time step around the parameters derived in the previous time step , and so on .",
    "we did not set a `` pre - defined range '' in our method , we used the hybrid method for the fitting @xcite .",
    "the error of the derived los velocity is roughly comparable with the errors obtained with the method of @xcite and is about @xmath1610  km  s@xmath1 , while the derived los velocity tends to be overestimated for the fixed doppler width , since the doppler width is thought to be larger for an erupting filament .",
    "the error could be , however , a little bit worse due to misalignment of the wavelengths of the fmt filters from the nominal values . comparing the wing data , the wavelength of the red wing ( @xmath5   ) seems to be set closer to the line center than that of the blue wing ( @xmath4   ) .",
    "the error of the los velocity , therefore , is roughly @xmath1615  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the left column in figure  [ fig6 ] shows the derived temporal evolution maps of the los velocity .",
    "the colors show blueshift ( i.e. , moving toward us ) and redshift ( i.e. , moving away from us ) of the filament . near 14:30  ut",
    ", the filament begins to erupt northward and simultaneously shows blueshift features , especially at the leading part , with a los velocity of about @xmath17  km  s@xmath1 . at the root of the filament , in contrast , it shows a redshift with a velocity of about 20  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the filament eruption is clearly seen until 14:35  ut . at this time , the los velocity at the leading edge is nearly @xmath18  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "next , the front edge gradually becomes invisible at 14:45  ut , whereas near 14:55  ut , the filament shows a dominant redshift pattern .",
    "the observed blueshift velocity of about @xmath17  km  s@xmath1 is slightly larger than the result by @xcite , while the temporal evolution is roughly consistent .",
    "we confirm the temporal los motion with the side views of the filament eruption observed from _ stereo - a _ , since it was located at 86.8@xmath2 ahead of the earth . in the euv 195",
    " images of _ stereo - a_/secchi / euvi , we see movement of the cold plasma as dark features ( second column in figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the dark feature is ejected from the flare site , and the traveling velocity of the front ( i.e. , the fastest ) part is about 280  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the horizontal component of the velocity ( i.e. , the velocity in the direction from the sun to the earth ) is about 230  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "fmt can not detect clouds with velocity greater than 50  km  s@xmath1 , because the wavelengths of the wing data are set at @xmath160.8   .",
    "therefore , fmt missed the front part of the ejection .    by comparing the euvi 195   and fmt h@xmath0 @xmath4   images ( figure  [ fig5 ] )",
    ", the h@xmath0 filament seems to correspond to the main ( i.e. , the darkest ) part of the filament in the 195   images .",
    "the main part of the filament has a velocity of about 110  km  s@xmath1 , and the horizontal component has a velocity of about 90  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocity is much larger than the los velocity derived by fmt ( 30  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "los velocities derived from the cloud model reflect representative values of moving clouds , and the fine los velocity field in the clouds could be lost .",
    "besides , the velocity in the earth - sun direction is derived by following dark features seen in euvi images , and is not derived by tracing the moving ejecta . alternatively , we could detect a slower component of the erupting filament , because the velocity of about 90  km  s@xmath1 far exceeds the detection limit of fmt .",
    "for the tangential velocity of the erupting filament ( that is , the velocity of the filament in the plane of the sky ) , we traced the apparent motion of filament blobs by using the local correlation tracking ( lct ) method . the middle column in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "shows the temporal evolution of the erupting filament with arrows that show the orientation and magnitude of the tangential velocity .",
    "the filament blobs are moving upward ( i.e. , northward ) with a tangential velocity of about @xmath19  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the dark feature seen in euvi 195   images has a northward velocity of about 65  km  s@xmath1 , which is faster than the tangential velocity derived from fmt .",
    "this result is explained by the excessively large mesh size used for the lct method , which means that features moving at such high speed could not be detected even if they were present .",
    "the seeing condition prevents us from reducing the mesh size for the fmt images .",
    "therefore , the derived tangential velocity is a somewhat averaged value of the main part of the ejected filament .    in the right column of figure  [ fig6 ]",
    ", we show the temporal evolution of the inclination of the ejecta .",
    "the inclination angle is set to zero for the upward direction normal to the solar surface . in the early phase of the ejection ( around 14:30  ut ) , the direction is nearly horizontal with respect to the solar surface , with a slight upward inclination . during the main phase of the ejection , which occurs around 14:35  ut , the direction is still nearly horizontal but with a slight downward inclination .",
    "next , the inclination distribution becomes complex showing upward and downward motions , probably because of the coexistence of upward and downward moving features in the later phase .",
    "although the error in the velocity measurements is probably large , we believe that the ejecta move nearly horizontally with respect to the solar surface .",
    "further , in figure  [ fig5 ] ( euvi panel at 14:30  ut ) , we depict the plane of the solar surface ( yellow arrows over the heliographic coordinates ) and a vertical component perpendicular to the surface ( arrow labeled  vertical \" ) .",
    "the dashed green arrow highlights the direction of the filament eruption as seen by _ stereo - a _ , and @xmath20 is the inclination angle with respect to the vertical on the solar surface . from euv observations ( 193   and 195   ) we infer the geometrical components of the erupting material , which led us to estimate @xmath20  @xmath21  58@xmath2 .",
    "so that , the filament in euvi was ejected having an elevation angle of about 32@xmath2 .      in the h@xmath0 data , we also observe winking ( activation and/or oscillation ) of the filaments associated with the flare . as we see in figure  [ fig2 ] ,",
    "some filaments are labeled @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "these filaments are located far from the flare site .",
    "we identify a clear winking feature for filament @xmath22 and a much fainter signature for filament @xmath10 ( see also the figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the time series of the winking filament @xmath22 is displayed in figure  [ fig7](a ) at h@xmath0 @xmath4   ( left ) , h@xmath0 center ( middle ) , and h@xmath0 @xmath5   ( right ) wavelengths .",
    "the field of view of the @xmath22 region is the same as in figure  [ fig2 ] . at 14:40  ut",
    ", the filament starts winking .",
    "first , a dark feature becomes prominent in the red - wing images , as shown by the arrow labeled @xmath23 in figure  [ fig7](a ) .",
    "the feature is dominant until 15:05  ut , and then it fades slowly away .",
    "however , at about 14:50  ut , a dark structure starts to appear in the blue - wing images , as pointed out by another arrow ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this structure is noticeable until 15:10  ut , when it disappears . in the h@xmath0 center , in contrast , no significant changes are observed .",
    "figure  [ fig7](c ) plots the temporal variations of the intensities calculated for the @xmath22 region in the three wavelengths . in the red - wing plot ( dash - dotted line ) , we clearly identify a decrease of the intensity associated with the appearance of the dark feature in the red - wing images .",
    "the decrease starts at about 14:36  ut and reaches maximal depletion around 14:45  ut , after which it recovers .",
    "the signal in the blue - wing plot ( dotted line ) , however , remains roughly constant until 14:55  ut and then starts to decrease gradually . in the h@xmath0 center plot ( solid line )",
    ", the signal slightly increases .",
    "a similar analysis for filament @xmath10 is presented in figures  [ fig7](b ) and ( d ) . unlike @xmath22",
    ", the dark structure appears mainly in the blue - wing  ( left panels ) .",
    "the dark feature is evident from 14:40  ut until 15:05  ut .",
    "conversely , at 15:00  ut , we recognize a very weak feature in the red - wing ( see arrow labeled @xmath25 in figure  [ fig7](b ) ) .",
    "the temporal variation of the intensities is plotted in figure  [ fig7](d ) .",
    "the winking feature dominates during the darkening of the blue - wing plot ( dotted line ) , whereas the red - wing ( dash - dotted line ) and h@xmath0 center ( solid line ) plots show gradual variation and no clear signals caused by filament oscillation . for the other filaments @xmath9 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27",
    ", we verified the intensity profiles and found no winking patterns .",
    "we also examine the temporal evolution of the coronal waves associated with the 2011 february 16 flare and the relation with the oscillating filaments .",
    "the time sequences of the euv waves produced by the flare are presented in the top panels of figure  [ fig8 ] ( panels a    d ) .",
    "these are the aia  193   running difference ( 20-minutes difference ) images .",
    "the white arrows highlight the moving wavefronts , whereas the locations of the oscillating filaments @xmath22 and @xmath10 are marked by the boxes .",
    "the distances of the filaments ( @xmath22 and @xmath10 ) measured from the flare site along the spherical solar surface are @xmath215.1 @xmath28 10@xmath29 and @xmath216.4 @xmath28",
    "10@xmath29  km , respectively .",
    "we derive the speeds of the euv wave by following the leading edge of wavefront consecutively along the spherical lines to the filaments @xmath22 ( path 2 ) and @xmath10 ( path 1 ) directions .",
    "the mean velocities computed from a linear fit are 430  @xmath30  29  km  s@xmath1 and 672  @xmath30  24  km  s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the euv wave have been studied by several authors @xcite , and the propagating speed ranges from 500 to 700  km  s@xmath1 , which changes depending on the propagating direction .",
    "therefore , the velocities derived in this study are comparable with those results .    at 14:28  ut ( figure  [ fig8]a ) , a well - defined wavefront propagates mainly toward the north , and a bright erupting material is observed that corresponds to the dandelion filament . at about 14:31  ut ( figure  [ fig8]b ) , the central part of the wavefront seems to stop and to exhibit a stronger amplitude : this occurs just when the wave is approaching the edges of a weak active region that is located north of noaa 11158 .",
    "the observed enhanced pattern and the changes in the wavefront progression are tentatively attributed to the compression of plasma generated by the interaction between the coronal wave and the confined magnetic system of the active region @xcite .",
    "we plot the potential magnetic field configuration derived by _",
    "soho_/mdi in figure  [ fig8](e ) .",
    "the red triangle indicates the location of the northern weak active region .",
    "we confirm that the propagating wavefront tends to stop there .",
    "note that , at 14:35  ut ( figure  [ fig8]c ) , the leading part of the wavefront decelerates , perhaps retained by the magnetic field configuration , whereas the west part is slightly refracted and continues traveling northwest ( figure  [ fig8]d ) .",
    "figure  [ fig8](f ) shows the progression of the most prominent fronts of the euv wave from 14:27 to 14:40  ut , the positions of the weak active region , and the oscillating filaments @xmath22 and @xmath10 . at 14:37  ut",
    ", the wavefront labeled 5 approaches @xmath10 and , at 14:40  ut , wavefront 6 reaches @xmath22 .",
    "these times are consistent with those identified both in the images and in the intensity plots of @xmath22 and @xmath10 ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] presents the time - distance diagram of these temporal behaviors .",
    "we measured the temporal evolution of the wavefronts along the paths , as shown by the projected dashed lines in figure  [ fig8](f ) .",
    "the squares @xmath31 and circles @xmath32 plotted together with linear fit ( dotted lines ) in figure  [ fig9 ] show the times and the positions of the wavefronts as they move along paths 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "diamonds @xmath33 indicate the oscillating filaments @xmath10 and @xmath22 , which are on straight lines , as shown by the dotted lines .",
    "therefore , the observed winking filaments are assumed to have been triggered by the passage of the euv coronal wave .",
    "we observed a filament eruption shaped like a dandelion and associated with the flare that occurred at noaa  11158 .",
    "we analyze the h@xmath0 images taken with fmt in peru and derive the three - dimensional velocity field by using a new method . to derive the los velocity , we use the modified cloud model that was originally developed for the fmt data by @xcite . we compare the temporal behavior of the erupting dandelion filament with its euv side views observed by _ stereo - a_/secchi / euvi .",
    "we realize that the los velocity derived from h@xmath0 images of fmt gives representative values of the moving clouds and that the very fast components seen in the _ stereo - a_/euvi images are probably lost due to the detection limit of fmt .",
    "the tangential velocity of the dandelion filament is derived by applying the local correlation tracking ( lct ) method to the h@xmath0 images .",
    "we derive a representative ( averaged ) tangential velocity of the main part of the filament , although we could not capture small fast - moving features , if they exist , because of the limited mesh size of the lct method . by combining these los and tangential velocities , and applying a coordinate transformation",
    ", we also derive the inclination of its velocity vectors .",
    "we confirm that the dandelion filament is ejected nearly horizontally with respect to the solar surface .",
    "we also observe the winking of h@xmath0 filaments that are located far from the flare site , and examine the relation between the winking filaments and the euv coronal wave associated with the flare .",
    "as summarized in figures  [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] , h@xmath0 filaments @xmath22 and @xmath10 start oscillating when the euv coronal wave arrives , so we confirm that the interaction between the euv wave and the h@xmath0 filaments causes the filaments to wink .",
    "the derived traveling speed of the observed euv waves is about 430 to 672  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "associated with this flare , type ii radio burst was also observed @xcite .",
    "these results are a strong indication that the observed euv waves are mhd fast - mode wave or shock .",
    "moreover , we observed the filament eruption ejected tangentially to the solar surface .",
    "this seems to be suitable to generate a h@xmath0 moreton wave , because the wavefront could easily make contact with the chromospheric plasma , even if a shock front is generated only in some restricted range at the front of the ejected filament .",
    "nevertheless , we do not observe the moreton wave associated with the flare .",
    "this is probably because the downward velocity of the wavefront is small ( about 20  km  s@xmath1 ) toward the solar surface , as reported by @xcite and @xcite , and probably because the euv coronal wave ( or shock ) is not strong enough to generate an observable moreton wave in the h@xmath0 band .",
    "we derived the three - dimensional velocity field of the filament eruption .",
    "we could follow the temporal evolutions of the velocity field and inclination of the ejecta .",
    "we also examined the temporal behaviors of the euv waves associated with the filament eruption .",
    "these provide us an overall picture on the development of the euv coronal wave and a filament ejection .",
    "although fmt may have missed to capture very fast components the close correlations in time and main direction of the euv wave progression with those of the filament eruption , leads us to conclude that the filament is the driver of the observed euv wave . although the work we did by measuring the three - dimensional velocity fields of erupting filament and examining the relation between velocity fields and coronal euv wave have shown a direct link among both phenomena , further studies are needed to fully understand filament eruptions as a driver of coronal euv waves and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "statistical studies to derive the tendency of filament eruptions to generate coronal waves and/or cmes could be useful for this .",

    "<S> coronal disturbances associated with solar flares , such as h@xmath0 moreton waves , x - ray waves , and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) coronal waves are discussed herein in relation to magnetohydrodynamics fast - mode waves or shocks in the corona . to understand the mechanism of coronal disturbances , full - disk solar observations with high spatial and temporal resolution over multiple wavelengths are of crucial importance . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a filament eruption , whose shape is like a `` dandelion '' , associated with the m1.6 flare that occurred on 2011 february 16 in the h@xmath0 images taken by the flare monitoring telescope at ica university , peru . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the three - dimensional velocity field of the erupting filament . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify winking filaments that are located far from the flare site in the h@xmath0 images , whereas no moreton wave is observed . by comparing the temporal evolution of the winking filaments with those of the coronal wave seen in the extreme ultraviolet images data taken by the atmospheric imaging assembly on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _ and by the extreme ultraviolet imager on board the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory - ahead _ , we confirm that the winking filaments were activated by the euv coronal wave . </S>"
