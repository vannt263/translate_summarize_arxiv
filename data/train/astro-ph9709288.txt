    "many low - mass stars form in multiple systems ( cf .",
    "ghez et  al.1993 ) , either through capture , fragmentation of the collapsing core , or condensation from the primary s disk ( e.g. , bodenheimer , ruzmaikina & mathieu 1993 ) .",
    "the presence of a close companion must influence the evolution of the star and the possible development of an accretion disk ( e.g. , jensen et  al.1996 ) .",
    "observations of the distribution of the bulk of the gas and dust in young and forming multiple systems are needed to better understand their evolution , which may be very different from that of a single star .",
    "this letter presents high resolution continuum and spectral line observations of one such close multiple system : t  tauri .    a prototypical low - mass young stellar object ( yso ) , t  tau is a 07 separation binary ( projected distance of 100  au at 140  pc ) , consisting of an optically visible star , t  tau  n , and an infrared companion , t  tau  s ( dyck , simon & zuckerman 1982 ) .",
    "ray et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) report the presence at @xmath11 cm of a third source , possibly a star , t  tau  r. the system is surrounded by 0.03 to 0.3  @xmath9 of gas and dust distributed on 3000 to @xmath12  au scales ( e.g. , schuster , harris & russell 1997 ; hogerheijde et  al.1997 ) .",
    "both stars appear to drive outflows , at least one of which is directed close to the line of sight ( edwards & snell 1982 , beckwith et  al .  1978 ;",
    "van  langevelde et  al .  1994 ; herbst et  al.1997 ) .",
    "stellar light curves indicate that the rotation axis of t  tau",
    "n is inclined by only @xmath13 ( herbst et  al .",
    "1997 ) . from the strength and variability of its free - free radio emission , t  tau  s appears to be a more active outflow source than t  tau  n ( skinner & brown 1994 ; ray et  al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the infrared nature and activity of t  tau  s have been explained in a number of ways : through obscuration by a remnant protostellar envelope surrounding t  tau  s ( dyck et  al .  1982 ) or around the binary system ( calvet et  al .",
    "1994 ) , or through obscuration caused by periodic perturbation of circumstellar material in the binary orbit ( koresko , herbst & leinert 1997 ) . until recently ,",
    "the t  tau binary has only been resolved at centimeter and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "all information on the gas and dust in the system has been derived from ( sub-)millimeter and far - infrared measurements , which did not separate the pair . in this letter we present sub - arcsecond resolution 267 and 357  ghz continuum observations showing that the compact dust emission from the system is confined to the surroundings of t  tau  n ( see also van  langevelde et  al .",
    "in addition , 04 resolution imaging confirms that t  tau  s is brighter than t  tau  n at @xmath2=4  @xmath3 m .",
    "the spatially resolved ( sub-)millimeter fluxes , and literature values for centimeter and infrared observations , allow a fit to the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the individual sources , constraining the mass and size of the disk around t  tau  n and the circumstellar material around t  tau  s.",
    "continuum emission at 267  ghz and hco@xmath0 @xmath1=32 line emission were imaged with the millimeter array at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) on 1994 , december  1 .",
    "baselines between 20 and 200  k@xmath2 were sampled , resulting in a @xmath14 synthesized beam for a robust weighting of + 1 .",
    "the continuum data were integrated over a 1  ghz band width , yielding a @xmath15 rms noise level of 30  @xmath16 .",
    "the hco@xmath0 32 data were recorded in a 64 channel correlator with a resolution of 0.5  mhz or 0.56  @xmath17 ; the @xmath15 rms noise in a channel is 1.3  @xmath18 , or 19  @xmath19 for natural weighting .",
    "the antenna - based complex gains of the ovro instrument were derived with the mma package , using pks  0528 + 134 as the phase calibrator and 3c  454.3 as the flux calibrator , for which a flux of 6.50  jy was derived from observations of planets .",
    "the data were mapped and analyzed with the miriad software package . like the radio positions of t  tau  n and s , the coordinates of the 267  ghz emission are tied to the radio reference frame ; the estimated uncertainty in the absolute positions of 02 is dominated by the accuracy of the array baselines .    the 357  ghz continuum emission",
    "was observed together with hco@xmath0 43 line emission using the single - baseline interferometer ( sbi ) of the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , on 1994 , october  28 .",
    "projected baselines ranged between 140 and 195  k@xmath2 , resulting in an effective resolution of @xmath20 .",
    "the data were recorded in a 500  mhz wide band with 400 channels , and vector - averaged over 100  second intervals .",
    "the gain of the instrument was @xmath21  @xmath22 , derived from pks  0528 + 134 .",
    "since the phase variations on the jcmt  cso baseline can not be tracked , only the 100  s vector - averaged visibility amplitudes are used ( cf .  lay et  al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "imaging at @xmath2=4  @xmath3 m was acquired with the w.  m.  keck telescope on 1997 , february  7 , using the near infrared camera and br@xmath23continuum filter ( 3.974.02  @xmath3 m ) .",
    "the detector array has 015 pixels .",
    "the final image contains 2000 integrations of 45  milliseconds each .",
    "atmospheric conditions were good , with a seeing of 0304 .",
    "the image was processed with the iraf package .",
    "the 267  ghz continuum emission , shown in fig .",
    "1a , is unresolved with a peak flux of @xmath24  @xmath16 .",
    "a point - source fit to the visibilities yields a flux of @xmath4  mjy , and a position within 1@xmath25 ( 02 ) of both t  tau  n and t  tau  r ( table  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 upper limit on the flux toward t  tau  s is 100  mjy .",
    "although t  tau  r , at 013 , is slightly closer to the continuum peak than t  tau  n ( 020 ) , we attribute the 267  ghz emission to t  tau  n , due to the uncertain nature of t  tau  r. based on the compactness of the source and the emission at infrared and sub - millimeter wavelengths ( herbst et  al .",
    "1997 ; beckwith et  al .",
    "1990 ) , we interpret the 267 ghz emission as arising from a disk of radius @xmath27  au around the optical star .    the @xmath2=4  @xmath3 m keck image of the t  tau system is shown in fig .",
    "1b in grey scale , with contours of the 267  ghz emission superposed .",
    "the binary is clearly resolved and is consistent with two individual point sources .",
    "the 4  @xmath3 m flux from t  tau  s is 1.5 times that from t  tau  n. no absolute positional information is available for the keck data , so the image has been aligned with the radio positions of t  tau .",
    "the binary separation at 4  @xmath3 m is 070 , consistent with measurements at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "no evidence is found for emission from t  tau  r.    the 357  ghz continuum sbi data are consistent with emission from a single point source and yield a vector - averaged flux of @xmath28 mjy , where the uncertainty is dominated by the flux calibration . the observed emission at 267 and 357  ghz accounts for 60%80% of the single - dish fluxes at these wavelengths on @xmath29 and @xmath30 scales , respectively ( moriarty - schieven et  al.1994 ) .",

    "emission in the hco@xmath0 32 line is detected only on baselines @xmath32  k@xmath2 , and over 311  @xmath33 . the naturally weighted image ( fig .",
    "1c ) shows a @xmath34 core , centered between t  tau  n and s , with a peak flux of @xmath35  @xmath36 or 745  @xmath19 .",
    "this is 25% of the @xmath29 single - dish line flux , comparable to the 10% recovered at hco@xmath0 10 by ovro ( hogerheijde et  al .",
    "no emission from hco@xmath0 43 was detected in the sbi data with a statistical upper limit of @xmath37  jy , or @xmath38  k , for a @xmath39 source size , consistent with the non - detection of hco@xmath0 32 emission on baselines @xmath40  k@xmath2 .",
    "our observations of 267  ghz continuum emission show that most of the material on 100  au scales is associated with t  tau  n , most likely in a disk .",
    "although the near - infrared sed of t  tau  s also indicates the presence of a disk , the 267  ghz upper limit strictly constrains the mass .",
    "bate & bonnell ( 1997 ) found that material infalling toward a binary system preferably forms a disk around the more massive primary , which our observations show to be t  tau  n. how does the difference in disk mass for t  tau  n and s impact our understanding of the t  tau system , especially the obscured , infrared nature of t  tau  s ?",
    "of the many scenarios which have been proposed to explain the infrared nature of t  tau  s ( see  1 ) , that of dynamical interaction is particularly interesting because it links the obscuration of infrared companions in binary systems with their observed variability ( koresko et  al .",
    "1997 ) . based on our new data for t  tau",
    ", we propose a variation on this model , wherein t  tau  s is obscured directly by the disk around t  tau  n. this requires the disk to extend to @xmath41  au , at a modest inclination with respect to the binary orbital plane .",
    "for the assumed dust properties ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ; their model ` thin 6 ' ) , a surface density of 0.12  @xmath42 is required to obscure an assumed stellar photosphere for t  tau  s of @xmath43  k.    to further investigate this model and derive mass estimates for the disks around t  tau  n and s , and for the circumbinary envelope , a fit to the sed between 21  cm and 1.22  @xmath3 m is constructed ( fig .  2 ) . the model for t  tau  n is based on a stellar photosphere of 5250  k ( k0 star ) , and a temperature distribution in the disk characterized by a radial power law with index @xmath44 with an intrinsic luminosity @xmath45 ( adams , lada & shu 1987 ; eq .  [ a22 ] ) . from the optically thick 1.22 to 20 @xmath3 m range , estimates are obtained of the stellar radius , @xmath46 @xmath47 , the inner radius of the disk , @xmath48 @xmath47 , the disk luminosity , @xmath49 @xmath50 , and the index , @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "herbst et  al.1997 ) .    at longer wavelengths , where the disk is largely optically thin",
    ", the surface density is important .",
    "the density distribution depends on angular momentum transport processes like viscosity and disk wind ( cf .",
    "adams & lin 1993 ) . the gravitational interaction with the binary companion",
    "is expected to truncate the disk at some radius ( cf .",
    "lin & papaloizou 1993 ) .",
    "the surface density is approximated here by a radial power law @xmath52 , which is truncated at radii @xmath53 by an exponential taper , @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "it is found that this exponential fall - off is required to permit the low surface density of 0.12 g  @xmath55 needed for the obscuration of t  tau  s while and still fitting the flux of t  tau  n. the exact functional form of the truncation or the adopted outer radius is not important for the derived masses for @xmath56 au .",
    "assuming @xmath57 au , the only free model parameter left is the @xmath58 radius @xmath59 .",
    "the 267  ghz flux constrains @xmath59 to 78 au , with a corresponding disk mass of @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the sed of t  tau  s is fitted with the same model and parameters , plus obscuration by the disk of t  tau  n. the only differences are the disk mass , along with the luminosity of 15  @xmath50 and index of q=0.54 required to fit the higher infrared fluxes .",
    "an interstellar extinction of a@xmath60=1.44  mag is applied to the whole system ( cohen & kuhi 1979 ) , and free - free spectral indices of 0.6 and 0.2 are used for t  tau  n and s , respectively . the assumed stellar temperature is unimportant since the disk luminosity dominates the sed at @xmath61 @xmath3 m .",
    "the disk mass is constrained by the 20  @xmath3 m flux and the 267  ghz upper limit to lie between @xmath62  @xmath9 .",
    "to fit the unresolved ( sub-)millimeter and infrared observations , a circumbinary envelope of 0.0050.03  @xmath9 is also required , depending on the disk mass of t  tau  s. this envelope is modeled with a power law for the density with slope @xmath63 , and for the temperature with slope @xmath64 . at the inner radius of 100  au , a temperature of 63  k provides a good fit to the peak of the sed .",
    "an outer radius of 3000  au is used , corresponding to the typical beam size of the ( sub-)millimeter observations .",
    "the presence of this power - law envelope is consistent with the non - detection of extended 267  ghz continuum emission on 16200 k@xmath2 baselines at the obtained noise level .",
    "the hco@xmath0 32 emission on 1670 k@xmath2 baselines can be explained by the sensitivity of this line to density , which results in a more peaked brightness distribution , although additional emission from , e.g. , material in the walls of the outflow cavity ( cf .",
    "hogerheijde et  al .",
    "1998 ) is required to fit its absolute flux .",
    "the non - detection of hco@xmath0 32 on baselines",
    "@xmath40  k@xmath2 with an upper limit of @xmath65  @xmath36 , or @xmath66  @xmath67 , sets a rough upper limit to the hco@xmath0 abundance in the disk .",
    "assuming an excitation temperature of 60  k and neglecting any optical depth effects , an upper limit to the abundance of @xmath68 is found .",
    "the limit placed on the amount of circumstellar material around t  tau  s by our 267  ghz measurements places constraints on the nature of the obscuration . while a small edge - on disk around t  tau  s could provide the observed extinction , the disk around t  tau  n is a more likely candidate .",
    "in either case , it is implied that the binary orbit and the respective disks are not coplanar . a circumstellar envelope around t",
    "tau  s alone is unlikely as obscuring agent , since it implies that either the current projected binary separation is a chance close projection , or that the envelope is @xmath69  au and hence dynamically short - lived .",
    "an envelope around both t  tau  n and s requires a special geometry which allows t  tau  n to suffer little extinction while heavily obscuring t  tau  s.    to test the hypothesis that t  tau  n s disk is obscuring t  tau  s , sub - arcsecond resolution observations at sub - millimeter wavelengths and at 1020  @xmath3 m are needed to place firmer limits on the distribution of the circumstellar material around t  tau  s. for example , monitoring of the near - infrared variability and the shape of the 10  @xmath3 m silicate absorption could distinguish intrinsic variations in t  tau  s from inhomogeneities in the obscuring disk or changes in the star  disk geometry .",
    "observation of the 20200  @xmath3 m spectrum planned for the _ infrared space observatory _ will help to further constrain the sed model , since the emission from the disks and the envelope peak at these wavelengths .",
    "some of the other infrared companions to t  tauri  stars might be explained by disk obscuration as well ( e.g. , haro  610 at 12 separation , leinert & haas 1989 ; xz  tau at 03 , haas et al.1990 ; uy  aur at 09 , herbst et al.1995 ) .",
    "millimeter observations at sub - arcsecond resolution are needed to determine the material distributions in these systems .",
    "the authors wish to thank o.  lay for a critical reading of the manuscript , and him and j.  carlstrom for assistance in the observation and reduction of the sbi data .",
