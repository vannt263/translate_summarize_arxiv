    "in recent years , there have been increasing interests in the study of low - dimensional metallic nanostructures because of their unique physical properties and the potential applications in nanoscale materials and devices @xcite .",
    "the progress in experimental techniques have made it possible to synthesize stable ultrathin metal nanowires with diameter down to several nanometers and of sufficient length @xcite .",
    "for example , kim s group has successfully fabricated arrays of single - crystalline silver nanowires with 0.4 nm width and @xmath1m - scale length inside the pores of organic template @xcite .",
    "_ has observed novel helical multi - shell structures in the suspended ultrathin gold and platinum nanowires @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the ultrathin metal wires have been investigated by different groups @xcite .",
    "most of those previous studies were focused on their structures , melting and dynamical behavior @xcite , while there are only few _ ab initio _",
    "@xcite or semiempircal @xcite calculations on the electronic properties of metal nanowires .",
    "so far , our knowledge on the electronic and magnetic properties of metal nanowires are still quite limited .",
    "in particular , there is no theoretical exploration on the electronic and magnetic properties of ultrathin bimetallic nanowires , whereas the bimetallic nanoclusters have been studies in previous works @xcite .    in this paper , we exploit the structural and magnetic properties of co nanowires fully coated with cu atomic shells .",
    "the main reason for choosing cu - co system is that the physical properties of bulk co and cu are very different while their atomic radiuses are comparable .",
    "we may get a clear dependence of the various properties of the coated nanowires on their size , structure , and thickness of cu and co layers .",
    "moreover , co and cu alloys are non - miscible .",
    "the detailed study of cu - co alloy nanowires might provide a qualitative analysis from the mecoscopical points .",
    "previously , the magnetic properties of both free co clusters @xcite and the co clusters embedded in cu matrix have been studied @xcite .",
    "the interatomic interactions are modeled by a gupta - like many - body potential @xcite , which was widely used to study the structures and properties of small transition metal clusters @xcite and alloy clusters @xcite .",
    "the potential parameters for co - co and cu - cu interaction are taken according to those fitted for bulk co and cu solids in @xcite .",
    "the parameters for inhomogeneous cu - co interaction are derived from the average of the cu - cu and co - co parameters . in our previous works",
    "@xcite , the validity of this parameterization scheme was examined by comparing with _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on the small clusters , i.e. , homogeneous and inhomogeneous dimers and trimers , co@xmath2 and cu@xmath2 .",
    "a direct comparison of the _ ab initio _ result with the empirical one on the structural information , such as equilibrium bond length and bond angle of the small clusters , can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "this parameterization has successfully described the structural electronic , magnetic and thermal properties of co@xmath3cu@xmath4(@xmath5 clusters@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the lowest energy structures of the cu - coated co nanowires in several specific stoichiometric compositions are determined using a genetic algorithm ( ga ) @xcite global structural minimization . in breif ,",
    "a number of random initial configurations of the nanowires within one - dimensional periodic boundary condition are generated in the beginning .",
    "any two candidates in the population are then chosen as parents to generate a child cluster by mating operation @xcite .",
    "the child nanowire structure is further relaxed using empirical molecular dynamics .",
    "then the optimized structure will be selected to replace its parents if it has lower energy .",
    "the detailed description of the genetic algorithm in the structural optimization of low - dimensional nanostructures can be found in our previous publications @xcite .    from our simulations , we found that the cu - co alloy nanowire tend to form ordered structures .",
    "cu atoms prefer to occupy the surface while co atoms stay in the interior of wire .",
    "the assembling of cu atoms tends to maximize the number of cu - cu and co - co bonds .",
    "this phenomenon can be attributed to the significant difference in the surface energy and the cohesive energy between co and cu .",
    "the cohesive energy and surface energy of the bulk cu solid are 3.544 ev per atom and 1.934 jm@xmath6 respectively .",
    "both are smaller than those of the co solid , 4.386 ev and 2.709 jm@xmath6 .",
    "to minimize the total energy , the atom with a smaller surface energy and cohesive energy tends to occupy the surface , while the atom with a higher surface energy and cohesive energy favors to stay in the interior .",
    "another possible reason is the atomic size effect . in our simulations ,",
    "the first neighboring distance of cu is 2.556  , larger than that of co ( 2.507  ) .",
    "thus , co atoms are more easily surrounded by cu atoms . basing on these effects",
    ", we can adjust the composition ratios of cu and co to achieve some perfect - coated structures , for which their electronic and magnetic properties are studied .",
    "multi - shell cylindrical structures are typically found for the cu - co alloy nanowires in our ga simulations .",
    "these structures are multi - shell central cylinders composed of regular coaxial cylindrical shells .",
    "such structures have been theoretically predicted for al , pb , au , ti , zr , rh , cu nanowires @xcite and experimentally observed in au and pt nanowires @xcite . on the other hand , coaxial nanocable by semiconducting materials were reported by iijima s group @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we restrict our discussions on those nanowires belonging to the centered pentagonal and hexagonal multishell growth sequence because of their relatively higher symmetry and thermal stability @xcite . our systematical illustration of various multishell growth sequence of the metal nanowires can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "= 5.15 in    2    fig.1 shows the morphologies of the cu - co alloy nanowires with centered pentagonal and hexagonal multishell sequence .",
    "both the bare co nanowire and the co wires perfectly coated with cu are presented . with the notation of @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath9-@xmath10 in parenthesis @xcite",
    ", we can describe the nanowires consisting of closed coaxial shells , each of which is composed of @xmath11 , and @xmath10 helical atomic strands from outer to inner ( @xmath12)@xcite . as shown in fig.1 , wire cu(6)co(1 ) is formed by the outer shell containing six cu helical atomic strands and the inner shell being a single row of co atoms .",
    "similarly , wires cu(12 - 6)co(1 ) , co(6 - 1 ) , cu(12)co(6 - 1 ) , cu(17 - 12)co(6 - 1 ) , co(12 - 6 - 1 ) , and cu(17)co(12 - 6 - 1 ) constitute growth patterns with two- , three- , and four - shells sequence of centered hexagonal packing .",
    "in contrast to the helical structures found in the centered hexagonal growth pattern , the cu(5)co(1 ) , cu(10 - 5)co(1 ) , co(5 - 1 ) , cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) , cu(15 - 10)co(5 - 1 ) , co(10 - 5 - 1 ) , and cu(15)co(10 - 5 - 1 ) nanowires associated with the centered pentagonal multishell sequence are not helical .",
    "these structures can be viewed as deformed icosahedral packing .",
    "based on the optimized structures in fig.1 , we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties by a parameterized @xmath0 tight - binding model hamiltonian within the unrestricted hartee - fock approximation .",
    "similar tight - binding methods were successfully applied to transition - metal clusters @xcite and nanowires @xcite in our previous works .",
    "the hamiltonian , written in a local orbital basic set , has the expression : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath16is the number operator of an electron .. the @xmath17is the hopping integral between different sites and orbitals .",

    "@xmath27 denotes the charge change .",
    "the coulomb interaction @xmath28 is described as @xmath29    during our calculations , the orbital energy and the hopping integrals are taken to be the bulk values obtained from andersen s linear muffin - tin orbital atomic sphere approximation ( lmto - asa ) paramagnetic bands@xcite .",
    "the hopping integrals are assumed to be spin independent and are averaged for the heteronuclear . exchanging integrals other than @xmath30",

    "the @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath9-@xmath10-@xmath39 structural indexes for these wires are given in parenthesis .",
    "to simplify the discussion , we will divide the @xmath40 atoms in the simulation supercell of nanowire into several groups based on the atomic layers , coordination numbers and symmetries of the wire and take their average ( see table ii ) .",
    "for example , there are two group of atomic sites ( i.e. , centered single atom - row and outer shell ) in co(5 - 1 ) , cu(5)co(1 ) , co(6 - 1 ) , and cu(6)co(1 ) wires , and four in cu(10 - 5)co(1 ) , cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) , cu(12 - 6)co(1 ) , and cu(12)co(6 - 1 ) .",
    "table i. the average coordination numbers ( cn ) , average bond length r( ) , calculated average magnetic moments per co ( @xmath41 ) and cu ( @xmath42 ) atom ( in unit of @xmath43 ) for cu - co nanowires .",
    "the structural index @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath9-@xmath10-@xmath39 for these wires is given in parenthesis .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     2    in the case of single cu layer coating , co nanowires are still magnetic with reduced moments as compared with the corresponding bare ones ( see table i ) , with exception at cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) wire .",
    "the average magnetic moment per co atom in wire cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) is much larger than one of co(5 - 1 ) .",
    "the reason might be that cu layer",
    " compresses  the bond length of co - co in the co wire , which lead to the larger charge transfer between cu and co atoms .",
    "we find the average bond length of the core co(5 - 1 ) wire is 2.516  , which is smaller than that 2.527  of bare co(5 - 1 ) wire . in most cases ,",
    "the average magnetic moment of cu atom is nearly zero , whereas small moments on cu sites are found in the cu(6)co(1 ) , cu(5)co(1 ) , cu(10 - 5)co(1 ) , and cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) wires .    to further explore the interaction between co core and coated cu layers , table ii present the mulliken populations for several bare and cu - coated co nanowires .",
    "considerable charge transfer is found in all the nanowire studied .",
    "since the electronegativity for cu is close to that for co , it is expected that electrons may transfer either from co to cu or from cu to co , depending upon the specific structure and environment of the atoms .",
    "we find that the charge transfer from cu atoms to co atoms occurs for the single atomic co row with cu coating , while the charge transfer from co atoms to cu atoms is found for the other nanowires . from table ii",
    ", electrons are found to transfer from cu layers to co row in the cu(5)co(1 ) , cu(10 - 5)co(1 ) , and cu(12 - 6)co(1 ) .",
    "but for the nanowires cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) , cu(12)co(6 - 1 ) , and cu(17 - 12)co(6 - 1 ) there are electrons transferring from co to cu .",
    "generally , charge transfer from cu to co will depress the magnetic moment of co atom . on the contrary , when the charge transfers from co to cu , an enhanced magnetism of co will be induced .",
    "for example , it is found that the central co row of nanowires has an enhanced moment when covered with cu shell , such as cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) and cu(12)co(6 - 1 ) .",
    "charge transfer between co atoms is also found for the bare co nanowires , for example , co(12 - 6 - 1 ) in table ii , where electrons transfer to the high - coordinate sites .",
    "the transfer is related to a corrugated outmost shell with shorter bond lengths .",
    "in addition , there is also considerable charge redistribution between different shells of co atoms and among different atomic orbitals of the same atom in all nanowires with coating cu shells . for co atoms ,",
    "the charges are transferred from @xmath44 orbitals to @xmath45 orbital , while for cu atoms , the charges are transferred from @xmath45 orbital to @xmath44 orbitals .",
    "fig.2 shows the total density of states ( dos ) and the @xmath44 , @xmath45 partial dos of several bare and coated co nanowires . in general , the dos near to fermi level plays a primary role in determining the magnetism of the nanowires .",
    "it is clearly seen that the contribution from @xmath45 electrons is dominant , while the @xmath44 components are less important .",
    "the contribution of @xmath45 electrons in cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) is larger than that in co(5 - 1 ) , which leads to the enhanced magnetic moment in cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) wire . for cu(10 - 5)co(1 ) and cu(12 - 6)co(1 ) wires , the contribution of @xmath45 electrons near to the fermi level is relatively smaller than that of other cases , which leads to especially low magnetic moments .",
    "moreover , fig.2 shows that the @xmath44-@xmath45 hybridizations in cu(10 - 5)co(1 ) and cu(12 - 6)co(1 ) wires are also less pronounced than other cases , while the hybridizations is much pronounced in cu(10)co(5 - 1 ) and cu(12)co(6 - 1 ) wires .",
    "this @xmath44-@xmath45 hybridizations also enhances the magnetism of these cu - co alloy nanowires .",
    "the calculated dos s for the cu - co nanowires show some similarity to those of cu - co alloy clusters in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in summary , the geometrical and magnetic properties of bimetallic co nanowires coated with cu have been studied by a genetic algorithm with a gupta - like many - body potential and a spin polarized tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the main conclusions can be made as follows . in the specific stoichiometric compositions ,",
    "cu atoms occupy the surface , while co atoms prefer to occupy the interior of the nanowires to form the perfect - coated structures .",
    "the coated cu atomic layer leads to large variations of the magnetic moment of co nanowires , depending on the structure and the thickness of cu layers .",
    "single co atom row in the center of nanowire is found to be nonmagnetic when coated with two cu layers , while all the rest co nanowires coated with cu shell are still magnetic and their moments are reduced .                                                                                                                            o. k. andersen and o. jepsen , phys.rev.lett.*53 * , 2471(1984 ) ; o.k.andersen and o.jepsen and d.gloetzel , in _ highlights of condensed matter theory _ , editor by f. bassani , f.fumi , and m. tosi ( north - holland , amsterdam , 1985 ) ."
