    "topological insulator ( ti ) is a novel actively developing field of the solid state physics ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main property of ti is topological protection of the edge states that is the spin conservation together with the direction of propagation . as a consequence",
    ", the nonlocal transport appears and the conductance at zero temperature is quantized .",
    "the topological protection ( tp ) is rigorous consequence of the time reversibility . in mathematical formulation",
    "single - electron elastic backscattering processes are forbidden due to conservation of @xmath0 topological index in the systems with odd number of edges @xcite , in particular in the case of a single edge .",
    "the single - edge states stay robust against not only elastic scattering but against the inelastic phonon scattering @xcite both for non - interacting electrons and for tomonaga - luttiger liquid . on the contrary",
    ", the inclusion of the random rashba spin - orbit coupling together with the e - e interaction opens the backscattering channel in intraedge e - e scattering @xcite .",
    "the intraedge e - e backscattering also appears due to k - dependent rashba interaction @xcite .",
    "another variant of non - magnetic intraedge backscattering is two - particle impurity scattering @xcite . in macroscopic 2d ti",
    "the backscattering appears with participation of electron puddles inside the sample @xcite .",
    "all these inelastic processes manifest themselves at finite temperature . however , the elastic transitions between contra - propagating states can occur if the system possesses multiple edges ( at least two on the different sides of the strip ) , e.g. in the region of the strip constriction owing to non - adiabatic tunneling @xcite .    in wide enough strips the elastic interedge backscattering processes are weak . however , they exist due to disorder . till",
    "now there are no papers considering the disorder - induced interedge transitions .",
    "the experimental evidence of the edge ( and quantized ) character of the transport in macroscopic hgte quantum wells was presented in @xcite .",
    "the destruction of the quantized conductance by a weak magnetic field shows that these properties are clearly connected with the time reversibility .",
    "the experiments on the local and non - local conductance of 2d hgte ti have been done recently by @xcite .",
    "the authors demonstrate that the backscattering length in ti achieves macroscopic values up to 1 mm . at the same time authors consider that the violation of the topological protection can be caused by the spin - flip processes .",
    "in the present paper we study the free - electron inter - edge backscattering in a narrow 2d ti strip caused by non - magnetic impurities , edge imperfectness and phonons and the influence of the backscattering on the conductivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we find the electron states in a clean strip .",
    "then , we consider the scattering of the edge electrons .",
    "we will use two approaches to the problem .",
    "firstly , we will study the problem in the framework of the kinetic equation .",
    "the contra - propagating edge states are assumed as basic states for the kinetic equation .",
    "the backscattering mean free time determines the conductivity of the infinitely long system .",
    "we examined the backscattering mechanisms caused by the impurities , the border imperfectness and phonons .",
    "then we studied the non - local 4-terminal resistance of the ti strip .",
    "the kinetic equation approach is valid if the phase coherence between collisions are destroyed",
    ". the limitation of the validity of the kinetic approach due to dephasing intraedge forward scattering is found . at low temperature",
    "the other approach based directly on the single - electron schrdinger equation in a disordered system is needed .",
    "basing on this approach we numerically calculate the conductance using the probability of transmission through the finite - length strip . and after that we discuss the results .",
    "we will neglect the e - e interaction that is justifiable if the e - e interaction constant is small .",
    "the considered system is a strip of 2d ti from cdte / hgte / cdte quantum well ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the strip in @xmath1 plane is determined by inequalities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",

    "strong enough decoherence revives the kinetic equation applicability .    unlike the impurities",
    ", the phonons do not conserve the phase coherence .",
    "below we consider the scattering of electrons by phonons .",
    "note that at large enough temperature , the phonon backscattering can be considered in the same way as the impurity scattering by neglecting the emitted phonon frequency as compared with the temperature .",

    "it is assumed that electrons interact by the deformation potential with the bulk longitudinal acoustic phonons only ; the difference between hgte and cdte elastic constants and deformation potentials is neglected .",
    "similar to eq.([wimp ] ) we have found the interedge ( @xmath154 ) transition probability caused by the phonons . as a result , instead of eq.([tauimp ] ) we have for the backscattering time @xmath155 the integral in eq.([tauph11 ] ) has the order of the inverse quantum well width @xmath156 .",
    "( it should be noted that in contrast to the impurity scattering the scattering due to phonons demanded accounting for the transversal ( i.e. along @xmath157 ) structure of the edge state . ) in deducing eq.([tauph11 ] ) we have utilize the condition that the temperature @xmath158 is much larger than the characteristic frequency of emitted phonons @xmath159 .",
    "the phonon backscattering grows with the temperature and has the same smallness caused by the overlapping of edge states as the impurity scattering .",
    "note that the electron - phonon scattering rate eq.([tauph11 ] ) can be found by replacement the total number of impurities by the phonon distribution function and corresponding replacement of the interaction constant .",
    "for conductivity one should collect the relaxation rates caused by impurities , edges and phonons together .    now go to the forward phonon - induced scattering @xmath160 .",
    "this process being essentially stronger than the backscattering conserves the electron velocity and hence does not affect the kinetics .",
    "the role of the forward scattering is to control the phase coherence in the system , namely electron dephasing time @xmath161 .",
    "electrons propagating along an isolated edge obtain random phases due to the phonon field . here",
    "we will discuss the phonon mechanism in the low - temperature limit when the frequency of emitted / absorbed phonons has the order of electron thermal energy @xmath158 ( in other words , the process is inelastic ) and , hence , @xmath162 coincides with the inelastic forward relaxation time .. strong dephasing , however , suppresses the off - diagonal elements of this matrix . as a result , the diagonal elements of the density matrix become larger than off - diagonal elements ; that revives the classical kinetic equation .",
    "] noting , that the main contribution to @xmath162 arises from the forward scattering , we find @xmath163 here @xmath164 is the bose - einstein distribution function . using the relations @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , we obtain at @xmath169 @xmath170 .",

    "( [ tau - phi24 ] ) , in fact , gives the mean free time of inelastic forward scattering which is reasonable estimation for @xmath162 .",
    "one can see that at low temperature @xmath162 grows @xmath180 , but do not contain an exponentially large factor caused by the wave function overlapping .",
    "the validity of the kinetic regime needs @xmath181 , _ vice versa _ the localization occurs if @xmath182 ; the transition between these regimes occurs when @xmath183 , where @xmath82 in the low - temperature limit does not depend on @xmath158 .",
    "more detailed consideration goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the currents in the ti are localized near the strip edges .",
    "the edge states determine one - dimensional `` quantum wires '' , hence the conductance has non - local character .",
    "the nonlocality of the transport means that the voltage applied to a close pair of contacts ( for example , contacts 1 and 2 in the fig .",
    "1 ) penetrates to the distance much larger than the distance between them .",
    "let us consider the non - local conductance at finite temperatures within the framework of the kinetic equation . instead of solving the problem of conductivity we will deal with the diffusion keeping in mind the einstein relation between the conductivity and diffusion coefficient .",
    "let an infinite strip has 4 contacts ( see fig.1 ) located at points @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 .",
    "we assume that the contacts 1 and 2 are current contacts and contacts 3 and 4 are potentiometric .    the application of the voltage between contacts 1 and 2 can be interpreted as difference between chemical potentials of emitted ( absorbed ) electrons @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the equations for the distribution functions read @xmath191 the boundary conditions are @xmath192 , @xmath193 .    solving the equations we find the current @xmath194 and the potential between the edges in the distance @xmath21 from the current contacts : @xmath195 .",

    "exponentially large value of @xmath202 determines essential non - locality of the conductivity .",
    "let us present numerical estimation of the free path for the case of scattering by the bare coulomb impurities . in this case",
    "@xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium ( cdte in our case ) .",
    "for @xmath202 we have @xmath205    for material parameters we take magnitudes from @xcite : @xmath206mev nm , @xmath207 mev nm@xmath208 , @xmath209 mev nm@xmath208 , @xmath210 mev , @xmath211 . the calculated parameters are @xmath212nm@xmath213 , @xmath214nm@xmath213 , @xmath215cm / s , @xmath216 . at @xmath217mev , @xmath218 @xmath219 , @xmath220 nm , we get @xmath221 @xmath222 m .",
    "note , that exponential dependence of the mean free path on the width leads to quick growth of this parameter with @xmath22 .",
    "we have based on the topological protection of the edge states of ideal ti strip .",
    "the topological protection results in the equality of the strip conductance to the quantum independently on the strip length .",
    "however , we demonstrated that intervention of the interedge scattering makes long ti strip to be similar to a 1d wire of usual conductor : at large temperature the strip possesses the finite conductivity and at low temperature the localization occurs .",
    "the difference with a quantum wire consists in exponentially long ( with respect to the strip width ) mean free path and the localization length .",
    "this understanding resolves the imaginary contradiction between the theory of localization and the topological protection .",
    "it should be emphasized that our consideration is limited by the case when the electron energy exceeds the gap caused by interaction between edges .",
    "this limitation is not critical due to exponentially small value of the gap .",
    "let us discuss the correspondence with the experimental measurements @xcite . in experiments",
    "@xcite it was found that the conductivity of a macroscopic 2d ti is : i ) non - local , ii ) non - quantized and iii ) temperature - independent at low temperature .",
    "the case i ) means the edge character of conductivity while ii ) means deflection from the ballistic transport due to the backscattering .",
    "the case iii ) indicates on the impurity mechanism of the backscattering .",
    "very large macroscopic backscattering length in @xcite tells about weak influence of spin - flip scattering . the macroscopic system in @xcite is not narrow strip considered here . in a macroscopically wide device",
    "the transitions between the strip edge are forbidden .",
    "however , we think that the real ti can have many puddles of normal semiconductor phase due to the fluctuations of the hgte quantum well thickness .",
    "these puddles provide existence of multiple inner edges between ti and normal semiconductor",
    ". the chain of transitions between these edge states shall produce transition to the other external edge with the opposite direction of motion . if the impurities ( edge imperfections ) give the main contribution to this process in conditions of destroyed coherence one may expect no temperature dependence of the conductivity in accordance with @xcite .",
    "this possibility is alternative to the process discussed in @xcite .    in conclusions",
    ", we have solved problems of the conductivity of the infinitely long strip of the ti .",
    "at finite temperature the kinetic equation approach is valid . in this approximation",
    "the conductivity is determined by the mean free path due to the interedge backscattering on impurities , edge imperfections and phonons .",
    "the validity limit of this approach due to the dephasing caused by the phonon - induced intraedge forward scattering has been established .",
    "the non - local 4-terminal resistance coefficients have been also found .",
    "the low - temperature limit of the finite - wire conductance was examined on the basis of the localization theory .",
    "it should be emphasized that we have neglected the spin non - conservation caused by the spin - orbit interaction , magnetic impurities and superfine interaction .",

    "<S> impurities , edge irregularities , and phonons produce transitions between the contra - propagating edge states on different edges . </S>",
    "<S> this backscattering determines the conductivity of an infinitely long strip . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the conductivity exponentially grows with the strip width . </S>",
    "<S> the conductivity at finite temperature is determined within the framework of the kinetic equation . in the same approximation </S>",
    "<S> the non - local resistance coefficients of 4-terminal strip are found . at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> the localization occurs and 2-terminal conductance of long wire vanishes , but with the exponentially long ( with respect to the strip width ) localization length . </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperature between kinetic and localization behaviors has been found . </S>"
