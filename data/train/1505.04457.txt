    "the dynamics of an isolated quantum many - body system following an instantaneous change of a hamiltonian parameter _ ( quantum quench ) _ is a topic of growing interest @xcite .",
    "the problem touches on a multitude of subjects , from the foundation of quantum statistical physics to the engineering of quantum states and devices @xcite .",
    "a quench injects energy which disperses among the interacting degrees of freedom , and as time evolves local observables relax to their equilibrium values @xcite . when the quench is _ local _ , with a sudden change of a local parameter in a hamiltonian , the energy injected to the system is nonextensive . in such a case",
    "one may expect , and indeed finds @xcite , intermediate times at which wave propagation and reflection from boundaries can create slowly decaying oscillatory behaviour .",
    "this raises the question whether one could find a physically relevant model where , by tuning a pertinent parameter , the equilibration after a local quench of the hamiltonian is strongly suppressed , or even totally eliminated .    here , in point of fact",
    ", we show that , for the spin emulator @xcite of the two - impurity kondo model @xcite , a local quench into the kondo - screened phase @xcite induces the onset of long - lived oscillations . by analyzing the quench dynamics of the lowest eigenvalues of the entanglement spectrum @xcite",
    ", we find that the frequency @xmath0 of these oscillations is sharply determined if one tunes the impurity - spin interaction so that _ all _ spins become entangled with an impurity .",
    "remarkably , @xmath0 is independent of the local quench energy and scales as @xmath1 remaining constant when the system size @xmath2 increases .",
    "moreover , we find that the frequency @xmath0 leaves its fingerprints on local observables , including the spin - spin impurity correlation functions . as such",
    ", we believe that our finding is potentially relevant to future designs of spin - based quantum devices as the impurity spins do not seem to equilibrate despite being strongly connected to reservoirs .",
    "we consider a spin chain emulator of the two - impurity kondo model @xcite with two localized spin-1/2 , each coupled to a frustrated spin-1/2 heisenberg chain , and to each other via a ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as    , together with the rkky coupling @xmath3 , determines the extension of the entanglement length @xmath4 .",
    "the strength of the rkky coupling @xmath3 can be externally controlled ; for instance , in a quantum dot , by tuning gate voltages as indicated in the figure . for any @xmath5 , in the kondo regime , we define @xmath6 as the impurity coupling for which the entanglement length extends over the entire chain , i.e. @xmath7 . by quenching the rkky coupling @xmath3 from @xmath8 in the rkky regime to @xmath9 in the kondo phase one",
    "induces the non - equilibrium dynamics being studied here . for the sake of simplicity the next - nearest coupling @xmath10",
    "is not shown in the figure since we fixed @xmath11.,width=302,height=188 ]    @xmath12    where @xmath13 here @xmath14 labels the left and right chains , with @xmath15 the vector of pauli matrices at site @xmath16 on chain @xmath17 .",
    "the couplings @xmath18 and @xmath10 are nearest and next nearest neighbour couplings , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath19 plays the role of an antiferromagnetic kondo coupling between the impurities and their corresponding bulks and the dimensionless coupling @xmath20 measures the rkky impurity interaction .",
    "the mapping to the kondo model is valid for @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) @xcite since in this interval the bulk excitations are massless ( as in the full electronic version of the kondo problem ) .",
    "as we will see , our analysis of the quench dynamics applies to the entire kondo regime , although , for @xmath23 a marginal coupling ( in the sense of the renormalization group ) produces logarithmic corrections which pollutes the numerical data @xcite . in order to avoid this",
    ", we tune @xmath24 for which both @xmath25 and @xmath26 faithfully represent the spin sector of a single - impurity kondo model . note that the terms @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) each define a spin emulator of the single channel kondo model , with labels @xmath14 @xcite . a schematic picture of the model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the ground state shows a quantum phase transition at a critical value @xmath28 of the rkky coupling . for a small coupling @xmath3 the kondo interaction dominates and each impurity spin gets screened by its bulk ( kondo phase ) , while in the opposite limit the impurities form a local singlet ( rkky phase ) and decouple from the rest of the system @xcite",
    "having partitioned the system into two parts , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , one can write an arbitrary pure state in the orthogonal schmidt basis @xcite as @xmath31 where the ordered set of real numbers @xmath32 form the entanglement spectrum . the schmidt bases @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the left and right parts respectively .",
    "it has been shown that the two largest schmidt numbers dominate the entanglement spectrum , with their difference , @xmath36 , behaving as an order parameter at the quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "notably , all levels of the entanglement spectrum contribute essentially to the von neumann entropy @xmath37    in the kondo regime @xmath5 , the system supports a length scale @xmath4 which diverges at the critical point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it may be determined numerically by exploiting its interpretation as the length scale over which the two impurities are entangled with two identical blocks of spins on both sides @xcite .",
    "one thus finds , for a large but finite system with @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is a constant , with @xmath41 a critical exponent taking the value @xmath42 in the neighborhood of the critical point @xmath43 @xcite . according to eq .",
