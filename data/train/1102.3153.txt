    "recent infrared observations with _ spitzer _ and ground - based facilities ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ; graham 1990 ; farihi 2010 ) revealed near - infrared excesses around more than a dozen of metal - rich white dwarfs ( wds ) . this emission was interpreted as reprocessing of the wd radiation by refractory material residing in an extended , optically thick and geometrically thin disk ( jura 2003 ; jura 2007 ) , similar to the rings of saturn ( cuzzi 2010 ) .",
    "it was hypothesized by jura ( 2003 ) that such compact disks of high - z material may be naturally produced by tidal disruption of asteroid - like bodies entering the roche radius of the wd .",
    "this idea naturally explains the well defined outer radii @xmath5 r@xmath1 of disks since the roche radius @xmath6 for tidal disruption of a self - gravitating object of normal density ( @xmath7 g sm@xmath8 ) by @xmath9 m@xmath1 central mass is @xmath10 r@xmath1 ( jura 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , jura ( 2003 ) went on to suggest that the high - z material contained in compact disks is responsible for the observed metal enrichment of a significant fraction of wds .",
    "accretion of this _ circumstellar _ material at high enough rate @xmath11 onto wd could maintain a non - zero abundance of metals in the wd atmosphere against rapid gravitational settling .",
    "this scenario thus provides a promising alternative to the previously widely discussed _",
    "interstellar _ accretion model of wd metal pollution ( dupuis 1993 ) , which is known to have serious problems . observed abundances of heavy elements in wd atmospheres and theoretical calculations of their gravitational settling imply typical metal accretion rates @xmath12 g s@xmath3 ( farihi 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "an evolving disk of debris must be able to supply such high @xmath11 to the wd .",
    "however , the question of how high - z elements get transported to the wd atmosphere from the ring of solid particles , which does not extend all the way to the wd surface , has not yet been answered .    in principle , a dense ring of particles should evolve simply because of the angular momentum transfer due to inter - particle collisions , in full analogy with the rings of saturn .",
    "however , the evolution time scale of saturn s rings due to this process is too long , @xmath13 yr ( salmon 2010 ) , and resultant values of @xmath11 are negligible .",
    "another natural mechanism driving debris towards the wd is due to stellar radiation interacting with the disk and giving rise to the pointing - robertson ( pr ) drag ( burns 1979 ) .",
    "previously , farihi ( 2010 ) claimed that pr drag can not provide @xmath11 higher than @xmath14 g s@xmath3 and dismissed this process as irrelevant .",
    "the goal of this paper is to critically re - examine the effect of radiative forces on the debris disk evolution , and to show in particular that pr drag can give rise to @xmath11 inferred from observations .",
    "we envisage the following conceptual picture of the circum - wd environment .",
    "a dense disk ( or ring ) of particles lies inside the roche radius @xmath6 of the wd and evolves under the action of external agents , e.g. radiation forces .",
    "particles migrate through the disk towards the sublimation radius @xmath15 , where their equilibrium temperature equals the sublimation temperature @xmath16 : r_s= ( ) ^222  r_t_,4 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 , [ eq : r_s ] where @xmath17 is the wd radius , @xmath18 k for silicate grains , and @xmath19 k is the normalized stellar temperature @xmath20 . taking @xmath21 typical for massive ( @xmath22 m@xmath1 ) wds ( ehrenreich 2011 )",
    ", one finds @xmath23 r@xmath1 , in agreement with observationally inferred inner radii of compact debris disks ( jura 2007 , 2009a ) .",
    "thus , for cool wds @xmath24 is several .",
    "particles sublimate at @xmath15 feeding a disk of metallic gas , which we assume to be transparent to stellar radiation ( gaseous component has been detected in several wds with debris disks , see gnsicke etal 2006 ) .",
    "gaseous disk viscously evolves , extending all the way to the wd surface and providing means of metal delivery from @xmath15 to the star . assuming conventional @xmath25-parametrization of viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) @xmath26",
    ", the characteristic viscous time in the disk of metallic gas is t_~10   ( m_,1 ) ^1/2 , [ eq : t_nu ] where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the mean molecular weight of the metallic gas normalized by @xmath29 ( value of @xmath30 for pure si ) .",
    "this timescale is short enough for @xmath11 to be determined predominantly by evolution of the disk of solids .",
    "we take the disk of particles to be geometrically thin and characterize it at each point by optical depth @xmath31 defined as , [ eq : tau ] where @xmath32 is the surface mass density of debris disk , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the bulk density and characteristic size of the constituent particles ( we leave @xmath34 unspecified for now ) .",
    "observations suggest ( jura 2003 ; jura 2007 ) that @xmath35 but we leave @xmath31 arbitrary .    particles in a narrow annulus just outside the sublimation radius are exposed to direct starlight at normal incidence and are heated to sublimation temperature .",
    "farihi ( 2010 ) studied the effect of pr drag on particles in this region . here",
    "we first explore the effect of radiative forces on the rest of the disk , which has only its surface illuminated by the central star at grazing incidence . to account for the finite size of the wd",
    "we adopt a `` lamp - post '' model of stellar illumination , in which radiation is emitted by two point sources of luminosity @xmath36 each located at height @xmath37 above and below the disk plane , see figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "then = [ eq : alpha ] is the incidence angle of radiation on the disk surface at distance @xmath38 from the star , and @xmath39 since @xmath40 .",
    "the one - sided incident energy flux per unit surface area of the disk is @xmath41 , in agreement with friedjung ( 1985 ) .",
    "radiation falling on the disk gives rise to two forces that can change angular momentum of the disk : pr drag and the yarkovsky force .",
    "the latter owes its existence to thermal inertia of spinning objects that causes re - emission of absorbed energy in the direction different from that of incoming radiation ( bottke 2006 ) .",
    "azimuthal components of these forces per unit area of the disk can be represented as f_= , [ eq : f_pr ] where @xmath42 is the speed of light , and @xmath43 is the factor that characterizes the phase lag of radiative momentum deposition in disk particles and is specified later in  [ subsect : pr ] and  [ subsect : yar ] for pr drag and yarkovsky force respectively .",
    "factor @xmath44 characterizes the efficiency of radiative momentum absorption by the disk surface . in the geometrical optics limits ( particle size @xmath34 much larger than characteristic wave length of stellar radiation ) _ r1-e^- _ ,  _",
    "^-1 , [ eq : q ] where @xmath45 is the optical depth encountered by incident photons as they traverse the full disk thickness .",
    "optically thick debris disks have @xmath46 .",
    "azimuthal force causes radial drift of disk material at speed @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the keplerian angular frequency .",
    "this gives rise to mass transport at the rate m_z(r)=2r v_r_d=. [ eq : mdot_r ] note that for radiative forces both @xmath49 and @xmath11 are independent of @xmath32 .      in the case of pr drag factor",
    "@xmath43 is ( burns 1979 ) _",
    "pr=3.310 ^ -3 ( m_,1 ) ^1/2 [ eq : psipr ] leading to m_pr(r)&= & [ eq : mdot_pr ] + & & 10 ^ 8 ^ -1_r , where we used equations ( [ eq : alpha ] ) and ( [ eq : mdot_r ] ) .",
    "numerical estimate in equation ( [ eq : mdot_pr ] ) does not agree with the calculation of farihi ( 2010 ) and we demonstrate the origin of this discrepancy by following these authors and considering the inner edge of the disk where particles sublimate ( at @xmath50 ) . at the edge",
    "there is an annulus of the disk directly exposed to starlight ( i.e. @xmath51 , see figure [ fig : f1 ] ) with radial width l~_a^-1h , [ eq : l ] which follows from the relationship @xmath52 ( here @xmath53 is the disk thickness , @xmath54 and @xmath51 are the vertical and horizontal optical depths of the annulus ) .",
    "particles inside this annulus experience pr drag as individual objects , with little shadowing from nearby particles .",
    "the characteristic decay time of their semimajor axes is ( burns 1979 ) t_pr=. [ eq : t_pr ]    however , it only takes the fully exposed particles time @xmath55 to cross the annulus , reach the sublimation point , and evaporate , at which point they stop shadowing objects behind them . dividing the mass @xmath56 contained within the annulus by @xmath57 we derive the mass accretion rate inside the annulus : m_a~ ~_a , [ eq : dotm_a ] where we used definition ( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "mass conservation requires that @xmath58 so that the optical depth inside the annulus is @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and from equation ( [ eq : l ] ) the width of the annulus is @xmath61 .",
    "thus , as long as the disk outside the annulus is not transparent to incident stellar radiation ( i.e. @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) @xmath31 drops from its value @xmath64 outside of @xmath65 to @xmath54 inside .",
    "this is because fully exposed particles in the annulus experience stronger pr drag and migrate towards the wd faster than particles outside the annulus .",
    "the transition occurs at the distance @xmath66 outside the disk edge , where @xmath67 , see figure [ fig : f1 ] .    from observational point of view , the most interesting characteristic of the disk is the value of @xmath4 at sublimation point @xmath15 , since this is the rate at which disk of solids feeds gaseous disk , from which mass is transported onto the wd atmosphere by viscous torques .",
    "evaluating expression ( [ eq : mdot_pr ] ) at @xmath50 using equation ( [ eq : r_s ] ) we find m_pr , s&=&()^2 [ eq : massflux ] + & & 710 ^ 7 ^ -1_r(r_,-2 t_,4)^2 , where @xmath68 r@xmath1 ; then @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath70 depends on @xmath20 only quadratically .",
    "previously , graham ( 1990 ) obtained an empirical estimate of @xmath4 by assuming accretion to be driven by pr drag and dividing the observationally inferred disk mass ( surface area multiplied by @xmath71 , taking disk to be a monolayer of particles ) by @xmath72 , see equation ( [ eq : t_pr ] ) . even though their numerical estimate of @xmath73 g s@xmath3 is not very different from reality this method of deriving @xmath4 is not well motivated .",
    "later , farihi ( 2010 ) found a value of @xmath74 g s@xmath3 much lower than @xmath70 predicted by equation ( [ eq : massflux ] ) because they used @xmath72 instead of @xmath75 in computing @xmath76 .",
    "if circum - wd debris disks behave similarly to dense planetary rings one expects collisions in the disk to align particle spins predominantly parallel or anti - parallel to the disk normal , with non - zero and _ positive _ average spin ( prograde mean rotation ) and significant random spin component ( salo 1987 ; ohtsuki & toyama 2005 ) .",
    "the characteristic spin frequency is @xmath77 .",
    "thermal inertia of spinning particles causes re - emission of absorbed stellar energy in the direction different from the radial .",
    "this gives rise to azimuthal yarkovsky force , which causes _ outward _ orbital migration of disk particles spinning in prograde sense ( bottke 2006 ) .",
    "we now check whether this force can affect the pr - driven inward accretion of solids by estimating its typical magnitude .",
    "yarkovsky phase lag factor @xmath78 depends on two dimensionless parameters",
    ". one of them @xmath79 is the ratio of particle size @xmath34 to the penetration depth of the thermal wave @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the thermal conductivity and specific heat of particle material .",
    "another is the thermal parameter ( roughly the ratio of thermal time at depth @xmath83 to object s spin period ) @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the surface temperature of the body .",
    "the actual dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath86 and @xmath87 has been calculated in vokrouhlick ( 1998 , 1999 ) and these references should be consulted for details . for our current purposes",
    "it suffices to note that phase lag factor takes on a maximum value @xmath88 when @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and is smaller for other values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    to evaluate @xmath83 and @xmath87",
    "we assume that disk particles have composition typical for terrestrial silicate minerals such as olivine , in agreement with elemental abundances of metal - rich wd atmospheres ( zuckerman 2007 ; klein 2010 ) .",
    "then @xmath91 erg s@xmath3 cm@xmath3 k@xmath3 and @xmath93 erg g@xmath3 k@xmath3 at @xmath94 k ( roy 1993 ) . taking @xmath95 we can write l_=l_,s()^3/4 ,   = _ s()^3/2 , [ eq : pars ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the values of @xmath83 and @xmath87 at sublimation radius @xmath50 : l_,s&= & ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^1/4 ( ) ^3/2 [ eq : lnus ] + & & 1   ( ) ^3/2 , + _ s&= & ( ) ^3/4 ( ) ^1/4 [ eq : thetas ] + & & 10   ( ) ^3",
    "particle size @xmath34 needed for calculation of @xmath86 is not constrained by observations , although graham ( 1990 ) suggested that debris disk may consist of @xmath98 cm particles .",
    "if @xmath34 is several cm or larger ( so that @xmath89 ) then @xmath88 for fully illuminated particles at @xmath15 , see fig . 3 of vokrouhlick ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , in the dense debris disk only the upper ( or lower ) parts of particles , close to their spin axes , are directly illuminated by anisotropic starlight .",
    "this is because the latter illuminates the disk at small angle @xmath25 and most of particle surface is shadowed by other particles nearby ( thermal emission of these particles is on average isotropic in horizontal direction ) . from heuristic arguments",
    "one expects stellar heating to be mainly deposited at small colatitude @xmath99 from the particle spin axis .",
    "it is easier for thermal conduction to isotropize surface temperature distribution around the spin axis over this small polar cap region rather than over the whole particle surface ( as is assumed in standard calculation of @xmath78 ) , and this additionally lowers @xmath78 .",
    "thus , even if material properties of disk particles are favorable for maximizing @xmath78 ( as is the case for our estimates here ) one still should expect @xmath100 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : alpha ] ) and ( [ eq : mdot_r ] ) result in the following expression for yarkovsky - induced outward mass accretion rate at @xmath15 :    & & 2.410 ^ 8 ^ -1_r .",
    "this is somewhat higher than @xmath70 , thanks to the high adopted @xmath101 exceeding @xmath102 , see ( [ eq : psipr ] ) .",
    "however , this estimate may be very optimistic because of our poor knowledge of material properties and sizes of disk particles .",
    "finally , we note that observations do not reveal the existence of _ metal - poor _ wds with debris disks around them , which could plausibly exist if outward migration of particles due to the yarkovsky force were effective at stopping the pr - driven inward mass accretion .",
    "this provides additional evidence that yarkovsky effect does not play significant role in the circum - wd debris disk evolution .",
    "we now compare our theoretical predictions with data on @xmath11 inferred from observations of metal - rich wds . in figure",
    "[ fig : f2 ] we plot the values of @xmath11 from farihi ( 2009 , 2010 ) vs. stellar effective temperature @xmath20 separately for wds with and without debris disks detected via ir excesses .",
    "we also plot our analytical prediction for @xmath103 for different values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to see from figure [ fig : f2 ] that all systems with detected debris disks exhibit @xmath11 higher than @xmath70 .",
    "this is very encouraging since whenever wd is orbited by particulate disk one expects pr drag to set a lower limit of the mass flux at the level of @xmath70",
    ". this lower bound on @xmath11 is hard ( if at all possible ) to avoid .",
    "this constraint naturally explains a strong positive correlation between @xmath11 and the rate of disk occurrence found by farihi ( 2010 ) : the fraction of stars with compact debris disks is significantly higher for wds with high @xmath11 simply because systems with disks can not have low @xmath104 .",
    "all this strongly suggests that the pr drag indeed plays important and visible role in circum - wd debris disk evolution .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the lack of disk - hosting systems at low @xmath11 is not caused by some observational bias : disk - bearing wds with @xmath105 such as gd 16 ( farihi 2009 ) , gd 56 ( jura 2009a ) , g166 - 58 ( farihi 2008 ) have ( sometimes highly ) significant detections of ir excesses by _ spitzer_.    it is also clear from figure [ fig : f2 ] that there are metal - rich systems both with and without disks , in which @xmath11 significantly exceeds @xmath70 for a given @xmath20 , sometimes by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the most dramatic case is that of dazb wd gd 362 which has @xmath106 g s@xmath3 ( farihi 2009 ) , exceeding @xmath70 corresponding to its @xmath107 k by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "existence of such objects clearly implies that at least in some cases an additional accretion mechanism must operate on top of the pr drag , giving rise to very high @xmath11 .",
    "we suggest such a mechanism that naturally operates in presence of a debris disk in rafikov ( 2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "systems without detected debris disks tend to occupy a broad range of @xmath11 , both above and below @xmath70 .",
    "they may be interpreted as wds that were orbited by compact debris disks in recent past but have now completely ( or largely ) lost their disks to accretion . without active external source metals sediment out from atmospheres of these wd resulting in lower",
    "inferred @xmath11 in systems that had longer time since their debris disk disappearance .",
    "lifetime of a debris disk of mass @xmath109 accreting via pr drag alone can be estimated as @xmath110 myr for @xmath111 g ( roughly corresponding to the mass of 200 km asteroid ) and @xmath4 typical for a wd with @xmath112 k. this estimate only marginally agrees with observational constraints suggesting several @xmath113 yr disk lifetime ( farihi 2009 ) .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that this is an upper limit on the lifetime that is realized if no other processes apart from the pr drag drive accretion of solids through the disk .",
    "in conclusion we would like to emphasize the robust nature of the mass accretion due to pr drag .",
    "our estimate ( [ eq : massflux ] ) of @xmath70 depends neither on the disk properties such as @xmath32 ( as long as @xmath62 ) or @xmath109 nor on the material properties of its constituent particles .",
    "also , @xmath70 does not vary much as @xmath16 or @xmath17 change within reasonable limits .",
    "one may worry that our calculation essentially disregards the details of the particle sublimation process .",
    "however , @xmath70 is set by stellar illumination _",
    "outside _ the innermost annulus of directly exposed particles at the inner edge of the disk , see  [ subsect : pr ] .",
    "there sublimation is irrelevant and our calculations are robust .",
    "interior of that point @xmath11 does not change by continuity and , as a result , mass accretion rate ends up being insensitive to how exactly directly exposed particles sublimate ."
