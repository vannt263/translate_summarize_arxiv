    "the study of the connections between the quantized energy eigenvalues of a bound state and the classical motions of the corresponding classical point particle has undergone something of a renaissance as the ability to experimentally probe the quantum - classical interface has dramatically improved .",

    "the time - dependence of fully quantum mechanical wave packet solutions of the schrdinger equation also depends critically on the energy spectrum , both for the short - term semi - classical propagation as well as for longer - term , purely quantum mechanical effects such as wave packet revivals .",

    "two - dimensional billiard systems have provided easily visualizible examples relevant for both types of analyses .",
    "for example , the periodic orbit theory analysis of square / rectangular @xcite and spherical / circular @xcite geometries were among the first performed , while on the experimental side , the energy level structure and statistics of microwave cavities @xcite ( modeling 2d billiards of arbitrary shape ) have been probed to test both periodic orbit theory and to obtain statistical evidence of chaotic behavior .",
    "measurements of conductance fluctuations in ballistic microstructures @xcite have been tentatively used to identify frequency features in the power spectrum with specific closed orbits in a circular ( and stadium ) billiard .",
    "more recently , the realization of atom - optics billiards @xcite , with ultra - cold atoms in arbitrary shaped 2d boundaries confined by optical dipole potentials , has allowed the study of various chaotic and integrable shapes such as the stadium , ellipse and circle , again for short - term , semi - classical propagation .",
    "the one- @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite , @xcite square wells , with their integral energy spectra , have provided simple examples of exact wave packet revivals , wherein initially localized states which have a short - term , quasi - classical time evolution , can then spread significantly over several orbits , only to reform later in the form of a quantum revival in which the spreading reverses itself , the wave packet relocalizes , and the semi - classical periodicity is once again evident .",
    "circular billiards have also been recently studied @xcite where approximate revivals have been found to be present under some circumstances .",
    "one billiard system which has not been analyzed in as much detail is the case of the equilateral ( or @xmath3 ) triangle quantum infinite well or billiard .",
    "if one thinks of the square billiard as an @xmath5 regular polygon , with the circle being the @xmath6 limit , the @xmath7 case of an equilateral triangular billiard is an obvious extension .",
    "since the exact bound state wavefunctions for the corresponding infinite well problem have been available for some time @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , our purpose here will be to apply these known results and analyze the quantum mechanics of this system in the context of periodic orbit theory as well as wave packet revivals . given how few quantum systems , especially billiard geometries , have closed - form solutions , it is very useful to have another such example analyzed in as much detail as possible .",
    "in addition , the energy eigenvalues for this case , described by simple quadratic powers of quantum numbers , just as for the 2d square billiard , will be seen to yield exact quantum revivals , providing another interesting ` testbed ' for possible future experimental tests .    in section  ii ,",

    "we have used the triangular billiard , with its simple energy spectrum , as a model system to probe periodic orbit theory and wave packet revivals . similarly to the cases of the square ( @xmath5 polygon ) and circular ( @xmath6 polygon ) billiards , we find that for the equilateral triangular ( @xmath7 ) infinite well the periodic orbit theory analysis agrees well with expectations , including special isolated orbits for various ` folded ' versions ; for the case here , we find a special isolated orbit in the ` full - well ' version as well .",

    "the case considered here might also be used as a basis for a more systematic examination of the quantum energy spectrum of the @xmath32 polygon , namely the hexagonal billiard .",
    "the solutions here will form a subset of the allowed spectrum of the @xmath32 case and an examination of both the periodic orbits and wave packet revivals in such a system will require the complete enumeration of the energy eigenvalues , either in closed form , or perhaps using various approximation methods @xcite : having a subset of energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions for which the results are known exactly would , of course , provide a very useful ` benchmark ' for any numerical calculation .",
    "that case would also be another interesting example of a @xmath205 billiard @xcite .",
    "such a result would be useful in probing the pattern of wave packet revivals as one goes from the @xmath206 cases ( where exact revivals are present ) to the @xmath6 ( circular ) case , where only approximate revivals exist .",

    "ii(c ) we exhibited several simple transformations of the @xmath60 quantum numbers of the equilateral triangular well which , when applied to allowed @xmath60 pairs , returned quantum numbers and corresponding energy eigenvalues appropriate to higher energy states which , in turn , could be easily visualized in terms of simple ` foldings ' of the half - well .",
