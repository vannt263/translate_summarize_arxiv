    "magnetic reconnection is considered to source the rapid conversion of magnetic energy in various solar coronal activities with extremely high lundquist number @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the current sheet length , alfvn speed and magnetic diffusivity , respectively .",
    "the two classical reconnection models are the sweet - parker model @xcite and petschek s model @xcite . in the sweet - parker model ,",
    "the reconnection rate scales as @xmath4 , several orders of magnitude slower than required in many solar and astronomical applications .",
    "the petschek s model yields a sufficiently fast reconnection rate ( @xmath5 ) by virtue of the localized diffusion region and the extended slow - mode shocks .",
    "the localized diffusion region is thought to originate from microscopic plasma processes occurring on scales many orders of magnitude smaller than the global scale .",
    "thus , it is necessary to address the huge scale gap between the micro and the global scales while maintaining efficient global energy conversion .",
    "@xcite argued that sweet - parker sheets with aspect ratio ( i.e. , length to thickness ) exceeding @xmath6 are vulnerable to secondary tearing instability .",
    "@xcite developed a fractal reconnection model based on this concept .",
    "they reasoned that once plasmoids are formed by the primary tearing instability , plasmoid ejection and growth stretch the intervening current sheets , increasing the aspect ratio of the current sheets .",
    "eventually these current sheets become unstable to secondary tearing , and disintegrate into chains of smaller - scale plasmoids and current sheets . by this stepwise process",
    ", an initially long and thick current sheet can reduce to the scale of the ion larmor radius or ion inertial length .",
    "this hierarchical structure can plausibly couple the largest and smallest scales .",
    "high - resolution numerical simulations have proved the feasibility of this scheme @xcite and also showed that the reconnection rate becomes independent of the lundquist number when @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this fractal reconnection model assumes translational invariance in the direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane .",
    "this assumption is violated in the presence of three - dimensional ( 3d ) instabilities , such as the kink - like instability reported by @xcite .",
    "these authors found fast growth and saturation of the tearing mode along the anti - parallel magnetic field .",
    "meanwhile , the oblique modes ( with a component perpendicular to the tearing plane ) continue growing and dominate in the later phase .",
    "moreover , in the absence of a guide field , this kink - like instability will suppress the coalescence instability in the tearing layer , completely breaking the initial laminar structure @xcite .",
    "this instability is expected to affect the fractal reconnection in 3d scenario .",
    "another concern is the emergence of multiple tearing layers @xcite .",
    "when a sheared current sheet is subjected to a multi - modal perturbation ( comprising modes @xmath8 ) , multiple layers whose local magnetic field orientation satisfy @xmath9 can emerge and are expected to interact when they become sufficiently close .",
    "interaction should disrupt the laminar structures of the layers , altering their internal fractal reconnections .",
    "@xcite studied the nonlinear evolution of several tearing layers coexisting inside a sheared current sheet in an incompressible plasma .",
    "they found that although the two - dimensional ( 2d ) mode grows more rapidly than the emerging modes in a linear analysis , the emerging modes are oblique modes at an early stage .",
    "the resulting energy cascade gradually extends outwards from the current sheet center , leading to a final turbulent state .",
    "moreover , the inverse energy transfer implies coalescence of the magnetic islands .",
    "@xcite further confirmed the three - dimensionality of the initially emerging modes in a compressible plasma simulation .",
    "thus , the preferred source of plasmoid instability growth is changed and the reconnection enhancement concept should be modified in the 3d case . but",
    "neither @xcite nor @xcite explicitly discussed the changes in the reconnection rate . for this purpose , we seek more details of the magnetic energy consumption .",

    "when entering the turbulent state ( after @xmath172 ; see fig.@xmath34[fig14](d ) ) , the dense regions essentially overlap with the structures of fig.@xmath34[fig14](a ) and ( c ) , and the current density inside the current sheet is universally enhanced .",
    "although the inflow structure is segmented , the global effect can be regarded as a single long diffusion region . moreover , beyond @xmath173 , the @xmath164 well correlates with the reconnection rate ( black dash - dotted line in fig.@xmath34[fig14](b ) ) .",
    "the enhanced @xmath164 suggests that , on macroscopic scale , magnetic energy is carried into the global current sheet by the flow and converted into other forms of energy .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the rising reconnection rate in later phase .",
    "the average global inflow exceeds the reconnection rate at approximately @xmath66 , indicating that a small portion of the magnetic energy is stored before being gradually consumed .    , showing the development of a slow - mode shock .",
    "variables are plotted at @xmath174 ( black solid lines ) , @xmath175 ( blue solid lines ) , @xmath71 ( orange solid lines ) .",
    "crosses indicate the grid points .",
    "red dash - dotted line is the detected shock front at @xmath66 .",
    "black horizontal dotted lines denote the shock speed in lab - frame . ]",
    "when the inflow enhancement is high , slow - mode shocks gradually form between the inward flow and the outwardly growing flux tube . along with reconnection in the diffusion region , these shocks are a likely mechanism of magnetic energy conversion .",
    "shocks are identified by comparing the upstream and downstream quantities in the shock frames at selected points .",
    "slow - mode shocks in the simulation domain are required to satisfy the following criteria : + 1 .",
    "rankine - hugoniot relations : the rankine - hugoniot relations in the downstream must not deviate by more than 30% of their upstream values @xcite ; + 2 .",
    "velocities must satisfy @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the normal component ( perpendicular to the shock front ) of the upstream velocity . @xmath178 and",
    "@xmath179 are the alfvn speed and the slow - mode wave phase speed , respectively , in the upstream ; + 3 .",
    "@xmath180 , where @xmath181 denotes the normal component of the downstream flow speed and @xmath182 is the slow - mode wave phase speed in the downstream ; + 4 .",
    "the @xmath183 and @xmath184 of the upstream and downstream must be co - planar ( within @xmath185 ) .",
    "fig.@xmath34[fig15 ] shows the development of a slow - mode shock wave .",
    "plotted are the current density @xmath186 , plasma pressure @xmath187 , magnetic pressure @xmath188 , entropy @xmath189 , plasma density @xmath190 , plasma velocity @xmath153 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 across @xmath193 in laboratory frame at three time points ( for tracking the transition ) .",
    "the entropy is normalized by @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the specific heat at constant volume .",
    "the shock speed in the laboratory frame is indicated by the black dotted line in the plasma velocity plots . at @xmath196 ( black solid lines in fig.@xmath34[fig15 ] ) ,",
    "the density is compressed around @xmath197 .",
    "the local @xmath198 is minimized at the @xmath39-axial boundary of the flux tube . at this moment ,",
    "the local @xmath39-directional flow on either side of the flux tube boundary is relatively weak . as the reconnection becomes more efficient , the flux tube thickens and expands in the negative @xmath39-direction . the relative flow between inside and outside of the tube boundary increases , further compressing the local plasma ( compression occurs around @xmath199 ) .",
    "eventually ( at @xmath66 ) , the shock criteria are reached .",
    "the approximate position of the shock front is indicated as red dash - dotted line in fig.@xmath34[fig15 ] .",
    "we fail to find the rotational discontinuity previously reported in reconnection with a guide field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "blue surface represents @xmath200 . ]",
    "along with local ohmic heating , these slow - mode shocks are considered as an additional source of magnetic energy consumption , as shown in petschek s work .",
    "the energy conversion capability of shock ( reduction of poynting flux across the shock ) @xmath201 is calculated as : @xmath202                \\cdot ds}{2b_{0}^{2}l_{y}l_{z}}.\\ ] ] the first and second terms of numerator denote the upstream and downstream poynting vectors , respectively .",
    "the @xmath201 is plotted as a function of time in fig.@xmath34[fig16](a ) .",
    "the efficiency of these shocks is greatly increased at the end of the simulation . to understand the global layout of the slow - mode shocks ,",
    "we calculate the total percentage area coverage sc of the shock : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the total area covered by the shock .",
    "the coefficient `` 4 '' in the denominator indicates that four tearing layers coexist in the central current sheet .",
    "the temporal evolution of sc is plotted in fig.@xmath34[fig16](b ) . both @xmath205 and sc increase from @xmath135 . especially in the later phase , when the global inflow booms ( after @xmath206 ) , large extent of slow - mode shocks with efficient energy conversion capability are detected .",
    "the approximate downstream positions of all shocks found in the domain are highlighted in red in fig.@xmath34[fig17 ] .",
    "the blue isosurface is the flux tube surface with @xmath200 .    in summary , multiple tearing layers",
    "construct a positive - feedback system that promotes reconnection .",
    "large amount of magnetic energy is transported into the current sheet and converted to other forms of energy .",
    "outwardly growing flux tubes collide with the strong inflow , gradually arousing slow - mode shocks along the tube boundaries .",
    "these shocks further enhance the reconnection .",
    "therefore , we refer to our model as the  shock - evoking positive - feedback \" model .",
    "in our present model , the reconnection rate is enhanced by non - linear interactions among multiple ( tearing ) layers .",
    "our observed interactions resemble the double tearing mode ( dtm ) reported in the previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several comparisons are worth a brief mention here .",
    "first , the unperturbed state of dtm has multiple independent current sheets , whereas our model begins with a single current sheet .",
    "the multiple current layers are consequent to the growth of the tearing layers by mixed perturbations .",
    "such growth of multiple layers requires a 3d system and a moderate guide field .",
    "second , dtm is essentially a 2d process because translational invariance is assumed along the guide field direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the arrangement of diffusion regions are maintained in that direction . in our model ,",
    "the arrangement of diffusion regions differs among @xmath56-positions ( see section 3.3 ) and periodically changes from symmetric to asymmetric . because of this non - uniformity , positive - feedback system is intermittently distributed .",
    "our model is expected to consume magnetic energy less efficiently than dtm .",
    "nevertheless , our model substantially enhances the reconnection rate .",
    "third , as also shown in section 3.3 , the energy release may be slow in regions of symmetric arrangement of diffusion regions from different tearing layers .",
    "notably , however , reconnection proceeds in symmetric dtm structures albeit very slowly @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with our model .    in applying our model to realistic systems , such as solar flares",
    ", we must reconsider the boundary effects and the resistivity , which is much larger in our model than in solar phenomena . in our simulation , the selection of the tearing layers is highly influenced by the box size ; in other words , by the aspect ratio of the initial current sheet . in a much larger system",
    "enclosing a current sheet with an extremely large aspect ratio , the evolution should be influenced by the boundary effects .",
    "if the plasma @xmath44 is high in the current sheet , local alfvn speed is slow .",
    "the evolution may be locally determined and the system will behave as an open system with free outflows . in low-@xmath44 plasma , the evolution",
    "is globally determined and influenced by the boundary conditions at both ends of the field lines . meanwhile , the most unstable tearing mode depends on both the resistivity and the guide field . however , we argue that once the emerging multiple tearing layers are sufficiently close to interact ( separated within several @xmath207 , where @xmath207 is the width of tearing layer ) , a positive - feedback system is built .",
    "conversely , if the multiple layers approach very closely ( within @xmath207 ) , they will behave as a single layer .",
    "these propositions require investigation in further study ; for instance , we should elucidate the scaling law that relates the lundquist number to the reconnection rate , survey the guide field strength parameter and investigate the boundary condition .",
    "we must also improve the resolution and precision of our simulation .",
    "finally , we propose an extended model based on our  shock - evoking positive - feedback \" model , which operates similar to 2d hierarchical reconnection . in the later phase of our simulation ,",
    "long and thin current sheets with sheared magnetic structures remain near the center , which are candidate structures for further tearing .",
    "@xcite simulated reconnection in a single current sheet under a guide field effect in the kinetic regime .",
    "they reported secondary flux ropes resulting from tearing instability .",
    "no secondary filamentary structure is observed in our model , likely because of the low resolution .",
    "higher - ranking filaments are expected in our model when the lundquist number and resolution are improved . once the extended current sheet becomes unstable to the tearing instability , there are two possibilities .",
    "if the most unstable mode is centralized , a single tearing layer can be identified , as occurs in 2d plasmoid instability .",
    "conversely , if the most unstable mode is oblique @xcite , multiple tearing layers should emerge .",
    "the coexisting multiple layers resemble the primary current sheet structure .",
    "once established , the positive - feedback system enhances local reconnection .",
    "flux tubes at the same side grow and merge with each other .",
    "slow - mode shocks are evoked along the outer boundary , while extended current sheets form between the coalesced flux tubes .",
    "these remaining current sheets might be subject to further tearing instability .",
    "therefore , in a series of steps , the global structural scale of the diffusion region could reduce to microscopic size ( such as the ion inertial scale ) by alternate applications of 2d plasmoid instability and the 3d  shock - evoking positive - feedback \" model .",
    "we regard this fractal structure of the current sheet generated by the  shock - evoking positive - feedback \" model as an extension of the hierarchical structure of 2d plasmoid instability .",
    "our scenario is illustrated in fig.@xmath34[fig18 ] , assuming that multiple tearing layers are realized in each rank .",
    "in this study , we simulate a 3d mhd magnetic reconnection across a symmetric current sheet with a finite guide field .",
    "we assume a uniform resistive environment and randomly perturb the initial velocity field . when relaxing the variation along the direction of the guide field , we find that the guide field increases the reconnection rate of the whole current sheet by several times , relative to the simulation with no guide field .",
    "most unstable tearing modes , with components in the sheet - wise direction , emerge on multiple resonance layers .",
    "the diffusion regions on these layers establish a zigzag pattern that couple the inflow region and outflow region on different layers .",
    "consequently , the outflow is diverted into the inflow region , ensuring that reconnection proceeds in the opposite layer .",
    "gradually , the inflow from outside of the global current sheet also becomes accelerated by continuous activation of individual reconnection site .",
    "this enhanced inflow arouses slow - mode shocks along the outer boundary of the current sheet , further promoting energy conversion .",
    "we refer to our model as the  shock - evoking positive - feedback \" model .",
    "the lundquist number is much smaller in our numerical experiment than in the solar corona .",
    "therefore , our model is not directly applicable to real solar activities . to understand the feasibility of the  shock - evoking positive - feedback \" in low resistive environments",
    ", we must conduct a parameter survey on the diffusivity magnitude .",
    "altering the resistivity and guide field strength would induce different most unstable tearing modes , thus changing the topology of the positive - feedback system . in future study",
    ", we will further evaluate the effectiveness of our model by varying @xmath33 and @xmath3 .",
    "the limited resolution of our model precludes the detection of finer filamentary structure .",
    "if the remaining long , thin current sheet becomes vulnerable to tearing instability , the internal sheared structure might develop into a higher - ranking positive - feedback system .",
    "the mechanism of the  shock - evoking positive - feedback \" model would then enhance the local reconnection rate . in this way",
    ", the pattern could be repeated on ever smaller scales , eventually reaching the microscopic scale in environments of large lundquist number .",
    "therefore , we have potentially expanded 2d fractal reconnection into a 3d hierarchical structure with a high energy conversion rate .",
    "this capability of our model needs to be tested on very fine simulation grids , another goal of our future work .",
    "this research was conducted using the fujitsu primehpc fx10 system ( oakleaf - fx , oakbridge ) in the information technology center , the university of tokyo .",
