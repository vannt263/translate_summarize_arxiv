    "experimental progress in the past 5 years has led to a large number of experimental studies of magnetic and nonmagnetic transition - metal impurities in semiconductors using advanced scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) techniques.@xcite this effort was motivated in part by the hope that the high - resolution imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopic power of the stm could help in developing an accurate microscopic picture of dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) magnetism . in dmss magnetic impurities",
    "provide local moments , which can couple to yield a collective ferromagnetic state . in the prototypical dms , ( ga , mn)as",
    ", the mn impurities act as acceptors providing itinerant holes that can mediate long - range interactions between local moments . among the open issues in dms physics@xcite",
    "are the precise character of the hole states , the nature of the coupling of the holes with the local magnetic moments , and the properties of the ensuing magnetic interaction between local moments .",
    "stm experiments performed recently@xcite are playing a decisive role in clarifying some of these issues .    in ref .",
    "[ ] stm substitution techniques were used to incorporate individual mn atoms into ga sites in a gaas ( 110 ) surface .",
    "real - space spectroscopic measurements in the vicinity of an isolated mn impurity revealed the presence of a mid - gap resonance arising from a mn induced acceptor state .",
    "high - resolution imaging showed that the acceptor wave function is strongly anisotropic with respect to the crystal axes of the host .",
    "when two mn atoms were incorporated close to each other , two resonances appeared in the gap , split by approximately 0.5 ev .",
    "the splitting was found to be strongly dependent on the mn pair orientation with respect to the gaas crystal structure and on mn separation .",
    "a simple toy model , describing acceptor states coupled to the mn ion local moments of the two impurities,@xcite suggested that a measurable splitting of the acceptor levels could only occur if the two mn local moments were ferromagnetically aligned.@xcite since acceptor - level splitting is an observable indicator of ferromagnetic coupling , it seemed plausible that the dependence of this splitting on separation should be related at least qualitatively to the mn - mn exchange interaction .",
    "if so , the stm experiment could be used to measure exchange interactions between the mn moments and test theories of this interaction .",
    "one of the purposes of the present study is to examine this relationship quantitatively .",
    "several of the experimental features uncovered in ref .",
    "[ ] could be qualitatively accounted for theoretically by a tight - binding model calculation for mn in bulk gaas presented in the same paper .",
    "a more thorough comparison between experiments and theoretical modeling , both for mn atoms in the bulk _ and mn near the surface _ is nevertheless necessary to interpret the experiments , motivating the present theoretical work .",
    "here we consider a kinetic @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange tight - binding model@xcite in which the effective exchange interaction between the hole states and the local mn moments arises from hybridization of the impurity @xmath3 levels with @xmath2 levels of the host .",
    "the model is solved numerically for large super - clusters containing up to 3200 atoms .",
    "this approach allows us to place the mn pair either in bulk gaas or on the ( 110 ) surface .    within this model",
    ", we study the electronic and magnetic properties of mn pairs in gaas , assuming that the two local magnetic moments are collinear , having either parallel [ ferromagnetic ( fm ) ] or antiparallel [ antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ] relative orientation . one of our goals is to study the spin - orbit induced magnetic anisotropy energy of the system and see how this quantity is related to the properties of the mid - gap acceptor states . in the fm configuration the magnetic moment tends to point along the direction of the pair , while in the afm configuration there is typically a quasi - easy plane perpendicular to the pair direction . as in the isolated mn impurity case previously studied,@xcite we find that the sum of the individual anisotropy energies of the top two unoccupied valence band orbitals , mirrors the total anisotropy of the system .",
    "this shows that the picture of mn - mn interactions mediated by valence band holes is valid , and simplifies the interpretation of our numerical results .",
    "we then consider the properties of the acceptor levels for the two possible relative orientations of the mn magnetic moments . in the fm configuration , which is generally found to be the ground state for most mn pair orientations and mn separations , the acceptor levels lie in a group just above the valence - band maximum and have a splitting that is enhanced by inter - ion hybridization .",
    "the group of six split levels can be viewed as a nascent version of the impurity band which forms in the bulk at small but finite mn concentrations.in the following , we will make a loose use of the expression _ impurity band _ to indicate this group of six split impurity levels in the gap . ] in particular , the two unoccupied acceptor levels ( i.e. occupied by holes ) , which fully determine both magnetic interaction and anisotropy energies have a finite splitting , which can be measured in experiment . for mn pairs in bulk , we find that the acceptor splitting varies strongly with pair orientation and mn separation , in agreement with experiment and previous calculations.@xcite the splitting is maximal for the most closely spaced mn pair oriented along the @xmath0 direction , where it is of the order of few hundred mev , and very small for pairs oriented along @xmath1 .",
    "for some mn pairs , the wave functions of the two acceptor states have bonding and antibonding character , which is again consistent with experiment.@xcite these results support the validity of the kinetic @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange model .    in our study",
    "the energy difference between fm and afm moment orientations is related to partial occupation of the acceptor impurity levels , which are split more widely in the fm configuration .",
    "when we calculate the exchange constant @xmath4 for the mn - mn interaction , as the difference between the ground - state energies of the two configurations , we find that @xmath4 is not in one - to - one correspondence with the splitting between the two unoccupied acceptor levels .",
    "in particular , the level splitting is much more anisotropic than @xmath4 with respect to the mn pair orientation . on the other hand , we find that estimates of the width of the distribution of all impurity levels  occupied and unoccupied  are more directly related to @xmath4 .",
    "effective exchange interactions between mn ions in bulk ( ga , mn)as have been calculated by several groups using either _ ab initio _ methods or more phenomenological approaches .",
    "comparison of our results with other estimates is not always straightforward , since we have only two mn moments and the exchange interactions are not strictly pairwise .",
    "the order of magnitude of our @xmath4 is nevertheless consistent with published results obtained from first - principles calculations , although values of @xmath4 for specific mn pair directions and separations may differ .",
    "however , it is well - known that dmss are not accurately described by the local - density - approximation often used in first principles methods",
    ". the discrepancies could either be due to the shortcomings of our model or to the inaccuracies of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we have also looked at how the mn pairs interact when they are placed in a ( 110 ) gaas surface .",
    "typically , we find that the acceptor wave functions become highly localized at the surface and produce states that are deep in the band gap . as a result , the long - range interactions are much weaker and antiferromagnetic alignment of mn spins is more likely to occur .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energies at the surface are an order of magnitude smaller than in bulk , and tend to produce quasi - easy planes at close distances , reverting to isolated mn anisotropy landscapes at larger separations . for mn pairs in the ( 110 ) surface",
    ", the long - range behavior of the acceptor wave functions and acceptor splitting seems to agree less well with experiment than for mn pairs in bulk gaas .",
    "the tight - binding model that we use is of course less well justified when the mn pair is in the surface .",
    "however , effects present in the experiment may contribute to this difference .",
    "in addition to an uncertainty in model parameters at the surface due to band - bending shifts of the acceptors , a large overlap with continuum states due to zn co - dopants in the sample can cause a more extended , bulk - like mn acceptor wave function . beyond the scope of the present paper ,",
    "care should also be taken in simulating the change in the effective potential experienced by surface electrons due to the addition and removal process introduced by the stm .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that modeling stm studies of the surface of a system as complicated as ( ga , mn)as is highly nontrivial and requires additional work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theorysection ] we review some theoretical aspects of the ( ga , mn)as system and give a brief introduction to our tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "we also elaborate on a toy model that gives an idea of the system behavior expected when the mn moments are parallel or antiparallel .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review the basic physics of mn impurities in gaas , which motivates the choice of the tight - binding hamiltonian@xcite used throughout the paper . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to ref .",
    "[ ] , where the same model was used to investigate the properties of individual mn atoms in gaas .    in the neutral state , consisting of the mn@xmath5 ion on a ga site with a weakly bound hole ,",
    "the mn has spin @xmath6 and orbital moment @xmath7.@xcite this is in accordance with hund s first rule that survives even when the mn is embedded in the crystal .",
    "the mn @xmath8 electrons build up large , localized magnetic moments .",
    "because the mn is missing the ga 4@xmath2 valence electron , it introduces a hole in the system , simultaneously acting as an acceptor and a source of magnetic moments . in bulk , the holes introduced by many mn impurities form itinerant carriers that mediate the ferromagnetic coupling between localized moments .",
    "[ cartoon2 ] shows a schematic drawing of what happens when a mn substitutes a ga in the gaas lattice.@xcite the mn @xmath8 up states ( for example ) that lodge in the valence band are exchange - split from the down states that end up in the conduction band .",
    "the crystal field imposes the tetrahedral host symmetry , resulting in a further split into a doublet of @xmath9 symmetry and a triplet of @xmath10 symmetry.@xcite the @xmath9 states couple only weakly to the host .",
    "the @xmath10 states on the other hand , hybridize with the as nearest neighbor dangling - bond @xmath2 states at the top of the valence band , forming bonding and antibonding combinations . effectively , the neighboring as @xmath2 spins at the top of the valence band that are parallel to the mn spin are shifted up in energy , whereas @xmath2 spins that are antiparallel to the mn spin are shifted down .",
    "therefore , the main effect of a single substitutional mn with spin up , is to introduce three spin - polarized ( `` up '' ) levels above the top of the valence band and three spin - polarized ( `` down '' ) levels below .",
    "these six states are predominantly of as @xmath2 character .",
    "the hole introduced by a single mn will occupy the highest of the three antibonding states ( indicated by the empty circle in fig .",
    "[ cartoon2 ] ) . in this way",
    ", the hybridization mechanism gives rise to an antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant and localized spins by what is known as zener s kinetic - exchange mechanism.@xcite we account for this @xmath2-@xmath3 indirect exchange by introducing a classical mn vector of magnitude 5/2 , which couples to the neighboring as @xmath2 states .",
    "there are no explicit @xmath3 electrons in our model ; they are accounted for only implicitly via the exchange interaction between the localized moments and the as @xmath2 spins on neighboring sites .",

    "the spin is no longer a good quantum number , but we will assume that these states still have a predominant spin character , which is the same as when so interaction is absent .    when two mn impurities are present and close to each other , the system can lower the total energy by allowing hopping between two single - particle states with the _ same spin _ , each centered around one of the two mn .",
    "two different situations arise depending on whether the relative orientation of the two mn moments is parallel or antiparallel .",
    "we assume that each state @xmath39 , with @xmath40 at mn site @xmath14 will be coupled to the corresponding same spin state @xmath41 at the other mn site @xmath15 by an effective hopping parameter @xmath42 , which we take to be spin - independent .",

    "the hamiltonian is immediately diagonalized by noting that the spin and orbital characters are good quantum numbers .",
    "the nature of the resulting hybridized levels will depend on the relative orientation of the two mn moments : in the fm configuration the two sets of unperturbed equal - spin states ( one at each mn site ) are degenerate and will form bonding and antibonding combinations via hopping .",
    "by contrast , in the afm configuration like - spins at different mn sites have different energies and the hybridization will be reduced by a factor @xmath46 .    in the afm configuration",

    "the maximum gain occurs for the half - filled  system consisting of six holes . for the case of two mn introducing two holes ( shown in fig .",
    "[ afm_pair ] ) , the energy gain of the afm configuration is approximately @xmath51 .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the superexchange mechanism  arising within a one - band hubbard model at half filling  which favors antiferromagnetic alignment of the itinerant spins on neighboring sites .",
    "note that there are no @xmath3 electrons present in our model and that the superexchange between the local moments is brought about by the kinetic exchange between the itinerant spins . when the two mn atoms are close to each other , oppositely aligned mn spins allow the wave functions to spread out , thus lowering their kinetic energy by hopping .    in the fm configuration",
    "the spectrum is nondegenerate @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are bonding and antibonding states respectively .",
    "the acceptor ( hole ) states are more bound when they are further away from the valence band top , which is the start of the continuum for hole states . out of the two acceptor states arising from the hybridization of the degenerate like - spin states of energy @xmath55 , we therefore assign the label bonding  to the one that occurs at higher energy , while the one with lower energy is denoted as antibonding  [ see eq .",

    "an energy gain equal to @xmath62 occurs only when an odd number of holes are present . the opposite limit of a large hopping parameter , @xmath63 , is shown in fig .  [ fm_pair_2 ] . since only two thirds of the impurity band",
    "is filled there is a net energy gain @xmath64 due to the level splitting , which can stabilize the fm configuration against the afm one .",
    "this mechanism that couples the itinerant spins ferromagnetically , corresponds to double exchange between the two sites . for a partially occupied impurity band the fm alignment tends to be energetically more favorable than the afm when the widening of the band induced by hopping is large .",
    "the difference between the total energies of the two configurations defines an effective exchange constant @xmath65 representing a heisenberg - like magnetic interaction , @xmath66 , between the local moments at the two mn sites .",

    "[ afm_pair]-[fm_pair_2 ] .",

    "the splitting is noticeably absent in the afm configuration , where the two acceptor states are quasi - degenerate , and is therefore a landmark of the fm state . as mentioned in the introduction , the stm experiments do measure a significant splitting between the two acceptor states , which is a strong indication that the mn pair is coupled ferromagnetically .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate if some kind of relationship exists between @xmath67 and @xmath4 .",

    "[ fm_pair_3 ] . here",
    "a dominating hopping term @xmath68 gives rise to both a partially filled impurity band@xcite stabilizing the fm state , and a large acceptor splitting @xmath69 , which will also be approximately related to the exchange energy gained by the fm configuration . as we will see later ( following the discussion of fig .",

    "overall , the spectral weight maximum for a given pair in bulk is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding pair at the surface , with bulk wave functions that are much more spread out in the lattice .    as shown in the first two rows of fig .",
    "[ sldosfm ] , some bonding / antibonding characteristics in the acceptor wave functions can be seen for the closest pairs @xmath165 in the fm configuration , which exhibit magnetic quasi - easy planes . both acceptor wave functions for the @xmath166 mn pair exhibit a hint of antibonding character .",
    "note that this pair is characterized by the magnetic anisotropy landscape of a single mn impurity .    for @xmath136",
    "each acceptor level is occupying both mn sites , but a separation occurs for @xmath167 such that each acceptor has more pronounced ldos on one of the sites .",
    "the same association of acceptors spatially bound to one site , appears for the other directions - a pattern indicative of weak hybridization .",
    "finally the @xmath168 has some hint of bonding / antibonding pattern , but not as pronounced as for bulk .    in the ldos for the afm configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ sldosafm ] ) , the @xmath0 pairs show no spatial separation between the acceptors and no bonding / antibonding behavior .",
    "the @xmath169 has upper and lower acceptor wave functions that are localized to the separate mn sites , whereas the rest of the pairs are similar to the bulk counterparts ( see fig .",
    "[ bulkldosafm ] ) , but with a more localized ldos signature .",
    "finally , we have calculated the effective exchange constant for the mn pairs in the surface , which we compare with the calculated acceptor splittings .",
    "the fm splittings of the acceptor levels is shown in fig .",
    "[ surfsplit ] ( a ) .",
    "the very large splitting of 600 mev for the closest mn pair seen in experiment ( see fig .  [ splittings ] ) is now comparable to the calculated one of around 500 mev , when both acceptors are in the gap .",
    "the calculated splitting is small for the nearest @xmath170 .",
    "it then increases to around 100 mev for the @xmath86 , but after that splittings are very small and less than 50 mev , with the exception of the farthest @xmath0 . in the afm configurations , splittings are much larger at the surface compared to bulk . in particular , the closest @xmath86 has a large splitting of around 70 mev .",
    "this is expected , since a finite splitting in the afm configuration is possible when inversion symmetry is broken , an effect that is clearly enhanced by the presence of the surface .",
    "the fm surface splittings do not match the long range experimental trend as well as the bulk calculations . in our calculations ,",
    "we have accounted for the buckling of the gaas ( 110 ) surface , but not the detailed relaxation of mn environment .",
    "it is also not certain that the effective @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange model holds so well for the surface .",
    "not only the long range and short range coulomb may differ at the surface , but the exchange splitting is also subject to change .",
    "this is because the @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization scheme in fig .",
    "[ cartoon2 ] will be altered by the surface states .",
    "the surface @xmath106 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sjav ] . for the nearest @xmath0 pair , @xmath106 is strongly ferromagnetic and has a value similar to the corresponding pair in bulk .",
    "the @xmath1 pair has a very low @xmath106 of around half an mev and could easily become antiferromagnetic by a change in coulomb parameters .",
    "the so - induced anisotropy of @xmath4 on the unit sphere of magnetic moment directions is very weak , just fractions of an mev , due to the low anisotropy energies at the surface .",
    "interestingly the @xmath86 pair , which has a relatively large acceptor splitting of several tens mev in the afm configuration ( see fig .  [ surfsplit ] ) , is antiferromagnetic .",
    "as mentioned above , this is an effect entirely due to the surface , where a significant acceptor splitting can exist even for antiferromagnetically aligned mn spins and generate an energy gain that can compete with the fm configuration . the rest of the mn pairs shown in fig .",
    "[ sjav ] have a very small @xmath106 , indicating that the mn local moments interact very weakly due to the high degree of localization of the acceptor wave functions at the surface .",
    "the oscillatory behavior is indicative of friedel oscillations with a much shorter period than in bulk , which is connected to the strong localization of the acceptor wave functions at the surface .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the magnitude of @xmath106 ( disregarding the sign ) , follows the trend of the experimentally observed splittings , despite the fact that the calculated ones do not clearly do so . disregarding the single point @xmath146 in fig .",
    "[ surfsplit ] ( a ) , the experimental trend but with smaller magnitudes is reproduced .",
    "it is also interesting to note the large afm splitting for @xmath169 in fig .",
    "[ surfsplit ] ( a ) , which makes it difficult to distinguish from the fm configuration .",
    "there are however noticeable differences between the @xmath169 fm and afm ldos ( see figs .",
    "[ sldosfm ] and [ sldosafm ] ) .",
    "the fm acceptors each have spectral weight on both mn sites , but the afm acceptors are each associated with one site . given the large splitting between the afm acceptors , this observation could perhaps be tested experimentally .",
    "overall , it would appear that the experimental results for the ( 110 ) surface are intermediary to our surface and bulk calculations .",
    "in this paper we have investigated substitutional mn pairs in gaas , using a microscopic tight - binding model solved for large gaas clusters .",
    "the model accounts realistically for spin - orbit interactions and includes the kinetic - exchange @xmath2-@xmath3 coupling between the mn local magnetic moment and the spin of valence band electrons .",
    "one goal of this work was to assess whether or not this model can reproduce the main features of coupled acceptor states observed in recent stm experiments,@xcite and in this way further elucidate the nature of the effective exchange interaction between the two mn magnetic moments .",
    "when the two mn atoms are located in the bulk , we find that the ground state of the system is generally one in which the two mn magnetic moments are coupled ferromagnetically and aligned along the direction connecting the mn atoms . in the ferromagnetic configuration , the two topmost acceptor states are split , and their energy separation depends strongly on the mn pair orientation with respect to the gaas crystal structure and decreases with mn separation .",
    "in particular , the largest splitting ( @xmath171 mev ) is found for the mn pair oriented along the @xmath99 direction .",
    "for separations larger than three lattice constants , the splitting is below 20 mev .",
    "the splitting is the result of hybridization of degenerate acceptor states with identical spin character , giving rise to bonding and antibonding states .",
    "our calculated acceptor splittings are typically a factor of two smaller than the experimental values .",
    "coulomb correlation effects not included in our tight - binding approach could partly be responsible for the larger splittings .",
    "analysis of the ldos for the two acceptor states shows that these are mainly concentrated in the surroundings of the mn atoms ; for intermediate separations , when the splitting is sizable , the higher state and lower state are of the _ bonding _ and anti - bonding type respectively .",
    "these results are all consistent with experiment,@xcite indicating that the tb model correctly describes the electronic properties of the coupled acceptor states in gaas associated with the magnetic impurities .",
    "an important question that we have addressed here is whether or not the acceptor splitting , which is accessible by stm measurements , is directly related to the effective exchange coupling between the mn local moments .",
    "the present work demonstrates that , at least within the model considered here , this relationship is not very sharp : although both quantities decrease with separation and are typically anisotropic , the acceptor splitting displays a non - monotonic behavior for a few pair orientations which is not found in the exchange coupling . in our model ,",
    "the dependence of the latter on mn separation and pair orientation is better represented by the overall _ _ bandwidth__@xcite of the six impurity levels present in the gap ( see fig .  [ altmeas ] ) .",
    "in particular , our calculations demonstrate that exchange interactions between two mn ions in ( ga , mn)as are closely related to the splitting between the two acceptor levels that are occupied by holes and the four lower energy acceptor levels that are occupied by electrons .",
    "this splitting is not readily measured by stm experiments which are strongly influenced by coulomb interaction energies when the number of holes bound to the acceptor complex is increased above two by removing electrons from the system .",
    "it is possible that infrared spectroscopy of transitions between iso - charge levels of the acceptor complex could be more effective .",
    "these results support the idea that the stability and strength of the ferromagnetic coupling involves the hybridization of all impurity levels and not only the two topmost ones occupied by holes .",
    "our estimate of the exchange coupling is in qualitative agreement with results obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations , with a few noticeable discrepancies analyzed in detailed in sec .",
    "[ abinitio_comparison ] , which are most likely due to the limitations of both methods and deserve further investigation .",
    "when the two mn atoms are inserted in the @xmath157 surface as in experiment , we typically find much deeper acceptor states with strongly localized wave functions around the impurities .",
    "weaker hybridization causes the acceptor splitting to decay more rapidly with separation , although in a manner qualitatively similar to bulk . with the exception of the most closely spaced mn pair ,",
    "the surface acceptor splittings seem to agree less well with experiment than our bulk results . the exchange constant is likewise very small except at the shortest separations and can even change sign , favoring an antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "these results are a clear indication that our semiphenomenological microscopic model , derived mainly from bulk ( mn , ga)as properties , is not able to quantitatively capture the complexity of the surface states .",
    "this is an area that could benefit from additional work .",
    "the model investigated here makes predictions for the spin - orbit induced magnetic anisotropy for pairs of mn atoms in gaas .",
    "some of these predictions could be tested in stm experiments by applying an external field .",
    "when the mn pair is in a bulk environment , there is a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy along the axis of the pair with anisotropy barriers of 10 - 20 mev .",
    "when the pair is in a ( 110 ) surface , the behavior of the anisotropy energy landscape is for most pairs similar in character and magnitude to that of a single mn atom in the ( 110 ) surface.@xcite .    in the present approach the local moment degrees of freedom",
    "have been treated as classical variables .",
    "the study of the quantum spin dynamics of two interacting mn in gaas is an important and interesting subject both theoretically and in view of future experiments .",
    "work in this direction , based on berry - phase quantization of the semi - classical local moments considered here , is underway .",
