    "<S> we generalize the callan - harvey mechanism to the case of actions with a non local mass term for the fermions . using a @xmath0-dimensional model as a concrete example </S>",
    "<S> , we show that both the existence and properties of localized zero modes can also be consistently studied when the mass is non local . </S>",
    "<S> we derive some general properties from a study of the resulting integral equations , and consider their realization in a concrete example .    </S>",
    "<S> the callan - harvey mechanism  @xcite explains the existence and properties of fermionic zero modes that appear whenever the mass of a dirac field in @xmath1 dimensions ( @xmath2 ) has a domain - wall like defect . </S>",
    "<S> the zero modes due to this phenomenon are localized , concentrated around the domain wall , and chiral from the point of view of the domain - wall world - volume ( a @xmath3-dimensional theory ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism has found many interesting applications , both to phenomenological issues  @xcite and theoretical elaborations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical domain walls have been considered in  @xcite , and the case of a ( dynamical ) supersymmetric model with this kind of configuration has been discussed in  @xcite . remarkably , lattice versions of the zero modes , the so - called ` domain wall fermions '  @xcite have also been precursors of the overlap dirac operator  @xcite , a sensible way to put chiral fermions on a spacetime lattice .    in spite of the fact that the callan - harvey mechanism has been extended in many directions , </S>",
    "<S> the existence of chiral zero modes has been so far only studied for the case of _ local _ mass terms , namely , those where the mass is a local function of the spacetime coordinates . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we relax that condition and consider the case of a non local mass in @xmath0 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non trivial modification which does , however , arise naturally in some applications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when the fermionic action is dressed by quantum effects , the corrections usually adopt the form of non local form - factors .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first review the standard callan - harvey mechanism  @xcite when one considers a fermion field in 2 + 1 dimensions coupled to a domain wall like defect , with the ( euclidean ) action @xmath4 \\,\\psi \\;.\\ ] ] we use euclidean coordinates @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the euclidean time ) and @xmath7 where the @xmath8-matrices are chosen according to the convention :    @xmath9    the _ local _ mass @xmath10 contains a topological defect ; in the simplest case of a rectilinear static defect  @xcite , they have the characteristic shape : @xmath11 where @xmath12 . therefore the domain wall , which is the interface between two regions with different signs for @xmath10 , is the @xmath13 axis .    from the dirac operator @xmath14 we can construct the hermitian operator @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the form of @xmath16 suggests the introduction of the adjoint operators @xmath17 in terms of which @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> expanding @xmath22 in the complete set of eigenfunctions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , there appears  @xcite a massless left fermion , localized over the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> its @xmath25 dependence is dictated by the fact that it is a zero mode of the @xmath26 operator , and it dominates the low energy dynamics of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> we want to generalize this phenomenon to include a non local mass . </S>",
    "<S> namely , rather than ( [ eq : defdirac1 ] ) , the dirac operator shall be @xmath27 little can be said about the existence of a fermionic zero mode before we make some hypotheses to restrict the form of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the system has translation invariance in the coordinates @xmath29 and that @xmath28 consists of a local domain wall like part , plus a non local term with a strength controlled by a parameter @xmath30 : @xmath31    we are looking for a zero mode @xmath32 , so that : @xmath33 taking advantage of the translation invariance in @xmath34 , we use ` separation of variables ' to look for solutions of the form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a massless spinor , which is left - handed from the point of view of the two - dimensional world defined by @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 there is an essential difference regarding the space of solutions to the equations above in euclidean and minkowski spacetimes . indeed , in euclidean spacetime </S>",
    "<S> , it leads to analytic functions of @xmath39 , while in the minkowski case one has ` left - mover ' solutions . keeping this distinction in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we continue working with the euclidean version .    substituting ( [ eq : defpsi1 ] ) into ( [ eq : defzeromode1 ] ) and comparing with ( [ eq : dirac1.1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we arrive to a non local version of the kernel for the annihilation operator @xmath40 \\ , \\delta(x_2-y_2)- \\lambda \\ ; \\gamma_k ( x_2,y_2 ) \\;\\;.\\ ] ] the zero mode @xmath41 , must then satisfy the equation @xmath42 \\ </S>",

    "<S> the function @xmath47 , which modulates @xmath48 , must then satisfy the equation @xmath49 \\ ; \\varphi ( y_2)=0 \\;.\\ ] ] by integrating over @xmath25 , the previous equation can be written in a more convenient form as an integral equation @xmath50 where the kernel @xmath51 is @xmath52 this is a homogeneous integral equation , which can be conveniently rewritten as an equivalent non - homogeneous set of equations . indeed , introducing linear operators , ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be rewritten as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 we see that the problem can be discussed in terms of ( [ eq : fredholm2 ] ) , which is an inhomogeneous system of the fredholm type  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath56 has to be verified , of course , after solving ( [ eq : fredholm2 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this procedure is that , had we used the original homogeneous system , we should have had to introduce non compact operators , and the theory for this kind of operator is much poorer than for the compact case .    </S>",
    "<S> physical restrictions imposed on the non local mass naturally lead us to integral equations of the fredholm type  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ` fredholm alternative '  @xcite states that , if @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a compact operator on a hilbert space @xmath60 , then the following alternative holds : ( a ) either @xmath61 has only the trivial solution , in which case @xmath62 has a unique solution @xmath63 ; or ( b ) @xmath61 has @xmath64 linearly independent solutions @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath66 also has @xmath64 linearly independent solutions @xmath67 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 is solvable iff @xmath69 .    in the case </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) , the general non - homogeneous solution is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a particular solution and @xmath72 are arbitrary constants .    on the other hand , when the alternative ( a ) holds true , this implies that the solution shall be unique when @xmath57 is replaced by @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> solutions corresponding to @xmath74 are not solutions of the system : , , equivalent to the original homogeneous equation ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) , and may , therefore , be safely discarded .    </S>",
    "<S> any true solution of the system will also verify a subsidiary equation , obtained by setting @xmath75 in ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) : @xmath76 for any @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation shall be true whenever the equations @xmath78 , @xmath56 are both true ( since it is derived from them ) , and any solution will automatically verify it .    in our case , we want to study the effect of the non local term , the strength of which is controlled by the value of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> close enough to the local mass case , @xmath30 can be made arbitrarily small , so @xmath79 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath59 and consequently @xmath80 has only the trivial solution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if @xmath59 is a fredholm operator , ( [ eq : fredholm1 ] ) will have a unique solution . </S>",
    "<S> the functional space @xmath60 to which @xmath81 belongs is restricted by the condition @xmath82 because @xmath22 itself has to be normalizable . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes a hilbert space , and it contains the zero mode of the local operator ( @xmath83 ) , when the scalar product used in @xmath60 is the one defined by ( [ eq : hcond ] ) , namely , @xmath84^ * \\ , g(x_2 ) \\;.\\ ] ]    when fredholm s hypotheses are satisfied for a general kernel @xmath85 , it is possible to find a perturbative solution . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , writing @xmath86 and successively replacing @xmath87 by @xmath88 on the right hand side , we obtain the neumann series  @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 it can be shown  @xcite that the neumann series converges uniformly to the solution @xmath81 when @xmath92 ^ 2 \\ ; .\\ ] ] so choosing @xmath30 to satisfy ( [ eq : radiusconv ] ) , we are allowed to represent @xmath93 by the expansion @xmath94    to make the previous analysis more concrete , we consider now an example , based on a specific choice of both the local and non local parts of @xmath28 in ( [ eq : defnonlocalmass ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a natural generalization of the purely local mass case is to have and a @xmath95 which is ` strongly diagonal ' and symmetric in @xmath96 , i.e. : @xmath97\\delta_n ( x_2-y_2 ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is an approximation of dirac s delta : @xmath99 when @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath101 when @xmath100 , so that the non local term reduces to a local domain wall mass .    </S>",
    "<S> we adopt ` natural ' units such that @xmath102 , and study the particular case @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> regarding @xmath98 , we use a truncation of the one - dimensional completeness relation : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a complete set of functions . </S>",
    "<S> we chose @xmath106 to be the harmonic oscillator s eigenfunctions .    </S>",
    "<S> the normalized zero mode corresponding to the local part is @xmath107\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-e^{-2 } } } \\ , e^{-|x_2| } \\ ; , \\ ] ] and the corrected zero mode @xmath108 is then determined by @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the integral equation for @xmath47 becomes @xmath109 where @xmath110 \\,\\ ] ] @xmath111 \\ , e^{-|y_2| } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    from equations ( [ eq : radiusconv ] ) and ( [ eq : mucuad ] ) , we see that the neumann series converges , in this case , for @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we assume that @xmath113 , and calculate ( [ eq : integrequat ] ) perturbatively . since its expression in terms of analytic functions is not very illuminating , we present , in figure  [ varphicompact ] , the numerical results of the first two iterations , taking @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    </S>",

    "<S> we see that the corrected zero mode continues to be localized over the domain wall , although it is no longer a symmetric function of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , this perturbative method introduces only smooth corrections in the zero mode , as expected .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by summarizing that we have studied a generalization of the callan - harvey mechanism to the case of a non local mass in 2 + 1 dimensions , showing that for a certain set of assumptions about the non locality , there continues to exist a fermionic zero mode .    we have first considered a quite general non local term , deriving a linear integral equation for a function which modulates the zero mode of the local case , and accounts for the effect of the non local domain wall . considering a defect of finite size </S>",
    "<S> , the fredholm alternative theorem applies and there is a unique , localized chiral zero mode . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , perturbation theory may be applied to calculate it : for the concrete example of a strongly diagonal mass , we have calculated the first few terms in a perturbative expansion , showing that they lead to negligible modifications with respect to the local mass case . </S>"
