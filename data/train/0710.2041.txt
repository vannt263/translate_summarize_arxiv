    "for spacetime dimension @xmath0 the einstein  hilbert action of gravity admits quadratic corrections constructed from coordinate - invariant tensors which scale as fourth derivatives of the metric . in particular , when @xmath1 the most general theory leading to second order equations for the metric is the so - called einstein  gauss  bonnet theory or lovelock theory up to second order .",
    "this class of model for higher dimensional gravity has been widely studied , in particular because it can be obtained in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite . for spacetime dimensions @xmath2",
    "the gauss  bonnet terms in the action represent a topological invariant .",
    "the equations of gravitation admit solutions , known as lorentzian wormholes , which connect two regions of the same universe ( or of two universes ) by a throat , which is a minimal area surface @xcite .",
    "such kind of geometries would present some features of particular interest , as for example the possibility of time travel ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . but",
    "a central objection against the actual existence of wormholes is that in einstein gravity the flare - out condition @xcite to be satisfied at the throat requires the presence of exotic matter , that is , matter violating the energy conditions @xcite . in this sense , thin - shell wormholes have the advantage that the exotic matter would be located only at the shell .",
    "however , it has recently been shown @xcite that in pure gauss  bonnet gravity exotic matter is no needed for wormholes to exist ; in fact , they could exist even with no matter ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work",
    "we thus study thin - shell wormholes in einstein  gauss  bonnet gravity .",
    "we focus in the amount of matter necessary for supporting the wormholes , without analyzing the microphysics explaining this matter .",
    "differing from the approach in the related work ref .",
    "@xcite , where the gauss  bonnet terms were treated as an effective source for the einstein s field equations , here the gauss  bonnet contribution is treated as an essentially geometrical object .",
    "this requires a generalization @xcite of the darmois ",
    "israel formalism @xcite for thin shells , but provides a better physical understanding . in particular , we show that for certain values of the parameters , thin - shell wormholes could be supported by matter not violating the energy conditions .",
    "we start from the action for einstein  maxwell  gauss  bonnet theory in a five - dimensional manifold @xmath3 with cosmological constant @xmath4 and maxwell field @xcite : @xmath5 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is related with the newton constant , @xmath7 is the gauss  bonnet term , and @xmath8 is the gauss  bonnet coupling constant .",
    "the gauss  bonnet constant introduces a scale @xmath9 in the theory which physically represents a short - distance correction to general relativity . within string theory , in five dimensions @xmath8 would be of order the string mass scale ; but in a more general framework @xmath8 can be considered as an arbitrary real number with the appropriate dimensions .",
    "the field equations resulting from the action ( [ action ] ) are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the second order lovelock tensor and @xmath12 is the usual electromagnetic energy - momentun tensor : @xmath13 @xmath14 equations ( [ field ] ) admit a spherically symmetric solution given by @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16.\\label{f}\\ ] ] it is easy to check that in the limit @xmath17 the five - dimensional einstein ",
    "maxwell solution with cosmological constant is recovered .",
    "further , in this limit and for @xmath18 the five - dimensional reissner ",
    "nrdstrom metric is obtained , so @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be indentified with the mass and the charge of the system . for @xmath21 ,",
    "there is , in principle , a minimun value of the radial coordinate @xmath22 such that the function under the square root in ( [ f ] ) is positive so the metric ( [ metric ] ) is well defined .",
    "the geometry has a curvature singularity at the surface defined by @xmath23 .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters @xmath24 , this singular surface can be surrounded by an event horizon with a radius @xmath25 , so the metric ( [ metric ] ) represents a black hole ; if no event horizont exists , it presents a naked singularity . here",
    "we will focus in the case of null cosmological constant ; the singularity in the metric from which we start would present a singularity at @xmath22 given by the greatest real and positive solution of the equation @xmath26 if eq .",
    "( [ r6 ] ) has no real positive solutions we have @xmath27 , where the metric diverges .",
    "on the other hand , when horizons exist their radii are given by @xmath28^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] so there exits a critical value of the charge : @xmath29 such that if @xmath30 there would exist two horizons , if @xmath31 there would exist only one ( degenerate ) horizon , and if @xmath32 there are no horizons .",
    "the event horizont would be placed at @xmath33 , and @xmath34 would correspond to the inner horizon . if @xmath35 the singularity would be shielded by the event horizon , but if @xmath36 we would have a naked singularity .",
    "starting from the metric given by ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ f ] ) with @xmath37 we build a spherically symmetric thin - shell wormhole in the einstein  maxwell  gauss  bonnet theory .",
    "we take two copies of the spacetime and remove from each manifold the five - dimensional regions described by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is chosen to include possible singularities or horizons within the regions @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting manifolds have boundaries given by the timelike hypersurfaces @xmath41 then we identify these two timelike hypersurfaces to obtain a geodesically complete new manifold @xmath42 with a matter shell at the surface @xmath43 , where the throat of the wormhole is located .",
    "this manifold without singularities or horizons is constituted by two asymptotically flat regions . to study this type of wormhole",
    "we apply the darmois ",
    "israel formalism generalized @xcite to the case of einstein gauss  bonnet theory .",
    "we can introduce the coordinates @xmath44 in @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the proper time on the throat . though we will focus mainly in static configurations ,",
    "in the general case we could allow the radius of the throat be a function of the proper time , so that the boundary hypersurface reads : @xmath47 the field equations projected on the shell @xmath45 ( generalized darmois ",

    "after some algebraic manipulation , the non - null components @xmath57 of the energy - momentun tensor of the shell are obtained as @xmath58,\\label{sigma}\\ ] ] @xmath59,\\label{p}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; the dot means a derivative with respect to the proper time and the prime with respect to @xmath39 . from these equations we read the energy density @xmath62 and the tranverse pressure @xmath63 in terms of the throat radius @xmath64 , first and second derivatives of @xmath64 and the function @xmath65 wich depends on the parameters of the system .",
    "if we take @xmath66 in both equations ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ p ] ) we recover the expression for the energy density @xmath67 and pressure @xmath68 found in ref .",
    "@xcite with the standard lanczos equation for the shell .",
    "furthermore , taylor expanding up to zeroth order in @xmath8 we recover the expressions for the five - dimensional schwarzschild and reissner ",
    "nrdstrom cases . starting from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ p ] ) , in the next section we will show that for certain values of the parameters , ordinary matter could support thin - shell wormholes in einstein  gauss  bonnet theory .",
    "motivated by the results within pure gauss  bonnet gravity ( i.e. without einstein term ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we evaluate the amount of exotic matter and the energy conditions , following the approach presented above in which the gauss  bonnet term is treated as a geometrical contribution in the field equations . coming this contribution from the curvature tensor ,",
    "this approach is clearly the most suitable to give a precise meaning to the characterization of matter supporting the wormhole .",
    "as we shall see , the results will considerably differ from those in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the gauss  bonnet term was treated as an effective source for the einstein s field equations .",
    "the _ weak energy condition _",
    "( wec ) states that for any timelike vector @xmath69 it must be @xmath70 ; the wec also implies , by continuity , the _ null energy condition _",
    "( nec ) , which means that for any null vector @xmath71 it mus be @xmath72 @xcite . in an orthonormal basis",
    "the wec reads @xmath73 , @xmath74 , while the nec takes the form @xmath75 . in the case of thin - shell wormholes",
    "the radial pressure @xmath76 is zero , while within einstein gravity or even with the inclusion of a gauss  bonnet term in the way proposed in @xcite , the surface energy density must fulfill @xmath77 , so that both energy conditions would be violated",
    ". the sign of @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the transverse pressure is not fixed , but it depends on the values of the parameters of the system .    in what follows we restrict to static configurations . the surface energy density @xmath80 and the transverse pressure @xmath81 for a static configuration ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) are given by @xmath85,\\label{s0}\\ ] ] @xmath86.\\label{p0}\\ ] ] note that the sign of the surface energy density is , in principle , not fixed .",
    "the most usual choice for quantifying the amount of exotic matter in a lorentzian wormhole is the integral @xcite : @xmath87 we can introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath88 with @xmath89 corresponding to each side of the shell .",
    "then , because in our construction the energy density is located on the surface , we can write @xmath90 , and because the shell does not exert radial pressure the amount of exotic matter reads @xmath91 replacing the explicit form of @xmath80 and @xmath92 , we obtain the exotic matter amount as a function of the parameters that characterize the configurations : @xmath93,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is given by ( [ f ] ) . for @xmath18 ,",
    "in the limit @xmath66 and taylor expanding up to zeroth order we obtain the exotic matter for the reissner ",
    "nrdstrom ( @xmath95 ) and schwarzschild ( @xmath96 ) geometries .    for @xmath21",
    "we now find that there exist positive contributions to @xmath97 ; these come from the different signs in the expression ( [ s0 ] ) for the surface energy density , because @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "we stress that this would not be possible if the standard darmois  israel formalism was applied , treating the gauss  bonnet contribution as an effective energy - momentum tensor , because this leads to @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "now , once the explicit form of the function @xmath94 ( with @xmath18 ) is introduced , the condition @xmath100 leads to @xmath101 which can hold only for @xmath102 .",
    "the subsequent analysis is simplified by considering the case @xmath103 ; then there would be at most only one horizon in the original manifold , its radius being independent of the charge .",
    "but for this charge it can be shown that , for values of @xmath8 such that the horizon exists , it is not possible to fulfil eq .",
    "( [ s+ ] ) for any wormhole radius larger than @xmath25 ; the reason is that the horizon exists only for @xmath104 , which is not compatible with condition ( [ s+ ] ) if @xmath105 is to be larger than the corresponding horizon radius .",
    "instead , a simple numerical analysis shows that for @xmath8 slightly below @xmath106 both the singularity at @xmath107 and the horizon dissapear in the original manifold , so that the only condition to be fulfilled is that given by eq .",
    "( [ s+ ] ) . and for @xmath102 it is always possible to choose @xmath105 such that this indeed happens , so that the existence of thin - shell wormholes is compatible with a positive surface energy density .",
    "slightly below @xmath108 the same happens for larger @xmath109 . ]    in figures 1 and 2 we show the amount @xmath97 as a function of the wormhole radius for this relatively large value of @xmath109 ( that is , @xmath110 of order @xmath111 ) ; though this would imply microscopic configurations or a scenario different from that suggested by present day observation , the analysis shows that this is the most interesting situation . besides the fact that @xmath97 results to be smaller when calculated by treating the gauss  bonnet contribution as a geometric object than in the case that it was treated as an effective energy - momentum tensor , this amount is smaller than which would be necessary in the five - dimensional pure reissner  nrdstrom case ( see fig .",
    "however , the central , remarkable , result is that we have a region with @xmath112 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , corresponding to @xmath100 ; and that besides , from eqs .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) we have @xmath113 , which shows that for wormhole radii such that @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( @xmath116 within the maximun and the zero of @xmath98 in fig .",
    "3 ) both the wec and the nec are satisfied . thus , in the picture providing a clear meaning to matter in the shell , in einstein  gauss",
