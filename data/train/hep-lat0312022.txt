    "the @xmath6 yang - mills theory has a @xmath16 center symmetry @xcite that is spontaneously broken at high temperatures .",
    "the corresponding order parameter is the polyakov loop @xcite whose expectation value @xmath17 determines the free energy @xmath18 of a static quark as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath19 . in the low - temperature confined phase the center symmetry is unbroken , i.e.   @xmath20 , and",
    "hence the free energy of a single static quark is infinite . in the high - temperature deconfined phase , on the other hand ,",
    "the center symmetry is spontaneously broken , i.e.  @xmath21 , and the free energy of a quark is finite . if the deconfinement phase transition is second order , its long - range physics is dominated by fluctuations in the polyakov loop order parameter . in this case",
    "the details of the underlying dynamics become irrelevant and only the center symmetry and the dimensionality of space determine the universality class . as was first pointed out by svetitsky and yaffe , for an @xmath6 yang - mills theory in @xmath22 space - time dimensions the effective theory describing the fluctuations of the order parameter",
    "is a @xmath2-dimensional @xmath16-symmetric scalar field theory for the polyakov loop @xcite . for recent reviews on this subject",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath0-dimensional @xmath4 yang - mills theory the center symmetry is @xmath5 and",
    "hence the effective theory is a @xmath2-dimensional @xmath5-symmetric scalar field theory for the real - valued polyakov loop .",
    "the simplest theory in this class is a @xmath23 theory with the euclidean action @xmath24 = \\int d^dx \\ \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } { \\partial}_i \\phi { \\partial}_i \\phi + v(\\phi)\\right].\\ ] ] the scalar potential is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 for stability reasons .",
    "indeed , for @xmath27 this theory has a second order phase transition in the universality class of the @xmath2-dimensional ising model .",
    "however , this does not guarantee that the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath4 yang - mills theory is also second order .",
    "in particular , one could imagine that the effective potential @xmath28 also involves a @xmath29 term which is marginally relevant in three dimensions .",
    "then the coefficient @xmath30 has to be positive in order to ensure that the potential is bounded from below , but the coefficient @xmath31 of the @xmath23 term can now become negative . then the phase transition becomes first order .",
    "for @xmath32 there is a tricritical point at which the order of the phase transition changes .",
    "still , this does not happen in @xmath33-d @xmath4 yang - mills theory , where  using lattice simulations  it has indeed been shown that the deconfinement phase transition is second order @xcite and has the same critical exponents as the 3-d ising model @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath14-d @xmath4 yang - mills theory has a second order deconfinement phase transition @xcite in the universality class of the 2-d ising model @xcite .    for @xmath7 , the effective theory for",
    "a @xmath0-dimensional @xmath6 yang - mills theory with the center @xmath16 should be a @xmath2-dimensional @xmath16-symmetric scalar field theory for the complex - valued polyakov loop @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "hence , this term can not appear in the effective action .    for @xmath37 the cubic term in the action @xmath38 breaks the @xmath39 symmetry of the quadratic and quartic terms down to @xmath40 . for @xmath3 ,",

    "the absence of universal behavior in 3-d @xmath40-symmetric models suggests that the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath41 yang - mills theory should also be first order .",

    "stronger fluctuations lead to a second order phase transition in the universality class of the 2-d 3-state potts model @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath42 case .",
    "for @xmath43 the @xmath44-symmetric scalar potential leads to a second order phase transition in the universality class of the 3-d @xmath44-symmetric chiral clock model which corresponds to two decoupled ising models .",
    "however , the deconfinement phase transition of @xmath33-d @xmath45 yang - mills theory does not seem to fall into that universality class .",
    "it is inconvenient to study the deconfinement phase transition in lattice simulations of @xmath45 yang - mills theory due to a first order bulk phase transition at zero temperature .",
    "the existing lattice data show that the deconfinement transition is first order @xcite . again , in @xmath14-d @xmath45 yang - mills theory stronger fluctuations seem to induce a second order phase transition @xcite .    for @xmath46 , depending on the values of the various parameters in the potential @xmath47",
    ", the phase transition can again be first or second order . in case of a second order phase transition",
    ", the corresponding scalar field theory should be in the universality class of the @xmath16-symmetric chiral clock model which , for @xmath3 , happens to be the one of the @xmath39-symmetric xy - model @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath46 , the discrete @xmath16 symmetry is not visible at the critical point and is , in fact , dynamically enhanced to a continuous @xmath39 symmetry",
    ". this should not be too surprising .",
    "in particular , for @xmath48 the term @xmath49 which breaks the @xmath39 symmetry of the other terms down to @xmath16 is irrelevant in three dimensions . however , again numerical simulations  in this case of @xmath50 and @xmath51 yang - mills theory @xcite  indicate a first order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "this suggests that all @xmath33-d @xmath6 yang - mills theories with @xmath7 have a first order deconfinement phase transition without universal behavior .",
    "in particular , the universality arguments of @xcite then apply only to the @xmath4 case , not to @xmath7 or to the @xmath52 limit .",
    "it should be mentioned that other arguments may suggest a second order phase transition at large @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask if svetitsky and yaffe s universality arguments can be applied beyond @xmath4 yang - mills theory , along another direction in the space of lie groups . in particular , since @xmath53 , one can ask if @xmath54 yang - mills theories show universal behavior at their deconfinement phase transitions .",
    "numerical studies of @xmath33-d @xmath55 gauge theory are complicated by a bulk phase transition in which the lattice theory sheds off its @xmath5 center monopole lattice artifacts @xcite . beyond this phase transition , in the continuum limit",
    ", one would expect @xmath55 and @xmath4 yang - mills theories to be equivalent .",
    "lattice studies of the deconfinement phase transition of @xmath55 yang - mills theory @xcite are consistent with this expectation .    in order to avoid complications due to lattice artifacts , it is best to work with the universal covering group of @xmath54 which is @xmath56 .",
    "for example , @xmath57 .",
    "the center of @xmath56 is @xmath5 for odd @xmath10 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and @xmath44 for @xmath60 .",
    "let us first discuss the family of @xmath56 with odd @xmath10 and center @xmath5 .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath57 which we already discussed .",
    "since @xmath61 , this is a case that we will concentrate on later in this paper .",
    "in contrast to @xmath62 , for @xmath3 , we find a first order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "we are unaware of numerical lattice studies of @xmath56 yang - mills theories with @xmath48 .",
    "next , we consider @xmath56 with @xmath59 and center @xmath63 . now the simplest case is @xmath64 .",
    "a @xmath65 lattice yang - mills theory with the standard wilson action factorizes into two @xmath4 yang - mills theories .",
    "hence , its deconfinement phase transition is in the universality class of two decoupled ising models .",
    "the next case in this family is @xmath66 which has not been studied numerically .",
    "the last family is @xmath56 with @xmath60 with the center @xmath44",
    ". then the simplest case is @xmath67 .",
    "as we already discussed , lattice simulations have shown that in @xmath33-d @xmath45 yang - mills theory the deconfinement phase transition is first order . although this need not necessarily be the case for larger @xmath10 , due to the increasing number of gauge degrees of freedom we expect @xmath33-d @xmath56 gauge theories to have first order transitions for all @xmath46 .",
    "there is a last possible direction in the space of lie groups which we explore in this paper .",
    "this is the sequence of symplectic lie groups @xmath8 which are simply connected and hence are their own universal covering groups .",
    "this sequence has the center @xmath5 for all @xmath10 and includes @xmath9 .",
    "the groups @xmath8 are pseudo - real and thus provide a natural extension of @xmath4 to larger @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath6 , the study of @xmath8 yang - mills theories allows us to change the size of the group without changing the center .",
    "hence , we can investigate the order of the deconfinement phase transition as a function of the size of the gauge group , keeping the available ising universality class fixed .",
    "in fact , we will argue that the order of the phase transition is controlled by the size of the gauge group and not by the center symmetry .",
    "our studies of @xmath33-d @xmath11 and @xmath15 yang - mills theories show that a first order phase transition arises although the 3-d ising universality class is available .",
    "the order of the phase transition is a dynamical issue which does not simply follow from the center symmetry .",
    "the lie groups larger than @xmath4 have many generators and thus give rise to a large number of deconfined gluons .",
    "the number of confined glueball states , on the other hand , is essentially independent of the gauge group .",
    "hence , there is a drastic change in the number of relevant degrees of freedom on the two sides of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "this can induce the abrupt changes in thermodynamical quantities that are characteristic for a first order phase transition .",
    "this suggests that the deconfinement phase transition of @xmath33-d @xmath8 yang - mills theory is first order for all @xmath68 . in @xmath13 dimensions we find that stronger fluctuations drive the phase transition of @xmath11 yang - mills theory second order .",
    "due to the larger number of gauge degrees of freedom , @xmath14-d @xmath15 yang - mills theory still has a first order phase transition .",
    "we expect this to be the case for all @xmath7 .    for completeness ,",
    "let us also discuss the exceptional lie groups @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 that do not fall in the main sequences @xmath6 , @xmath56 , or @xmath8 . the groups @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath73 have a trivial center and thus need not have a deconfinement phase transition at all .",
    "in fact , recently we have argued that @xmath69 yang - mills theory should only have a crossover between its low- and high - temperature regimes @xcite . the group @xmath71 has the center @xmath40 . just as in the @xmath41 case",
    ", a @xmath33-d @xmath71 yang - mills theory is expected to have a first order deconfinement phase transition because no universality class with @xmath40 symmetry seems to exist in three dimensions .",
    "however , even for @xmath14-d @xmath71 yang - mills theory , where the 2-d 3-state potts model universality class is available , we expect a first order phase transition due to the large size of @xmath71 ( which has rank 6 and 78 generators ) . finally , @xmath72 has the center @xmath5 .",
    "if the deconfinement phase transition of @xmath72 yang - mills theory is second order , it should hence have ising critical exponents .",
    "however , for a group as large as @xmath72 ( with rank 7 and 133 generators ) the large number of gauge degrees of freedom again suggests a first order deconfinement phase transition .    also taking into account the numerical results for the various small lie groups , the arguments from above",
    "lead us to conjecture that , in @xmath12 dimensions , only @xmath4 and its trivial extension @xmath74 yang - mills theories have a second order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "all other yang - mills theories are expected to have a first order phase transition ; possible exceptions are yang - mills theories with gauge group @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath73 which have a trivial center and may hence just have a crossover . in that case , in @xmath12 dimensions svetitsky and yaffe s universality arguments apply only to @xmath4",
    ".    in @xmath13 dimensions stronger fluctuations arise and may result in a second order phase transition .",
    "indeed , for @xmath14-d @xmath11 yang - mills theory we find a second order phase transition . in agreement with svetitsky and yaffe s arguments",
    ", a finite - size scaling analysis shows critical behavior in the 2-d ising universality class .",
    "for the first time , this confirms the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture beyond @xmath6 . for @xmath14-d @xmath15 yang - mills theory , on the other hand , the transition is first order .",
    "this is again consistent with the increasing number of gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , in @xmath13 dimensions we expect the transition to be first order for all @xmath7 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "basic properties of @xmath8 groups are reviewed .",
    "section 3 introduces @xmath8 yang - mills theory on the lattice , including heatbath and overrelaxation algorithms for its numerical simulation .",
    "evidence for a first order deconfinement phase transition is reported for both @xmath11 and @xmath15 yang - mills theory in @xmath12 dimensions and for @xmath15 in @xmath13 dimensions .",
    "a finite - size scaling analysis of the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath14-d @xmath11 yang - mills theory shows that it is second order and in the universality class of the 2-d ising model .",
    "we also study the static quark potential in @xmath33-d @xmath11 yang - mills theory using the multi - level algorithm introduced by lscher and weisz @xcite .",
    "the resulting string tension is used to express the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition in physical units .",
    "finally , section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "summaries of this work have already appeared in @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath8 is a subgroup of @xmath75 which leaves the skew - symmetric matrix @xmath76 invariant . here",
    "@xmath77 is the @xmath78 unit - matrix and @xmath79 is the imaginary pauli matrix .",
    "the elements @xmath80 that belong to the subgroup @xmath8 satisfy the constraint @xmath81 consequently , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are related by the unitary transformation @xmath84 .",
    "hence the @xmath85-dimensional fundamental representation of @xmath8 is pseudo - real .",
    "the matrix @xmath84 itself also belongs to @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that in @xmath8 yang - mills theory charge conjugation is just a global gauge transformation .",
    "this property is familiar from @xmath9 yang - mills theory .",
    "indeed , matrices that obey the constraint eq.([pseudoreal ] ) form a group because for @xmath86 we have @xmath87 the inverse @xmath88 also obeys the constraint because @xmath89 and obviously the unit - matrix also belongs to @xmath8 .",
    "the constraint eq.([pseudoreal ] ) implies the following form of a generic @xmath8 matrix @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are complex @xmath78 matrices .",
    "since @xmath82 must still be an element of @xmath75 , these matrices must satisfy @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of @xmath82 come in complex conjugate pairs . since center elements are multiples of the unit - matrix , in this case eq.([group ] ) immediately implies @xmath95 .",
    "hence , the center of @xmath8 is @xmath5 .",
    "writing @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a hermitean traceless matrix , eq.([pseudoreal ] ) implies that the generators @xmath97 of @xmath8 satisfy the constraint @xmath98 this relation leads to the following generic form , @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are @xmath78 matrices .",
    "the hermiticity condition @xmath102 implies @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "note that , since @xmath100 is hermitean , @xmath97 is automatically traceless .",
    "the hermitean @xmath78 matrix @xmath100 has @xmath105 degrees of freedom and the complex symmetric @xmath78 matrix @xmath101 has @xmath106 degrees of freedom .",
    "hence the dimension of the group @xmath8 is @xmath107 .",
    "there are @xmath10 independent diagonal generators of the maximal abelian cartan subgroup .",
    "hence the rank of @xmath8 is @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath108 case is equivalent to @xmath4 , while the @xmath109 case is equivalent to @xmath110 , or more precisely to its universal covering group @xmath111 .",
    "since @xmath11 has rank 2 , the weight diagrams of its representations can be drawn in a 2-d plane .",
    "the weight diagrams of the fundamental representation @xmath112 , the @xmath110 vector representation @xmath113 , and the adjoint representation @xmath114 are depicted in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "in this section we consider @xmath8 yang - mills theory on the lattice .",
    "first , we discuss the action , the measure , and important observables .",
    "then we describe the simulation techniques and present results of numerical computations .",
    "the construction of @xmath8 yang - mills theory on the lattice is straightforward .",
    "the link parallel transporter matrices @xmath115 are group elements in the fundamental @xmath116 representation .",

    "the partition function then takes the form @xmath119),\\ ] ] where the path integral measure @xmath120 is a product of local haar measures of the group @xmath8 for each link .",
    "both the action and the measure are invariant under gauge transformations @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath123 is the trace of a path ordered product of link variables along a loop wrapping around the periodic euclidean time direction . here",
    "@xmath124 is the extent of the lattice in euclidean time , which determines the temperature @xmath125 in lattice units .",
    "the lattice action is invariant under global @xmath5 center symmetry transformations @xmath126 while the polyakov loop changes sign , i.e.  @xmath127 .",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop is given by @xmath128).\\ ] ] here @xmath129 is the spatial lattice volume , again in lattice units .",
    "as a consequence of the @xmath5 center symmetry , with periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions the expectation value of the polyakov loop always vanishes , i.e.  @xmath20 , even in the deconfined phase .",
    "this is simply because spontaneous symmetry breaking  in the sense of a non - vanishing order parameter  does not occur in a finite volume .",
    "alternatively , one may say that the expectation value of the polyakov loop vanishes because the presence of a single static quark is incompatible with the gauss law on a torus @xcite .",
    "since it always vanishes , on a finite torus the expectation value of the polyakov loop does not contain any useful information about confinement or deconfinement . in the finite - size scaling analysis",
    "presented below we therefore consider the expectation value of the magnitude of the polyakov loop @xmath130 .",
    "this quantity is always non - zero in a finite volume , but vanishes in the confined phase in the infinite volume limit .",
    "furthermore , using the polyakov loop , one can define its probability distribution @xmath131),\\ ] ] which does indeed allow one to distinguish confined from deconfined phases . in the confined phase @xmath132 has a single maximum at @xmath133 , while in the deconfined phase it has two degenerate maxima at @xmath134 .",
    "if the deconfinement phase transition is first order , the confined and the two deconfined phases coexist and one can simultaneously observe three maxima close to the phase transition . at a second order phase transition , on the other hand , the high- and low - temperature phases become indistinguishable .",
    "the two maxima of the deconfined phase then merge and smoothly turn into the single maximum of the confined phase .",
    "three coexisting maxima then do not occur in a large volume .    in a pure glue theory",
    "another quantity of physical interest is the static quark potential @xmath135 .",
    "note that , since the fundamental representation of @xmath8 is pseudo - real , in @xmath8 gauge theories quarks and anti - quarks are indistinguishable . at any temperature",
    ", @xmath135 can be derived from the 2-point correlation function of the polyakov loop @xmath136 in the zero - temperature limit , @xmath137 , at large distances @xmath138 the static quark potential is linearly rising , @xmath139 with the slope given by the string tension @xmath140 . at finite temperature @xmath141 measures the free energy of a static quark pair at the distance vector @xmath142 .",
    "the string tension is a temperature - dependent function which decreases with increasing temperature . in the deconfined phase it vanishes and the potential levels off .    as physical quantities that are useful in the finite - size scaling analysis presented below we also introduce the polyakov loop susceptibility @xmath143 as well as the binder cumulant @xcite @xmath144 the susceptibility measures the strength of fluctuations in the order parameter while the binder cumulant measures the deviation from a gaussian distribution of those fluctuations .",
    "we also consider the specific heat which takes the form @xmath145 in a finite volume @xmath146 has a maximum close to the critical coupling @xmath147 of the infinite volume theory .",
    "we denote the value of the specific heat at the maximum by @xmath148 .",
    "another interesting observable is the latent heat @xmath149 which measures the difference of the expectation values of the action in the confined and the deconfined phase .",
    "note that this quantity is defined only at the phase transition in the infinite volume limit .",
    "it vanishes for a second order phase transition and is non - zero for a first order transition . even in a finite ( but sufficiently large ) volume , @xmath150 can be evaluated in a monte carlo simulation because  up to very rare tunneling events  every configuration can be unambiguously associated with the confined or the deconfined phase . in the large volume limit ,",
    "the latent heat and the maximum of the specific heat are related by @xcite @xmath151      the @xmath8 lattice yang - mills theory with the standard wilson action can be simulated with heat - bath @xcite and microcanonical overrelaxation @xcite algorithms similar to the ones for @xmath6 .",

    "again due to its large number of generators , and despite its center @xmath5 , we expect @xmath72 yang - mills theory to have a first order transition .",
    "the remaining exceptional groups @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath73 have a trivial center and thus need not have a deconfinement phase transition at all . for @xmath69 we expect just a crossover , but we can not rule out a first order phase transition .",
    "consequently , only for @xmath169 and for its trivial extension @xmath170 the transition is second order and in the 3-d ising universality class .",
    "svetitsky and yaffe s universality arguments do not apply to the other yang - mills theories in @xmath12 dimensions .    in @xmath14 dimensions",
    "a few yang - mills theories have a second order deconfinement phase transition : they include those with @xmath11 , @xmath65 , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath41 @xcite , and , perhaps , @xmath45 @xcite gauge groups .",
    "it remains to be seen if other @xmath14-d yang - mills theories with gauge group @xmath56 with @xmath172 or @xmath6 with @xmath46 belong on this list .",
    "due to the large size of these groups we find this unlikely .",
    "for example , @xmath15 and @xmath168 have 21 and @xmath173 has 24 generators .",
    "since we find @xmath14-d @xmath15 yang - mills theory to have a first order deconfinement phase transition , we expect the same for @xmath56 with @xmath48 and for @xmath6 with @xmath46 .",
    "our results suggest that the size of the gauge group  and not the center symmetry  determines the order of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "this should not be too surprising .",
    "the larger lie groups have many generators and thus give rise to a large number of deconfined gluons .",
    "the number of confined glueball states , on the other hand , is essentially independent of the gauge group . for a large gauge group",
    "the drastic change in the number of relevant degrees of freedom on the two sides of the deconfinement phase transition may easily drive it first order .",
