    "in this article , we discuss a graph - based approach for testing spatial point patterns . in statistical literature , the analysis of spatial point patterns in natural populations has been extensively studied and have important implications in epidemiology , population biology , and ecology .",
    "we investigate the patterns of one class with respect to other classes , rather than the pattern of one - class with respect to the ground .",
    "the spatial relationships among two or more groups have important implications especially for plant species .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our goal is to test the spatial pattern of complete spatial randomness against spatial segregation or association .",
    "complete spatial randomness ( csr ) is roughly defined as the lack of spatial interaction between the points in a given study area .",
    "segregation is the pattern in which points of one class tend to cluster together , i.e. , form one - class clumps . in association , the points of one class tend to occur more frequently around points from the other class . for convenience and generality ,",
    "we call the different types of points as  classes \" , but the class can be replaced by any characteristic of an observation at a particular location . for example , the pattern of spatial segregation has been investigated for species ( @xcite ) , age classes of plants ( @xcite ) and sexes of dioecious plants ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use special graphs called proximity catch digraphs ( pcds ) for testing csr against segregation or association . in recent years , @xcite introduced a random digraph related to pcds ( called class cover catch digraphs ) in @xmath3 and extended it to multiple dimensions .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite demonstrated relatively good performance of it in classification . in this article , we define a new class of random digraphs ( called pcds ) and apply it in testing against segregation or association .",
    "a pcd is comprised by a set of vertices and a set of ( directed ) edges .",
    "for example , in the two class case , with classes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the @xmath4 points are the vertices and there is an arc ( directed edge ) from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , based on a binary relation which measures the relative allocation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with respect to @xmath5 points . by construction , in our pcds , @xmath4 points further away from @xmath5 points will be more likely to have more arcs directed to other @xmath4 points , compared to the @xmath4 points closer to the @xmath5 points .",
    "thus , the relative density ( number of arcs divided by the total number of possible arcs ) is a reasonable statistic to apply to this problem . to illustrate our methods ,",
    "we provide three artificial data sets , one for each pattern .",
    "these data sets are plotted in figure [ fig : deldata ] , where @xmath5 points are at the vertices of the triangles , and @xmath4 points are depicted as squares .",
    "observe that we only consider the @xmath4 points in the convex hull of @xmath5 points ; since in the current form , our proposed methodology only works for such points .",
    "hence we avoid using a real life example , but use these artificial pattern realizations for illustrative purposes . under segregation ( left ) the relative density of our pcd will be larger compared to the csr case ( middle ) , while under association ( right ) the relative density will be smaller compared to the csr case .",
    "the statistical tool we utilize is the asymptotic theory of @xmath0-statistics . properly scaled ,",
    "we demonstrate that the relative density of our pcds is a @xmath0-statistic , which have asymptotic normality by the general central limit theory of @xmath0-statistics .",
    "the digraphs introduced by @xcite , whose relative density is also of the @xmath0-statistic form , the asymptotic mean and variance of the relative density is not analytically tractable , due to geometric difficulties encountered . however , the pcd we introduce here is a parametrized family of random digraphs , whose relative density has tractable asymptotic mean and variance .",
    "ceyhan and priebe introduced an ( unparametrized ) version of this pcd and another parametrized family of pcds in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite used the domination number ( which is another statistic based on the number of arcs from the vertices ) of the second parametrized family for testing segregation and association .",
    "the domination number approach is appropriate when both classes are comparably large .",
    "@xcite used the relative density of the same pcd for testing the spatial patterns .",
    "the new parametrized family of pcds we introduce has more geometric appeal , simpler in distributional parameters in the asymptotics , and the range of the parameters is bounded .    using the delaunay triangulation of the @xmath5 observations",
    ", we will define the parametrized version of the proximity maps of @xcite in section [ sec : tau - factor - pcd ] for which the calculations regarding the distribution of the relative density are tractable .",
    "we then can use the relative density of the digraph to construct a test of complete spatial randomness against the alternatives of segregation or association which are defined explicitly in sections [ sec : spat - pattern ] and [ sec : null - and - alt ] .",
    "we will calculate the asymptotic distribution of the relative density for these digraphs , under both the null distribution and the alternatives in sections [ sec : asy - norm - null ] and [ sec : asy - norm - alt ] , respectively .",
    "this procedure results in a consistent test , as will be shown in section [ sec : consistency ] .",
    "the finite sample behaviour ( in terms of power ) is analyzed using monte carlo simulation in section [ sec : monte - carlo ] .",
    "the pitman asymptotic efficiency is analyzed in section [ sec : pitman ] .",
    "the multiple - triangle case is presented in section [ sec : mult - tri ] and the extension to higher dimensions is presented in section [ sec : ncs - higher - d ] .",
    "all proofs are provided in the appendix .",
    "for simplicity , we describe the spatial point patterns for two - class populations .",
    "the null hypothesis for spatial patterns have been a controversial topic in ecology from the early days ( @xcite ) .",
    "but in general , the null hypothesis consists of two random pattern types : complete spatial randomness or random labeling .    under _ complete spatial randomness _",
    "( csr ) for a spatial point pattern @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the area functional , we have    * given @xmath12 events in domain @xmath13 , the events are an independent random sample from a uniform distribution on @xmath13 ; * there is no spatial interaction .",
    "furthermore , the number of events in any planar region with area @xmath14 follows a poisson distribution with mean @xmath15 , whose probability mass function is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the intensity of the poisson distribution .    under _ random labeling _",
    ", class labels are assigned to a fixed set of points randomly so that the labels are independent of the locations .",
    "thus , random labeling is less restrictive than csr . but",
    "conditional on a set of points from csr , both processes are equivalent .",
    "we only consider a special case of csr as our null hypothesis in this article .",
    "that is , only @xmath18 points are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the convex hull of @xmath19 points .",
    "the alternative patterns fall under two major categories called _ association _ and _ segregation_. _ association _ occurs if the points from the two classes together form clumps or clusters .",
    "that is , association occurs when members of one class have a tendency to attract members of the other class , as in symbiotic species , so that the @xmath20 will tend to cluster around the elements of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , in plant biology , @xmath4 points might be parasitic plants exploiting @xmath5 points .",
    "as another example , @xmath4 and @xmath5 points might represent mutualistic plant species , so they depend on each other to survive . in epidemiology",
    ", @xmath5 points might be contaminant sources , such as a nuclear reactor , or a factory emitting toxic gases , and @xmath4 points might be the residence of cases ( incidences ) of certain diseases caused by the contaminant , e.g. , some type of cancer .",
    "_ segregation _ occurs if the members of the same class tend to be clumped or clustered ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many different forms of segregation are possible .",
    "our methods will be useful only for the segregation patterns in which the two classes more or less share the same support ( habitat ) , and members of one class have a tendency to repel members of the other class .",
    "for instance , it may be the case that one type of plant does not grow well in the vicinity of another type of plant , and vice versa .",
    "this implies , in our notation , that @xmath20 are unlikely to be located near any elements of @xmath5 .",
    "see , for instance , ( @xcite ) . in plant biology",
    ", @xmath5 points might represent a tree species with a large canopy , so that , other plants ( @xmath4 points ) that need light can not grow around these trees . as another interesting but contrived example , consider the arsonist who wishes to start fires with maximum duration time ( hence maximum damage ) , so that he starts the fires at the furthest points possible from fire houses in a city .",
    "then @xmath5 points could be the fire houses , while @xmath4 points will be the locations of arson cases .",
    "we consider _ completely mapped data _ ,",
    "i.e. , the locations of all events in a defined space are observed rather than sparsely sampled data ( only a random subset of locations are observed ) .",
    "in general , in a random digraph , there is an arc between two vertices , with a fixed probability , independent of other arcs and vertex pairs .",
    "however , in our approach , arcs with a shared vertex will be dependent .",
    "hence the name _ data - random digraphs_.    let @xmath21 be a measurable space and consider a function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the power set of @xmath24 .",
    "then given @xmath25 , the _ proximity map _ @xmath26 associates",
    "a _ proximity region _",
    "@xmath27 with each point @xmath28 .",
    "the region @xmath29 is defined in terms of the distance between @xmath30 and @xmath5",
    ".    if @xmath31 is a set of @xmath24-valued random variables , then the @xmath32 , are random sets . if the @xmath20 are independent and identically distributed , then so are the random sets , @xmath33 .",
    "define the data - random proximity catch digraph @xmath13 with vertex set @xmath34 and arc set @xmath35 by @xmath36 where point @xmath20  catches \" point @xmath37 .",
    "the random digraph @xmath13 depends on the ( joint ) distribution of the @xmath20 and on the map @xmath38 .",
    "the adjective _ proximity _  for the catch digraph @xmath13 and for the map @xmath38  comes from thinking of the region @xmath29 as representing those points in @xmath24 `` close '' to @xmath30 ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the _ relative density _ of a digraph @xmath39 of order @xmath40 ( i.e. , number of vertices is @xmath12 ) , denoted @xmath41 , is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the set cardinality functional ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath41 represents the ratio of the number of arcs in the digraph @xmath13 to the number of arcs in the complete symmetric digraph of order @xmath12 , namely @xmath44 .    if @xmath45 , then the relative density of the associated data - random proximity catch digraph @xmath13 , denoted @xmath46 , is a u - statistic , @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the indicator function .",

    "the methodology is similar to the one given by @xcite .",
    "however , the results are simplified by deliberate choices we make .",
    "for example , among many possibilities , the proximity map is defined in such a way that the distribution of the domination number and relative density is geometry invariant for uniform data in triangles , which allows the calculations on the standard equilateral triangle rather than for each triangle separately . in various fields , there are many tests available for spatial point patterns . an extensive survey is provided by kulldorff who enumerates more than 100 such tests , most of which need adjustment for some sort of inhomogeneity ( @xcite ) .",
    "he also provides a general framework to classify these tests .",
    "the most widely used tests include pielou s test of segregation for two classes ( @xcite ) due to its ease of computation and interpretation and ripley s @xmath331 and @xmath332 functions ( @xcite ) .    the first proximity map similar to the @xmath65-factor proximity map @xmath103 in literature is the spherical proximity map @xmath333 ; see , e.g. , @xcite . a slight variation of @xmath334 is the arc - slice proximity map @xmath335 where @xmath336 is the delaunay cell that contains @xmath30 ( see ( @xcite ) )",
    "furthermore , ceyhan and priebe introduced the ( unparametrized ) central similarity proximity map @xmath337 in ( @xcite ) and another family of pcds in ( @xcite ) .    the spherical proximity map @xmath334 is used in classification in the literature , but not for testing spatial patterns between two or more classes .",
    "we develop a technique to test the patterns of segregation or association .",
    "there are many tests available for segregation and association in ecology literature .",
    "see ( @xcite ) for a survey on these tests and relevant references .",
    "two of the most commonly used tests are pielou s @xmath338 test of independence and ripley s test based on @xmath331 and @xmath332 functions . however , the test we introduce here is not comparable to either of them .",
    "our test is a conditional test  conditional on a realization of @xmath245 ( number of delaunay triangles ) and @xmath296 ( the set of relative areas of the delaunay triangles ) and we require the number of triangles @xmath245 is fixed and relatively small compared to @xmath339 .",
    "furthermore , our method deals with a slightly different type of data than most methods to examine spatial patterns .",
    "the sample size for one type of point ( type @xmath4 points ) is much larger compared to the the other ( type @xmath5 points ) .",
    "this implies that in practice , @xmath5 could be stationary or have much longer life span than members of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , a special type of fungi might constitute @xmath4 points , while the tree species around which the fungi grow might be viewed as the @xmath5 points .",
    "the sampling structure for our asymptotic analysis is infill asymptotics ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , our statistic that can be written as a @xmath0-statistic based on the locations of type @xmath18 points with respect to type @xmath19 points .",
    "this is one advantage of the proposed method : most statistics for spatial patterns can not be written as @xmath0-statistics .",
    "the @xmath0-statistic form avails us the asymptotic normality , once the mean and variance is obtained by detailed geometric calculations .",
    "the null hypothesis we consider is considerably more restrictive than current approaches , which can be used much more generally . in particular",
    ", we consider the completely spatial randomness pattern on the convex hull of @xmath5 points .",
    "based on the asymptotic analysis and finite sample performance of relative density of @xmath65-factor central similarity pcd , we recommend large values of @xmath65 ( @xmath240 ) should be used , regardless of the sample size for segregation . for association , we recommend large values of @xmath65 ( @xmath240 ) for small to moderate sample sizes , and small values of @xmath65 ( @xmath340 ) . however , in a practical situation , we will not know the pattern in advance .",
    "so as an automatic data - based selection of @xmath65 to test csr against segregation or association , one can start with @xmath97 , and if the relative density is found to be smaller than that under csr ( which is suggestive of association ) , use any @xmath341 $ ] for small to moderate sample sizes ( @xmath342 ) , and use @xmath343 ( say @xmath280 ) for large sample sizes @xmath344 .",
    "if the relative density is found to be larger than that under csr ( which is suggestive of segregation ) , then use large @xmath65 ( any @xmath345 $ ] ) regardless of the sample size .",
    "however , for large @xmath65 ( say , @xmath345 $ ] ) ) , @xmath97 has more geometric appeal than the rest , so it can be used when large @xmath65 is recommended .",
    "although the statistical analysis and the mathematical properties related to the @xmath65-factor central similarity proximity catch digraph are done in @xmath241 , the extension to @xmath304 with @xmath305 is straightforward . moreover , the geometry invariance , asymptotic normality of the @xmath0-statistic and consistency of the tests hold for @xmath330 .    throughout the article , we avoid to provide a real life example , because the procedure in its current form ignores the @xmath18 points outside the convex hull of @xmath19 points ( which is referred as the _ boundary influence _ or _ edge effect _ in ecology literature ) .",
