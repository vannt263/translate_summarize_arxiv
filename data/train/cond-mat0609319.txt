    "<S> we consider orientational transitions of lamellar phases under the influence of a spatially nonuniform electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between parallel and perpendicular lamellar stackings with respect to the substrate is investigated as a function of the system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectrophoretic energy and the energy penalty for having dielectric interfaces perpendicular to the field s direction are identified as linear and quadratic terms in a free energy expansion in the dielectric constant mismatch . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if the dielectric constant mismatch @xmath0 is smaller than some critical value @xmath1 , parallel lamellar stacking will be realized , no matter how large the voltage difference between electrodes is . at @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> perpendicular stacking will appear if the voltage is high enough . </S>",
    "<S> nonuniform fields remove the in - plane degeneracy present in the more common uniform fields . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore calculate the energy of grains of different orientations . </S>",
    "<S> the torque acting on the grains leads to the preference of only one orientation . </S>",
    "<S> the results have direct implications to block copolymer orientation and to surface patterning on the nanometer scale .    </S>",
    "<S> * introduction*. in recent years we have seen a large effort directed toward finding ways to control the phase - behavior and orientation of self - assembled structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> confinement between two solid surfaces @xcite , shear flow @xcite , or the use of external electric fields @xcite have proved very useful . </S>",
    "<S> the use of electric fields is especially appealing , as the field strength scales favorably with the system size . </S>",
    "<S> spatially uniform electric fields , however , pose a long - lasting problem since the orientation of the assembled phases is not unique  the symmetry of the field means that all grain rotations in the plane are energetically equivalent .        </S>",
    "<S> spatially varying fields remove this degeneracy , and thus can be quite useful in alignment of various mesophases </S>",
    "<S> . the early experiments of russell _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have employed nonuniform fields , but ever since then all research have been on uniform fields . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that now , when such spatially uniform fields have been well understood and exploited possibly to their full potential , it is time to come back to spatially varying fields . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the most simple periodic structure  the lamellar phase , which is found under the influence of an electric field emanating from a `` razor - blade '' electrode design ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lamellae are made up of two different materials , a and b , e.g. , diblock copolymers . in this example , the two polymers a and b have different dielectric constants , @xmath3 and @xmath3 . in the following we assume ion - free polymers </S>",
    "<S> ; alternatively , for ion - containing polymers , application of a quasi - static field in the frequency @xmath4 khz renders the ions immobile but leaves the electrostatic equations unchanged @xcite . in spatially uniform electric fields , the lowest - order contribution to the system </S>",
    "<S> electrostatic free energy is quadratic in the permittivity difference of the two constituents , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> as is explained in detail below , an inhomogeneity of the field gives rise to a dielectrophoretic force which is manifested in a linear term in @xmath0 , and this has significance to the orientation selection and to phase - transitions @xcite .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> it should also be pointed out that nonuniform electric fields are in general neither interfacial nor purely bulk ones . in the razor - blade geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the field is high close to the electrodes edge . </S>",
    "<S> however , sufficiently far from the electrodes the field behaves like @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance from the middle of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the integrated electrostatic contribution to the energy scales like @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this energy indeed decays , but very slowly , and it has an important contribution even very far from the electrodes .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the lamellae are rigid enough so that the electric field does not bend them . in the example of block copolymers </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to the so - called strong - segregation regime , where @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> let us verify the validity of this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic bending energy per unit volume is written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bending modulus , and @xmath12 is the local bending radius ( inverse curvature ) . </S>",
    "<S> for strongly stretched lamellae , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lamellar period ( @xmath15 nm ) and @xmath16 mn / m is the a / b interfacial tension . on the other hand , the electrostatic energy per unit volume is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the dielectric constant and @xmath19 the local field , which can not exceed @xmath20 v/@xmath21 m because of dielectric breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> let us take this maximum value , in this case @xmath22 j / m@xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath24 if the lamellae are bent with a radius of curvature of @xmath25 m . </S>",
    "<S> the same estimate relates to the stresses ( forces ) of course . </S>",
    "<S> electric fields can not bend lamellae to a radius smaller than @xmath26 m . in the razor - blade system , at larger distances from the electrodes the field is weaker , and </S>",
    "<S> therefore the lamellae should stay flat as well . since the fields we consider are typically much weaker </S>",
    "<S> , we do not expect bent lamellae in this electrode arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> the above reasoning does not hold for weakly segregated lamellae : these lamellae have a much weaker modulus @xmath11 and therefore significant bending can occur .    </S>",
    "<S> a lamellar stack can therefore have the basic configurations : parallel or perpendicular to the substrate ( fig . 1 ( b ) and ( c ) ) </S>",
    "<S> , denoted as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the parallel stacking the first layer at the substrate is half as thick as the others . a third state exists which we denote the perpendicular defect . here </S>",
    "<S> the lamellae normals are not parallel to the electrodes edges . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( d ) represents the highest energy of such defects . </S>",
    "<S> weakly segregated systems exhibit lower energy defects , e.g. , t - junction or grain boundary . in some experiments with weakly segregated block copolymers on preferential surfaces </S>",
    "<S> , few lamellar layers are adsorbed preferentially on the substrate ( mixed morphology ) due to the long - range effect of surface ordering @xcite . as is mentioned above , this system is out of the scope of the current work , and it will be dealt with in a subsequent publication .    </S>",
    "<S> a peculiar feature of nonuniform fields is that the @xmath27 state can be favored over the @xmath28 one even in the absence of specific interfacial interactions with the substrate . in order to understand this , consider first the distribution of electric field squared for two semiinfinite planar electrodes in the @xmath29@xmath30 plane , with a gap of @xmath31 @xmath21 m between them . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is shown in fig . 2 for a medium with spatially uniform dielectric constant @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly @xmath32 is very high close to the surface and , in particular , close to the electrodes edge at @xmath33 @xmath21 m . </S>",
    "<S> the field is small far from the substrate , and therefore interfacial instabilities are not expected @xcite ; this is true even more so since above the electrodes edges the field at @xmath34 is actually parallel to the substrate and also to the polymer / air interface .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now assume without loss of generality that @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> as is well - known in the field of dielectrophoretic forces @xcite , a material with large value of @xmath18 is drawn to regions with high fields , whereas small-@xmath18 material is repelled . </S>",
    "<S> since the electric field is largest near the electrodes edges , an @xmath27 state can form with the a - material touching the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> however , the work of amundson _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> has shown that there is also a free energy penalty for having dielectric interfaces perpendicular to the field s direction , and this penalty is absent in the @xmath28 state . clearly , the orientation selection depends on the magnitude of @xmath36 .        </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic energy of the system is given by an integral over all space , @xmath37 the dielectric constant @xmath38 is a spatially varying quantity . in this study </S>",
    "<S> it is a periodic function . in the @xmath27 state , for example , it is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average dielectric constant , and the period is @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the above equation simply represents a square - wave in the @xmath42-direction , where @xmath18 alternates between @xmath43 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric constant can be defined similarly for the other stackings .   </S>",
    "<S> + * theory and results*. figure 3 shows @xmath44 for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 stackings at a fixed value of @xmath45 and varying values of the dielectric constant mismatch . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic energy is calculated numerically for a system with electrode gap of @xmath46 m . @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> ( dashed horizontal line ) is constant for the @xmath28 case , because the electric field between the electrodes is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath48 . on the other hand , in the @xmath27 case ( solid line ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath47 decreases first before it increases . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease is due to the dielectrophoretic term , linear in @xmath0 , while the increase is due to the penalty associated with dielectric interfaces perpendicular to the field lines , scaling like @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us make a short but very general mathematical digression which will clarify the last point . </S>",
    "<S> denote @xmath50 the electric field which corresponds to a system of uniform dielectric constant and a given electrode design ( not necessarily the one in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 is derived from a potential @xmath52 satisfying the proper boundary conditions on the electrodes : @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose now that the dielectric constant changes from its average value by an amount @xmath54 : @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this change in permittivity leads to a change in field : @xmath56 . we may now write the integrand of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fes ] ) in the following way : @xmath57\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac12\\left[2{\\varepsilon}_1{\\bf e}_0\\cdot{\\bf e}_1+\\bar{{\\varepsilon}}{\\bf e}_1 ^ 2\\right]-\\frac12{\\varepsilon}_1{\\bf e}_1 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right is the electrostatic energy of the system with uniform average @xmath18 , while the other three terms are the deviations from it . </S>",
    "<S> the second and third terms ( square brackets ) are the dielectrophoretic and `` dielectric interfaces '' terms , scaling like @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the last term scales like @xmath60 , and is small if @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> for the case where this last term is dealt with the interested reader is referred to @xcite .        on the basis of this expansion and denoting @xmath62 , one can easily show that @xmath63 obeys the following equation @xmath64 with the boundary conditions that @xmath65 on all conductors . </S>",
    "<S> clearly @xmath63 can be written as @xmath66 , where geometry refers to the electrode geometry and @xmath67 to the electrode potential difference ( in the case of just two electrodes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we now write @xmath58 in a form that puts emphasis on dimensions : @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath69 is a dimensionless function containing the spatial variation of @xmath58 , and whose spatial average vanishes : @xmath70 . for the square - wave example of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sq_wave ] ) , @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> it then directly follows that @xmath72        where @xmath73 obeys the equations @xmath74 and @xmath75 on all electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath73 is a universal potential independent of @xmath0 , @xmath63 is linear in @xmath76 ( and in fact it is linear in @xmath67 as well ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly we find @xmath77 , with @xmath78 independent of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we now rewrite eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fes_exp ] ) as follows :    @xmath79~{\\rm d}^3r\\nonumber\\\\ i_2&=&-\\frac12\\int\\left[2c({\\bf r } ) { \\bf e}_0\\cdot{\\bf \\tilde{e}}_1+{\\bf \\tilde{e}}_1 ^ 2\\right ] ~{\\rm d}^3r\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expansion of @xmath44 is now transparent to order @xmath49 , as both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are independent of @xmath0 , are quadratic in @xmath82 , and depend on geometry and @xmath69 . in order to further demystify the above expansion , </S>",
    "<S> consider the simple one - dimensional example of uniform electric field @xmath83 ( parallel - plate capacitor ) , with @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case we find @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and since @xmath86 we find a rather well - known result : @xmath87 e_0 ^ 2+const$ ] .        </S>",
    "<S> we now return to the razor - blade electrode design and the results presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the descent of @xmath44 for parallel lamellae is due to a negative value of @xmath80 , stemming from the dielectrophoretic force . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent increase at larger value of @xmath0 is due to a positive @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical value of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is given by the relation @xmath88 the existence of @xmath1 is indeed important  </S>",
    "<S> at all @xmath89 the morphology is that of parallel layers ( @xmath27 ) , _ irrespective of the applied voltage _ or the magnitude of the electric field . in uniform electric fields similar critical value of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> does not exist . the value of the last term ignored in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fes_exp ] ) is numerically verified to be negligible in this calculation .        in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we plot @xmath44 as a function of @xmath0 for the perpendicular - defect state sketched in fig . 1 ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> at a given voltage and @xmath0 , this state has the highest electrostatic energy since the two electrostatic terms are unfavorable  the electrodes are not covered with the high-@xmath18 material ( @xmath90 ) , and the field lines cross the lamellar interfaces ( @xmath91 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 depicts a lamellar grain in a defect state : the lamellae normals are not parallel to the electrodes edges . </S>",
    "<S> the highest energy rotation has @xmath92 , while the lowest is the @xmath28 state with @xmath93 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 we present the electrostatic energy @xmath44 as a function of the rotation angle @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the torque acting on the sample to orient it in the preferred direction is given as the derivative : @xmath95 ; it vanishes for the two extreme cases @xmath93 and @xmath92 @xcite . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath51 is uniform in space we find @xmath96\\sin^2(\\theta)$ ] . as is seen in the figure , the actual energy is higher than this estimate .        </S>",
    "<S> finally , the interfacial interaction of the two materials with the substrate can be taken into account as well . </S>",
    "<S> let us call @xmath97 and @xmath98 the interfacial energies per unit area of the a and b materials with the surface , respectively . the free energy difference between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 states is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the substrate area . </S>",
    "<S> the prevailing state is @xmath27 if @xmath101 is negative and @xmath28 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of this free energy difference , one can construct a phase diagram , which is shown in fig . 7 for two values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> note that both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are proportional to @xmath82 , and since @xmath2 , the electric field terms favor the perpendicular stacking . for fixed interfacial interactions , raising the voltage from small values to large ones </S>",
    "<S> destabilizes the @xmath27 and leads to perpendicular stacking @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical voltage for this transition scales like @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> the polymer melt can be confined by another solid surface from the top . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there are two more @xmath103 and @xmath104 corresponding to the second surface , and the augmented version of the equation above reads @xmath105 where the `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' subscripts refer to the bottom and top surface respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here we have assumed that the film is sufficiently thick so that the incommensurability between the lamellar thickness and the surface separation can be neglected and the parallel lamellae are not frustrated , as is the case for surface separation larger than @xmath106 lamellae .     + * conclusions*. lamellar phases under the influence of a spatially nonuniform electric field are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the dielectric constant mismatch @xmath0 is highlighted : the linear term in the free energy expansion is due to a dielectrophoretic force , while the quadratic term includes the free energy penalty for having dielectric interfaces perpendicular to the field s direction . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that a simple electrode realization which gives rise to nonuniform fields can bring about orientational transitions between several lamellar stackings . specifically , for @xmath89 , parallel lamellae are preferred over perpendicular ones even at very high voltages . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 , there is an interplay between electrostatic forces and interfacial interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the `` razor - blade '' electrode design suggested here can find numerous applications in nanotechnology : the large torque is expected to remove the degeneracy between the @xmath28 states by orienting the lamellae perpendicular to the substrate and the electrodes edges . </S>",
    "<S> more complex morphologies are expected to occur for block copolymers in the intermediate and weak segregations where the lamellar bending and grain boundary energies are smaller , and these systems should be systematically explored in this and more advanced electrode arrangements . </S>"
