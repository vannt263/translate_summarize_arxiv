    "the last three decades of observational surveys of pre - main - sequence stars have resulted in the measurement of rotation periods and/or rotational velocities ( @xmath3 ) of thousands of stars ( see reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the analysis of these data have revealed a number of mysteries regarding the spin rates of young stars .",
    "perhaps the most prominent of these mysteries is that which was first noted by @xcite . specifically , a large fraction of nearly solar mass pre - main - sequence stars rotate much more slowly than expected .",
    "the fact that stars are built up from material with high specific angular momentum , and that these young stars are still contracting , leads to the expectation of a rotation rate near the breakup velocity .",
    "solar mass stars with ages less than a few myr have rotation periods typically in the range of 110 days but with a tail in the distribution extending to around 20 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the statistics show that about half of these stars are indeed fairly rapid rotators and do seem to spin up as they approach the main sequence @xcite . however , roughly half of the stars younger than a few myr rotate at about 10% or less of breakup speed @xcite .",
    "thus , there is some mechanism operating that is capable of removing significant amounts of angular momentum during the pre - main - sequence phase .    following the suggestion of @xcite , the modeling work of @xcite and @xcite showed that the observed range of spins could be reproduced reasonably well , by assuming that the presence of an accretion disk somehow results in a constant stellar spin period of around one week .",
    "there is some observational evidence that the population of stars with disks on average rotate more slowly than those without disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , the idea that the angular spin rate is held at a constant by the presence of the disk is loosly based on physical models for the interaction between a star and surrounding disk .",
    "there are generally two prominent theoretical ideas for how accreting stars can maintain a slow spin rate .",
    "one idea is that the torques arising from the magentic connection between the star and disk can remove substantial angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when these torques are strong enough to enforce an equilibrium stellar spin rate , this idea is generally referred to as `` disk locking '' @xcite .",
    "the other idea to explain slowly rotating accretors is that powerful stellar winds are primarily responsible for removing angular momentum from the star @xcite .",
    "numerical , dynamical simulations of the star - disk interaction ( such as the investigations of spin equilibrium by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically exhibit significant torques arising both from the magnetic star - disk connection and from winds .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to further examine the possibility of disk locking as an explanation for the slow rotation of young stars . to this end , we develop a model for the time - evolution of stellar spin rates , under the influence of magnetic star - disk interaction torques . in this work ,",
    "we neglect the influence of stellar winds , as is customary in the disk - locking models .",
    "there are generally two types of disk locking models .",
    "one is the x - wind model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model is developed under the assumption that the star - disk system on average exists in a spin equilibrium state , in which the accreting star feels no torque .",
    "thus , the x - wind model can not be used to address whether or how the system reaches this equilibrium , nor how the system behaves when out of equilibrium ( e.g. , due to variability or due to the evolution of the star or disk ) .",
    "all other disk locking models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are of the second type , based on the general picture developed by @xcite for accreting neutron stars .",
    "the ghosh & lamb model provides a method for calculating the torque on the star , due to the star - disk interaction , for any state of the system .",
    "the star may spin up or down , depending on conditions , and there is a hypothetical disk - locked state , in which the net torque on the star is zero .",
    "thus , the ghosh & lamb model can be used to compute the evolution of accreting star spins and to assess how far from equilibrium a system may be .",
    "* hereafter cc93 ) , @xcite , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ac96 ) computed the evolution of pre - main - sequence star spins , adopting a ghosh & lamb - type model for torques on the star , and also including stellar contraction , a decrease in accretion rate with time , and a prescription for the evolution of the magnetic field . for parameters that reasonably represent t tauri stars , their models produced spin rates within the observed range .",
    "these models also showed that , regardless of the initial spin of the star , the spin rates rapidly ( in less than @xmath4  myr ) approached an equilibrium value and stayed near equilibrium during the first few myr of evolution .",
    "that is , the initial spin conditions were `` erased , '' and the stellar spin was `` locked '' to a rate that depended only on the stellar mass and radius , magnetic field strength , and accretion rate .",
    "these results generally supported the idea that disk locking explains the slow rotation of accreting t tauri stars .",
    "however , since that work , it has been recognized that there is a serious theoretical problem with a key assumption of the classical ghosh & lamb torque model .",
    "the assumption is that the stellar magnetic field lines connect to a large region of the disk and become highly twisted in the azimuthal direction .",
    "this twisting is what gives rise to the magnetic spin - down torque felt by the star .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have now shown that , when the dipole field is twisted azimuthally past a threshold of approximately @xmath5 , the magnetic pressure associated with the azimuthal component pushes the field outward .",
    "this leads to an inflation and opening of the field loops in a stellar rotation timescale , ultimately disconnecting the star from the disk .",
    "@xcite developed a method for computing which magnetic field lines would open .",
    "the amount of field opening depends primarily on how strongly coupled the magnetic field is to the disk , since the coupling is responsible for the twisting , and the twisting is responsible for the field opening .    in order to assess how the field opening affects the torques , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mp05 ) modified the ghosh & lamb formulation to include the effects of field opening , following the method of @xcite .",
    "mp05 showed that , for the relatively strong coupling expected in these systems , the opening of the field significantly reduces the spin - down torque on the star , relative to the classical assumption of a closed field .",
    "thus , the equilibrium spin rate predicted by the disk locking picture is much faster , which calls into question whether disk locking can explain the existence of slowly rotating accretors .",
    "however , since the mp05 model could only calculate the torque for a given set of parameters ( at a given epoch ) , their conclusion is based on the calculation of the equilibrium spin rate .",
    "mp05 were not able to describe how the spin evolves in time .",
    "therefore , there is a question as to whether the the stars actually evolve near equilibrium , and whether the evolution of the system , including changes in the accretion rate , stellar radius , and stellar spin rate may affect this conclusion .",
    "also , it is important to develop a physical model for understanding the evolution of stellar spin over a range of ages . for these reasons , in this paper , we develop and utilize a stellar spin evolution model ( similar to cc93 ; ac96 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that includes the updated torque theory of mp05 .",
    "in this first effort , we do not attempt to explain all phenomena related to young star spins . rather , we focus on testing whether models can produce spin rates within the observed typical range of @xmath610 days .",
    "this work extends the mp05 formulation to the time domain , during the first @xmath7 yr ( i.e. , during the hayashi phase ) .",
    "section [ sec_model ] contains a description of the model and details of our calculations .",
    "section [ sec_results ] contains the results of stellar spin calculations that include the effect of magnetic field opening . a discussion and summary of the conclusions of this work are contained in section [ sec_conclusion ] . as a test of the model , and for illustrative purposes , we include an appendix containing the results of stellar spin calculations under the classical assumption of a completely closed field .",
    "the goal of the present work is to determine the effect of different star - disk interaction torques on the evolution of the spin rates of young accreting stars . for this purpose ,",
    "in addition to calculating the torques , it is necessary to follow the evolution of the stellar mass ( @xmath8 ) , radius ( @xmath9 ) , and moment of inertia , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the normalized radius of gyration .",
    "this section describes the complete model , assumptions , and adopted parameters .",
    "all of our models follow a one solar mass protostar as it evolves along the hayashi ( fully convective ) track , before the formation of a radiative core .",
    "the `` birthline '' age of a one solar mass star is @xmath12  yr @xcite , which corresponds to the youngest ages at which stars are observed . to allow the system some time to respond to the initial conditions , we begin our computation at a somewhat earlier time of @xmath13  yr .",
    "we follow the evolution until an age of three million years , which is approximately the end of the hayashi track phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the torques acting on the star ( detailed in  [ sec_sdint ] ) arise from the interaction between the star and a surrounding accretion disk . as far as this interaction",
    "is concerned , one of the most important properties of the surrounding disk is the accretion rate . specifically , this is the rate at which matter is fed into the interaction region ( within a distance of several @xmath9 ) , which we also assume is the rate at which material accretes onto the stellar surface . to follow the decrease of the accretion rate in time , we adopt an exponential decay ( also used by cc93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the decay timescale and @xmath16 is the `` disk mass , '' equal to the total amount of mass that would accrete from time @xmath17 .",
    "we adopt @xmath18 yr , for all models .",
    "figure [ fig_mdot ] shows the evolution of the accretion rate , given by equation ( [ eq_mdot ] ) . in all of our models , we consider two different disk masses , @xmath19 and 0.01 @xmath20 , to sample a range of accretion rates .",
    "we chose these two disk masses to represent a relatively high and low accretion rate , shown as a red and black solid line in figure [ fig_mdot ] , respectively .",
    "the true accretion histories of young stars are likely to be much more complex than equation ( [ eq_mdot ] ) , but this is not yet well - understood .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that it is simple , and it samples the wide range of accretion rates that is observed in optically visible accreting young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig_mstar ] shows the evolution of the stellar mass , which only depends on the prescribed accretion rate ( eq .  [ [ eq_mdot ] ] ) and an initial condition ( at @xmath21 yr ) . for each of the two different accretion rates considered here , we set the initial stellar mass such that the final mass equals one solar mass . that is , the initial stellar mass equals one solar mass minus @xmath16 , corresponding to 0.9 and 0.99 @xmath20 for the two cases .      for the evolution of stellar radius ,",
    "we adopt the simple treatment of cc93 and @xcite .",
    "this treatment models the structure of the star as a polytrope with an index of @xmath22 and assumes a constant photospheric temperature , @xmath23 , during the hayashi phase .",
    "the polytropic model results in a mean radius of gyration of @xmath24 .",
    "the radiated , blackbody luminosity of the star is powered only by the release of gravitational potential energy , as the star contracts and accretes matter .",
    "the evolution of the stellar radius is then given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is newton s grativational constant and @xmath27 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the black and red solid lines in figure [ fig_rstar ] show the evolution of stellar radius with time , resulting from equations ( [ eq_mdot ] ) and ( [ eq_rstar ] ) . in all of our models",
    ", we adopted an initial stellar radius of @xmath28 and a photospheric temperature of @xmath29 k. we chose these values in order to best match the radius evolution of a one solar mass star ( with z=0.02 ) predicted by the more sophisticated stellar model of @xcite . also , the chosen value of @xmath23 is within the narrow range of ( nearly constant ) hayashi track temperatures exhibited by the @xcite model . for comparison ,",
    "the circles in the figure show the @xcite model predictions .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig_rstar ] that there is a `` bump '' in the siess et al .  radius evolution from @xmath6@xmath30  yr that is not matched by our model",
    "this is due to deuterium burning , which we neglect .",
    "still , our simple treatment matches the siess et al .",
    "model at the begining and end of the evolution , demonstrating that the overall evolution of stellar radius during this phase is dominated by the kelvin - helmholz contraction .",
    "thus , our simple treatment is sufficient for the present purpose .",
    "also , the treatment of equation ( [ eq_rstar ] ) captures the effects of mass accretion , which is neglected in more sophisticated models ( with the exception of * ? ? ?",
    "to compute the evolution for a longer time , beyond the hayashi track , would require the use of a more sophisticated stellar model , which we leave for future work .      along with the prescription above for the evolution of the star s mass , radius , and moment of inertia",
    ", the model also computes the angular momentum evolution . assuming the star rotates as a solid body",
    ", the angular momentum equation can be expressed in terms of spin evolution , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angular velocity of the star , and @xmath33 is the net torque on the star , discussed in section [ sec_sdint ] .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to express the spin rate as a fraction of the breakup speed , defined as the keplerian velocity at the star s equator .",
    "this normalized spin rate is defined @xmath34 in all of our models , we will consider two cases with different initial spin rates .",
    "the two cases have initial fractional spin rates of @xmath35 and 0.06 , representing the two extremes of rapid and slow initial rotation . in all of our models ,",
    "we enforce a maximum spin rate of @xmath36 , since at this spin rate , some of the model assumptions ( e.g. , regarding the stellar structure ) break down . as we show below , this limit is only reached in some of the most extreme models .      to calculate the torque on the star arising from accretion and the magnetic interaction between the star and disk , we follow the formulation of mp05 . here ,",
    "we summarize the parts of that work that are relevant for our spin evolution model , and the reader will find details in that paper .",
    "this torque model follows several previous works ( e.g. , cc93 ; ac96 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the primary advantage the mp05 formulation has for this work is that it includes the effects of varying magnetic coupling and magnectic connectedness between the star and disk .",
    "the basic model is one - dimensional ( in radius , @xmath37 ) and assumes the star has a rotation - axis - aligned dipolar magnetic field anchored into its surface , such that the magnetic field strength varies in the equatorial plane as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the magnetic field strength at the equator and surface of the star .",
    "the surrounding accretion disk is assumed to be thin , so that the magnetic field has a negligible radial component along the disk surface .",
    "the torque depends strongly upon the strength of the large - scale magnetic field @xmath39 .",
    "both disk locking and stellar wind spin - down models for t tauri stars require global ( dipolar ) magnetic fields with surface strengths in the range of hundreds to thousands of gauss .",
    "observations of pre - main - sequence stars typically find field strenghts with a mean absolute value of @xmath63  kg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the large - scale ( global ) fields of these stars appear to be at most several hundred gauss @xcite .",
    "while this discrepancy means that the magnetic fields are complex ( not simple dipoles ) , it is clear that these stars possess dynamically significant magnetic fields @xcite . for the models presented here , we choose two values of the magnetic field strength , @xmath39 = 500 g and 2000 g , in addition to some cases with @xmath40 , used for comparison",
    "previous models for pre - main - sequence spin evolution ( e.g. , cc93 ; ac96 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) chose a prescription for the magnetic field that depends upon the stellar spin rate and stellar radius , as motivated by the expectations of a stellar dynamo .",
    "by contrast , for the models presented here , we choose to keep the magnetic field constant in time ( a constant field was also considered in the works of @xcite and @xcite ) for three reasons .",
    "first , observations of mean fields of t tauri stars find a relatively constant field strength @xcite , regardless of stellar age , radius , or spin rate .",
    "measurements of large - scale field @xcite are more rare , and there are not yet enough clear detections to look for trends .",
    "so a fixed field is consistent with observations .",
    "second , the observed relationship between x - ray activity and spin rates of t tauri stars @xcite suggests that they are primarily in the `` saturated '' or `` supersaturated '' regime @xcite , where solar - like stellar dynamo relationships are thought to break down .",
    "it is not yet clear how the global magnetic field behaves in this fully convective phase @xcite , but at this point , adopting a constant field strength seems appropriate .",
    "finally , the main purpose of the present work is to demonstrate how the stellar spin rate is influenced by the magnetic coupling to the disk .",
    "thus , it is also convenient for illustrative purposes to keep the field a fixed constant .",
    "the stellar magnetic field lines vertically threading the disk are imperfectly coupled to it . to be clear , throughout this paper",
    ", the term `` coupling '' refers to the extent to which the magnetic field is `` frozen into '' the disk material  that is , the effective magnetic diffusion in the disk . by contrast , the magnetic `` connection '' refers to the magnetic field loops that are attached both to the star and disk .",
    "mp05 showed how the strength of the coupling affects the amount of connected flux , and how this in turn affects the integrated torques .",
    "the disk material rotates with keplerian speed , which means that there is a singular location where the angular rotation rate of the disk equals that of the star , the corotation radius , @xmath41 every location , except for @xmath42 , rotates at a different angular rate than the star .",
    "thus , the magnetic field connected to the star and threading the disk will be twisted azimuthally ( in the @xmath43-direction ) .",
    "it is assumed that the material above both the disk and star ( the `` corona '' ) is of sufficiently low density ( high alfvn speed ) that the twisting of the magnetic field at the disk surface is equilibrated along the field line on a rapid timescale .",
    "thus , the twisting of the magnetic field by the differential rotation between the star and disk imparts a torque , transferring angular momentum between the two .",
    "the variable @xmath44 quantifies the twist of the field at the surface of the disk at each radial location .",
    "this twisting occurs rapidly , on a stellar rotation timescale , so that a steady - state @xmath45 is simply determined by the balance between the differential rotation and the tendancy for the magnetic field to untwist by slipping ( or reconnecting ) azimuthally through the disk .",
    "this slipping rate depends on how well the magnetic field is coupled to the disk material .    to describe the coupling",
    ", mp05 adopted a dimensionless magnetic diffusivity parameter , which they assume to be constant throughout the disk , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the effective magnetic diffusivity , @xmath48 is the vertical thickness of the disk , and @xmath49 is the keplerian rotation velocity . in other words , @xmath50 is the inverse of the effective magnetic reynolds number of the star - disk interaction .",
    "a large value of @xmath50 corresponds to weak magnetic coupling ( rapid field slipping through the disk ) , and a small value to strong coupling ( slow slipping ) .",
    "the various models of star - disk interaction torques in the literature differ in their treatment of the magnetic field coupling , but all models adopt parameters that give similar results to mp05 with a value of @xmath50 of order unity .",
    "however , @xmath50 is a highly unknown parameter , and mp05 suggested that @xmath51 ( i.e. , large magnetic reynolds number ) may be more reasonable for accreting pre - main - sequence stars . in our models presented here , we consider @xmath52 to represent the most realistic case , but we also show cases with @xmath53 , for illustrative purposes .      there is a dynamical limit to how strongly a dipolar magnetic field can be twisted azimuthally .",
    "as shown by several authors @xcite , when the absolute value of the twist @xmath55 exceeds a value near unity , the magnetic pressure force associated with @xmath56 pushes outward and leads to an opening of the dipole field loops . for practical purposes",
    ", this simply means that the star and disk are no longer causally linked , and no torques can be transmitted between the two .",
    "this does not mean the open field lines necessarily impart zero torque .",
    "open field lines can , and likely do , transport some angular momentum from the star and/or disk ( via winds ) .",
    "however , no angular momentum is exchanged between the star and disk along open field lines . in the present work ,",
    "we consider only the torques arising in the star - disk interaction and thus neglect any torques that may arise from open field lines .    to take into account the opening of the field , the mp05 formulation includes a maximum for the absolute value of the twist , @xmath54 . in the regions of the disk where the twist is greater than this critical value",
    ", the model assumes that the magnetic field no longer connects the star to the disk .",
    "the torque on the star that would have arisen from those magnetic field lines is instead taken to be zero .",
    "mp05 showed that a value of @xmath57 represents the classical assumption of a field that remains connected at all radii in the disk .",
    "to show the effect of the opening of the magnetic field in more realistic systems , a value of @xmath58 is appropriate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mp05 showed that there exists a mode change in the magnetic connection between the star and disk , at a threshold value of the spin rate . specifically , if @xmath59 where @xmath60 then the stellar magnetic field only connects to a small region near the inner edge of the disk . in this case , which they call `` state 1 , '' no magnetic field connects the star to a radius in the disk that is larger than @xmath42 .",
    "this is significant , since in this state there exist no star - disk interaction torques that act to spin the star down ( i.e. , there are only spin - up torques ) . alternatively , when equation ( [ eq_fcrit ] ) is not valid ( for faster spin ) , the system is in `` state 2 , '' characterized by a magnetic connection to the disk over a range of radii on either side of @xmath42 . in state 2 ,",
    "the star experiences both spin - up and spin - down torques .",
    "figure 3 of mp05 illustrates these two magnetic connection states .    as evident in equation ( [ eq_fcrit ] ) , magnetic connection state 1 only occurs for relatively extreme cases of slow spin rate , weak field , and/or high accretion rate .",
    "as it turns out , all of the models with non - zero @xmath39 presented in this paper remain in state 2 for the entire time simulated .      in the region of the disk at smaller radii than @xmath42 ,",
    "the twist of the field is such that torques remove angular momentum from the disk ( giving it to the star ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is strong enough , there will be a radius above the stellar surface at which these torques can extract all of the angular momentum of the material in the disk at that radius . under these circumstances",
    ", the disk will be truncated , and accretion will proceed as a free - fall of material onto the star along the dipolar magnetic field lines .    in state 1 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq_fcrit ] ) ] , the location of the truncation radius is determined by @xmath61 in state 2 , the location of the truncation radius obeys @xmath62 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\psi f^{7/3 } } , \\ ] ] which we solve for @xmath63 using a newton - raphson method . in our models , for each timestep , we first use equation ( [ eq_fcrit ] ) to determine the magnetic connection state , then either equation ( [ eq_rt1 ] ) or ( [ eq_rt2 ] ) to find @xmath64 . finally , we check that @xmath64 is greater than @xmath9 .",
    "if not , this means the magnetic field is not strong enough to truncate the disk above the stellar surface , and we reset @xmath64 to equal @xmath9 .",
    "the truncation of the disk is due to the stellar magnetic field extracting the angular momentum of disk material at a radius of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the truncation of the disk and subsequent accretion of material adds angular momentum to the star at a rate equal to @xmath65 which is referred to as the `` accretion torque '' , which is not correct .",
    "this term actually represents a term already in the basic angular momentum equation , which is due to the change in the stellar moment of inertia ( specifically , the @xmath66 term ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq_ta ] ) of this work , which has also been derived by many previous authors ( e.g. , cc93 ; ac96 ; * ? ? ? * ) , represents the physical accretion torque . ] .",
    "note that , although equation ( [ eq_ta ] ) does not explicitly contain a dependence on the magnetic field strength , the magnetic field is central to the determination of @xmath64 ( as long as @xmath67 ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath67 , material falling onto the star transfers the bulk of its angular momentum to the magnetic field before the material reaches the stellar surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , as long as @xmath67 , the torque of equation ( [ eq_ta ] ) is experienced by the star as a magnetic torque , although we still refer to this as the `` accretion torque '' to distinguish it from the component of the torque described in section [ sec_tmag ] .",
    "in addition to the accretion torque , if the system is in state 2 , the magnetic connection over a range of radii in the disk transports angular momentum between the star and the disk . in this case",
    "@xmath68 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\ ] ] is the net torque felt by the star from both spin - up and spin - down components .",
    "we refer to this as the `` magnetic torque . ''",
    "if the system is in state 1 , the magnetic field does not connect to a significant range of radii in the disk , so we set @xmath69    as discussed in mp05 , we assume that the disk will be capable of transporting away any angular momentum that it receives from the star ( i.e. , from negative torques in eq .  [ [ eq_tmag2 ] ] ) .",
    "for example , the disk may restructure itself in response to external torques ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) in such a way as to increase the effectiveness of viscous or turbulent angular momentum transport .      the total torque on the star is the sum of the accretion and magnetic torques , @xmath70 and we neglect any other torques that may be present ( e.g. , from a stellar wind )",
    ". the total torque can be either postive or negative , depending on the balance between spin - up torques ( due to the trucation of the disk and to magnetic field lines that are azimuthally twisted in a direction that leads the rotation of the star ) and spin - down torques ( due to magnetic field lines that are twisted in a direction that lags the rotation of the star ) .",
    "for any given system , there is a particular stellar spin rate at which the net torque will equal zero ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is called the equilibrium spin rate , and the torque always acts to change the stellar spin in a direction toward this equilibrium .",
    "as indicated in equation ( [ eq_angmom ] ) , the spin also changes in response to changes in stellar radius and mass , and in general to changes in the moment of inertia .",
    "if the contribution from the torque is large compared to that from changes in the moment of inertia , the stellar spin will evolve asymptotically toward the equilibrium rate .",
    "this general idea provides the theoretical underpinning for the idea of disk locking @xcite , which holds that the stellar spin rate is determined by the current conditions in the star - disk interaction and independent of any initial conditions .",
    "mp05 described the method of computing the stellar spin rate in this hypothetical equilibrium state for their torque formulation , which uses equations ( 23)(27 ) of that work .",
    "in presenting our results below , we compare the actual spin rates to the equilibrium values to gain insight into these systems .",
    "the coupled equations ( [ eq_mdot ] ) , ( [ eq_rstar ] ) , and ( [ eq_angmom ] ) describe the evolution of the system .",
    "we wrote a computational code that solves these simultaneously , using the fourth - order runge - kutta scheme of @xcite , starting from @xmath21 yr and ending at 3 myr . for computational efficiency and numerical stability",

    "after the initial time of @xmath13 yr , the cases with higher accretion rates ( red lines ) spin somewhat more slowly than the cases with lower accretion rates .",
    "this is because the stars in the high accretion cases are gaining more mass , while conserving their angular momentum .",
    "still , this effect is relatively minor , and it is clear that the spin evolution is dominated by the change in stellar radius .",
    "specifically , the contraction from the beginning to the end of the evolution ( see figure [ fig_rstar ] ) , leads to a change in spin period by a factor of approximately 20 , and a change in @xmath79 by a factor of approximately 2 .",
    "next , we consider the case where angular momentum is added to the star from the accretion of disk material .",

    "changes with spin rate .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig_b0 ] how the accretion torque influences the spin evolution of the star .",
    "for the lowest accretion rate considered , after 3 myr , the star spins about 10% to 50% faster than in the @xmath71 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig_t0 ] ) .",
    "but for the highest accretion rate considered , the stars spin much faster .",
    "the most extreme case , with a high accretion rate and fast initial spin ( dashed red line ) , reached the @xmath36 limit enforced by our model ( see  [ sec_spin ] ) in approximately 1.5 myr .",
    "in the case with the slowest initial spin and lowest accretion rate , the spin period is 12 days during the last few myr .",
    "but the other three cases have spin periods shorter than one day during that time . in order to explain the observed spin periods of several days , for the range of accretion rates considered here",
    ", these stars must experience significant spin down torques .",
    "the next subsection presents cases that include the additional effects of torques that arise in the magnetic star - disk interaction .",
    "the results in the previous section demonstrate how the spins of accreting stars are expected to evolve in the absence of magnetic effects .",
    "in this section , we include the magnetic torques that arise from the magnetic star - disk interaction .",
    "the torque calculation follows mp05 ( described in  [ sec_sdint ] ) , and we adopt @xmath76 in order to include the effect of the opening of the field that is expected to arise due to the differential rotation between the star and disk .    figure [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] shows the results for cases with a dipole field strength of @xmath80  g at the equator of the star , and @xmath81 .",
    "this field strength is similar to the strongest yet measured dipole field on an accreting young star , 600  g for bp tau @xcite represents the equatorial value ( see  [ sub_magfield ] ) . for a dipole , @xmath39 is a factor of two lower than the polar field strength . ] .",
    "this value for @xmath50 was suggested by mp05 to best represent real systems ( see  [ sub_coupling ] ) .",
    "the four models are shown in the same format as figure [ fig_b0 ] and represent case o1 in table [ tab_parms ] .",
    "a comparison of the upper panels of figures [ fig_b0 ] and [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] reveals that the magnetic star - disk interaction has very little influence on the spin evolution , in this case . in most models , the presence of a 500 g dipole field results in spin rates that are 10 - 30% faster at an age of 3  myr than the @xmath40 case .",
    "only the model with low accretion rate and fast initial spin ( black , dashed line ) spins more slowly ( by @xmath82% ) than the non - magnetic case .",
    "panel ( d ) of figure [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] indicates that in all models , the disk is truncated very close to the corotation radius ( the lines for @xmath64 and @xmath42 are indistinguishable ) .",
    "thus , the 500 g dipole is strong enough to truncate the disk , leading to magnetospheric accretion , in spite of the fact that the stellar spin evolution is not largely affected .    the red and black dotted lines in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] represent the hypothetical equilibrium ( disk locked ) spin rate ( see  [ sub_equilib ] ) for the two different accretion rates considered .",
    "it is clear that the three models that spin faster than the non - magnetic case are all spinning more slowly than their corresponding equilibrium rate .",
    "this means that the net torque on these stars is positive ( acting to spin up the star ) .",
    "furthermore , a comparison of panels ( c ) in figures [ fig_b0 ] and [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] indicates that these three models have a larger net torque in the magnetized ( o1 ) case .",
    "this explains why these models end up spinning slightly faster than the non - magnetized case . the model with low accretion rate and fast initial spin ( black , dashed line ) evolves near the equilibrium rate , resulting in a near zero torque in panel ( c ) .",
    "however , this is simply due to a coincidence of the initial condition with the equilibrium rate , since the torque is not strong enouth to maintain equilibrium within million - year timescales .    in the disk - locking scenario ,",
    "the magnetic star - disk interaction torques are strong enough to keep the spins near their equilibrium rate .",
    "the case with @xmath80  g presented in the appendix ( c1 , figure [ fig_ginfb500bet1 ] ) , where field line opening is ignored , does approximately follow the expectations of disk locking . however , this is clearly not true for the o1 case ( figure [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] ) , since the spins of all four models at all times depend upon the choice of initial spin rate .",
    "the main result of case o1 is that , when considering the opening of the field and strong magnetic coupling , a dipole magnetic field strength of 500 g is not strong enough to significantly influence the spin evolution of one solar mass accreting pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "figure [ fig_g1b2000bet01 ] shows the results for the o2 case , which is the same as o1 , except that the magnetic field is much stronger ( @xmath83  g ) . in the o2 case , the magnetic star - disk interaction has more of an influence on the spin evolution . by comparing the top panels of figures [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] and [ fig_g1b2000bet01 ] ,",
    "it is clear that all models are spinning more slowly in the o2 case .",
    "the spin rates of the two models with the high accretion rate ( red , solid and red , dashed lines ) converge toward the equilibrium value at an age of @xmath6  myr .",
    "thus , these models approach the disk locked state , and the initial condition is `` erased '' at that time .",
    "the same is not true for the models with the low accretion rate ( black , solid and black , dashed lines ) , since the spin rate after 3  myr still depends upon the intial spin rate for those models .",
    "the o2 case is significantly different than the case with @xmath83  g presented in the appendix ( c2 , figure [ fig_ginfb2000bet1 ] ) , which ignores field line opening . by comparison ,",
    "the disk locking in the o2 , high - accretion models is marginal and only happens after @xmath6  myr , which is approaching the lifetime of disks .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that the rotation periods of all models in the o2 case are less than @xmath0  days in the age range of 13  myr .",
    "this is consistent only with the fastest rotators in the observed spin distributions ( see  [ sec_intro ] ) .",
    "thus far , we have considered @xmath81 , since this was suggested by mp05 .",
    "however , mp05 showed that the spin - down torque felt by the star is the strongest for a magnetic coupling strength of @xmath53 .",
    "this is indeed a highly diffusive situation , as this means that a magnetic field line that is tilted by 45@xmath84 will slip through the disk at a speed equal to the keplerian speed ( see mp05 ) .",
    "although this is unexpectedly diffusive for an astrophysical plasma , the correct value of @xmath50 for these systems is highly uncertain .",
    "thus , it is instructive to look at this case , which will have the most extreme effect on the stellar spins .",
    "figure [ fig_g1b2000bet1 ] shows the results of this extreme case , with @xmath53 and @xmath83  g ( case o3 ) .",
    "it is clear that , in this case , the star - disk interaction completely dominates the spin evolution of the stars .",
    "the spin rates converge toward their respective equilibrium values in 13@xmath85  yr .",
    "subsequent evolution closely follows the equilibria , consistent with the disk locking scenario .",
    "the spin periods are in the range of 310  days for ages of 13  myr .",
    "it is evident from panel ( d ) that the disk truncation radii are close to the corotation radii , but not so close that the lines overlap .",
    "this difference from the previous 2 cases is due primarily to the much higher magnetic diffusion rate in the o3 case .",
    "the star - disk interaction model of mp05 includes the effects of the field opening expected to arise from star - disk differential rotation ( @xmath76 ) , as well as the effects of magnetic coupling , parameterized by @xmath50 .",
    "based essentially upon the idea that the disk likely exists in a state of high magnetic reynolds number , mp05 argued that a value of @xmath81 is appropriate for real systems . in the present work ,",
    "we have extended the mp05 torque model into the time domain , in order to explore the consequences of magnetic star - disk coupling and connectedness on the evolution of stellar spins .    to this end",
    ", we developed a stellar spin evolution model (  [ sec_model ] ) .",
    "the model follows an accreting , one solar mass star during the hayashi phase ( from @xmath13 yr to @xmath86 myr ) and considers the torques expected to arise from the magnetic star - disk interaction .",
    "the primary goals of this work were to examine the role of disk locking and to determine if the star - disk interaction torques alone are sufficient to explain the observed range of spin rates . in developing our torque and spin - evolution model ,",
    "we have adopted many of the same assumptions as the disk - locking models in the literature , except that the mp05 torque formulation includes the effect of the opening of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , while there are inherant uncertainties associated with the adoption of many of these assumptions , our results serve best to highlight the effect of field opening _ relative _ to previous results in the literature .",
    "given the expectation that @xmath76 and @xmath81 best - represents the conditions in real systems , and for a range of accretion rates and field strengths appropriate for t tauri stars , the two main conclusions of the present work are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the models presented in figures [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] and [ fig_g1b2000bet01 ] exhibit spin periods ranging from 3 days to less than 1/3 day , in the age range of 13  myr ( see  [ sec_gam1 ] ) . these are consistent only with the fastest rotators in the observed spin period distribution , which is significantly populated from approximately 110  days ( see  [ sec_intro ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that the torque arising from the magnetic connection between the star and disk is not sufficient to explain the relatively slowly spinning , young stars .",
    "furthermore , the stars in these models are generally not in spin equilibrium ( with a net zero torque ) , and the spin rate at all times depends upon the initial spin rate ( see  [ sec_gam1 ] ) . only the models with the strongest field strength and highest accretion rate neared their equilibrium spin rate in @xmath6  myr ( see figure [ fig_g1b2000bet01 ] ) .",
    "however , this equilibrium had a relatively short spin period of less than a day .",
    "it is apparent that disk locking does not play a strong role , except possibly for the most rapid rotators .",
    "note that the term `` disk locking '' generally refers to the idea that the angular spin rate of the star is nearly equal to that of the inner edge of the disk ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) . in our magnetic models ,",
    "this condition was always true .",
    "in fact , the truncation radius was nearest to the corotation radius in the models that were furthest from spin equilibrium ( e.g. , compare panel ( d ) in figures [ fig_g1b500bet01 ] and [ fig_ginfb500bet1 ] ) .",
    "thus , these stars do have an angular spin rate that is very close to that of the disk inner edge , although it is not appropriate to think of these systems as being `` locked '' to any particular spin rate . instead",
    ", this is a consequence of how the disk is truncated . when the magnetic coupling in the disk is strong ( small @xmath50 ) , the disk will generally be truncated close to the corotation radius ( in state 2 ; see  [ sec_rt ] ) .",
    "but , the condition that @xmath87 does not necessarily mean that the star experiences a net zero torque .    in order to explain the existence of slowly rotating young stars , it is necessary to consider other possibilities .",
    "since the magnetic torques depend strongly on the magnetic field strength , it is tempting to suggest that a stronger magnetic field may solve the problem . using our model , we find that ( for @xmath81 ) a dipole field strength of @xmath88  g is required to maintain spin periods consistent with the slow rotators .",
    "however , no t tauri star has been found to have surface field strengths greater than 3  kg @xcite , and the global ( dipole ) fields are generally even weaker ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the relatively small number of stars for which there are magnetic field measurements , the present situation could be improved by more and improved observations of the global field strength and geometry .    since the models presented in section [ sec_gam1 ] with weak magnetic coupling ( figure [ fig_g1b2000bet1 ] ) exhibit slow spins , it is also appropriate to consider the possibility that real systems have weak coupling . as discussed above ,",
    "the conditions that are expected to best represent young star - disk systems from `` first principles '' suggest values of @xmath81 .",
    "however , @xmath50 is a highly uncertain parameter because the physics of magnetic coupling is not well understood , nor are the conditions that influence the coupling ( e.g. , the ionization fraction of disk gas , turbulence levels in the disk , or magnetic reconnection rates ) . in order for magnetic coupling to explain the slow rotators , the coupling strength must not be very different ( neither larger nor smaller ) than @xmath53 , since mp05 showed that the maximum spin - down torque occurs for a @xmath50 of unity .",
    "the condition that @xmath89 seems to require some fine - tuning , which makes this possiblity even more difficult to justify at present .",
    "therefore , it appears necessary to consider effects that are alternative or additional to the magnetic torques arising from the star - disk connection .",
    "real systems seem to be variable on all timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we have neglected variability here . it may be possible , for example , that short timescale ( e.g. , @xmath90  yr ) , large - magnitude variations of the accretion rate are important for the stellar mass and angular momentum evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , it is necessary to consider the angular momentum loss from pre - main - sequence stellar winds ( see  [ sec_intro ] ) .",
    "the idea that stellar winds may be important during the accretion phase is well - supported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "some recent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of rapidly rotating stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exhibit a type of `` propeller '' regime in which intermittent accretion occurs on typical timescales of several orbits of the inner disk , while most of the would - be accreting material is instead launched into a wind .",
    "for the calculations in the present work , the torque represents that which is averaged over a calculation timestep .",
    "our timesteps range from approximately 400 years ( at the earliest times ) to @xmath91 yrs . while some of the simulations in the work cited above have been run for thousands of dynamical times , this is still orders of magnitude shorter than the typical timestep in the present work .",
    "it is not clear whether the torque formulation we adopted accurately describes the time - average behavior of the accretion and closed field region in the propeller regime simulations .",
    "in addition , while these mhd simulations reliably demonstrate many of the complexities and sometimes episodic nature of the magnetic star - disk interaction , when considering the long - term evolution of the star and disk , it is not yet clear whether the duration of the episodic ( e.g. , propeller ) regime is significant for the overall spin evolution of young stars .",
    "however , the mhd simulations such as those cited above often exhibit significant outflows and torques arising from open magnetic field regions . in this respect",
    ", our result that the torques arising only from closed field regions are not sufficient to significantly spin - down the star , agrees with the simulations .",
    "it is clear that the opening of field lines is an important effect , since including this in the models indicates considerably different physics at work than the closed field models , when comparing to the same observational data . in future work",

    "this well - represents the classical @xcite model , and results in stronger spin - down torques on the star .",
    "most star - disk interaction and disk - locking models follow the ghosh & lamb model and assume a magnetic coupling strength that is equivalent ( within @xmath9220% ) to a value of @xmath53 .",

    "our assumption results in different behavior from those models , particularly at times earlier than @xmath6  myr . at these younger ages ,",

    "the models of @xcite and ac96 exhibit spin periods that are more nearly constant in time , due the different prescription of the field . still , when our results and those of @xcite and ac96 are scaled according to the torque theory to similar values of accretion rates and field strengths , the results are quantitatively consistent .",
    "the spin evolution model of cc93 is somewhat different from other works .",
    "the assumptions in that work lead to a magnetic coupling that is significantly stronger than in @xcite , ac96 , and most other models . we have determined that we get similar results to cc93 for models with @xmath77 and a coupling strength of @xmath97 .",
    "this relatively strong coupling leads to a large azimuthal twisting of the magnetic field .",

    "<S> we compute the stellar spin rates of pre - main - sequence stars as they evolve on the hayashi track to an age of 3  myr . </S>",
    "<S> how much the field opening affects the spin depends on the strength of the coupling of the magnetic field to the disk . </S>",
    "<S> for the relatively strong coupling ( i.e. , high magnetic reynolds number ) expected in real systems , all models predict spin periods of less than @xmath0 days , in the age range of 13  myr . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these systems typically do not reach an equilibrium spin rate within 3  myr , so that the spin at any given time depends upon the choice of initial spin rate . </S>",
    "<S> this corroborates earlier suggestions that , in order to explain the full range of observed rotation periods of approximately @xmath1@xmath2 days , additional processes , such as the angular momentum loss from powerful stellar winds , are necessary . </S>"
