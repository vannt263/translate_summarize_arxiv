    "aggregation underlies numerous phenomena from milk curdling and blood coagulation to planet and star formation .",
    "a review of the earlier work on aggregation has been given by chandrasekhar  @xcite ; the following work is summarized in a number of books and reviews @xcite .",
    "this research field has been initiated by a pioneering work of smoluchowski  @xcite who established the framework for the analysis of aggregation .",
    "smoluchowski considered well - mixed diluted systems and argued that the governing equation for the concentration @xmath5 of clusters of `` mass '' @xmath6 ( that is , clusters composed of @xmath6 monomers , where the monomers are the clusters of the minimal mass ) reads @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the rate at which clusters of mass @xmath9 and @xmath10 merge .",
    "only binary collisions are taken into account since the system is assumed to be diluted .",
    "mathematically , the reaction rates @xmath8 form an infinite symmetric matrix , @xmath11 ; the pre - factor @xmath12 in front of the gain terms on the right - hand side of is needed to avoid double counting .",
    "in addition to devising the mathematical framework underlying aggregation processes , smoluchowski also computed the reaction rate @xmath8 in the most important case of brownian coagulation .",
    "namely , assuming that aggregates are spherical , smoluchowski showed that @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the diffusion coefficient and the radius of the cluster of mass @xmath6 . invoking the stokes - einstein relation between the diffusivity of a spherical ( three - dimensional ) object and its radius yields @xmath16 and hence eq .",
    "gives @xmath17 .",
    "using additionally volume conservation , @xmath18 , one arrives ( up to a multiplicative factor that can be absorbed into the time variable ) at the following expression for the brownian reaction rate @xmath19    rate equations with the brownian reaction rates have never been solved .",
    "it is not shocking , of course , as mathematically they form an infinite set of coupled non - linear differential equations with varying coefficients . for simpler reaction rates , eqs .",
    "can admit analytical solutions .",
    "for instance , smoluchowski already noticed  @xcite that the brownian reaction rate is homogeneous , @xmath20 .",
    "this feature suggests to consider the simplest such reaction rate , @xmath21const .",
    "in this situation the rate equations are indeed solvable  @xcite .",
    "a very few other solvable cases have been found in later work ( see @xcite for review ) , yet for all these years there has been no progress for the brownian reaction rate .",
    "this classical case appears as analytically intractable problem as it originally looked .    in this work , we consider aggregation with input",
    ". such driven aggregating systems often approach a non - equilibrium steady state @xcite and the steady states tend to be more tractable .",
    "the details of input play rather limited role , e.g. they do not affect the emerging large mass behavior , if only clusters of small mass are injected .",
    "it is customary to assume that only monomers are injected .",
    "the governing equations then read @xmath22 where we set the strength of the monomer flux to unity .",
    "( the flux strength can always be absorbed into the time variable . )    in the long time limit , the mass distribution can become stationary .",
    "in this situation one must solve @xmath23 the stationary solutions , when they exist , often exhibit power - law behavior .",
    "these are non - equilibrium stationary states which arise due to the flux of mass from small mass scales to large mass scales supplemented by input at the small mass scale .",
    "these states are analogous to the flux - dominated stationary states that occur in fluid turbulence @xcite , passive scalar advection @xcite , wave turbulence @xcite , granular gases @xcite , and other driven aggregation systems @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the long - time behavior of the cluster size distribution for range of physically relevant models of brownian coagulation with input of monomers which are parameterized by a single scaling exponent , @xmath0 , which is related to the fractal dimension of the aggregates .",
    "we start by describing the parameter space of relevant models in sec .",
    "[ sec - models ] and outline where problems of brownian coagulation fit in this space .",
    "next in sec .",
    "[ sec - stationary ] we study the cases @xmath1 which includes smoluchowski s original problem of brownian coagulation of spherical droplets .",
    "we show that , in this regime , the size distribution becomes stationary for large times . for the case of spherical droplets , we show that the tail of the size distribution has the form @xmath24 in the @xmath25 limit , the first exact result for this classical problem to best of our knowledge . in sec .",
    "[ sec - nonstationary ] we study the cases @xmath26 where we find that the size distribution does not become stationary and characterize the dynamics for such kernels which include the physically interesting cases of stiff polymers ( @xmath27 ) and polymers in an ideal solvent ( @xmath28 ) . finally in sec .",
    "[ ideal ] , we provide some insights into the marginal case of an ideal polymer , @xmath4 although a complete analysis eludes us .",
    "we close with a short discussion .",
    "before beginning our study brownian coagulation of polymers , let us first briefly describe the wider parameter space of models in which brownian coagulation sits . this will help to place our subsequent work in context .",
    "the two - parameter class of homogeneous reaction rates given by @xmath29 has been extensively studied ( mostly without input ) in the literature .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "the reason is that members of this class , for different values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath30 , reproduce various rates ( or their asymptotics ) that appear in applications .",
    "we shall only discuss models for which the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath30 satisfy @xmath31 the reason is that a system with kernel undergoes a gelation transition when @xmath32 .",
    "gelation corresponds to a loss of mass conservation in eq .   after a finite time @xcite . in the absence of a source of monomers ,",
    "a gelling system reaches a steady state , but the steady state is trivial , namely the entire system is comprised of a single cluster which , in the limit of an infinite system , has infinite size .",
    "( in the presence of a source , a stationary state can be reached for such gelling systems @xcite but they contain only finite total mass which considerably complicates the question of how the stationary state is approached dynamically",
    ". in particular , the scaling analysis outlined in the appendix fails since the first moment of the scaling function diverges . )    in addition , following the majority of work in this field , we shall further restrict the possible values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath30 to the range @xmath33 the mathematical reason is that when @xmath34 , and/or @xmath35 , the system exhibits a highly singular phenomenon known as instantaneous gelation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this essentially means that the solution of the infinite set of rate equations is ill - defined .",
    "one can make sense of a regularized version of eq .",
    "in this regime but the cut - off plays a crucial role @xcite . in any case , for systems where coagulation requires physical contact between clusters , the reaction rate can not grow faster than the masses of the clusters .",
    "the requirements are then natural in such cases .",
    "it is instructive to recall the derivation @xcite of the stationary state for the rates , modulo the restrictions on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath30 discussed above .",
    "we shall employ the generating function approach @xcite .",
    "we denote generating functions by @xmath36 and the corresponding moments by @xmath37 to find a stationary solution to , we multiply by @xmath38 and sum over @xmath6 to obtain @xmath39 let us assume that the cluster size distribution decays algebraically for small cluster sizes .",
    "various exact solutions for particular kernels and the scaling argument outlined in appendix [ sec - scaling ] suggest that algebraic decay is plausible : @xmath40    to determine the decay exponent @xmath41 and the amplitude @xmath42 let us recast the conjectural asymptotic behavior of the mass distribution into a singular behavior of the generating function .",
    "indeed , the algebraic large @xmath6 behavior of @xmath43 is equivalent to the following singular behavior of the generating functions @xmath44 in the @xmath45 limit :    @xmath46    substituting expansions  into equation and matching the constant terms we obtain @xmath47 . matching then the leading @xmath48 behaviors we recover known results @xcite for the decay exponent @xmath49 an expression for the amplitude is rather cumbersome , but using standard identities for the euler s gamma function it simplifies to @xmath50\\cos[\\pi(a - b)/2]}{4\\pi}}\\ ] ]     correspond to the family of brownian coagulation kernels studied in detail in this paper.,scaledwidth=37.5% ]    using eqs .",
    " we can determine when the system can reach a steady state .",
    "first , we must assure that the series constituting @xmath51 and @xmath52 are convergent .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which in conjunction with lead to @xmath55 plane where and are satisfied , and thus a steady state is reached , is the semi - infinite strip denoted in fig .",
    "[ ab_fig ] by region a.    it is possible that the steady state is never reached .",
    "the analysis above shows that this can happen only outside the semi - infinite strip denoted by region c in fig .",
    "[ ab_fig ] .",
    "for instance , a sub - monolayer epitaxial growth is described by the generalized sum - kernel reaction rates @xmath56 these rates are included in the class of rates if one sets @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "two physically interesting cases are @xmath59 ( this occurs when ad - atoms undergo `` terrace '' hopping ) or @xmath60 ( for the `` periphery '' hopping mechanism ) @xcite .",
    "in both of these cases , and generally when @xmath61 , the system evolves _",
    "ad infinitum _ @xcite , e.g. the cluster density grows as @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in the borderline case of @xmath59 , there appears an additional nested logarithm @xcite , viz .",

    "these behaviors are difficult to confirm by solving numerically mean - field rate equations , let alone to observe in simulations of a sub - monolayer epitaxial growth @xcite .",
    "let us now restrict our attention to the main topic of this paper , the rates for brownian coagulation .",
    "the generalization of the smoluchowski formula , , from three to @xmath65 dimensions is @xmath66 . in the physically interesting two- and three - dimensional settings ,",
    "the range of relevant models is rather limited .",
    "if aggregation occurs on a two - dimensional substrate , in smoluchowski formula should be replaced by @xmath67 in 2d ; here we ignore this slowly varying logarithmic factor . ]",
    "then @xmath68 .",
    "now the diffusion coefficient often varies algebraically with the size of the cluster , @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the _ mobility _ exponent , and this leads to the kernel ; the corresponding behaviors have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in three dimensions for spherical aggregates we arrive at . for fractal aggregates",
    "one would get a generalized brownian kernel @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the inverse fractal dimension of clusters .",
    "most of the rest of this paper is devoted to the study of the solutions of eq .   with these rates as the parameter @xmath0 is varied .",
    "the only difference between eq .   and",
    "eq .   with @xmath73 is an additional constant factor in which actually _ affects _ the steady state .",
    "the analysis , however , is similar as we shall see in the next section . if we ignore this additional factor of 2 for the moment , the amplitude @xmath74 given by remains positive as long as @xmath75 . since @xmath76 is the fractal dimension of clusters ,",
    "we conclude that the brownian coagulation with input in three dimensions results in a stationary mass distribution if @xmath77 .",
    "the amplitude vanishes when @xmath78 thereby questioning that the mass distribution reaches a stationary limit in this case .",
    "physically @xmath78 is realized when clusters are membranes .",
    "a range of interesting behaviors arises when clusters are polymers .",
