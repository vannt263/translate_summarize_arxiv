    "in this talk , we report several works that combine coupled channel unitarity and hidden - gauge lagrangians for the interaction of vector meson among themselves .",
    "these lagrangians were introduced by bando - kugo - yamawaki @xcite and combined with unitary techniques related with the bethe - salpeter equation , provide a useful tool to generate resonances or bound states if the interaction is strong enough .",
    "these techniques were firstly applied to study the @xmath12 interaction and the interaction was strong enough to bind the @xmath12 system @xcite .",
    "thus , two bound states appeared as poles in the second riemann sheet that could be identified with the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 .",
    "the decay of these resonances to two or four pions was provided by a box or crossed box diagram from two @xmath0 mesons going to pions .",
    "these box diagrams provided a width comparable with the data quoted at the pdg @xcite , leading to satisfactory results on the mass , width and quantum numbers , as well as couplings , and thus , these dynamically generated resonances can be seen as hadronic molecules . later works that we quote in the next section",
    "have extended the model to study the vector - vector interaction in su(3 ) and the @xmath0(@xmath1)@xmath2 system .    in this manuscript",
    "we want to summarize briefly the formalism of the vector - vector interaction .",
    "then , we want to show the simple case of the @xmath0(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 interaction .",
    "within the theorical framework , there are two main ingredients : first , we take the lagrangians for the interaction of vector mesons among themselves , that come from the hidden gauge formalism of bando - kugo - yamawaki @xcite .",
    "second , we introduce the potential @xmath16 obtained from these lagrangians ( projected in s - wave , spin and isospin ) in the bethe salpeter equation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the loop function . therefore , we are summing all the diagrams containing zero , one , two ... loops implicit in the bethe salpeter equation .",
    "finally , we look for poles of the unitary @xmath19 matrix in the second riemann sheet .",
    "all this procedure is well explained in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "two main vertices are taken into account for the computation of the potential @xmath16 : the four - vector - contact term and the three - vector vertex , which are provided respectively from the lagrangians : @xmath20 @xmath21 by means of eq .",
    "( [ l3v ] ) , the vector exchange diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:3v4v ] are calculated .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:3v4v]d ) leads to a repulsive p - wave interaction for equal masses of the vectors @xcite and only to a minor component of s - wave in the case of different masses @xcite .",
    "thus , the four - vector - contact term in fig . [ fig:3v4v]a ) and the t(u)-channel vector exchange diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:3v4v]c ) are responsible for the generation of resonances or bound states if the interaction is strong enough .",
    "lagrangian : a ) four vector contact term , eq .",
    "( [ lcont ] ) ; b ) three - vector interaction , eq .",
    "( [ l3v ] ) ; c ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels from vector exchange ; d ) @xmath24 channel for vector exchange.,width=302 ]    in order to consider the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar decay mode , and thus compare properly with the available experimental data for the width , a box diagram is also included , which we show in fig . [",
    "fig : box ] for the particular case of the @xmath12 system . crossed box diagrams and box diagrams involving anomalous couplings were also calculated in @xcite , but they were much smaller , specially in the case of the anomalous coupling , than the contributions coming from the box diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] and they were not considered in later works @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in the region close to the two vector meson threshold , the three momenta of the external particles can be neglected compared with the mass of the vector meson , and thus , we can make @xmath25 for external particles , which considerably simplify the calculation . in table [ tab : geng ] , the eleven states found with this procedure in the work of @xcite , where the formalism is applied in su(3 ) , are shown .",
    "as one can see in this table , five of them can be identified with data in the pdg : the @xmath14 , @xmath26 , @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this work ,",
    "the integral of two - meson - vector loop function is calculated by means of the dimensional regularization method .",
    "this requires the introduction of one parameter , which is the subtraction constant , that is tuned to reproduce the mass of the tensor states , whereas the other states are predicted . in order to calculate the box diagrams ,",
    "one has to introduce two parameters , the cut - off , @xmath29 , for the integral , and one parameter , @xmath30 , involved in the form factor used .",
    "these parameters were considered to be around @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 gev respectively in @xcite to get reasonable values of the @xmath14 and @xmath13 widths . in the later work of @xcite",
    ", these values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 also provide a good description of the widths for the other states , as shown in table [ tab : geng ] .",
    "as one can see , the model in su(3 ) provides a good description of the properties of many physical states . in the next sections ,",
    "we generalize the model to su(4 ) , where interesting new states will appear .",
    "interaction.,width=302 ]    .properties of the 11 dynamically generated states : pole positions , masses and widths in the real axes for two different @xmath30 ( parameter related to the form factor used in the calculation of the box diagram @xcite ) compared with the experiment .",
    "all the quantities are in units of mev . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have studied the @xmath33 interaction combining coupled channel unitarity and the hidden gauge lagrangians for the interaction of vector mesons .",
    "we find a strong interaction that provides one bound state for each spin @xmath34 and @xmath6 .",
    "we can assign the states with @xmath5 and @xmath6 to the @xmath8 and @xmath35 respectively , whereas the state obtained for @xmath9 is a prediction of the model : @xmath36. in this scheme , the @xmath35 and the @xmath37 decay to @xmath38 by means of a box diagram .",
    "however , this decay is not possible for @xmath5 , providing a natural explanation on why , whereas this state is heavier than the @xmath35 , its width found in the pdg is very small compared to that , @xmath39 mev , and the decay to @xmath38 has not been observed either .",
    "the results obtained here should stimulate the search for more @xmath40 states in the region of @xmath41 .",
