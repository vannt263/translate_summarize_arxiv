    "systems confined have received considerable attention in quantum mechanics . the hydrogen atom confined in a spherical enclosure was first analyzed in 1937 @xcite , the restricted rotator in 1940 @xcite and the harmonic oscillator in 1943 @xcite . since",
    "then the one - dimensional oscillator immersed in an infinite square potential has received some attention aul-@xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that two different cases for a sort of one - dimensional half - oscillator have also been reported , one of them bound by an infinite wall @xcite , @xcite and the other one by a finite step potential @xcite .",
    "recently , the d - dimensional confined harmonic oscillator appeared in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the square well potential is an unconfined potential with vertical walls that has been used to model band structure in solids @xcite and semiconductor heterostructures @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the use of a quantum well with sloping sides might be of interest to refine those models . as a matter of fact , a sort of localized triangular potential has been an item of recent practical @xcite-@xcite and theoretical @xcite - castro investigations .    in this paper",
    "we consider the bound - state problem for a particle immersed in an one - dimensional harmonic potential which vanishes outside a finite region . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this sort of trapping has never been solved . by using confluent hypergeometric functions the process of solving the schrdinger equation for the eigenenergies",
    "is transmuted into the simpler and more efficient process of solving a transcendental equation . such as for the well - known square potential",
    ", a graphical method provides some qualitative conclusions about the spectrum of this short - range potential well .",
    "approximate analytical results for the special cases of low - lying states and high - lying states are obtained with the help of asymptotic representations and limiting forms for the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "it is shown that the localized harmonic potential yields the full harmonic potential and the square well potential as limiting cases .",
    "although the quantization condition has no closed form expressions in terms of simpler functions , the exact computation of the allowed eigenenergies can be done easily with a root - finding procedure of a symbolic algebra program . proceeding in this way , the whole bound - state spectrum is found .",
    "nevertheless , our purpose is to investigate the basic nature of the phenomena without entering into the details involving specific applications . in other words ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore a simple system which can be of help to see more clearly what is going on into the details of a more specialized and complex circumstance such as that one in ref .",

    "since the confluent hypergeometric function goes to @xmath76 as @xmath77 , one has that @xmath78 for even parity solutions and @xmath79 for odd ones as @xmath80 . then , because the square - root function vanishes for @xmath81 just one eigenenergy , that one associated with an even parity eigenfunction with @xmath82 , is allowed .",
