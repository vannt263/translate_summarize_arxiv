    "structure of external fields for creation of the electric and magnetic quadrupoles built as tightly bound pairs of dipoles with orientations opposite to each other is described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our paper",
    "we are focused on the electric quadrupolar particles being in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) state .",
    "we assume that objects have both the quadrupole electric moment ( qem ) and the dipole electric moment ( dem ) .",
    "we assume that all dipoles are aligned .",
    "we also assume that all quadrupoles have same magnitude and tensor structure .",
    "hence we have system of particles moving without any particle deformations or oscillations of the particle dipole directions .",
    "consequently the evolution of the dipole and quadrupole electric moments reduces to the evolution of the particle concentration .",
    "nevertheless , the concentration evolution are affected by the dipole - dipole , the quadrupole - dipole , and the quadrupole - quadrupole interactions .",
    "these interactions are presented in the euler equation via corresponding force fields .    applying all assumptions described above we obtain the set of quantum hydrodynamic equations consisting of the continuity and euler equations .",
    "we consider the dipole - dipole , the dipole - quadrupole , the quadrupole - quadrupole interactions as long - range interactions .",
    "we could apply the self - consistent field approximation , but it can not be done for particles in the bec state ( see discussion before formula ( [ qdbec n2 expansion ] ) of this paper , see also ref .",
    "it appears that the long - range interactions of the particles in the bec state have the exchange part only , and the self - consistent field equals to zero @xcite .",
    "fortunately the exchange part arises in the form coinciding with the formal application of the self - consistent field approximations . the last one was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after all we obtain the non - integral quantum hydrodynamic equations .",
    "these equations appear together with the equations of field , which are the pair of the quasi - electrostatic maxwell equations .",
    "the densities of the dem and qem came in the maxwell equations as the sources of the potential electric field .    under the assumption of potential velocity field",
    "we derive corresponding non - integral non - linear schrodinger equation , which is the generalization of the gross - pitaevskii equation for particles possessing the dem and the qem .",
    "the non - integral form of the gross - pitaevskii equation for electrically dipolar becs was obtained in ref .",
    "there were also presented corresponding quantum hydrodynamic equations . the electric field created by the dipoles",
    "was explicitly considered there . the electric field evolution in dipolar becs",

    "the non - integral equation for the collective particle evolution under influence of a long - range interaction appears together with equations of field .",
    "the maxwell equations are equations of field for the electromagnetic field .",
    "hence we present a description of dipolar becs , which is in agreement with the maxwell electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this brief paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present equation of quantum hydrodynamics and generalized non - integral gross - pitaevskii equation for becs with the dem and the qem . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the bogoliubov spectrum for the small amplitude collective excitations . in sec .",
    "iv a summary of obtained results is presented .",
    "the method of many - particle quantum hydrodynamics @xcite allows to derive the gross - pitaevskii equation for becs of neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation appears in the first order by the interaction radius .",
    "a generalization of this model appears at more detail consideration of the short - range interaction up to the third order by the interaction radius ref .",
    "@xcite . corresponding generalization of the bogoloubov spectrum can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method of many - particle quantum hydrodynamics proves to be useful at consideration of the three - particle interaction in becs and ultra - cold bose atoms at non - zero temperatures @xcite .",
    "different long - range interactions have been also considered in terms of the many - particle quantum hydrodynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , including the electric dipole @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and magnetic dipole ( the spin - spin ) @xcite interactions .",
    "we consider now becs with the dem and the qem .",
    "we obtain that motion of the medium obeys the following quantum hydrodynamic equations @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the particle concentration , @xmath4 is the velocity field , @xmath5 is the time derivative , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the gradient operator consisting of partial spatial derivatives , @xmath8 is the laplace operator , @xmath9 is the mass of particles , @xmath10 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath11 is the interaction constant for the short - range interaction , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the magnitude of dipole ( quadrupole ) electric moment , @xmath14 is the vector showing equilibrium direction of the dipoles , @xmath15 is the second rank tensor showing structure of the quadrupole moment of particles",
    ".    equation ( [ qdbec continuity equation ] ) is the continuity equation showing conservation of the particle number .",
    "equation ( [ qdbec euler integral ] ) is the euler equation , which is the momentum balance equation .",
    "the group of terms , on the left - hand side of the euler equation ( [ qdbec euler integral ] ) , proportional to the square of the planck constant @xmath16 , is the quantum bohm potential @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side of the euler equation consists of three terms presenting different interactions .",
    "the first term describes the short - range interaction in the gross - pitaevskii approximation , or , in other words , in the first order by the interaction radius @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second ( third ) term presents action of the electric field created by the dem and qem ( internal electric field ) on the dem ( qem ) density .",
    "hence the second term contains the dipole - dipole and part of dipole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "the third term contains another part of the dipole - quadrupole interaction and the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "comprehensive analysis of approximations of quantum hydrodynamic description of dipolar becs was presented in ref .",
    "it shows that the dipole - dipole , quadrupole - dipole , and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions between particles in the bec state , presented in the euler equation ( [ qdbec euler integral ] ) correspond to the exchange part of these interactions , instead of the self - consistent field part as it had been expected earlier @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the explicit form of exchange correlations for bosons in the bec state is in formal coincidence with the self - consistent field terms .",
    "hence it allows to introduce the electric field created by dipoles and quadrupoles as we demonstrate it below .    for instance",
    "the force field of dipole - dipole interaction in the general euler equation appears as @xmath17 , with the potential energy of dipole - dipole interaction @xmath18 .",
    "the self - consistent field term related to the part of the two particle concentration describing interaction of pairs of particles being in different quantum states and reveals in the simple representation of the two - particle concentration as the product of one - particle concentrations @xmath19 ( see the first term on the right - hand side of formula 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite , see formula 25 and discussions after formula 23 in ref .",
    "however all ultracold bosons are located in the single quantum state with the lowest energy .",
    "the self - consistent field equals to zero for these particles .",
    "thus we need to consider full formula for the two - particle concentration of weakly interacting bosons , which contains the exchange interaction contribution .",
    "this formula was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see formula ( 25 ) ) .",
    "we also present it here @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the arbitrary single - particle wave functions .",
    "we can also present the particle concentration in terms of single - particle wave functions @xmath24 .",
    "the second and third terms in formula ( [ qdbec n2 expansion ] ) are related to the exchange interaction .",
    "the second term describes exchange interaction of bosons located in different quantum states , and the third term presents the exchange interaction of bosons being in the same quantum state with quantum numbers @xmath11 , with summation over all quantum states .",
    "only one term in expansion of the two - particle concentration ( [ qdbec n2 expansion ] ) survives for particles in the bec state .",
    "this is the term of sum corresponding to the quantum state with lowest energy @xmath25 .",
    "consequently the two - particle concentration can be written as @xmath26@xmath27 , where we have assumed @xmath28 .",
    "behavior of the exchange correlations in ultracold fermions is rather different , analysis of the coulomb exchange interaction in quantum plasmas of degenerate electrons was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the internal electric field consists of two parts .",
    "one of them is created by electric dipoles .",
    "its explicit form is @xmath29 , with the green function of electric dipole interaction @xmath30 .",
    "structure of the polarization for the align dipoles is @xmath31 , where @xmath14 is the fixed direction of the dipoles .",
    "the second part of the internal electric field is created by the electric quadrupoles @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the green function giving the electric field created by the quadrupoles , @xmath34 is the density of quadrupoles moving without any deformation of particles or oscillation of the direction of particle symmetry axes , @xmath15 is the unit tensor showing the tensor structure of qem .",
    "sum of these fields satisfies the maxwell equations @xmath35 and @xmath36 equation ( [ qdbec div e ] ) is the poisson equation .",
    "densities of electric dipoles and electric quadrupoles come in the right - hand side of the poisson equation . to give the poisson equation the traditional form we can introduce an effective polarization @xmath37 containing contribution of electric dipole moments and electric quadrupole moments @xmath38 . then equation ( [ qdbec div e ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath39 .",
    "the self - consistent field approximation for system of particles with a long - range interaction was suggested by vlasov in 1938 @xcite .",
    "however we have not applied this approximation in equation ( [ qdbec euler integral ] ) , but we consider the exchange dipole - dipole , quadrupole - dipole , and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions appearing in the form coinciding with the self - consistent field .    since we consider the quasi - static evolution of dipoles the euler equation ( [ qdbec euler integral ] )",
    "is coupled with the poisson equation ( [ qdbec div e ] ) , instead of the full set of maxwell equations . hence obtained",
    "equations ( [ qdbec continuity equation])-([qdbec curl e ] ) correspond the vlasov - poisson approximation , which is an analog of the well - known model in the plasma physics .    the system of hydrodynamic equations ( [ qdbec continuity equation ] ) , ( [ qdbec euler integral ] )",
    "can be replaced by the generalized non - integral gross - pitaevskii equation for the macroscopic wave function @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the potential of velocity field @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ qdbec nlse polariz non int ed ] ) is coupled with the maxwell equations ( [ qdbec div e ] ) and ( [ qdbec curl e ] ) via the electric field @xmath46 .",
    "the particle concentration @xmath3 is related to the macroscopic wave function @xmath40 in the usual way @xmath47 .",
    "considering the small amplitude perturbations of the equilibrium state @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , we can obtain spectrum @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constant amplitudes of oscillations .",
    "a quadrupole at zero dipole moment is a pair of two dipoles , which have equal module and opposite directions .",
    "an object with quadrupole moment and non - zero dipole moment is similar to previous case , but dipoles of the pair have different length .",
    "let us introduce notation @xmath56 for shorter dipole of the pair ( the inner dipole ) , and notation @xmath57 for larger dipole of the pair , and a notation for difference of them @xmath58 ( the outer dipole ) .",
    "so , the outer dipole @xmath59 forms the dipole - dipole interaction , then the inner dipole forms the quadrupole moment of particles . considering electric quadrupole moment as a tight pair of antiparallel electric dipoles with magnitude",
    "@xmath56 being separated by distance @xmath60 we have @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we assume that dipoles parallel to the z axis , and the interdipole distance is parallel to the x axis .",
    "we have that the equilibrium polarization is directed parallel @xmath62 axes .",
    "tensor of equilibrium quadrupole moment @xmath15 has the following structure : @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "linearised set of qhd equations ( [ qdbec continuity equation ] ) , ( [ qdbec euler integral ] ) , after substituting of monochromatic perturbations gives the following relations between @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 : @xmath67 , and @xmath68}{m\\omega^{2}-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{4}}{4m}-gn_{0}k^{2}}.\\ ] ]    imaginary part of the numerator in formula ( [ qdbec ku= ] ) demonstrates that some kind of instability can arise from the electric dipole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "however the poisson equation ( [ qdbec div e ] ) contains contribution of `` dipole - quadrupole '' and `` quadrupole - dipole '' interactions canceling each other .",
    "hence final spectrum has no imaginary part .",
    "the equation of field ( [ qdbec curl e ] ) leads to @xmath69    all these intermediate results can be substituted in linearised poisson equation ( [ qdbec div e ] ) . before substituting of @xmath53 , @xmath65 , @xmath70 in the poisson equation",
    "its linearised form appears as @xmath71 where we have included @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "after the substituting we obtain @xmath75k^{2}\\varepsilon_{z}}{m\\omega^{2}-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{4}}{4m}-gn_{0}k^{2}},\\ ] ] where we have included that two terms proportional to the product of the electric dipole and electric quadrupole moments @xmath76 cancel each other .",
    "( color online ) parametric form of the angular dependence of the group of terms proportional to @xmath77 , containing the quadrupolar term , of the bogoliubov spectrum ( [ qdbec disp for discuss general with angles ] ) is presented on the figure .",
    "this group of terms dominates in the spectrum in the short - wavelength limit .",
    "we apply the following parameters of particles : mass @xmath78 @xmath79 g , particle concentration @xmath80 @xmath81 , and quadrupole moment @xmath82 debye .,width=302 ]    our calculation gives the following spectrum of collective excitations @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , @xmath88 appears inside @xmath89 only .",
    "this is the spectrum of longitudinal waves in dipolar - quadrupolar becs .",
    "we have four positive terms in spectrum ( [ qdbec disp for discuss general with angles ] ) .",
    "the first of these terms is the contribution of the quantum bohm potential .",
    "the second term is the short - range interaction contribution considered in the first order by the interaction radius @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the third term is the electric dipole moment contribution @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the last term is the contribution of the quadrupole electric moment in the bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "this term is one of main results of our paper .",
    "the electric dipole interaction gives a shift of the short - range interaction constant @xmath90 giving an anisotropic spectrum .",
    "the quadrupole electric moment gives an anisotropic shift of the quantum bohm potential contribution @xmath91 .",
    "studying the dipolar becs , researchers measure the rate of anisotropy @xmath92 of the spectrum as the ratio between the frequency at propagation of waves parallel to the external electric field @xmath93 , and the frequency of perturbations propagating perpendicular to the external field @xmath94 .",
    "hence we have for dipolar anisotropy @xmath95 . as we see from formula ( [ qdbec disp for discuss general with angles ] ) and",
    "figure ( [ qdbec fig 1 ] ) , the presence of the quadrupolar term in the bogoliubov spectrum ( [ qdbec disp for discuss general with angles ] ) does not change this ratio at any quadrupole moments of particles due to different form of quadrupolar anisotropy .",
    "quadrupolar part @xmath96 of the spectrum ( [ qdbec disp for discuss general with angles ] ) equals to zero at @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "maximal contribution of the quadrupolar part arises at @xmath97 and @xmath98 , if @xmath99 , or @xmath100 .",
    "these complicate conditions for maximum of @xmath96 arises due to the rather complicate anisotropy of @xmath101 .",
    "the difference of anisotropy form of the quarupole interaction from the anisotropy of the dipole interaction shows in no modifications of the bright , dark , and grey soliton solutions propagating in electric dipolar - quadrupolar becs parallel or perpendicular to the equilibrium polarisation considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quadrupole moment of particles leads to two characteristic lengths .",
    "one of them is given by ratio of quadrupolar part to the short - range interaction part @xmath102 .",
    "the another one appears from ratio of quadrupolar and dipolar parts @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 can be larger or smaller than the interdipole distance inside quadrupole @xmath60 .",
    "comparison of @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 , if the short - range interaction dominates over the dipole - dipole interaction ) with the wavelength @xmath106 allows to introduce regime where the quadrupole interaction is comparable with the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "let us make some estimations to compare the quadrupolar and dipolar parts of the spectrum for some common parameters .",
    "for quadrupole moment @xmath107 debye  and electric dipole moment @xmath108 debye , we have @xmath109 @xmath110 cm . at particle concentration",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81 the average interparticle distance @xmath111{n_{0}}=0.4 $ ] @xmath112 cm .",
    "wavelengths @xmath113 are larger than the average interparticle distance @xmath114 .",
    "we can see that at the average electric dipole moment , and rather large electric quadrupole moment , the quadrupolar term is about one percent of the dipolar term , or smaller .",
    "nevertheless we can expect to have rather larger contribution of the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction in denser mediums , where excitations with smaller wavelength can propagate .",
    "quadrupoles can be built as tightly bound pairs of dipole and anti - dipoles . in this case",
    "we do not have dipolar part of the spectrum . applying the feshbach resonance we can decrease the interaction constant , so that the quantum bohm potential and the quadrupolar parts of the spectrum will dominate . in this regime",
    "it is essential to compare these two terms .    for particles of mass @xmath115 @xmath116 g and quadrupole moment @xmath117 debye  ( acetylene molecules @xcite ) at the particle concentration @xmath118 @xmath81 quadrupolar term is about 0.001 of the quantum bohm potential .",
    "alkaline diatoms have larger mass and larger electric quadrupole moment ( @xmath119 debye  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , at concentration @xmath118 @xmath81 the quadrupolar term is about of @xmath120 of the quantum bohm potential .",
    "the figure ( 1 ) shows @xmath121 for particles of mass @xmath78 @xmath79 g and quadrupole moment @xmath82 debye  .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the becs of particles possessing the dipole and quadrupole moments simultaneously .",
    "spectrum ( [ qdbec disp for discuss general with angles ] ) shows that the quadrupolar term change the short - wavelength part of spectrum , then main contribution of the dipolar term is in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "we have developed the method of many - particle quantum hydrodynamics for becs of particles having the dem and the qem .",
    "we have obtained the non - integral continuity and euler equations and corresponding gross - pitaevskii equation containing the electric field created by the dems and the qems of the medium .",
    "this electric field obeys the maxwell equations .",
    "we have derived the bogoliubov spectrum containing contribution of the dipole - dipole , the quadrupole - dipole and the quadrupole - quadrupole interactions .",
    "we have found that the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction gives highly anisotropic positive contribution in the spectrum @xmath122 .",
    "the quadrupole - dipole interaction gives no contribution in the bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "obtained set of qhd equations and corresponding non - integral gross - pitaevskii equation open possibilities for studying of different collective phenomena in quadrupolar becs and becs of particles possessing the dem and the qem simultaneously .",
