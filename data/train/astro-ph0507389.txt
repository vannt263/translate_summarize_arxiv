    "in this paper we report the results of a detailed x - ray timing analysis of a 97 ks _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) observation of cygnus x-1 .",
    "our time domain analysis is based upon the phenomenological observation that the light curve is composed of bursts of emission , called `` shots . ''",
    "rxte s ability to collect long ( 128-s ) uninterrupted data segments greatly facilitates the shot analysis .",
    "our time domain analysis is complementary to the power spectral density ( psd ) analysis of @xcite ; we also perform an independent cross - spectral coherence analysis with a much larger data set .",
    "we note that a few powerful millisecond flares have been found in our data sample by @xcite , which are extreme examples of the shots which we analyze here .",
    "shot noise has been a perennial favorite among modelers of cygnus x-1 s temporal variability . in the simplest shot model",
    "all of the shots have the same shape and normalization and occur at random times .",
    "the psd of a realization of a simple shot model is the same as the psd of an individual shot , with a normalization depending on the normalization and rate of the shots @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the expectation value of the power spectrum of the model , @xmath2 is the power spectrum of a single shot , @xmath3 is the average shot rate , and @xmath4 is the normalization of the shots . if there is a distribution of parameters , it may be integrated over to obtain the resultant power spectrum .",
    "simple exponential shot models produce a power spectrum which is constant below a breakpoint and @xmath5 above it .",
    "a distribution of rise or fall times which is powerlaw between a pair of limits and zero outside them can reproduce the observed power spectrum in the hard state .",
    "@xcite used a model in which all shots had a rectangular profile , with a timescale chosen to approximate the autocorrelation .",
    "the difficulty of reproducing the psd with a simple shot model in which all shots have an identical profile has led researchers to attempt models with distributions of shot parameters .",
    "@xcite used a model featuring two different shot profiles to reproduce the power spectrum and the phase lags . @xcite and",
    "@xcite used a model with a distribution of shot timescales to reproduce the power spectrum .",
    "lochner et al . noted that almost any shot profile could reproduce the power spectrum with a suitable distribution of timescales , and extended this model to include a dependence of the shot height on its timescale , and used the phase portrait to quantify this dependence and constrain the shot profile .",
    "@xcite applied a peak detection algorithm to detect individual shots , and formed an average shot profile .",
    "subsequently @xcite extended that investigation to include distributions of the heights and time separations of the detected events by tabulating the directly observed rates in the peak bins and the separations of the peak bins of consecutive shots .",
    "their results were argued by @xcite to support a `` sandpile '' model of self organized criticality ( soc ) in the disk , in which `` fuel '' for the shots builds up in some location in the disk and accretion is triggered when a critical local density is surpassed . in this model",
    "the shot rate is proportional to the amount of fuel present .",
    "shots use up fuel , so shots are less likely to occur after another shot , particularly a large one .    rxte observed cygnus x-1 in december 1996 with its maximum effective area , which provided the best resolution of the indivual flares ( shots ) .",
    "the observation took place over a period of 2 days during which the flux , averaged over timescales longer than that typical of shots , was within 11% of the 2 - 10 kev 4600 counts @xmath6 . taking this to be a quasi - stationary `` low , hard '' state ( based on the energy spectrum )",
    ", we examined the light curves .",
    "we present the results in section 3 , with the implications for the soc model .",
    "we also investigated the energy dependence of the variations , including the coherence ; these considerations are presented in section 4 .",
    "we discuss in section 5 how these results disagree with extended corona models .",
    "@xcite have shown that the energy dependence of the autocorrelation functions also disagrees with the extended corona models .",
    "@xcite in addition carried out higher order timing analyses on these data .",
    "the results for the skewness implied that there are relations between neighboring shots , that they were correlated in arrival time and/or luminosities , so that our result on the arrival time distribution refines this conclusion .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the root mean square variability ( rms ) for cygnus x-1 and other sources was ( on time scales within a state s duration ) proportional to the local mean flux level . @xcite",
    "have shown that this relationship would be a natural consequence of a particular model of non - linear processes and that it would not arise out of a simple model of additive flux arising from independent shots .",
    "@xcite argue that the fundamental model should be multiplicative processes , which then generate accumulations of flux which are the apparent shots . from this point of view",
    "a train of additive independent shots does not directly reflect what is happening in the source . in our study",
    "the shots are a phenomenological occurrence , whose properties we document and can compare to the implications of a variety of models .",
    "cygnus x-1 was observed by the rxte / pca in the hard state on 1996 december 1617 , and a couple of hours on december 15 and 18 ( observation i d 10236 ) .",
    "the observation spanned 182700  s of real time ( 29 orbits ) , collecting 97311  s of data .",
    "two single - bit , one binned , and one event mode were used for this observation .",
    "the modes are summarized in table  [ cx1-hard - mode - tab ] .",

    "the event mode covers the energy range from the top of the other modes to the end of the detector s range , and is able to provide good time and energy resolution due to the relatively low count rates at high energies .",
    "background due to unrejected particles and induced radioactivity was about 5% of the 2 - 13 kev rate during the times outside the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "the modeled background , which is based on measured particle rates during the observation , varied by 15% .",
    "the data were not selected on the rate of electrons entering the detectors .",
    "it was moderately elevated for less than 2% of the data and there was no excess variance or correlation of the rate of events accepted as good x - ray events .",
    "we apply a peak detection algorithm to hard state light curves to find shots , and examine individual events in detail . in order to be detected as a shot , a time bin must be the highest within a time range to either side ( the detection window , @xmath10 ) and must be higher than a threshold value .",
    "the threshold used was a multiple , @xmath11 , of a local average of the light curve : all points within a time range extending equally to either side of the point in question ( the filter window , @xmath12 ) were averaged .",
    "this is the convolution of the signal with a rectangular kernel , also known as a boxcar filter .",
    "the detection criteria for a time bin @xmath13 to be accepted as a shot may thus be expressed in closed form : @xmath14,\\ k \\in [ i+1,\\ i+m]\\ ] ] and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of counts in bin @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the number of time bins of width @xmath20 in the detection and filter windows , respectively .",
    "note that the statement that the bin is the maximum is not strictly accurate ; if multiple bins with the same rate are closer than @xmath10 , the last one and only the last one will trigger detection .",
    "this differs from the algorithm of @xcite in the definition of the local average ; they used a segmented scheme in which the local average was piecewise constant .",
    "the values of the constants in the detection algorithm used were @xmath212.0 , @xmath22  s , and @xmath23  s. 97152  s of data collected by the rxte pca were analyzed , yielding 36985 shots ( an average rate of 0.380  s@xmath24 ) , about 33000 of which were successfully analyzed .",
    "the data used were collected in a binned mode , with time resolution of @xmath25  s and covering an energy range of 213  kev .",
    "the average count rate was 4608  count  s@xmath24 and the detector dead time was less than 2% .",
    "note that at the shot peaks the deadtime is as large as 11% , so that the true shot profiles are actually peaked more sharply . in view of the larger statistical errors ( about 16% at the peaks ) , the effect of deadtime was not corrected since it does not have a significant impact on the questions being investigated . the average shot shape for the hard state is shown in figure  [ hard - avg - fig ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this method is not without limitations .",
    "it can not detect events separated by less than @xmath10 , only selecting the largest events .",
    "it selects the highest shots , rather than the most significant  a short high shot would be detected preferentially to a longer , but lower shot with higher fluence ( total counts or energy ) .",
    "if multiple shots pile up , the sum is detected as a single large shot .",
    "in fact , since the method selects the highest points , it has a preference for selecting times when multiple shots have piled up . due to statistical fluctuations in the detected rate",
    ", it may not select the actual peak of the shot .",
    "this is mitigated somewhat by the process of fitting individual shots , described below .",
    "the method has a selection effect suppressing the detection of shots separated by short intervals .",
    "if two shots are closer to each other than @xmath12 ( or a little more ) , each raises the local average at the position of the other , and both are less likely to be detected .",
    "this effect can be seen as a break in the distribution of delays between shots .",
    "when the detection routine was run repeatedly with different values of @xmath12 , the break point in the distribution varied systematically , and was fairly well approximated by @xmath26 .",
    "if the occurrence times of the individual shots are uncorrelated ( a common assumption ) , an exponential distribution of the time intervals between adjacent shots should be observed .",
    "@xcite reported that the observed distribution falls below this expected shape for short separations .",
    "we find that our observed distribution for separations longer than 1.5  s ( recall that the distribution is truncated around 1  s ) is consistent with an unbroken exponential .",
    "a break in the distribution at 5  s is expected for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ delexp - fig ] .    , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the region above 1.5 s has been fit to a broken exponential .",
    "the slope above 5.2 s was @xmath30 and the slope between 1.5 s and 5.2 s was @xmath31 .",
    "note that the shot peaks are obtained from the fit results described in section [ shotfits ] .",
    "[ delexp - fig],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to compare more directly with the @xcite result , we recompute figure  [ delexp - fig ] with fixed 8 second piecewise constant averaging segments to obtain the local average , and otherwise the same parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , shown in figure  [ td100_tf08-fig ] .",
    "the same basic features are observed as for the boxcar filter .",
    "next , we compute the case which corresponds directly to the negoro et .",
    "result from _ ginga _ data , i.e. 32 second intervals , @xmath32 , and @xmath29 , shown in figure  [ td025_tf32-fig ] . for time intervals below 1.5  seconds",
    ", we find a sharp rise in the distribution which is consistent with the results of negoro and can be explained by shot pile - up . between 1.5 and 5 seconds",
    "we also find good agreement with the results of negoro et al .",
    ", i.e. a systematic lowering of the number of shots as compared to an exponential extrapolation from above 5.25 s. negoro et al .",
    "argue that this constitutes evidence for the hypothesis of `` reservoirs '' in the disk or `` self - organized criticality '' .",
    "however , we also computed the case of 32 second intervals , @xmath10 = 1 s , and r = 2.0 , shown in figure  [ td100_tf32-fig ] . raising @xmath10 to cover the typical duration of the shots",
    "nearly eliminates the pile - up and at the same time the depression in the range 1.5 to 5 seconds . from comparison of figure  [ td100_tf08-fig ] and",
    "figure  [ td025_tf32-fig ] , we see that the slope drawn in figure  [ td025_tf32-fig ] is near the suppressed slope of figure  [ td100_tf08-fig ] ; the boundary of the supression discussed above was moved higher when @xmath12 was raised to 32 s. additional suppression is at work when @xmath10 is very short , shorter than the duration of the shots .",
    "thus the suppression appears to arise from systematic effects in identifying shots and has not provided evidence for self - organized criticality .",
    "we employ an automated levenberg - marquardt fitting routine to compare several template profiles to individual shots and report on the distributions of the resulting parameters .",
    "a segment of data equal to the detection window surrounding each event was fit to the following profiles : lorentzian , gaussian , symmetric exponential , two sided exponential , rising exponential and falling exponential .",
    "all models included a linear background , and a simple linear model was fit to each segment for comparison purposes .",
    "@xmath33 was used as the fit statistic rather than the c - statistic @xcite to facilitate comparison between models and shots .",
    "the two - sided exponentials and gaussians provided the lowest @xmath33 values .",
    "the distributions of @xmath33 for all the models are shown in figure  [ chi - fig ] , while several shots and their fits to the gaussian and two - sided exponential models are shown in figure  [ shot - fig ] .",
    "note that the shots were not separated on the basis of which template fit best  each shot candidate was fit to all template shapes , and the distributions associated with each template shape include all successfully analyzed shot candidates .    .",
    "degrees of freedom varied from 507 to 511 depending on the model .",
    "the data intervals around detected shots were fit to a linear background plus the following shot models : a lorentzian , a gaussian , symmetric exponential rise and fall , asymmetric ( two - sided ) exponential rise and fall , rising exponential with a sudden fall , falling exponential with a sudden rise , and no shot.[chi - fig],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as can be seen in figure  [ shot - fig ] , the fitting routine does not always fit to the feature that triggered detection .",
    "this is not surprising : a feature which makes a small contribution to many bins may be more significant than one which makes a larger contribution to fewer bins .",
    "it usually does seem to fit the same feature with the different models .",
    "since we were searching for a distribution of shot parameters , it is not disturbing that wider events are sometimes fit  they are the long - time tail of the shot timescale distribution .",
    "this seeming deficiency in the fitting process may thus act to ameliorate one of the problems with the detection process  the preference for detecting short , high shots over longer , lower ones with higher significance .",
    "the peak positions were allowed to vary from the initially detected bin during the fitting , but this had little effect on the observed distribution of time separations between shots .",
    "this is to be expected since the peak position could not vary outside the detection window , and the initially detected positions can not be closer together than the detection window  the observed distribution is truncated at the lower end by @xmath10 , the half - width of the detection window .",
    "the peak positions were thus constrained to vary by less than the minimum separation between them , resulting in little effect on the observed distribution of separations . while the distributions of the offset of the fit position from the initially detected position were all",
    "sharply peaked at zero , a marked asymmetry was visible in the wings for the symmetric exponential shots ( more were shifted to earlier times than later ) , and a lesser asymmetry with the opposite sense was observed in the two - sided exponentials .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ off - fig ] .    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the distribution of shot widths is shown in figure  [ fwhm - fig ]",
    ". suggestions of very short bursts of emission @xcite give interest to the number of very short shots .",
    "the number of shots with timescales less than 10  ms ranged from 72 , when all shots are assumed to be lorentzian , to 327 when assumed to be symmetric exponential . the shots with the shortest timescales may not have been characterized well by this process  if a shot only occupied a few bins , a greater reduction in @xmath33 could be obtained by fitting some feature of the background , which might itself be a shot with longer timescale and lower amplitude .",
    "for the two - sided exponentials , the distributions of ratios of fall to rise or rise to fall times ( whichever was larger ) closely follow similar powerlaws , slope near -1.5 .",
    "the distribution of shots with a longer rise time is , however , higher than that for longer fall times at all points where the difference is significant , and this is reflected in the count of shots in each category : 18185 slow - rising shots vs. 14611 slow - falling ones .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ asym - fig ] .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the distributions of fit heights for the different profiles are similar .",
    "this distribution is truncated at the lower end by the requirement to be above some multiple of the local average .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ hit - fig ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the form of the distribution of directly observed rates for the peak bin ( after subtraction of the local average ) is similar , but it is displaced upwards in peak intensity when the curves are compared at constant density levels .",
    "this is partly due to a selection effect in the detection criteria favoring bins with large positive statistical fluctuations .",
    "the separation of the curves , however , is larger than would be expected from poisson fluctuations alone , suggesting that the profiles used here were not sharp enough to model the peaks of the shots .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the differences between the results for the different profiles : the gaussian profile , with the broadest peak , is displaced furthest toward small heights , while the exponential forms , with the narrowest peaks , are furthest toward high peaks .",
    "this seems inconsistent , however , with the fact that the gaussian profiles had lower typical @xmath34 values than any other profile but the two - sided exponentials .",
    "it may be that the shots have a broad base and a narrow peak , and that the gaussians tended to fit the base while the exponentials tended to fit the peak .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the distribution of timescales for the gaussian profile has more long times than those for the exponential forms .",
    "as we have noted , @xcite have found 4 powerful millisecond flares in our data sample .",
    "their shot finding algorithm @xcite is coarser than what we have used : @xmath35s , 128  s piecewise constant averaging segment , and threshold defined as @xmath36 .",
    "they have estimated that their statistics are consistent with an exponential or log - normal distribution , as extrapolated from lower amplitude shots .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis which shows no significant features in the amplitude distribution at large shot heights ( see figure  [ hit - fig ] ) .",
    "we estimate the energy by the number of photons in the integrated shot profile ( the fluence ) , and observe significant positive correlation in the joint distribution of shot timescale and fluence , shown in figure  [ tfjd - fig ] .",

    "the `` cross spectrum '' of two signals , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , is defined by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cross spectrum at frequency @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the complex conjugate of the fourier transform of @xmath37 , and @xmath43 is the fourier transform of @xmath38 .    the cross spectrum of two measured , binned , signals can be estimated by segmenting them into intervals and averaging the estimated cross spectra from each interval calculated from the discrete fourier transforms ( dfts ) of the signals : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dft of signal @xmath37 in interval @xmath46 ( out of @xmath47 ) in frequency bin @xmath48 .",
    "the cross spectrum , like the power spectrum , may also be averaged across adjacent frequencies : @xmath49    the `` transfer function '' @xmath50 represents @xmath38 as linearly related to @xmath37 through the convolution :    @xmath51    this relation may not be directly causal ; for example , it may be that both @xmath38 and @xmath37 are independently , causally , produced from some unobserved `` innovation signal '' @xmath52 , each through its own transfer function :    @xmath53    if innovation signals are applied at more than one location in the system , the observed signals will be the sum of the two innovation signals processed by the transfer functions for their respective locations . if the transfer functions for the different locations are different , their contributions to the cross spectrum will be out of phase and the `` coherence '' will be reduced .",
    "note that in the appendix we perform a test of coherence loss when multiple signals are present ; we find that the simultaneous presence of different transfer functions would result in decoherence .",
    "coherence is a linear correlation coefficient between the values of the complex fourier transforms of the two signals as a function of frequency .",
    "it measures the consistency of the phase relation ( that is , the consistency of @xmath54 , the phase of the transfer function ) between the two signals over time .",
    "the coherence may be calculated as : @xmath55 note that the coherence can not be measured with a single estimate of the cross spectrum , since a single estimate will always be consistent with itself .",
    "the observed value of the coherence is reduced by the presence of measurement noise . @xcite",
    "have derived a correction for this effect , applicable when a good estimate of the psd of the noise in the signals is available .",
    "`` good '' here means that the uncertainty in the estimate of the psd of the noise is significantly less than the psd of the signal ( which is the difference of the psds of the data and the noise ) .",
    "since the main source of measurement noise in light curves used for high - energy astrophysics is counting statistics , of which the expected psd and distribution thereof are well understood , this correction may usefully be applied here .",

    "the notion that shot parameters such as timescale and peak rate are distributed  i.e. , that the shots are not all the same  is well supported . models for generation of the shots include inhomogeneity in the orbiting matter @xcite , magnetic flares above the disk , with energy released either through reconnection , as in solar flares , or through comptonization of soft radiation in the disk by the plasma trapped in the flare @xcite .",

    "since the phase lag of @xmath66 relative to @xmath62 reaches @xmath71 at a fraction of the nyquist frequency @xmath72  hz and the cross spectrum routine was not designed with this possibility in mind , the results are only good up to this frequency . at low frequencies ( below about 1  hz ) the cross spectrum was coherent , with a time lag slightly below that imposed on @xmath66 .",
    "the coherence dropped at higher frequencies , reaching 50% at @xmath73 .",
    "the time lag started dropping at the same frequency as the coherence , reaching a value slightly higher than that imposed on @xmath67 .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ fake - coh - fig ] .",
    "it should be noted that the time delays used here are about 1/10 of those observed in the data ( to avoid further trouble with phase wrap ) .",
    "this could lessen the loss of coherence compared to what would have been observed in the data were the observed lags due to a distribution of transfer functions : if the phase lags are small , their difference must be also , so the small lags used here will underestimate the loss of coherence .",
    "we thus conclude that the simultaneous presence of different transfer functions would result in decoherence ."
