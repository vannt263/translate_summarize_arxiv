    "one of the most challenging aspects of modern particle physics is to map out the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as a function of temperature @xmath5 and baryon chemical potential @xmath6 . due to the non - perturbative nature of the strong interactions on hadronic energy scales , a first principles approach such as lattice qcd ( lqcd )",

    "the qcd partition function is symmetric by reflection in @xmath17 and it is periodic in @xmath18 with period @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "these two properties imply the phase structure depicted qualitatively in  [ fig : rw_t_mu_plane ] ( from now on we fix @xmath20 ) .",
    "in particular , varying the imaginary chemical potential , phase transitions between different @xmath21 sectors are crossed at fixed values @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( the so called roberge - weiss transitions ) .",
    "such transitions are smooth crossovers for low @xmath5 and true first - order phase transitions for high @xmath5  @xcite .",

    "recent studies  @xcite show that , for @xmath0 and @xmath30 on coarse lattices , these points are first - order triple points for small and large masses , while they are second - order endpoints for intermediate masses",

    "this is the reason why we fixed @xmath58 in all our simulations .",
    "since the temperature on the lattice is given by @xmath59 we have @xmath60 for @xmath61 .    in order to identify the nature of the roberge - weiss end- or meeting point",
    ", we use the binder cumulant @xcite defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a general observable and @xmath64 is a set of parameters on which @xmath65 depends .",
    "critical parameter values @xmath66 are defined by the vanishing of the third moment of the fluctuations . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath67 ,",
    "i.e. when non - analytic phase transitions can exist , the binder cumulant evaluated at critical couplings then takes different values depending on the nature of the phase transition ( see  [ tab : bindervalues ] ) .",
    "in our study we choose @xmath68 ( in the following @xmath69 stands for the spatially averaged @xmath70 of eq .  ) and @xmath71 .",
    "since we work at the critical value @xmath72 , then , at any value of the temperature , @xmath73 and we expect the binder cumulant to be close to 3 ( crossover ) for low @xmath5 and close to 1 ( first order ) for high @xmath5 . even though @xmath74 is a non - analytic step function for @xmath67 , at finite volume it gets smoothed out and its slope increases with the volume . around the critical coupling @xmath75 , the binder cumulant is expected to show a well - defined finite size scaling behaviour .",
    "it is then a function of @xmath76 only and can be taylor - expanded as @xmath77 close to the thermodynamic limit , the intersection of different volumes gives @xmath75 and the critical exponent @xmath2 takes its universal value depending on the type of transition . in  [ tab : bindervalues ] the values of the critical exponents relevant for our work have been summarized  @xcite .",
    "another important quantity is the order parameter susceptibility , defined as @xmath78 also this quantity is expected to scale around @xmath75 according to @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the reduced temperature and @xmath81 a universal scaling function .",
    "this means that , once the critical exponents @xmath82 and @xmath2 are fixed to the correct values , @xmath83 measured on different lattice sizes should collapse when plotted against @xmath84 .",
    "we also performed occasional cross - checks of the susceptibility for @xmath85 leading to fully consistent results .",
    "our strategy to locate the two tricritical values of @xmath54 is completely analogous to that used in ref .  .",
    "for each simulated value of @xmath54 , we measured the binder cumulant in the critical region and extracted the values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath75 and @xmath2 fitting our data according to eq .  , considering the linear term only .",

    "three or four different spatial lattice sizes per @xmath54 have been used , always with @xmath90 ( except for @xmath91 where also @xmath92 was used ) .",
    "this gives a minimal aspect ratio of almost 3 .",
    "for every lattice size , 6 up to 30 values of @xmath43 around the critical value have been simulated . between 40k500k standard hmc  @xcite trajectories of unit length per @xmath43",
    "have been collected after at least 5k trajectories of thermalization .",
    "the observables of interest ( i.e. plaquette , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) were measured for every trajectory after the thermalization . in each run the acceptance rate was tuned to @xmath9575% . for @xmath96 ,",
    "i.e. for the smallest masses , the hasenbusch trick  @xcite in the integration of the molecular dynamics equations has been used to reduce the integrator instability , which is triggered by isolated small modes of the fermion kernel  @xcite . because of the particularly delicate fitting procedure required to extract the critical exponent @xmath2 from eq .  , we almost always produced 4 different markov chains for each value of the coupling in order to better understand if the collected statistics was enough .",
    "ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting  @xcite was used to smoothly interpolate between @xmath43-points ( see  [ app : nu ] for more information about the method used to extract @xmath2 ,  [ app : sim ] for the simulations details ) .    for scale - setting purposes ,",

    "as explained in sec .  [ sec : numericsetup ] , the binder cumulant is expected to change from 3 at low @xmath5 to 1 at high @xmath5 .",
    "it is also known that @xmath103 in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath104 is the heaviside step function . on finite volumes",
    "the discontinuity is smoothed out and the binder cumulant could naively be expected to be a monotonic function of @xmath43 .",
    "however , it turns out that @xmath65 takes values higher than 3 at @xmath105 for small and large values of @xmath54 , i.e. in the first - order regions . in  [ fig : k1650bump ] the data for @xmath89 are shown , with a `` bump '' rising to values significantly larger than 3 on the crossover side of the transition . note how the bump gets higher and narrower on larger volumes .",
    "moreover , the @xmath43-region where @xmath65 changes from 3 to 1 shrinks as @xmath106 is increased , as expected for a first - order transition .",
    "the occurrence of the bump has been reported also in other studies  @xcite .",
    "this distorts the finite size analysis compared to the naive expectations , and in particular leads to significantly higher values of the binder cumulant at the intersection than expected in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "thus , the effect needs to be understood if one aims at results in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the described behaviour can be explained by modelling the distributions at work in a situation with three phases .",
    "let us consider the distribution of the imaginary part of the polyakov loop on a finite volume for sufficiently high statistics : it is a normal distribution for @xmath107 ( crossover ) and it is the sum of two normal distributions with mean values @xmath108 for @xmath109 ( first order ) .",
    "this is clearly visible in  [ fig : distributiondata ] , where histograms of @xmath94 are depicted . around the transition",
    ", the @xmath94 distribution can be thought of as the sum of three gaussian distributions , whose weights depend on the temperature .",
    "we thus consider @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath17 and variance @xmath112 , @xmath113 is a positive real number , while @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the weights of the outer and inner distributions , respectively .",
    "of course , @xmath116 . here",
    ", for simplicity , we assumed the three distributions to have the same variance .",
    "the symmetry of the outer distributions with respect to zero and the fact that their weight is the same are , instead , implied by the symmetries of the physical system .",
    "it is clear that @xmath113 has to be a function of @xmath43 as well as @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath107 , while @xmath119 and @xmath120 , i.e. the outer gaussian distributions are well separated , for @xmath109 . with an analytic expression for the distribution",

    "it is possible to think of the two cases in eqs .   as the two limits @xmath124 and @xmath125 , on condition that the weights of the distributions modify accordingly .",
    "one way to realize this is to assume that both @xmath114 and @xmath115 are functions of @xmath113 , satisfying the following conditions : @xmath126 now , in order to properly model the weights to reproduce the bump of  [ fig : k1650bump ] , we first have to understand how a binder cumulant larger than  3 can arise . leaving the weights of the three normal distributions completely general",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath121=3+\\frac{2\\,w_o\\,d^4\\:(w_i-4\\,w_o)}{(2\\,w_o\\,d^2+\\sigma^2)^2}\\;.\\ ] ] hence , when the weight of the central distribution is more than 4 times larger than the weight of the outer distributions , the binder cumulant takes values larger than 3 .",
    "it is then sufficient to choose the functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 to respect the limits above and in a way such that @xmath129 for some values of @xmath113 .",
    "a simple choice to respect the required asymptotic behaviour is    [ eq : weights ] @xmath130          w_o(d)&=\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{\\frac{d}{\\alpha}+1}}{\\frac{1}{\\alpha d+1}+2\\bigl(1-\\frac{1}{\\frac{d}{\\alpha}+1}\\bigr ) }                 = \\frac{d\\:(1+\\alpha d)}{\\alpha+3d+2\\alpha d^2}\\ ; ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath131 is a parameter to calibrate how fast the weights @xmath128 and @xmath127 change from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1/2 , respectively .",
    "more precisely , the larger @xmath132 the quicker the inner(outer ) gaussian distribution(s ) disappears(appear ) . in  [ fig : distribution ] it is shown how the distribution @xmath133 changes increasing the parameter @xmath113 for @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "one clearly sees that for small @xmath113 there is almost only the inner gaussian . for higher @xmath113",
    ", the middle normal distribution gradually disappears .",
    "thus @xmath113 plays the role of temperature or @xmath43 , and @xmath132 that of the volume .",
    "the region where the binder cumulant is larger than 3 can be found by inserting eqs .   in eq .  .",
    "then , it follows that @xmath136 actually , using the chosen weights in eq .",

    "in  [ fig : binderbump3d ] the binder cumulant of the distribution @xmath133 is plotted as function of @xmath132 and @xmath113 , keeping the standard deviation @xmath137 fixed .",
    "this picture qualitatively describes our data , as can be seen comparing it to  [ fig : k1650bump ] .",
    "in particular , the height / width of the bump increases / shrinks as the parameter @xmath132 is increased .     with the weights of eqs .  . ]",
    "lastly , we give some remarks about the connection between @xmath113 and the temperature .",
    "as already observed , it has certainly to be that @xmath138 .",
    "this function should reproduce the fact that the binder cumulant stays on the value 3 for @xmath107 , it should let the bump occur for @xmath105 and it should make the binder take the correct value for @xmath139 . since we know that @xmath65 is 3 for @xmath140 , then the first aspect can be reproduced choosing a function of @xmath43 that is almost zero for @xmath107 .",
    "the other two properties , instead , could be obtained observing that the bump in  [ fig : binderbump3d ] occurs before @xmath141 and that for @xmath141 the dependence of @xmath142 $ ] on @xmath132 drops out , @xmath143_{d=1}=3-\\frac{6}{(2 + 3\\sigma^2)^2}\\;.\\ ] ] then one could choose the function @xmath144 such that @xmath145 and choose @xmath137 in order to have the desired value of the binder cumulant at the critical temperature .",
    "for the case of interest , i.e. when the roberge - weiss endpoint is a triple point and @xmath146 , one should choose in our simple model @xmath147 , which is clearly not allowed on finite volumes .",
    "nevertheless , the standard deviation is known to go to 0 in the thermodynamic limit , when the binder cumulant takes the universal value .",
    "we will come back to this aspect later in the section . for the moment , if we just decide to reproduce our data , we have to set @xmath65 to the measured value , that is usually higher than the theoretical one ( as observed in  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in s  [ fig : binderbump2d ] , [ fig : distribution ] , and [ fig : binderbump3d ] we fixed @xmath134 that would mean @xmath148 only slightly higher than 1.5 . instead",

    "another property that the function @xmath144 should reproduce is the fact that for larger @xmath106 the transition happens faster .",
    "we already noticed that @xmath132 reproduces this feature in our model .",
    "hence it makes sense to assume @xmath151 and to let @xmath113 depend also on @xmath132 . as function of @xmath43",
    ", @xmath152 has to change more drastically around @xmath75 for increasing values of @xmath132 .",
    "one possibility which also fulfills the requirements for @xmath153 and for @xmath139 is @xmath154 inserting this choice in the expression of @xmath142 $ ] , it is possible to plot the binder cumulant as function of @xmath43 for fixed @xmath134 and for some values of @xmath132 ( that plays the role of @xmath106 ) .",
    "this has been done in  [ fig : binderbump2d ] .",
    "the similarity to  [ fig : k1650bump ] is evident .",
    "in particular , in both figures the bump shrinks and its height grows as the volume is increased .",
    "naturally , it is also possible to take the thermodynamic limit , that means let @xmath155 . to do that it is sufficient to notice that @xmath156^n=      \\lim_{\\alpha\\to\\infty}\\ : \\alpha^m e^{n\\alpha(\\beta-\\beta_c)}=      \\left\\ {      \\begin{aligned }          0       & \\;,\\ ; \\beta<\\beta_c \\\\",

    ", small value brings it to @xmath160 , i.e. not exactly the universal value . nevertheless , it is sufficient to assume @xmath161 to completely reproduce the physical situation .",

    "the binder cumulant bump is then nothing but a finite size effect !",
    "this suggests that also the larger than expected value @xmath86 is due to these corrections .",
    "+   +    to get a first impression about the nature of the phase transition , we produced collapse plots of the susceptibilities at each value of @xmath54 according to eq .  , where the norm @xmath164 of the polyakov loop was used as observable . because of the different numerical values of the ratios @xmath165 for a first- and a second - order phase transition , the collapse plots usually help to exclude one scenario . however , especially for low @xmath106 , the collapse plots of the susceptibilities are often inconclusive and we complement them with collapse plots of the binder cumulant of the imaginary part of the polyakov loop according to eq .  .",
    "in  [ fig : collapsebinder ] , we show examples at @xmath166 and @xmath89 with first - order exponents in the left column and second - order exponents in the right column . in each case , the quality of the collapse clearly prefers one set of critical exponents .",
    "this indicates that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are in the first - order region , while @xmath167 is in the second - order region .",
    "note how the binder cumulant takes values larger than 3 for the first - order @xmath54 , as discussed in the previous section , while it does not for the intermediate ones .",
    "the collapse plot technique is useful as an orientation , but it is only self - consistent and we also wish to actually calculate the critical exponents .",
    "thus we fit the binder cumulant data to eq .  , obtaining the critical exponent @xmath2 as a fit parameter . in order to have objective fitting criteria and avoid `` fits by eye '' we developed an intricate procedure which is detailed in  [ app : nu ] .",
    "[ fig : nuvskappa ] shows the values of @xmath2 extracted from the fits , plotted as function of @xmath54 .",
    "as expected , @xmath2 changes from first- to second - order values and back again .",
    "this behaviour approaches a step function in the thermodynamic limit but remains smoothed out when the lattice volume is finite .",
    "in particular , this means that @xmath2 can in principle take any value between the universal ones in the crossing region , while far away from the tricritical masses , it is compatible with @xmath168 ( first order ) for small and large @xmath54 , and with @xmath169 ( second order ) for intermediate @xmath54 . from the fit",
    ", the value of the binder cumulant at the critical coupling in the infinite volume limit , @xmath86 , can be extracted as well . in agreement with previous studies both with staggered fermions  @xcite and with wilson fermions  @xcite ,",
    "this value is slightly higher than the universal one , due to finite volume corrections as discussed in sec .",
