    "despite the fact that a fundamental description of _ m_-theory has so far remained elusive , it is nevertheless possible to describe interesting and predictive aspects of its effective phenomenology .",
    "this is possible because , whatever _ m_-theory turns out to be , it should relate at low energy to eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "this statement is actually quite powerful , especially when eleven - dimensional spacetime has a topology involving a compact orbifold factor , owing to rigorous constraints derivable from requirements imposed by field theory gauge and gravitational anomaly cancellation .",
    "there has been quite a lot of recent interest in @xmath2-theory on @xmath3 holonomy seven - manifolds for the construction of @xmath0 supersymmetric theories in four dimensions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe , in microscopic detail , a particular @xmath0 model associated with a particularly interesting _ m_-theory orbifold .",
    "although our model involves compactification on a seven - manifold , it has the structure of a @xmath4 orbifold ( admitting a calabi - yau resolution , @xcite ) times a closed interval @xmath5 .",
    "such an  orbifold with boundary \" falls outside of the class of @xmath3-resolvable orbifolds of @xmath6 studied by joyce @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , by compactification on this orbifold we do obtain a four - dimensional , @xmath0 , chiral super yang - mills theory from eleven - dimensional supergravity via explicit cancellation of anomalies .    in our analysis",
    ", we impose strict anomaly cancelation at each point in the eleven - dimensional spacetime .",
    "this is a substantially more restrictive criterion than that implied by anomaly cancellation on smaller spaces obtained when compact dimensions shrink to zero size .",
    "the latter circumstance accesses only what we call the collective anomaly , whereas our approach involves a more  microscopic \" picture of the localized states .",
    "admittedly , in our approach we are able to compute only those chiral states needed to cancel anomalies .",
    "any additional localized states which can be added without introducing additional anomalies are invisible to our analytic probe .",
    "typically , this redundancy is of very limited scope , however . in this paper",
    "we describe a consistent microscopic description of the localized states in one particular orbifold . furthermore ,",
    "as explained in @xcite , one expects a hierachy of consistent solutions for the gauge group and representation content associated with a given orbifold compactification of _ m_-theory .",
    "typically , sets of such consistent solutions are linked by phase transitions , often mediated by fivebranes and small instanton transformations . in this paper",
    "we discuss only one particular solution ; we fully expect that this solution describes only one corner of a more robust and interesting moduli space .",
    "having said this , we remark that the particular _",
    "m_-theory orbifold analyzed in this paper had been previously mentioned in @xcite as an interesting n=1 model , where it appeared as model ( c,c ) .",
    "however , in that paper no attempt was made to describe the associated spectrum from a microscopic point of view .",
    "the fact that the gauge group described in that paper differs from ours is not particulaly troubling either , since we are describing a different corner of moduli space .",
    "it would be an interesting exercise to provide a microscopic description of the models described in @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this current paper is the only extant microscopic description of a @xmath7 @xmath0 model derived from _ m_-theory .    the reason why anomaly cancellation is important in the context of _",
    "m_-theory orbifolds is that the the lift of the action of the orbifold quotient group to the gravitino field generically serves to project that field chirally onto even - dimensional fixed - point loci . on fixed - planes of dimensionality ten or six",
    "this projection induces gravitational anomalies , owing to the chiral coupling of the gravitino to currents which are classically conserved due to classical reparameterization invariance of the fixed - planes .",
    "however , since all local anomalies must cancel , the presence of gravitino - induced fixed - plane anomalies allows one to infer additional structure , such as yang - mills supermultiplets living on the fixed - planes , or specialized electric and magnetic sources of @xmath8 flux , is the four - form field strength living in the bulk supergravity multiplet .",
    "] since these supply necessary contributions to the overall anomaly , either quantum mechanically or as  inflow \" , so as to render the theory consistent .",
    "in generic situations orbifold fixed - point loci can be complicated , involving fixed - planes of various dimensionalities which can intersect . as a result",
    "there are additional concerns owing to gauge anomalies and mixed anomalies induced by chiral projection of the gaugino fields in the yang - mills supermultiplets onto fixed - plane intersections .",
    "because of this , the cancellation of all anomalies typically involves an elaborate conspiracy of quantum contributions and inflow contributions . in a previous series of papers @xcite ,",
    "much of the technology needed for implementing anomaly matching in orbifolds with intersecting fixed - planes was developed .",
    "complementary aspects and several physical observations about these orbifolds were also addresed by other authors , @xcite and @xcite in particular .",
    "this work extended the ideas and technology implemented in simpler orbifolds involving only isolated ( i.e. non - intersecting ) fixed - planes described by hoava and witten @xcite and by dasgupta and mukhi @xcite .",
    "until now , the only orbifolds with intersecting fixed - planes which have been analyzed are those corresponding to topologies @xmath9 in which the @xmath10 factor degenerates to a global orbifold @xmath11 , for the four possible cases @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the effective theory in these previously studied cases , obtained in the limit that the radii of the compact dimensions becomes very small , are uniformly six - dimensional .    in this paper",
    "we describe a new example of an _ m_-theory orbifold which has a four - dimensional effective description , and also has four dimensional fixed - planes .",
    "this model exhibits a pretty feature in that each four - dimensional fixed - plane lies at the mutual intersection of three orthogonal six - dimensional fixed - planes , each of which is a sub - manifold of a ten - dimensional fixed - plane .",
    "what is nice about this feature is that the constraints imposed by ten- and six - dimensional gravitational anomaly cancellation impinge directly on the structure of the effective field theory in four dimensions , despite the fact that there are no gravitational anomalies specifically in four dimensions .",
    "this is possible because the four - planes in question are very special sub - manifolds of the fixed ten - planes and also of the fixed six - planes .",
    "this introduces gravitational anomalies into four dimensional physics in a novel manner .",
    "thus , despite the fact that the model which we present is not of immediate phenomenological interest , it does indroduce a powerful formalism for deriving four - dimensional physics from _ m_-theory .    in our model , eleven - dimensional spacetime has topology @xmath14 .",
    "this orbifold is of the hoava - witten variety , since it includes @xmath5 as a factor , and has quotient group @xmath15 .",
    "since the orbifold is of the hoava - witten variety , in order to cancel the ten - dimensional anomaly , the fixed ten - planes , of which there are two , each support @xmath16 yang - mills supermultiplets . in this case , however , there are additional gravitational anomalies induced on the six - planes . in order to cancel these , it is necessary to introduce hypermultiplets living on these six - planes .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary that the ten - dimensional @xmath16 gauge group is broken to a subgroup @xmath17 on the six - dimensional fixed - plane corresponding to the element @xmath18 of @xmath15 .",
    "this symmetry breakdown is codified by the action of the quotient group on the @xmath16 root lattice and is , in effect , a description of a small @xmath16 gauge instanton which is localized on the fixed - plane .    in our model , the cancellation of anomalies on the ten - dimensional fixed - planes and also on the six - dimensional fixed - planes proceeds exactly as described in @xcite for the case of the @xmath19 compactification .",
    "this is because these planes are locally identical to the analogs in that simpler construction .",
    "the novel feature of the @xmath15 model , however , derives from the fact that the six - planes intersect each other at four - planes . as a result of this",
    ", there are important consistency requirements which control the ultimate breakdown patterns of @xmath16 as one approaches first a six - plane and then moves along that six plane and lands on the four plane intersection . in this paper",
    ", we present an explicit consistency analysis which enables us to compute the complete set of twisted states and the gauge group localized on the four - dimensional fixed - planes .",
    "we do not review the hoava - witten analysis @xcite which explains the ten - dimensional anomaly cancellation nor do we review the cancellation of the six - dimensional anomalies .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for a comprehensive description of these cases .",
    "section 2 addresses the global geometric aspects of our model , describing the explicit action of @xmath15 which gives rise to our orbifold of @xmath6 . in the next section ,",
    "the analysis of the local anomaly for the @xmath20 orbifold in @xcite is extended to this case .",
    "although the story for the ten - planes is quite analogous , the six - planes require more subtle methods .",
    "for this reason we introduce `` branching tables '' and `` embedding diagrams '' for determining which projections in the @xmath16 root lattice are compatible with the orbifold quotient group action . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we use this data to determine the spectrum seen by the four - dimensional intersection which arises from the ten - dimensional @xmath16 fields , and discuss further twisted states which we need to introduce to cancel the six - dimensional anomalies . finally , following a synopsis ,",
    "we indicate why the four - dimensional gauge anomaly does not arise for our orbifold , and summarize the representation content of the chiral multiplets in our model ( `` model 1 '' ) in table 7 .",
    "further models with @xmath7 and @xmath0 susy , based on both abelian and non - abelian orbifolds , will be discussed in forthcoming work .",
    "consider a spacetime with topology @xmath21 , where the compact @xmath6 factor is described by the quotient @xmath22 with lattice @xmath23 .",
    "parameterize the compact dimensions using three complex coordinates @xmath24 and one real coordinate @xmath25 .",
    "the orbifold which defines our model is obtained from this torus by making additional identifications described by parity flips as shown in table [ modone ] .",
    "the sole condition on the lattice @xmath23 in @xmath26 is that these parity flips induce lattice automorphisms .",
    "a minus sign in that table implies a relative overall sign change of the indicated coordinate ( the column header ) by the indicated element ( the row header ) .",
    "each row in table [ modone ] describes a generator of the full quotient group , which is @xmath15 .",
    ".the action of the quotient group @xmath15 on the compact coordinates @xmath27 corresponding to the model described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "in this paper , we have shown explicitly how a four dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills theory can be determined from anomaly matching on the fixed - planes of an _",
    ". one interesting aspect of this analysis is the manner in which constraints from gravitational anomalies impinge on the four dimensional spectrum , despite the fact that there are no gravitational anomalies in purely four dimensional field theories .    in our on - going work",
    "we are developing a systematic scan of all possible orbifolds obtained as quotients @xmath28 for each possible lattice @xmath23 and for each possible choice of quotient group @xmath29 . for a given orbifold constructed in this way we select those which have supercharges preserved on the fixed - planes , and",
    "then ascertain the fixed - plane twisted spectra needed to cancel all local anomalies .",
    "the more interesting cases involve non - abelian quotients .",
    "the orbifold described in this paper is the abelian orbifold of smallest possible group order yielding @xmath0 susy in four dimensions .",
    "one purpose of this paper has been to present a context for some of the rudiments of the larger algorithm which we are implementing on larger class of orbifolds , in the hopes of finding a phenomenologically compelling effective field theory limit of _ m_-theory .",
