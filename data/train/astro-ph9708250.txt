    "all current scenarios for the formation of structure in the universe assume that cosmic structures grow from initially small seed perturbations .",

    ", the one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the initial density field @xmath10 is gaussian .",
    "a measurement of the frequency of rare events ( clusters of galaxies ) coupled with a measurement of the level of rms fluctuations can tell us directly whether or not the distribution of density fluctuations satisfy the gaussian hypothesis .    while theories based on the inflationary paradigm generally predict gaussian initial conditions , there are many alternatives which do not",
    ". global textures and other topological defects , for example , predict a strongly non - gaussian distribution for the initial perturbations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "global textures arise when a global non - abelian symmetry , such as su(2 ) , is spontaneously and completely broken .",
    "when these defects collapse , energy gradients in the higgs field perturb the metric and induce gravitational fluctuations in the matter fields .",
    "these texture knots , then , act as `` causal seeds '' of structure formation .",
    "we take the texture model as our standard non - gaussian model , since it is well studied and still viable as a theory of structure formation . in general ,",
    "texture and gaussian models give similar predictions for the _ shape _ of the power spectrum and the level of cmb fluctuations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it is often noted ( e.g. , @xcite ) that texture and gaussian cdm models are _ most _ different in their pdfs . if it could be demonstrated that the initial density field were gaussian on some suitable scale , the texture model would be directly falsified .",
    "the standard method for testing gaussianity relies on measuring the @xmath11-th order reduced moments , or cumulants @xmath12 of the present - day pdf , such as skewness or kurtosis , from redshift or peculiar velocity surveys ( cf . ,",
    "strauss & willick 1995 for a review ) .",
    "the variance is @xmath13 , the skewness is @xmath14 , and the kurtosis is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the density contrast @xmath17 . for a gaussian random field ,",
    "all the cumulants of order @xmath18 are equal to zero .",
    "the growth of gaussian initial perturbations under gravitational instability naturally produces non - gaussianity in the distribution function of the density field .",
    "in particular , the cumulants follow a scaling relation @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 are independent of scale in the mildly non - linear regime for power - law power spectra ( fry 1984ab , bernardeau 1992 ) , and can be calculated from @xmath21-th order perturbation theory ( bernardeau 1994 ) .",
    "significant departures from scale - invariance are taken as signs of non - gaussianity .",
    "unfortunately , the higher - order moments are very sensitive to finite - volume effects and non - gaussian noise in the data ( c.f . the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since many non - gaussian distribution functions have long tails , it is better to _ directly _ compare the rms and the tail of the pdf , rather than relying on the moments , which are integrals over the pdf . given a distribution function , the level of tail fluctuations maps directly to a level of rms fluctuations ; the tail - inferred rms , then , must be consistent with the directly measured rms .",
    "furthermore , one should look for measures which are , as closely as possible , indicators of the initial , linear density field .    in this paper",
    ", we use the observed temperature distribution of clusters of galaxies as a measure of the tail of the distribution of initial density fluctuations , and galaxy peculiar velocities and redshift - space distortions as measures of the rms . clusters of galaxies are the most massive virialized objects in the universe , with densities a hundred or more times that of the mean density of the universe , containing only a few percent of all galaxies .",
    "they are thus extreme excursions from the mean , and hence are measures of the high potential tail of the distribution of fluctuations .",
    "we compare this with the rms level of peculiar velocity fluctuations .",
    "the rms is not as sensitive to non - linear growth as are higher order statistics ( dekel , private communication ) .",
    "both cluster and peculiar velocity observations are at roughly the same spatial scale , @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , they both measure gravitational potential fluctuations , and therefore have a similar dependence on @xmath5 , which can be approximated by defining @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rms mass fluctuation on _ tophat _ filter scale @xmath25 the remaining @xmath5 dependence is @xmath26% for the peculiar velocity and redshift distortion measurements , and @xmath27% in the range @xmath28 for the cluster measurements .",
    "this is the quantity we will attempt to determine throughout our analysis , comparing estimates of it found by various methods .    in  2",
    ", we examine various recent derivations of @xmath29 from the mark iii peculiar velocity catalog ( willick et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 , 1997a ) , and from _ iras _  galaxy redshift space distortions . in  3 , we infer @xmath29 from the redshift - zero x - ray cluster abundances , assuming a gaussian and texture pdf , using a modified press - schechter approach .",
    "we calculate the @xmath29 separately for @xmath30 , cosmologically flat ( @xmath31-dominated ) @xmath32 , and open @xmath32 . in  4 , we discuss the consistency of the rms and the tail - inferred measures of @xmath33 by performing a likelihood analysis of the gaussian and texture hypotheses .",

    "we summarize in  5 .",
    "it has been noted for more than a decade that the rms optical galaxy counts in @xmath34  spheres is @xmath35 ( @xcite ) . but given that galaxy formation is still not very well understood , it has become customary to relate this measured variance to the more fundamental rms fluctuations in the matter density @xmath36 by a bias parameter @xmath37 . for optical galaxies , @xmath38",

    "the bias , however , is clearly dependent on the galaxy type ( for example , as we will see below @xmath40 , @xcite ) , and may be dependent on scale .",

    ", we look at recent analyses of peculiar velocity and redshift survey data .      the peculiar velocity @xmath41 is the deviation of the proper velocity of a galaxy from the local hubble flow . assuming that this measured velocity follows from gravitational potential fluctuations , we obtain from linear perturbation theory ( @xcite ) : @xmath42 here @xmath16 is the mass density contrast @xmath43 , and the approximation is good to 5% .",
    "now consider filtering the velocity and density fields with a tophat of radius @xmath44 , yielding the filtered fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath47 , the divergence of the filtered velocity field , is proportional to the filtered mass density field @xmath46 .",
    "taking the rms values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 gives : @xmath48 the peculiar velocity field thus provides a direct measurement of mass fluctuations , appearing with the cosmological density parameter @xmath5 .",
    "note that in linear theory , where individual fourier components evolve independently , it makes no difference in which order one filters and takes the divergence of the velocity field .",
    "seljak & bertschinger ( 1993 ) made an early attempt to measure @xmath49 directly using the potent method ( bertschinger et al .",

    "zaroubi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) work with the measured peculiar velocities of individual galaxies , without any smoothing , so it is unclear to which scale they are most sensitive .",

    "their `` maximum likelihood '' model has @xmath52 , and the models on their `` 65%-confidence '' level contour span the range @xmath53 .",
    "we therefore take their measurement to be @xmath54 .",

    "1990 ) to determine the quantity @xmath47 from the mark iii peculiar velocities , to compute the mass power spectrum directly , subtracting out a model for the noise power spectrum derived from mock catalogs .",
    "since potent applies a gaussian filter of filter length 12@xmath51 , equivalent to a @xmath55 tophat filter ( see appendix ) , we integrate the functional form they give for the observed power spectrum , taking into account the uncertainties in the parameterization , to derive a value of @xmath56 .",

    "the temperature function of rich clusters can be predicted from the statistics of peaks in a density field ; it depends on the rms level of fluctuations @xmath24 on the scale on which clusters form , as well as @xmath5 through the relation between comoving radius and mass .",
