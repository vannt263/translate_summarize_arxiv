    "the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) has detected 1873 @xmath2-ray point sources during its first 24 months of operation ( abdo et al .",
    "the majority of the extra - galactic sources have been identified as active galactic nuclei ( agn ; abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) , while many of the galactic sources has been identified as @xmath2-ray emitting pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "gamma - ray pulsars are typically either young and energetic , such as the crab and vela pulsars , or very short period millisecond pulsars ( msps ) . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to these two classes as the energetic and millisecond pulsars . in this second source catalog ( 2fgl )",
    ", there are more than hundred identified energetic and millisecond pulsars .",
    "about half of them with gamma - ray pulsations were discovered previously by using radio pulsation search ( e.g. ransom et al .",
    "2011 ; keith et al . 2011 ; cognard et al .",
    "2011 ; caraveo 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , although there were 35 gamma - ray pulsars identified from the energetic class using a blind fourier search of the lat data ( see pletsch et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) , only four were subsequently identified as radio pulsars by folding the radio data with the pulsar ephemerides ( camilo et al .",
    "2009 ; saz parkinson et al . 2010",
    "; pletsch et al .",
    "this indicates that there is a population of `` radio - quiet '' energetic pulsars as seen from the earth .",
    "however , all 21 gamma - ray emitting msps are `` radio - loud '' . based on current observations , we can classify the current population of @xmath2-ray emitting pulsars into `` radio - loud '' energetic pulsars , `` radio - quiet '' pulsars and `` radio - loud '' msps .",
    "however , it is unclear if there is a class of `` radio - quiet '' @xmath2-ray emitting msps .",
    "it is well known that the radio emissions of pulsars are associated with the activity of polar cap accelerator . on the other hand , the high - energy emissions from the pulsar magnetosphere",
    "have been studied with polar cap model ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , slot gap model ( muslimov & harding 2003 ) and outer gap model ( takata , wang & cheng 2010a ) .",
    "the polar cap model assumes the emission region is close to the stellar surface and above the polar cap , and therefore the model implies radio - loud @xmath2-ray pulsars are much more common than radio - quiet @xmath2-ray pulsars .",
    "the outer gap and slot gap models assume an acceleration region extending to the outer magnetosphere and indicates radio - quiet @xmath2-ray pulsars are the major population of @xmath2-ray pulsars .",
    "based on the spectral shape in the gev bands and the population of radio - quiet @xmath2-ray pulsars found with _",
    "( abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) , the outer gap or slot gap region is more favorable as the origin of the @xmath2-rays from energetic pulsars ( takata , wang & cheng 2010 ) .",
    "for msps , `` radio - quiet '' millisecond @xmath2-ray pulsars have not been identified so far .",
    "this may be due to following reasons : ( 1 ) the present sensitivity of blind frequency search prevents a detection of millisecond pulsation in _ fermi _  data ; ( 2 ) most of known radio msps are in binaries that gamma - ray searches would be insensitive to , and ( 3 ) @xmath2-ray emissions from msps always accompany radio emissions .",
    "on the other hand , venter , harding & guillemot ( 2009 ) found that the pulse profiles of six msps detected by the _",
    "fermi _  can be fitted by the geometries with outer gap or the slot models .",
    "this implies that the emission regions of the @xmath2-rays are different from the radio emission site for some of the msps and thus we expect that there are `` radio - quiet '' @xmath2-ray msps for which the radio beam is outside the line of sight .",
    "it is worth noting that `` radio - quiet '' here does not mean no intrinsic radio emission , just none beamed in our direction .    in this letter",
    ", we report a multiwavelength identification of a `` radio - quiet '' @xmath2-ray msp candidate . in a separate paper ,",
    "romani and shaw ( 2011 ) arrived at similar conclusions via optical spectroscopy .",
    "to identify suitable targets of `` radio - quiet '' @xmath2-ray msps , we first selected candidates from the _ fermi _  lat first source catalog ( 1fgl ; abdo et al .",
    "2010c ) based on four criteria : 1 ) no known association at other wavelengths ; 2 ) source variability ; 3 ) galactic latitude , and 4 ) gamma - ray spectral shape .",
    "we used the variability index in the 1fgl catalog to characterize source variability .",
    "gamma - ray pulsars have always been found to be steady sources of gamma - ray emission ( abdo et al .",
    "2010c,2011 ) .",
    "this property can therefore be used to help identify which of the unidentified sources are probably pulsars .",
    "the 1fgl catalog defines a variability index , for which a value greater than 23.21 means that there is less than a 1% probability of being a steady source .",
    "we therefore selected sources with a variability index less than 23 .",
    "msps are in general older than energetic @xmath2-ray pulsars .",
    "young objects like energetic @xmath2-ray pulsars ( @xmath3myr ) are likely located in the galactic plane , while a fraction of msps should be at higher galactic latitudes .",
    "we thus selected @xmath4 sources with high galactic latitudes ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the choice of this value is based on monte - carlo simulations for the galactic population of msps , which show that no energetic @xmath2-ray pulsar exists above @xmath6 ( takata , wang & cheng 2011 ) .    finally , we identified potential candidates from the @xmath2-ray spectra .",
    "although only a power - law spectrum is listed in the first - year catalog , it also has a curvature index to indicate how good of a power - law fit .",
    "for @xmath2-ray pulsars , their @xmath2-ray spectra is usually described by a power - law plus an exponential cutoff model ( abdo et al .",
    "according to the 1fgl catalog , the curvature index , for which a value greater than @xmath7 indicates less than 1% chance that the power - law spectrum is a good fit .",
    "hence we chose objects with a curvature index larger than 12 .    if a 1fgl source satisfied all four criteria , we short - listed as a potential candidate . from the short list ,",
    "we further searched for x - ray imaging data ( _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ ) from public archive and looked for x - ray sources within the error circles of _ fermi _  as the first step for multiwavelength investigation . in this paper , we focus on one of our targets , 1fglj2339.70531 .",
    "1fglj2339.70531  is one of the 205 bright gamma - ray sources detected with _",
    "lat during its first three months of operation ( abdo et al .",
    "it remains as an unidentified source in the second _ fermi_-lat source ( 2fgl ) catalog . in the 1fgl catalog ( abdo et al .",
    "2010c ) , 1fglj2339.70531  has a variability index of 9.2 and a curvature index of 22.7 . by comparing the 1fgl and 2fgl catalog ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) , the gamma - ray flux of 1fglj2339.70531  is constant and near @xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 @xmath10 . with better statistics , the second source catalog shows that a log parabola spectrum can provide a better spectral fit comparing to a power - law model ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) . with its high galactic latitude ( @xmath11 ) and unidentified nature in all _ fermi _  catalogs ,",
    "1fglj2339.70531  is therefore one of the best targets to search for `` radio - quiet '' @xmath2-ray msps .",
    "1fglj2339.70531  was observed with _",
    "chandra _  and _",
    "swift_/xrt for 21ks on 2009 october 13 ( pi : cheung ) , and 3.2ks on 2009",
    "november 4 , respectively .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "imaging was operated with acis - i while the xrt was in the photon counting imaging mode .",
    "we reprocessed with updated calibration files .",
    "heasoft version 6 and ciao version 4.2 were used for data reduction and analysis . within the 95% error circle of _ fermi _  ( based on the refined position in the 2fgl catalog ) , there is only one relatively bright x - ray source in both observations . the brightest x - ray source ( cxou j233938.7 - 053305 ) near the center of the error circle has an x - ray flux of @xmath12 ergs s@xmath9 @xmath10 ( 0.310 kev ) based on a spectral fitting using an absorbed power - law with a best - fit photon index of 1.1 ( based on the _ chandra _  observation ) .",
    "this indicates that the ratio between the x - ray and @xmath2-ray ( @xmath13 mev ) flux ( @xmath14 ergs s@xmath9 @xmath10 ) as measured by _ fermi _",
    "( abdo et al . 2011 ) become @xmath15 , which is consistent with typical observed values for @xmath2-ray pulsars .",
    "it is worth noting that there are 9 much fainter _",
    "chandra _",
    "sources in the error circle and their x - ray - to - gamma - ray flux ratios are less than 0.1% .",
    "although we can not totally rule out their association with the gamma - ray source , such a low flux ratio is not typical .",
    "we therefore identified cxou j233938.7 - 053305 as the potential x - ray counterpart to 1fglj2339.70531 .    within the _ chandra _  error circle ( 0.6 arcsec at 90% level ) of cxou j233938.7053305 ,",
    "there is a @xmath16 star from the usno catalog ( monet et al .",
    "the same optical source is also seen in the sdss data release 8 images as sdssj233938.74 - 053305.2 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , as well as in the galex images with nuv=22.88 ( 177283 nm ) .",
    "_ swift_/uvot observations taken simultaneously with the x - ray observations detected the source with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio ( 390 ) is much too high for a foreground star and an agn ( e.g. green et al . 2004 , laird et al . 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , the spectral energy distribution from uv to optical indicates that it is unlikely to be an agn ( e.g. richards et al .",
    "2002 ) . instead , it looks like a f- or g - type star . in a separate paper ( romani & shaw 2011 )",
    ", they show via optical spectroscopy that the stellar object is consistent with a late - type star .",
    "we also had a long - term optical monitoring program with the mitsume 50 cm telescope ( kotani et al .",
    "2010 ) located at akeno observatory in japan from 2010 september to 2010 november .",
    "mitsume equips with a tricolor camera that can perform simultaneous imaging in the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 bands .",
    "it is clear from table 1 that all three bands show noticeable variability .",
    "based on the above observations , we believe that the gamma - ray / x - ray source is likely a binary system with optical emission from the irradiation of the companion star , while the central compact object is responsible to the x - ray and gamma - ray emission .",

    "+    because 1fglj2339.70531/cxou j233938.7053305 may be a new class of interesting object , we carried out an intensive optical monitoring campaign using the 1 m telescope at the lulin observatory in taiwan and the 0.8 m tenagra telescope in arizona ( see table 1 for the observation log ) .",
    "all images are flat - field and bias corrected and we performed relative photometry by comparing with several comparison stars in the field . in all 5 nights ,",
    "the light - curves clearly show variability on a timescale of 45 hours ( see figure 1 & 2 ) .",
    "we then performed a timing analysis by using the lomb - scargle periodogram on the combined optical data and found a period of 4.6342(9 ) hours .",
    "figure 2 shows the folded light - curves of all the optical data ( upper panel ) and _ chandra _  data ( lower panel ) at a period of 4.6342 hours .",
    "the phase zero is chosen at mjd 55500 .",
    "in addition , we folded the optical colors ( @xmath66 ) obtained with mitsume and x - ray hardness ratio ( 1.58kev/0.31.5kev ) at the same period ( figure 2 ) .",
    "using multi - wavelength data , we found an x - ray / optical counterpart to 1fglj2339.70531 .",
    "the x - ray - to - gamma - ray flux ratio is consistent with a gamma - ray pulsar while the gamma - ray spectrum deviates from a power - law which is commonly seen in msps .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is very hard with a power - law photon index of 1.1 .",
    "such a hard spectrum is not typical for x - ray binary , agn , and foreground star .",
    "however , some msps show similar spectral characteristics ( e.g. , archibald et al .",
    "2010 ; tam et al . 2010 ) and such a hard spectrum could be from a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "we propose that 1fglj2339.70531  is a gamma - ray emitting msp in a binary system and the optical emission is from a late - type companion star with contribution from the heating on the stellar surface .",
    "the optical light - curve shows clear modulation at a period of 4.6342 hours ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it is beyond any doubt that the periodicity is associated with the orbital period of the system . given the large variation ( about 34 magnitudes ) in the optical light - curve , the inclination must be high .",
    "better photometric data in the near infrared and light - curve modeling will be able to constrain the inclination in the future .",
    "assuming the companion has filled its the roche lobe , the mass limit of the companion star can be estimated from the orbital period . for a 4.6-hr orbital period , the mass for a normal main - sequence star is @xmath67 ( wilson et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the large optical variability and hints of color variation ( fig .",
    "2 ) suggest that the companion is being heated by the pulsar .",
    "the irradiation of pulsar @xmath2-ray emissions onto the companion star can produce the orbital modulation of the optical emission from the binary system ( e.g. takata , cheng & taam 2010 , 2011 ) . in this model ,",
    "the optical maximum occurs at the inferior conjunction , where the pulsar is located between the companion star and the earth .",
    "furthermore , during the optical maximum , the color of the star tends to be bluer because of the heating effect .",
    "there is some indication from the mitsume data that the color of the star has become bluer during the optical maximum ( fig .",
    "the maximum luminosity of the optical emission can be estimated as @xmath68 ergs s@xmath9 ) ergs s@xmath9 , where @xmath69 is the angular size of the companion star measured from the pulsar and @xmath70 is the solid angle of the @xmath2-ray beam .",
    "the observed maximum @xmath26-band magnitude of 1fglj2339.70531  is about 18 ( see table 1 ) which is consistent with the above estimation .",
    "it has been suggested that x - ray emissions from black widow systems originate from pulsar magnetosphere and/or from intra - binary shock due to the interaction between the pulsar wind and the injected material from the low mass star ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 1992 , stappers et al . 2003 ) .",
    "if the x - rays are produced in the magnetosphere , the orbital modulation will be produced due to the physical eclipse of the pulsar by the companion star . in this case",
    ", the minima of the x - ray and optical light - curves should be at the same phase , and we indeed observed that ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the x - rays originate from the intra - binary shock region , an effect of the doppler boosting relating with the post - shock flow can produce the orbital modulation ( arons & tavani 1993 ) .",
    "it has been suggested for the pulsar and massive stellar system ( e.g. psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system , bogovalov et al .",
    "2008 ) , the post - shock flow can be accelerated into relativistic regime because of an explosion in the downstream region ( see also tam et al .",
    "the doppler boosting increases the intensity as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the intensity in the comoving frame , @xmath73 is doppler factor and @xmath74 is the spectral index in the co - moving frame .",
    "an orbital modulation by a factor of five may suggest the doppler factor @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the x - ray hardness ratio roughly correlates with the x - ray light - curve ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it may suggest that the pulsar ( which has a very hard x - ray spectrum ) is physically eclipsed by the companion and that the soft emission is an extra source of light ( e.g. a wind shock ) .",
    "there is some support for this in the assymetry of the optical light curve .",
    "much better x - ray and optical photometric data are required for serious modeling .",
    "the source has a very low absorption ( @xmath77 @xmath10 ) along the line of sight . in comparison with geminga with @xmath78 @xmath10 and a distance of 150250 pc , and sax j1808.43658 with @xmath79 @xmath10 and a distance of 1.3 kpc .",
    "the distance of 1fglj2339.70531  is therefore likely to be between 300 and 1000 pc .",
    "if the companion star is a late - type main sequence ( e.g. , a m5 dwarf ) , and has @xmath80 during optical minimum when the heating effect is at minimum , the implied distance is about 700 pc .",
    "if we assume a distance of 700 pc , then the gamma - ray power is @xmath81 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "most of msps have an efficiency about 10% which gives spin - down luminosity",
    "@xmath82 ergs s@xmath9 . according to takata , cheng & taam ( 2011 ) ,",
    "the spin period of the msp can be derived from the spin - down power . using the estimated spin - down power ,",
    "the spin period will be @xmath83 ms .",
    "we note that the distance to the source is uncertain ; for instance , romani and shaw ( 2011 ) estimated a distance of @xmath84 kpc .",
    "if we assume a distance error of a factor of 2 ( i.e. , 3501400 pc ) , the spin period will be 35 ms .",
    "the bright _ fermi _  source 1fglj2339.70531  is an intriguing object that is potentially the first `` radio - quiet '' @xmath2-ray emitting msp in a binary system .",
    "despite 1fglj2339.70531  being one of the brightest unidentified pulsar - like _ fermi _  sources located at high galactic latitude , no radio detection has been reported .",
    "based on a recent pulsation search with the green bank telescope , 1fglj2339.70531  was not detected ( ransom et al .",
    "it may indicate that 1fglj2339.70531  is `` radio - quiet '' , or the radio emission must be very weak .",
    "the system resembles black widow msp for which the msp has a very low - mass ( @xmath85 ) companion in an orbit less than a day .",
    "the optical light - curves of black widow systems usually shows large orbital variation because the irradiation produces strong heating on the companion facing the pulsar .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that the companion ( usually a white dwarf ) is being evaporated by the high - energy radiation from the pulsar . on the other hand",
    ", there is a class of black widow msps with high mass ( @xmath86 ) non - degenerate companions .",
    "one classic example is psr j1023 + 0038 that has a @xmath87 companion ( archibald et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the x - ray / gamma - ray properties of 1fglj2339.70531  are similar to that of psr j1023 + 0038 but no radio emission from the former has been detected yet .    hence , we suggest that 1fglj2339.70531  is a new class of black widow - like msp system , with no or very faint radio emission along the line - of - sight .",
    "the high - mass non - degenerate companion indicates that 1fglj2339.70531  is in the late stages of recycling .",
    "the absence of radio emission is the result of different emission regions for radio and gamma - rays .",
    "for instance , the radio emission is from the polar cap with the radio beam out of the line - of - sight . on the other hand ,",
    "the gamma - ray emission is from the outer magnetosphere which is predicted by the outer gap model .",
    "an intensive search for radio emission and pulsation from 1fglj2339.70531  in the future can confirm the above scenario . at the same time , a search for gamma - ray / x - ray pulsation from the msp will reveal the true nature of the system .",

    "<S> the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has revolutionized our knowledge of the gamma - ray pulsar population , leading to the discovery of almost 100 gamma - ray pulsars and dozens of gamma - ray millisecond pulsars ( msps ) . although the outer - gap model predicts different sites of emission for the radio and gamma - ray pulsars , until now all of the known gamma - ray msps have been visible in the radio . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the discovery of a `` radio - quiet '' gamma - ray emitting msp candidate by using _ fermi _ , _ chandra _ , _ swift _ , and optical observations . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray and gamma - ray properties of the source are consistent with known gamma - ray pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> we also found a 4.63-hr orbital period in optical and x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the source is a black widow - like msp with a @xmath0 late - type companion star . based on the profile of the optical and x - ray light - curves , </S>",
    "<S> the companion star is believed to be heated by the pulsar while the x - ray emissions originate from pulsar magnetosphere and/or from intra - binary shock . </S>",
    "<S> no radio detection of the source has been reported yet and although no gamma - ray / radio pulsation has been found , we estimated that the spin period of the msp is @xmath1 ms based on the inferred gamma - ray luminosity .    </S>",
