    "casimir interactions can be viewed as a consequence of a change in the photon spectrum under a relative displacement of the interacting objects . for two parallel ideal metallic plates the change in the photon density of states ( dos ) with the plate distance @xmath0 is well - known @xcite .",
    "it is peaked close to the characteristic frequency @xmath1 which provides the dominant contribution to the interaction .",
    "however , even for simple geometries like a plate and a sphere no exact expression for the change in the dos is available .",
    "the reason for that is the difficulty to compute the distribution of eigenfrequencies of the helmholtz wave equation in arbitrary geometries .",
    "this is inherently linked to the problem of chaotic ( quantum ) billiards @xcite . for casimir interactions",
    "the natural question arises to what extent the force characterizes the shape of the interacting objects and vice versa .",
    "there is a long debate about the existence of a repulsive casimir interaction between ideal metals which was mainly initiated by the positivity of the casimir energy of a single infinitesimal thin sphere of ideal metal @xcite .",
    "so far , no example of a repulsive force between two separated ideal metallic bodies has been found .    during the last decades a number of approximative methods",
    "have been developed to determine the casimir interaction in more complicated geometries .",
    "these include the proximity and pairwise additivity approximations @xcite , semiclassical approaches @xcite , multiple scattering expansions @xcite and , more recently , a simple to implement optical approach @xcite which is however limited to short distances . despite the usefulness of these approaches in certain limits , reliable results for the entire range of energies ( or distances )",
    "are not known in general . here",
    "i shall present a formula for the density of states in terms of the free space green s function which is evaluated at the ( ideal metallic ) surfaces only .",
    "this formula will be used to compute the dos for two deformed surfaces both perturbatively in the deformations and also exactly with the aid of a previously developed numerical method for periodic surfaces @xcite .",
    "as an application , we study the lateral force between periodic surfaces . it is found that the surface s shape can be deduced from the force at short distances whereas at large separations universality prevails .",
    "for geometries with a translational invariant direction the electromagnetic field splits into transverse electric ( te ) and magnetic ( tm ) modes .",
    "both modes are described by a scalar field which fulfills either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions on the ideal metal surfaces .",
    "hence , we consider in the following the scalar field helmholtz equation @xmath2 the relevant quantity for the casimir interaction is the _ change _ @xmath3 in the dos caused by moving the surfaces from infinity to the finite distance for which one is interested in the casimir energy . hence @xmath4 is the dos for infinitely separated surfaces . the relevant finite part of the zero - point energy is then given by the sum of @xmath5 over @xmath6 .",
    "it is more convenient to work in euclidean space by performing a wick rotation to imaginary frequencies . with @xmath7",
    "the casimir energy becomes @xmath8 in order to derive the dos we start with the 4-dimensional euclidean action @xmath9 using a path - integral formulation with delta - functions enforcing the boundary conditions on the surfaces @xmath10 @xcite , one obtains the two - point correlation function in the presence of boundaries @xcite . with the free space",
    "green s function @xmath11 , the modified correlations @xmath12 in the presence of boundaries is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the functional inverse of @xmath15 with the 3d vectors @xmath16 denoting the positions of surface @xmath10 as a function of the 2d coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "this result applies to dirichlet boundary conditions . for the neumann case",
    "@xmath18 has to be replaced by @xmath19 on the right - hand side of eq .   and @xmath20 with @xmath21 the normal derivative at the surface @xmath10 .",
    "next we make use of the property that the trace of green s function yields the dos . in the euclidean formulation",
    "this relation reads @xmath22 here the spatial integration extends over all inner and other regions of the surfaces . since eq .",
    "holds in any spatial region , we obtain the change in the dos by integrating the right - hand side of that equation with @xmath23 running over the entire 3d space .",
    "the integration is easy to perform in momentum space since @xmath24 and @xmath25 occur as arguments of the free green s function in eq .  .",
    "using for the fourier transformed propagator @xmath26 , one obtains after @xmath24-integration both for @xmath27 and @xmath28 the final trace formula @xmath29 the trace runs over the 2d coordinates @xmath17 and the surface indices @xmath30 . an advantage of this formula is its independence of surface self - energies which diverge in the limit of ideal metals but are irrelevant for the interaction .",
    "it is important to note that this formula can be applied in any spatial dimension and also to other types of boundary conditions which can be implemented via delta - functions in the path integral @xcite .",
    "in this section we will apply the trace formula of eq .",
    "to two deformed but on average parallel plates . in the first part we study ( in amplitude and curvature )",
    "small deformations of general shape ( corresponding to the large distance limit ) by perturbation theory .",
    "non - perturbative numerical results for the dos of periodically corrugated surfaces with edges at closer distances are presented in the second part .",
    "let us consider two parallel surfaces with small deformations which are parametrized by @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the deformation fields @xmath33 are small compared to the mean distance @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in the deformation induced modification of the flat surface dos @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the surface area . expanding the kernel @xmath36 with @xmath37 the kernel for flat surfaces and @xmath38 the correction due to the deformations , one finds for the change of the dos @xmath39 - `` h\\to\\infty '' \\ , , \\ ] ] where the contribution for @xmath40 has to be subtracted . expanding the logarithm to second order in the deformations @xmath41 , the change of the dos can be written as @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\int_{{\\mathbf { u}},{\\mathbf { u } } ' } \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_\\alpha k_\\|(q_0;{\\mathbf { u}}-{\\mathbf { u } } ' ) \\left [ h_\\alpha({\\mathbf { u } } ) -h_\\alpha({\\mathbf { u}}')\\right]^2\\right . \\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\left .",

    "]      the above perturbative treatment is limited to small and smooth deformations .",

    "recently , a numerical tool has been developed to evaluate the casimir force for periodic surface deformations @xcite .",
    "here we shall demonstrate that same approach can be also applied to the dos .",
