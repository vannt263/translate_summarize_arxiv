    "the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation plays an important role in many - body theories .",
    "it has been widely used in various research fields , e.g. the strongly correlated electron systems  @xcite , hadron physics  @xcite , particle physics , and the field theory  @xcite .",
    "the bs equation resums its kernel , usually called the bs kernel , to infinite order .",
    "therefore , non - perturbative effects are included in the bs equation . however , usually in actual applications of the bs equation , it is impossible to obtain an exact kernel and we have to approximate it . for example , when the bs equation is employed to study the properties of mesons in the qcd , the usually adopted approximation is called the rainbow - ladder approximation , in which bare quark ",
    "gluon vertices are used to construct the four - quark kernel  @xcite .",
    "however , the rainbow - ladder approximation is the simplest approximation , which loses lots of information .",
    "lots of efforts have been made to go beyond the rainbow - ladder approximation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , when we employ the bs equation to describe a many - body system , the central point is whether the kernel used is good enough to obtain what are observed in experiments .",
    "if it is not enough , how can we improve it ? in this work",
    ", we will discuss how to improve the approximations for the bs kernel systematically .",
    "it is found that a new resummation scheme can be used to greatly improve the approximations by employing the hierarchy structure of the bs equation .    in this work",
    "we will work under the formalism of the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action theory  @xcite , which is also known as the @xmath2-derivable approximations in the condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "in the recent years , the 2pi effective action theory has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "it has been applied to calculate the entropy of the quark ",
    "gluon plasma and other thermodynamic quantities  @xcite , describe the non - equilibrium dynamics with subsequent late - time thermalization@xcite , compute the shear viscosity in the thermal field theory  @xcite , and so on . in particular , we would like to emphasize that due to many people s contributions  @xcite , it has been clear that the 2pi effective action theory can be renormalized , which is quite non - trivial for a non - perturbative approach .",
    "therefore , in our following discussions , the renormalizability of our approximation approaches will work as a prerequisite demand .",
    "the renormalizability should not be violated at any case .",

    "we have employed renormalized quantities in eq .",
    "( [ gamma_2pi ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ gamma_int ] ) .",
    "they are related to the bare quantities ( with subscript b ) through the following relations : @xmath30    in actual calculations , we must make approximations . in another words , we have to truncate the 2pi vacuum graphs included in the @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma_int ] ) .",
    "for example , one can expand @xmath28 in order of loops of skeletons , which is also known as the @xmath2 derivable approximation ; one can also expand @xmath28 in order of @xmath31 in the @xmath32 model .",
    "whatever it is , the common feature of these approximation approaches is that approximations are made to the effective action .",
    "once the approximations are made , we can employ the approximative effective action to obtain the self - consistent equation for the two - point function .",
    "we can also obtain the bs equation for the four - point function .    in this work",
    ", we will not go the same way as those described above .",
    "we will reverse the procedure , i.e. , first , we make an approximation to the bs equation , then return to the two - point function and the effective potential . comparing our approach with the conventional one",
    ", we find that our approach has several advantages : first , our approach makes much more powerful approximations .",
    "second , we can easily observe the hierarchy structure of the bs equations from our approach .",
    "finally , one can employ the hierarchy structure of the bs equations to reorganize the infinite diagrams through resummation .",
    "same as the conventional approach , our approach produces approximations which are always renormalizable . as for a non - perturbative approximation",
    ", renormalizability is a quite non - trivial demand .    in order to simplify our calculations but without lose of the generality",
    ", we consider the symmetric case in the following discussions , i.e. , @xmath33 and 3-point vertex is also vanishing .",
    "we begin with the bs equation for the four - point vertex in the coordinate space : @xmath34 where the kernel is given by @xmath35 we know that the bs equation resums diagrams in one channel to infinite order . here",
    "we designate this channel as @xmath36 channel .",
    "it is also known that the renormalizability of the bs equation demands that in the kernel @xmath17 , the two - particle reducible diagrams only can appear in the @xmath0 or @xmath1 channels .",
    "they are prohibited in the @xmath36 channel  @xcite .",
    "as we have said , the @xmath36 channel is resummed to infinite order through the bs equation .",
    "therefore , it is natural to remind us of the question : can we resum the two other channels to infinite order as well ?",
    "in fact , inspired by the parquet resummation techniques  @xcite , we realize that this can be obtained by employing the bs equation once more , i.e. , the kernel of the bs equation in eq .  ( [ bs1 ] ) can be constructed with the solution of another bs equation .",
    "therefore , we can express the kernel as @xmath37 and we have @xmath38 one may notice that there is another bs kernel @xmath39 , but we should emphasize that @xmath17 and @xmath39 belong to different hierarchies and @xmath39 is lower than @xmath17 . however , the two different bs kernels have the same symmetries , which will be discussed more carefully in the following",
    ". as one can see , there are three terms ( separated by parentheses ) on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) .",
    "the second term corresponds to diagrams which are two - particle reducible in the @xmath0 channel while 2pi in the other two channels .",
    "the third term corresponds to those which are two - particle reducible in the @xmath1 channel while 2pi in the other two channels .",
    "the first term includes diagrams which are 2pi in all the three channels .",
    "we can see that there are no diagrams which are two - particle reducible in the @xmath36 channel , since this kind of diagrams are prohibited by the renormalizability of the theory . as for the diagrams included in the @xmath40 , which are 2pi in all the three channels , one can easily recognize that the lowest order contribution to @xmath40 is just the bare vertex @xmath41 as shown in fig .",
    "we also show the next two order diagrams @xmath42 and @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , which are four and five loops , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we use `` perms '' to indicate all other possible permutations of external legs .",
    "one can find that there is no subdivergence in @xmath42 in four dimensions , and we only need a counterterm ( here denoted as @xmath44 ) to absorb the overall divergences .",
    "different from the four - loop diagrams , the @xmath43 has subdivergences which must be absorbed .",
    "for example , the second diagram in the second line of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] is employed to absorb the subdivergences , and we also notice that these diagrams are also 2pi in all channels .",
    "after the subdivergences are canceled , we only need a counterterm @xmath45 to absorb the overall divergences once more . continuing this procedure",
    ", finally we can write the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is not only 2pi in all channels but also finite .",
    "@xmath48 is related with @xmath49 through the following equation : @xmath50 here @xmath48 is kept for the following use .",
    "it is easily checked that the kernel @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) has the same symmetry as @xmath39 : @xmath51 .",
    "it is more convenient to discuss the renormalization in momentum space . in momentum space ,",
    "we attach momenta @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 with external legs whose subscripts are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath55 , @xmath58 , respectively . then , the bs equations in eq .",
    "( [ bs2 ] ) can be written as @xmath59 here the kernel @xmath39 can be obtained by the corresponding 2pi vacuum diagrams , same as that of the conventional bs equation , which also needs to be truncated .",
    "for example , we can use 2pi vacuum diagrams up to two - loop or three - loop to obtain @xmath39 , which corresponds to truncate @xmath39 to bare vertex or one - loop four - point function , respectively .",
    "certainly , if we truncate the 2pi vacuum diagrams to higher order , we can obtain the four - point diagrams which are 2pi in all the three channels , just like the diagrams in fig .",
    "in fact , the kernel @xmath39 can also have the same structure as the @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) , which receives contributions from three different kinds of diagrams .",
    "as we have emphasized above , due to many people s efforts and contributions , we have learned that the bs equation in eq .",
    "( [ bsmomen1 ] ) can be renormalized , only when the kernel @xmath39 is 2pi in the channel in which the resummation is performed through the bs equation , which is guaranteed by the 2pi property of the vacuum graphs  @xcite . in order to make @xmath60 being finite",
    ", we need a counterterm in the kernel @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we can express @xmath39 as a sum of a finite part and a divergent constant , i.e. , @xmath61 where the subscript @xmath0 indicate the @xmath0 channel .",
    "in the same way , the bs equation in eq .",
    "( [ bs3 ] ) in momentum space is @xmath62 also , we write the kernel as @xmath63    employing @xmath64 , we express eq .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) in momentum space as @xmath65 one can see that @xmath17 is also a sum of a finite part and a divergent constant ( @xmath66 ) , which make the four - point vertex @xmath67 in the following bs equation finite : @xmath68 we should emphasize that diagrams included in the kernel @xmath17 through resummation by eq .",

    "if we introduce the following renormalization condition : @xmath75 i.e. , @xmath76 then we have @xmath77 finally , we get the kernel @xmath17 as given by @xmath78 where @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) is also truncated to bare vertex .",
    "one can easily find that the kernel @xmath17 has the asymptotic behavior : @xmath79 at large @xmath55 , which is the key point to renormalize the bs equation in eq .",
    "( [ bsmomen3 ] ) .     up to one - loop .",

    "( [ bs2 ] ) , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . from the bs equation in eq .",
    "( [ bs2 ] ) , one can rewrite @xmath60 as @xmath80 where the subscripts are not labeled explicitly .",
    "one can see that the second and third terms on the right hand side of the equation above correspond to one and two iterations . substituting the kernel @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , we get their diagram representations which are shown in fig .",

    "[ f3 ] , respectively .",

    "( [ lamb ] ) . then this new bs equation with kernel @xmath82 and",
    "the bs equations discussed above constitute a set of bs equations with three different hierarchies .",
