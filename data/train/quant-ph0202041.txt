    "it has been recognized that entanglement phenomenon touches on the conceptual problems of reality and locality in quantum physics as well as the more technological aspects of quantum communications , cryptography , and computing . in particular , the methods of quantum key distribution in communication channels secured from eavesdropping are based on the use of entangled states @xcite ( for recent review , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in turn",
    ", the realization of quantum computer @xcite is dependent on the ability to form entangled states of initially uncorrelated single - particle states @xcite .    in recent years , many successful experiments have been performed to verify the violation of bell s inequalities and greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) equality @xcite and to develop the methods of engineered entanglement for quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution .",
    "in particular , the recent advances in the field of cavity qed and techniques of atom manipulation , trapping , and cooling enable a number of experiments which investigates the entanglement in the atomic systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that a pure entangled state of two atoms can be obtained in an optical resonator through the exchange by a single photon .",
    "the main idea in ref .",
    "@xcite is that a single excitation of the system is either carried by a photon or shared between the atoms .",
    "if the photon can leak out from the resonator , the absence of photon counts in the process of continuous monitoring of the cavity decay can be associated with the presence of the pure entangled atomic state .",
    "the importance of this scheme is caused by the fact that its realization seems to be easy available with present experimental technique .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to show that the entangled states in the `` atoms plus photons '' systems of the type discussed in @xcite can be represented by the so - called @xmath2 phase states corresponding to the @xmath2 algebra of the odd `` spin '' @xmath3 ,   \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the even number of atoms and @xmath4 is the number of cavity photons .",
    "in particular , the system considered in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the phase states of `` spin '' @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2 phase states were introduced in @xcite for an arbitrary spin and then generalized in @xcite to the case of the @xmath2 subalgebra in the weyl - heisenberg algebra of photon operators ( for recent review , see @xcite ) . from the mathematical point of view , this is the system of @xmath6 qubits defined in the hilbert space @xmath7 with the componentwise action of @xmath8 . in particular , we show that these states violate the classical realism and discuss their realization .    on the other hand",
    ", we will discuss a new condition of entanglement has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "let us note in this connection that , in the usual treatment of entanglement , the entangled states of a two - component ( in general , multi - component ) system are considered as the nonseparable states with respect to the subsystems ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . for example , if the individual components of a two - component system are described by the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , the state @xmath11 is entangled if @xmath12 for at least two distinct values of the subscript @xmath13 . from the mathematical point of view , the entanglement is caused by the combination of the superposition principle in quantum mechanics with the tensor product structure of the space of state of the two- or multi - component system @xcite .    very often ,",
    "the existence of entanglement is verified in terms of violation of bell s inequalities and their generalizations @xcite .",
    "another way is based on the use of ghz theorem @xcite .",
    "a possibility to introduce more general inequalities is also discussed @xcite .    it should be noted that the use of bell s inequalities and their numerous generalizations demonstrate nothing but the nonexistence of hidden variables .",
    "moreover , it is possible to say that the unique , general , and mathematically correct definition of entanglement still does not exist ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "an interesting approach has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "considering the state shared between alice and bob as a quantum communication channel , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that the information in the case of entanglement is carried mostly by the correlations between the ends of the channel .",
    "these correlations manifest themselves by means of the local measurements on the sides of the channel @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , consider a composite system defined in the hilbert space @xmath14 let @xmath15 be the group of dynamical symmetry of a subsystem in the composite system .",
    "then the hermitian operators @xmath16 associated with representation of @xmath15 in @xmath17 define the set of local measurement on the corresponding side of the channel provided by a state @xmath18 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath19 , corresponding to the epr spin-@xmath20 system , @xmath21 and the set of local measurements can be specified by the infinitesimal generators of the @xmath22 group @xmath23 which is the complexification of the @xmath2 group .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the maximum correlation between the ends of the channel corresponds to the states such that @xmath24 this statement can be illustrated by the atoms - plus - photons systems under consideration .",
    "consider first the set of two identical two - level atoms .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the excited and ground atomic states of the @xmath27 atom , respectively .",
    "then , the entangled , maximum excited atomic states in the system `` @xmath28 atoms plus @xmath29 photon '' considered in @xcite are latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath137 denotes the states of the cavity field .",
    "the coefficients @xmath138 and @xmath139 in ( 30 ) are completely determined by the initial conditions and normalization condition .",
    "it is easily seen that the state @xmath140 is the eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( 29 ) .",
    "hence , at @xmath141 the atomic phase state @xmath142 in ( 14 ) provides the stationary , maximum entangled atomic state in the system under consideration @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it is not very clear how to prepare such a state .",
    "therefore we consider a more realistic initial state provided by excitation of either atom , while the cavity field is in the vacuum state .",
    "to realize such a state , we can assume , for example , that one of the atoms ( initially de - excited ) is trapped in the cavity , while the second atom ( initially excited ) slowly passes through the cavity like in the experiments discussed in @xcite .",
    "assume for definiteness that @xmath143 then , the coefficients of the wave function ( 30 ) take the form @xmath144 where @xmath145^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "at first site , the probabilities @xmath146 to observe the states ( 14 ) corresponding to the maximum atomic entanglement , are @xmath147 respectively . at the same time , the absence of photon counts , which is considered in @xcite as a sign of the atomic entanglement , corresponds here to the case when both probabilities @xmath148 at a certain time @xmath149 .",
    "in other words , the mutually orthogonal entangled states ( 14 ) have the same probability to be observed at @xmath150 .",
    "this means that there is no atomic entanglement at all but we definitely know which atom is in the excited state .",
    "consider one more realistic initial state when both atoms are trapped in the cavity in de - excited state , while the cavity field contains a photon : @xmath151 then , for all times we get @xmath152 and @xmath153 hence , under this initial condition , the entangled state @xmath154 can not be achieved at all , while the second entangled state @xmath155 in ( 14 ) can be achieved .",
    "it is seen that , in the case of initial state ( 32 ) , the probability to detect the photon is @xmath156 this expression takes the minimum value @xmath157 at @xmath158 , @xmath159 . at the same time",
    "@xmath160 , the probability to have the entangled atomic state @xmath161 takes the maximum value @xmath162 it is seen that the pure atomic entanglement with @xmath163 is realized at @xmath164 only in the absence of the cavity detuning when @xmath165 .",
    "the parasitic influence of the cavity detuning can be compensated through the use of kerr medium filling the cavity . in this case , the hamiltonian ( 28 ) should be supplemented by the term @xmath166 which leads to the following renormalization of the rabi frequency @xmath167 then , the proper choice of the kerr parameter @xmath168 should lead to the pure entangled atomic state @xmath155 at a certain times .",
    "consider now the case of four atoms and two photons .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , neither phase state in ( 21 ) is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( 28 ) .",
    "then , the choice of the initial state either as a state with two excited atoms or as a state with one excited atom plus cavity photon does not lead to a pure atomic entanglement .",
    "as in the case of two atoms , the pure atomic entanglement can be reached under the choice of the state with the absence of the atomic excitations in the initial state .",
    "the influence of the cavity detuning can be compensated by the presence of kerr medium as well as in the case of two atoms .",
    "let us briefly discuss the obtained results .",
    "for the system of two identical two - level atoms interacting with a single photon has been proposed in @xcite it is shown that the maximum entangled atomic states are represented by the @xmath2 phase states of spin @xmath169 .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the @xmath2 phase states of the half - integer spin @xmath35 ( 1 ) form a certain class of maximum entangled atomic states in the system of @xmath0 atoms interacting with @xmath1 photons .",
    "in particular , the violation of classical realism is shown .",
    "it should be noted in this connection that the above considered @xmath2 phase states do not represent a unique way to construct the maximum entangled states in the multi - atom systems and that some other symmetries , for example the @xmath170 can be considered as well .",
    "moreover , in some cases the @xmath2 phase states can not be used to determine the maximum entangled states at all .",
    "consider for example the case of two identical two - level atoms interacting with two photons , when the atomic subsystem can be specified by the four states @xmath171 by performing a similar analysis to that described in section ii , it is easy to construct the corresponding set of the @xmath2 phase states @xmath172 which do not manifest the maximum entanglement . at the same time , the general criterion ( 4 ) permits us to determine infinitely many maximum entangled states in this case @xcite .",
    "an example is provided by the following set of orthonormal maximum entangled states @xmath173 in fact , the eq .",
    "( 4 ) gives a general condition @xcite , while the @xmath2 phase states can manifest the maximum entanglement only under a certain condition ( special choice of the effective spin ( 1 ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath2 phase states considered in sections ii and iii represent an important example of the atomic entangled states .",
    "first of all , they can be easily realized in the atomic systems in a cavity .",
    "in fact , these states have a simple physical meaning .",
    "in addition to ( 9 ) , the @xmath2 phase states can be defined to be the eigenstates of the hermitian `` cosine '' operator @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath45 is defined by eq .",
    "this operator @xmath175 can be considered as a `` hamiltonian '' , describing the correlations between the different atoms .",
    "for example , in the case of the two atoms interacting with the single photon , the operator @xmath175 takes the form @xmath176 where @xmath177 the operator structure of ( 33 ) coincides with that of the so - called model of plane rotator , which is a particular case of the heisenberg model of ferromagnetism widely used in statistical physics @xcite and in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the @xmath2 phase states have direct connection with the quantum description of polarization of spherical photons emitted by the multipole transitions in atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "therefore , the polarization entanglement of photons can be examined in direct analogy to the above discussed atomic entanglement @xcite . at the same time , the consideration of spherical photons requires the use of more quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "consider as an example the cascade decay of a two - level atom specified by the transition @xcite @xmath178 and @xmath179 denote the angular momentum and projection of the angular momentum of the excited and ground atomic states , respectively .",
    "this transition gives rise to an entangled photon twins @xcite .",
    "each photon carries spin @xmath29 , but because of the conservation of the angular momentum in the process of radiation , the sum of projections of the angular momenta of the two photons should be equal to zero . denoting the state of a photon",
    "with given @xmath180 by @xmath181 , we get the three possible states of the photon subsystem @xmath182 these three `` individual '' states can be used to construct the dual basis of the @xmath2 phase states @xcite @xmath183 similar to ( 18 ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that these states manifest the maximum entanglement .",
    "let us stress that the general condition of the type of ( 4 ) is also valid in the case of states ( 34 ) .",
    "however , the definition of local measurement should be changed in this case . because of the number of degrees of freedom per photon is equal to three",
    ", the hermitian operators associated with the @xmath184 group should be considered instead of the infinitesimal generators of the @xmath22 group .",
    "for example , the set of the stokes operators of the ref .",
    "@xcite , corresponding to the representation of the @xmath184 subalgebra in the weyl - heisenberg algebra of spherical photons , can be used to define the complete set of local measurements in this case .",
    "it is shown in section iv that the realization of a pure atomic entanglement in the @xmath36-type atom + photon systems strongly depends on the choice of initial state .",
    "viz , the entangled states can be reached in the process of steady - state evolution only if all @xmath0 atoms are initially in the de - excited states , while the cavity contains just @xmath1 photons .",
    "this condition has an intuitively clear explanation : the excitations of different atoms have the same probability and therefore each photon in the @xmath36-system is shared with a couple of atoms .",
    "it is also shown in section iv that the presence of the cavity detuning hampers the creation of a pure entangled atomic state .",
    "this negative effect can be compensated through the use of kerr medium in the cavity .",
    "we now note that the practical realization of a long - lived , maximum entanglement in a quantum mechanical system strongly depends on the interaction between this system and environment .",
    "the point is that the state of a closed quantum mechanical system changes periodically , providing the maximum entanglement as an instant event only at a certain times ( see section iv ) .",
    "such a periodicity is caused by a finite number of degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "to destruct such a periodicity , it is necessary to connect the system to a `` heat bath '' , which would tune in the system to a required state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been proposed to support the atomic entanglement by the cavity losses . in this case , the absence of the photon counting outside the cavity can be associated with the existence of the entangled atomic state in the cavity .      in view of realization of atomic entanglement with present experimental technique",
    ", it seems to be more convenient if the existence of entangled state in a cavity would manifest itself via a signal photon rather than the absence of photon leakage from the cavity . in this case , there should be at least the two modes such that one of them ( the cavity mode ) provides the correlation between the atoms , while the second can freely leave the resonator to signalize the existence of the entanglement . such a process",
    "can be realized through the use of the raman process in atoms shown in fig . 1 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . here",
    "the dipole transitions are allowed between the levels @xmath29 and @xmath28 and @xmath28 and @xmath79 , while forbidden between @xmath29 and @xmath79 because of the parity conservation . in the simplest case",
    ", we should assume that the two identical atoms of this type are located in a cavity , which has a very high quality with respect to the pumping mode @xmath185 , while the stokes photons with frequency @xmath186 can leak away freely .",
    "assume that the atoms are initially in the ground state @xmath29 , the stokes field is in the vacuum state , and the pump field consists of a single photon .",
    "the evolution of the system can lead to the absorption of the cavity photon by either atom with further emission of the stokes photon , which leaves the cavity .",
    "after that , the atoms are in entangled state , corresponding to the excitation of the atomic level @xmath79 shared between the atoms . since the inverse process can not be realized without assistance of the stokes photon , such a state represents a durable atomic entangled state .",
    "it is clear that the above consideration of the atomic entanglement in the multi - atom system can be generalized with easy on the case of raman process in atoms . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath2 phase states similar to ( 16 ) form the class of the maximum entangled atomic states in the case of raman - type processes in the three - level atoms as well .",
    "an evident advantage of the use of the raman process is the long - lived maximum entanglement in atomic subsystem .",
