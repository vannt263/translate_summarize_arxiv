    "in particular , integral  @xcite and fractional  @xcite quantized hall effects still stay at the center of many research activities in different context .",
    "@xcite the integral quantized hall effect ( iqhe ) , observed at two dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) , is attributed to single particle gap formed due to high magnetic field . whereas , the fractional quantized hall effect ( fqhe ) is usually discussed within the frame work of many - body interactions , i.e. the exchange and correlation effects .",
    "@xcite over the years , the role of direct coulomb interaction ( i.e. the hartree potential ) is also shown to be important for the iqhe , due to formation of compressible / incompressible strips .",
    "@xcite here , the electronic system is composed of co - existing metal - like ( compressible ) and insulator - like ( incompressible ) states , where the fermi energy equals to the landau level at the former , and falls in between consecutive levels in the latter .",
    "the semi - classical transport calculations  @xcite and local probe experiments  @xcite prove that , the excess current flows from the incompressible strips by the virtue of their scattering free properties , if their widths are large enough to accommodate at least a single electron .",
    "@xcite this direct coulomb interaction based model of the iqhe is known as the screening theory and is successfully implemented to a number of experimental systems .",
    "@xcite most of the fractional states , can be explained in terms of the iqhe if one replaces electrons by a new particle which is composed of an even number of flux quanta attached to a single electron .",
    "@xcite this mapping is known as the composite fermion picture . in his pioneering work ,",
    "beenakker  @xcite proposed that , the fractional edge states also exist however are very different in their nature compared to the iqhe edge - states . in a later work , chklovskii et al .",
    "@xcite extended their electrostatic picture to show that incompressible strips emerge also in the fractional domain .",
    "there , in contrast to iqhe , the properties of the strips are determined by the many - body effects . the formation and dynamics of the fractional edge states",
    "are investigated in many experiments , of which we mention only two , the magneto - capacitance  @xcite and the edge magneto - plasmon  @xcite measurements , that are related with our discussion . in magneto - capacitance experiments",
    "it is shown that , the widths of the fractional incompressible strips are wider than expected single particle picture of the iqhe . in the edge magneto - plasmon experiments , characteristic deviations at the 2/3 state",
    "is reported , where a large sample is used with top gate .",
    "the estimates of the incompressible strip widths and the density distribution profile is also provided .",
    "these experiments both correspond to a smooth edge profile .",
    "in addition , theoretical semiclassical calculations including many - body effects within a thomas - fermi approximation provide plausible estimates both for the widths of the incompressible strips and edge magneto - plasmon velocities .",
    "however , this approach is mainly limited to smooth edges .    in this communication",
    ", we employ the non - self consistent picture of chklovskii et al .",
    ", together with corrections to electrostatics and wavefunctions , to investigate the co - existence of more than one fractional state at a given magnetic field interval .",
    "such a co - existence of decaying ( evanescent ) incompressible strips is already shown to result in anomalous increase of transverse resistance in the integral domain .",
    "@xcite first , we re - introduce the electrostatic calculation scheme briefly .",
    "then a modification to the charge density profile is introduced , which is motivated by self - consistent calculations .",
    "@xcite next , we use the results of composite fermion picture to determine the energy gaps induced by many - body interactions considering certain fractional states .",
    "we utilize these gaps to investigate the existence of incompressible strips of the corresponding states . focusing on the edge properties of the system , we show that the fractional strips collapse at the samples which exhibit steep density variation .",
    "the collapse is observed once their widths become narrower than the cyclotron radius of the composite fermion associated . despite this fact ,",
    "if the edge density profile is sufficiently smooth such that more than one evanescent incompressible state can co - exist , we predict that an increase in the transverse resistance @xmath2 should be observed .",
    "first , we resemble this effect with the overshooting of the integer quantized hall effect  @xcite and claim that by the help of additional side gates one may enhance the visibility of the measurements by a considerable amount .",
    "second , we show that the recent experimental reports on the local measurements of the energy gaps can be understood within our approach .",
    "@xcite there , it is found that the principle laughlin incompressible strip is missing at the interference pattern .",
    "we also relate our findings with the particle and the quasi - particle interference experiments , where the aharonov - bohm phase of the fractional states are investigated .",
    "in this section we represent the essential findings of the non - self - consistent calculation scheme .",
    "@xcite due to electrostatic stability arguments , it was proposed that the direct coulomb interaction should modify the implausible step - like density profile resulting from non - interacting landauer - buettiker picture .",
    "@xcite in addition , it was shown that the electron density is kept constant within a narrow strip in the close vicinity of the integral ( and the fractional ) filling factors @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnetic length and @xmath5 is the electron density .",
    "these regions are called incompressible , since all the levels below the fermi energy are fully occupied and a discontinuity is encountered if one calculates the variation of the particle number @xmath6 with respect to the chemical potential @xmath7 .",
    "the widths of these regions are determined by the strength of the interactions together with the electrostatic boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite different boundary conditions are discussed in the literature , however , the chklovskii and the gefland  @xcite models are the most known . the former considers a gate defined hall bar , whereas the latter takes into account the chemical etching process .",
    "both models assume translational invariance in the current direction @xmath8 and the 2des to be confined in @xmath9 due to remote donors . a number of self - consistent calculations considering realistic boundary conditions are also available in the literature , which deviate considerably in describing the density profiles from the above mentioned analytical approaches .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the basic idea is to minimize the total energy by the virtue of interactions to achieve an electrostatically stable density distribution , preserving boundary conditions .",

    "the above analytical calculations considering main fractional states via electrostatics , show that one should observe a similar behavior to the overshooting effect in the fractional domain , similar to the integral one .",
    "although , the edge dynamics is intensively studied in experiments  @xcite , up to our knowledge , no systematic investigation of the transport measurements are performed regarding the gate defined narrow samples . whereas , similar samples are used to investigate the incompressible strips at the edge in the integral quantized hall effect regime .",
    "@xcite we found that the smoothness of the edge profile generates complications due to co - existence of well developed fractional incompressible strips .",
    "in addition we show that , it is possible to end in a situation , where observation of the bulk fractional state is hindered .",
    "since our calculations are limited to @xmath107 , the effects discussed above can only be observed at temperatures below 0.5 k and are very sensitive to external parameters , such as current amplitude etc . to protect the fractional overshooting , we suggest to deposit additional metallic gates on the surface parallel to the edges , as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] . applying a negative potential to the additional gates ( smaller than edge defining gates ) will result in reduction of electron density beneath , hence the fast density variation at the edges can be suppressed .",
    "such a smooth density variation will allow us to protect the smearing of outer - most eis .",
    "therefore , one can obtain more than one eis by varying the top gate voltage . in principle the width of the gates should be sufficiently narrow ( e.g. @xmath108 nm ) to avoid variations at the bulk density .    in summary",
    ", we employed the non - self - consistent electrostatic picture of chklovskii et al in the fractional regime with corrections to the density profile and also considering finite width of the wavefunctions .",
    "we used the energy gaps for the fractional states , obtained from composite fermion picture .",
    "we have shown that , if the edge density profile is sufficiently smooth one can obtain the condition @xmath109 ( i.e. the evanescent incompressible strip ) for more than one state .",
    "in such a situation , the total transverse resistance increases depending on the widths of the overlapping strips , resembling the overshooting effect of integer quantized hall effect .",
    "in particular , we found that the co - existence of @xmath96 and @xmath66 states may result in the hindering of the inner bulk state .",
    "such a behavior elucidates the unexpected behavior of missing principle laughlin state at the fabry - perot interference experiments . finally , we proposed a yet un - investigated sample design to enhance the overshooting effect of fractional states utilizing additional surface gates .",
    "we would like to thank m. grayson and a. wild for discussions on the overshooting effect and j. jain for his initiating ideas on utilizing the composite fermion picture in our calculations and a. erzan for her critical questions on this picture , which helped us in improving our understanding .",
