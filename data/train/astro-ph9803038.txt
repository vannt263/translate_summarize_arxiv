    "the reconstruction of projected cluster mass maps from the observable image distortion of faint background galaxies due to the tidal gravitational field is a new and powerful technique . pioneered by kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) , this method has since been modified and generalized to account for ( a ) strong tidal fields in cluster centers ( schneider & seitz 1995 ; seitz & schneider 1995 ; kaiser 1995 ) ; ( b ) finite and  in some cases , e.g.  wfpc2 images  very small data fields ( schneider 1995 ; kaiser et al .  1995 ; bartelmann 1995 ; seitz & schneider 1996 , 1998 ; lombardi & bertin 1998 ) ; and ( c ) the broad redshift distribution of background galaxies ( seitz & schneider 1997 ) . all of these are direct methods in the sense that a local estimate of the tidal field is derived from observed galaxy ellipticities , which is then inserted into an inversion equation to obtain an estimate of the surface mass density of the cluster .",
    "whereas these direct methods are computationally fast , can be treated as black - box routines , need only the observed ellipticities and a smoothing length @xmath0 as input data , and yield fair estimates of the surface mass density , their application has several drawbacks :    * the data must be smoothed , and the smoothing scale is typically a free input parameter specified prior to the mass reconstruction .",
    "there are no objective criteria on how to set the smoothing scale , although some ad - hoc prescriptions for adapting it to the strength of the lensing signal have been given ( seitz et al",
    ".  1996 ) . in general , smoothing leads to an underestimate of the surface mass density in cluster centers or sub - condensations . *",
    "the quality of the reconstruction is hard to quantify .",
    "* constraints on the mass distribution from additional observables ( such as multiple images or giant arcs ) can not simultaneously be included .",
    "in particular , magnification information contained in the number density of background sources ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1995 ; fort et al .",
    "1997 ) or in the image sizes at fixed surface brightness ( bartelmann & narayan 1995 ) , can not be incorporated locally but only globally to break the mass - sheet degeneracy ( gorenstein et al .",
    "1988 ; schneider & seitz 1995 ) .    to overcome these drawbacks , a different class of methods should be used .",
    "bartelmann et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter bnss ) developed a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) technique in which the values of the deflection potential at grid points are considered as free parameters .",
    "after averaging image ellipticities and sizes over grid cells , local estimates of shear and magnification are obtained .",
    "the deflection potential at the grid points is then determined such as to optimally reproduce the observed shear and magnification estimates .",
    "magnification information can be included this way .",
    "the smoothing scale in this method is given by the size of the grid cells , and can be chosen such that the overall @xmath1 of the fit is of order unity per degree of freedom .",
    "squires & kaiser ( 1996 ; hereafter sk ) suggested several inverse methods .",
    "their _ maximum probability method _ parameterizes the mass distribution of the cluster by a set of fourier modes .",
    "if the number of degrees of freedom ( here the number of fourier modes ) is large , the mass model tends to over - fit the data .",
    "this has to be avoided by regularizing the model , for which purpose sk impose a condition on the power spectrum of the fourier modes .",
    "sk s _ maximum - likelihood method _ specifies the surface mass density on a grid and uses the tikhonov - miller regularization ( press et al .",
    "1992 , sect .",
    "the smoothness of the mass reconstructions can be changed by varying the regularization parameter , which is chosen such as to give an overall @xmath2 per degree of freedom .",
    "bridle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have recently proposed an entropy - regularized ml method in which the cluster mass map is parameterized by the surface mass density at grid points .",
    "this method allows to restrict the possible mass maps to such with non - negative surface mass density .",
    "this paper describes another variant of the ml method ( seitz 1997 , ph.d .",
    "the major differences to the previously mentioned inverse methods are the following :    * the observational data ( e.g.  the image ellipticities ) are not smoothed , but each individual ellipticity of a background galaxy is used in the likelihood function .",
    "whereas this modification complicates the implementation of the method , it allows larger spatial resolution for a given number of grid points , which is useful since the latter determines the computing time . *",
    "the number of grid points can be much larger than in bnss , and the likelihood function is regularized .",
    "this produces mass reconstructions of variable smoothness : mass maps are smooth where the data do not demand structure , but show sharp peaks where required by the data .",
    "the resulting spatially varying smoothing scale is a very desirable feature .",
    "fourier methods , such as sk s maximum probability method , have a spatially constant smoothing scale which is determined by the highest - order fourier components . they always need to compromise between providing sufficient resolution near mass peaks and avoiding over - fitting of the data in the outer parts of a cluster .",
    "* following bnss , we use the deflection potential to describe a cluster .",
    "this is an essential difference to bridle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who used the surface mass density at grid points .",
    "as we shall discuss below , working with the deflection potential has substantial fundamental and practical advantages .",
    "we describe our method in sect .  2 , with details given in the appendix .",
    "we then apply the method to synthetic data sets in sects .  3 & 4 to demonstrate its accuracy .",
    "in particular , we compare the performance of our ml method to that of direct methods .",
    "the results are then discussed in sect .  4 , and conclusions are given in sect .  5 , where we also discuss further generalizations of the method for , e.g. , including constraints from strong lensing features .",
    "for simplicity , we assume throughout the paper that all background galaxies are located at the same redshift . a generalization of our technique to a redshift distribution",
    "is given by geiger & schneider ( 1998 ) .",
    "the dimensionless surface mass density @xmath3 is related to the deflection potential @xmath4 through the poisson equation , @xmath5 where indices @xmath6 preceded by a comma denote partial derivatives with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the tidal gravitational field of the lens is described by the shear @xmath8 with the two components @xmath9 thus , the surface mass density and the shear , which determine the local properties of the lens mapping , can _ locally _ be obtained from the deflection potential @xmath10 . in contrast , the relation between shear and surface mass density is highly non - local , @xmath11 with @xmath12 . in particular , @xmath13 needs to be given on the entire two - dimensional plane .",
    "prescribing @xmath13 on a finite field does therefore not completely specify the shear inside the field , because the latter is also affected by the outside mass distribution .",
    "we return to this point further below .",
    "the local magnification is @xmath14}^2-{\\left|\\gamma({\\vec}\\theta)\\right|}^2    \\right\\}}^{-1}\\;. \\label{eq:2.4}\\ ] ]    the local lens equation relates the ellipticities of a source and its image .",
    "we use the complex ellipticity parameter @xmath15 ( see blandford et al .",
    "1991 ) to describe image shapes .",
    "it is generally defined in terms of the tensor @xmath16 of second brightness moments of an image by @xmath17 .",
    "we refer the reader to press et al .",
    "( 1992 , chap .",
    "18 ) for the basic ingredients of the ml method ; see also bridle et al .",
    "we do not repeat the basics here , but describe the application of the method to the cluster mass reconstruction .",
    "we start by considering image ellipticities only ; magnification effects will be discussed later .",
    "let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , denote the complex ellipticities of @xmath20 galaxy images in the data field @xmath21 , which we assume to be a rectangle of side lengths @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we cover the data field with an equidistant grid of @xmath24 points @xmath25 , with @xmath26 in the lower left corner of the data field .",
    "the cluster is described by the deflection potential at the grid points , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . as discussed in bnss , the grid for @xmath10 is larger than the data field by one column or row of grid points in all four directions to allow simple finite differencing of @xmath10 on the whole field @xmath21 .",
    "having found @xmath13 and @xmath30 on all grid points from @xmath10 according to ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) , @xmath13 and @xmath30 are bilinearly interpolated to all galaxy positions @xmath31 .    if the isotropic probability distribution @xmath32 of the intrinsic source ellipticities is given , the probability distribution @xmath33 of the image ellipticities can be predicted . the likelihood function",
    "is then defined as @xmath34 @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , can be maximized with respect to the set @xmath37 of values of the deflection potential at the grid points . since the values of @xmath13 and @xmath30 are obtained from second derivatives of @xmath10 , a constant and a term linear in @xmath38 added to @xmath10 leave @xmath35 unchanged .",
    "in addition , the mass - sheet degeneracy renders @xmath35 invariant under the transformation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an arbitrary parameter ( schneider & seitz 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , in maximizing @xmath35 with respect to @xmath37 , the potential @xmath10 can be held fixed at four grid points . noting that the corners of the @xmath10 grid are not used for the calculation of @xmath13 and @xmath30 on @xmath21 ( see appendix )",
    ", we see that the maximization of @xmath35 has dimension @xmath41 .",
    "provided @xmath42 is not much smaller than the number of galaxies ( which we assume in the following ) , the maximization results in a cluster model which tries to follow closely the noise pattern of the data . disregarding observational effects , the noise is due to the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of the sources .",
    "the reconstructed mass distribution will therefore have pronounced small - scale structure , fitting the observed image ellipticities as closely as possible , and having a @xmath1 per degree of freedom much smaller than unity . in order to prevent such over - fitting of the data ,",
    "we need to augment @xmath35 by a regularization term . instead of maximizing @xmath36 ,",
    "we minimize @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a function of the potential that disfavors strong small - scale fluctuations .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 determines how much weight should be attached to smoothness .",
    "one can vary @xmath45 such that the resulting reconstruction has approximately the expected deviation from the data , viz .",
    "@xmath2 per degree of freedom .",
    "larger values of @xmath45 yield mass distributions which are too smooth to fit the data , lower values of @xmath45 cause over - fitting .",
    "we experimented with quite a large number of regularization terms .",
    "for example , we chose @xmath44 as the sum of @xmath46 over all grid points .",
    "mass reconstructions from synthetic data ( see sect .  3 below ) then showed a strong tendency to decrease too slowly towards the outer parts of the cluster , for that regularization preferred @xmath13 to be as flat as possible .",
    "regularizations including higher - order derivatives of @xmath13 ( see press et al .  1992 ,",
    "18.5 ) led to similar artifacts .",
    "thus , such local linear regularizations were dismissed as unsatisfactory .",
    "motivated by the success of the maximum - entropy ( me ) image deconvolution ( e.g.  narayan & nityananda 1986 ; lucy 1994 ) , we consider instead me regularizations of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48}^{-1}\\,\\kappa_{ij } \\label{eq:2.9}\\ ] ] is the normalized surface mass density at the grid points , and @xmath49 is a similarly normalized prior distribution ( see press et al .",
    "1992 , sect .",
    "18.7 , for a detailed discussion of the me method ) .",
    "we experimented with different choices for the prior .",
    "on the whole , a uniform prior , @xmath50 , performed satisfactorily , but tended to smooth mass peaks more than desired .",
    "following lucy ( 1994 ) , we therefore use a prior which is determined by the data itself . deferring details to sect .  3 , we note here that one can use the mass distribution obtained from a direct ( finite field ) reconstruction method as an initial prior , then iteratively minimize @xmath51 , and after several iterations use a smoothed version of the current mass distribution as a new prior .",
    "lucy ( 1994 ) showed that such a moving prior yields more accurate reconstructions than a constant prior .",
    "the regularization parameter @xmath45 can be iteratively adjusted to provide the expected goodness - of - fit .",
    "note that the me regularization ensures that the reconstructed surface mass distribution is positive definite .",
    "given the intrinsic ellipticity distribution and the local values of @xmath13 and @xmath30 , the probability distribution @xmath52 for the image ellipticities can be calculated . however , the resulting analytic expressions are quite cumbersome and unsuitable for the high - dimensional minimization problem considered here . with the intrinsic distribution",
    "not being accurately known anyway , a precise expression of @xmath52 is not needed .",
    "we therefore approximate the image ellipticity distribution by a gaussian , with mean @xmath53 and dispersion @xmath54 .",
    "both these values depend on the ( local ) distortion , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the reduced shear .",
    "mean and dispersion can be approximated by ( schneider & seitz 1995 ) @xmath57}\\delta\\;,\\nonumber\\\\    \\sigma_\\chi & = & \\sigma_0{\\left(1-{\\left|\\delta\\right|}^2\\right)}^{\\mu_2}\\ ; , \\label{eq:2.11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the @xmath60-th moment of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution . using ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) , the function @xmath51 to be minimized",

    "( see bbns ) rather than the ellipticity @xmath15 , then @xmath67 ( seitz & schneider 1997 ) for a non - critical cluster . in the general case including critical clusters , the variable @xmath15 is more convenient . ]",
    "the term @xmath68 in @xmath51 has the form of a @xmath1-function , which implies that an acceptable mass model should have @xmath69 .",
    "this condition constrains the regularization parameter @xmath45 .",
    "we outline in the appendix an efficient method for calculating @xmath51 and its derivatives with respect to the values of @xmath10 on the grid points .",
    "we note that the terms in the sums of ( [ eq:2.13 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.14 ] ) corresponding to a galaxy at @xmath70 depend only on the values of @xmath10 at neighboring grid points . in that sense ,",
    "our method is local .",
    "had we parameterized the cluster by @xmath13 at grid points , each term in the sums depended on @xmath13 at all grid points , as can be seen from ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .",
    "it becomes obvious that the description in terms of @xmath10 requires much less computer time .",
    "in addition , the use of @xmath13 rather than @xmath10 is strongly disfavored by the fact that the shear on @xmath21 is incompletely specified by @xmath13 on the same field .",
    "bridle et al.(1998 ) attack this problem by performing the reconstruction on a region much larger than @xmath21 .",
    "they find that the shear information within @xmath21 yields information about @xmath13 outside @xmath21 .",
    "although this is true , the information on the mass outside the data field is _ very _ limited : for a circular data field , the shear inside @xmath21 caused by mass outside @xmath21 can be fully described by conveniently defined multipole moments of the mass distribution outside @xmath21 ( schneider & bartelmann 1997 ) , and there are infinitely many mass distributions for which all of those multipole moments agree .",
    "for instance , a point mass located just outside the data field produces the same shear pattern in the field as a spherically symmetric mass distribution with the same total mass . finally , extending the region on which the reconstruction is performed increases the dimensionality of the minimization problem .",
    "the mass - sheet degeneracy ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) can be lifted if the lens magnification can be estimated .",
    "three different methods for measuring magnification were suggested in the literature .",
    "broadhurst et al.(1995 ) proposed to use the magnification bias , which changes the local number density of background galaxies due to the magnification , provided the slope of the number counts @xmath71 is sufficiently different from @xmath72 .",
    "noting that lensing magnifies objects but leaves their surface brightness unchanged , bartelmann & narayan ( 1995 ) suggested that the sizes of background galaxies at fixed surface brightness could be a convenient measure for the magnification after calibrating with field galaxies .",
    "both methods can be used locally or globally . in the first case ,",
    "the local magnification information is used for the mass reconstruction , whereas in the latter case , the transformation parameter @xmath73 in ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) is adjusted until the magnification optimally matches the observational estimate .",
    "kolatt & bartelmann ( 1998 ) suggested to calibrate @xmath73 globally by using type - ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles .",
    "if magnification information is taken into account , the potential @xmath10 can be kept fixed at three points only , yielding @xmath74 .    as an example , consider the method suggested by bartelmann & narayan ( 1995 ) .",
    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be the ratios of the linear sizes of a galaxy and its image , respectively , relative to the mean size of galaxies with the same surface brightness .",
    "they are related by @xmath77 .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "hence , if @xmath80 is the probability distribution for @xmath75 , the local probability distribution for @xmath76 is @xmath81 including the size distribution into the likelihood maximization leads to an additional term in ( [ eq:2.13 ] ) , @xmath82 } +    \\eta\\,{{\\cal r}}{\\left({\\left\\{\\psi\\right\\}}\\right)}\\ ; , \\label{eq:2.16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 we assume @xmath84 to be a log - normal distribution ( cf .",

    "hence , @xmath89 is a gaussian in @xmath90 , with dispersion @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 has the form of a @xmath1 function in @xmath90 , which motivates us to include the factor @xmath93 in the definition of @xmath92 .",
    "a satisfactory mass model should have @xmath94 .",
    "note that the galaxies whose size can reliably be measured need not be those used for measuring the shear .",
    "it is just for notational simplicity that we assume that the two galaxy populations agree .",
    "for minimizing ( [ eq:2.13 ] ) or ( [ eq:2.16 ] ) in the process of the ml mass reconstruction , the various quantities ( e.g.  @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath95 ) need to be calculated for each set of values @xmath37 of the deflection potential .",
    "we outline in the appendix how this can be done efficiently . in order to quickly approach the minimum of @xmath51",
    ", we use derivative information in the minimization procedure .",
    "the derivative of @xmath51 with respect to @xmath27 is also given in the appendix .",
    "we employ the conjugate gradient method as encoded in the routine frprmn by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , with line minimization using derivative information .",
    "we need a good initial potential to start the minimization .",
    "we tested two different approaches .",
    "the first starts with a relatively small grid ( say , @xmath96 for a quadratic data field @xmath21 ) , and a potential which corresponds to a constant surface mass density of @xmath97 , say .",
    "@xmath45 can be set to zero initially because the large grid cells provide sufficient smoothing to avoid over - fitting the data , or otherwise set @xmath45 to a small value with a constant prior .",
    "after several ( 20 , say ) iterations , the current mass map is smoothed and used as the new prior , and the minimization is continued .",
    "the regularization parameter is slightly increased or decreased , depending on whether @xmath68 is smaller or larger than unity .",
    "once a stable minimum with @xmath98 is obtained , the solution can be interpolated to a finer grid ( @xmath99 , say ) and the minimization can continue , adapting the prior and the regularization parameter as described before .",
    "this procedure can be repeated if desired .",
    "the second approach starts on a fine grid right away , with initial conditions obtained from a direct finite - field reconstruction method like that described by seitz & schneider ( 1998 ) . from this mass distribution",
    ", an approximate deflection potential can be found by integration , although any contribution from the mass outside the data field will be missing in the resulting @xmath10 .",
    "this initial prior is a smoothed version of the mass map from the direct reconstruction , and is adapted as described above .",
    "if there is no mass concentration directly outside the data field , the second method converges faster , while the first approach should be used if the data field does not encompass most of the mass concentration .",
    "of course , both methods finally approach solutions with @xmath98 . if magnification information is available , @xmath92 should finally approximate unity , which provides a useful consistency check of the result .",

    "the choice of the regularization parameter results in @xmath68 being slightly smaller than unity on average , though with substantial variation from case to case .",
    "evidently , @xmath120 is significantly smaller in the inner part than in the outer part , an effect also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] where the true mass distribution was considered .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ellipticity distribution after lensing is not really a gaussian , and the deviation from this assumed functional form becomes larger for larger values of the reduced shear , i.e.  closer to the center of @xmath21 . whereas there is no fundamental difficulty in replacing the gaussian with a more accurate probability distribution ,",
    "the simple form for @xmath68 is computationally convenient and seems to be sufficiently accurate for the mass reconstructions , as seen from the dash - dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the deviation of @xmath121 from unity can be substantial in individual reconstructions , but the mean over all realizations is very close to unity .    at the edge of the data field , two systematic effects become visible in the mean quantities plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:3]d  f ( and also by looking at the 2-d distribution over @xmath21 ) : the value of @xmath120 shows a small but significant decrease , and @xmath13 is slightly too large near the boundary .",
    "the first of these effects can be understood by considering the number of galaxies for which the shear estimate is affected if the value of @xmath10 is changed at a grid point . if that grid point is located in the inner part of @xmath21 , the estimates of @xmath30 for galaxies within the neighboring 16 grid cells are affected .",
    "this number decreases for points near the boundary of @xmath21 , so that @xmath10 there is less constrained by the measured image ellipticities .",
    "this implies that at the boundary , it is easier to `` fit the noise '' caused by the intrinsic ellipticity distribution .",
    "the slightly too large @xmath13 near the boundary is due to the prior .",
    "the prior is obtained from local averaging of the current mass distribution .",
    "if the mass distribution decreases outwards , the local mean value which can only be taken from the grid points within @xmath21 will be slightly too large at the boundary , which explains why the method presented here is slightly biasing the mass map at the boundary . in actual applications ,",
    "a strip of width @xmath115 can be ignored in the analysis of the mass distribution if this bias is a worry . however , its amplitude is very small , and it can probably be safely ignored in most situations compared to the stochastic errors .",
    "alternatively , one can use a mild extrapolation of the smoothed mass distribution to obtain an estimate of the smoothed @xmath13 values on the boundary less affected by this bias . in the case of our mass model , a simple fix ( instead of a more elaborated extrapolation )",
    "can be obtained by decreasing @xmath13 by @xmath122 on all boundary points , which practically eliminates the bias .",
    "we use this simple fix to the simulations discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we further point out that the amplitude of this mass bias can also be checked with real data , by generating artificial data sets from the reconstructed mass distribution and by performing reconstructions for those in the same way in which the original mass reconstruction was obtained .",
    "the mass - sheet transformation ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) allows to determine the quantity @xmath123 $ ] up to an additive constant . as in seitz & schneider ( 1996 , 1998 ;",
    "sk ) , we perform a power - spectrum analysis of the difference between @xmath124 and @xmath125 , i.e.  between the @xmath126 from the ml reconstructions and from the true mass distribution .",
    "note that this power spectrum for @xmath127 is independent of the transformation ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we compare the power spectrum obtained from our 50 realizations to the power spectrum obtained from the difference between @xmath128 and @xmath125 , the former one corresponding to the noise - filter mass reconstruction of seitz & schneider ( 1996 ) , using the same realizations of the galaxy population .",
    "as can easily be seen , the ml reconstruction yields substantially lower values for @xmath129 than the noise - filter reconstruction .    for illuminating the main reason for this difference , we also calculate the power spectra of the difference between @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath125 , the former two being the mean reconstructed mass distribution averaged over all 50 realizations .",
    "the difference between these two power spectra is very large , with the power of @xmath132 being much larger than for the ml reconstructions .",
    "almost the entire difference comes from the inability of the noise - filter method to resolve the core of the two mass peaks in the model appropriately because of the unavoidable smoothing .",
    "note that the smoothing scale @xmath133 in the noise - filter reconstruction is much larger than the smoothing scale @xmath115 for the prior in the ml method , the latter being of the same order as the size of a grid cell , or the mean separation between two background galaxy images , which in any case is smallest scale one can hope to resolve .",
    "in fact , it seems that the power spectrum of @xmath134 is approximately the sum of the power spectra of @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in other words ,",
    "the error of the noise - filter reconstruction is due to a systematic error ( from smoothing , although it is adaptive smoothing as in seitz & schneider 1996 ) , and a stochastic error which is approximately the same as that for the ml reconstruction .",
    "the power spectrum of the error resulting from finite differencing is shown as the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and is seen to be about the same as that of @xmath137 .",
    "i.e. , the largest part of the error of the mean mass map in the ml reconstruction comes from finite differencing ; only for @xmath138 is the latter error larger than that from finite differencing .",
    "this little power excess is due to the aforementioned slight bias at the boundary of @xmath21 .    to conclude this subsection",
    ", we have shown that the ml method yields more accurate mass reconstructions than the noise - filter method , whereby the largest difference is due to the better angular resolution of the ml method in those parts of the data field where the data require more local structure , whereas the noise - filter method ",
    "like all direct methods developed so far  uses a fixed smoothing scale , or at best an ad - hoc choice for the change of smoothing scale with the signal , such as in seitz et al .",
    "( 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the ml mass distributions are slightly biased at the boundary of the data field , and the amplitude of this bias depends on the mass distribution .",
    "for the 50 realizations of the background galaxies , we also performed ml mass reconstructions including magnification information , i.e.  minimizing ( [ eq:2.16 ] ) .",
    "each reconstruction proceeded as described in the beginning of sect .",
    "4.1 , except that the regularization parameter was chosen to be @xmath139 instead of 30 .",
    "this is necessary to give the regularization the same weight as before , because the chi - square part of @xmath51 is now effectively doubled .",
    "the number of iteration steps was slightly increased to 1200 . anticipating that the additional magnification information would allow a slightly higher angular resolution of the mass map",
    ", we somewhat reduced the smoothing scale for the prior to @xmath140 .    in analogy to fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the quantities ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) and ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) for three different realizations of the galaxy population , their average over 50 realizations , and their dispersion . comparing the two figures",
    ", it seems that including magnification information does not change the curves significantly , apart from the fact that the mass - sheet transformation is now obsolete .",
    "magnification information therefore mainly affects the normalization of the mass map , but does not provide significant information on its shape .",
    "to further illustrate this point , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] the power spectra of the difference between reconstructed mass maps @xmath124 and the model mass distribution @xmath125 , similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the difference in the power spectra between reconstructions with and without magnification information is much smaller than their difference to the noise - filter mass reconstructions , at least for small values of @xmath141 . for larger",
    "@xmath65 , the difference becomes somewhat larger , but this may simply be due to the different choice of the regularization parameter which affects the small - scale noise . in our model , these small scales are only noise because the mass model is relatively smooth .",
    "the power spectra of the ensemble - averaged mass maps show that the spectrum for simulations with magnification information is somewhat lower .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the magnification information leads to a slightly better angular resolution in the core of the two mass concentrations .",
    "our simulation results therefore allow to conclude that magnification information does not contribute much information on the _ shape _ of the mass distribution compared to shear information . for estimating the relative accuracy of the mass determination",
    ", one can then assume that the mass map is known from the galaxy shapes up to the mass - sheet transformation .",
    "let @xmath13 be the true mass distribution and @xmath142 the distribution transformed with ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) .",
    "the magnification information can then be used to determine @xmath73 such as to best fit the galaxy sizes , i.e.  to minimize @xmath92 . noting that ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) transforms magnifications like @xmath143 , the best - fitting @xmath73 is @xmath144}{\\ln r(k)-{\\left|\\mu({\\vec}\\theta_k)\\right|}^{1/2}}\\;. \\label{eq:4.2}\\ ] ] since the distribution of the @xmath90 is gaussian , the values of @xmath145 for different realizations of the galaxy population follow a gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and dispersion @xmath146 . whereas the distribution of @xmath145 is symmetric about zero , the mean of @xmath73 is not unity .",
    "the ratio @xmath147 of the estimated mass to the true mass has a median of unity , but a slightly smaller mean , @xmath148 the deviation of @xmath149 from unity is very small : for @xmath150 and @xmath107 , and a mass model with @xmath151 , we find @xmath152 .",
    "similarly , the dispersion of @xmath153 is @xmath154 where we have used @xmath155 in the approximations . for the same parameters as before , @xmath156 .",
    "we therefore expect that our mass model can be reconstructed with an accuracy of about 6% if the shape of the mass distribution is sufficiently constrained by image shapes .",
    "[ fig:5]d shows that this estimate in very good agreement with the mass estimate obtained from the ml reconstruction using the magnification information .    to elaborate on this point , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] the ratios of four different mass estimates to the true mass .",
    "these are : the mass from ml reconstructions ( i ) with and ( ii ) without magnification information , but transformed according to ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) to best fit the source sizes ; ( iii ) mass - sheet - transformed noise - filter reconstructions ; and ( iv ) the mass - sheet - transformed true density distribution . obviously , the scatter of the mass estimates across the four different methods is very much smaller than that caused by different realizations of the source population . as much as 50 realizations allow to conclude , all four methods yield an unbiased estimate of the total mass and have approximately the same dispersion , close to the theoretical expectation discussed above .",
    "we investigated how the quality of mass estimates is affected by the spatial resolution .",
    "the noise - filter reconstructions have a lower resolution than the ml reconstructions , although our adaptive smoothing makes them satisfactorily resolve the mass peaks .",
    "we performed noise - filter reconstructions with fixed smoothing scales of @xmath157 and @xmath158 . in those cases ,",
    "the peaks are fairly much smoothed out . applying then ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) to match image sizes",
    ", we found that the total mass within @xmath21 is systematically overestimated , by @xmath159% and @xmath160% , respectively .",
    "this is because the smoothing of the map renders the model magnification too low to match the observed high magnifications close to mass peaks , for which the invariance transformation tends to compensate with a slightly higher mass .",
    "this bias also affects the ml reconstruction of bnss because of missing resolution in the cluster center .",
    "however , it is sufficiently small to be not of much practical importance for reconstructions which can be expected from real data in the near future , but it should be kept in mind if a large sample of clusters is investigated statistically .",
    "we presented a new method for reconstructing projected mass distributions of galaxy clusters .",
    "the method uses image distortions of background galaxies and their size as a function of surface brightness .",
    "our entropy - regularized ml method ( seitz 1997 ) is a further development of previously published inverse methods for the mass reconstruction . in particular , we describe the lens by its deflection potential @xmath10 as suggested by bnss .",
    "this is of major importance , for two reasons .",
    "first , if the surface mass density @xmath13 on a finite field @xmath21 is used to describe the lens , the shear on @xmath21 is incompletely specified by the model because the mass distribution outside @xmath21 can contribute to the shear .",
    "second , the shear at the position of any galaxy depends only locally on @xmath10 , which allows a much faster minimization algorithm for a given number of grid points .",
    "we regularize the method by an entropy term as suggested by bridle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but additionally adapt the prior to the current model of the mass distribution .",
    "this ` moving prior ' ( lucy 1994 ) allows a considerably higher resolution of mass peaks .",
    "the spatial resolution of the entropy - regularized ml method adapts itself to the strength of the lensing signal , producing mass distributions which are as smooth as possible , and as structured as the data require . in that respect ,",
    "our method differs from that of bnss and sk .",
    "we showed that the ml method is superior to the noise - filter method ( seitz & schneider 1996 ) which was the most accurate of the presently known direct inversion methods ( seitz & schneider 1996 , 1998 ; sk ; lombardi & bertin 1998 ) .",
    "obviously , the method described here is not restricted to rectangular data fields , but can easily be adapted to any geometry of @xmath21 by covering @xmath21 with quadratic grid cells , and adding a boundary of grid points for @xmath10  the rest is only a matter of labeling .",
    "furthermore , we note that observational errors can be incorporated into the likelihood function .",
    "for example , if the measurement error of the ellipticity @xmath15 is @xmath161 , one can replace @xmath162 in ( [ eq:2.13 ] and [ eq:2.14 ] ) by @xmath163 .",
    "in contrast to the direct inversion methods , all of which are variants and generalizations of the original kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) method , the inverse methods allow to include additional information on top of the shear measured through image ellipticities .",
    "we demonstrated this here by adding magnification information derived from image sizes at given surface brightness , as discussed by bartelmann & narayan ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , we could equally well use the change of number counts due to magnification bias ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1995 ) as an additional constraint .",
    "in that case , if the number counts of a certain ( e.g.  color - selected ) galaxy population have a cumulative slope of @xmath164 , the expected number density of background galaxies at a position @xmath38 is @xmath165 , where @xmath166 are the counts at the same flux limit in the absence of lensing .",
    "assuming that galaxies are intrinsically randomly distributed , the probability of having @xmath167 galaxies within @xmath21 is a poisson distribution @xmath168 with @xmath169 consequently , the likelihood function could be augmented by a factor @xmath170 if galaxy clustering is important , the likelihood @xmath171 can not be written as a simple product over individual galaxies , but the joint probability distributions must be taken into account .",
    "the contribution of clustering effects to the likelihood function is somewhat uncertain , because an approximate expression has to be used due to lack of knowledge on the @xmath167-point correlation functions ( see broadhurst et al .",
    "1995 for further discussion ) .",
    "perhaps the most promising generalization of our method is the inclusion of strong lensing constraints .",
    "since giant arcs and multiple images of background galaxies provide ( nearly ) exact constraints on the lens mass distribution , it is highly desirable to include them into a mass reconstruction .",
    "the obvious way to do this would be to augment the function @xmath51 by a term which measures the degree to which multiple images of the same source are mapped back to the same position in the source plane . in addition , the surface brightness profile of multiple images of extended sources can be incorporated , e.g.  in a similar manner as the spatially resolved multiple arc in the cluster cl0024 + 16 ( colley at al .",
    "1996 ) .    in some of the observed clusters ,",
    "the lensing effects of individual galaxies are visible , in particular through deformations of giant arcs .",
    "some of the most prominent examples are the triple arc in 0024 + 16 ( kassiola et al .",
    "1992 ) , the multiple arc systems in a  2218 ( kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the distortion of the curvature in the arc of the galaxy cb58 in ms1512 + 36 ( seitz et al .",
    "1998 ) . but",
    "even weaker lensing effects of individual ( cluster ) galaxies can be detected using a combination of cluster mass reconstruction and galaxy - galaxy lensing techniques . by adding two free parameters to the lens model , such as the mass - to - light ratio of cluster galaxies and their characteristic spatial extent , the size of halos of cluster galaxies can be investigated ( natarayan et al .",
    "1997 ; geiger & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "this work was supported by the `` sonderforschungsbereich 375 - 95 '' fr astro - teilchenphysik der deutschen forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "we outline here how the function @xmath51  see ( [ eq:2.13 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.16 ] )  can be calculated from the deflection potential @xmath37 at the grid points .",
    "we first note that @xmath51 can be easily calculated in terms of the shear @xmath30 and the surface mass density @xmath13 at the position of the galaxies @xmath31 , and in terms of @xmath13 at the grid points , which enters into the regularization term @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath172 label the deflection potential at the @xmath42 grid points where @xmath10 is varied .",
    "if no magnification information is used , @xmath41 , and @xmath173 otherwise .",
    "the components of @xmath30 and @xmath13 at the @xmath174 grid points are obtained by second - order finite differencing , according to ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) . for calculating @xmath175 at the grid corners",
    ", we used the finite - difference formula ( 25.3.27 ) from abramowitz & stegun ( 1984 ) so that @xmath10 at the corner points of the extended grid does not enter @xmath51 .",
    "this can be important because the corner points do not enter the entropy term , so that they are not regularized .",
    "if no galaxy happens to lie in the corner grid cells , these points would be unconstrained .",
    "finite differencing being a linear operation , we can write @xmath176 summation over @xmath177 , @xmath178 , is implied , and the array @xmath179 accounts for the contribution to @xmath180 from the grid points where @xmath10 is held constant . for each galaxy position @xmath31 , the values of @xmath13 and @xmath30 are obtained from bilinear interpolation from the closest grid points . since interpolation is again a linear operation , we can write @xmath181 for @xmath19 .",
    "the arrays @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 again arise from the contributions of the grid points where @xmath10 is held fixed .",
    "if magnification information is used , @xmath10 is kept fixed at three grid points , where @xmath185 can be chosen without loss of generality ; then , @xmath186 .",
    "if magnification information is neglected , at least one of the four constant values of @xmath10 has to differ from zero , and @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath187 are not identically zero , although most of their elements vanish .",
    "the same holds for the elements of the matrices @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 . whereas the dimension of these matrices is large , only about @xmath192 elements are different from zero .",
    "thus , we store these matrices using the row - indexed sparse storage mode , as described in press et al .",
    "( 1992 , sect .",
    "note that these matrices and ` vectors ' have to be calculated only once , since they depend only on the number of grid points and the location of the galaxies .",
    "the sparseness of the matrices is one of the advantages to work in terms of the deflection potential rather than the surface mass density .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath193 , we note that for any function @xmath194 at @xmath31 , @xmath195 for the regularization term , we find @xmath196}^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\    & \\times & \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n_x n_y}\\ ,    \\ln{\\left(\\hat\\kappa_\\mu\\over b_\\mu\\right)}\\ ,    { \\left[d_{\\mu\\alpha}-\\hat\\kappa_\\mu\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{n_x n_y}\\ ,    d_{\\nu\\alpha}\\right]}\\;. \\label{eq : a4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these relations , the function @xmath51 and its derivative with respect to the @xmath172 are easily calculated .",
    "an additional complication arises for a critical lens .",
    "as can be seen from the explicit form of the terms of @xmath51 , the likelihood function attains singularities if a galaxy image happens to lie on a critical curve where @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "this means that the minimization procedure can not modify the model such that critical curves move over galaxy positions .",
    "since the initial guess of @xmath10 will certainly not be accurate enough that such crossings can be avoided , we have to modify the function @xmath51 appropriately .",
    "the necessary modification of @xmath51 can be achieved by replacing @xmath199 by @xmath200}^{-1/2}$ ] , and @xmath54 by @xmath201 , where @xmath202 and @xmath45 are two small quantities .",
    "these replacements leave @xmath51 finite if a galaxy image is placed on a critical curve .",
    "the minimization then proceeds by setting @xmath202 and @xmath45 to about 0.1 at the beginning of the minimization , and then slowly decreasing them in later iteration steps .",
    "this leads to convergence without additional problems .",
    "in addition , as was true for the direct inversions , by considering a broad redshift distribution of the background galaxies ( seitz & schneider 1997 ) , the singularities connected with critical curves are avoided ( geiger & schneider 1998 ) .",
