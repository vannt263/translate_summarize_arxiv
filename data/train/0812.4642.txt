    "both @xmath5 and @xmath0 are assumed to be canonical [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] . in this case ,",
    "the code - trellis module associated with @xmath5 and the error - trellis modules [ 6 ] associated with the syndrome former @xmath9 ( @xmath10 means transpose ) have @xmath11 states , where the obvious realization of @xmath5 and the adjoint - obvious realization [ 3 ] of @xmath9 are assumed , respectively .",
    "ariel and snyders [ 1 ] presented a construction of an error - trellis based on the scalar check matrix derived from @xmath0 .",
    "they showed that when some ( @xmath12th ) `` column '' of @xmath0 has a factor @xmath13 ( i.e. , the @xmath12th column is not `` delay free '' ) , there is a possibility that state - space reduction can be realized .",
    "being motivated by their work , we also examined the same case .",
    "we took notice of a syndrome generation process .",
    "the time-@xmath14 error @xmath15 and the time-@xmath14 syndrome @xmath16 are connected with the relation @xmath17 . from this relation ,",
    "we noticed [ 8 ] that the transformation @xmath18 is equivalent to dividing the @xmath12th column of @xmath0 by @xmath13 .",
    "that is , reduction can be accomplished by shifting the `` subsequence '' @xmath19 of the original error - path .    on the other hand , consider the parity - check matrix @xmath20 since @xmath21 is canonical and all the columns are delay free , any further reduction seems to be impossible .",
    "in fact , it follows from _ theorem 1 _ of [ 1 ] that the dimension @xmath22 of the state space of the error - trellis based on @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "however , a corresponding generator matrix is given by @xmath25 .",
    "note that the third column of @xmath26 has a factor @xmath27 .",
    "( _ remark : _ it suffices to divide the third column by @xmath27 in order to obtain a reduced code - trellis . )",
    "this fact implies that a reduced error - trellis can be constructed [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] ( i.e. , state - space reduction can be realized ) .",
    "then consider the reciprocal dual encoder [ 4 ] @xmath28 note that the third column of @xmath29 has a factor @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , dividing the third column of @xmath29 by @xmath27 , we can construct an error - trellis with @xmath24 states ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] . here , notice that each error - path in the error - trellis based on @xmath23 can be represented in time - reversed order using the error - trellis based on @xmath31 .",
    "hence , a factor @xmath27 in the column of @xmath29 corresponds to backward - shifting by two time units ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) in terms of the original @xmath21 .",
    "actually , by `` multiplying '' the third column of @xmath21 by @xmath27 , we have @xmath33 note that this matrix can be reduced to an equivalent canonical parity - check matrix @xmath34 by dividing the first `` row '' by @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the dimension @xmath22 can be reduced to @xmath35 .",
    "( _ remark : _ this fact can not be derived from the results of [ 1 ] . ) it follows from the above argument that there is a possibility that a reduced error - trellis can be constructed not only using forward - shifted error subsequences but also using backward - shifted error subsequences .",
    "now , we remark that a parity - check matrix @xmath0 with the form described above appears in [ 10 ] .",
    "tanner et al . [ 10 ] presented a class of algebraically constructed quasi - cyclic ( qc ) ldpc codes and their convolutional counterparts .",
    "it is stated that the convolutional codes obtained in the paper typically have large constraint lengths and therefore the use of trellis - based decoding is not feasible . however , the parity - check matrices of ldpc convolutional codes proposed by tanner et al .",
    "have monomial entries .",
    "accordingly , the above - mentioned state - space reduction method can be directly applied to those parity - check matrices .",
    "then we intended to evaluate the state - space complexity of the error - trellis of an ldpc convolutional code which appears in [ 10 ] .",
    "we show that the _ overall constraint length _ ( abbreviated as `` ocl '' in this paper ) of the parity - check matrix which specifies an ldpc convolutional code can be significantly reduced with the error - correction capability of the convolutional code being preserved .",
    "let @xmath0 be a parity - check matrix for an @xmath36 convolutional code @xmath7 . in this paper , we consider the error - trellis based on the syndrome former @xmath9 . in this case",
    ", the adjoint - obvious realization of @xmath9 is assumed unless otherwise specified .",

    "since the columns of @xmath63 are delay free , the dimension @xmath64 of the state space of the error - trellis based on the syndrome former @xmath65 is given by @xmath35 ( see _ theorem 1 _ of [ 1 ] ) .",

    "we observe that each error - path in fig.2 ( restricted to the section @xmath85 $ ] ) is represented in fig.1 in time - reversed order .",
    "that is , the original error - paths can be represented using the error - trellis associated with the corresponding reciprocal dual encoder .    on the other hand , dividing the third column of @xmath86 by @xmath87 , we have the reduced canonical parity - check matrix @xmath88 in this case [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , error - paths associated with @xmath81 can be represented using the error - trellis constructed based on @xmath89 .",
    "note that a factor @xmath13 in the column of @xmath90 corresponds to backward - shifting by @xmath91 time units ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) in terms of the original @xmath0 .",

    "each circulant in the parity - check matrix of a qc block code can be specified by a unique polynomial ; the polynomial represents the entries in the first column of the circulant matrix . for example , a circulant matrix whose first column is @xmath93^t$ ] is represented by the polynomial @xmath94 . using this correspondence , an ldpc convolutional code",
    "is constructed based on a parity - check matrix @xmath1 of a given qc code [ 10 ] .",
    "for example [ 10 ] , let @xmath95 be the parity - check matrix of a @xmath96 qc code ( @xmath97 ) , where @xmath98 is a @xmath99 identity matrix with rows shifted cyclically to the left by @xmath100 positions . from @xmath1 we obtain the following parity - check matrix with polynomial entries : @xmath101 ( _ remark : _ it is stated [ 10 ] that the ldpc convolutional code is obtained by _ unwrapping the constraint graph ( i.e. , tanner graph ) _ of the qc code . ) note that the polynomials in @xmath0 are all monomials . in this paper",

    "the resulting matrix is given by @xmath104 clearly , the qc block code and its associated constraint graph are unaffected by these row shifts .",
    "however , the convolutional code obtained based on the above procedure has the parity - check matrix @xmath105 we see that @xmath2 is not equivalent to @xmath0 .",
    "two convolutional codes specified by @xmath0 and @xmath2 are in fact different .",
    "we also remark that @xmath0 and @xmath2 have different monomial entries and accordingly , when row / column factors are factored out , the resulting matrices have different ocls .    on the other hand",
    ", we have the following important fact [ 10 ] :    _ property : _ the ldpc convolutional codes obtained by unwrapping the constraint graph of the qc codes have their free distance @xmath106 lower - bounded by the minimum distance @xmath107 of the corresponding qc code .",
    "it is shown that the qc code associated with @xmath1 has a minimum distance @xmath108 .",

    "again , take the parity - check matrix @xmath1 given by eq.(23 ) . here",
    ", let us cyclically shift the first block of @xmath102 rows above by one position",

    "when we apply cyclic shifts to the rows of each block of the original @xmath1 , the resulting @xmath0 can be specified by a pattern @xmath121^t$ ] .",
    "for example , consider the pattern @xmath122^t$ ] .",

    "eq.(24 ) ) is given by @xmath123 since row operations have been done , let us apply column operations .",
    "then we have @xmath124 we see that this is equivalent to the transformation from @xmath125 to @xmath126 where subtraction is performed in each column of @xmath127 in order that the minimum is equal to zero . from @xmath128 , the ocl of the reduced @xmath2 is obtained as @xmath129 .",
    ".,width=283 ]    .,width=283 ]    as we have seen in the previous section , there are @xmath130 patterns in total . by applying column operations to each pattern",
    ", we examined the ocl @xmath131 of the corresponding reduced parity - check matrix @xmath2 .",
    "the result is shown in fig.3 , where the horizontal axis represents the ocl @xmath131 and the vertical axis represents its frequency .",
    "observe that the minimum ocl @xmath132 is @xmath133 , whereas the maximum ocl @xmath134 is @xmath135 .",
    "that is , the values of @xmath131 cover a wide range .",
    "next , based on the argument in section ii - b , we examined the ocl @xmath136 using the reciprocal dual encoder @xmath90 associated with @xmath0 . the result is shown in fig.4 .",
    "we have @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "note that in this example , the minimum ocl is further reduced using a reciprocal dual encoder .",
    "moreover , after having applied row / column operations to each @xmath0 ( denote by @xmath2 the resulting matrix ) , we took its reciprocal version @xmath139 .",
    "then again applying row / column operations to @xmath139 , we examined the ocl @xmath140 of the resulting matrix . using this method",
    ", we have further reduction with respect to the value of @xmath131 .",
    "the result is shown in fig.5 .",
    "we observe that the maximum reduction @xmath141 of @xmath142 is realized .",
    "we remark that @xmath143 is reduced to @xmath144 using this method .          our aim is the reduction of the ocl of a parity - check matrix @xmath0 . since row operations have been done in a pattern @xmath121^t$ ]",
    ", it is desirable for figures in each column to be close together ( i.e. , the difference @xmath145 between the maximum and the minimum in the @xmath12th column is small ) . in this case , each figure in the column becomes small after the column operation , which finally leads to the reduction of the ocl .",
    "hence , we search for a pattern in which every column has @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is a predetermined search parameter .    for example , set @xmath148 .",

    "in this paper , we examined the state - space complexity of the error - trellis of an ldpc convolutional code derived from the qc block code specified by a parity - check matrix @xmath1 . since the entries in the corresponding parity - check matrix @xmath0 are all monomials , we can construct a reduced error - trellis using the method of [ 1 ] or that of [ 8 ] .",
    "we noticed that when cyclic shifts are applied to the rows of @xmath1 , the qc code remains unchanged , whereas the corresponding parity - check matrix @xmath2 , which defines another convolutional code , has row / column factors different from those in the original @xmath0 .",
    "that is , the ocl of @xmath163 , where @xmath163 is the matrix obtained by factoring out row / column factors in @xmath2 , varies depending on the row shifts applied to @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the free distance of the resulting convolutional code is still lower - bounded by the minimum distance of the original qc code .",
    "these facts imply that the state - space complexity of the error - trellis associated with @xmath2 can be controlled to some extent with the error - correction capability being preserved and this is our basic idea . by applying our method to the example in [ 10 ] ,",
    "we have shown that the ocl of the parity - check matrix of an ldpc convolutional code can be significantly reduced compared to the average one . the ldpc convolutional codes proposed by tanner et al .",
    "have large constraint lengths .",
    "therefore , it is stated [ 10 ] that the use of trellis - based decoding is not feasible .",
