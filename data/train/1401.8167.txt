    "in 1934 , wigner @xcite pointed out a possible crystallization of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum jellium ( one - component plasma ) , consisting of charged particles immersed in a homogeneous neutralizing background , at low densities .",
    "the possibility of the formation of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal of electrons on the surface of liquid helium and in inversion layers of semiconductors at low temperatures was predicted theoretically in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the corresponding experiments of an electron gas trapped at the surface of liquid helium was realized by grimes and adams @xcite , in the semiconductor structure gaas / gaalas by andrei _",
    "@xcite , and of laser - cooled @xmath4be@xmath5 ions confined in penning traps by mitchell _",
    "_ @xcite . for reviews about classical and quantum coulomb crystals , see e.g. @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , the ground - state energies of a classical 2d electron crystal and the phonon spectra were studied for a variety of bravais lattices in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the conclusion that a simple hexagonal structure ( built up by equilateral triangles ) provides the lowest energy . to understand the thermodynamics and the dynamical properties of electrons at low temperatures , deviations from a perfect crystal have been studied in the seminal work of fisher _ et al .",
    "these investigations involve ( i ) localized low - energy defects ( such as vacancies , interstitials , etc . ) which are expected to govern dynamical properties of migrating electrons , and ( ii ) extended defects with higher energies ( such as dislocations , grain boundaries , etc . ) which are supposed to play an important role in the melting process of the crystal . at the present stage of knowledge ,",
    "grain boundaries are responsible for melting 3d wigner crystals , while the kosterlitz - thouless theory of dislocations and disclinations @xcite describes the melting of 2d electron crystals .",
    "related models involve curved geometries @xcite , large 2d coulomb clusters confined by a harmonic potential @xcite , 2d colloidal crystals with pair interactions of yukawa @xcite or @xmath6 @xcite forms .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study from a classical perspective the ground - state problem of taking off a charge from a bidimensional crystal .",
    "our starting point is a perfect , 2d wigner crystal which we assume to be embedded in the @xmath7-plane .",
    "it is formed by particles ( each with a negative elementary charge of @xmath8 ) , localized at the sites of a hexagonal lattice ( with lattice spacing @xmath9 ) .",
    "the charges of the particles are neutralized by a uniform background of charge density @xmath10 .",
    "then , we take one of the charges ( carrying the index @xmath11 , and coined the `` reference '' or `` tagged '' particle ) away from the crystal and fix it at a distance @xmath0 in the vertical @xmath12-direction . as we consider increasingly large values for @xmath0",
    ", the remaining particles in the wigner crystal will leave their original , regular lattice positions and will intuitively approach the vacancy left behind by the tagged particle .",
    "this spatial deformation is realized in an effort to minimize the total interaction energy of the setup ( i.e. , `` wigner crystal + tagged charge '' ) .",
    "it stands to reason that the removal of charge 0 has a stronger impact on the particle positions of the lattice the closer these particles have been to the tagged charge in the original wigner crystal ( i.e. at @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , one should not forget that due to the long - range nature of the coulomb potential , the interactions between all particles are important .",
    "two limiting cases can be envisioned .",
    "( i ) when @xmath1 , and presumably when @xmath13 , the reference particle has coordination six , see figure [ sketch ] .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , at asymptotically large distances ( i.e. , for @xmath14 ) , the wigner crystal is interacting only weakly with the tagged particle and therefore the perfect hexagonal structure of the lattice should be maintained . under these conditions ,",
    "the total optimal configuration is realized when the projection of the reference particle coincides with the center of any triangle formed by three neighbouring particles of the wigner crystal ( see right panel of figure [ sketch ] ) .",
    "the transformation of the wigner crystal from a six - fold coordination ( valid at least for @xmath1 ) to a three - fold coordination ( valid at least for @xmath15 ) , induced by a change in the distance @xmath0 of the tagged particle , represents the central topic of this contribution .    , its coordination number becomes three . in the remainder",
    ", the dimensionless counterpart of @xmath0 will be denoted @xmath16 . ]    to the best of our knowledge , the proposed problem has not been addressed so far .",
    "it naturally appears when studying the strong - coupling regime of counter - ions close to a uniformly charged wall @xcite .",
    "it also is of relevance within the context of phenomena such as evaporation of particles from a surface at low temperatures or the creation of lattice defects by manipulating individual particles @xcite .",
    "several fundamental questions arise :    * does the six - fold coordination of the tagged charge change to a three - fold coordination ( or even to some other value ) at a _",
    "finite _ distance @xmath3 or already at an infinitesimally small value ? * what is the nature of the transition as the six - fold coordination is lost ?",
    "in particular , is it _ continuous _ , i.e. do the six nearest neighbours of the tagged particle rearrange in a continuous fashion into some non - equivalent subsets of particles , each specified by a different shift away from their original crystal positions ? or is the transition _ discontinuous _ , accompanied by a change in the slope of the energy at the transition distance , @xmath3 ?",
    "* if the three- and six - fold coordinated limiting states lead to metastable configurations at finite @xmath0 , what is the corresponding energy barrier ? does it take a finite value , or does it scale with the number of particles , @xmath17 ?",
    "the last question is relevant in view of practical realization of the `` experiment '' , and also pertinent for computational purposes .",
    "our analysis will show that metastable states can coexist for all distances , separated by an energy barrier that seems high enough so that the system will stay in a local energy minimum also after crossing the transition distance @xmath3 . in that case ,",
    "when increasing @xmath0 , one observes a hysteresis similar to that of ferromagnetic systems . in the ferromagnetism of two macroscopic @xmath18 and @xmath19 magnetized states ,",
    "one needs a relatively large opposite magnetic field to reverse the magnetization of a macroscopic domain . in our problem , the role of the magnetic field is taken over by the distance @xmath0 : if @xmath20 , the local minimum ( a reminiscence of the six - fold coordinated state at @xmath1 ) might become unstable , or might start to transform into a precursor of the state with three - fold coordination .    the metastability feature will lead us to define two branches ( see section [ model ] ) : the `` out''-branch ( extrusion ) where @xmath0 increases , starting from 0 where the coordination is six - fold , and the `` in''-branch ( intrusion ) , starting from large @xmath0 where the coordination number is three , and decreasing @xmath0 down to 0 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that we shall consider a sequence of equilibrium situations only , at vanishing temperature ( i.e. we let the system find the lowest total energy configuration , for every @xmath0 ) . in doing so , we will answer a few of the questions addressed above .",
    "we have used three theoretical tools : energy minimization , monte carlo simulations ( both methods being purely numerical ) , and an analytic approach .",
    "they all bear their own limitations , since simplifying assumptions were made to allow for solutions : in both numerical approaches we have considered a unit cell ( containing a sufficient number of particles ) that contains a finite section of the wigner crystal as well as the tagged charge ; for a fixed position of charge 0 , all particles of the remaining lattice are allowed to freely relax their position [ remaining in the same @xmath21 plane ] .",
    "the entire system is then a periodic replication of this unit cell . in the analytic approach ,",
    "the system is assumed to be of infinite extent in the @xmath7-direction ; however , spatial relaxations were allowed only for the nearest neighbours of the tagged charge , for simplicity .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "the model is specified in detail in section [ model ] , where the two branches are introduced .",
    "we then present in section [ numerical - approach ] the basic features of our two numerical approaches , energy minimization and monte carlo simulations .",
    "both methods rely on ewald summation techniques , to take due account of the long range nature of the interaction potential .",

    "as alluded to above , locally stable configurations may be found for a given @xmath0 , which in turn complicates the search for the ground - state of the system .",
    "these states seem to be remnants of the coordination six structure valid at @xmath1 on the one hand , and of the coordination three structure valid at large @xmath0 on the other hand . to circumvent the ensuing metastability problem , we have defined  and investigated separately  two branches for computing the energies .",
    "( i ) along the `` out''-branch , we take our tagged particle ( extruder ) from its hexagonally coordinated position in the perfect wigner crystal , and place it at a distance @xmath0 , letting then @xmath0 range from @xmath11 to @xmath46 .",

    "figure [ schemecoord1 ] displays typical configurations for the two branches , and defines variables that will be measured subsequently for quantitative analysis .    to obtain meaningful results for large system sizes ,",
    "we subtract from @xmath47 and @xmath48 the ground - state energy of the _ perfect _ wigner crystal , @xmath40 , [ cf . equation ( [ energy0 ] ) ] when the tagged particle is still part of the wigner crystal .",
    "we thereby define @xmath49 our main interest focuses on how @xmath50 and @xmath51 vary as functions of @xmath0 . for a given value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the state with the lower energy is considered as the ground - state , while the other one is metastable .",
    "it will be shown that a transition takes place between the two branches at a distance @xmath52 which is determined by the equality @xmath53 .    before embarking on a detailed study ,",
    "it is useful to work out the limiting values of @xmath50 and @xmath54 , i.e. for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we have @xmath57 by definition . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath58 may differ from zero , if the system , along the `` in''-branch , remains trapped in a metastable state , even at @xmath1 . in that case",
    ", we expect @xmath59 for consistency .",
    "considering next the asymptotic value @xmath60 , we note that the interaction of the tagged particle with the wigner crystal vanishes as @xmath0 tends towards infinity . in this situation ,",
    "the remaining @xmath61 particles form a perfect wigner crystal with a lattice spacing @xmath62 given by @xmath63 the total energy of the @xmath61 charges forming a wigner crystal of spacing @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 thus , @xmath66 \\mathop{\\sim}_{n\\to\\infty } - \\frac{3}{2 } c e^2 \\sqrt{\\sigma } \\",

    "however , the point is that an infinitesimal increase of the lattice spacing ( after having taken off one particle from the system ) , when multiplied by an ( infinite ) @xmath17 , contributes to the energy change by a finite amount .",
    "note that a similar phenomenon would hold for any inverse - power - law potential .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath69 might differ from the expression given in equation ( [ asymp ] ) , provided that the `` out''-branch is frozen in a local minimum for @xmath56 .",
    "we should nevertheless observe that @xmath70 .    finally , instead of the distance @xmath0",
    ", we will use in the following the dimensionless distance @xmath16 defined by @xmath71",
    "the problem , as specified in the introduction , involves an infinite monolayer of charged particles on a neutralising background , with a test particle held fixed at a given vertical distance @xmath0 from the monolayer .",
    "it is as such not amenable to numerical treatment . for the sake of numerical implementation",
    ", we shall consider a finite section of the monolayer , and impose periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath72-plane , a routine practice , thereby replicating the cell that contains the section in question and the tagged charge .",
    "keeping in mind that we are dealing with long range interactions , finite size effects must be carefully studied , in order to guarantee that the observations made are not a consequence of the finiteness of the setup . due to periodic replication",
    ", the system under scrutiny becomes a bilayer , with inter - layer spacing @xmath0 , number density @xmath73 close to @xmath74 on the `` bottom '' layer , and a _ finite _ although small number density of particles on the `` top '' layer , @xmath75 : @xmath76 this means that for large separation @xmath16 , the system behaves as a capacitor with surface charges @xmath77 , and an energy @xmath78 which consequently diverges like @xmath79 , due to the the finite electric field between the two plates .",
    "this feature , which sets in for @xmath80 , however is immaterial here , since the phenomena we shall study take place for @xmath0 on the order of the lattice spacing @xmath9 .",
    "two different numerical approaches were implemented : one is based on a zero temperature energy minimisation technique , the other one on monte carlo ( mc ) simulations at low temperature .      to find the equilibrium configuration for a given dimensionless distance @xmath16",
    ", we have to minimise the energies @xmath81 and @xmath82  cf .",
    "equation ( [ delta_e ] ) . under the assumption of periodicity",
    ", we can calculate these quantities by employing ewald summation techniques @xcite , which guarantee , with suitably chosen numerical parameters , a relative accuracy of @xmath83 or less .",
    "we chose cutoff distances in real and reciprocal space to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , and an ewald summation parameter @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "we require an efficient gradient descent method to minimise the total energy .",
    "for this purpose we have employed the l - bfgs - b algorithm @xcite .",
    "the derivatives of the energy with respect to the free parameters ( i.e. , the positions of the particles ) can be calculated explicitly from the analytical expressions of the ewald sums with high numerical accuracy .",
    "a possible shortcoming of such a gradient descent method is that the system can be trapped in local minima ; this is the reason why the `` out''- and `` in''-processes may lead to different results . in practice",
    ", we have studied the `` out''-branch with a system of @xmath87 charges , and its `` in''-counterpart with @xmath88 ( in the latter case , it is convenient to take @xmath17 as @xmath89 , a square integer plus one , since at large @xmath0 , we are dealing with a perfect undistorted crystal ( with @xmath90 charges in the simulation cell ) , to which the tagged particle should be added .",
    "the reason for choosing ensembles of this size is justified by the fact that for such a number of particles the interactions of a charge with its periodic images have become negligible .",
    "we have verified our results by employing an optimisation tool based on evolutionary algorithms @xcite and have compared the results .",
    "this more general approach does not require following a particular branch .",
    "instead , the algorithm starts from several random configurations .",
    "new configurations are created from one or two existing ones and optimised using the l - bfgs - b method .",
    "this process is repeated many times , combining good traits of previous configurations and exploring new arrangements , until the excess energy no longer improves . in doing so",
    ", we recover as the optimal state one of the configurations obtained following `` in''- or `` out''-branches , depending on which one is more favourable",
    ". therefore , this more sophisticated method does not provide any energetic improvement over the results that were obtained using the gradient - based approach with suitable starting configurations , which furthermore yield an insight on metastability .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations reported here have been carried out in the canonical ensemble with fixed @xmath17 , a constant surface @xmath33 , and a finite temperature @xmath91 .",
    "the standard metropolis algorithm has been used throughout @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were enforced ( like in the energy minimisation route ) , and changes in the shape of the simulation box were allowed .",
    "the long range nature of the coulomb interaction is again taken into account with the ewald summation technique , along similar lines as for previous studies on wigner bilayers @xcite .",
    "the one component plasma coupling constant for a two - dimensional system is defined as @xmath92 .",
    "being interested in ground - state properties , our goal is to know the @xmath93 behaviour of the system . in the mc simulations ,",
    "a particularly high value was thus chosen , @xmath94 , about ten times larger than the melting temperature @xcite .",
    "this guarantees that the wigner monolayer , although investigated in mc at a non vanishing temperature , is nevertheless in a crystalline state , with charges very close to their ground - state positions .",
    "it should be kept in mind though that as @xmath0 increases , the coupling energy between the reference charge and the polarised crystal becomes weaker , and that the effect of a finite temperature consequently becomes more prevalent .",
    "more specifically , there exists an upper distance , diverging for small @xmath91 as @xmath95 , beyond which the field created by the reference charge is insufficient to `` pin '' the charges in the monolayer . in order to gauge finite size effects ( if any ) , two system sizes have been considered : @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "one mc - cycle corresponds to a trial move of the @xmath61 mobile particles and a trial change in the shape of the simulation box , keeping the surface @xmath33 fixed . for ensembles with @xmath96 particles ,",
    "@xmath98 mc - cycles have been performed in order to relax the system from its initial condition ; all ensemble averages , denoted in the following by @xmath99 have been taken during @xmath100 additional mc - cycles . for ensembles with @xmath97 ,",
    "equilibration runs were carried out over @xmath101 mc - cycles and averages were computed over @xmath102 mc - cycles .      in the energy minimisation approach ,",
    "the relative displacements of the particles with respect to their original positions can be easily extracted , once the monolayer has relaxed and adapted to the presence of the reference charge . of particular interest here are those particles that are closest to the tagged charge ( see schematic views in both panels of figure [ schemecoord1 ] ) .",
    "there are therefore no fluctuations in the particle positions , unlike in monte carlo , where an accurate localisation of particles requires a somewhat more elaborate analysis .",
    "particle positions are represented by 3d vectors , @xmath103 with @xmath104 the in plane position ( perpendicular to @xmath12 ) ; for the tagged particle @xmath105 and @xmath106 while for particles in the monolayer , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . to describe on a quantitative level the structural properties of the system , we have evaluated the pair correlation function between the fixed reference particle and the other charges belonging to the monolayer ( @xmath109 ) .",

    "figure [ defectenergy ] therefore conveys our main results , showing @xmath184 and @xmath82 , as defined in equation ( [ delta_e ] ) , calculated via the two numerical approaches as well as with the analytic method .",
    "first of all , the three methods display very consistent results on the `` out''-branch . only for large @xmath16",
    "do they start to depart , with the analytical prediction providing expectedly higher energy configurations .",
    "this clearly stems from the assumption that only the six labeled charges in the left panel of figure [ schemecoord2 ] are mobile . turning to the `` in''-branch , we observe that restricting the mobile charges to now a set of three ( see section [ analytic - approach ] ) , becomes more problematic .",
    "the analytical `` in''-branch energy departs significantly from the results of energy minimisation and mc , the latter two being again consistent ( broken lines ) .",
    "we note that the limiting cases discussed in section [ ssec : inandout ] are obeyed .",
    "the energy graph is indeed compatible with the `` in''-bound ( [ asymp ] ) .",
    "in addition , we can extrapolate from the data that @xmath185 , as a fingerprint of metastability along the `` out''-branch , even at large @xmath16 . on the other hand , at short distances , a related metastable blocking is observed for the `` in''-branch , resulting in values of @xmath58 that are slightly positive .    within a good agreement between the two numerical methods , the `` in''- and `` out''-curves cross at @xmath186 , see also the inset of figure [ defectenergy ] .",
    "thus , below this value , the stable state lies on the `` out''-branch , while for @xmath187 , the `` in''-branch structure is energetically more favourable . what are the configurations of the charges along these two branches ?",
    "in particular , is coordination six retained along the `` out''-protocol , and likewise is coordination three retained all along the `` in''-branch ? to answer these questions , we will focus on the particle displacements . even though the `` out''- and the `` in''-branches are metastable for @xmath187 and for @xmath188 , respectively",
    ", we will discuss some of their properties not only for stable but also for metastable particle configurations , as we have observed some interesting features .",
    "the displacement of the six most central particles ( @xmath189 to @xmath190 ) , as calculated along the `` out''-branch , are accumulated in figure [ outdeformation ] as functions of @xmath16 .",
    "they are computed from the particle positions at @xmath130 , indicated by the peaks of the corresponding @xmath123 . for @xmath191 , @xmath192-values ( @xmath193 )",
    "are all positive and equal : upon increasing @xmath16 , the ring of inner particles contracts uniformly towards the vacancy , while fully maintaining the six - fold rotational symmetry of the particle arrangement ( see left - most schematic inset in figure [ outdeformation ] ) . however , when passing this @xmath16-threshold value , symmetry breaking takes place : for @xmath194 , the particle configuration has now only three - fold rotational symmetry .",
    "the six most central particles split up into two sets of three : ( i ) particles of the first set ( say 1 , 3 , 5 ) , with their @xmath192-values being throughout positive , have shifted towards positions that are closer to the vacancy than the positions of the second set ; ( ii ) the displacements of the particles of the latter set ( say 2 , 4 , 6 ) decrease in this @xmath16-range monotonously ; they even become negative at @xmath195 , indicating that for @xmath196 particles of the second set are more distant from the vacancy than in the ideal wigner crystal . at this point",
    "it should be noted , that the best and the second - best configurations as determined via energy minimisation often differ by minute differences in their energy ( i.e. , by a few tenth or less of a percent ) .",
    "on the other hand , the analytical treatment does not predict this very scenario , even if it _ a priori _ allows for a symmetry breakdown of the type `` 3 + 3 '' ( see figure [ schemecoord2 ] ) .",
    "this points to the subtle effect of charge displacement beyond the first ring of neighbours , which although small , can influence the structure in a non - trivial way .",
    "we emphasise at this point the excellent agreement between data obtained from the energy minimisation approach and results extracted from mc simulations , that extends for distances of the tagged particle up to @xmath197 .",
    "finally , as we pass this @xmath16-value , another transition takes place to a configuration with only two - fold symmetry ( see the right - most particle sketch of figure [ outdeformation ] ) : two sets of particles form with two particles ( say , indices 1 and 4 ) , the other one with four particles ( say , indices 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) . according to the minimisation approach ,",
    "this transition is discontinuous , while there are indications that in mc simulations , this transition is continuous ; due to the large error bars ( see discussion below ) an unambiguous conclusion about the nature of this transition is difficult to reach . for the former set of particles ( where the two charges are located on opposite positions with respect to the vacancy ) , the @xmath137-values are positive .",
    "the charges thus have approached the hole left by the tagged particle .",
    "the other four charges ( forming the second set ) are characterised by small , negative @xmath137-values ( which , with increasing @xmath16 , tend to zero ) , indicating that these particles have moved away from the central position of the vacancy .",
    "at this point it is worthwhile to note that  while the average values for the displacement as computed via mc simulations are in close agreement with the data obtained with the energy minimisation approach ( and with the analytical results for @xmath198 )  the fluctuations of the mc - data are non - negligible .",
    "to be more specific , for @xmath199 , the agreement between the two sets of numerical data is better than 1% and at most 3 to 5 % for higher @xmath16-values ( see data shown in figure [ outdeformation ] ) .",
    "however , the error bars , given by the respective @xmath128-values and displayed in this figure are quite large , and do increase when @xmath16 increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that particles in the layer are pinned by the external potential of the reference charge , which becomes softer as @xmath16 grows .",
    "the resulting fluctuations ensure that the mc algorithm explores thoroughly the phase space `` around '' the equilibrium positions ; it is the excellent accuracy of the harmonic approximation that is able to identify well the equilibrium positions of the particles as compared with the positions obtained via the energy minimisation approach and via the analytic method .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the energy curves shown in figure [ defectenergy ] .     to @xmath190 ( in units of @xmath9 ) of the six nearest neighbours of the tagged particle along the `` out''-branch as defined in the left panel of figure [ schemecoord1 ] as functions of @xmath16 .",

    "error bars indicate the @xmath74-values of the gaussian fit ",
    "equation ( [ corr - fit ] ) .",
    "the three schematic views provide a qualitative impression of the displacement of the six , most central particles.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we now proceed with a more quantitative analysis of the aforementioned splitting of the six most central particles in two subsets of charges .",
    "this fact is visible in the @xmath124-branch shown in figure [ fitpeaksg1 ] , and also appears in the bottom panel of figure [ fitneighg1 ] .",
    "the other two branches of figure [ fitpeaksg1 ] ( displaying data for @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) show a weak , monotonous decrease with increasing @xmath16 , indicating that not only the nearest neighbours are affected by the displacement of the tagged particle , but also second and third nearest neighbours ( even though their displacements are much weaker ) .",
    "finally , the top panel of figure [ fitneighg1 ] provides evidence that the number of particles in each shell assumes an essentially constant and @xmath16-independent value of six ( deviations for @xmath201 can be attributed to the statistical noise in mc simulations ) .",
    "we conclude that the perturbation induced by the tagged charge progresses shell - by - shell throughout the crystal .",

    "top panel : sum over the neighbours located _ within _ the first , the second , and the third shell , as functions of @xmath16 .",
    "results are shown for two different system sizes , lines are drawn as guide to the eye . ]    to complete our discussion on the displacement of the particles , we turn to the `` in''-branch : here the scenario is simpler since three - fold symmetry is maintained along the entire branch , with the @xmath137-values decreasing continuously , to vanish at large @xmath16 . since the analytical prediction is less reliable here , as explained earlier , less effort was devoted to studying that branch .",
    "only nearest neighbour results from mc simulations are shown , since the localisation of charges is less accurate for the next nearest neighbours ( i.e. , @xmath138 data ) .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ energy_out ] that the trend found in mc , em and analytically is consistent , and that the small differences between the two numerical data sets do not alter the good agreement found at the level of the energy , see figure [ defectenergy ] .",
    "the energy minimimization route allows for an accurate determination of the individual displacements @xmath137 and @xmath138 of each of the labeled particles in the right panel of figure [ schemecoord1 ] ; we find that particles carrying labels 1 , 2 , and 3 are displaced ( within numerical accuracy ) by the same displacement @xmath44 , while the other three particles ( with indices 4 , 5 , and 6 ) are shifted by the same @xmath203-value .",
    "thus we can conclude that throughout the entire `` in''-branch three - fold coordination is preserved .",
    ", along the `` in''-branch .",
    "the displacements ( defined in the right panel of figure [ schemecoord1 ] ) are computed from the positions occupied at large @xmath16 .",

    "finally , in an effort to provide a _ quantitative _ impression about the influence of the tagged particle on the displacement of the charges in the monolayer , we have collected in figure [ snapshots ] views of particle arrangements for selected @xmath16-values . in addition , we have concatenated sequences of equilibrium configurations for increasing ( `` out''-branch ) and decreasing ( `` in''-branch ) @xmath16-values into short animations , which are presented in the supplementary material .",

    "this creates a vacancy in the plane , towards which some of the other charges move . for all @xmath0 values",
    ", we have determined the ground - state properties and structure of the system .",
    "starting from the expected ground - states at @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , we followed the particle rearrangements along the corresponding `` out''- and `` in''-branches , evidencing the metastability of the system .",
    "two numerical techniques were used , namely direct energy minimisation and monte carlo simulations at a sufficiently small temperature . a third , independent procedure , of the evolutionary type ,",
    "was also employed to check some of the results .",
    "in addition , an analytic treatment was performed , under the assumption that only those neighbours that are closest to the tagged particle ( in either the @xmath1 or the @xmath2 case ) are allowed to move : thus six along the `` out''-branch , and three along the `` in''-one .",
    "all point charges interact through the usual @xmath211 potential , which requires careful numerical treatment , and use of recently derived results for handling lattice summations with extremely high precision .",
    "since all particles bear the same charge and our interest is focused on ground - state features , the results obtained are independent of the value of the charge .",
    "we proved the existence of a transition distance @xmath212 , @xmath74 being the background density , so that for @xmath213 , the reference charge is six - fold coordinated , while for @xmath214 , the coordination is three . in terms of lattice spacing @xmath9 , the transition distance reads @xmath215 .",
    "the transition between both states is discontinuous , and involves an energy barrier that has not been investigated in this contribution .",
    "the actual evaluation of the height of this barrier would require different tools than the ones used in this paper ; we have therefore postponed this undoubtedly interesting question to a future contribution .",
    "one can assume ( or anticipate ) that this barrier is sufficiently high so that once the system lies on a given branch ( `` in '' or `` out '' ) , it stays trapped in the corresponding energy valley : the `` out''-branch was observed to be metastable for @xmath214 , and conversely , the `` in''-branch is metastable for @xmath213 . while the `` out''-branch state is of coordination six in its range of stability , a symmetry breaking takes place around @xmath216 , beyond which the `` out''-branch is three - fold , and ultimately , two - fold coordinated .",
    "as far as the `` out''-branch is concerned , good agreement between the numerical and analytical results was reported .",
    "the situation complicates for the `` in''-branch .",
    "first of all , the exact treatment assumed _ a priori _ in that case only three mobile neighbours , a number which turned out to be insufficient . allowing for more mobile neighbours ( say six , as for the `` out''-analysis ) , would certainly improve the predictions .",
    "in addition , the `` in''-case is also more elusive within the mc scheme .",
    "the reference state is indeed the large @xmath0 case , where the coupling energy between the fixed reference charge and the monolayer becomes small , and is washed out by the fluctuations induced by temperature .",
    "a more refined study of the `` in''-branch is left for the future .",
    "an interesting question , coupled to that of the energy barrier alluded to above , pertains to the structure of the transition state ( the one at the saddle point between the two states at @xmath3 ) .",
