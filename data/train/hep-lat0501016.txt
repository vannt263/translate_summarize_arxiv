    "<S> we study the massive curci - ferrari model as a starting point for defining brst quantisation for yang - mills theory on the lattice . </S>",

    "<S> brst , gauge - fixing , lattice , gribov copies 11.15.ha , 11.30.ly , 11.30.pb        brst symmetry has proven an invaluable tool in the perturbative quantisation of gauge theories @xcite so that its elevation to the non - perturbative level is clearly desirable . for one , </S>",
    "<S> brst methods are crucial in the formulation of schwinger - dyson equations ( sdes ) in covariant gauges , which seem genuinely non - perturbative , have been subject to study using various truncations at this level@xcite , and whose results are now subject to comparisons with corresponding computations in landau gauge from lattice gauge theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been demonstrated that a standard formulation of brst symmetry invoked for lattice fields rigorously forces the partition function and path integrals of brst invariant operators with a brst invariant measure to vanish identically @xcite . rather than defining the configuration space in terms of some subset with no gribov copies @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> one sums them all with alternating sign of the faddeev - popov determinant ( only for small fields about @xmath0 is this positive and thus the jacobian of a change of variables ) and a complete cancellation takes place giving the nonsensical result @xmath1 for lattice expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to attempting to resolve unity in the faddeev - popov trick via the partition function of a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) whose fields are the @xmath2 group elements in the background of an external gauge or link field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such integrals of brst invariant observables are topological invariants , the euler character for @xmath2 for the partition function , which all vanish giving the zeroes of the neuberger problem . </S>",
    "<S> equivariant gauge - fixing @xcite evades this no - go theorem through a sequential gauge - fixing via coset space decomposition of @xmath2 , as in maximal abelian gauge , so that the submanifolds of @xmath2 implicit in this decomposition have non - zero euler character . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation is however distant from covariant gauge schwinger - dyson equations . </S>",
    "<S> significantly though , there are quartic ghost couplings signalling that the damping term in the action for scalar nakanishi - lautrup auxiliary fields @xmath3 is not brst exact , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this also signals the break down of the neuberger argument .    </S>",
    "<S> quartic ghost couplings also arise in generalisations of the brst and anti - brst symmetry of landau gauge through the so - called curci - ferrari ( cf ) `` gauges '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they also allow for a massive vector field while retaining brst- ( though not gauge-)invariance . </S>",
    "<S> but nilpotency of the ( anti-)brst algebra and thus unitarity are lost to be recovered , along with the original ym theory , in the massless limit . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , this limit gives a theory which is local , covariant , brst invariant , perturbatively renormalisable and close in spirit to landau gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we will elucidate these details in light of the topological approach to gauge - fixing and the neuberger problem in the following , showing how these `` bugs '' possibly become features which may enable a non - perturbative definition of brst .    </S>",

    "<S> commutators and anti - commutators of variables will be separately indicated by @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 .    for the continuum theory </S>",
    "<S> we have the brst and anti - brst algebras @xmath19 where for the lattice eqs.([contbrst ] ) are replaced by @xmath20 with these , the gauge - fixing is symmetric under @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we have then @xmath22 which can be geometrically interpreted as the vanishing of a curvature in the extended space and so both ghosts and anti - ghosts are maurer - cartan one - forms . </S>",
    "<S> we still have some freedom in specifying the variations of the auxiliary field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath23 + \\frac{1}{8 } [ \\bar{c},\\{c , c\\ } ] \\nonumber\\\\ { \\bar s}b & = & m^2 { \\bar c } -\\frac{1}{2 } [ b,{\\bar c } ]   - \\frac{1}{8 } [ c,\\{{\\bar c},\\bar{c}\\ } ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an @xmath24 group with generators @xmath25 specified by @xmath26 and @xmath27 enables us to replace nilpotency by the relations : @xmath28 the gauge - fixing of the yang - mills action can be achieved by the addition of a ( anti-)brst - invariant but not brst - exact action , namely @xmath29 where for the continuum ( respectively lattice ) theory the most general choice for @xmath30 is @xmath31 , \\ w_{\\rm{lat}}=\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{ij } { \\rm{tr } } [ { \\rm{re } } u_{ij }   - \\xi { \\bar c}_i c_i]\\ ] ] the first terms of which one recognises as the continuum ( lattice ) functionals whose stationary points with respect to gauge transformations give the landau gauge .    </S>",
    "<S> the detailed form of the continuum lagrangian after implementing the algebra has been given elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we merely highlight specific terms . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , after integration by parts , @xmath32 . acting with @xmath33 then gives the ghost kinetic term and multiplier field term @xmath34 , which are standard in covariant gauges . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the most complicated structures emerge from @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the damping term for the multiplier field @xmath36 emerges from here , also as in standard covariant gauges . </S>",
    "<S> but one ghost mass term , three - point couplings as well as quartic couplings @xmath37 and permutations thereof appear . </S>",
    "<S> finally the @xmath38 generates both a gluon and ghost mass term .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider now some typical expectation value of a brst invariant observable of the link fields @xmath39 $ ] in the lattice theory corresponding to the massive curci - ferrari gauge : @xmath40\\rangle_{mcf}=   { { \\int du d\\phi e^{-s_{ym}[u]-s_{gf}[u,\\phi]}o[u]}\\over { { \\int du d\\phi e^{-s_{ym}[u]-s_{gf}[u,\\phi ] } } } } \\ ] ] where @xmath41 represents the auxiliary fields , @xmath42 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall now examine the precise relationship between this expectation value and that for lattice ym theory which , in terms of link variables , is well - defined even without gauge - fixing . </S>",
    "<S> we can factor into numerator and denominator the finite ( on the lattice ) integration over the gauge group , @xmath43 and use the standard trick of exploiting the invariance of the measure , observable and ym action under gauge transformations to rewrite the expectation value as @xmath44\\rangle_{mcf } =   { { \\int du e^{-s_{ym}[u]}o[u ] { \\bar z}[u]}\\over { \\int du e^{-s_{ym}[u ] } { \\bar z}[u]}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45= \\int dg d\\phi e^{-s_{gf}[u^g,\\phi ] } \\label{gfqft}\\ ] ] represents the partition function of a field theory in the group @xmath46 and auxiliary variables @xmath41 in the background of the link field @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> _ but this is not a topological quantum field theory _ because the action of this theory is not based on a nilpotent algebra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the consequence of this is that , unlike for tqfts , this partition function depends on the background field , @xmath48}\\over { \\delta u } } \\neq 0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the proof can be sketched as follows . since the measure of @xmath49 $ ] is independent of the link field the variation with respect to @xmath47 acts directly onto the exponential of the action of the theory , @xmath50 $ ] , bringing the action into the measure . </S>",
    "<S> the variation @xmath51 commutes with the operation @xmath52 so that we effectively have @xmath53}.\\ ] ] but the integral of a brst exact quantity with respect to an invariant measure still vanishes , despite the lack of nilpotency , thus @xmath54}\\over { \\delta u } } = m^2 \\int dg d\\phi { { \\delta w}\\over { \\delta u } } e^{-s_{gf}[u^g,\\phi]}\\ ] ] which is not evidently constrained to vanish by any symmetry argument . </S>",
    "<S> thus the partition function depends on the background link . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath49 $ ] can not be factored out and cancelled except in the massless limit , so that ym expectation values can only be defined via the limit @xmath40 \\rangle_{ym } = \\lim_{m\\rightarrow 0 } \\langle o[u]\\rangle_{mcf}.\\ ] ] unfortunately , the usual tricks of tqft can not help us in explicitly evaluating @xmath49 $ ] here : because of explicit dependence on @xmath47 neither a semiclassical limit can be taken ( as in tqft ) nor can the trivial link @xmath55 be chosen ( which for the lattice theory would result in some spin model @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue however that for _ generic _ @xmath56 the partition function @xmath49 $ ] will be non - vanishing : the functional being introduced into the measure _ a la _ faddeev - popov trick is _ orbit - dependent _ and this is precisely what we require in order to lift the degeneracy between gribov regions to avoid the neuberger problem . </S>",
    "<S> we shall illustrate this below for the case of a simple one - link model .    at any rate </S>",
    "<S> , we can give a final formula for the expectation value of a gauge - invariant observable in yang - mills theory in terms of the present construction : @xmath40 \\rangle_{ym } = \\lim_{m\\rightarrow 0 } { { \\int du e^{-s_{ym}[u]}o[u ] { \\bar z}[u]}\\over { \\int du e^{-s_{ym}[u ] } { \\bar z}[u ] } } \\label{finalformula}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 $ ] defined by eq.([gfqft ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can use the language of soft - meson theorems where the pion is a pseudo - goldstone boson for massive quarks and thus describe @xmath49 $ ] as the partition function of a _ </S>",
    "<S> pseudo_-topological quantum field theory ptqft .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now elucidate how the neuberger problem is avoided . </S>",
    "<S> neuberger @xcite considers the integral @xmath57.\\ ] ] the measure @xmath58 is brst invariant as is the action @xmath59 , which includes the yang - mills action . </S>",
    "<S> expectation values in the theory are obtained for @xmath60 , namely @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however @xmath62 must also contain damping terms for the scalar @xmath3 field integrations in @xmath58 since even on the lattice these field directions ( unlike the link field @xmath47 ) are not compact . </S>",
    "<S> the damping term must be itself brst invariant ( upon an appropriate shift of the @xmath3-field  actually in the standard case it is even brst exact , @xmath63 but this is not so relevant here ) . </S>",
    "<S> variation of @xmath64 with respect to @xmath65 brings @xmath66 into the measure , the integrals of which vanish . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath67 and @xmath68 is t - independent . but </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath69 one has an integrand containing no ghost fields which vanishes by the rules of grassmann integration : @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath71 and all expectation values are of the form @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this assumes @xmath72 is well - defined at each step , which is only the case if @xmath62 contains the damping term for @xmath3_. for the massive - curci - ferrari case the structure of the action is different on two grounds : @xmath36 is not brst exact , @xmath73 , but more importantly shifting @xmath3 to @xmath74 gives @xmath75 % + \\frac{1}{8 } \\{b,[{\\bar c } , \\{c , c\\}]\\ }   )   % s { \\rm{tr } } ( b+ \\frac{1}{2 } \\ { \\bar c , c\\})^2 = 2 m^2 { \\rm{tr } } ( c b ) s { \\rm{tr}}\\ b^2 = 2 m^2 { \\rm{tr } } ( c b),\\ ] ] so that the damping term can not be placed in @xmath62 but must be placed in the term multiplied by @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two ways to do this , but keeping as close as possible to neuberger s original argument we can reassign @xmath76 such that under derivation with respect to @xmath65 a brst exact term comes down into the measure . however , either way we can not consider the @xmath69 limit as the functional integral then becomes undamped </S>",
    "<S> this makes the neuberger limit @xmath77 fail , and so the usual proof fails .    </S>",
    "<S> we now explicitly study this proposal in the context of the simple model introduced by testa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an abelian model with only two lattice sites , @xmath78 and thus only one degree of freedom , a link variable @xmath47 which is parametrised through its phase @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 is compact , @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> a gauge transformation corresponds to shifting @xmath80 by a difference @xmath82 which is a fixed quantity for any function @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> there are no plaquettes so the action is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the model essentially only contains topological information . </S>",
    "<S> the brst and anti - brst algebras for this simple gauge field theory can be written @xmath84 note that @xmath3 is now a real field , ghosts are maurer - cartan one - forms and @xmath85 so nilpotency is lost . using that @xmath86 = v^{\\prime } c$ ] and @xmath87 = { \\bar c } v^{\\prime}$ ] </S>",
    "<S> the gauge - fixing action for the massive curci - ferrari model here gives @xmath88 - \\xi { \\bar c } c \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\bar c } [ - v^{\\prime\\prime } + iv^{\\prime } + 2 \\xi b + 2 m^2 \\xi ] c + \\xi b^2 + i b v^{\\prime } - m^2 v\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 $ ] is constrained only by the requirement of periodicity under @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> now this action appears gaussian in all fields because quartic terms @xmath91 all vanish since there is only one species of grassmann field </S>",
    "<S> . integration out of either ghosts or scalar field @xmath3 will upset this . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we can shift @xmath3 via @xmath92 and avoid this . </S>",
    "<S> the action then becomes @xmath93 c + i b v ' + \\xi b^2 - m^2 v\\ ] ] and integration out of @xmath94 will give the gaussian @xmath95)^2)/\\sqrt{\\xi}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is dependent on the gauge parameter @xmath96 for the same reasons as @xmath97 is @xmath47-dependent , but we will consider the case closest to the landau gauge , @xmath98 for which we obtain then the delta function @xmath99 $ ] in the measure . integrating out ghost fields gives for the partition function of the original theory : @xmath100 ) \\delta[v'[a ] ] e^{m^2 v[a]}\\ ] ] which should be compared with the partition function for the unfixed theory : @xmath101 .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that only stationary points of @xmath89 $ ] contribute . </S>",
    "<S> they are weighted by the second derivative which would otherwise correspond to the faddeev - popov determinant ; both signs of @xmath102 can appear . </S>",
    "<S> we crucially see the additional orbit - dependent weighting exponential in the mass consistent with our observations above . </S>",
    "<S> if there are many such stationary points - gribov copies - all of them will be summed over . </S>",
    "<S> but since @xmath89 $ ] is not a gauge - invariant functional of @xmath80 , they will generally come with different weight unless they represent degenerate stationary points of @xmath89 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath103 we recover the neuberger pathology : critical points cancel according to the sign of the second derivative . </S>",
    "<S> the weight factor @xmath104}$ ] breaks this degeneracy so that the partition function will not vanish and the @xmath1 problem disappears .    </S>",
    "<S> let us see this more explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity we work in units of lattice spacing now @xmath105 and choose @xmath89=\\frac{1}{2 } \\sin^2 a $ ] so that @xmath106=\\frac{1}{2 } \\sin 2a$ ] and @xmath107=\\cos 2a$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the `` gauge - fixed '' configurations are thus @xmath108 for which @xmath102 has values @xmath109 respectively while the original @xmath110 has values @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function is trivially evaluated to be @xmath112 note that the constraint that observables @xmath113 be brst invariant in this case means that @xmath114/da=0 $ ] , thus brst invariant observables are just constants , @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> all integrals of @xmath113 are just multiples of the partition function , @xmath116 . thus the expectation value @xmath117 \\rangle = c$ ] in the unfixed theory . </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath103 before taking the ratio reintroduces the pathological @xmath1 result for the expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , keeping @xmath118 small but finite while taking the ratio for the expectation value allows @xmath119 factors to safely cancel in numerator and denominator , giving the correct result for the expectation value , namely the constant @xmath120 .    </S>",
    "<S> whether such an elegant cancellation in expectation values of observables can take place in general , or subtleties of the @xmath121 limit need to be taken into consideration is an open question . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the vanishing of the partition function at @xmath103 can also be understood as the vanishing of the witten index of the underlying tqft with its supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves open the possibility of spontaneous breaking of brst symmetry which would jeopardise the brst cohomology construction of a physical state space . </S>",
    "<S> this aside , there is the question whether renormalisation effects can hinder the program . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the other limits which must follow a lattice calculation : the continuum @xmath122 and thermodynamic @xmath123 limits . </S>",
    "<S> note that for a finite lattice , the lattice gauge group is a simple product of @xmath2 gauge groups per lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> thus the original neuberger zero corresponds to @xmath124 which goes over to a single zero in the @xmath125 limit , related to the remaining global gauge symmetry of the torus at finite volume @xcite . in order to avoid the neuberger problem reappearing in our proposal </S>",
    "<S> it is essential that the curci - ferrari mass remain non - zero for finite @xmath126 but vanishing @xmath127 , particularly in light of renormalisation of the mass . for sufficiently large lattice volume </S>",
    "<S> , there will be no @xmath126 dependence in the appropriate ( and only uv sensitive ) renormalisation constants for @xmath118 ; for example @xcite have computed these in continuum perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus renormalisation will not introduce @xmath126-dependence into @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that it is safe to take @xmath128 either as fast as @xmath129 or independently . </S>",
    "<S> but we stress that these considerations are only heuristic .    </S>",
    "<S> we reiterate that unlike approaches seeking to isolate the gribov or fundamental modular region in the space of gauge fields , this approach takes all gribov regions into account . </S>",
    "<S> there is the proposal that in the _ infinite volume limit _ </S>",
    "<S> configurations on the common boundary of gribov and fundamental modular regions will dominate the ensemble averages of gauge invariant observables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however such `` dominant '' fields will always be some subset of those configurations contributing at finite @xmath130 thus representing no contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> this is also explicitly evident in the simple model .    </S>",
    "<S> open work includes careful examination of the @xmath128 limit for the full theory . </S>",
    "<S> we mention here that the violation of nilpotency of the brst algebra results in negative norm states appearing in the physical hilbert space @xcite defined according to the kugo - ojima criterion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is one way of manifesting the loss of unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> these states do not belong to kugo - ojima quartets . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> one sees explicitly that in the massless limit they become zero norm ( `` daughter '' ) states . </S>",
    "<S> thus from the point of view of the hilbert space , the massless limit is smooth , as it is also for perturbative green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> however , whether the same can be said for non - perturbative green s functions is an open challenging question . </S>",
    "<S> there also remain technical challenges to implementing quartic ghost couplings in the lattice framework . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of additional auxiliary bosonic fields , as in nambu  jona - lasinio models , may be a way forward in this problem .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the massive curci - ferrari model overcomes the neuberger problem for elevating brst symmetry to the non - perturbative level on a finite lattice . beyond this first step , the verification that the massless , continuum , and thermodynamic limit of this procedure is the physically relevant theory faces a number of difficult challenges still . </S>"
