    "some of the cleanest observables in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions which provide sensitive information about the initial state conditions of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite are the spectra of photons and dileptons .",
    "the fact that photons and leptons do not couple via strong interactions to the quarks and gluons of the qgp implies that they escape away from the medium after weakly interacting with the bulk of the plasma , carrying local information about it @xcite .",
    "these probes can thus be used to further constrain estimates for qgp transport coefficients , which explains , for instance , the recent interest on their measurements at rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) @xcite and lhc ( large hadron collider ) @xcite .",
    "one of the contributions to the total yield of these probes is from the thermal production of soft photons and dileptons in the qgp , mostly relevant at low transverse momentum @xmath3 @xcite . at the highest energies currently reached in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 per nucleon , respectively , the baryon chemical potential of the qgp is considerably smaller than its temperature ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , in order to probe the phase diagram of qcd in the @xmath7-plane and search for the critical end point of a putative line of first order chiral phase transition at nonzero values of @xmath2 @xcite , rhic is performing a beam energy scan ( bes ) which goes down to energies between @xmath8 and @xmath9 per nucleon , prompting the need of computing the photon and dilepton production at finite temperature and baryon density .",
    "since the qgp produced at rhic and lhc is expected to be strongly coupled around the qcd crossover transition @xcite , non - perturbative methods are required in order to investigate the production of these electromagnetic probes in the plasma for temperatures in the range @xmath10 .",
    "the use of lattice gauge theory methods to compute the needed production rates is also challenging , since one has to face the double challenge of dealing with the sign problem of the fermion determinant that arises at finite chemical potential and also the computation of real time correlation functions .",
    "a useful non - perturbative tool to explore the strong coupling properties of non - abelian gauge theories is the gauge / gravity duality @xcite , which may be naturally adapted in order to compute real time observables @xcite . since the thermal spectra of photons and dileptons requires the computation of the retarded propagator of the electric current , the gauge / gravity duality presents itself as a useful approach to study such phenomena .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to present a holographic calculation of the thermal spectra of soft photons and dileptons in a strongly coupled non - conformal qgp , at both zero and nonzero @xmath2 .",
    "this shall be done by using a bottom - up einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) holographic model @xcite which provides a good quantitative description of the thermodynamics of @xmath0-flavor lattice qcd around the crossover transition for baryon chemical potentials up to 400 mev ( which is the maximum value of @xmath2 reached in the current bes at rhic ) .",
    "this model lies within the class of bottom - up phenomenological emd actions at finite chemical potential originally proposed in @xcite , which in turn generalize the eintein - dilaton models at zero chemical potential proposed in @xcite .",
    "the thermal spectra we are going to compute here can then be used as inputs in calculations of the total photon and dilepton spectra , such as the ones pursued in ref.s @xcite .",
    "we shall also examine electric charge transport phenomena in the qgp at zero and nonzero @xmath2 , extending the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath7-plane .    in qcd ,",
    "the thermal production rates have been computed at leading order in perturbation theory in ref.s @xcite , and in next - to - leading order in ref . @xcite .",
    "more recently , these thermal spectra have been also calculated in the context of the semi - qgp model @xcite .",
    "calculations of the thermal photon and dilepton spectra in @xmath11 super - yang mills ( sym ) were carried out in @xcite , both at weak coupling by means of perturbation theory , and at strong coupling by means of holography ( see also @xcite for computations of the relevant spectral functions at strong coupling from holography ) .",
    "photon production rates in @xmath11 sym including leading order corrections in the t hooft coupling @xmath12 were considered in ref.s @xcite ( in the last one , leading order corrections in the number of colors @xmath13 were also calculated specifically for the electric conductivity ) .",
    "extensions of these results to anisotropic deformations of @xmath11 sym were also considered in the literature , including cases where the anisotropy is due to the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite , scenarios where the anisotropy is driven by a non - trivial bulk axion field @xcite , and also holographic setups comprising both effects @xcite .",
    "the thermal photon production rate for a non - conformal qgp at zero baryon chemical potential in a similar holographic setup to the one we are going to consider here was recently obtained in @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the qualitative similarities and the quantitative differences we found between our results and the results obtained in @xcite for the thermal photon spectrum at @xmath14 .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we briefly review the main features of the phenomenological emd model @xcite which will be used throughout this work . in section",
    "[ sec : transport ] we setup the flow equations used for computing the retarded propagator of the electric current ( needed in the calculation of the thermal spectra ) and apply these flow equations to obtain different electric charge transport coefficients , namely the dc and ac electric conductivities and the electric charge diffusion constant as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also calculate the electric charge susceptibility as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in section",
    "[ sec : spectra ] we compute the thermal photon and dilepton spectra at zero and nonzero baryon chemical potential .",
    "we finish in section [ sec : conclusion ] by presenting a discussion of the main results of the present work , and in particular how our holographic calculations constraint the thermal photon and dilepton production rates in a strongly coupled qgp to be at least one order of magnitude below perturbative estimates .",

    "in this section we are going to sketch the main features of the holographic model @xcite used in the present work . for a detailed account on the construction of this model , its thermodynamic properties and many transport observables associated to the energy loss of light and heavy quarks traversing a hot and baryon rich medium , we refer the reader to consult @xcite ; see also @xcite for results concerning many transport coefficients associated to the diffusion of baryon charge . here",
    ", we shall only review the essential results in order to keep this work self - contained and also to introduce the scalings needed to compute the physical observables in the so - called numerical coordinates , as we shall discuss in section [ sec : scaling ] .",

    "the newton s constant @xmath25 and the dilaton potential @xmath31 shall be dynamically fixed by demanding that the holographic equation of state at @xmath14 matches the corresponding lattice results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0-flavor qcd with physical quark masses , while the maxwell - dilaton baryon coupling @xmath33 will be dynamically fixed by matching the lattice results for the baryon susceptibility at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "note the action also comprises two boundary terms , where @xmath34 is the gibbons - hawking - york action @xcite needed to establish a well - posed variational problem with dirichlet boundary condition for the metric field , and @xmath35 is the counterterm action constructed by means of the holographic renormalization procedure @xcite , which is required to cancel the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences of the on - shell action .",
    "these two boundary actions only contribute to the real part of green s functions , but since in the calculations to be carried out here we shall be only concerned with the imaginary part of green s functions , which are free of divergences , these two boundary actions will not be needed , therefore , we drop them out .    as detailed discussed in ref.s @xcite , the emd model considered here lies within a class of bottom - up models regarded as effective holographic duals _ mimicking _ in a quantitative way at least part of the @xmath0-flavor qcd properties as manifest in the behavior of some physical observables .",
    "in fact , even though our simple emd construction does not explicitly introduce fundamental flavors at the dual boundary quantum field theory , adequate choices for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( to be reviewed in section [ sec : thermo ] ) are able to _ emulate _ in a quantitative way many of the properties of the @xmath0-flavor qgp around the crossover transition as simulated on the lattice . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a highly non - trivial achievement was the quantitative agreement between the holographic equation of state and the corresponding lattice data @xcite around the crossover transition for baryon chemical potentials up to 400 mev .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , very remarkably , this same model was also shown to quantitatively describe the splitting between the second and fourth order baryon susceptibilities in the deconfined phase , in agreement with a very recent lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "since first principle qcd results for real time observables at finite baryon chemical potential near the crossover transition may be out of the reach of lattice calculations for quite a long time , these results constitute a very good motivation to investigate non - equilibrium phenomena using the present bottom - up holographic model .",
    "we take the following ansatze for the emd fields @xmath36 + \\frac{d\\tilde{r}^2}{\\tilde{h}(\\tilde{r})},\\,\\,\\,\\tilde{\\phi}=\\tilde{\\phi}(\\tilde{r}),\\,\\,\\ , \\tilde{a}=\\tilde{a}_m d\\tilde{x}^m=\\tilde{\\phi}(\\tilde{r})d\\tilde{t } , \\label{eq : metricansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the radial holographic coordinate and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are functions of @xmath37 only .",
    "the function @xmath39 is the blackening factor : in order to have a black brane in the ir portion of the bulk geometry , we impose that the blackening function has a simple zero at @xmath42 , which is the radial location of the spatially extended black brane horizon .",
    "this ansatz preserves the @xmath43 rotational symmetry but breaks lorentz invariance whenever @xmath44 , being consistent with a finite temperature formalism .",
    "we have consistently set to zero every component of @xmath45 , except for @xmath46 , which is taken to be dual to the baryon chemical potential @xmath2 at the boundary gauge theory . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the boundary is at @xmath47 and , near the boundary , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 have the following uv asymptotic behavior @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the number of dimensions of the boundary gauge theory and @xmath55 is the scaling dimension of a relevant operator dual to @xmath50 .",
    "also , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constants .",
    "we remark that the metric is asymptotically @xmath58 and the gauge theory has , therefore , a strongly coupled uv fixed point .    in eq .",
    ", we followed the same notation of ref.s @xcite , where the tildes are employed to express the emd fields in the so - called _ standard coordinates _",
    ", where the blackening function goes to unity at the boundary . in these coordinates , one may use standard holographic expressions to obtain the physical observables of the theory .",
    "for instance , the entropy density follows from the bekenstein - hawking s formula @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 , while the temperature @xmath61 is given by the hawking s temperature of the black brane horizon @xmath62 also , according to the holographic dictionary , the baryon chemical potential @xmath63 and the baryon charge density @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 in eq.s to , the hat on the thermodynamic observables is used to indicate that they are being measured in powers of the inverse of the ads radius @xmath66 , which we have set to unity . in sections [ sec : scaling ] and [ sec : thermo ] , we are going to discuss how one may express these observables in natural units , which shall then be denoted without the hat .",
    "as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to numerically solve the emd equations of motion , one needs first to take a near - horizon taylor expansion for the unknown functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , determine the on - shell taylor coefficients of these expansions and then integrate the equations of motion from the horizon up to the boundary . taking a second order taylor expansion , there are 12 taylor coefficients to be determined in order to initialize the numerical integrations .",
    "two of these coefficients are the initial conditions corresponding to the horizon values of the dilaton field and the first derivative of the maxwell field .",
    "numerical geometries obtained with different choices for these two initial conditions translate into different thermodynamic states @xmath67 at the boundary gauge field theory . in order to perform the numerical integrations",
    ", we must also specify numerical values for the 10 remaining taylor coefficients in the second order near - horizon expansions .",
    "one of them , corresponding to the horizon value of the blackening function , vanishes by definition at the horizon . furthermore ,",
    "since @xmath68 has infinite norm at the horizon , the horizon value of the maxwell field must be set to zero by consistency .",
    "we may completely fix the gauge freedom present in the ansatz by conveniently rescaling the bulk coordinates such as to place the horizon location at @xmath69 and also taking @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where the new coordinates obtained after these rescalings are the so - called _ numerical coordinates _ , which we denote without the tildes .",
    "the 6 remaining taylor coefficients in the second order near - horizon expansions are then determined on - shell as functions of the initial conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in the numerical coordinates , the form of the ansatz for the emd fields reads as follows @xmath74+\\frac{dr^2}{h(r)},\\,\\,\\,\\phi=\\phi(r),\\,\\,\\,a = a_m dx^m=\\phi(r)dt , \\label{eq : metricansatz2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the bulk fields satisfying the following uv asymptotic behavior near the boundary @xcite @xmath75      the equations of motion following from the emd action are solved in the numerical coordinates with the ansatz , but the physical observables are computed in the standard coordinates discussed in section [ sec : standard ] .",
    "thus , one needs to write down the dictionary relating these two coordinate systems .",
    "this is accomplished by comparing the uv asymptotic behaviors and with the requirement that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , from which one obtains the following scaling relations @xmath79    by applying the scaling relations into eq.s to , one may write down expressions for the thermodynamic variables @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath80 , and @xmath64 in the numerical coordinates @xmath81    as discussed in ref.s @xcite , one may convert to natural units the expression for any physical observable @xmath82 with mass dimension @xmath83 measured in units of the @xmath83-th inverse power of the ads radius by employing a scaling factor @xmath84 with mass dimension 1 measured in mev ( for instance ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath85 the expression for the physical observable @xmath86 measured in units of mev@xmath87 . in the next section",
    ", we shall present a procedure to fix the dimensionful scaling factor @xmath84 .",
    "we remark that by using a single scaling factor @xmath84 we do not augment the number of free parameters of the holographic model , since we are basically exchanging the freedom of choosing the ads radius by the freedom of choosing @xmath84 , and also , this prescription respects the fact that any dimensionless ratio must correspond to a pure number independent of the units employed .    in short , the procedure used to compute a physical observable @xmath86 in the present holographic model comprises the following general steps : ( a ) one first derives a holographic expression for @xmath82 in the standard coordinates , ( b ) then one applies the scaling relations to rewrite @xmath82 in the numerical coordinates , which are the coordinates in terms of which the numerical solutions of the emd equations of motion are obtained , ( c ) and , finally , one obtains @xmath86 from @xmath82 by using the scaling factor @xmath84 as discussed above .      as detailed discussed in ref .",

    "it turns out that this criterion may be satisfied by imposing that in the ultraviolet the emd result for @xmath162 tends to the corresponding @xmath147 sym result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath163 where we used the `` effective phenomenological holographic value of @xmath155 '' discussed in the last section .",
    "we must remark , however , that @xmath147 sym theory and @xmath0-flavor qcd are very different theories and that our actual guide to fix the overall normalization of @xmath113 is the lattice data from ref .",
    "@xcite , instead of eq . .",
    "in fact , we could have as well just slightly modified the overall normalization of @xmath113 by performing some small shift on the height of the emd curve for @xmath162 as long as it stayed in between the lowest and the highest points of ref . @xcite .",
    "such a small shift would imply the very same small shift in the height of the electric diffusion constant and the thermal photon and dilepton production rates , but none of our conclusions in the present work would be modified .",
    "the ac electric conductivity @xmath164 is obtained by numerically solving either of the flow equations or at zero spatial momentum ( both flow equations coincide at @xmath165 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaac ] , we show the emd holographic results for the real part of @xmath166 as a function of frequency , temperature , and baryon chemical potential .",
    "one sees that increasing the temperature and/or the baryon chemical potential dampens the oscillations observed in the ac conductivity as a function of frequency .",
    "it is possible to show from the flow equations that for any charged or uncharged black brane the nernst - einstein s relation for the diffusion constant @xmath167 holds @xcite @xmath168 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt ] ( a ) , we show the emd holographic prediction for the normalized diffusion constant @xmath169 at @xmath14 compared to recent lattice data from ref .",
    "@xcite and also the @xmath147 sym result @xmath170 originally obtained in ref .",
    "one observes that the emd model quantitatively captures the decrease in @xmath169 from lower temperatures up to the crossover region as seen in lattice simulations , although it misses the lattice behavior for higher temperatures .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt ] ( b ) the emd predictions for @xmath169 at finite values of the baryon chemical potential , from which one sees a suppression of electric diffusion transport with increasing @xmath2 . the same conclusion of suppression of diffusive transport at nonzero baryon chemical potential was shown to hold also for the diffusion of baryon charge in ref .",
    "therefore , from the present phenomenological emd holographic model one extracts the general prediction of an overall suppression of diffusive transport as one moves toward increasing values of the baryon density .",
    "we now proceed to the main focus of the present work : the evaluation of thermal photon and dilepton production rates in a strongly coupled qgp at both zero and nonzero baryon chemical potential . to accomplish this goal , we need first to obtain an explicit expression for the trace of the spectral function in terms of the boundary values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 defined in eq . .",

    "it is also instructive to compare our results for the normalized thermal photon production rate at different fixed values of @xmath1 and @xmath14 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalphoton ] ( a ) with the corresponding results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig . 3 of that work ) .",
    "one observes that both predictions agree qualitatively , although the results found in ref .",
    "@xcite are one order of magnitude above our results .",
    "such a quantitative discrepancy is entirely due to the different overall normalizations chosen for the maxwell - dilaton electric coupling function @xmath113 in these two works . while in the present work we choose to fix the overall normalization of @xmath113 by matching the uv asymptotic behavior at large @xmath1 for the ratio @xmath161 with the corresponding @xmath11 sym result ( as discussed before ) , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was used instead a different normalization , where the uv asymptotic behavior of the normalized thermal photon production rate itself was matched with the corresponding @xmath11 sym result obtained in ref .",
    "the normalization we have chosen in the present work gives a reasonable agreement with the latest lattice data @xcite for the dc electric conductivity and the electric diffusion constant around the crossover transition , as shown in sections [ sec : dcandac ] and [ sec : diffusion ] , respectively . by adopting the normalization used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the holographic results obtained for the electric charge transport sector are one order of magnitude above the lattice data of ref .",
    "however , one must keep in mind the fact that , as displayed in fig .",
    "@xcite , there is currently no consensus in the literature regarding the order of magnitude of @xmath161 in qcd , since it may drastically vary depending on different models and calculations and there are discrepancies even among different lattice collaborations . therefore , although the qualitative behaviors of the thermal photon production rate at @xmath14 obtained here and in ref .",
    "@xcite are exactly the same , the order of magnitude of this physical observable remains as an open question which deserves further investigation .",
    "we remark , however , that if one takes as a guide the latest lattice data @xcite for @xmath161 , our holographic results constraint the order of magnitude of the thermal photon production rate to be as low as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalphoton ] .",
    "this is roughly one order of magnitude below the perturbative qcd result obtained at @xmath188 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it would lie two orders of magnitude below estimates obtained by employing the values of @xmath161 derived by using the boltzmann approach to multi - parton scatterings ( bamps ) @xcite and parton hadron string dynamics ( phsd ) @xcite .",
    "the suppression in the magnitude of the thermal photon spectra obtained here when compared to perturbative calculations is consistent with what seems to be a general trend regarding the behavior of non - equilibrium observables in strongly coupled systems , like the qgp around the crossover transition .",
    "for instance , the ratio of the shear viscosity over the entropy density obtained by fitting heavy ion experimental data for anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath189 using hydrodynamics gives @xmath190 @xcite , which is of the same order of magnitude of the small value @xmath191 found in a broad class of holographic duals @xcite which includes our model and at least one order of magnitude below perturbative qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "another example is the suppression of roughly one order of magnitude in the baryon conductivity found in ref .",
    "@xcite when compared to the kinetic theory calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the thermal dilepton production rate is given by @xcite @xmath192 where the trace of the spectral function is evaluated at time - like momentum @xmath193 , with @xmath194 being the invariant dilepton mass and @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 are the lepton mass and charge , respectively . by following @xcite , we define the following normalized thermal dilepton production rate @xmath198 which is already written in the numerical coordinates . we have also defined @xmath199 where in the last step we made use of eq.s and .",
    "note also that for the thermal dilepton production , due to the time - like momentum condition @xmath200 , both the longitudinal and transverse conductivities contribute to the trace of the spectral function in eq . .    in fig",
    "[ fig : thermaldilepton ] , we show the emd holographic predictions for the normalized thermal dilepton production rate as a function of the dilepton invariant mass @xmath194 for several choices of the temperature @xmath1 and momentum @xmath201 , at both zero and nonzero baryon chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "we note that , as also observed for the thermal photon spectrum , the peak of the thermal dilepton spectrum is enhanced as one increases the temperature .",
    "varying @xmath2 has essentially no effect on the thermal dilepton production for @xmath202 ; however , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermaldilepton2 ] , increasing @xmath2 enhances the dilepton production rate for @xmath203 . from fig.s",
    "[ fig : thermaldilepton ] and [ fig : thermaldilepton2 ] , one also notes that increasing the momentum @xmath201 dampens the thermal dilepton production rate .",
    "in the present work , we made use of a bottom - up phenomenological einstein - maxwell - dilaton holographic model which is in good quantitative agreement with recent lattice data for the thermodynamics of @xmath0-flavor qcd for values of the baryon chemical potential @xmath2 up to 400 mev , corresponding to the maximum value of @xmath2 reached in the current beam energy scan at rhic , and calculate many electric charge transport observables and the thermal spectra of photons and dileptons in a hot and baryon rich strongly coupled qgp .",
    "first , we obtained holographic predictions for the temperature @xmath1 and baryon chemical potential @xmath2 dependence of the electric charge susceptibility , which was found to increase with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "next , we calculated the dc and ac electric conductivities and also the electric charge diffusion constant as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . around the crossover transition",
    ", we found reasonable agreement between our results for the dc electric conductivity and the electric charge diffusion at @xmath14 and the latest lattice data available @xcite for these physical observables .",
    "we also found that an increase in @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 causes a damping in the oscillations observed in the ac electric conductivity as a function of frequency .",
    "moreover , we obtained that the diffusion of electric charge is suppressed in a baryon rich qgp as one move toward increasing values of the baryon density .",
    "the main results of the present work concern the holographic calculation of the thermal photon and dilepton production rates at both zero and nonzero @xmath2 . we found that increasing @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 enhances the peak present in both spectra , albeit they are less sensitive to variations in @xmath2 than to variations in @xmath1 . in particular , for values of the invariant dilepton mass @xmath202 the dilepton spectrum is insensitive to variations in @xmath2 , although for @xmath203 the thermal dilepton production rate increases with increasing values of the baryon chemical potential .",
    "we also observe a suppression in the thermal production of dileptons as one increases their momentum .",
    "finally , the fact that our model results for the electric conductivity and the electric diffusion constant at @xmath14 are in reasonable agreement with the latest lattice data @xcite for these observables around the crossover transition , gives a constraint on the order of magnitude of the thermal photon and dilepton spectra in a strongly coupled qgp , which according to the present holographic results is typically one order of magnitude lower than perturbative estimates available in the literature .",

    "<S> we obtain the thermal photon and dilepton production rates in a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at both zero and nonzero baryon chemical potential using a bottom - up einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) holographic model that is in good quantitative agreement with the thermodynamics of @xmath0-flavor lattice qcd around the crossover transition for baryon chemical potentials up to 400 mev , which may be reached in the beam energy scan ( bes ) at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> we find that increasing the temperature @xmath1 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath2 enhances the peak present in both spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the electric charge susceptibility , the dc and ac electric conductivities and the electric charge diffusion as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that electric diffusive transport is suppressed as one increases @xmath2 . at zero baryon density , </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results for the dc electric conductivity and the electric charge diffusion with the latest lattice data available for these observables and find reasonable agreement around the crossover transition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our holographic results may be used to constraint the magnitude of the thermal photon and dilepton production rates in a strongly coupled qgp , which we found to be at least one order of magnitude below perturbative estimates . </S>"
