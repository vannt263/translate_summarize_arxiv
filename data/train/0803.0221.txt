    "the investigation of properties of hadrons containing heavy quarks is of great interest in understanding the dynamics of qcd at the hadronic scale .",
    "there is renewed interest both experimentally and theoretically in the static properties of heavy flavour baryons such as mass and magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "many of the narrow hadron resonances observed recently , brought up surprises in qcd spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "recent years , experimental facilities at belle , babar , delphi , cleo , cdf etc have been successful in discovering heavy baryon states along with other heavy flavour mesonic states @xcite and many new states are expected in near future .",
    "baryons are not only the interesting systems to study the quark dynamics and their properties but are also interesting from the point of view of simple systems to study three body problems .",
    "all these reasons make the study of heavy flavour spectroscopy extremely important and interesting . here",
    ", we employ the hyper central approach to study the three - body problem , particularly the baryons constituting one or two charm quarks . in the present study ,",
    "the magnetic moments of heavy flavour baryons are computed based on nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "quark model description of baryons is a simple three body system of interest .",
    "the jacobi co - ordinates to describe baryon as a bound state of three constituent quarks are given by @xcite @xmath4 further , defining the hyper spherical coordinates which are given by the angles @xmath5 @xmath6 together with the hyper radius , @xmath7 and hyper angle @xmath8 respectively as , @xmath9 , the model hamiltonian for baryons can be written as @xmath10 [ ] here the potential @xmath11 is not purely a two body interaction but it contains three - body effects also .",
    "the reduced mass @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are masses of the three constituent quarks . for the present study",
    ", we consider the hyper central potential @xmath11 as @xcite @xmath18 [ ] in this hyperspherical representation of the potential we consider @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 while @xmath23 for charmed baryons and other model parameters are given in@xcite . the trial wave function",
    "is taken @xciteas the hyper coulomb radial wave function .",
    "we study the baryons having different choice of the light flavour(q)combinations for qqc and ccq systems . the computed spin average mass with respect to the potential index , @xmath0 are shown in fig [ fig : massvspot ] . the computed masses of the spin @xmath24 and @xmath25 , single charm and double charm baryons are given in tables [ tab:01 ] and [ tab:02 ] respectively .     for single charm baryons [ a ] and double charm baryons [ b].__,title=\"fig : \" ]   for single charm baryons [ a ] and double charm baryons [ b].__,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ tab:01 ]    ._single charm baryon masses(masses are in mev ) _ [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     nrqm@xcite , al1@xcite",
    "we have employed the hyper central model with hyperspherical potential of the coulomb plus power potential to study the masses and magnetic moments of baryons containing one or two charm flavour quarks .",
    "it is important to see that the baryon mass do not change appreciably for the potential power index @xmath26 ( see fig [ fig : massvspot ] ) .",
    "the model parameters are fixed for this saturated value to the experimental spin average mass of the @xmath27(udc ) system @xcite and the spin hyperfine parameter is fixed to yield their mass difference of 64 mev @xcite .",
    "all other baryonic masses are predicted without changing any of these parameters .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results are in fair agreement with existing experimental as well as other theoretical model predictions .",
    "the result of single charm baryons are in accordance with the lattice results as well as with other model predictions .",
    "the mass variations of the single charm baryons with respect to @xmath0 from 0.5 to 2.0 are found to be around 100 @xmath28 only .",
    "+ our predictions on the doubly charm baryons are compared with other theoretical model predictions in table [ tab:02 ] . since there are larger disagreement among the different model predictions , only the future experiments on these doubly charm baryons would be able to test the validity of the theoretical model predictions .",
    "however , the hyperfine splitting of 76.6 @xmath28 for @xmath29 obtained from lattice predictions@xcite is very close to our calculations of 73 @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to note that the predictions of the magnetic moment of all the heavy hadrons studied here are with no free parameters .",
    "our results for the magnetic moment of single charm baryons with spin @xmath24 are in accordance with the predictions of the full treatment of relativistic quark model as well as with the nonrelativistic approximation reported in @xcite . in the case of doubly charm baryons , our predictions for both @xmath30 and @xmath25 baryons are found to be in good accordance with the recent predictions based on a potential model , al1 @xcite and nrqm @xcite results [ see table [ tab:04 ] ] . + we conclude that the three body interaction assumed in our model plays a significant role in the description of heavy flavour baryonic properties in particular their masses and magnetic moments . the behavior of the masses against the potential index @xmath0 as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : massvspot ] indicates saturation of the basic quark - quark interactions within the heavy baryons as the potential index @xmath31 .",
    "we hope that , the predicted many of the baryonic ground state will be observed in the future high luminosity heavy flavour experiments .",
