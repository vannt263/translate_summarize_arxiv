    "( the proof of this theorem using real analysis alone is long and difficult . )",

    "this paper describes and summarizes our ongoing research program to extend conventional classical mechanics to complex classical mechanics . in our exploration of the nature of complex classical mechanics",
    "we have examined a large class of analytic potentials and have discovered some remarkable phenomena , namely , that these systems can exhibit behavior that one would normally expect to be displayed only by quantum - mechanical systems . in particular , in our numerical studies we have found that complex classical systems can exhibit tunneling - like behavior .    among the complex potentials we have studied are periodic potentials , and we have discovered the surprising result that such classical potentials can have band structure .",
    "our work on periodic potentials naturally leads us to study the complex classical mechanics of _ doubly_-periodic potentials .",
    "we have chosen to examine elliptic potentials because such functions are analytic and thus have well - defined complex continuations .",
    "this is a rich and previously unexplored area of mathematical physics , and in the current paper we report some new discoveries .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] we give a brief review of complex classical mechanics focusing on the complex behavior of a classical particle in a periodic potential . in sec .",

    "[ s4 ] we make some concluding remarks and describe the future objectives of our research program .",
    "during the past decade there has been an active research program to extend quantum mechanics into the complex domain .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that the requirement that a hamiltonian be dirac hermitian ( we say that a hamiltonian is _ dirac - hermitian _ if @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the combined operations of complex conjugation and matrix transposition ) may be broadened to include complex non - dirac - hermitian hamiltonians that are @xmath8 symmetric",
    ". this much wider class of hamiltonians are physically acceptable because they possess two crucial features : ( i ) their eigenvalues are all real , and ( ii ) they describe unitary time evolution .",
    "( we say that a hamiltonian is @xmath8 symmetric if it is invariant under combined spatial reflection and time reversal . )",
    "an example of a class of hamiltonians that is not dirac hermitian but which is @xmath8 symmetric is given by @xmath9 when @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which represents the familiar quantum harmonic oscillator , is dirac hermitian . while @xmath11 is no longer dirac hermitian when @xmath12 increases from @xmath13 , @xmath11 continues to be @xmath8 symmetric , and its eigenvalues continue to be real , positive , and discrete @xcite . because a @xmath8-symmetric quantum system in the complex domain retains the fundamental properties required of a physical quantum theory , much theoretical research on such systems has been published and recent experimental observations have confirmed some theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "complex quantum mechanics has proved to be so interesting that the research activity on @xmath8 quantum mechanics has motivated studies of complex classical mechanics . in the study of complex systems the complex as well as",
    "the real solutions to hamilton s differential equations of motion are considered . in this generalization of conventional classical mechanics , classical particles",
    "are not constrained to move along the real axis and may travel through the complex plane",
    ".    early work on the particle trajectories in complex classical mechanics is reported in refs .",
    "subsequently , detailed studies of the complex extensions of various one - dimensional conventional classical - mechanical systems were undertaken : the remarkable properties of complex classical trajectories are examined in refs .",
    "higher dimensional complex classical - mechanical systems , such as the lotka - volterra equations for population dynamics and the euler equations for rigid body rotation are discussed in refs .",
    "the complex @xmath8-symmetric korteweg - de vries equation has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the objective in extending classical mechanics into the complex domain is to enhance our understanding of subtle mathematical and physical phenomena .",
    "for example , it was found that some of the complicated properties of chaotic systems become more transparent when extended into the complex domain @xcite .",
    "also , studies of exceptional points of complex systems have revealed interesting and potentially observable effects @xcite .",
    "finally , recent work on the complex extension of quantum probability density constitutes an advance in our understanding of the quantum correspondence principle @xcite .",
    "an elementary example that illustrates the extension of a conventional classical - mechanical system into the complex plane is given by the classical harmonic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is given in ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath10 .",
    "the standard classical equations of motion for this system are @xmath14 however , we now treat the coordinate variable @xmath15 and the momentum variable @xmath16 to be _ complex _ functions of time @xmath17 .",
    "that is , we consider this system to have one _ complex _ degree of freedom .",
    "thus , the equations of motion become @xmath18 where the complex coordinate is @xmath19 and the complex momentum is @xmath20 . for a particle having real energy @xmath21 and initial",
    "position @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the solution to ( [ e3 ] ) is @xmath24 thus , the possible classical trajectories are a family of ellipses parametrized by the initial position @xmath25 : @xmath26 five of these trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "each trajectory has the same period @xmath27 .",
    "the degenerate ellipse , whose foci are the turning points at @xmath28 , is the familiar real solution .",
    "note that classical particles may visit the real axis in the classically forbidden regions @xmath29 , but that the elliptical trajectories are _ orthogonal rather than parallel to the real-@xmath5 axis_.    .",
    "these trajectories are nested ellipses .",
    "observe that when the harmonic oscillator is extended into the complex-@xmath5 domain , the classical particles may pass through the classically forbidden regions on the real axis outside the turning points .",
    "when the trajectories cross the real axis , they are orthogonal to it . ]    in general , when classical mechanics is extended into the complex domain , classical particles are allowed to enter the classically forbidden region . however , in the forbidden region there is no particle flow parallel to the real axis and the flow of classical particles is _ orthogonal _ to the axis .",
    "this feature is analogous to the vanishing flux of energy in the case of total internal reflection .    in the case of total internal reflection when the angle of incidence is less than a critical value , there is a reflected wave but no transmitted wave .",
    "the electromagnetic field does cross the boundary and this field is attenuated exponentially in a few wavelengths beyond the interface .",
    "although the field does not vanish in the classically forbidden region , there is no flux of energy ; that is , the poynting vector vanishes in the classically forbidden region beyond the interface .",
    "we emphasize that in the physical world the cutoff at the boundary between the classically allowed and the classically forbidden regions is not perfectly sharp .",
    "for example , in classical optics it is known that below the surface of an imperfect conductor , the electromagnetic fields do not vanish abruptly .",
    "rather , they decay exponentially as functions of the penetration depth .",
    "this effect is known as _ skin depth _ @xcite .",
    "another model that illustrates the properties of the classically allowed and classically forbidden regions is the anharmonic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is @xmath30 for this hamiltonian there are four turning points , two on the real axis and two on the imaginary axis . when the energy is real and positive , all the classical trajectories are closed and periodic except for two special trajectories that begin at the turning points on the imaginary axis .",

    "all trajectories represent a particle of energy @xmath31 .",

    "( the turning points are indicated by dots . )",
    "two other trajectories begin at the imaginary turning points and drift off to infinity along the imaginary-@xmath5 axis .",
    "apart from the trajectories beginning at @xmath34 , all trajectories are closed and periodic .",
    "all orbits in this figure have the same period @xmath35 . ]",
    "the topology of the classical trajectories changes dramatically if the classical energy is allowed to be complex : when @xmath36 , the classical paths no longer closed .",

    "the trajectory does not cross itself . ]",
    "[ f3 ]    the observation that classical orbits are closed and periodic when the energy is real and open and nonperiodic when the energy is complex was made in ref .",
    "@xcite and studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in these references",
    "it is emphasized that the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition @xmath39 can only be applied if the classical orbits are closed .",
    "thus , there is a deep connection between real classical energies and the existence of associated real quantum eigenvalues .",
    "it was further argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the measurement of a quantum energy is inherently imprecise because of the time - energy uncertainty principle @xmath40 .",
    "specifically , since there is not an infinite amount of time in which to make a quantum energy measurement , we expect that the uncertainty in the energy @xmath41 is nonzero .",
    "if we then suppose that this uncertainty has an imaginary component , it follows that in the corresponding classical theory , while the particle trajectories are almost periodic , the orbits do not close exactly .",
    "the fact that the classical orbits with complex energy are not closed means that in complex classical mechanics one can observe tunneling - like phenomena that one normally expects to find only in quantum systems .",
    "we illustrate such tunneling - like phenomena by considering a particle in a quartic double - well potential @xmath42 . figure [ f4 ] shows eight possible complex classical trajectories for a particle of _ real _ energy @xmath43 .",
    "each of these trajectories is closed and periodic .",

    "the classical particle stays in either the right - half or the left - half plane and can not cross the imaginary axis .",
    "thus , when the energy is real , there is no effect analogous to tunneling . ]",
    "what happens if we allow the classical energy to be complex ? in this case the classical trajectory is no longer closed .",
    "however , it does not spiral out to infinity like the trajectory shown in fig .",

    "[ f5 ] unwinds around a pair of turning points for a characteristic length of time and then crosses the imaginary axis . at this point",
    "the trajectory does something remarkable : rather than continuing its outward journey , it spirals _ inward _ towards the other pair of turning points .",
    "then , never crossing itself , the trajectory turns outward again , and after the same characteristic length of time , returns to the vicinity of the first pair of turning points .",
    "this oscillatory behavior , which shares the qualitative characteristics of strange attractors , continues forever but the trajectory never crosses itself . as in the case of quantum tunneling , the particle spends a long time in proximity to a given pair of turning points before crossing the imaginary axis to the other pair of turning points . on average , the classical particle spends equal amounts of time on either side of the imaginary axis .",
    "interestingly , we find that as the imaginary part of the classical energy increases , the characteristic `` tunneling '' time decreases in inverse proportion , just as one would expect of a quantum particle .",
    "plane under the influence of a double - well @xmath44 potential .",
    "the particle has complex energy @xmath47 and thus its trajectory does not close .",
    "the trajectory spirals outward around one pair of turning points , crosses the imaginary axis , and then spirals inward around the other pair of turning points .",
