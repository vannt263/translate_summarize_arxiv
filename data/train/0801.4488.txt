    "the total magnetic field may be amplified if the energy of unstable magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves becomes comparable with the energy of the background magnetic field .",
    "such an amplification seems quite possible because quasilinear theory of the resonant streaming instability allows it ( see e.g. mckenzie & vlk @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of amplified magnetic fields in young snrs is well established now .",
    "it was indicated by the radio observations of snrs and was attributed to the rayleigh - taylor instability of the contact discontinuity between the gas of supernova ejecta compressed at the reverse shock and the circumstellar gas compressed at the forward shock ( gull @xcite ) .",

    "this conclusion does not depend on the nature of the mechanism which produces such filaments : the fast synchrotron cooling of electrons accelerated at the forward shock ( see e.g. the analysis by berezhko et al .",

    "it is interesting that formula ( 21 ) without the root in the denominator may be used to estimate the maximum energy of particles , accelerated at slow astrophysical shocks when the condition ( 22 ) is violated and the resonant streaming instability should be taken into account .",
    "the matter is that the expression for the increment of the non - resonant instability ( 17 ) differs from the increment of the resonant instability only by a factor of the order of unity ( see e.g. berezinskii et al .",

    "however , it is possible that stellar winds contain significant random magnetic fluctuations and we may expect that some part of a snr shock surface may be treated as a parallel shock .",
    "this also will provide the injection of thermal particles into the diffusive shock acceleration process since it is known that the injection of thermal ions occurs preferentially at the parallel shocks ( see vlk et al .",
    "@xcite for discussion of these topics ) .",
    "the cas a is a ib type supernova .",
    "the maximum energy was larger in the past because the small radius of the shock in eq .",
    "( 21 ) was compensated by the higher gas density of the stellar wind and the higher shock velocity .",
    "thus the velocity @xmath230 km s@xmath60 gives the maximum energy @xmath231 @xmath203 pev .",
    "therefore such supernovae can accelerate cosmic ray protons up to pev energies .    because the maximum momentum ( 21 ) decreases at the sedov stage when the age of the remnant increases , the highest energy particles leave the remnant . the overall spectrum produced by the snr is formed in this manner ( ptuskin & zirakashvili @xcite ) with the energy spectrum close to @xmath232 . at the earlier free expansion stage when only a small amount of the supernova ejecta energy is transferred to the supernova shock the steep high energy tail in the spectrum",
    "is formed ( berezhko & vlk @xcite , ptuskin & zirakashvili @xcite ) .",

    "it is about @xmath233 km s@xmath60 for ia / b / c and iib supernovae .",
    "we should note that the shock velocities in table 2 are based on radio and x - ray expansion measurements . if we use the lower shock velocities from vlk et al .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding maximum energies are a factor of 2 smaller .",
    "it is clear from fig.7 that the amplified magnetic field does not drop downstream of the shock .",
    "its level is maintained by the turbulent motions produced by the interaction of density inhomogeneities with the shock front .",
    "however , the amplitude of these motions slowly decreases downstream of the shock . at some distance magnetic and kinetic energies will become equal to each other . at larger distances",
    "magnetic dissipation may occur .",
    "these distances are larger than @xmath234 according to fig.7 .",
    "we conclude that the dissipation length of the magnetic field downstream of the shock is not smaller than @xmath235 in our numerical simulation .    the interaction of the shock front with density disturbances results in the shock front deformation ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "the thickness of x - ray rims produced by the synchrotron cooling of accelerated electrons should increase correspondingly up to the values about 0.01@xmath22 according to fig.7 ( a so - called projection effect is not taken into account here ) .",
    "probably this is the reason for the relatively small value of the magnetic field @xmath236 @xmath237 g in cas a inferred from the width of x - ray filaments in comparison with the theoretical value expected at @xmath238 , see table 2 .",
    "the characteristic time of the random motions of the shock front is given by the ratio of the size of density inhomogeneities and the shock velocity .",

    "this means that the acceleration of particles can be considered in the one - dimensional approximation even for a three - dimensional system .",
    "the characteristic width of the particle distribution in our simulations is not larger than @xmath244 ( see fig.3 and 10th line of table 1 ) .",
    "\\3 ) it is important , that the non - resonant instability produces strong density fluctuations upstream of the shock ( see sect.4 and paper i ) .",
    "these fluctuations produce a strong deformation of the shock front and fast vortex motions downstream of the shock . that is why the magnetic amplification in the shock transition region is not reduced to a simple compression of the magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the shock front .",

    "the magnetic field component which is perpendicular to the shock front is a factor of 1.4 larger than the parallel components downstream of the shock .",
    "this naturally explains the preferable radial orientation of magnetic fields in young snrs .",

    "\\4 ) the dissipation of the magnetic field downstream of the shock is relatively slow in our simulation .",
