    "albeit rare , massive stars are the main contributors to the input of ionizing photons , energy , and momentum into the interstellar medium , and are responsible for a significant fraction of the chemical enrichment of their host galaxy .",
    "massive stars evolve on relatively short timescales ( a few @xmath14  years ) , and their evolution is strongly influenced by their strong mass loss and rotation ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "tremendous advancement in the understanding of the evolution of massive stars has been achieved in recent decades @xcite . in particular",
    ", we now have insights into the effects of rotation on the evolution of massive stars @xcite .",
    "the models predict the existence of a short - lived , transitional stage , usually referred to as the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase @xcite , during which the star has a high mass - loss rate ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) . in the current picture of stellar evolution ,",
    "lbvs are rapidly evolving massive stars in the transitory phase from being an o - type star burning hydrogen in its core to a hydrogen - poor wolf - rayet , helium - core burning star @xcite .",
    "the lbv phase is likely an unavoidable evolutionary stage which massive stars with initial mass @xmath17 will experience during their lifetime before becoming wrs and exploding as a supernova @xcite .",
    "whether lbv progenitors have an upper limit for @xmath18 , as suggested by the latest evolutionary models @xcite , still remains to be seen .",
    "several lbvs , such as eta car @xcite , ag car @xcite , and the pistol star @xcite , among others ( see @xcite ) , are known to have bolometric luminosities in excess of @xmath19 , which suggests a progenitor with @xmath20 .",
    "following recent determinations that the mass - loss rates of o - type stars are a factor of 320 lower than those adopted by the evolutionary models cited above @xcite , and the detection of massive nebulae around lbvs , there is growing evidence supporting the idea that the evolution of massive stars is even more dominated by strong mass loss during the lbv phase than previously thought @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , some recent work suggests that some core - collapse sne have lbv progenitors @xcite , which dramatically enhances the cosmological importance of lbvs and poses a great challenge to the current paradigm of massive star evolution .",
    "some of these type - ii sne occurred just a few years after the progenitor suffered a giant mass ejection  la eta carinae in the 1840 s @xcite , raising the following provocative hypothesis as to the near - term fate of eta car itself and other lbvs  lbvs might fail to lose additional significant amounts of mass and , thus , never become a wolf - rayet star @xcite .",
    "only a dozen or so lbvs are known in the galaxy @xcite , and determining their fundamental parameters and evolutionary status is a key to understanding unstable massive stars and population iii objects in the high - redshift universe .",
    "ag carinae ( = hd 94910 , @xmath21=10h56m11.6s , @xmath22=-60d27min12.8s ) is one of the brightest and most famous lbv stars .",

    "its high luminosity was first reported by @xcite , who also noticed the presence of a bipolar nebula around the central star .    after these pioneering works , intense observing campaigns in the past decades have provided a wealth of observational data on ag car , showing that the star has photometric , spectroscopic , and polarimetric variability on timescales from days to decades ( @xcite ; see references in @xcite ) .",

    "the photometric and spectroscopic observations of ag car during visual minimum were extensively described in and references therein , to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "the detailed spectroscopic analysis of ag car during visual minimum was done using the radiative transfer code cmfgen @xcite and was presented in .",
    "cmfgen has been successfully used to study other lbvs and related objects @xcite .",
    "since the code has been extensively discussed in the aforementioned references and in , we concisely describe its main characteristics below .",
    "cmfgen assumes a spherical - symmetric , steady - state outflow and computes continuum and line formation in the non - lte regime .",

    "the radius of the hydrostatic core is defined as @xmath29 , in order to avoid any effects due to the strong wind in the determination of @xmath30 .",

    ", we assume that ag car is located at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we refer to for further discussion on the effects of the distance on the derived parameters .",
    "cmfgen does not solve the hydrodynamic equations to determine the wind structure , and therefore , a velocity law @xmath32 needs to be assumed a priori . in cmfgen",
    ", the velocity law is parameterized by a beta - type velocity law which is modified at depth to smoothly merge with a quasi - hydrostatic structure at the sonic point .",
    "the velocity structure below the sonic point is iterated to fulfill the wind momentum equation with a maximum error of 10% for @xmath33 .",
    "systematic errors in the density structure below the sonic point might be present due to the proximity of the star to the eddington limit and the choice of @xmath27 , rotation rate , and viewing angle .",
    "cmfgen allows for the presence of clumping within the wind .",
    "this is accomplished by assuming a homogeneous wind at distances close to the star , and that clumps start to be formed at a given velocity @xmath34 .",

    "after comparing the lightcurve and the spectroscopic evolution during both visual minimum phases , it can be noted that the star presents different characteristics in these epochs .",
    "an inspection of the ag car lightcurve shows that the visual minimum phases of 19851990 and 20002003 are significantly different , especially regarding their duration .",
    "while the star was in a visual minimum phase for about 5 years between 19851990 , the duration of the following visual minimum of 2000 - 2003 was much shorter , between 2 and 3 years .",
    "there are also significant qualitative differences in the spectrum obtained at different visual minimum phases of ag car , which can be inferred by comparing spectral lines of , , and .",
    "figure [ comphotphases ] displays , for each visual minimum , the spectrum obtained during the epoch when the maximum value of @xmath0 was achieved , corresponding to 19851990 and 20002001 .",
    "figure [ comphotphases ] presents the spectra obtained in 1987 june , 1989 march , and 2001 april , centered in three key lines for which high - resolution spectra were available : h@xmath37 , 5876 , and 4686 .",
    "h@xmath37 emission , in both the line core and the electron - scattering wings , was much stronger in 2001 than in 19851990 , indicating that the wind was denser in 2001 .",
    "the p - cygni absorption component of h@xmath37 was much deeper in 2001 , while it was almost absent in 19851990 .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath38 energy level population of h was higher in 2001 , which was probably caused by the lower @xmath0 and , thus , increased amount of neutral h. we will come back to this point in sect . [ ionouter ] .",
    "the 4686 emission , on the other hand , was stronger in 19851990 than in 2001 , confirming that @xmath0 was higher in 19851990 than in 2001 .",
    "the line emission of 5876 was stronger in 2001 than in 19851990 , but this was due to the increased wind density and not because of a higher @xmath0 , since the latter would also imply increased 4686 emission , and the opposite is seen .",
    "the p - cygni absorption profiles of h@xmath37 and 5876 both indicate that the wind terminal velocity was lower in 2001 than in 19851990 .",
    "the detailed spectroscopic analysis using cmfgen models confirms the above scenario and allows us to make quantitative conclusions through the comparison of the physical parameters obtained in the epochs when the maximum stellar temperature was achieved in consecutive visual minimum phases .",
    "while @xmath39 was similar and @xmath30 was only 10% different , three other physical parameters were significantly different ; namely , @xmath40 , @xmath25 , and @xmath41 .",
    "notably , @xmath0 was approximately 5800 k higher in 19851990 than in 2001 , while @xmath26 was 23 times higher and @xmath42 roughly two times smaller in 19851990 than in 20002003 .    based on our modeling",
    ", we suggest that the differences in the lightcurve and in the spectrum of ag car during consecutive visual minimum phases are caused by the strikingly different _ wind _ parameters due to a change in the underlying stellar parameters .",
    "_ this is contrary to the current ideas about the nature of the s dor cycles , where the visual minimum phase is representative of a quiescent phase of the lbv star . in this scenario ,",
    "visual minimum phases should be equal to each other , which is not the case for ag car .",
    "_ thus , the questions to be answered are : why are the physical parameters different in consecutive visual minimum phases ? is there any intrinsic reason for this to occur ?    the differences in @xmath0 , @xmath42 , and @xmath26 during the minimum phases of ag car are immediately reminiscent of the bistability mechanism seen in line - driven winds @xcite , which has already been suggested to be responsible for the variable mass - loss rate seen in ag car @xcite . before going further and analyzing whether our results agree with previous works , we shall briefly summarize the physics behind the bistability mechanism .",
    "there are two potential effects related to sudden changes in the stellar parameters , which are commonly referred to as bistability .",
    "first , according to the original proposition of @xcite when analyzing models for the lbv p  cygni , the classical bistability mechanism is characterized by a change in the optical depth of the lyman continuum ( @xmath43 ) , which in turn changes the ionization stages of metals in the wind , causing a change in the amount of line driving , and thus , ultimately changing @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "later , this concept was extended to a bistability _ jump _ by @xcite to explain the physical parameters of blue supergiants , suggesting that the winds of those stars have two different regimes of @xmath42 and @xmath41 , which switch abruptly from one to the other around 21,000  k. @xcite proposed that blue supergiants with @xmath44 could typically have @xmath42 2 times higher ( correspondingly , @xmath26 is 2 times lower ) than blue supergiants with @xmath45 .",
    "the physical explanation for this phenomenon is a change in the ionization structure of iron in the inner stellar wind @xcite , which changes the number of spectral lines able to absorb / scatter radiation and , thus , able to drive the wind .",
    "this in turn affects the value of @xmath42 and @xmath41@xcite .    while the @xcite work referred to the wind of a single lbv star , @xcite and @xcite were analyzing _ different _ ob supergiants .",
    "both ideas were combined by @xcite , who suggested that the variable mass loss commonly inferred for lbvs is due to subtle changes in the line driving due to recombination / ionization of fe@xmath46 into fe@xmath47 and fe@xmath47 into fe@xmath48 .",
    "however , based on a detailed spectroscopic analysis with cmfgen of a large sample of ob stars , the idea of a  jump \" in @xmath42 and @xmath26 of ob supergiants around @xmath45 has been disputed by @xcite , who suggest a more continuous variation of @xmath42 and @xmath26 with temperature .",
    "second , there is also the wind instability , which causes sudden changes in the h@xmath37 line profiles , intensity of lines , and @xmath43 , for a relative small change in @xmath39 , @xmath27 , and/or @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is well known in lbvs and has been discussed in the literature for p cygni @xcite , hde  316285 @xcite , and eta carinae @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the wind instability and the classical bistability appear to occur at similar @xmath0 , causing feedback effects as discussed by @xcite .      in order to check whether the bistability mechanism can explain the presence of different stellar and wind parameters in consecutive visual minimum phases of ag car , we first turn our attention to the underlying cause of the bistability mechanism , which is the change in @xmath43 .",
    "we analyzed the behavior of @xmath43 in selected models obtained for both minima , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ lymancontion ] . while we obtained @xmath49 throughout the wind during 19851990 ( i.e. optically thin ) , an increase by three orders of magnitude in @xmath43 was derived in models during 20002003 , making the lyman continuum completely optically thick .",
    "therefore , we first conclude that _ the different stellar parameters at the base of the wind of ag car in different visual minimum phases cause a huge change in @xmath43 , which in turn cause significant differences in @xmath42 and @xmath26 , implying a very different spectral morphology . _ in particular",
    ", we conclude that when ag car had @xmath50 ( i.e. , during 19851990 ) , the lyman continuum was optically thin , @xmath42 was @xmath51 times lower than in 2001 , and @xmath52 times higher than in 2001 , when the lyman continuum was optically thick and @xmath53 .",
    "our results confirm the findings from @xcite that ag car lies on different sides of the bistability regime at different epochs @xcite .",
    "we found that between 19851990 , ag car had @xmath54 k , which we interpret as being on the hot side of the bistability regime , while in 2001 ag car had @xmath55 k , which we interpret as the star crossing the bistability limit into the cool side .",
    "this result implies that the effective temperature for occurrence of the bistability in ag car is somewhere between 17,000 k and 22,800 k. based on our detailed cmfgen spectroscopic analysis , we suggest that this limit is closer to the earlier , around 17,000k  18,000 k , because in this case , small changes of 5% in @xmath56 , @xmath25 , and/or @xmath30 caused significant changes in @xmath43 , in the ionization structure of the wind , and in the emerging spectrum .",
    "we shall now discuss the iron ionization structure predicted by our cmfgen modeling in the inner wind of ag car , since the huge change in @xmath43 is expected to impact the iron ionization structure @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of several physical processes in the current generation of radiative transfer stellar wind codes such as cmfgen turned out to be crucial for the analysis of the ionization structure of the wind of early - type stars .",
    "in particular , the exact treatment of radiative transfer in the co - moving frame , the inclusion of full line blanketing , wind clumping , and consistent modeling of the wind and photosphere have all had a huge effect on the ionization structure of early - type stars ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "we anticipate that the ionization structure of lbv stars will also be affected .",
    "the fe ionization structure of ag car during 19851990 and 20002003 obtained from the cmfgen models is presented in the bottom row of figure [ lymancontion ] .",
    "we noticed that the ionization structure of fe before the sonic point , which is around @xmath57 for all the above models and below which @xmath42 is set , is modified when @xmath43 changes . during 19851990",
    "the dominant ionization stage was fe@xmath46 , while in the following visual minimum phase of 2001 there is a steady increase in fe@xmath47 as @xmath0 decreased .",
    "since fe@xmath47 has a higher opacity than fe@xmath46 , particularly in the region where the stellar flux is high , more momentum can be removed from the radiation field and transferred to the wind , causing a higher mass - loss rate . nevertheless , as seen in fig .",
    "[ lymancontion ] , fe@xmath46 is still the dominant ionization stage below the sonic point in the temperature regime found for ag car during visual minimum .",
    "@xcite proposed that the bistability mechanism is the cause of the variable behavior of the mass - loss of lbvs as a function of the effective temperature , predicting the presence of jumps in the @xmath42 vs. @xmath0 relationship at @xmath58 and @xmath59 due to the recombination of fe@xmath46 into fe@xmath47 and fe@xmath47 into fe@xmath48 , respectively .",
    "figure [ mdotvinfmin ] presents @xmath42 as a function of @xmath0 during the visual minimum epochs of ag car analyzed in paper i. is there clear evidence of a jump in @xmath42 as a function of @xmath0 as ag car crosses from one side of the bistability regime to the other ? from the point of view of the spectroscopic modeling , we can not give a definitive answer to this question for the following reasons .",
    "in general , we can see a progressive increase in @xmath42 when @xmath0 decreases in the range @xmath60 .",
    "close to the region where the lyman continuum becomes optically thick ( aka the bistability limit ) at @xmath61 , we can identify ag car in the two regimes predicted by @xcite . on the hot side ,",
    "@xmath42 is lower than on the cool side , while @xmath26 is higher .",
    "however , whether the star switches abruptly from one regime to another or changes gradually can not be determined since ag car has never been observed at temperatures very close to the bistability limit .",
    "long - term spectroscopic monitoring has shown that @xmath0 of ag car decreases quickly from visual minimum to maximum ( on timescales of a few months , @xcite ; paper iii ) , and monitoring ag car in intervals of weeks would be required . even then , our ability to derive the stellar and wind parameters would likely be hampered by strong time - dependent effects , since the flow timescale during these epochs is also of the order of a few months . nevertheless",
    ", we can conclude from the short timescale that the stellar wind is highly unstable when close to the bistability limit , and the inner layers might be exposed to some sort of feedback from the unstable wind @xcite .",
    "the differences in our results from the predictions of @xcite are likely a combination three factors : a ) the inclusion of full line blanketing and wind clumping in our analysis , b ) the higher @xmath62 derived in our work compared to the value assumed by @xcite , and c ) due to the fact that the ratio @xmath63 is definitely not constant when @xmath0 changes , contrary to the assumption of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 and @xmath63 of ag car are greatly modified by rapid rotation @xcite , a phenomenon which was not included in the @xcite models .",
    "the influence of rotation will also be variable as a function of @xmath0 , since the ratio @xmath64 changes from visual minimum toward maximum ( @xcite ; see sect .",
    "[ rot ] ) .    the behavior of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath0 is more irregular .",
    "first , there is a decrease in @xmath26 from @xmath65 until @xmath66 .",
    "then , a steep increase until @xmath67 is seen , and a shallow decrease again until @xmath68 .",
    "while the overall behavior of @xmath26 might be explained in terms of the bistability mechanism through changes in the line driving @xcite , there are a number of physical mechanisms which likely have a large impact on the behavior of @xmath26 on the cool side : the fast rotation derived in ag car , the presence of a latitude - dependent wind and departure from spherical symmetry , the accuracy of the velocity structure near the sonic point , and time - dependent effects .",
    "the presence of strong lines in the spectrum of ag car during the visual minimum of 20002003 ( which were absent during 19851990 ) provide solid evidence that the ionization structure of the _ outer _ wind of ag car was also different in those minima .",
    "figure [ agcionesttot ] presents the h and fe ionization structures in the whole wind of ag car during visual minimum phases as derived from the cmfgen models with the parameters from .",
    "it can be seen that in addition to the recombination of fe@xmath46 into fe@xmath47 in the inner wind during the 20002003 visual minimum , there is also recombination of h@xmath48 into h@xmath69 and of fe@xmath47 into fe@xmath48 in the outer wind of ag car .",
    "this explains the appearance of p - cygni absorptions during the latter visual minimum , which is only possible when a significant ( @xmath70 ) fraction of hydrogen is recombined . the same mechanism explains the absence of p - cygni absorption during 19851990 , since hydrogen was ionized throughout the whole wind .",
    "in addition , as first noted by @xcite and @xcite , the fe ionization structure in the outer wind is dominated by the following charge - exchange reaction with h , @xmath71 this reaction implies that hydrogen recombination is also responsible for the recombination of fe@xmath47 into fe@xmath48 , thus explaining why there are no strong fe ii lines in the 19851990 spectrum while they are relatively strong in data from 20002003",
    ".    the marked difference in the ionization structure of the outer wind during different visual minimum phases of ag car led us to investigate whether the recombination of hydrogen and fe@xmath47 into fe@xmath48 in the outer wind and the consequent appearance of a p - cyg absorption component are also due to the bistability mechanism ( i.e. change in the optical depth of the lyman continuum ) .",
    "we found that when @xmath43 increases , the relative population between the hydrogen levels 2 and 1 also increases , and so does the optical depth of the balmer lines , such as h@xmath37 and h@xmath72 , explaining the increase in the absorption of those lines .",
    "interestingly , variable p - cygni absorption has been observed in the lbv candidate he 3 - 519 @xcite , which might indicate that he 3 - 519 is also close to the bistability limit .",
    "further work is highly desirable in order to prove whether this speculation holds for lbvs in general .",
    "the analysis of broad absorptions due to 40884116  in the high - resolution ag car spectra obtained during the 20002003 visual minimum has shown direct evidence , for the first time , that some lbvs rotate at a high fraction of their critical rotational velocity @xcite . using a similar methodology ,",
    "the bona - fide lbv hr carinae was also shown to possess a rotational velocity close to critical @xcite .",
    "since the lines were also present in ag car during the 19851990 visual minimum @xcite , we analyzed whether a similar fast rotation could be noticed during these epochs .",
    "exactly the same technique as described in @xcite was employed .",
    "although the spectra of ag car obtained in 1989 march have only moderate resolution around the lines ( r@xmath73100 @xmath74 ) , significant evidence of fast rotation can be inferred from the comparison between the observed spectrum and the 2-d models presented in fig .",
    "[ agcvrotr ] .",
    "the line profiles from models without rotation , convolved to the same spectral resolution as the observations , are narrower and have stronger central absorption than the observed line profiles of ag car from 1989 march .",
    "_ this is clear evidence that fast rotation is present . _",
    "the best fit was achieved using @xmath75 , mainly using 4088 as a diagnostic ( fig .",
    "[ agcvrotr]a , ) since 4116 is severely blended with 4120 at the data resolution ( fig .",
    "[ agcvrotr]b ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath76 likely had similar values during the whole 19851990 visual minimum , since there was little variability in the stellar parameters during these epochs .",
    "indeed , a tracing of a medium resolution photographic - plate spectrum of ag car obtained in 1985 @xcite shows broad 40884116 absorptions which are very similar to those predicted by our rotating models .",
    "figure [ agcvrotr]c presents the rotational velocity of ag car as a function of @xmath30 for each epoch . using a least - squares linear fit , we obtained @xmath77 , where the quoted error only includes the statistical errors .",
    "additional systematic errors , which are currently hard to estimate , might be present due to model assumptions . a flatter dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath30 might be obtained when including the deformation of the stellar surface from spherical symmetry , variation of the stellar and wind parameters as a function of latitude , and a more complex treatment of the density structure at and below the sonic point in the model . as a consequence , we can not exclude that @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , our result strongly suggests that magnetic fields are not important on the surface of ag car ; otherwise , significant deviations from the above relationship would be expected ( a. maeder , private communication ) .",
    "if the magnetic field on the hydrostatic surface of ag car played an important role , one would expect that the magnetic field would maintain the surface material corotating out to some distance . in this case",
    ", the surface rotational velocity would behave as that of a solid body , i.e. , increasing with @xmath30 .",
    "this is contradictory with our findings .",
    "the rotational period of ag car during 19851990 is @xmath79 days , assuming @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "lbv stars have low - amplitude photometric variability ( the so - called  micro - variability \" ) in timescales of days to weeks @xcite .",
    "generally , the currently accepted mechanism for such behavior is non - radial pulsation @xcite . in the case of ag car ,",
    "the micro - variability period during 19851990 was between 1114 days @xcite .",
    "the similarity between the values of @xmath82 and the micro - variability period is striking .",
    "we suggest that they might be related to each other and that the micro - variability is modulated by the rotational period of ag car , which would be the case if spots are present on the stellar photosphere , for instance .",
    "since the stellar photosphere of ag car is extended and located in the stellar wind , the presence of spots would suggest that structures propagate from the stellar surface into the wind , possibly causing effects on line profiles .",
    "if the photometric micro - variability is indeed modulated by rotation , we anticipate that the micro - variability period should be proportional to @xmath83 in the case of ag car , since @xmath76 is proportional to @xmath84 for ag car .",
    "if rotation is somehow related to the micro - variability of lbvs , in principle , their rotational velocities could be derived from the micro - variability period once the stellar radius @xmath30 is known .",
    "this analysis is beyond the scope of this paper and is the subject of an ongoing work .",
    "it is interesting to note that for other lbvs such as hr car and s dor , the variations in the micro - variability period between visual minimum and maximum is about 5 @xcite , which is consistent with a rotational modulation .",
    "in this section we compare the fundamental parameters obtained for ag car with the evolutionary tracks from @xcite ( hereafter mm03 ) .",
    "there are a couple of caveats which need to be considered : 1 ) the problematic definition of @xmath0 in lbvs and wrs because of the presence of an optically - thick wind and 2 ) the strong , long - term variability seen in ag car during the s - dor cycle .",
    "the first issue is a direct consequence of the high mass - loss rate of lbvs and wrs , which causes the presence of an extended photosphere .",
    "the hydrostatic base of the wind ( @xmath30 in our definition ) has a higher temperature ( @xmath85 ) than that of the photosphere ( @xmath0 , defined at @xmath86 ) .",

    "one possibility is that the initial rotational velocity of ag car was significantly lower than 300  @xmath74 .",
    "another possibility is that additional processes need to be taken into account by the evolutionary models in order to fully explain the stellar properties during the lbv phase .",
    "for instance , it would be desirable to include giant outbursts of several @xmath92 in the evolutionary models to investigate the effects of this event on the evolution of an lbv .",

    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath27 in this parameter regime can be understood as being due to the formation of a progressively more extended photosphere as the star approaches the eddington limit .",

    "can be obtained by computing the mass budget throughout the evolution of ag car .",
    "if we take into account that ag car has a massive nebula ( @xmath136 ) composed of material from the star @xcite and an initial mass of @xmath132 , then the mass budget is tight : ag car would have @xmath137 assuming zero mass loss during the ms and bsg phases . a more realistic estimate of @xmath138 during @xmath139 years would lead to @xmath140 . if the mass - loss rate during the ms and bsg phases was even lower , we could make the case for ag car having @xmath141 .",

    "the evolution of lbvs during their s - dor cycles is commonly assumed to be due to changes in the stellar radius at constant luminosity @xcite , which imply changes in the effective temperature .",
    "based on a detailed spectroscopic analysis of multi - epoch observations of ag car using cmfgen , we argue that this scenario needs some revisions in order to explain the temporal behavior of the physical parameters of ag car which are shown in fig .",
    "[ physparmin ] .",
    "we found that the stellar radius of ag car changes during the s - dor cycles , increasing from visual minimum to maximum , as has been determined by previous works ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "however , unlike previous works , using cmfgen we can precisely derive both the hydrostatic radius of ag car ( @xmath143 , defined as @xmath144 ) and the photospheric radius ( @xmath145 , defined at @xmath86 ) for a given epoch , and thus , compare how they change as a function of time .",
    "we found that both @xmath30 _ and _ @xmath146 increase from visual minimum to maximum , ruling out that the s - dor type variability is caused only by an expanding pseudo - photosphere due to an increase in @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "the relatively high @xmath42 derived for ag car compared to b supergiants in the same temperature range , in combination with the proximity of the star to the eddington limit , causes the unavoidable formation of an extended pseudo - photosphere , which translates into different values for @xmath30 and @xmath146 .",
    "a major result from is that the bolometric luminosity of ag car decreases during the expansion of the hydrostatic radius , which is contrary to the aforementioned _ status quo _ explanation for the s - dor variability .",
    "the detection of a decrease in @xmath39 is not unique to ag car ; @xcite also detected that another famous , highly - variable lbv , s doradus , presents a similar behavior .",

    "variations in @xmath39 were also detected in the lbv afgl 2298 @xcite .",
    "however , in this latter case , the variation of @xmath39 were apparently not related to changes in @xmath30 .",
    "another striking result is that the eddington parameter @xmath95 of ag car _ decreases _ as the star expands and its @xmath39 and @xmath0 decrease ( fig .",
    "[ physparmin ] ) .",
    "such a reduction is , at least in part , caused by the decrease in @xmath39 .",
    "for ag car , @xmath147 during the hottest epochs , and decreases to @xmath148 as the star evolves toward maximum .",
    "the eddington parameter modified by rotation @xmath6 is even more dramatically reduced from visual minimum to maximum ( fig .",
    "[ physparmin ] ) , since rotation will be relatively more important when the star has a higher @xmath0 ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "while ag car is significantly close to the eddington limit modified by rotation ( @xmath149 during 19851990 and 2001 april ) during visual minimum , we found that @xmath150 as the star expands . therefore , if the proximity to the eddington limit reflects the instability of the outer layers of ag car , the star is more unstable during visual minimum than during maximum .",
    "the evolution of the wind parameters of ag car is regulated by the bistability mechanism ( sect .",
    "[ compbi ] ) . however , the behavior of the mass - loss rates and wind terminal velocities obtained in do not closely follow the predictions of @xcite .",
    "this is due to several reasons : our modeling determined that ag car is twice as massive as the value derived by @xcite , more luminous , and closer to the eddington limit .",
    "furthermore , ag car has a high rotational velocity which varies from visual minimum to maximum @xcite .",
    "since the models from @xcite do not include rotation , significant differences are anticipated .",
    "the detailed spectroscopic analysis of ag car using the radiative transfer code cmfgen has provided a wealth of information on the lbv phenomenon and on the s - dor type variability .",
    "below , we summarize the main conclusions of this paper .    \\1 . the high rotational velocity of ag car detected by @xcite during the visual minimum of 20012003 was also obtained during the previous visual minimum of 19851990 , amounting to @xmath151 .",
    "we found that the rotational velocity is proportional to @xmath152 , but including systematical errors which might arise due to the star being extremely close to the eddington limit , we can not rule out that @xmath153 .",
    "we noticed that the rotational period of ag car during the visual minimum of 19851990 ( @xmath154 days ) is remarkably similar to the cyclical photometric micro - variability of 1114 days observed during these visual minimum epochs @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the micro - variability period of ag car might be modulated by the stellar rotation .",
    "if rotation is also responsible for the micro - variability seen in other lbvs , in principle , their rotational velocities can be derived using this method .",
    "we found in that the consecutive visual minimum phases of 19851990 and 20002003 are different in duration , maximum magnitude achieved , maximum stellar temperature , mass - loss rate , and wind terminal velocity .",
    "we suggest that these differences arise due to different stellar parameters , which cause different mass - loss rates and wind terminal velocities .",
    "we explain this behavior in terms of the bistability mechanism of line - driven winds , which is ultimately regulated by the optical depth of the lyman continuum . from 19851990 ,",
    "ag car was on the hot side of the bistability ( @xmath40=22800 k ) , while the star was on the cool side ( @xmath40=17000 k ) from 20002003 .",
    "therefore , ag car is the first star ever confirmed to be on different sides of the bistability at different epochs based on detailed spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we noticed that ag car has never been observed exactly _ at _ the boundary of the bistability limit , suggesting that significant instability is present when that happens .",
    "although we identify ag car in two regimes , the absence of observations close to the boundary of crossing from one side to the other of the bistability does not allow us to confirm the presence of a @xmath155 in the wind properties of ag car .",
    "an increase in @xmath42 as a function of @xmath0 was found as the star crosses the bistability limit , while @xmath26 decreases and presents a more complex behavior .",
    "the duration of the last two visual minimum phases of ag car and the variability inside the visual minimum are related to the maximum temperature achieved at each minimum and , therefore , on which side of the bistability the star was .",
    "it seems that visual minimum phases that have @xmath0 high enough to put the star on the hot side of the bistability limit have a longer duration , while visual minimum phases which have @xmath0 low enough to put the star on the cool side , are brief .",
    "this behavior needs to be verified by further spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of ag car during the next decades .",
    "we suggest that the proximity to the eddington limit modified by rotation ( @xmath6 ) plays a key role in explaining the behavior of ag car .",

    "contrary to the current paradigm , the maximum value of the eddington parameter is found during visual minimum , not when the star is evolving towards maximum . therefore , the picture of a quiescent star at visual minimum followed by an eruption during visual maximum due to an increase in the eddington parameter might not correctly describe the s - dor cycles .",
