    "the ability to measure the frequency of an unknown radio frequency ( rf ) or microwave signal , without relying on expensive spectrum analyzers and mixers , is a basic requirement for the development and testing of wireless systems . in particular ,",
    "the ability to do so in real - time ( @xmath0 ns ) and with high accuracy ( @xmath1% error ) is crucial for radar receivers used in electronic warfare ( ew ) @xcite and biomedical technology @xcite .",
    "this is known as instantaneous frequency measurement ( ifm ) , and it involves mapping the signal frequency to a more easily measurable quantity , such as power .",
    "the use of photonics for microwave ifm is attractive due to the possibility of pushing the frequency measurement range far beyond the capacity of electronic - based ifm systems @xcite .",
    "since its conception in 2006 @xcite , research into photonic - based ifm systems has progressed by various means @xcite , and has recently culminated with the demonstration of a number of on - chip ifm systems @xcite .",
    "this trend towards integration is especially important for ifm receivers , where the ifm delay is directly related to the length of the path traveled by the light .",
    "the inherently reduced size of integrated systems can thus lead to sub - nanosecond latency , as well as improved robustness and lower footprint @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most on - chip ifm demonstrations to date achieved measurement bandwidths below 10 ghz @xcite , lower than what is currently possible using electronic ifm systems .",
    "this limit was due to the trade - off between quality factor and free spectral range of the ring resonators employed by these prior demonstrations . a different technique made use of a highly compact on - chip bragg grating filter with promising results , but a relatively high 2% measurement error @xcite .",
    "there are not many techniques that can simultaneously achieve wideband operation and low , sub-1% measurement error .",
    "one such technique relies on mapping the rf signal frequency to the power of an optical idler generated through efficient nonlinear optical mixing , in a low - loss platform @xcite .",
    "the stringent requirements on the nonlinear medium have meant that so far , all implementations @xcite were bound to using hundreds of meters of fiber , introducing high measurement delays . for high - bandwidth ifm , where low latency is key",
    ", it is crucial to harness the nonlinearity efficiently in a low - loss , short platform .    in this work",
    ", we report the first low - latency ifm system using on - chip four - wave mixing ( fwm ) , and demonstrate 40 ghz measurement bandwidth , limited only by the measurement equipment , with record - low 0.8% error .",
    "these ground - breaking results were enabled by the ultra - low loss and efficient fwm in a unique platform : a 35 cm long thick silicon waveguide with a highly compact footprint .",
    "this allowed us to generate an idler with enhanced signal - to - noise ratio , thereby significantly reducing the measurement error below the level demonstrated in fiber - based systems @xcite .",
    "this is a breakthrough for high - performance on - chip ifm systems , and reveals a new and unique material platform for nonlinear optical processing of microwave signals @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the feasibility of integrating the whole ifm system onto a silicon chip , highlighting the potential for implementing the first , ultra - low latency , fully reconfigurable ifm system .",
    "the basic structure of our fwm - based ifm system is shown in fig . [ fig_principle](a ) .",
    "an rf signal of unknown frequency @xmath2 is received and modulates two cw optical carriers at different frequencies @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "this results in two copies of an optical signal , in two different channels .",
    "these two optical signals are then demultiplexed using a coarse wavelength division multiplexer ( cwdm ) . in this way ,",
    "one signal is delayed by @xmath5 relative to the other , before both are recombined .",
    "the two signals are then sent through a nonlinear medium , where they mix through fwm , generating idlers in adjacent channels .",
    "there are three idler components generated in the vicinity of frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the middle component is an idler `` carrier '' , resulting from degenerate fwm ( dfwm ) between the two original carriers .",
    "the two remaining components , or idler sidebands , occur at frequencies @xmath7 .",
    "there are in fact two fwm processes which occur simultaneously , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_principle](b ) , giving rise to two separate pairs of idler sidebands .",
    "the first is a dfwm process , which gives rise to a delayed pair of idler sidebands . neglecting dispersion ,",
    "the complex field for the upper dfwm idler sideband is @xmath8 the second process is a non - degenerate fwm ( ndfwm ) process , where the generated idler pair is a copy of the non - delayed optical signal .",
    "neglecting dispersion , the complex field of the upper ndfwm idler sideband is @xmath9 the total sideband idler field is therefore a coherent sum of two separate idler fields with a differential delay of @xmath5 , resulting in an interference effect .",
    "the total upper idler sideband is given by @xmath10 a similar expression can be derived for the lower idler sideband .",
    "using an optical bandpass filter ( bpf ) the total idler field ( idler `` carrier '' and sidebands ) can finally be isolated , and its power measured with an optical power meter ( i.e. low - speed photodetector ) to be : @xmath11 for some constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "this expression clearly shows that once the system has been characterized , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath5 are known , an optical power meter can be used to estimate the unknown rf frequency @xmath2 , without the need for expensive high - speed rf equipment .",
    "an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : idler_power ] ) reveals the inherent trade - off between measurement bandwidth ( @xmath16 ) , and measurement sensitivity , defined as @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . to bypass this trade - off and maximize measurement sensitivity without compromising bandwidth , it is necessary to maximize the idler power , both to operate further above the noise floor , and to increase the slope of eq .",
    "( [ eq : idler_power ] ) .",
    "it is then crucial to harness fwm in a low - loss , nonlinear platform .    :",
    "tunable delay element ; bpf : optical bandpass filter .",
    "( b ) degenerate ( dfwm ) and non - degenerate ( ndfwm ) mixing processes between the two channels . ]",
    "in this work , the nonlinear platform used to harness the fwm was a 35 cm long silicon strip waveguide @xcite .",
    "silicon is a highly attractive platform for nonlinear optics partly due its large kerr coefficient ( 100 times larger than that of silica ) , and due to its compatibility with cmos processes @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of this waveguide was its large mode area of 2.7 @xmath19m@xmath20 , combined with a small footprint .",
    "ordinarily , waveguides with such large mode areas required mm or even cm - scale bending radii , due to high mode coupling losses , and were thus constrained to lengths of a few centimeters @xcite .",
    "this particular sample however used euler bends , where the bending radius continuously varies along the whole bend , ensuring minimum coupling to higher order modes @xcite .",
    "this resulted in @xmath19m - scale bending radii , comparable to that of nanowires .",
    "consequently , the whole 35 cm long spiral , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_spiral](a ) , occupied less than 3 mm@xmath20 surface area on an silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) chip .",

    "( c ) rib - to - strip converter for coupling to the fundamental mode . ]",
    "the dimensions of the strip cross section were 3@xmath211.875 @xmath19 m .",
    "there are several advantages that follow from this large size : low 0.15 db / cm linear propagation loss ( compared to 1 - 3 db / cm for silicon nanowires ) , a higher nonlinear loss threshold , and efficient coupling to lensed fibers ( 1.5 db / facet coupling losses ) .",
    "the coupling was done into a single - mode rib waveguide which then tapered into the strip waveguide , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_spiral](c ) , ensuring excitation of the fundamental mode .",
    "the waveguide dispersion at 1550 nm was normal , which led to a fwm 3-db bandwidth of 6 nm .",
    "this is sufficient for most rf photonic applications , where the signal content is in the range of 1 - 100 ghz , or less than 2 nm .",
    "the nonlinear optical properties of the waveguide were measured through a series of self - phase modulation ( spm ) and fwm experiments . by launching picosecond pulses into the waveguide , we observed spm broadening and were able to estimate the kerr coefficient as @xmath22 m@xmath20w@xmath23 .",
    "this value was slightly lower than for a typical silicon waveguide , possibly due to the change in crystal orientation that occurs in the spiral bends @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear parameter was then estimated as @xmath24 1.8 m@xmath23w@xmath23 .",
    "we note that the maximum fwm conversion efficiency for this waveguide was comparable to that obtainable using a much shorter 5 mm standard silicon nanowire .",
    "however , our thick silicon spiral was not optimized for fwm .",
    "more importantly , the low coupling losses meant that the total waveguide insertion loss was lower than for a nanowire .",
    "this property is central to ifm applications , where the output idler power has a direct effect on the system performance .",
    "the experimental setup was based on the structure shown in fig . [",
    "fig_principle](a ) .",
    "two semiconductor laser diodes were used to generate the optical carriers , with wavelengths of 1550.0 and 1551.7 nm .",
    "the electro - optic modulator ( eom ) used was a mach - zehnder modulator , while the @xmath5 delay was adjusted using a tunable optical delay line .",
    "figure [ fig_osa ] shows the optical spectrum at the output of the silicon spiral , when the microwave input frequency is @xmath25 ghz . by adjusting the tunable delay line",
    ", we were able to vary the product @xmath26 between 0 and @xmath27 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : idler_power ] ) , these two points corresponded to maximum and minimum idler sidebands power , respectively .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig_osa ] , where there is a 10 db power contrast for the idler sidebands as the delay is tuned .     values .",
    "the 10 db power difference between the idler sidebands is a manifestation of the interference effect between the idlers generated through dfwm and ndfwm . ]",

    "( b ) frequency estimation measurement over a single 40 ghz frequency band ( inset : histogram of the frequency measurement error , rms value = 318.9 mhz).,title=\"fig : \" ]    initially , the time delay between the optical signals was set to 8.3 ps .",
    "both optical carriers entered the waveguide with 18.7 dbm power , which resulted in a fwm conversion efficiency of @xmath2830.1 db , here defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the ifm system was then characterized by sweeping an rf signal generator from 0 to 40 ghz , and measuring the generated idler power .",
    "this measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_long](a ) , together with a theoretical fit .",
    "the fit was then used to estimate unknown frequencies in the measurement range , and the results are shown in fig . [ fig_long](b ) .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) of the frequency estimation error was 318.9 mhz , which corresponded to 0.8% of the 40 ghz measurement bandwidth .",
    "this combination of wide measurement bandwidth ( limited only by the range of the rf signal generator ) , and sub-1% error , is a record for an imwp ifm system .    ) and low bandwidth / error state ( high @xmath5 ) . ]    as explained in section 2 , increasing the @xmath5 delay can lead to enhanced measurement sensitivity ( i.e. lower error ) , at the cost of a reduced measurement bandwidth . this trade - off",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconfiguration ] where , as @xmath5 is increased , a given idler power measurement no longer maps to a single rf frequency band , but to multiple , narrower bands .",
    "nevertheless , by rapidly reconfiguring @xmath5 , it is possible to exploit the high accuracy of a high-@xmath5 measurement , combined with the wide bandwidth of a low-@xmath5 measurement .",
    "this is a process consisting of two steps .",
    "initially , a small @xmath5 is chosen to obtain a rough estimate of the frequency band in which the rf signal resides ( e.g. band 4 in fig . [ fig_reconfiguration ] ) . following this ,",
    "@xmath5 is increased , producing a highly accurate , unambiguous estimate of the signal frequency .    to demonstrate this process , we reconfigured the system by increasing the time delay to 69.4 ps .",
    "the system characterization and theoretical fit are shown in fig . [ fig_short](a ) .",
    "the decaying sinusoid response is due to the frequency roll - off of the modulator .",
    "each linear region of the system response was then assigned to a particular frequency band .",
    "this resulted in six , 7.2 ghz bands , which were then used to estimate the frequency of various rf tones .",
    "the result of this measurement , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_short](b ) , exhibits a low estimation error , with rms value of 40.2 mhz , or 0.56% of the 7.2 ghz measurement bandwidth .",

    "( b ) frequency estimation measurement for six separate 7.2 ghz frequency bands ( inset : histogram of the frequency measurement error , rms value = 40.2 mhz).,title=\"fig : \" ]    these measurements show a unique and important feature of fwm - based ifm : the ability to easily tune the system response to optimize for bandwidth or sensitivity .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to be able to quickly tune the @xmath5 delay , so as to perform fast consecutive measurements with wide bandwidth and high accuracy .",
    "our technique for implementing the delay constitutes a significant improvement over that used in previous fwm - based ifm @xcite , where a dispersive element introduced a delay between the two channels .",
    "this is because a tunable delay line offers a much faster mechanism for tuning @xmath5 , compared to tuning a laser wavelength .",
    "furthermore , a recent breakthrough in setting tunable time delay has achieved sub - nanosecond settling time @xcite .",
    "this opens the way to achieving the first ifm system which overcomes the bandwidth / error trade - off through sub - nanosecond reconfiguration .",
    "the ability to harness nonlinear optical processes efficiently , in a low - loss integrated platform , is fundamental for a wide variety of microwave photonic applications @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true of fwm - based ifm where , as we have seen , the generated idler power has a direct effect on the measurement error . in this work",
    ", we have shown that long , thick silicon waveguides exhibit all of these properties , while being able to maintain low footprints and a high nonlinear loss threshold .",
    "nevertheless , to be able to monolithically integrate all critical components of the ifm system , one will need to combine the thick silicon platform with a more standard soi technology .",
    "one such technology is 220 nm thin soi , which enables access to a full library of active and passive components .",
    "our vision of the layout of a future fully - integrated soi fwm - based ifm system is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_future ] , featuring a single transition from thin to thick silicon .",
    "this transition could be implemented using a section of tapered rib waveguide that minimizes the excitation of higher order modes @xcite , or even through photonic wire bonding @xcite .",
    "is achieved by varying the voltage input to the phase modulator .",
    "the photodetector outputs a dc voltage proportional to the idler power , which is then mapped to an estimate for the rf input signal frequency . ]    the thick silicon part of the chip houses the fwm waveguide , bpf , and photodetector .",
    "one of the main advantages of the current fwm - based ifm scheme is that it requires only a simple low - speed photodetector .",
    "such a device has already been demonstrated using vertical p - i - n germanium , integrated on a thick soi waveguide @xcite .",
    "bandpass filters composed of cascaded mach - zehnder interferometers have also been demonstrated in thick silicon @xcite .",
    "for these components , euler bends will need to be implemented so as to maintain a low footprint .    the thin silicon section of the chip hosts the electro - optic modulators , and arrayed waveguide grating .",
    "the intensity modulator used by the input rf signal would be implemented using doped thin soi technology .",
    "such mach - zehnder modulators have been shown capable of high performance , with low 1.6 db insertion loss , and wide 27.8 ghz bandwidth @xcite .",
    "demultiplexing of the two channels would occur in an arrayed waveguide grating , which have also been demonstrated in thin soi with 200 ghz channel spacing @xcite .",

    "high - speed phase modulators have been implemented using silicon - organic hybrid ( soh ) technology @xcite , and would allow for fast tuning of the @xmath5 delay .",
    "such a chip , boasting fast tunable delay and compact size will result in the first ultra - low latency and highly accurate ifm system with bandwidth and capabilities beyond what is achievable using state - of - the - art rf technologies .",
    "we have presented the first ifm system using on - chip fwm , capable of extremely high frequency measurements , and low error through easy reconfiguration of the system response .",
