    "in this talk , we introduce a new work@xcite on the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea as arising from the pure statistical effect without any parameter .",
    "it will be shown that we can reproduce the flavor asymmetry @xmath1 , which is in surprisingly agreement with the experimental observation , by just using the principle of detailed balance .",
    "we take the proton as an ensemble of a complete set of quark - gluon fock states , and these different fock states can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the valence quarks of the proton , @xmath4 is the number of quark - antiquark @xmath5 pairs , @xmath6 is the number of quark - antiquark @xmath7 pairs , and @xmath8 is the number of gluons .",
    "then the density operator of the ensemble is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability of finding a proton in the state @xmath11 and should satisfy the normalization condition , @xmath12 it will be shown that @xmath10 can be calculated by using the principle of detailed balance without any parameter .",
    "given an ensemble of quark - gluon fock states that has @xmath13 of finding proton in state a and @xmath14 of finding proton in state b , then the states may change between each others from time to time .",
    "the principle of detailed balance means that the changing between any two states balance each other .",
    "so during a period of time , the number of events that changed from state a to state b ( @xmath15 ) equals the number of events that changed from state b to state a ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 @xmath18 is proportional to both @xmath19 and the transition probability of a to b ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 we considered about b to a in the same way , @xmath22 then combining ( [ detailed balance ] ) , ( [ a - b ] ) and ( [ b - a ] ) , we have @xmath23 in order to know @xmath10 , transition probabilities should be calculated out first .        in the recombination process that involving two kinds of partons , the transition probability is proportional to both the number of those two kinds of partons that may recombine in a certain state , @xmath25        \\(1 ) in the translation process involving the creation or annihilation of gluon , only @xmath28 will be considered while @xmath26 neglected .",
    "so we have @xmath29 using formula ( [ ratio ] ) , we obtain a recursion formula , @xmath30 we can further get a more general formula , @xmath31 and we have @xmath32 , which we will used later .",
    "\\(2 ) in the translation process involving the creation or annihilation of a pair of @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 using formula ( [ ratio ] ) , we obtain a recursion formula , @xmath35 using relation @xmath32 , we get @xmath36    \\(3 ) in the translation process involving the creation or annihilation of a pair of @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 using formula ( [ ratio ] ) , we obtain a recursion formula , @xmath39 using relation @xmath32 , we get @xmath40 combining ( [ g - gg ] ) , ( [ g - uu ] ) , and ( [ g - dd ] ) , we obtain the general formula @xmath41 from this result and the normalization condition ( [ unit ] ) , all @xmath10 can be calculated out as shown in table 1 . from table 1 , we get the numbers of intrinsic gluons and sea quarks of the proton , @xmath42    the flavor sea - quark asymmetry @xmath43 can be checked by experiments directly because its @xmath44 dependence is small .",
    "it is a surprise that our result is in excellent agreement with the recent experimental result @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this good agreement indicates that the principle of detailed balance plays an essential role in the structure of proton .",
    "we also give a complete set of fock states for the proton , with the probability of finding each fock state calculated without any parameter , as shown in table  1 .",
