    "inhomogeneous self - similar sets were introduced by barnsley and demko @xcite as a natural generalisation of the standard iterated function system construction . as well as being interesting from a structural and geometric point of view , these sets have useful applications in image compression .",
    "the dimension theory of inhomogeneous self - similar sets was investigated by olsen and snigireva @xcite and later by fraser @xcite , revealing many subtle differences between the inhomogeneous attractors and their homogeneous counterparts . up until now",
    ", this investigation has only been concerned with self - similar constructions , where the arguments are considerably simplified because the scaling properties are very well understood . in particular , as one zooms into the set , one sees the same picture as one started with , even in the inhomogeneous case . in this paper",
    "we take on the more challenging problem of studying inhomogeneous self - affine sets , and , in particular , inhomogeneous versions of the self - affine carpets considered by bedford - mcmullen @xcite , lalley - gatzouras @xcite and baraski @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous iterated function systems are generalisations of standard iterated function systems ( ifss ) , which are one of the most important methods for constructing fractal sets .",
    "indeed , one might call the attractors of the standard systems _ homogeneous attractors_. let @xmath0 be a compact metric space .",
    "an ifs is a finite collection @xmath1 of contracting self - maps on @xmath2 .",
    "it is a fundamental result in fractal geometry , dating back to hutchinson s seminal 1981 paper @xcite , that for every ifs there exists a unique non - empty compact set @xmath3 , called the _ attractor _ , which satisfies @xmath4",
    "this can be proved by an elegant application of banach s contraction mapping theorem .",
    "if an ifs consists solely of _ similarity _ transformations , then the attractor is called a _ self - similar set_. likewise , if @xmath2 is a euclidean space and the mappings are all translate linear ( _ affine _ ) transformations , then the attractor is called _ self - affine_. +   + more generally , given a compact set @xmath5 , called the _ condensation set _ , analogous to the homogeneous case , there is a unique non - empty compact set @xmath6 satisfying @xmath7 which we refer to as the _ inhomogeneous _ attractor ( with condensation @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that homogeneous attractors are inhomogeneous attractors with condensation equal to the empty set . from now on we will assume that the condensation set is non - empty .",
    "inhomogeneous attractors were introduced and studied in @xcite and are also discussed in detail in @xcite where , among other things , barnsley gives applications of these schemes to image compression , see figure 1 .",
    "inhomogeneous attractors also have interesting applications in the realm of dimension theory and fractals : in certain cases homogeneous attractors with complicated overlaps can be viewed as inhomogeneous attractors without overlaps , making them considerably easier to study . see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the set of all finite sequences with entries in @xmath10 and for @xmath11 write @xmath12 the _ orbital set _",
    ", @xmath13 was introduced in @xcite and it turns out that this set plays an important role in the structure of inhomogeneous attractors .",
    "in particular , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the _ homogeneous _ attractor of the ifs . the relationship ( [ structure ] ) was proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.9 ) in the case where @xmath2 is a compact subset of @xmath16 and the maps are similarities .",
    "we note here that their arguments easily generalise to obtain the general case stated above . when considering the dimension @xmath17 of @xmath6 , one expects the relationship @xmath18 to hold . indeed , if @xmath17 is countably stable , monotone and does not increase under lipschitz maps , then    @xmath19    and so the formula holds trivially .",
    "thus , studying the hausdorff and packing dimensions of inhomogeneous attractors is equivalent to studying the hausdorff and packing dimensions of the corresponding homogeneous attractor , and thus is not an interesting problem in its own right .",
    "however , the upper and lower box dimensions are not countably stable and so computing these dimensions in the inhomogeneous case is interesting and ( perhaps ) challenging , although one may still expect , somewhat navely , that the relationship ( [ inhomexpected ] ) should hold for these dimensions .",
    "recall that the lower and upper box dimensions of a bounded set @xmath20 are defined by @xmath21 respectively , where @xmath22 is the smallest number of sets required for a @xmath23-cover of @xmath3 . if @xmath24 , then we call the common value the box dimension of @xmath3 and denote it by @xmath25 .",
    "it is useful to note that we can replace @xmath26 with a myriad of different definitions all based on covering or packing the set at scale @xmath23 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) .",
    "+   + the upper box dimensions of inhomogeneous self - similar sets were studied by olsen and snigireva @xcite where they proved that the expected relationship ( [ inhomexpected ] ) is satisfied for upper box dimension assuming some strong separation conditions .",
    "this result was then generalised by fraser @xcite , where he proved the following bounds without assuming any separation conditions . for any inhomogeneous self - similar set @xmath6",
    ", we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the _ similarity dimension _ of @xmath15 .",
    "this shows that ( [ inhomexpected ] ) is satisfied for upper box dimension provided the box dimension of the homogeneous attractor is given by the similarity dimension - which occurs if the ifs satisfies the open set condition ( osc ) , for example .",
    "the second main result in @xcite was that ( [ inhomexpected ] ) is in general _ not _",
    "satisfied for _ lower _ box dimension .",
    "it is evident in @xcite that proving upper bounds for the lower box dimension of an inhomogeneous attractor in general is a difficult problem . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath29 oscillates wildly as @xmath30 , then estimating @xmath31 is tricky because it involves covering @xmath8 at many different scales .",
    "_ covering regularity exponents _",
    "were introduced to try to tackle this problem , but yielded only upper and lower estimates .",
    "self - affine carpets are an important and well - studied class of fractal set .",
    "this line of research began with the bedford - mcmullen carpets , introduced in the mid 80s @xcite and has blossomed into a vast and wide ranging field .",
    "particular attention has been paid to computing the dimensions of an array of different classes of self - affine carpets , see @xcite .",
    "one reason that these classes are of interest is that they provide examples of self - affine sets with distinct hausdorff and packing dimensions . in this paper",
    "we will study inhomogeneous versions of the classes introduced by lalley and gatzouras in 1992 and baraski in 2007 , and so we briefly recall these constructions and fix some notation .",
    "both classes consist of self - affine attractors of finite contractive iterated function systems acting on the unit square .",
    "+   + * lalley - gatzouras carpets : * take the unit square and divide it up into columns via a finite positive number of vertical lines . now divide each column up independently by slicing horizontally . finally select a subset of the small rectangles , with the only restriction being that the length of the base must be greater than or equal to the height , and for each chosen subrectangle include a map in the ifs which maps the unit square onto the rectangle via an orientation preserving linear contraction and a translation .",
    "the hausdorff and box dimensions of the attractors of such systems were computed in @xcite .",
    "we note that in @xcite it was assumed that every map was strictly self - affine , i.e. that the length of the base of each rectangle must be strictly greater than the height .",
    "we do not assume this here .",
    "* baraski carpets : * again take the unit square , but this time divide it up into a collection of subrectangles by slicing horizontally and vertically a finite number of times ( at least once in each direction ) .",
    "now take a subset of the subrectangles formed and form an ifs as above , choosing at least one rectangle with the horizontal side strictly longer than the vertical side and one with the vertical side strictly longer than the horizontal side .",
    "the reason we assume this is so that the baranki class is disjoint from the lalley - gatzouras class .",
    "of course , if all the rectangles have longer vertical side , the ifs is equivalent to a lalley - gatzouras system via rotation by 90 degrees and so we omit discussion of this situation .",
    "the key difference between the two classes is that in the baraski class one does not have that the strongest contraction is always in the vertical direction and this makes the baraski class significantly more difficult to deal with .",
    "the hausdorff and box dimensions of the attractors of such systems were computed in @xcite .        more general classes , containing both of the above , have been introduced and studied by feng and wang @xcite and fraser @xcite .",
    "see also the recent survey paper @xcite which discusses the development of the study of self - affine carpets in the context of more general self - affine sets .",
    "+   + we will say that a set is an inhomogeneous self - affine carpet if @xmath15 is a self - affine carpet in the lalley - gatzouras or baraski class . in order to state our results , we need to introduce some notation . throughout this section",

    "the maps @xmath35 in the ifs will be translate linear orientation preserving contractions on @xmath36 ^ 2 $ ] of the form @xmath37 for some contraction constants @xmath38 in the horizontal direction and @xmath39 in the vertical direction and a translation @xmath40 .",
    "in this section we state our results .",
    "let @xmath32 be an ifs described in section [ affinecarpets ] and fix a compact condensation set @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "as in the dimension theory of homogeneous self - affine carpets , the dimensions of orthogonal projections play an important role .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the orthogonal projections from the plane onto the first and second coordinates respectively and write @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 note that @xmath49 and @xmath50 exist because they are the box dimensions of self - similar sets , whereas the equalities @xmath51 and @xmath52 may not hold , even if the box dimension of @xmath8 exists .",
    "finally , let @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , be the unique solutions of @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "if @xmath61 or @xmath62 , then write @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively for the common values .",
    "we need to make the following assumption to obtain a sharp formula for the upper box dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , this assumption concerns the assouad dimension @xmath65 of projections of @xmath8 .",
    "this dimension is similar to upper box dimension , but is much more sensitive to local properties .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath66    see the papers @xcite for more details .",
    "the assouad dimensions of homogeneous self - affine carpets were computed in @xcite .",
    "+   + * assumption ( a ) * : @xmath67 , for @xmath68 .",

    "if @xmath6 is lalley - gatzouras , then @xmath69 if @xmath6 is baraski , then @xmath70 furthermore , if we do not assume ( a ) , then the same results are true but with the final equalities replaced by `` @xmath71 '' , i.e. we do not obtain an upper bound for @xmath72",
    ".    we will prove theorem [ main4 ] in section [ mainproof4 ] .",
    "it is regrettable that we need to assume ( a ) to obtain a precise result but in a certain sense it is not important , because the highlight of this paper is the demonstration that the expected relationship ( [ inhomexpected ] ) can fail for inhomogeneous carpets and , since we only need assumption ( a ) for the _ upper bound _ , this does not change the situations where we can demonstrate this failure .",
    "also , we note that without assumption ( a ) our methods would yield an upper bound for @xmath73 where we use the assouad dimensions of projections instead of upper box dimensions in the definition of @xmath54 and @xmath56 , but we omit further discussion of this .",
    "indeed , it was our initial belief that ( a ) was not required at all and in fact theorem [ main4 ] remains true without it , but surprisingly this is not the case . in section [ example2 ] we prove this by example .",
    "+   + notice that we obtain a precise formula for the upper box dimension , but only lower bounds for the lower box dimension . as discussed above ,",
    "computing upper bounds for lower box dimension is difficult , even in the simpler setting of self - similar sets . to obtain better estimates here , one could analyse the behaviour of the oscillations of the function @xmath74 using covering regularity exponents which were introduced in @xcite for example , but we do not pursue this and instead focus more on the upper box dimension and , in particular , the fact that the relationship ( [ inhomexpected ] ) can fail .",
    "the following corollaries are immediate and include some simple sufficient conditions for the relationship ( [ inhomexpected ] ) to hold , or not hold .",
    "suppose the box dimensions of @xmath8 and the orthogonal projections of @xmath8 exist and assume ( a ) .",

    "corollary [ inhomfailscor ] is the most interesting as it gives simple , and easily constructible , conditions for the relationship ( [ inhomexpected ] ) to fail .",
    "we will construct such an example in section [ combs ] .",
    "+   + although the underlying homogeneous ifss automatically satisfy the osc , it is worth remarking that our results impose no further separation conditions concerning the condensation set @xmath8 . in particular",

    "+   + it would be interesting to extend the results in this case to the more general carpets introduced by feng and wang @xcite or fraser @xcite",

    "* question 2.4 ) .",
    "in particular , the sets @xmath90 and @xmath91 are inhomogeneous self - similar sets and knowledge of their dimension is crucial in the subsequent proofs .",

    "there is certainly scope for future research here , and it is easily seen that our methods give solutions to the more general problem in certain cases and can always provide non - trivial estimates ; however , we omit further discussion .",
    "we give a construction of an inhomogeneous bedford - mcmullen carpet , which we refer to as an _ inhomogeneous fractal comb _ which exhibits some interesting properties .",
    "the underlying homogeneous ifs will be a bedford - mcmullen construction where the unit square has been divided into 2 columns of width @xmath92 , and @xmath93 rows of height @xmath94 .",

    "there the authors prove that for all @xmath202 any lalley - gatzouras or baraski system , @xmath243 , has a finite subsystem @xmath244 ( for some @xmath245 ) , with the following properties : @xmath246 consists only of maps with linear part of the form @xmath247 for some constants @xmath248 depending on @xmath199 ; the hausdorff dimension of the attractor of @xmath246 is no more than @xmath199 smaller than the hausdorff dimension of the attractor of @xmath243 ; and @xmath246 has uniform fibers ( either vertical or horizontal , depending on the relative size of @xmath249 and @xmath250 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that one can not approximate the box and packing dimensions ` from within ' in the same way . to see this",
    "observe that in the uniform fibers case the hausdorff , box and packing dimensions coincide . as such",
    "if these dimensions did not coincide in the original construction , then one can not find subsystems for which they coincide but get arbitrarily close to the box dimension .",
    "it is natural to ask if one can do this if the uniform fibers condition is dropped .",
    "we have been unable to show this and it seems that the problem is somehow linked to the fact that the packing dimension does not behave well with respect to fixing prescribed frequencies of maps in the ifs . for examples of such bad behaviour , we note that for bedford - mcmullen carpets there does not usually exist a bernoulli measure with full packing dimension and the packing spectrum of bernoulli measures supported on self - affine carpets need not peak at the ambient packing dimension ( thomas jordan , personal communication ) .",
    "in contrast to this , there is always a bernoulli measure with full hausdorff dimension and the hausdorff spectrum always peaks at the ambient hausdorff dimension , @xcite . also , see the related work of nielsen @xcite on subsets of carpets consisting of points where the digits in the expansions occur with prescribed frequencies . fortunately , for the purposes of this chapter",
    ", we do not need to approximate the box dimension from within , but rather approximate the quantities @xmath54 and @xmath56 , which we _ can _ do .",
    "[ fromwithin ] let @xmath6 be an inhomogeneous self - affine carpet in the lalley - gatzouras or baraski class and assume that @xmath251 .",
    "then for all @xmath202 , there exists a finite subsystem @xmath252 for some @xmath253 and @xmath245 , with the property that for all @xmath254 we have @xmath255 , @xmath256 for some constants @xmath248 depending on @xmath199 ; and the number @xmath54 defined by @xmath257 is no more than @xmath199 smaller than the number @xmath54 defined by @xmath10 .",
    "we will use a version of stirling s approximation for the logarithm of large factorials .",
    "this states that for all @xmath258 we have @xmath259 for @xmath228 , let @xmath260 and for @xmath233 , let @xmath261 and note that @xmath262 . consider the @xmath263th iteration of @xmath10 and let @xmath264 it is straightforward to see that @xmath265 and for each @xmath266 we have @xmath267 and @xmath268 indeed , these facts were observed in @xcite",
    "we can now use this information to estimate the number @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath269 , which we will denote by @xmath270 to differentiate it from the number @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath10 , which we will denote by @xmath271 . since @xmath269 is a subsystem of @xmath10 and since @xmath251 , it follows by definition that @xmath272 as @xmath273 .",
    "it follows that for any @xmath202 , we can choose @xmath235 large enough to ensure that the ifs @xmath274 satisfies the properties required by @xmath246 , which completes the proof .",

    "writing @xmath280 for the attractor of the ifs corresponding to @xmath257 , it follows from proposition [ bedmcprop ] that @xmath281 and letting @xmath199 tend to zero completes the proof .",
