    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are generally characterized by sporadic and short ( @xmath0 ) bursts of hard x - rays with luminosities as high as @xmath1 eddington luminosity .",
    "they are also well - know for two giant flares : the first on 1979 march 5 from sgr 0526 - 66 ( mazets et al .",
    "1979 ) and the second on 1998 august 27 from sgr 1900 + 14 ( hurley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported , following the giant august 1998 flare from sgr 1900 + 14 , the detection of a transient radio source .",
    "their observations covered the time from about one week to one month after the flare .",
    "the spectrum between 1 and 10 ghz is well fitted by a power - law with @xmath2 . the source appears to have peaked at about a week after the burst and subsequently undergone a power law decay with an exponent of @xmath3 .",
    "the initial hard spike of the august 27 flare has a duration of @xmath4 and luminosity greater than @xmath5 ( @xmath615kev ) if the source distance is @xmath7 ( vasisht et al .",
    "the short duration , high luminosity and hard spectrum indicate that a relativistically expanding fireball was driven from the star .",
    "the fireball should be relatively clean and the lorentz factor @xmath8 was inferred from the luminosity and the temporal structure ( thompson & duncan 2001 ) . with the experience of grb afterglows , one may naturally ask whether this power - law fading radio afterglow is due to the blast wave emission driven by the fireball .",
    "huang , dai & lu ( 1998 ) and eichler ( 2003 ) had made some discussions on the possible afterglow emission from sgrs . in this paper , we try to explain the radio afterglow from this flare .",
    "we study the afterglow emission from the giant flare in section 2 .",
    "we find that shock emission from an ultra - relativistic outflow fails to explain this radio afterglow .",
    "however , we propose that a mildly or sub - relativistic outflow expanding into the interstellar medium could fit the observations . finally , we discuss the possible origin for this kind of outflow in section 3 .",
    "we consider that an outflow with  isotropic \" kinetic energy @xmath9 and lorentz factor @xmath10 ejected from the sgr expands into the ambient medium with a constant number density @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction between the outflow and the surrounding medium is analogous to grb external shock ( rees & mszros 1992 ; mszros & rees 1997 ) , but with quite different @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the sedov time at which the shock enters the non - relativistic phase is roughly given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the proton mass and we used the usual notation @xmath14 . as the shock must have entered the non - relativistic phase during the observation time of the radio afterglow from the giant flare , we develop a model which holds for both the relativistic and non - relativistic phases . from the view of the energy conservation",
    ", the dynamic equation can be approximately simplified as ( e.g. huang , dai & lu 1999 ; wang , dai & lu 2003 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lorentz factors of the outflow , @xmath17 is the mass of the swept - up ism ( @xmath18 is the shock radius ) and @xmath19 is the mass of the original outflow . the first term on the left of the equation is the kinetic energy of the outflow and the second term is the internal energy of the shock .    the kinematic equation of the ejecta is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bulk velocity of the outflow with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the observer time . if the outflow is beamed and sideways expansion with sound speed takes place , the expression of @xmath24 and the half opening angle of the beamed outflow @xmath25 are respectively given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the sound speed and we use the approximate expression derived by huang , dai & lu ( 2000 ) , which holds for both the ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic limits .    assuming that the distribution of the shock - accelerated electrons takes a power - law form with the number density given by @xmath28 for @xmath29 , the volume emissivity at the frequency @xmath30 in the comoving frame of the shocked gas is ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the charge and mass of the electron , @xmath34 is the strength of the component of magnetic field perpendicular to the electron velocity , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the characteristic frequencies for electrons with @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , and @xmath39 with @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the bessel function ) .",
    "the physical quantities in the pre - shock and post - shock ism are connected by the jump conditions ( blandford & mckee 1976):@xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the energy and the number densities of the shocked gas in its comoving frame and @xmath46 is the adiabatic index , a simple interpolation of which between ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic limits , @xmath47 , gives a valid approximation for trans - relativistic shocks .",
    "assuming that shocked electrons and the magnetic field acquire constant fractions ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) of the total shock energy , we get @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . from the spectrum @xmath54 of the radio afterglow , we infer that @xmath55 .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that @xmath36 , in comparison with the radio frequencies , is very large throughout the observations .",
    "the observer frequency @xmath56 relates to the frequency @xmath30 in the comoving frame by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the doppler factor .",
    "the observed flux density at @xmath56 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the effective volume of the post - shock ism from which the radiation is received by the observer and should be @xmath61 for the isotropic case .",
    "below we shall study the afterglows from the relativistic outflow with @xmath62 and the mildly - relativistic one respectively .       in terms of eqs(1)-(3 ) , we can obtain the dynamic evolution of the outflow , i.e. we get @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "then using eq.(4 ) and the expressions for @xmath34 , @xmath67 and @xmath37 , we can get the evolution of the observed flux with time .",
    "the radio afterglow of august 1998 flare peaks at about one week after the burst . in the relativistic shock model",
    ", it requires that the peak frequency @xmath68 crosses the observation band at the peak time if the synchrotron radiation is optically thin .",
    "however , this can hardly be satisfied for a ultra - relativistic outflow with @xmath62 , for reasonable values of the shock parameters and the medium density @xmath11 . instead",
    ", the model light curves generally peak at @xmath69 .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig . 1",
    ", in which we plot the model light curves with different values of @xmath11 and @xmath49 for both the isotropic and beamed outflow cases and compare them with the observation data .",
    "moreover , the peak flux @xmath70 are generally much larger than the observed peak flux .",
    "the reason can be easily understood from the following analytic estimate for the isotropic outflow case .    at the peak time @xmath71 of the radio afterglow",
    ", the shock had entered the non - relativistic phase , so the radius of the shock is roughly @xmath72 . from the condition of energy conservation @xmath73",
    ", one can get @xmath74 .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath75 and the peak frequency and the peak flux are , respectively , given by @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the total number of the swept - up electrons and @xmath79 is the peak spectral power ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath68 can hardly be as large as @xmath80 for reasonable shock parameters of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( e.g. granot , piran & sari 1999 ; wijers & galama 1999 ; panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) and , furthermore , the peak flux is much larger than detected from the giant flare . though this analytic estimate is for an isotropic outflow case , the beamed outflow has also this problem as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "although the ultra - relativistic shock associated with the initial hard spike of the giant flare could not be responsible for the observed radio afterglow , we know from fig .",
    "1 that its radio afterglow emission should be easily detected at the early time even for the beamed case .",
    "the optical afterglow emission from the ultra - relativistic shock is also calculated and shown in fig.2 .",
    "clearly , early optical afterglow emission can be as bright as @xmath81 ( r band magnitude @xmath82 ) at @xmath83 for @xmath84 , a reasonable value we know from grb afterglows .",
    "so we urge early follow - up radio - to - optical observations for future sgr giant flares to test the presence of ultra - relativistic outflows . even at late time",
    "@xmath85 days , the flux at low radio frequencies are intense enough to be detected . at , say,@xmath86",
    ", the extrapolated flux is @xmath87 from eqs(7 ) and ( 8) for the typical parameters",
    "used.hz at this time . ]",
    "the x - ray afterglow emission from the ultra - relativistic shock is , however , predicted to be lower than the detected bright and pulsed x - ray afterglow flux ( feroci et al . 2001 ) , which is attributed to the emission from the neutron star surface immediately after the giant flare .      in  2.1",
    ", we showed that the radio afterglow from the 1998 august giant flare of sgr1900 + 14 is inconsistent with the shock emission from an ultra - relativistic outflow .",
    "but a mildly or sub - relativistic forward shock is able to explain the observations , as we show below .",
    "the reason is that for a mildly - relativistic or sub - relativistic outflow , it has an enough long period of coasting phase of the outflow , during which the flux increases with time even though @xmath88 .",
    "after this coasting phase , the shock decelerates and the flux begins to fade in a power law manner . for an isotropic outflow , the coasting phase lasts about @xmath89 until the mass of the ism swept up by the blast wave is comparable to the mass of the outflow , where @xmath90 is the initial velocity of the outflow . during the coast phase , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . according to eqs.(4 ) and ( 6 ) , @xmath93 .",
    "when the mildly or sub - relativistic outflow is decelerated by the swept - up mass , it quickly enters the sedov phase , during which @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "so , @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "for a beamed outflow , the coasting phase is similar to the isotropic case , as the expansion is dominated by the cold ejecta during this phase .",
    "but during the deceleration phase , the shocked ism plasma has comparable energy to initial energy @xmath9 and the sideways expansion may take place , so it is expected that the flux may decay steeper than the isotropic case ( e.g. rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .    the fits with model",
    "light curves for mildly or sub - relativistic outflow are presented in figs .",
    "3 and 4 for different shock parameters . in fig.3 ,",
    "the isotropic energy is chosen to be @xmath98 while in fig 4 the real energy of the ejecta is chosen to be @xmath99 ( its isotropic energy is therefore @xmath100 , where@xmath101 is the initial half opening angle ) .",
    "the beamed outflow model can provide nice fits of the observations for a wide range of shock parameters such as @xmath11 and @xmath9 . in fig.3 , we also present the model light curve for an isotropic outflow ( without sideways expansion ) denoted with the dashed line .",
    "clearly , it decays too slowly to fit the observations .",
    "in all these fits , we used fixed values for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath101 , @xmath48 and @xmath11 with only two free parameters : the initial lorentz factor @xmath10 and @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the mildly or sub - relativistic outflow from the sgr giant flare could provide a plausible explanation for this radio afterglow .",
    "we have shown that a mildly or sub - relativistic outflow from the sgr could be consistent with this radio afterglow .",
    "this outflow is expected to originate from the neutron star curst , accompanying the giant flare .",
    "sgrs are now believed to be `` magnetars '' , neutron stars with surface field of order @xmath104 gauss or more ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ) . the energy that drives the very large ( @xmath105 ) giant flares such as the march 5 , 1979 event from sgr 0526 - 66 and the august 27 , 1998 event from sgr 1900 + 14 is attributed to a sudden large - scale rearrangement of the magnetic field which releases the magnetic energy , while the smaller short repeating bursts ( @xmath106 ) seem to be well explained as being driven by the localized yield of the crust to the magnetic strain .",
    "a magnetic field with @xmath107 can fracture the curst , where @xmath108 is the shear modulus of the curst and @xmath109 is the nuclear density and @xmath110 is the yield strain of the crust .",
    "however , such a patch of crust is too heavy to be able to overcome the binding energy of the neutron star .",
    "we expect that only a tiny fraction of the fracturing curst matter can overcome the gravitational binding energy and is able to be accelerated to a mildly - relativistic velocity @xmath111 by the released magnetic field energy .",
    "note that the kinetic energy of the mildly - relativistic matter per unit of mass @xmath112 is comparable to the binding energy @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath18 are the mass and radius of the neutron star respectively .",
    "let s denote the amount of matter as @xmath115 , the isotropic kinetic energy @xmath9 and the real energy of the beamed outflow @xmath116 , where @xmath101 is the beaming angle of this outflow . for @xmath111 , @xmath117 .",
    "let the size of this patch of matter be @xmath118 .",
    "because of the insensitivity of @xmath118 on @xmath115 for the outermost curst of neutron star , we estimate @xmath119 for @xmath120 .    once we know @xmath118 , we can estimate the beaming angle @xmath101 of the outflow when it breaks away from the confinement of the magnetic field .",
    "this amount of matter will be vaporized and become plasma near the neutron star surface , which moves out along the open field lines of the magnetar .",
    "the initial kinetic energy density of this outflow is @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the real kinetic energy luminosity of this outflow , @xmath123 is the initial velocity of this outflow and @xmath124 is the initial sectional area . as the plasma moves out to radial radius @xmath125 , the sectional area @xmath126 , where @xmath25 is the angle relative to the magnetic axis . because the magnetic field lines satisfy @xmath127 , @xmath128 for small @xmath25 and @xmath129 . on the other hand , the magnetic field energy density scales with @xmath125 as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the surface magnetic field of the neutron star . when the magnetic field energy density decreases to be comparable to the kinetic energy density , the outflow plasma breaks from the confinement of the magnetic field .",
    "this corresponds to a radius @xmath132 and @xmath133 . note that @xmath134 , which is roughly equal to the beaming angle @xmath101 , is very insensitive to the value of @xmath135 .",
    "as the initial opening angle near the neutron star surface @xmath136 , we estimate the beaming angle of the outflow is @xmath137 for typical parameters .    what powers the ejection of this patch of matter ?",
    "we think that the reconnection of the magnetic field within a region of size @xmath118 during the period of the giant flare will release energy of @xmath138 , which should be equal to @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the crust magnetic field , @xmath141 is the internal alfvn velocity and @xmath142 is the growth time of the instability causing the giant flare , viz .",
    "the duration ( @xmath143 ) of the initial hard spike of the august 27 giant flare(thompson & duncan 1995 , 2001 ) .",
    "the size is therefore estimated to be @xmath144 and the mass is @xmath145 , which are in reasonable agreement with the above estimates according to the light curve fits if @xmath146 or equally @xmath147 .      in summary",
    ", we studied the afterglow emission from the possible ultra - relativistic outflow and mildly or sub - relativistic outflow accompanying the sgr giant flares .",
    "the radio afterglow emission from the august 27 giant flare of sgr 1900 + 14 is consistent with a mildly or sub - relativistic outflow , but could not be produced by the forward shock emission from an ultra - relativistic outflow .",
    "however , we predict that this ultra - relativistic outflow , suggested to be associated with the hard spike of the giant flare , if exist , should produce bright radio to optical afterglows at the early phase ( @xmath148 , which can be tested by future observations",
