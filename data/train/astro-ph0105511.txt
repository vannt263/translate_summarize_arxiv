    "the scientific relevance of the small bodies in our solar system ranges from fundamental questions about their origins to pragmatic societal concerns about the frequency of asteroid impacts on the earth .",
    "a proper inventory of these objects requires a survey with    1 .   large sky coverage .",
    "2 .   faint limiting magnitude .",
    "3 .   uniform and well - defined detection limits in magnitude and proper motion .",
    "accurate multicolor photometry for taxonomy .",
    "5 .   sufficient multi - epoch observations or follow - up observations to determine the orbits of all , or at least of particularly interesting objects .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york _",
    "_ 2000 ) , which was primarily designed for studies of extragalactic objects , satisfies all of the above requirements , except the last one .",
    "although the sdss can not be used to determine the orbits of detected moving objects ( except in the special case of the kuiper belt objects discussed in  8) , its accurate and deep near simultaneous five - color photometry , ability to detect the motion of objects moving faster than 0.03 deg day@xmath9 , and large sky coverage , can be efficiently used for studying small solar system objects .",
    "for example , the largest multi - color asteroid survey to date is the eight color asteroid survey ( ecas , zellner , tholen & tedesco 1985 ) , in which 589 asteroids were observed in eight different passbands .",
    "the five - color sdss photometry spans roughly the same wavelength range as the ecas passbands , and will be available for about 100,000 asteroids to a limit about seven magnitudes fainter than ecas .",
    "this represents an increase in the number of observed objects with accurate multi - color photometry by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the only other survey with depth and number of observed objects comparable to sdss is spacewatch ii ( scotti , gehrels & rabinowitz 1991 ) , which , however , does not provide any color information .",
    "color information is vital in e.g. determining the asteroid size distribution , which is considered to be the `` planetary holy grail '' by jedicke & metcalfe ( 1998 ) , because the colors can be used to distinguish different types of asteroids and thus avoid significant ambiguities ( muiononen , bowell & lumme 1995 ) .",
    "for informative reviews of asteroid research we refer the reader to gehrels ( 1979 ) and binzel ( 1989 ) .",
    "this paper presents some of the early solar system science from the sdss commissioning data .",
    "these data cover about 5% of the total sky area to be observed by the survey completion ( in about 5 years ) .",
    "section 2 describes the sdss , its capabilities for moving object detection , and the detection algorithm implemented in the photometric processing pipeline .",
    "the data and the accuracy of measured parameters are described in section 3 .",
    "the colors of detected objects are discussed in section 4 , and their proper motions in section 5 .",
    "the distributions of heliocentric distances and sizes of main belt asteroids are discussed in section 6 .",
    "we describe the use of sdss data for finding asteroids in 2mass data in section 7 , the search for kuiper belt objects using multi - epoch sdss data in section 8 , and discuss the results in section 9 .",
    "the sdss is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey which will cover 10,000 deg@xmath1 of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap and produce a smaller ( @xmath14 225 deg@xmath1 ) but much deeper survey in the southern galactic hemisphere ( york _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the survey sky coverage will result in photometric measurements for about 50 million stars and a similar number of galaxies .",
    "the flux densities of detected objects are measured almost simultaneously in five bands ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ; @xcite ) with effective wavelengths of 3561   , 4676   , 6176   , 7494   , and 8873   , 95% complete0.1 arcsec . ] for point sources to limiting magnitudes of 22.1 , 22.4 , 22.1 , 21.2 , and 20.3 in the north galactic cap and @xmath20 because the absolute calibration of the sdss photometric system ( dependent on a network of standard stars ) is still uncertain at the @xmath21 level .",
    "the sdss filters themselves are referred to as @xmath22 and @xmath19 .",
    "all magnitudes are given on the ab@xmath23 system ( oke & gunn 1983 , for additional discussion regarding the sdss photometric system see @xcite , fan 1999 , and fan _ et al . _",

    "astrometric positions are accurate to about 0.1 arcsec per coordinate ( rms ) for sources brighter than 20.5@xmath24 ( pier _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , and the morphological information from the images allows robust star - galaxy separation to @xmath14 21.5@xmath24 ( lupton _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) .",
    "the sdss footprint in ecliptic coordinates is shown in figure [ sdssfoot ] .",
    "the survey avoids the galactic plane , which is of limited use for solar system surveys anyway because of the dense stellar background .",
    "the survey is performed by scanning along great circles , indicated by solid lines .",
    "there are several important areas for solar system science .",
    "the obvious area is the coverage of the ecliptic from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "less obvious is the area around @xmath25 at one end of the great circle scans . here , there will be significant convergence of the scans , so about half of the sky is scanned twice in the course of the survey .",
    "the third region , where the southern strip crosses the ecliptic ( @xmath27 ) , will be scanned several dozen times , and will be useful for studying the inclination and ecliptic latitude distributions of detected objects .",
    "the shaded regions represent areas analyzed in this work , and are described in more detail in section 3.1 .",
    "the sdss camera ( gunn _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) detects objects in the order @xmath28 , with detections in two successive bands separated in time by 72 seconds .",
    "the mean astrometric accuracy for band - to - band transformations is 0.040 arcsec per coordinate ( pier _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . with this accuracy ,",
    "an @xmath29 moving object detection between the @xmath17 and @xmath16 bands corresponds to an angular motion of 0.025  ( or 3.8 arcsec / hr ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the earth reflex motion for an object at a distance of @xmath0 34 au ( i.e. the distance of neptune ) and shows that all types of asteroid ( including trojans ) can be readily detected ( assuming an object at opposition ) . with this level of accuracy",
    "it seems that the motion of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , which are mostly found beyond neptune s orbit , could be detected at a significance level better than 6@xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , the distribution of the astrometric errors ( which include contributions from centroiding and band - to - band transformations ) is not strictly gaussian , and the tests show that the kbos would be effectively detected at only 3@xmath30 level ( a typical kbo would move about 0.3 arcsec between the @xmath17 and @xmath16 exposures )",
    ". since the stellar density at the faint magnitudes probed by sdss is more than 10@xmath31 times larger than the expected kbo density ( @xmath0 0.05 - 0.1 deg@xmath32 for @xmath6 22 , jewitt 1999 ) , the false candidates would preclude the routine detection of kbos .",
    "the upper limit on angular motion for detecting moving objects in a single scan with the present software is about 1 .",
    "this value is determined by the upper limit on the angular distance between detections of an object in two different bands , for them to be classified by the sdss software as a single object .",
    "while somewhat seeing dependent ( see the next section ) , it is sufficiently high not to impose any practical limitation for the detection of main belt asteroids .    the sdss coverage of the size  distance plane for objects on circular orbits observed close to the antisolar point is shown in figure [ window ] .",
    "the two curved lines represent the sdss ccd saturation limit , = 14 , and the faint limit = 22 .",
    "they lines are determined from ( e.g. jewitt 1999 ) where the heliocentric distance , @xmath8 , is measured in au , and @xmath33 is the `` absolute magnitude '' , the magnitude that an asteroid would have at a distance of 1 au from the sun and from the earth , viewed at zero phase angle .",
    "this is an impossible configuration , of course , but the definition is motivated by desire to separate asteroid physical characteristics from the observing configuration .",
    "the absolute magnitude is given by where @xmath34 is the albedo , and the object diameter is @xmath35 ( assuming a spherical asteroid ) . the constant 17.9 was derived by assuming that the apparent magnitude of the sun in the @xmath17 band is -26.95 , obtained from @xmath36 = -26.75 and @xmath37 ( allen 1973 ) with the aid of photometric transformations from fukugita _ et al . _",
    "this constant in an equivalent expression for the iau - recommended ( see e.g. bowel _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) asteroid @xmath38 magnitude ( not to be confused with the near - infrared @xmath38 magnitude at 1.65 @xmath39 ) is 18.1 .",
    "the plotted curves can be shifted vertically by changing the albedo ( we assumed @xmath40 ) .",
    "the vertical line corresponds to an angular motion of 0.025 , approximately transformed into distance by using ( e.g. jewitt 1999 )    the shaded region shows the part of the @xmath35@xmath8 plane that can be explored with single sdss scans .",
    "sdss can detect main belt asteroids with radii larger than @xmath0 100 m , while asteroids larger than @xmath0 10 - 100 km , depending on their distance , saturate the detectors .",
    "the upper limit on the heliocentric distance at which motion can be detected in a single observation is @xmath0 34 au ; at that distance sdss can detect objects larger than 100 km ( although the practical limit on heliocentric distance is somewhat smaller due to confusion with stationary objects , as argued above ) .    without an improvement by about a factor of 2 in relative astrometry",
    ", single sdss scans can not be used to efficiently detect kbos . however",
    ", multiple scans of the same area can be used to search for kbos , and we describe such an effort in section 8 .",
    "the utilization of two - epoch data obtained on time scales of up to several days allows the detection of moving objects at distances as large as 100 au .",
    "for example , at @xmath8 = 50 au sdss can detect objects larger than @xmath0 200 km .      the sdss photometric pipeline ( lupton _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) automatically flags all objects whose position offsets between the detected bands are consistent with motion . without this special treatment , main belt and faster asteroids",
    "would be deblended into one very red and one very blue object , producing false candidates for objects with non - stellar colors . in particular , the candidate quasars selected for sdss spectroscopic observations would be significantly contaminated because they are recognized by their non - stellar colors ( richards _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , objects are detected in the order @xmath41 , with detections in two successive bands separated in time by 72 seconds .",
    "the images of objects moving slower than about 0.5  ( about 1 arcsec during the exposure in a single band ) are indistinguishable from stellar ; only extremely fast near - earth objects are expected to be extended along the motion vector . after finding objects and measuring their peaks in each band , they are merged together by constructing the union of all pixels belonging to them .",
    "the five lists of peaks , one for each band , are then searched for peaks that appear at a given position ( within 2@xmath30 ) in only one band ( if an object is detected at the same position in at least two bands it can not be moving ) .",
    "when all the single - band peaks have been found , if there are detections in at least three bands , the algorithm fits for two components of proper motion ; if the @xmath42 is acceptable ( @xmath23 per degree of freedom ) , and the resulting motion is sufficiently different from zero ( @xmath43 ) , the object is declared moving 0.040 arcsec per coordinate , the proper motion during a few minutes is not sufficiently non - linear to obtain a useful orbital solution . ] .    for the traditional detection methods based on asteroid trails ,",
    "the detection efficiency decreases with the speed of the asteroid at a given magnitude because the trail becomes fainter ( e.g. jedicke & metcalfe , 1998 ) .",
    "any quantitative analysis needs to account for this effect , and the correction is difficult to determine .",
    "one of the advantages of sdss is that the detection efficiency does not depend on the asteroid rate of motion within the relevant range0.5  may be classified by software as separate objects .",
    "they could be searched for at the database level as single band detections .",
    "such analysis will be presented in a separate publication . ]",
    "( most asteroids move slower than 0.5 ) .",
    "we utilize a portion of sdss imaging data from six commissioning runs ( numbered 94 , 125 , 752 , 756 , 745 , and 1336 ) .",
    "the first four runs cover 481.6 deg@xmath1 of sky along the celestial equator ( @xmath44 ) with the ecliptic latitude , @xmath45 , ranging from -14@xmath46 to 20@xmath46 , and the last run covers 16.2 deg@xmath1 of sky with @xmath47 .",
    "the fifth run ( 745 ) covers roughly the same sky region as run 756 , and was obtained 1.99 days earlier .",
    "this two - epoch data set is used to determine the completeness of the asteroid sample and to search for kbos .",
    "the data were taken during the fall of 1998 , the spring of 1999 , and the spring of 2000 .",
    "more details about these runs are given in table 1 .",
    "the data in each run were obtained in six parallel scanlines , each 13.5 arcmin wide ( the six scanlines from adjacent runs are interleaved to make a filled stripe ) .",
    "the seeing in all runs was variable between 1 and 2 arcsec ( fwhm ) with the median values ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 arcsec .",
    "we first select all point sources which are flagged as moving ( see  [ dmflag ] ) and are brighter than = 21.5 .",
    "we choose a more conservative flux limit that discussed above because the accuracy of the star - galaxy separation algorithm is not yet fully characterized at fainter levels ( we note that repeated commissioning scans imply that significantly less than 5% of sources with 21.5 are misclassified ) .",
    "there are 11,216 such moving object candidates in the analyzed area , and the upper panel in figure [ vravdec ] shows their velocity distribution in equatorial coordinates ( for the four equatorial runs which dominate the sample , the @xmath48 velocity component is parallel to the scanning direction ) .",
    "there are two obvious concentrations of objects whose velocities satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "the angle between the velocity vector and the celestial equator is @xmath0 23 deg ( i.e. arctan(0.43 ) ) because the velocity vector is primarily determined by the earth reflex motion , and the asteroid density is maximal at the intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic .",
    "there are two peaks because the sample includes both spring and fall data .",
    "the candidates close to the origin ( @xmath50 , see the lower panel in figure [ vravdec ] ) are probably spurious detections since this velocity range is roughly the same as the expected sensitivity for detecting moving objects ( see  2.2 ) . furthermore , we find that the distribution of these candidates is roughly circularly symmetric around the origin , which further reinforces the conclusion that they are not real detections . consequently ,",
    "in the remaining analysis we consider only the 10,678 moving object candidates with @xmath51 , which for simplicity we will call asteroids hereafter .",
    "the resulting sample is not very sensitive to the value of adopted cut , @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ r - v ] shows the  vs. @xmath52 distribution for the 11,216 moving object candidates .",
    "the vertical strip of objects with @xmath53 are the rejected sources , and the large concentration of sources to the right are 10,678 selected asteroids .",
    "note the strikingly clean gap between the two groups indicating that the false moving object detections are probably well confined to a small velocity range .",
    "it is noteworthy that the objects with @xmath54  are not concentrated towards the faint end , i.e. they do not represent evidence that the moving object algorithm deteriorates for faint sources .",
    "the number of @xmath0 500 objects appears consistent with the expected scatter due to the large number of processed objects ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the sdss scans are very long , and some asteroids are observed at large angles from the antisun direction . as discussed by jedicke ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the observed velocity distribution is therefore significantly changed from the one that would be observed near opposition .",
    "figure [ phi752 ] shows the 2757 asteroids selected from run 752 .",
    "the top panel displays each object as a dot in the ecliptic coordinate system .",
    "the overall scan boundaries , and to some extent the six column boundaries ( the strip is made of six disjoint columns since the data from only one night are displayed ) , are outlined by the object distribution . note that the density of objects decreases with the distance from the ecliptic , as expected .",
    "the dash - dotted line shows the celestial equator .",
    "the lower two panels show the dependence of the two ecliptic components of the measured asteroid velocity , corrected for diurnal motion ( i.e. the proper motion component due to the earth s rotation ) .",
    "these data were obtained on march 21 , and thus the antisun is at @xmath56 .",
    "a strong correlation between the measured velocity and distance from the antisun , @xmath57 , is evident .",
    "following jedicke ( 1996 ) , we derive expressions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for a circular orbit ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the expected errors due to nonvanishing orbital eccentricity are 5 - 10% , depending on the heliocentric distance , @xmath8 and inclination , @xmath60 ( e.g. jedicke & metcalfe 1998 ) .",
    "the two lines in the upper part of the bottom panel show the predicted @xmath61 curves for @xmath8=2 au ( lower , solid ) and @xmath8=3 au ( upper , dashed ) .",
    "the dependence of these curves on inclination is much smaller than on @xmath8 ( the curves are computed for @xmath60 = 0@xmath46 ) .",
    "note that the curves cross for @xmath62 .",
    "the two lines in the lower part of the bottom panel show the predicted @xmath63 curves for @xmath60 = -10@xmath46 ( lower , solid ) and @xmath60 = 10@xmath46 ( upper , dashed ) .",
    "the dependence of these curves on @xmath8 is much smaller than on inclination ( the curves are computed for @xmath8=2.5 au ) .",
    "the plotted curves bracket the observed distribution , and show that it is impossible to accurately estimate the heliocentric distance for large @xmath64 since the @xmath65 curves cross . since the heliocentric distance is crucial for a significant part of the analysis presented here , we further limit the sample to @xmath66 , except when studying the ecliptic latitude distribution ( section 4.2.1 ) and the dependence of colors on the phase angle ( section 6.2 ) .",
    "this constraint produces a sample of 6666 asteroids .",
    "we estimate the heliocentric distance and orbital inclination for these asteroids as described in  3.4.2 .      the sample completeness ( the fraction of moving objects in the data recognized as such by the moving object algorithm ) and reliability ( the fraction of correctly recognized moving objects ) are important factors which can significantly affect the conclusions derived in the subsequent analysis .",
    "it is not possible to determine the completeness and reliability by comparing the sample with catalogued asteroids because existing catalogs are complete only to 15 - 16 ( zappala & cellino 1996 , jedicke & metcalfe 1998 ) , while this sample extends to = 21.5 ( less than 1/3 of moving objects observed by sdss can be linked to previously documented asteroids , see appendix b ) .",
    "we estimate the sample completeness and reliability by analyzing data for 99.5 deg@xmath1 of sky observed twice 1.9943 days apart ( runs 745 and 756 , see table 1 ) .",
    "these two runs were obtained during sdss commissioning and overlap almost perfectly .",
    "we estimate the sample reliability by matching 2474 objects selected by the moving object algorithm in run 756 to the source catalog for run 745 .",
    "the probability that two moving objects would be found at an identical position in two runs is negligible , and such a matched pair indicates a stationary object that was erroneously flagged as moving .",
    "we find 62 matches within 1 arcsec implying a sample reliability of 97.5% .",
    "visual inspection shows that the majority of false detections are either associated with saturated stars , or are close to the faint limit for detectability .",
    "objects with very unusual velocities are more likely to be false detections ; we discuss further the reliability of such candidates in section 5.4 .",
    "the sample completeness can be obtained by comparing 2412 reliable detections to the  true \" number of moving objects in the data . this",
    " true \" number can be estimated by using the fact that the true moving objects observed in one epoch will not have a positional counterpart in the other epoch .",
    "there are 4808 unsaturated point sources brighter than = 21.5 from run 756 that do not have counterparts within 3 arcsec in run 745 ( the number of matched objects is @xmath67 ) .",
    "not all 4808 unmatched objects are moving objects , as many are not matched due to instrumental effects ( e.g. diffraction spikes , blended sources , etc . ) .",
    "the hard part is to select moving objects among these 4808 objects without relying on the moving object algorithm itself .",
    "we select the probable moving objects by using the difference between the point - spread - function ( psf ) and  model \" magnitudes in the @xmath16 band , and taking advantage of a bug in the code , since fixed .",
    "the psf magnitudes are measured by fitting a psf model , and model magnitudes are measured by fitting an exponential and a de vaucouleurs profile convolved with the psf , and using the formally better model in the @xmath17 band to evaluate the magnitude ( lupton _ et al .",
    "model magnitudes are designed for galaxy photometry and become equal to the psf magnitudes for unresolved sources , if they are not moving .",
    "the difference between the psf and model magnitudes for moving unresolved sources is due to different choices of centroids . for psf magnitudes the local centroid in each band",
    "is used , while for model magnitudes the @xmath17 band center is used .",
    "the moving objects thus have fainter model magnitudes than psf magnitudes in all bands but @xmath17 ( the point sources have small @xmath68 by definition ) .",
    "this difference is maximized for the @xmath16 band and we find that 4808 unmatched sources show a bimodal distribution of @xmath69 with a well - defined minimum at about @xmath70 .",
    "there are 2424 sources with @xmath71 , and they can be considered as  true \" moving objects ( that is , we are essentially comparing two different detection algorithms ) . in the same area",
    "there are 2412 objects flagged by the moving object algorithm , and 2377 of these are included in the above 2424 , implying that the sample completeness is 98% ( this is indeed a lower limit on the sample completeness since it is possible that some of the 2424 sources with @xmath72 are not truly moving ) .",
    "while the sample completeness and reliability are sufficiently high for robust statistical analysis of the moving objects , inaccurate velocity measurements may contribute significant uncertainty because the heliocentric distance is determined from the asteroid rate of motion .",
    "figure [ photoerrors ] gives an overview of the achieved accuracy , as quoted by the photometric pipeline .",
    "the top panel shows the velocity error vs. velocity , and the middle panel shows the velocity error vs.  magnitude , where each of the 6666 asteroids is shown as a dot .",
    "it is evident that the errors are dominated by photon statistics at the faint end .",
    "the histogram of the fractional velocity errors displayed in the bottom panel shows that , for the majority of objects , the accuracy is better than 4% .    of course , it is not certain whether the quoted errors are realistic .",
    "a test requires independent velocity measurements .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of the measured velocity by comparing two adjacent runs ( 752 and 756 , see table 1 ) obtained one day apart .",
    "these two runs can be interleaved to make a full stripe .",
    "thanks to a fortuitous combination of the column width ( 13.5 arcmin ) and the time delay between the two scans , many asteroids observed in the first run move into the area scanned by the second run the following night . out of 1626 asteroids with @xmath66",
    "observed in run 752 , 693 were expected to be reobserved in run 756 . for reobserved objects",
    "the velocity can be obtained about 300 times more accurately than from single run data , due to longer time baseline ( 24 hours vs. 5 minutes ) .",
    "we positionally match within 60 arcsec these 693 asteroids to the asteroids observed in run 756 , and find 476 matches . by rematching a random set of positions within the same matching radius , we estimate that about 18 are random associations , implying a true matching rate of 66% ( this matching rate is substantially lower than the reliability of the sample because of the velocity errors ) .",
    "the association of the two samples with a larger matching radius increases the number of close pairs but also increases the fraction of random associations .",
    "we find that matched and unmatched objects have similar magnitude distributions , showing that the algorithm is robust at the faint end .",
    "the detailed matching statistics are presented in figure [ matchesx ] .",
    "the histograms of the differences between the predicted and observed positions in the second epoch are shown in the top row .",
    "as discussed earlier , the matched position can be used to determine the asteroid velocity to a much better precision than from single run data .",
    "the two panels in the second row in figure [ matchesx ] show the histograms of the difference between this  true \" velocity and the measured velocity in run 756 , normalized by the quoted errors .",
    "the quoted errors are overestimated by factor 2 , presumably due to overestimated centroiding errors in the photometric pipeline ( whose computation has been meanwhile improved ) .",
    "the two panels in the third row show that the velocity difference is correlated with neither the velocity nor the object s brightness ( if comparing these two panels with the middle panel in figure [ photoerrors ] , note that here only 476 matched objects are included , while there all 6666 objects are shown )",
    ".    the same matched data can be used to test the photometric accuracy .",
    "the photometric errors determined by comparing measurements for stars observed in two epochs are about 2 - 3% for objects at the bright end , and then start increasing due to photon counting noise ( for more details see ivezi _ et al .",
    "the bottom two panels in figure [ matchesx ] show the histograms of the observed differences in  magnitude ( lower left panel ) and asteroid @xmath73 color ( to be defined in the next section , lower right panel ) .",
    "the histogram for all 476 matched asteroids is shown by a solid line , and for 165 asteroids with @xmath74 by a dot - dashed line . from the interquartile range we estimate that the equivalent gaussian width of the  histogram is 0.11 mag , and the width of the @xmath73 histogram is 0.07 mag , independent of the magnitude limit .",
    "the color histogram is narrower than the magnitude histogram , although its width is expected to be between 1 and @xmath75 times wider than the width of the magnitude difference histogram , based on the statistical considerations .",
    "this may be interpreted as the variability due to asteroid rotation which affects the brightness but not the color .",
    "such an interpretation was first advanced by kuiper _",
    "et al . _ ( 1958 ) .    in the subsequent analysis",
    "we consider only the sample with 5253 unique sources , formed by excluding sources from runs 94 and 752 whose positions and velocities imply that they are also observed in runs 125 and 756 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty of measured velocities will result in some sources being incorrectly excluded , and some sources being counted twice .",
    "however , the excluded sources represent only @xmath76 of the full sample , and thus even an uncertainty of 20% in the sample of excluded sources corresponds to less than 5% of the final sample .",
    "more importantly , no significant bias with respect to brightness , color , position , and velocity is expected in this procedure , as shown above .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for the 5,125 main belt asteroids ( selected by their velocity vectors as described in  5.1 below ) is displayed in the upper left panel in figure [ cmdmb ] .",
    "the other three panels display color - color diagrams and @xmath77 , accurate to within 0.05 mag . ] . for clarity , in the last three diagrams",
    "the asteroid distribution is shown by linearly spaced density contours in the regions of high density and as dots outside the lowest level contour .",
    "it is evident that the asteroid color distribution is bimodal , in agreement with previous studies of smaller samples ( binzel 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the two color types are clearly separated in the  vs.  color - color diagram which shows two well defined peaks .",
    "the comparison of the observed color distributions with the colors of known asteroids observed in the sdss bands by krisciunas , margon & szkody ( 1998 ) shows that the  blue \" asteroids in the  vs.  diagram ( lower left peak ) can be associated with the c type ( carbonaceous ) asteroids , while the redder class ( upper right peak ) corresponds to the s type ( silicate , rocky ) asteroids .",
    "however , note that not all  blue \" asteroids are c type asteroids , and not all  red \" asteroids are s type asteroids , but rather they contain other taxonomic classes as well .",
    "for example , tedesco _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 ) defined 11 families among 357 asteroids , based on iras photometry and three wideband optical filters .",
    "the iras photometry is used to determine the albedo which , together with the two colors , defines the taxonomic classes .",
    "nevertheless , the same work shows that a large majority of all asteroids belong to either c or s type , and we find that sdss photometry clearly differentiates between the two types .",
    "tedesco _ et al .",
    "_ noted that much of the difference in the asteroid spectra between 0.3  and 1.1  is due to two strong absorption features , one bluer than 0.55  and one redder than 0.70 .",
    "the sdss @xmath17 filter lies almost entirely between these two absorption features , which may explain why the @xmath78 and @xmath79 colors provide good separation of the two color types .",
    "moreover , the  vs.  color - color diagram is constructed with the most sensitive sdss bands .",
    "we use this diagram to define an optimized color that can be used to quantify the correlations between asteroid colors and other properties ( e.g. heliocentric distance , as discussed in the next section ) .",
    "we rotate and translate the  vs.  coordinate system such that the new x - axis , hereafter called , passes through both peaks , and define its value for the minimum asteroid density between the peaks to be 0 ( i.e. we find the principal components in the  vs.  color - color diagram ) .",
    "we obtain asteroids with @xmath2 0 are blue in the  vs.  diagram , and those with @xmath80 0 are red .",
    "figure [ cmdmbb ] shows various diagrams constructed with this optimized color .",
    "the top left panel displays the  vs.  color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the two color types are much more clearly separated than in the analogous diagram using the  color ( displayed in the top left panel in figure [ cmdmb ] ) .",
    "the top right panel shows the -histogram for asteroids brighter than = 20 .",
    "the number of main belt asteroids with @xmath81 is 1.88 times larger than the number of asteroids with @xmath82 ( 1.47 times for @xmath2 21.5 ) .",
    "however , note that this result does not represent a true number ratio of the two types because the same flux limit does not correspond to the same size limit due to different albedos , and because of their different radial distributions ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the two middle panels show the color - color diagrams constructed with the new color .",
    "these diagrams suggest that the distribution of the sdss colors for the main belt asteroids reveals only two major classes : the asteroids with @xmath2 0 have bluer color and slightly redder  color than asteroids with @xmath80 0 .",
    "these color differences are better seen in the color histograms shown in the two bottom panels , where thick solid lines correspond to asteroids with @xmath83 , and the thin dashed lines to those with @xmath84 . in the remainder of this work we will refer to  blue \" and  red \" asteroids as determined by their  color , but",
    "note that the  colors are reversed ( the subsample with bluer  color is redder in other sdss colors ) .",
    "the large number of detected objects and accurate 5-color sdss photometry may allow for a more detailed asteroid classification .",
    "for example , some objects have very blue  colors ( @xmath85 , see figure [ cmdmbb ] ) which could indicate a separate family",
    ". there are various ways to form self - similar classes , well described by tholen & barucci ( 1989 ) .",
    "we decided to use the program autoclass in an unsupervised search for possible structure .",
    "autoclass employs bayesian probability analysis to automatically separate a given data base into classes ( goebel _ et al .",
    "this program was used by ivezi & elitzur ( 2000 ) to demonstrate that the iras psc sources belong to four distinct classes that occupy separate regions in the 4-dimensional space spanned by iras fluxes , and the problem at hand is mathematically equivalent .",
    "autoclass separated main - belt asteroids into 4 classes by using 5 sdss magnitudes ( not the colors ! ) for objects brighter than = 20 .",
    "the largest 2 classes include more than 98% of objects and are easily recognized in color - color diagrams as the two groups discussed earlier .",
    "the remaining 2% of sources are equally split in two groups .",
    "one of them is the already suspected group with @xmath86 .",
    "the inspection of color - color diagrams for these sources shows that the blue @xmath87 color is their only clearly distinctive characteristic .",

    ", we synthesize their colors from spectra obtained by xu _",

    "we convolved their spectra with the sdss response functions for the @xmath88 and @xmath19 bands ( the spectra do not extend to sufficiently short wavelengths for synthesizing the @xmath15 band flux ) .",
    "the results are summarized in the color - color diagrams displayed in figure [ smass ] . the taxonomic classification ( also adopted from xu _",
    "_ ) is shown by different symbols : crosses for the c type , dots for s , circles for d , solid squares for a , open squares for v , solid triangles for j , and open triangles for the e , m and p types ( which are indistinguishable by their colors ) .",
    "the dashed lines in the upper panel show the principal axes discussed above .",
    "these diagrams show that the blue asteroids ( @xmath89 ) include the c , e , m and p classes , while the red asteroids ( @xmath90 ) include the s , d , a , v , and j classes .",

    "the segregation of the classes in the  vs.  diagram is evident .",
    "it may be that the d class asteroids could be separated by their red  color ( @xmath91 ) , and that the v and j classes could be separated by their blue  color ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , note that the number of sources in these classes shown in figure [ smass ] is not representative of the sdss sample due to a different selection procedure employed by the smass . restricting the analysis to asteroids with @xmath220",

    "we leave further analysis of such classification possibilities for future work , and conclude that the synthetic colors based on the smass data agree well with the observed color distribution .",
    "the observed differences in the color distributions reflect differences in asteroid albedos . although the sdss photometry can not be used to estimate the absolute albedos ( which would require the measurements of the thermal emission , see e.g. tedesco _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) , the spectral shape of the albedo can be easily calculated since the colors of the illuminating source are well known ( @xmath93 = 1.32 , @xmath94 = 0.45 , @xmath95 = 0.10 , @xmath96 = 0.04 ) .",

    "the dotted curve shows the mean albedo for asteroids selected from the @xmath97 group by requiring @xmath85 .",
    "the displayed wavelength dependence of the albedo is in good agreement with available spectroscopic data ( e.g. compare to figure 5 in tholen & barucci 1989 , see also figure 2 in xu _",

    "the subsequent analysis of the asteroid size distribution requires the knowledge of the absolute albedo for each color type .",
    "the typical absolute values of albedos for the two major asteroid types can be estimated from data presented by zellner ( 1979 ) .",

    "the intrinsic spread of albedo for each class is of the order 20% , in agreement with the range obtained by using iras data ( tedesco _ et al .",
    "this difference in albedos implies that a c - like asteroid is @xmath141.4 magnitudes fainter than an s - like asteroid of the same size and at the same observed position , and that a c - like asteroid with the same apparent magnitude and observed at the same position is twice as large as an s - like asteroid .",

    ", we estimate that there are 280,000 asteroids brighter than @xmath107 ( observed near opposition ) .",
    "this estimate implies that sdss will observe @xmath109 asteroids by its completion ( see figure [ sdssfoot ] ) .",
    "we note that a fraction of these observations may be measurements of the same asteroids .",
    "this fraction depends on the details of which areas of sky are observed when , and can not be estimated beforehand .",
    "the brightness distribution of asteroids can be directly transformed into their size distribution if all asteroids have the same albedo , and either have the same heliocentric distance , or the size distribution is a scaleless power law .",
    "while none of these conditions is true , we discuss the counts of asteroids as a function of apparent magnitude because they clearly differ for the two color types .",
    "the relationship between the distribution of apparent magnitudes and heliocentric and size distributions is discussed in more detail in section 6 below .",
    "the measured counts for main - belt asteroids , separated by their  color , are shown in figure [ countsmb ] ( here we do not apply the phase angle correction , see section 6.1 ) .",
    "the circles correspond to asteroids with @xmath98 , and the squares correspond to the @xmath81 asteroids .",
    "the latter are shifted upwards by 1 dex for clarity .",
    "a striking feature visible in both curves is the sharp change of slope around 18 - 19 .",
    "we find that for both color types the counts vs. magnitude relation can be described by a broken power law for @xmath110 , and for @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the magnitude for the power law break .",
    "the best fits are shown by lines in figure [ countsmb ] , and the corresponding parameters are listed in table 3 .",
    "the changes in the slope of the counts vs. magnitude relations could be caused by systematic effects in the detection algorithm .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ countsmb ] show the extrapolation of the bright end power - law fit , and indicate that a decrease of detection efficiency by a factor of 10 is required to explain the observed counts at 21.5 .",

    "the number of asteroids with 21 is roughly ten times smaller than would expected from extrapolation of the power - law relation observed for @xmath6 18 .",
    "the changes in the slope of the counts vs. magnitude relations disagree with a simple model proposed by dohnanyi ( 1969 ) , which is based on an equilibrium cascade in self - similar collisions , and which predicts a universal slope of 0.5 .",

    "figure [ vlambdavbeta ] shows the velocity distribution in ecliptic coordinates for the sample of 5,253 unique asteroids .",
    "its overall morphology is in agreement with other studies ( e.g. scotti , gehrels & rabinowitz 1991 , jedicke 1996 ) and shows a large concentration of the main belt asteroids at @xmath113 -0.22  and @xmath114 .",
    "the sharp cutoff in their distribution at @xmath113 -0.28  is not a selection effect and corresponds to objects at a heliocentric distance of @xmath0 2 au .",

    "this separation in essence reflects different inclinations and orbital sizes of various asteroid families ( for more details see e.g. gradie , chapman & williams 1979 , zellner , thirunagari & bender 1985 ) .",
    "these regions are modeled after the spacewatch boundary for distinguishing neos from other asteroids ( rabinowitz 1991 ) , information provided in jedicke ( 1996 ) , and taking into account the velocity distribution observed by sdss .",
    "there is some degree of arbitrariness in the proposed boundaries , for example the regions corresponding to hungarias and mars crossers could be merged together . the boundary definitions and asteroid counts for each region are listed in table 2 ( as indicated in the table , the visual inspection shows that some objects are spurious ; see  5.4 below ) .",
    "these subsamples are used for comparative analysis of their colors and spatial distributions in the following sections .",
    "we emphasize that this separation can not be used as a definitive identification of an asteroid with a particular family .",
    "in particular , the main belt asteroids may cause significant contamination of other regions due to the measurement scatter and their large number compared to other families .",
    "six orbital elements are required to define the motion of an asteroid .",
    "since the sdss observations determine only four parameters ( two sky coordinates and two velocity components ) the orbit is not fully constrained by the available data .",
    "there are various methods to obtain approximate estimates for the orbital parameters from the asteroid motion vectors ( e.g. bowell , skiff , wasserman & russell 1989 , and references therein ) .",
    "these methods provide an accuracy of about 0.05 - 0.1 au for determining the semimajor axes , and 1 - 5 deg . for the inclination accuracy .",
    "as shown by jedicke & metcalfe ( 1998 ) , similar accuracy can be obtained by assuming that the orbits are circular .",
    "we follow jedicke ( 1996 ) and derive the expressions for observed ecliptic velocity components in terms of @xmath8 , @xmath60 and @xmath64 listed in appendix a. we show in appendix b that these expressions can be used to estimate the heliocentric distance at the time of observation with an accuracy of 0.28 au ( rms ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimated heliocentric distance is significantly larger than the uncertainty in the estimated semimajor axes ( 0.07 au ) because asteroid orbits in fact have considerable eccentricity ( 0.10 - 0.15 ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that the estimates for heliocentric distance and semimajor axes are simply proportional to each other ( for more details see appendix b ) .",
    "the uncertainty of 0.28 au in the estimate of heliocentric distance contributes an uncertainty of 0.5 - 0.8 mag . in the absolute magnitude ( see eq .",

    "the overall morphology is in agreement with other studies ( e.g. see figure 1 of zappala _ et al .",
    "the multi - color sdss data allow the separation of asteroids into two types , and the middle and bottom panels show the distribution of each color type separately . because the heliocentric distance estimates have an accuracy of 0.28 au , these data can not resolve narrow features values , since they are gaps in the distribution of asteroid semi - major axis , not @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath8 distribution is smeared out because the orbits are randomly oriented ellipses . ] .",
    "nevertheless , it is evident that the red asteroids tend to be closer to the sun .",
    "another illustration of the differences in the distribution of the two color types is shown in figure [ hr ] which displays the cross - section of the asteroid belt : the horizontal axis is the heliocentric distance and the vertical axis is the distance from the ecliptic plane . the top panel shows the distribution of all asteroids and the middle and bottom panels show the distribution of each color type separately .",
    "the dashed lines in the left column are drawn at @xmath122 and show the observational limits .",
    "the dashed lines in the right column mark the position of the maximum density and are added to guide the eye .",
    "note that the maximum density for blue asteroids ( middle panel ) lies about 0.4 au further out than for red asteroids .",

    "each asteroid is marked as a dot , and the bottom panel shows the isodensity contours .",
    "it is evident that the bimodal color distribution persists at all heliocentric distances .",
    "the distributions of both types have a well defined maximum , evident in the bottom panel , which may be interpreted as the existence of two distinct belts : the inner , relatively wide belt dominated by red ( s - like ) asteroids and the outer , relatively narrow belt , dominated by blue ( c - like ) asteroids .",
    "we emphasize that the detailed radial distribution of asteroids in this diagram is strongly biased by the heliocentric distance dependent faint limit in absolute magnitude , and these effects will be discussed in more quantitative detail in section 6 .",
    "nevertheless , the _ difference _ between the two types is not strongly affected by this effect , and the remarkable split of the asteroid belt into two components is a robust result .",

    "the color distribution of asteroids depends strongly on heliocentric distance .",
    "figure [ histavsr ] compares the -color histograms for three subsamples selected by heliocentric distance : @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "the thick solid lines show the color distribution of each subsample , and the thin dashed lines show the color distribution of the whole sample .      while the sample reliability is estimated to be 98.5% in section [ comrel ] , it is probable that it is much lower for asteroids with unusual velocities . to estimate the fraction of reliable detections for such asteroids ,",
    "we visually inspect images for the 128 asteroids which are not classified as main belt asteroids . as a control sample , and also for an additional reliability estimate , we inspect 50 randomly selected main belt asteroids , and the 50 brightest and 50 faintest main belt asteroids .",
    "while the visual inspection of 278 images for the motion signature may seem a formidable task , it is indeed quite simple and robust .",
    "since asteroids move they can be easily recognized by their peculiar colors in the @xmath126 color composites .",
    "moving objects appear as aligned green  red  blue `` stars '' , with the blue - red distance three times larger than the green - red distance ( due to filter spacings , see section [ dmflag ] ) .",
    "we find that neither of the two candidates for centaurs are real . about 63% of neos ( 12/19 ) , 57% of mars",
    "crossers ( 4/7 ) , 50% of trojans ( 1/2 ) and 43% of unknown ( 6/14 ) are not real .",
    "the contamination of the remaining subsamples is lower ; only 5% for hildas ( 3/59 ) , while all 25 hungarias are real .",
    "the majority of false detections are either associated with saturated stars , or are close to the faint limit .",
    "for all 3 subsamples with main belt asteroids the contamination is 2% ( there is 1 instrumental effect per 50 objects in each class ) . since the fraction of objects not classified as main belt asteroids is very small ( 2% ) , these results are consistent with estimates described in  3.2 .",
    "the color distributions of various families are particularly useful for linking them to other asteroid populations and constraining theories for their origin .",
    "for example , one possible source of the neos is the main belt asteroids near the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter .",
    "these asteroids have chaotic orbits whose eccentricities increase until they become mars crossing , after which they are scattered into the inner solar system ( wisdom 1986 ) .",
    "if this scenario is true , the colors of both the neos and mars crossers should resemble the colors of main belt asteroids , but show more similarity to the c - type asteroids than to the whole sample due to the radial color gradient .",
    "an alternative source of neos is extinct comet nuclei ; this hypothesis predicts a wider color range than observed for asteroids .",
    "yet another hypothesis was forwarded by bell _",
    "( 1989 ) who predicted that neos should be more similar to s type than to c type asteroids . while there seems to be more evidence supporting the first hypothesis ( shoemaker et al .",
    "1979 ) , the analyzed samples are small .",
    "we find that 70% of the visually confirmed neos ( 5/7 ) , unknown ( 6/8 ) hungarias ( 17/25 ) , and mars crossers ( 2/3 ) belong to the blue type ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "more than half of the remaining 30% are typically borderline red ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the overall color distribution of main belt asteroids , where the fraction of blue asteroids is only 40% , and the fraction of asteroids with @xmath127 is 47% .",
    "the result for neos implies that their source is the asteroid belt , rather than extinct comet nuclei .",
    "furthermore , it supports the hypothesis they originate in the outer part of the asteroid belt ) . ] , contrary to the prediction by bell _",
    "et al._. the colors of hungarias and neos are similar , which is in agreement with the notion that hungarias are an intermediate phase for the main belt asteroids on their route to becoming the neos .",
    "while it is not clear what the origin of asteroids from the `` unknown '' region is , they are as blue as are hungarias and neos .",
    "the only confirmed trojan candidate is distinctively red ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "such a red color seems to agree with the colors of some centaurs ( luu & jewitt 1996 ) though it is hard to judge the significance of this result .",
    "we note that the kuiper belt object candidate discussed in section 8 is also significantly redder ( @xmath129 ) than the main belt color distribution .",
    "the size distribution of asteroids is one of most significant observational constraints on their history ( e.g. jedicke & metcalfe 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is also one of the hardest quantities to determine observationally because of strong selection effects . not only that the smallest observable asteroid size in a flux limited sample strongly varies with the heliocentric distance , but the conversion from the observed magnitude to asteroid size depends on the , usually unknown , albedo . assuming a mean albedo for all asteroids may lead to significant biases since the mean albedo depends on the heliocentric distance due to varying chemical composition .",
    "because of its multi - color photometry , sdss provides an opportunity to disentangle these effects by separately treating each of the two dominant classes , which are known to have rather narrow albedo distributions ( see section 4.1.2 ) .    for a fixed albedo",
    ", the slope of the counts vs. magnitude relation , @xmath130 , is related to the power - law index , @xmath131 , of the asteroid differential size distribution , @xmath132 , via this simple relation assumes that the size distribution is a scale - free power law independent of distance , which results in a linear relationship between log(counts ) and apparent magnitude .",
    "however , the observed change of slope around 18 in the differential counts of asteroids ( discussed in section 4.2.3 ) introduces a magnitude scale which prevents a straightforward transformation from the counts to size distribution .    in the limit where a single power law is a good approximation to the observed counts ,",
    "the above relation can still be used and shows that the power law index @xmath131 of the asteroid size distribution is 4 at the bright end and 2.5 at the faint end for both color families ( see table 3 ) . since these values may be somewhat biased by the phase angle effect , and the strong dependence of the faint cutoff for absolute magnitude on heliocentric distance , in this section we perform a detailed analysis of the observed counts . by applying techniques developed for determining the luminosity function of extragalactic sources",
    ", we estimate unbiased size and heliocentric distance distributions for the two asteroid types .",
    "the observed apparent magnitude of an asteroid strongly depends on the phase angle , @xmath133 , the angle between the sun and the earth as viewed from the asteroid we first determine the  uncorrected \" absolute magnitude from where @xmath134 is the earth - asteroid distance expressed in au , and correct it for the phase angle effect by subtracting the adopted correction is based on the observations of asteroid 951 gaspra ( kowal 1989 ) and may not be applicable to all asteroids . in particular , the true correction could depend on the asteroid type ( bowel & lumme 1979 ) .",
    "however , as shown by bowel & lumme the differences between the c and s types for @xmath135 are not larger than 0.02 mag .",
    "the strong dependence of the correction on @xmath133 for small @xmath133 is known as the  opposition effect \" ; the adopted value agrees with contemporary practice ( e.g. jedicke & metcalfe 1998 ) .",
    "note that although the phase angle correction is somewhat uncertain , it is smaller than the error in @xmath33 due to uncertain @xmath8 ( 0.5 - 0.8 mag ) even for objects at the limit of our sample ( @xmath136 , corresponding to @xmath137 ) .",
    "the dimming due to a non - zero phase angle need not be the same at all wavelengths , and in principle the colors could also depend on the observed phase angle due to so - called differential albedo effect ( bowel & lumme 1979 , and references therein ) .",
    "while such an effect does not have direct impact on the determination of size and heliocentric distance distributions , it would provide a strong constraint on the reflectance properties of asteroid surfaces .",
    "we investigate the dependence of color @xmath73 on angle @xmath64 by comparing the color histograms for objects observed close to opposition and for objects observed at large @xmath64 .",
    "the top panel in figure [ oposition ] shows the @xmath73 color for 4591 asteroids with photometric errors less than 0.05 mag . in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 bands , as a function of the opposition angle @xmath64 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the color distribution for 1150 asteroids observed close to opposition by the dashed line , and the color distribution for 1244 asteroids observed at large @xmath64 by the solid line .",
    "we find a significant difference in the @xmath138 relation for the two types of asteroids : the blue asteroids ( @xmath89 ) are redder by @xmath139 mag when observed at large phase angles , while the color distribution for red asteroids ( @xmath90 ) widens for large phase angles , without a corresponding change of the median value .",
    "the same analysis applied to other colors shows that the dependence on @xmath64 is the strongest for the  color , and insignificant for other colors .",
    "while the magnitude of this effect seems to agree with the value of 0.0015 mag deg@xmath9 observed for the johnson @xmath140 color ( bowel & lumme 1979 ) , the difference in the behavior of the two predominant asteroid classes has not been previously reported .    another effect which could bias",
    "the interpretation of the asteroid counts is the possible dependence of the asteroid color on absolute magnitude . since for a given albedo",
    "the absolute magnitude is a measure of asteroid size , the dependence of the asteroid surface properties on its size could be observed as a correlation between the color and absolute magnitude .",
    "figure [ avsr10 ] shows the distribution of asteroids in the color vs. absolute magnitude diagram for each color type separately ( the top panel shows asteroids as dots , and the bottom panel shows isodensity contours ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude was calculated by using eq.[distmod2 ] , and the heliocentric distance as described in section 5.2 .",
    "the two dashed lines are fitted separately for the @xmath89 and @xmath90 subsamples .",
    "there is no significant correlation between the asteroid color and absolute magnitude ( the slopes are consistent with 0 , with errors less than 0.005 mag mag@xmath9 ) .",
    "the differential counts of asteroids can be used to infer their size distribution if all asteroids have the same albedo . however , while the albedo within each of the two major asteroid types has a fairly narrow distribution ( the scatter is 20% around the mean ) , the mean albedo for the two classes differs by almost a factor of 4 ( zellner 1979 , tedesco _ et al .",
    "the fact that the composition of the asteroid belt , and thus the mean albedo , varies with heliocentric distance has been a significant drawback for the determination of the size distribution ( e.g. jedicke & metcalfe 1998 ) .",
    "sdss data can remedy this problem because the colors are sufficiently accurate to separate asteroids into the two classes .",
    "we assume in the following analysis that each color type is fairly well represented by a uniform albedo .",
    "we determine various distributions for each type separately , but also for the whole sample in order to allow comparison with previous work .      for a given apparent magnitude limit ( here = 21.5 ) , the faint limit on absolute magnitude is a strong function of heliocentric distance ( see e.g. eq .  [ distmod ] ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath8=2 au , = 21.5 corresponds to ( 1,0 ) = 19 , while at @xmath8=3.5 au , the limit is only 16.8 . when interpreting the observed distribution of objects in the ( 1,0 ) vs. @xmath8 plane",
    ", this effect must be properly taken into account .",
    "this problem is mathematically equivalent to the well studied case of the determination of the luminosity function for a flux limited sample ( e.g. fan _ et al .",
    "_ 2001b and references therein ) .",
    "the top panels in figures [ figlfblue ] and [ figlfred ] show the ( 1,0 ) vs. @xmath8 distribution of the two color - selected samples .",
    "we seek to determine the marginal distributions of sources in the ( 1,0 ) and @xmath8 directions .",
    "it is usually assumed that these two distributions are uncorrelated ( i.e. the ( 1,0 ) distribution is the same everywhere in the belt , and the radial distribution is the same for all ( 1,0 ) ) .",
    "the sample discussed here is sufficiently large to test this assumption explicitly , and we do so using two methods .",
    "first , we simply define three regions in the ( 1,0 ) vs. @xmath8 plane , outlined by different lines in the top panels , and compare the properly normalized histograms of objects for each of the two coordinates .",
    "if the distributions of ( 1,0 ) and @xmath8 are uncorrelated , then all three histograms must agree .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom panels ; the left panels show @xmath8 histograms , and the right panels show ( 1,0 ) histograms ( shown by points , the dashed lines will be discussed further below ) . in all four panels ,",
    "the three histograms are consistent within errors ( not plotted for clarity ) .",
    "that is , there is no evidence that the two distributions are correlated .",
    "another method to test for correlation between the two distributions is based on kendall s @xmath141 statistic ( efron & petrosian 1992 ) , and is well described by fan _",
    "2001b ( see  2.2 ) . for uncorrelated distributions",
    "the value of this statistic should be much smaller than unity .",
    "we find the values of 0.11 and 0.07 , for the blue and red samples respectively , again indicating that ( 1,0 ) and @xmath8 are uncorrelated .",
    "the @xmath8 and ( 1,0 ) distributions plotted in the bottom panels of figures [ figlfblue ] and [ figlfred ] are not optimally determined because they are based on only small portions of the full data set , and also suffer from binning .",
    "lynden - bell ( 1971 ) derived an optimal method to determine the marginal distributions for uncorrelated variables that does not require binning and uses all the data .",
    "we implemented this method , termed the @xmath142 method , as described in fan _",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "the output is the cumulative distribution of each variable , evaluated at the measured value for each object in the sample .",
    "one weakness of this method is that the uncertainty estimate for the evaluated cumulative distributions is not available .",
    "we determine the differential distributions by binning the sample in the relevant variable , and assume the poisson statistics based on the number of sources in each bin to estimate the errors .",
    "the top panel in figure [ sigmar ] shows the surface density of asteroids as a function of heliocentric distance .",
    "the surface density is computed as the differential marginal distribution in the @xmath8 direction , divided by @xmath8 .",
    "the overall normalization is arbitrary and will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the full sample , the dashed line to red asteroids , and the dot - dashed line to blue asteroids .",
    "the relative normalization of the two types corresponds to samples limited by absolute magnitude .",
    "the distribution for the full sample is in good agreement with the results obtained by jedicke & metcalfe ( 1998 , figure 3 ) . in particular",
    ", the depletion of asteroids near @xmath143 spanning the range from the 5:2 to 7:3 mean motion resonance with jupiter is clearly visible .",
    "figure [ sigmar ] confirms earlier evidence ( see e.g. figure [ avsr ] ) that the heliocentric distance distributions of the two types of asteroids are remarkably different .",
    "this difference may be interpreted as two distinct asteroid belts : the inner belt dominated by red ( s - like ) asteroids , centered at @xmath8 2.8 au , with a fwhm of 1 au , and the outer belt , dominated by blue ( c - like ) asteroids , centered at @xmath8 3.2 au , with a fwhm of 0.5 au .",
    "this distinction is also motivated by the strikingly different _ radial shapes _ of the surface density .",
    "it may be possible to derive strong constraints on the asteroid history by modeling the curves shown in figure [ sigmar ] , but this is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the distribution of red asteroids is fairly symmetric around @xmath144 au , while the distribution of blue asteroids is skewed and extends all the way to @xmath145 au .",
    "the overall shape indicates that it may represent a sum of two roughly symmetric components , with the weaker component centered at @xmath8 2.5 au , and the stronger component centered at @xmath8 3.2 au .",
    "gradie & tedesco ( 1982 ) showed that the distribution of m type asteroids has a local maximum around @xmath146 au .",
    "furthermore , these asteroids have colors similar to c type asteroids ( see figure [ smass ] ) and can be distinguished only by their large albedo . thus , it may be possible that @xmath147 of blue asteroids found at small @xmath8 ( @xmath148 au ) are dominated by m type asteroids .",
    "the bottom panel shows the fractional contribution of each type to the total surface density .",
    "the number ratio of the red to blue type changes from 4:1 in the inner belt to 1:3 in the outer belt ( note that the number ratio for the outer belt has a large uncertainty ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the amplitudes of the distributions of asteroids shown in the top panel , and thus the resulting number fractions , are strongly dependent on the sample definition .",
    "the plotted distributions , and the change of number fractions from 4:1 to 1:3 , correspond to an equal cutoff in absolute magnitude .",
    "however , it could be argued that the cutoff should correspond to the same size limit .",
    "in such a case the red sample should have a brighter cutoff due to its larger albedo , which decreases its fractional contribution .",
    "for example , adopting a 1.4 mag brighter cutoff ( see section 4.1.2 ) for the red asteroids ( = 20.1 instead of = 21.5 ) changes their fraction in the observed sample from 60% to 38% .",
    "we further discuss the number ratios of the two dominant asteroid types in the next two sections .",
    "the top panel in figure [ lfs ] shows the cumulative ( 1,0 ) distribution functions ( the total number of asteroids brighter than a given brightness limit ) for main belt asteroids .",
    "the symbols ( circles for asteroids with @xmath89 and triangles for asteroids with @xmath90 ) show the nonparametric estimate obtained by the @xmath142 method ( every asteroid contributes to the estimate and is represented by one symbol ) .",
    "the results for red asteroids are multiplied by 10 for clarity .",
    "the counts are re - normalized to correspond to the entire asteroid belt by assuming that the belt does not have any longitudinal structure . this assumption is well supported by the data because the counts of main belt asteroids observed in the spring and fall subsamples agree to within their poisson uncertainty ( 1% ) .",
    "the normalization is determined by the counts of asteroids with ( 1,0 ) @xmath2 15.3 , which is the faintest limit that is not affected by the apparent magnitude cutoff of the sample ( see figures [ figlfblue ] and [ figlfred ] ) .",
    "there are 337 blue and 519 red asteroids with ( 1,0 ) @xmath2 15.3 , corresponding to 18,000 blue and 27,700 red asteroids in the entire belt . the multiplication factor ( 53.4 )",
    "includes a factor of 2.03 to account for the @xmath64 cut ( see section 3.1 ) and the  uniqueness \" cut ( see section 3.3 ) , that decreased the initial sample of 10678 asteroids to the final sample of 5253 unique asteroids with reliable velocities . the remaining factor of 26.3 reflects the total area covered by the four scans analyzed here , that is , the data cover 3.8% of the ecliptic .",
    "the normalization uncertainty due to poisson errors is about 5% .",
    "an additional similar error in the normalization may be contributed by the uncertainty in the estimated heliocentric distance , another comparable term by the uncertainty of absolute photometric calibration ( @xmath149 mag ) , and yet another one by the uncertainty associated with defining a unique sample ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "thus , the overall normalization uncertainty is about 10% .",
    "since the blue and red asteroids have different albedo , a ( 1,0 ) limit does not correspond to the same size limit . to illustrate this difference , the two vertical lines close to ( 1,0 ) = 18 mark asteroid diameter of 1 km ; the cumulative counts are 370,000 for the blue type , and 160,000 for the red type .",
    "the normalization obtained here is somewhat lower than recent estimates by durda & dermott ( 1997 ) and jedicke & metcalfe ( 1998 ) .",
    "durda & dermott used the mcdonald survey and palomar - leiden survey data ( van houten _ et al .",
    "_ 1970 ) and found that the number of main - belt asteroids with @xmath150 ( absolute magnitude @xmath38 is based on the johnson v band , @xmath38-(1,0 ) 0.2 ) is 67,000 .",
    "jedicke & metcalfe used the spacewatch data and found a value of 120,000 .",
    "as discussed above , the sdss counts imply that there are 45,700 asteroids with @xmath150 , or about 1.5 times less than the former , and 2.6 less than the latter estimate .",
    "taking the various uncertainties into account , the normalization obtained in this work is marginally consistent with the results obtained by durda & dermott .",
    "we point out that the methods employed here to account for various selection effects are significantly simpler that those used in other determinations due to the homogeneity of the sdss data set .    the nonparametric estimate shows a change of slope around (",

    "their estimate corresponds to the total sample because they did not have color information .",
    "overall agreement between the two results is encouraging , given that the observing and debiasing methods are very different , and that they were forced to assume a mean asteroid albedo due to the lack of color information .",
    "our result indicates that the turn over at the faint end that they find is probably not real , while the sample discussed here does not have enough bright asteroids ( only 20 ) to judge the reality of the bump at the bright end .",

    "s2000 discuss two asteroids with very peculiar colors and warn that they may be blends with a background object .",
    "however , this explanation is probably not applicable for this asteroid because there are no optical nor infrared sources at the position of the 2mass detection . in principle",
    ", there could exist a very red and very variable source that was observed by 2mass , and was not detected in ukirt observation because it was in its faint phase .",
    "however , the probability for this seems very small .",
    "the kuiper belt objects ( kbos , sometimes known as trans - neptunian objects ) are an ancient reservoir of objects located beyond neptune s orbit , which are believed to be the origin of short - period comets ( fernndez 1980 , duncan , quinn & tremaine 1988 ; for a detailed review see jewitt 1999 ) .",
    "it is estimated that the number of the kbos larger than @xmath180 km in diameter ( assuming geometric albedo of 0.04 ) is @xmath181 in the @xmath182 to @xmath183 au distance range ( jewitt 1999 ) . the total mass in the kbos is thought to be somewhat less than one earth mass , and the expected sky density of the kbos brighter than @xmath184 21.5 mag is about 0.01 - 0.04 deg@xmath32 .",
    "the first kbo was detected by jewitt & luu ( 1992 ) , and today there are close to 300 known objects .",
    "most of these are very faint : a kbo with radius equal to @xmath0100 km and albedo 0.04 has a visual magnitude of 22 at a distance of @xmath030 au from the sun .",
    "finding such objects poses quite a challenging task ; to date detections have usually been accomplished by detecting their angular motion on the sky using large optical telescopes .",
    "as discussed in section 2.3 , the kbos move a bit too slowly to be detected in a single sdss run .",
    "however , they can be detected by comparing two scans of the same area , as long as they are obtained within a week ( otherwise a kbo would move to the region between two scanned columns ) .",
    "here we describe a method developed for finding kbos in two - epoch data and apply it to data for about 100 deg@xmath1 of sky observed twice @xmath0 1.9943 days apart ( runs 745 and 756 , see table 1 ) .",
    "the lower limit for detectable angular motion range is 0.0004 , and is set by a matching radius of 1 arcsec .",
    "the upper limit is determined by the maximum change in position for an object to be observed in both epochs and is about 0.08 . as the expected kbo motion is well within these limits ,",
    "the only practical constraint is the brightness .",
    "the lower limit on kbo size to be detected with @xmath185 during oposition at a heliocentric distance of 40 au is about 400 km ( assuming an albedo of 0.04 ) .",
    "slow moving objects like kbos can be detected in two - epoch data because at each of the two observed positions they will not have a positional match in the other epoch .",
    "the probability of a random association with a background object is very low because the sdss photometric pipeline deblends overlapping objects , unless they are too close to one another . assuming a lower limit of 2 arcsec for a pair of nearby sources to be deblended , only @xmath186 of potential kbos will be lost .",
    "the objects without positional counterparts in other epoch , hereafter called _ orphans _ , can then be matched within a much larger radius ( a few arcmin ) than the typical distance between two sdss sources ( @xmath0 30 arcsec for @xmath0 22 ) .",
    "of course , there will also be orphans caused by instrumental effects such as diffraction spikes , satellite trails , seeing dependent deblending , etc .",
    "in addition to these , main - belt asteroids may be considered as contaminants when searching for kbos .",
    "given a position of an orphan ( i.e. a kbo candidate ) in the first epoch , its position in the second epoch can be approximately predicted by assuming that the observed motion is due to earth reflex motion and its own keplerian proper motion .",
    "the predicted position depends on the time elapsed between the two observations , and object s unknown heliocentric distance and orbital inclination .",
    "because of the kbo s proper motion , the region in the second epoch where a matching orphan would be found is an ellipse for each possible heliocentric distance , with its major axis parallel to the ecliptic .",
    "assuming observations close to opposition , the distance parallel to the ecliptic between the center of this ellipse and the first position is where @xmath187 is the elapsed time in days , and is determined by the earth s reflex motion .",
    "the major axis of this ellipse is given by and its minor axis by an example of such ellipses for several different @xmath8 is shown in figure [ kbobox ] .",
    "since the distribution of possible distances is continuous 39 - 40 au and @xmath0 43 - 44 au , see jewitt 1999 . ] , the overall search region assumes a wedge - like shape as shown in figure [ kbobox ] .",
    "this shape is approximately described by    the pairs of orphans that are matched within such search box , determined for a range of plausible @xmath8 ( assumed to be 10 - 300 au ) , can still be spurious matches and we further require that each candidate pair of detections satisfy    1 .   no significant motion should be detected within a single run to avoid spurious matches with main - belt asteroids .",
    "2 .   both detections must be unresolved sources brighter than = 22 , and must not be blended ( objects with more than one peak ) or saturated , nor cosmic rays .",
    "the measured  and  colors for the two epochs must agree within 1@xmath30 ( the agreement between the two sets of magnitudes is not required because the brightness could vary if the object has irregular shape and rotates ) .",
    "we searched 99.5 deg@xmath1 of sky observed twice 1.9943 days apart ( runs 745 and 756 , see table 1 ) using the algorithm described in the previous section .",
    "the application of the first two criteria results in 166 candidate pairs , which are reduced to only 6 candidates by the application of the color constraint .",
    "we inspected visually 24 images corresponding to these 6 candidates and found that five candidates can be excluded as instrumental effects .",
    "the 4 images for the sixth candidate are shown in figures [ kbo1 ] and [ kbo2 ] .",
    "the measured parameters for this kbo candidate are listed in table 6 , and the derived properties are listed in table 7 .",
    "note that the magnitudes are the same within the measurement uncertainty , although this was not required by the algorithm , indicating that this object may have quite a regular shape .",
    "the candidate s distance is obtained from its angular motion ; it is multi - valued because the two - epoch data are insufficient to fully constrain the candidate s orbital parameters . the ambiguity in distance propagates to the ambiguity in size .",
    "we use the photometric transformations listed by fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to translate the kbo colors measured by other groups ( luu & jewitt 1996 ; tegler & romanishin 1998 ) to the sdss photometric system .",
    "we find that typical kbo colors are @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the colors of the sdss kbo candidate ( 1.0 , 0.5 ) fall within these ranges . as noted earlier , these colors are significantly redder than the colors of main - belt asteroids .",
    "the search for kbos is also sensitive to centaurs , but we did not find any reliable candidates in the searched area .",
    "the third search criterion described above requires that the  and colors must agree within 1@xmath30 between the two observations , and decreases the number of candidates from 166 to 6 .",
    "if this criterion is too conservative , then the number of detected kbos could be 28 times higher .",
    "we have tested this possibility by removing the third criterion and instead requiring that the observed  color falls in the range 0.7 - 1.2 in both epochs ( the left edge is 0.2 redder than discussed above due to the large increase in the number of stars with bluer colors ) .",
    "we also abandon any requirement on the orbit and simply match the orphans with required colors ( 120 and 300 from runs 745 and 756 , respectively ) within a circle with radius of 220 arcsec ( corresponding to the motion of 0.03 deg day@xmath9 ) .",
    "we selected only one other candidate , and by visual inspection of images found that it was an instrumental effect .",
    "thus we conclude that it is highly unlikely that our searching method missed any kbos present in the data .",
    "it is not easy to precisely estimate this probability , but assuming that the most likely cause would be blending with another source , we place an approximate upper limit of 0.001 on the probability that there is another kbo which the search algorithm missed .",
    "one detected source brighter than = 22 in 99.5 deg@xmath1 is in agreement with expected density of 0.01 - 0.04 such objects per deg@xmath1 ( jewit 1999 ) .",
    "the significance of this result is limited by the small - number statistics .",
    "the detection of asteroids discussed in this work is based on a new algorithm , and thus it is of concern whether these sources really are asteroids . based on the analysis presented here ,",
    "the main arguments in favor of the reality of the sdss detections are :    * visual inspection .",
    "but yet they move . *",
    "the density of selected candidates correlates with the ecliptic latitude , although the position of the ecliptic is not known to the algorithm , and the ecliptic latitude distribution width is consistent with observed distribution of known asteroids ( see sections 2.3 and 4.2.1 ) . *",
    "the color distribution of the selected candidates spans a much smaller range than that of stars , and corresponds to a g type star .",
    "furthermore , it matches the colors of known asteroids observed with sdss filters , and agrees with the synthetic colors derived from spectral data ( see section 4.1 ) . *",
    "the morphology of the velocity distribution for the selected candidates is in close agreement with the known orbital distribution of asteroids ( see section 5.1 ) . * for a limited area we show that the majority of candidates are recovered in a repeated scan ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the results presented here show that there are 530,000 objects larger than 1 km in the asteroid belt .",
    "this is about four times less than the previous estimates , e.g. the sirtf planning for observing solar system bodies assumes that there are as many as @xmath190 asteroids larger than 1 km ( see figure 4 in hanner & cruikshank 1999 ) .",
    "as discussed in section 6.6 , about half of that discrepancy can be attributed to different normalizations , and the other half is probably due to smaller number of asteroids in the previously unexplored 15 km diameter range .    extrapolating the observed asteroid density to the whole survey",
    ", we predict that by its completion sdss will obtain about 100,000 near simultaneous five - color measurements for a subset drawn from 280,000 asteroids brighter than r @xmath2 21.5 at opposition .",
    "while it is certain that a fraction of these observations will be multiple measurements of the same objects , the fraction can not be estimated beforehand because it depends on the detailed observing strategy .",
    "[ [ the - colors - of - asteroids - and - the - heliocentric - distance - distribution ] ]   the colors of asteroids and the heliocentric distance distribution ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the color distribution of observed asteroids is strongly bimodal . while there is evidence for the existence of additional classes ( see sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 ) , more than 98% of the objects in the sample have colors consistent with a simple separation into two basic color types . we find a significant correlation between asteroid colors and heliocentric distance , suggesting the existence of two distinct asteroid belts : the inner rocky belt , about 1 au wide ( fwhm ) and centered at @xmath8 2.8 au , and the outer carbonaceous belt , about 0.5 au wide and centered at @xmath8 3.2 au ( see sections 5.3 and 6.5 ) .",
    "this result represents a significant constraint for the theories of solar system formation ( e.g. ruzmaikina _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) .",
    "the correlation between the asteroid colors and their heliocentric distance has been recognized since the earliest development of taxonomies ( for a historical overview see gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 ) . the first evidence that various taxonomic types show distinct heliocentric distributions was presented by chapman , morrison & zellner ( 1975 ) and later reinforced by using larger samples ( gradie & tedesco 1982 , zellner , tholen & tedesco 1985 ) .",
    "this study , which represents an increase in the sample size by more than a factor of 10 , confirms that the number of red main belt asteroids decreases , and the number of blue main belt asteroids increases with the heliocentric distance . for samples defined by the same absolute magnitude cutoff ,",
    "the number fraction of the red to blue asteroids varies from 4:1 at @xmath8 2 au , to about 1:3 at @xmath8 3.5 au . for sample defined by the same size cutoff ,",
    "the number fraction of the red to blue asteroids is 1:2.3 for @xmath10 km ( this ratio slightly depends on the size cutoff due to different size distributions ) .",
    "our study has shown in addition that the surface number density of each type has a well defined maximum in the radial direction , and that the median color of each subsample becomes systematically bluer as the heliocentric distance increases .",
    "the colors of hungarias , mars crossers , and near - earth objects are more similar to the c - type than to s - type asteroids , suggesting that they originate in the outer belt . however , there are less than 50 objects in this sample and thus a larger data set is needed for a robust conclusion .",
    "we investigated the possibility that optical surveys are biased against very red asteroids by positionally matching the sdss and 2mass surveys . while we find one example of an asteroid with peculiar colors , there is no evidence for a significant fraction of very red asteroids ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the size distribution discussed in section 6.6 shows a striking change of the power - law index from 4 to 2.3 around @xmath355 km for both asteroid types .",
    "the steep slope applies up to the sample limit at @xmath3540 km , and the shallow slope down to @xmath350.4 km .",
    "the dynamic range of 100 is the largest one obtained with a single data set .    in the first detailed study of the asteroid size distribution , zellner ( 1979 )",
    "found the power - law index @xmath192 for asteroids larger than @xmath0 20 km , corresponding to @xmath193 where the counts analyzed in this study are limited by small - number statistics .",
    "thus , our results are not in direct conflict with those obtained by zellner , and may be considered the extension of the size distribution to smaller asteroid sizes . while it is conspicuous that the change from zellner s shallower size distribution to the steeper one obtained here occurs at the magnitude where the data samples barely overlap , the flattening of the size distribution for @xmath194  km is supported by more recent determinations . using a sample of about 4000 asteroids , cellino _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) found that the asteroid size distribution resembles a power law with index @xmath195 for @xmath196  km , and becomes flatter for smaller sizes ( @xmath197 ) , down to their sample size limit of 44 km .",
    "the results presented here are roughly consistent with a recent result for the absolute magnitude distribution by jedicke & metcalfe ( 1998 ) ( shown as open circles in the bottom panel in figure [ sizedist ] ) .",
    "a most notable difference in the region of overlap is that we do not detect the turn - over in the counts at the faint end ( we detect about 2 - 3 times more objects in the relevant range of magnitudes , ( 1,0 ) 16 - 17 , or @xmath6 19 ) .",
    "it may be of interest to note that the size distribution for kbos larger than @xmath0100 km seems to follow the @xmath5 power law ( jewitt 1999 ) , while the size distribution of comets appears to follow the @xmath198 power law ( shoemaker & wolfe 1982 ) .",
    "the simulations of the asteroid belt evolution predict slopes similar to those detected here which range from 2.5 to 4.0 ( gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 ) , depending on detailed assumptions and modelled effects .",
    "for example , the @xmath199 power law is expected to be produced by shattering collisions ( dohnanyi 1969 , williams & wetherill 1994 ) .",
    "the jedicke & metcalfe result for the absolute magnitude distribution was transformed into a size distribution and modeled by durda , greenberg & jedicke ( 1998 ) .",
    "they join the resulting distribution with the data for catalogued asteroids and find two  humps \" : the first spans the range 30 - 300 km and the second spans the range 3 - 30 km ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "these  humps \" were explained by tailoring a detailed dependence of the critical specific energy ( energy per unit mass required to fragment an asteroid and disperse the fragments to infinity ) on asteroid size .",
    "the size distributions derived here and shown in figure [ sigmar ] are smooth , and apart from the change in slope around d 5 km , do not show any structure .",
    "the discrepancies in the region of overlap with studies quoted above are probably due to different methods of correcting for selection effects .",
    "they were forced to assume a mean albedo due to the lack of color information , a problem that is alleviated by sdss data .",
    "due to significant differences in the mean albedo and radial density distribution of the two classes , this assumption may lead to biases , as was already pointed out in those studies .",
    "the same explanation can be invoked to account for the fact that , contrary to previous studies ( e.g. jedicke & metcalfe 1998 ) , we find no evidence that the size distribution varies with the heliocentric distance .",
    "the sdss data indicate that the size distribution of main belt asteroids is well described by a @xmath5 power - law for 5 km @xmath4 40 km , and by a @xmath3 power - law for 0.4 km @xmath4 5 km .",
    "similar broken power laws have already been proposed for the size distribution of various solar system objects ( e.g. levison & duncan 1990 , tremaine 1990 ) , and in particular for the main - belt distribution ( cellino _ et al .",
    "while we do nt yet have an understanding of the processes responsible for the observed change of slope of size distribution from 4 to 2.3 , it seems plausible that they could be modeled as in e.g. durda , greenberg & jedicke ( 1998 ) .",
    "a decrease by a factor of 4 in the estimated number of asteroids with @xmath10  km discussed here implies a similar decrease in estimates of various other quantities proportional to the number of asteroids , e.g. the contamination rate by asteroids when searching for stellar occultations by kbos ( c. alcock , priv . comm . ) , and the frequency of `` killer asteroids '' , usually defined as objects larger than 1 km .",
    "the results presented here imply that the time until the next catastrophic asteroid collision with the earth may be at least four times longer than previously thought ( estimated to be @xmath200 years for objects larger than 1 km , see e.g. spaceguard survey workshop report , verschuur 1991 , steel 1997 , ceplecha _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , rabinowitz _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) .",
    "of course , the estimates of such impact rates based on the number of asteroids and dynamical considerations are rather uncertain , so it may be more robust to determine them from the historical impact records . on the other hand , the latter method suffers greatly from the small number statistics and unknown sample completeness .",
    "the only known catastrophic event with a reliable estimate of the object size is the impact of a 10@xmath1234 km body that probably caused the extinction of dinosaurs 65@xmath1230.1 million years ago ( alvarez _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 , van den bergh 1994 ) . tying this impact rate ( 1 per 10@xmath201 years for objects larger than 10 km ) to the impact rate for objects larger than 1 km that are capable of causing global catastrophes , was until now based on the extrapolations of the size distribution .",
    "sdss measurements for the first time reliably show that the number ratio of @xmath202 1 km asteroids and @xmath202 10 km asteroids is about 100 , implying an impact rate for `` killer asteroids '' of about 1 every 10@xmath203 years , or at least several times less frequently than previous estimates .",
    "while still dependent on rather uncertain normalization , this estimate no longer relies on the extrapolation of the asteroid size distribution .",
    "figure [ impacts ] shows that such an extrapolation overestimates the number of @xmath202 1 km asteroids by about a factor of 10 .",
    "this work analyzes only 10% of the total number of asteroids to be observed by sdss .",
    "although this sample represents more than an order of magnitude increase in the number of asteroids with accurate multi - color photometry , another increase by factor of ten will be possible soon . with such massive and detailed information ,",
    "it may be possible to develop a more sophisticated taxonomic scheme than attempted here , as well as to perform other types of studies ; for example detailed modeling of the dependence of color on phase angle .",
    "the main shortcoming of sdss data for asteroid studies is insufficient information to determine orbits .",
    "although the completeness of the catalogued asteroids is significant only at the bright end of the sdss sample , the matching of known asteroids to sdss observations would increase the sample of objects with both known orbits and accurate multi - color photometry by at least an order of magnitude .",

    "the observed angular velocity is where the semi - major axis and heliocentric distance are related by where @xmath222 is the true anomaly , which specifies the orientation of the orbit relative to the observer .",
    "two limiting cases are perihelion ( @xmath223 ) and aphelion ( @xmath224 ) . for fixed @xmath205 and @xmath221 ,",
    "the observation in perihelion corresponds to the smallest @xmath8 and the largest @xmath225 , while the opposite is true for observation in aphelion .",
    "the changes of @xmath205 and @xmath8 have opposite effects on @xmath65 ( note that @xmath226 ) , and this compensation results in a very minor dependence of @xmath65 on unknown @xmath222 .",
    "we find that for the relevant range of parameters ( 2.2 @xmath227 3.2 , @xmath228 ) the change of @xmath65 is @xmath229 when @xmath222 is varied from @xmath230 to 180@xmath46 . or equivalently , for a fixed ( i.e. measured ) @xmath65 , the uncertainty of @xmath205 is about 3% due to nonzero eccentricity ( as found empirically ) . note that even if the eccentricity were known ( and nonzero , of course ) , this uncertainty would not be smaller because the problem is in unknown @xmath222 .",
    "similarly , the larger uncertainty in @xmath8 is the result of random orientations of eccentric asteroid orbits . even if all asteroid orbits had identical _ known _ eccentricity , the resulting uncertainty would be similar because the heliocentric distance can be anywhere between @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
