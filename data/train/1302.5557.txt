    "much recent work has raised the interest in fundamental questions on energy transport and heat flow at the nanoscopic scale where quantum effects become dominant.@xcite mesoscopic conductors are particularly suitable for investigations of nonequilibrium phenomena in quantum systems since electron transport can be created , manipulated and detected thanks to the use of electric biases or thermal gradients applied to electronic terminals coupled to the mesoscopic sample . in this way , thermovoltages generated in response to a temperature difference have been observed in quantum point contacts,@xcite quantum dots@xcite and ballistic microjunctions.@xcite these experiments can be successfully explained using linear - response theoretical models.@xcite much more scarce are contributions that explore the nonlinear regime of transport.@xcite we have recently proposed in ref .   a general scattering theory of transport for mesoscopic _ thermoelectric _ effects in the weakly nonlinear regime taking into account screening interactions out of equilibrium .",
    "a natural development of our theory would aim at considering nonlinear effects in the _ heat _ current flowing through a mesoscopic system .",
    "this is the goal of the present work .",
    "heat currents can be driven by electric voltages or temperature differences . in the former case",
    ", a heat transfer accompanies an electric current , which in the limit of low voltage gives rise to the peltier effect ; in the latter case , a thermal gradient produces a heat flux , which in the limit of small temperature differences is well described by the fourier law .",
    "nonlinear effects in mesoscopic systems demand the application of large driving forces across small distances , a requirement within the scope of today s techniques.@xcite nonlinearities have been predicted to cause thermal rectification effects @xcite and low temperature cooling.@xcite a deep understanding of nonlinear effects is also needed for a careful assessment of the device performance of heat engines@xcite , heat pumps@xcite and multiterminal heat - to - electric current converters.@xcite     and @xmath0 and thermal differences @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "the linear response coefficients depend on the electrostatic potential at equilibrium only .",
    "higher order terms in the expansion define weakly nonlinear transport coefficients that are functions of the potential landscape out of equilibrium.@xcite this dependence can not be neglected and is crucial to formulate a gauge - invariant theory.@xcite we determine the screening potential up to the first order in the driving forces.@xcite in the isothermal case , charge pile - up processes are governed by _",
    "particle injectivities_. importantly , these injectivities break the onsager symmetry under reversal of an external magnetic field,@xcite which has been confirmed experimentally.@xcite in the isoelectric case , charge can be injected to or from the system depending on whether the carrier s energy lies above or below the chemical potential .",
    "thus , we define _",

    ", the transmission function becomes a function of energy , voltage and temperature shifts.@xcite below , we discuss the consequences of this important result for the nonlinear regime of heat transport .",
    "we examine two applications of our theory .",
    "first , we consider nonlinear contributions to the peltier coefficient .",
    "strikingly enough , there are very few works devoted to the peltier effect beyond linear response .",
    "exceptions are ref .   on metallic constrictions , ref .   on quantum point contacts and ref",
    ".   on bulk semiconductors",
    "we consider a quantum dot attached to two terminals and calculate self - consistently the peltier coefficient for higher - order currents .",
    "interestingly , we find that the weakly nonlinear contributions are expressed in terms of a ratio difference that quantifies the relative importance of the nonlinear conductances with respect to the linear ones . additionally , we test our analytical results with numerical calculations of the full model .",
    "second , we examine departures of the wiedemann - franz law out of equilibrium .",
    "we recall that this rule establishes a proportionality relationship between the linear thermal and electric conductances and that the proportionality factor , the lorenz number , depends on universal physical constants only . naturally , the wiedemann - franz law is not valid outside the sommerfeld theory of metals ( noninteracting electrons and linear - response regime ) , although it has been empirically found to be satisfied in bulk metals within a wide range of temperatures .",
    "violations of this law in mesoscopic systems have been investigated in artificial kondo impurities,@xcite in the fluctuating dynamics of open quantum dots,@xcite in single - electron transistors,@xcite in strongly interacting dots coupled to ferromagnetic leads@xcite and in double quantum dots.@xcite here , we discuss deviations from the wiedemann - franz law that emerge in the nonlinear regime of transport only .",
    "we find that these departures become maximal when the distance between the fermi energy and the dot level is of the order of the level broadening because in that case the dot transmission energy dependence becomes strongest .",
    "our system consists of a mesoscopic conductor attached to multiple terminals @xmath7 .",
    "each terminal is electrically and thermally biased as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , @xmath10 being the electrochemical potential , @xmath11 the fermi energy , @xmath12 the temperature of lead @xmath13 and @xmath14 the background temperature .",
    "charge and heat transport is completely characterized by the scattering matrix @xmath15 . generally , the scattering matrix depends on the carrier energy @xmath16 and the electrostatic potential inside the sample @xmath6.@xcite the internal potential @xmath17 is a function of the position @xmath18 and the set of applied voltages @xmath19 and temperature gradients @xmath20.@xcite therefore , a complete calculation of @xmath21 as a function of the full potential landscape @xmath6 in the presence of interactions out of equilibrium seems an insurmountable task .",
    "we will then focus on the weakly nonlinear transport regime for which the transport coefficients and the system s response can be expressed in terms of quantities evaluated at equilibrium.@xcite    we denote with @xmath22 and @xmath23 the charge and heat currents , respectively , that flow from the leads toward the sample : @xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26})$ ] is the fermi distribution function in reservoir @xmath27 .",

    "the energy current is conserved@xcite since unitarity of the scattering matrix ( @xmath30 ) dictates that @xmath31 .",
    "heat fluxes thus satisfy the sum rule @xmath32 .",
    "equations and are exact within the scattering approach , now , in the weakly nonlinear transport regime charge and heat currents can be expanded around the equilibrium state ( defined with @xmath33 and @xmath34 for all @xmath13 ) up to second order in powers of the driving fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 the linear - response electric conductance is given by , @xmath38\\,.\\ ] ] at very low temperature , the sommerfeld expansion to leading order in @xmath39 yields the simple expression @xmath40 .",

    "indeed , this dependence is responsible for rectification effects in both , electrical and heat currents .",

    "notably , the nonlinear responses depend not only on @xmath53 but also on its change with variations of the set of electrical and thermal shifts @xmath54 due to the screening response of the system .    a reasonable model for the interactions as response to the electrical and thermal biases considers only small deviations away from equilibrium .",
    "hence , the internal potential is expanded as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the characteristic potentials .",
    "these potential susceptibilities are measures of the internal reaction of the conductor in response to an electrical and thermal shift applied to contact @xmath13 . for definiteness , we next consider the case of a homogeneous potential profile independent of the position , although we emphasize that the extension to inhomogeneous fields in our general model is straightforward .",

    "the latter corresponds to the charge that builds up inside the conductor in response to the injected charges.@xcite the bare charge @xmath59 injected from lead @xmath13 originates from a voltage and a temperature imbalance in that terminal .",

    "we also note that in eq .",
    "we write @xmath11 instead of the chemical potential @xmath65 , which is in general temperature dependent if the reservoir s charge density is assumed to be fixed.@xcite however , in experimentally relevant situations one externally fixes the electrochemical potential using , e.g. , voltage sources .",
    "obviously , @xmath66 in the limit of very low temperatures .",
    "finally , the total accumulation or depletion bare charge imbalance becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and @xmath69 represent the integrated particle and entropic injectivities around the fermi energy .",
