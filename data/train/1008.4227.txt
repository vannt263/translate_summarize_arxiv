    "spin glass models defined on finite - connectivity random graphs have two control parameters , one is the temperature @xmath4 and the other is the interaction ( or constraint ) density , defined as the number @xmath5 of interactions ( constraints ) versus the number @xmath6 of vertices , @xmath7 .",
    "theoretical work of the last ten years @xcite have established the understanding that , a random spin glass system with many - body interactions will experience a clustering transition if either the temperature @xmath4 is lowered below certain threshold value or the constraint density @xmath8 is increased beyond certain threshold value . at the clustering transition ,",
    "the configuration space of the system splits into an exponential number of gibbs pure states and ergodicity is broken .",

    "whether they are also valid in @xmath9-dimensional real - world spin glass systems ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) is still a debated open issue .",
    "although the configuration space geometric properties of random finite - connectivity spin glass models at or after the clustering transition have been well characterized by statistical physics methods , much less is known about the configuration space structure just before the clustering transition .",
    "why do an exponential number of gibbs states suddenly appear at the clustering transition ? are they preceded by precursor structures in the ergodic phase of the configuration space ? if yes , when do the gibbs - state precursors start to form and how to describe their evolution ? what are the impacts of these precursor structures to the equilibrium dynamical properties of the system ?",
    "these questions are important for a full understanding of the structural evolution of the configuration space .    in this paper , as a continuation of our recent efforts @xcite , we study the fine structure of the configuration space of random finite - connectivity spin glass models in the vicinity of the clustering transition .",

    "each configuration community is a collection of relatively similar configurations and it forms a stable thermodynamic phase in the presence of a suitable external field ; they are the precursors for the gibbs states at the clustering transition .",
