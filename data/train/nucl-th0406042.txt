    "these plots indicate that the scattering equivalence also has significant effects on the excited mesons states with the same quantum numbers .",
    "the form factors in the original and transformed models cross at about 1 @xmath63 .",

    "different choices of @xmath3 lead to different predictions for the form factors of the excited states .    the effect of the transformation @xmath3 is to add an additional short range structure to the original confining interaction . compared to the original carlson , kogut , and pandharipande interaction ,",
