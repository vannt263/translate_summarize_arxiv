    "1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene ( tpb ) is used as a wavelength shifter in many experiments .",
    "for example , tpb is used in numerous liquid argon ( lar ) experiments including icarus @xcite , warp @xcite , miniclean @xcite , deap @xcite and microboone @xcite to shift scintillation light , which is produced at 128 nm in lar , to the visible , where it can be detected by photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "tpb absorbs light across a broad range from the high uv to its emission peak , which lies at approximately @xmath0 nm .    tpb has the chemical formula ( c@xmath1h@xmath2)@xmath3c = chch = c(c@xmath1h@xmath2)@xmath3 .",
    "scintillation - grade tpb , which is used in lar experiments , has an assay of @xmath4 purity .",
    "tpb dissolves in toluene , and this mixture is often used when coating surfaces such as pmts .",
    "one can spray or paint the tpb - toluene mixture onto the surface and allow the toluene to evaporate , leaving only a layer of tpb behind .",
    "alternatively , one can dissolve polystyrene into the mix to produce a thin plastic skin with embedded tpb when the toluene evaporates .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the tpb fluorescence response degrades over time when the chemical is exposed to light .",
    "this is relevant to the handling of the tpb - coated materials as experiments are assembled .",
    "all studies used samples of 0.25 g of tpb dissolved in 100 ml of toluene . we found that tests using dissolved mixtures in a cuvette , as opposed to tests of tpb powder in a cuvette , gave a more repeatable measured response when the sample was removed and replaced in the test - stand spectrometer    we studied two grades of tpb : scintillation grade tpb ( sg - tpb ) and 99% pure tpb . for consistency in the studies over time ,",
    "all samples of a given grade were taken from the same batch of tpb powder purchased form sigma - aldrich @xcite . in our studies of freshly mixed samples , we also report on results of tpb powder purchased from acros @xcite .",
    "all tpb powder batches were kept in opaque brown bottles in a dark cabinet throughout the study .    for studies of exposure to light , tpb - toluene mixtures were stored in clear glass bottles .",
    "these were illuminated by a solux solar spectrum lamp @xcite for periods of three months and one month .",
    "the samples were maintained at room temperature during the exposure to the solux light .",
    "a diagram of the setup for the measurements .",
    "the light source illuminates the cuvette .",
    "the light may be transmitted or absorbed and re - emitted at a longer wavelength .",
    "the spectrometer measures the wavelength of light which exits the back of the cuvette.,title=\"fig:\",height=297 ]    the experimental setup used to measure the fluorescence of the tpb - toluene samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the samples were held in a cuvette with ( 1 cm)@xmath5 cross section , which was illuminated by a 384-nm light source .",
    "this particular wavelength transmits through toluene , which absorbs uv light with @xmath6315 nm wavelength@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "384 nm is within the absorption range of tpb .",
    "the fluorescence spectrum from the samples is piped to a spectrometer via a fiber coupled to the back of the cuvette .",
    "we use a stellarnet black comet ( model c ) spectrometer @xcite .",
    "this is a concave grating spectrometer with a range from 190 to 850 nm .",
    "solid : the light source as observed through the empty cuvette .",
    "dashed : the light source observed through a cuvette filled with toluene .",
    "the broad toluene peak , centered at about 550 nm can be seen .",
    "the peak from the light source , which is at 384 nm , is truncated so that the toluene peak is visible.,title=\"fig:\",height=297 ]    fig .",
    "[ base ] ( solid ) shows the peak of the 384 nm light source as observed through the empty spectrometer cuvette , while fig .",
    "[ base ] ( dashed ) shows the spectrometer measurement when the cuvette is filled with pure toluene .",
    "one can see that the toluene produces a broad peak centered at about 550 nm .",
    "the stability of the height of the toluene peak provides a useful benchmark for our study .",
    "we do not expect the toluene fluorescence peak to substantially change with exposure to light , and so this peak provides a method to normalize the absolute light measurements , which can vary with minor changes of the alignment of the light source to the spectrometer .",
    "[ immediate ] shows the resulting spectrum from a cuvette filled with freshly - mixed sg - tpb  toluene solution .",
    "the light from the source is absorbed by the tpb , and so there is no visible peak at 384 nm .",
    "one can see a strong peak at 425 nm from the tpb and the broad peak from the toluene .",
    "this curve provides a basis of comparison for other samples in this study .",
    "when normalizing to the toluene peak at 550 nm , we observed that the peaks of freshly - mixed samples of the same tpb batch vary from lowest to highest counts by 10% .",
    "we present this below as a @xmath7 systematic error on the measurement .",
    "we believe this is consistent with the expected combined error of the measurement of the mass of tpb powder and the toluene volume during mixing .",
    "as noted above , we also provide a comparison of the sg - tpb response to 99% pure tpb , which is generally considered poor for use as a wavelength shifter , but which is also less expensive . during this phase of the study",
    ", we observed a striking effect .",

    "[ sg99 ] ( top ) solid and dashed lines , respectively . from this , we conclude that the light output from 99% pure tpb is reduced compared to sg - tpb , as expected .    we observed that the 99% pure tpb - toluene mixture suffered yellowing with exposure to sunlight , ambient room light , and also to the solux lamp light .",
    "this effect was observed in three separately acquired batches of 99% pure tpb ordered months apart .",

    "after a period of about three days , the mixture in the light showed clear yellowing while the mixture stored in the dark looked clear .",
    "the latter mixture was removed from the cupboard and set into the light .",
    "after about three days of exposure , yellowing appeared .",
    "we have investigated the fluorescence response of tpb dissolved in toluene .",
    "we studied the effect of exposure to light for extended periods and conclude that within the level of @xmath8 systematic variations , the scintillation grade tpb is stable to exposure to light .",
    "this would indicate that tpb - coated equipment does not require special protection from light .",
    "we compared three batches of scintillation - grade tpb and found that the relative response agreed within the systematic error .",
    "we also showed that scintillation - grade tpb has superior response compared to 99% pure tpb .",
    "the 99% pure tpb showed yellowing upon exposure to light over a period of several days . at this point , we do not know the cause of the yellowing .",
    "it appears to be an impurity in the tpb which reacts when exposed to light .",
    "while we have not observed yellowing in the three scintillation - grade batches we studied , there was a report from warp of one scintillation - grade batch which showed yellowing which may be the same effect .",
    "because the initial mixture appears clear , with yellowing occurring over several days , we recommend that all batches of tpb , even those which are scintillation grade , be tested for this effect before use .",
    "a simple test is to place a small amount of the tpb powder from each batch into a petri dish and expose it to light for one week before use .",
    "batches which show yellowing should be rejected .",
