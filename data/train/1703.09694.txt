    "it so turns out that although transmission @xmath81 differs in @xmath50 and @xmath51 valley , when integrated over @xmath82 this differences disappear .",
    "thus total conductance @xmath83 is the twice that of @xmath50 valley conductance .",
    "our aim as defined in the introduction was to design an efficient qhe operating at maximum power via strained graphene .",
    "the generated power should be comparable to or better than other qhe s based on quantum hall effect@xcite , chaotic cavities@xcite , etc . to generate maximum power the system should have a large seeback coefficient ( @xmath84 ) with a large electrical conductance ( @xmath83 ) , as power is proportional to the @xmath85 , see eq .",
    "( [ pmax ] ) .",
    "increasing strain reduces the electrical conductance , see fig .  2 , but increases the seeback coefficient , as in fig .",
    "3 . as strain increases the transmittance of electrons through strained graphene decreases , thus reducing the electrical conductance . from fig .  2",
    ", we see that increasing strain opens a gap in the conduction , not a band gap , it is due to the shift of the dirac cones by the strain in the brillouin zone .",
    "a real energy band gap opens for a strain beyond 20 percent ( 540 mev ) in pristine graphene @xcite , so we will restrict ourselves only to a maximum of 15 percent strain ( 400 mev ) . a sign change seen in fig .",
    "3 , for the seeback co - efficient near the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) , is due to switching between hole and electron carriers .",
    "the first peak , close to the cnp , is due to the imbalance between electron and hole contributions to the thermo - electric co - efficient @xmath86 , and is present even at zero strain .",
    "this peak dies at a distance from the cnp .",
    "the origin of the second peak in the seeback co - efficient ( blue line in fig .",
    "3 ) is due to the applied strain . as a result of this strain",
    ", transmission becomes a function of the fermi energy and gives rise to a large seeback co - efficient , which leads to large power with finite efficiency .    at lower levels of strain ( @xmath87 mev )",
    "our proposed qhe can exhibit maximum power , i.e. , 0.2 @xmath88 pico watt at 30 k for 40 nm strained region , with @xmath89 , see figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "this is more than what is seen in two and three terminal quantum hall heat engines operating at maximum power@xcite .",
    "the efficiency at maximum power @xmath90 is @xmath91 , which is also good enough as compared to the other qhe s , see fig .  6 .",
    "efficiency at maximum power can also be raised to more than 0.4 @xmath37 , as in fig .  7 , but then maximum power @xmath92 reduces to less than 0.03 @xmath93 .",
    "this is because maximum power generated in the qhe depends on both seeback co - efficient and electrical conductance , see eq .",
    "( [ pmax ] ) , and these two factors so conspire to reduce the maximum power .",
    "however , the overall efficiency at maximum power again though dependent on seeback co - efficient ( @xmath84 ) , conductance @xmath83 and thermal conductane @xmath30 , effectively increases with increasing strain , see fig .",
    "7 . individually ,",
    "seeback co - efficient increases with increasing strain , while for @xmath83 and @xmath30 it is the opposite .",
    "although , the maximum efficiency @xmath90 and maximum power @xmath92 generated for this system are better than comparable qhe s proposed , the dimension of the considered heat engines , as in the figs .  2 - 7 , is large ( @xmath94 @xmath95 ) .",
    "an effective qhe should deliver high power with high efficiency and its dimensions should be as small as possible , so that in less area more number of nano heat engines can be fabricated , and thus total generated power would be large . from fig .",
    "8(a ) , we see that with increasing strain(150mev ) but decreasing the length ( @xmath96 ) of the strained region , massive power can be generated at high efficiency . the performance of the heat engine can be increased further by tuning one more variable , the fermi velocity @xmath58 .",
    "we have considered the fermi velocity of dirac electrons to be equal to @xmath97 m/s , but increasing strain reduces@xcite the fermi velocity to around @xmath98 m/s , the performance of the qhe can thus increase further , such that the maximum power as well as efficiency at maximum power both are enhanced to values as high as 0.28 @xmath93 and 0.1@xmath37 respectively , see fig .",
    "this can be understood better , if a 1@xmath99 area is occupied by our proposed nanoscale qhe s in parallel , then 0.06 watts total power can be generated with an efficiency of 0.1 @xmath37 , which is better than quantum hall heat engines , see table 1 .    increasing temperature , seeback coefficient and electrical conductance both can be increased to a large value with a maximum power more than 0.2@xmath93 ( at @xmath100 m / s ) and efficiency at maximum power also more than @xmath91 .",
    "but then the phonon contribution to the thermal conductivity comes into play and that increases the thermal conductivity , implying a reduction in zt , thermodynamic figure of merit .",
    "this in turn reduces the efficiency at maximum power , though it does not affect the power of the qhe .",
    "we do not consider the phonon contribution , hence in our calculations and figures plotted have restricted ourselves to an upper limit for temperature of 30k , at which the phonon contribution can be safely neglected @xcite .",
    ".how does the strained graphene qhe compare with related proposals ? [ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "finally we discuss the use of our model as a quantum refrigerator . as in our model external magnetic field",
    "is absent , so time - reversal symmetry ( tr ) is not broken .",
    "the co - efficient of performance of the refrigerator is defined by the ratio of heat current extracted from the hot reservoir to the electrical power @xmath101 , such as - @xmath102 which is maximum , considering @xmath47 and @xmath103 , for - @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the efficiency of an ideal refrigerator . for the systems with broken tr symmetry",
    ", the upper bound of the refrigerator efficiency @xmath106 is always less than @xmath107 . for systems with conserved tr symmetry ,",
    "the asymmetric parameter @xmath108 becomes unity , and the upper bound of the corresponding maximum efficiency @xcite @xmath106 equals @xmath107 .",
    "this is the advantage of systems with conserved tr symmetry , that it can work as both heat engine as well as a refrigerator , but for systems with broken tr symmetry , they can only work as a heat engine .",
    "we show here that strain acting solely can act as a qhe with better performance characteristics like high efficiency than most other qhe like quantum hall heat engine , chaotic cavity qhe , etc .",
    "it has some advantage over magnetically driven qhe .",
    "application of magnetic field breaks the tr symmetry , which in turn reduces the performance of the system as a refrigerator . on the other hand",
    ", strain does not break tr symmetry , so our system can act as both heat engine as well as refrigerator @xcite . in table 1",
    "we compare efficiency @xmath90 , power @xmath92 and total power generated for some configured open qhe s .",
    "we see that our model system has excellent characteristics compared to other qhe s .",
    "this raises a question that perhaps large power and efficiency can also be found with different kind of strain patterns in multi - terminal graphene system , for which further investigations are needed .",
