    "electron transfer ( et ) is one of the most important elementary chemical processes.@xcite in many cases the simple picture of a direct transfer of an electron from the donor ( d ) to the acceptor ( a ) does not apply . instead , bridge ( b )",
    "molecules are involved . the standard expression for the et rate",
    "is based on the condon approximation , in which the dependence of the electronic coupling between d and a on the nuclear configuration is disregarded .",
    "however , molecules undergo structural fluctuations over a wide range of timescales at thermal equilibrium .",
    "if the b conformational changes influence the electronic coupling , the system will experience a breakdown of the condon approximation . in the limit of slow electronic coupling fluctuations ,",
    "the et rate can be expressed as the ensemble average of the instantaneous et rate over the static b configuration .",
    "this expression captures the structural averaging effect of the b conformation on the electronic coupling , while neglecting the coupling between nuclear and electron dynamics .",
    "the dynamical non - condon effects may become significant as the electronic coupling fluctuations occur on faster timescales .",
    "there have been theoretical developments and computational studies elucidating the dynamical non - condon effect on the et rate in the deep ( off - resonant ) tunneling regime where the energy of the initial electronic state is well separated from the eigenenergies of the b subspace.@xcite starting with the fermi s golden rule expression for the et rate , the dynamical effect is expressed in terms of the time autocorrelation function of the electronic coupling . in a quantum mechanical treatment , the electronic coupling is a hermitian operator , and its time autocorrelation function satisfies detailed balance .",
    "the calculation results in ref .",
    "show that for the models of independently coupled bridge modes with coupling of the tunneling electron to the bridge modes , the dynamical non - condon effects can result in substantial enhancement of the et rate in the activated inverted region . the detailed balance property is reflected in the asymmetry of the et rate with respect to the activation energy .",
    "on the other hand , the analogous classical time autocorrelation function is a real symmetric function of time and thus does not satisfy detailed balance .",
    "therefore , the classical approximation can not reproduce the asymmetry of the et rate due to the dynamical non - condon effects , but rather produces the symmetric correction to the et rate with respect to the activation energy , assuming the classical marcus expression for the franck - condon factor.@xcite the enhancement in the activated inverted region is much smaller than that in the quantum mechanical treatment . as pointed out in ref .  , it is possible to restore detailed balance in the way that the fourier transform of the classical time autocorrelation function is multiplied by a quantum correction factor .",
    "such semiclassical approximation schemes have been widely discussed over the years.@xcite    the computational studies have been carried out using classical equilibrium molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and quantum chemical ( qc ) calculations to evaluate the classical and semiclassical time autocorrelation functions of the electronic coupling.@xcite the results show that the characteristic timescales for the electronic coupling fluctuations are too slow for the dynamical non - condon effects to be significant . in the time domain ,",
    "a comparison between the decay times of the electronic coupling correlation function , and the time - dependent franck - condon factor reveals the extent to which dynamical non - condon effects influence the et rate .",
    "the decay time of the time - dependent franck - condon factor is typically @xmath1 fs.@xcite on the other hand , the decay time of the electronic coupling correlation function is more than a few tens of fs.@xcite therefore , the electronic coupling fluctuations are negligible on the timescale of the decay of the time - dependent franck - condon factor .",
    "a significantly short decay time of the electronic coupling correlation function was observed only when the electron tunneling energy was artificially brought into resonance with bridge - centered eigenstates.@xcite however , there has not ever been confirmation of this statement for a natural system in the resonant tunneling regime .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the timescale of the electronic coupling fluctuations and the possibility of the dynamical non - condon effects in the resonant tunneling regime through a computational study .",
    "we assume that transport is fully coherent , that is , the electron transfers from d to a in a single quantum mechanical process . in the resonant tunneling regime ,",
    "another contribution comes from sequential tunneling where an electron first tunnels into b and then , after losing its phase memory , tunnels out of b. the dynamical non - condon effects can substantially increase the contribution from the coherent tunneling , particularly if the b and a electronic states are off resonance .",
    "we will consider such situations .",
    "the choice of materials are largely motivated by the previous work for solvent - mediated et , where b is the solvent@xcite . instead of the c - clamp molecule , we use unlinked d - a systems . in fact , the curved saturated bridge in the c - clamp molecule plays an important role in keeping the distance between d and a. instead , in this work the d and a molecules are held fixed during the simulation . as an example of the resonant tunneling we consider the et from the lumo of naphthalene to the lumo of tetracyanoethylene ( tcne ) in benzonitrile ( phcn ) .",
    "this system lies in the highly activated inverted region ( experimental data available for the case of acetonitrile solvent@xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "if the electronic coupling fluctuations occur on timescale as short as the decay time of the time - dependent franck - condon factor , the dynamical non - condon effects may cause substantial enhancement of the et rate .",

    "we generalize the fermi s golden rule expression to include all high - order tunneling processes in the @xmath0-matrix framework .",
    "the time autocorrelation function of the electronic coupling is thereby replaced by a time correlation function of the @xmath0-matrix . in practice",
    "we will limit our calculations to a small part of a large system , while the effect of the surroundings on the relevant system will be included by broadening the energy levels of the system . in this case",

    "the deviation between the full @xmath0-matrix and the second - order perturbation results at small level broadening can be attributed to an underestimate of the level broadening for the initial electronic state , while the deviation at large level broadening can be attributed to an overestimate of the level broadening for the b states . in the latter case",
    "significant differences do not appear between the full @xmath0-matrix and the second - order perturbation calculations including the level broadening because they both involve the b states for which the large level broadening causes the error .",

    "[ fig8 ] the same data ( black line ) are shown in comparison with the second - order perturbation results with the level broadening ( gray line ) .",

    "the deviations in ( a ) can be explained by the large contributions from the other eigenstates due to the large level broadening . on the other hand ,",
