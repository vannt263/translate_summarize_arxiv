    "recently , it became apparent that the physics exposed in the addition spectra of quantum dots is rather rich , and hence its investigation is at the focus of both experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the present work concentrates on the distribution of spacings between coulomb blockade peaks in large semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "coulomb blockade is evidently one of the hallmarks of mesoscopic physics .",
    "the experimental achievement of tracing an addition of a single electron to a quantum dot and the appearance of isolated conductance peaks led to the concept of single electron transistors .",
    "after the origin of coulomb blockade peaks has been elucidated , investigation is directed toward more subtle questions like their heights , widths and spacings .",
    "the underlying physics is related to the ground state energy , chemical potential and inverse compressibility of a few electron islands coupled capacitively to its environment , as well as fluctuations of these quantities with the number @xmath1 of electrons on the dot .    as far as the distribution of spacings between adjacent coulomb blockade peaks is concerned",
    ", the question can be stated as follows : according to the simplest picture in which the quantum dot is regarded as a single electron island whose coupling with the leads is through its capacitance @xmath2 , the total potential energy of a quantum dot is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the corresponding gate voltage .",
    "the conductance peaks occur at those values of @xmath4 for which @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electron charge ( henceforth @xmath7 ) . for",
    "this value of @xmath4 the addition of an electron to the dot ( which contains @xmath1 electrons ) does not cost any charging energy .",
    "the position of the @xmath8 coulomb blockade peak is then a linear function of @xmath1 , and therefore the spacing should be a constant @xmath9 , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "recent experiments @xcite indicate however that spacing between coulomb blockade peaks in small quantum dots is in general not constant but , rather , a fluctuating quantity close to gaussian .",
    "the average of its distribution approximately coincides with the constant value mentioned above , but the elucidation of its standard deviation is still under investigation @xcite .",
    "the situation is even more intriguing if the quantum dot is very large .",
    "as indicated in a series of recent experiments , the spacing occasionally vanishes , namely , two peaks ( and sometimes even three peaks ) coincide .",
    "moreover , the evolution of peak positions and spacings with an applied magnetic field indicates the existence of strong correlations between them @xcite .",
    "these observations motivated numerous theoretical models based on the concept of pair tunneling @xcite or that of two - electron bound - states in depleted electron islands @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work we examine the scenario according to which a large quantum dot , like the one used in the last experiment @xcite , is , in fact , composed of _ several _ electron islands which are coupled capacitively among themselves as well as to the leads .",
    "electrons are added in such a way that the total potential energy of the dot is minimum .",
    "this simple generalization of the single island picture leads to a remarkable change in the spacing distribution from a gaussian @xcite centered around a finite average to one which is large at small spacings .",
    "when the coupling between islands is zero , the distribution has indeed a maximum at zero spacing .",
    "if the coupling is non - zero but small , the maximum is slightly shifted away from zero , yet leaving an appreciable tail down to zero .",
    "these results are short of explaining the perfect overlap of peaks , since it requires a delta function component at zero spacing . yet",
    ", it leads to the occurrence of couples and sometimes triples of closely spaced peaks , similar to the experimental observation .",
    "moreover , the evolution of the peak positions with the magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the experimental one . on the other hand",
    ", the present model does not predict a definite periodicity in the bunching of coulomb blockade peaks with electron number @xmath1 . in the next section",
    "the model is explained , and the results of the calculations are presented in section 3 .",
    "we consider a large isolated two - dimensional quantum dot in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath10 subject to a gate voltage @xmath11 . unlike the traditional coulomb blockade picture",
    ", it might contain _ several _ electron islands which can be regarded as metallic objects with inductive couplings among themselves .",
    "these are determined by a positive definite symmetric matrix @xmath2 whose diagonal elements @xmath12  the corresponding capacities  are positive , whereas the nondiagonal elements @xmath13  the corresponding coefficients of induction  are negative .",
    "the electrostatic energy of such a system may be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of electrons on island @xmath16 ( the number of islands @xmath17 might be around @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is the total numbers of electrons , and @xmath20 is the ( symmetric positive - definite ) matrix @xmath21 .    beside the electrostatic energy it is assumed that electrons in each island occupy single particle quantum states ( orbitals ) , whose energies @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) depend on the confining potential as well as on the magnetic field .",
    "the latter is manifested through its orbital effects as well as due to zeeman splitting ( in which case the quantum number @xmath24 contains also a spin label ) .",
    "the corresponding occupation numbers @xmath25 can be either @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the system described above might then be represented by a classical hamiltonian @xmath28 where the charging hamiltonian @xmath29 is just the electrostatic energy of ( [ eq_ec ] ) written in terms of the orbital occupation numbers @xmath30 [ \\sum_{\\alpha ' } n_{j \\alpha ' } ] -v_{g } \\sum_{i=1}^{k } \\sum_{\\alpha } n_{i \\alpha } , \\label{eq_hc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the single particle part of the hamiltonian @xmath31 is @xmath32 the precise form of the matrix elements @xmath33_{ij}$ ] as well as the single particle energies @xmath22 are specified in the next section when we present our results . despite the fact that the hamiltonian @xmath34 is classical ( and relatively simple ) ,",
    "the elucidation of its spectrum for large @xmath1 and @xmath35 is virtually hopeless . in order to compute the ground state energy @xmath36",
    ", one has to find the minimum of @xmath37 on all the possible @xmath35-tuples @xmath38 with the constraint @xmath39 .",
    "note that the so - called `` coulomb glass '' model obtains as a special case when @xmath16 refers to a lattice site with random energy @xmath40 , and a single orbital @xmath41 .",
    "the interaction matrix is then given by @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the distance between sites @xmath16 and @xmath46 .",
    "the position of the @xmath8 conductance peak is given by the first difference of the ground state energy , namely , the chemical potential of the ( isolated ) dot , @xmath47 .",
    "the spacing between peaks is determined by the second difference ( the inverse compressibility ) , @xmath48 the occurrence of close peaks for certain values of electron number @xmath1 corresponds to small values of @xmath49 ( recall that for a single island quantum dot , in which the single particle energies are neglected , the inverse compressibility is a constant @xmath50 ) . for the more general model described above the spacing distribution",
    "will of course fluctuate . in general , some constants appearing in the hamiltonian @xmath51 are random ( e.g. the elements of the matrix @xmath2 and the single particle energies @xmath22 ) , but most experiments are performed on a single quantum dot , so that fluctuations are meant with respect to the electron number @xmath1 .",
    "the numbers @xmath52 might then be considered as values assumed by a random variable @xmath53 which has a certain distribution function @xmath54 .",
    "+ it might be instructive to compute the distribution @xmath54 for a particular special case ( albeit not realistic ) which looks deceptively simple .",
    "the reader who is not interested may skip the rest of this section .",
    "take @xmath17 , @xmath55 for @xmath43 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath57 is the classical energy of a set of @xmath35 charged metallic bodies which are very far apart from each other , so there is no coupling among them .",
    "this problem then belongs to a class of problems dealing with statistics of spectra of independent quantum systems @xcite .",
    "here it refers to the addition spectra for a system composed of several independent subsystems , each of which has a certain spectrum which is a quadratic function of the number of particles residing on it .",
    "thus , for example , by replacing @xmath58 , it can represent the energy of @xmath1 spinless fermions distributed among @xmath35 independent oscillators .",
    "+ our aim is to find the distribution function @xmath54 .",
    "if charge is not quantized , the problem of finding the ground state energy is simply formulated as follows : given @xmath35 independent capacitors @xmath59 , ( in general , with random capacitances @xmath60 ) , how should the corresponding charges @xmath61 be chosen so as to minimize the electrostatic energy @xmath62 while holding the total charge @xmath63 fixed ?",
    "this constrained minimum problem is trivially solved by requiring @xmath64 and expressing @xmath65 .",
    "it is evident from dimensional arguments that @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath67 , with some coefficient denoted by @xmath68 , in which @xmath2 may be interpreted as the total capacitance of the system .",
    "evidently , in this case the second derivative of @xmath66 with respect to @xmath69 is independent of q ( and is easily calculated ) , namely @xmath70 .    what happens then if charge _",
    "the formulation of the problem is now repeated albeit with @xmath71 ( with @xmath1 and @xmath15 integers ) . intuitively , one would expect @xmath54 to be centered about @xmath9 , but , surprisingly , this is not the case , and @xmath54 is large near @xmath72 .",
    "an analytic expression for @xmath54 has been obtained recently by the authors @xcite . in order to present it ,",
    "let us assume that the @xmath35 capacities @xmath73 are rearranged so that @xmath74 .",
    "it is also useful to divide all the capacitors by the largest one , to obtain scaled capacitors @xmath75 . with @xmath76 .",
    "now let us define the following quantities : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 with these notations we can provide a precise formula for the spacing distribution .",
    "the formula relates to the density function of the distribution and holds in the generic case ( meaning that for a specific set of measure 0 of parameters it is incorrect ) .",
    "the following is obtained if the spacings are normalized to lie in the interval @xmath80 $ ] ( multiplying all of them by @xmath81 ) : @xmath82 a plot of @xmath54 is given in figure  [ fig1 ] and shows indeed that it has a maximum at @xmath72 and a delta function component at the inverse of the largest capacitance .",
    "in fact , when @xmath83 , the weight of the delta function shrinks to zero and ( after an appropriate renormalization ) @xmath54 approaches the poisson distribution @xmath84 . +",
    "we now return to the full hamiltonian of eq .",
    "it contains the coefficients of capacitance and induction matrix @xmath85 and the single particle energies @xmath22 as input . in choosing the actual numerical values we use a few guidelines ,",
    "one of which is to avoid too many independent input data . as will be clear below , these are _ not _ fitting parameters , but rather a set of constants which are chosen once and for all on general physical grounds .",
    "first , for the electrostatic part , recall that the matrix @xmath2 should be a symmetric positive definite matrix with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath43 .",
    "besides , we expect it to be random .",
    "we then assume that @xmath88 are random numbers uniformly distributed between @xmath26 and @xmath89 , whereas the nondiagonal elements are uniformly distributed between @xmath90 and @xmath26 . actually , it is only the ratio @xmath91 which matters , so one may assume @xmath92 and use @xmath93 as an energy unit , leaving @xmath94 as a single constant reflecting the strength of coupling between islands .",
    "practically , for each realization of @xmath95 s drawn at random we check whether the resulting matrix is positive definite , and reject realizations which are not .",
    "thus , we must put the restriction @xmath96 in order to generate a positive definite matrix @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath97 ( and @xmath98 ) most of the matrices generated randomly failed to be positive definite .",
    "second , for the single particle energies , we consider each electron island @xmath16 as a two - dimensional potential well @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is an effective mass .",
    "one may then regard @xmath101 as a measure of the radius of the corresponding electron island . since the capacitance @xmath88 is also proportional to this radius we assume @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is a constant reflecting the relation between charging energies and single particle energies .",
    "the single particle energies in each electron island ( subject to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath10 ) are then given explicitly . to be more specific ,",
    "recall that in two dimensions there are two quantum numbers for the orbital motion ( denoted hereafter by @xmath104 ) to which we add a spin index @xmath105 .",
    "then , with @xmath106 , we have @xmath107   + g \\mu_{b } \\sigma b , \\label{eq_eps } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath109 is the g - factor and @xmath110 is the bohr magneton . since @xmath109 contains the effective mass it is not known accurately .",
    "its value is constrained on physical grounds ( see below ) .",
    "note that in this scheme the spacings between single particle energies are deterministic , and do not follow the wigner surmise .",
    "the main cause of fluctuation is then due to the combination of non - random single particle energies and the occurrence of numerous charging energies .",
    "finally , the number of electron islands @xmath35 is determined by the size of the quantum dot .",
    "the four input data of the model are then @xmath111 and @xmath109 .",
    "note that the gate voltage @xmath4 does not have an important role here .",
    "indeed , in actual experiments the variation of gate voltage serves to adjust the energies @xmath36 with the chemical potential of the leads , but here the ground state energies are calculated directly .",
    "+ in order to avoid redundancy we are content with having a single set of these constants which is physically reasonable .",
    "in particular , it assures that the charging energy is much larger than single particle level spacings and that the zeeman splitting is small at moderate magnetic fields .",
    "specifically , for @xmath112 we test the distributions for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , while for @xmath115 we fix @xmath116 . besides , we take @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is chosen such that for moderate fields the zeeman splitting is of the order of the mean level spacing . finally , the number of electron islands is fixed as @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , we use just a brute force trial algorithm , and hence can not treat systems with a large number of electron islands . + with these prescriptions the ground state energies @xmath36 and their first and second differences are calculated for @xmath112 up to @xmath119 and for @xmath115 up to @xmath120 .",
    "the first question we addressed is how the electrons are added among the islands .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows electron numbers @xmath15 in each of the five islands , _",
    "v.s _ the total electron number @xmath1 , in the range @xmath121 ( for @xmath116 ) . evidently , the order of curves is according to the value of the capacitance @xmath88 . on a larger scale , the numbers @xmath15 grow linearly with @xmath1 , as it should be .",
    "let us then consider the question of redistribution . from figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we see that redistribution occurs only once , as @xmath1 grows between @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( see the vertical line ) .",
    "the addition of an electron to the second ( or third ) island involves also a transfer of an electron from the fourth island to the second ( or the third ) one .",
    "this scenario occurs also in other ranges of @xmath1 with the same proportion ( namely about four percent ) .",
    "thus , within the present model , redistribution is present , although it is rare and minimal .",
    "+ the next question we address is how the ratio between the inductive and capacitive coefficients ( represented here by the parameter @xmath94 ) affects the distribution @xmath54 .",
    "it was shown in the previous section that for @xmath124 the distribution has a maximum at @xmath72 .",
    "it is intuitively expected ( based on the concept of level repulsion ) that for @xmath125 the maximum will be shifted away from zero .",
    "this is also verified by our numerical results but , somewhat unexpectedly , the peak at small @xmath53 persists even at @xmath126 . the distribution @xmath54 is drawn in figure  [ fig3 ] for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the normalization is such that the largest capacitor is @xmath129 , so that if other capacitors are absent the distribution would have a delta function at @xmath130 . in all three cases",
    "the peak position is much smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "recall , however , that besides the capacitance induction matrix @xmath2 the total energy is determined also by the single particle energies in each island .",
    "the remarkable point is that the distribution is not gaussian ( which is the hallmark of spacing distributions in small quantum dots ) .",
    "+ finally , we check the behavior of the first difference @xmath131 as a function of the magnetic field . recall that this quantity is proportional to the position of the @xmath8 coulomb blockade peak . as a measure of the strength of the magnetic field we use the parameter @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the harmonic oscillator frequency of the largest island .",
    "the positions of the peaks for @xmath134 and @xmath135 are displayed in figure  [ fig4 ] . a comparison with the results displayed in figure 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite indicates a remarkable qualitative agreement .",
    "in particular , it shows that groups of two ( and sometimes even three ) electrons can tunnel through the quantum dot at almost the same gate voltage .",
    "the oscillations at small magnetic field just mark transitions to lower landau levels as the magnetic field increases .",
    "the phenomena of alternate bunching @xmath136 is also reproduced in the present picture .",
    "+ in conclusion , we suggest a classical model in which a large semiconductor quantum dot is viewed as a collection of metallic electron islands with capacitive and inductive coupling among them .",
    "the effect of adding a magnetic field is manifested through its orbital as well as its spin contents .",
    "the model can explain the occasional occurrence of couples or even triples of closely spaced coulomb blockade peaks , as well as the qualitative behavior of peak positions with the magnetic field .",
    "the results of the previous section displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] together with an analysis of the results displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] can provide an answer to the question why , in the present model , there are couples and sometimes even triples of close coulomb blockade peaks . when the capacitors are completely independent , the distribution is close to poissonian as can be proved analytically . introducing an inductive coupling spoils this picture , but does not destroy it completely , so that even at @xmath137 there is still a probability for the occurrence of close peaks .",
    "the eventual decrease of the distribution near @xmath72 seems to be related to the fact that , unlike the case of independent systems , the capacitance matrix is non - diagonal .",
    "switching on the coupling here then has an effect similar to a weak `` spacing repulsion '' , similar to the familiar effect of perturbation in two level systems .",
