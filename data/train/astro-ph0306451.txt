    "studies of x - ray line profiles from single early - type stars have already been used to test the standard wind - shock model of x - ray production , in which instabilities due to the line - driving force give rise to shocks distributed throughout the stellar wind @xcite .",
    "line profile calculations based upon such models ( with x - ray production effectively distributed uniformly throughout a steady - state or accelerating stellar wind ) generally predict broad , blueshifted and blue - skewed line profiles @xcite .",
    "however , blueshifted lines have only been observed from @xmath9 puppis @xcite , while the lines observed from @xmath10 orionis @xcite and @xmath11 scorpii @xcite are far narrower than is expected from the standard wind shock model .",

    "the results are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] and summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the line profiles presented here will ultimately be compared with x - ray spectra of cwbs , and potentially offer another tool for placing constraints on the wind parameters of such systems , as well as providing new insights into the structure of the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations of cwbs were carried out using vh-1 , an implementation of the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) developed by john blondin and co - workers at the university of virginia .",
    "the cwbs are characterized by the wind momentum ratio @xmath14 , given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16  and @xmath17  are the mass - loss rates of the stars and @xmath18  and @xmath19  are the terminal velocities of the winds @xcite . by definition ,",
    "star a ( the primary ) is the one with the more powerful wind ( i.e. @xmath20 ) .",
    "modelling the flow in a cwb is a three - dimensional problem .",
    "however , except in very close binaries , the orbital velocity of the stars is much less than the terminal velocity of the winds .",
    "since we are not modelling close binaries , coriolis forces are assumed to be negligible , and the problem reduces to a two - dimensional axisymmetric flow .",
    "this greatly reduces the amount of computer time needed to model the system .",
    "it is important to note that the goal of this work is to gain insights into where different x - ray lines originate in the wind - wind collision zone , and how the profiles are affected by different wind parameters . as a result , rather than modelling specific cwbs ,",
    "we have chosen wind parameters that are representative of typical systems .",
    "in particular , the stellar separation is fixed at @xmath21 ( 287@xmath22 ) , mass - loss rates are typically @xmath23@xmath24 , and wind speeds are typically 2000@xmath13 .    for these wind parameters",
    "the winds can be assumed to be adiabatic , because the cooling time @xmath25 is large compared with @xmath26 , the escape time from the shock region ; i.e. the cooling parameter @xmath27 @xcite is large .",
    "a few simulations were carried out with radiative cooling included self - consistently .",
    "the inclusion of cooling did not significantly affect the results , and so in general it was not included at all .",
    "a further assumption is that the winds are at their terminal velocities ( @xmath28 ) when they collide .",
    "this assumption is valid for wide systems , since the winds of early - type stars typically reach their terminal velocities within a few stellar radii of the stellar surface .",
    "this assumption may be relaxed in the future for models of specific close binary systems , using the method described in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : densityandtemperaturemaps ] is an example snapshot from one of the hydrodynamical simulations , showing the temperature and density structure of a cwb with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "for these wind parameters , the cooling parameters @xcite are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and so the winds can indeed be assumed to be adiabatic .",
    "note also that instabilities can be seen in the shocked gas , which may be due to either a difference in flow velocities along the two sides of the contact discontinuity between the two winds @xcite or numerical effects near the line of centres .",
    "the method used for calculating x - ray line profiles from the hydrodynamic simulations simply involves calculating the line profile for each point on the grid and summing over the whole grid .",
    "thermal doppler broadening is the dominant effect , and so each grid point is assumed to produce a gaussian line profile whose height and width depend on the temperature of the gas at that point , and whose centre is blue- or redshifted according to the line - of - sight velocity of the gas , i.e.    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the intensity of the line from the @xmath37th grid point between a velocity shift of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the ion mass , @xmath41 is the gas temperature , and @xmath42 is the line - of - sight velocity of the gas .",
    "the height of the gaussian @xmath43 is calculated using the list of spectral lines available from the spex website .",
    "this list gives the emissivity @xmath44 of a few thousand uv and x - ray lines over a range of temperatures .",
    "for an arbitrary temperature , the emissivity is calculated by interpolating between the tabulated values .",
    "if the temperature lies outside the range of temperatures for which there are data , the emissivity is assumed to be zero and the grid point is skipped over .",
    "the total line luminosity @xmath45 for the @xmath37th grid point is obtained by multiplying these emissivities by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the electron and hydrogen number densities and @xmath49 is the volume of the emitting gas at the grid point .",
    "@xmath45 is equal to the integral of equation ( [ eq : gaussianprofile ] ) over all @xmath38 , and so    @xmath50    two major assumptions have to be made in order to use the data in the spex list of lines .",
    "firstly , the plasma is assumed to be in collisional ionization equilibrium , and secondly both winds are assumed to have solar abundances .",
    "the latter is a valid assumption for o+o binaries , but not for wr+o binaries , in which the wolf ",
    "rayet wind has significantly non - solar abundances .",
    "this assumption will be relaxed in the future when specific wr+o binaries are modelled .    the line profile produced by each grid point",
    "is then attenuated by photoabsorption . the absorbing column to each emitting grid point is calculated by integrating the density numerically along the line - of - sight .",
    "the density is either obtained directly from the hydrodynamic grid , or by extrapolation when off the grid .",
    "the opacities used were calculated for a solar abundance plasma using xstar . for a given line",
    ", the opacity is assumed to be constant with wavelength across the width of the line profile .",
    "most of the absorption takes place in the cool , unshocked winds surrounding the wind - wind collision region , which are both assumed to have a temperature of @xmath51 .",
    "however , opacities have also been calculated for higher temperatures ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) . the opacity of hot , shocked gas of arbitrary temperature in the wind - wind collision region is taken into account by interpolating between these values , though in fact this gas makes only a small contribution to the overall absorption .",
    "when calculating the contribution of gas off the grid to the absorption , we assume its temperature is equal to the gas temperature at the point on the line - of - sight where we leave the grid . this tends to underestimate the absorption , as it sometimes assumes that gas off the grid is hotter than it actually is .",
    "the alternative is to assume that all the gas off the grid is cold ( @xmath56 ) , which would tend to overestimate the absorption .",
    "however , we have found that there is generally very little difference in the resulting profiles calculated by the two methods .",
    "the resulting line profile from the cwb is the sum of all the profiles calculated by the above method for the entire grid .",

    "the horizontal dashed lines on the hwhm graphs show the thermal doppler widths at the temperature of maximum line emission ( for comparison ) .    in the equal winds case ( @xmath67 ) , the unabsorbed lines are approximately symmetrical and unshifted for all viewing angles .",
    "while some slight asymmetries can be seen , these are due to numerical effects .",
    "theoretically , the unabsorbed lines for @xmath67 must be purely symmetrical .",
    "for @xmath70 , the lines are blueshifted when the system is viewed from the side of the secondary ( @xmath71 ) and redshifted when the system is viewed from the side of the primary ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the maximum shifts occur when @xmath73 .",
    "this occurs because the shocked region is bent towards the secondary when @xmath70 .",
    "when the system is being viewed along the line of centres , the general motion of the shocked gas is either towards or away from the observer ( depending on which end of the line of centres they are looking from ) , with a fairly small spread in line - of - sight velocities , resulting in quite narrow lines .",
    "however , for other viewing angles this will not be the case  some of the gas will be moving towards the observer , some will be moving tangentially to the line of sight , and some will be moving away from the observer .",
    "the result of this is broader lines with smaller shifts .",
    "the extreme case is when the system is at quadrature ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed lines are very broad ( @xmath1 ) , but symmetrical and unshifted , apart from the presence of the secondary component on the redward side .",
    "this is exactly as expected , owing to the cylindrical symmetry of the hydrodynamic simulation  for every ` blob ' of plasma moving towards the observer there s a corresponding blob on the far side of the system moving away at the same speed . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the velocity shift ( towards the blue or the red , depending on the viewing orientation ) increases with @xmath14 , because the shocked region is bent more towards or away from the observer .    in all cases ,",
    "the hwhms are considerably larger than the typical thermal widths , indicating that the line broadening is due to a wide range of line - of - sight velocities in the bulk motion of the hot gas , rather than merely being due to simple thermal doppler broadening .",
    "the line luminosities increase with @xmath14 , because a larger @xmath76  leads to a denser x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "however , for a given @xmath14  the unabsorbed line luminosities do not vary with @xmath62 , since these depend on the amount of hot plasma on the hydrodynamical grid , which is independent of viewing angle .",
    "the above discussion pertains only to the unabsorbed line profiles . from the figures",
    "one can clearly see that absorption has a much more significant effect on the longer wavelength lines , such as the oviii  and nex  ly@xmath57  lines .",
    "this is because the continuum opacity in the cold stellar winds increases with wavelength .",
    "the opacity at the wavelength of the oviii  ly@xmath57  line is 27.5 times that at the wavelength of the sxvi  ly@xmath57  line .",
    "this outweighs the fact that the longer wavelength lines originate from the cooler shocked gas far from the line of centres , and so travel through less dense regions of the stellar winds .    in general , the inclusion of absorption results in blueward - skewed lines .",
    "this is because the gas that is moving away from the observer is generally on the far side of the system , and so suffers more absorption .",
    "indeed , for @xmath77 , the velocity shift of the absorbed line is always more towards the blue than the corresponding unabsorbed line , though when the system is viewed from the side of the primary , the lines retain a mean redshift .",
    "this is because when the shocked region is bent away from the observer , there is very little blueshifted emission at all , and so the fact that redshifted emission is more strongly attenuated than blueshifted emission is less important . the range of viewing angles over which one expects to see redshifted emission is larger for the shorter wavelength lines , because absorption is less important for these lines .",
    "one would expect to see redshifted oviii  ly@xmath57  emission for @xmath78 , whereas the sxvi   ly@xmath57  line is redshifted when @xmath79 .",
    "the hwhms of the absorbed lines are generally either very similar to those of the corresponding unabsorbed lines , or considerably smaller ( there is very little middle ground ) .",
    "the latter case generally occurs for the oviii  line when @xmath80@xmath81 or @xmath79 , and for the nex  line when @xmath79 ( though the hwhms of the absorbed and unabsorbed lines are again very similar as @xmath62 approaches 180 ) .",
    "it also occurs to a lesser extent for the mgxii  line when @xmath82@xmath83 .",
    "this narrowing of the absorbed lines occurs because of the higher opacity at the wavelengths of these lines .",
    "the profiles have their redward emission strongly attenuated , particularly when @xmath70 and the system is being viewed through the dense wind of the primary ( @xmath79 ) . if it is attenuated to less than half the peak value of the blueward emission , only the blueshifted peak will contribute to the hwhm .",
    "this results in a considerably smaller hwhm , though the lines do have large redward tails .",
    "however , it is worth noting that in practice such redward tails may not by observable ( they may be lost in the underlying continuum ) , and so the dominant observational signature would be a blueshift rather than a broadening",
    ". on the other hand , if the redward emission is not that strongly attenuated , the hwhm will be approximately equal to that of the unabsorbed line .",
    "this is generally the case for the sixiv  and sxvi  lines .",
    "the luminosities of the absorbed lines decrease with @xmath62 for @xmath70 .",
    "this is simply because as @xmath62 increases , one changes from observing the system through the wind of the secondary to observing it through the denser wind of the primary .      figs .",

    "[ fig : cwacwjlinestats ] compares lines from systems with the same wind speeds but mass - loss rates that differ by an order of magnitude . for both lines",
    "there is no difference in the shapes of the unabsorbed profiles between the two systems , though the lines from the system with the larger mass - loss rates are brighter .",
    "however , the system with the higher mass - loss rates gives an absorbed oviii  line that is narrower and more blueshifted .",
    "this is because this system has denser winds , and so the line suffers more attenuation ( especially the redward emission ) . on the other hand",
    "the sxvi  line is not as strongly affected by absorption , and so there is very little difference between the two systems .    for a given @xmath14 , the effect of increasing the mass - loss rates on the observed ( i.e. absorbed ) line luminosities",
    "is a combination of two competing effects .",
    "the intrinsic line luminosity increases as @xmath84 , whereas the column density increases as @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the observed line luminosity scales as @xmath85 , where @xmath57 is a constant that depends on @xmath62 and the opacity for the line in question . for the systems described here , we find that the observed line luminosity always increases with increasing @xmath76  ( for all lines and for all @xmath62 ) . however , for larger mass - loss rates ( few times @xmath24 ) the increasing absorption starts to dominate , and when @xmath86 ( which is when the column density is largest ) the observed luminosities of the longer wavelength lines start to decrease with increasing @xmath76 .    fig .  [",
    "fig : cwjcwmlinestats ] compares the same two lines from systems with the same mass - loss rates but different wind velocities .",
    "once the wavelength shift and the hwhm have been scaled to the wind velocity , there is very little difference between the two systems .",
    "the oviii  line is generally slightly more blueshifted for the system with the lower wind velocity ( since , for the same mass - loss rate , this results in a denser wind and so more absorption ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the wavelength shift of the sxvi   line ( whether to the blue to the red ) is smaller for the system with the lower wind velocity .",
    "this may be because the lower wind speed results in a lower post - shock temperature , and so the line forms nearer the line of centres for this system . the shocked region is less bent towards ( away from ) the observer near the line of centres , resulting in a smaller blueshift ( redshift ) as @xmath62 approaches 0  ( 180 ) .",
    "eddies / swirls in the shocked gas are frequently seen in the hydrodynamical simulations of the cwbs used for this work .",
    "these travel from the line of centres to the edge of the grid ( typically @xmath87 from the line of centres ) on a time - scale of @xmath88 .",
    "these swirls may be due to either instabilities along the contact discontinuity between the two winds @xcite or numerical effects near the line of centres .    in order to investigate whether these swirls have any significant effect on the results , we have compared line profiles generated from snapshots of the hydrodynamical simulations separated by @xmath89 .",
    "over the course of 10 such snapshots , we find that the calculated wavelength shifts , hwhms and line luminosities typically vary by only a few per cent .",
    "this suggests that any observed time variability in the line profiles will be due to changes in the viewing orientation ( because of the orbital motion ) , rather than to instabilities , etc . in the shocked gas .",

    "we have seen that x - ray lines from cwbs show significant variation of wavelength shift and width as a function of viewing orientation , which is itself a function of orbital phase and inclination .",
    "the observation of phase - locked variation in the x - ray line profiles would therefore provide convincing evidence for x - ray emission from a colliding wind region . in this respect ,",
    "an eclipsing binary would be the most interesting system , since during the course of its orbit the full range of viewing angles discussed above would be observed .",
    "in contrast , a system with an inclination of 0  would always be observed at @xmath92 . any phase - locked variation in this case",
    "would just be associated with a change in orbital separation and hence the density of the shocked gas .",
    "this would probably just manifest itself as a change in line luminosity , not as a change in line shift or width .",
    "line profiles that vary during the orbit of a cwb have already been observed in the _ chandra _  spectra of wr 140 ( pollock et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the first observation was taken just before periastron at an orbital phase of 1.982 according to the ephemeris of @xcite . at this phase",
    "the wind collision region is bent approximately towards the observer ( see @xcite for a diagram of wr 140 s orbit ) , and the lines are significantly blueshifted , as would be expected .",
    "the second observation was taken just after periastron at a phase of 2.027 .",
    "although there are considerably fewer counts in this second spectrum , the lines are clearly much broader , and there is also some evidence of redshifts . while we have not compared in detail our theoretical profiles with the spectra of wr 140 , these observations seem to provide at least a qualitative confirmation of some of our general predictions .",
    "a more detailed comparison of our model line profiles with observed high - resolution x - ray spectra of cwbs may enable us to place constraints on certain parameters of the system .",
    "in practice , one would just fit to the shifts and widths of the lines , and scale the luminosities of the theoretical lines to the observed luminosities .",
    "( this approach of fitting the line _ shapes _ , not the luminosities , has already been used by @xcite to model the line emission from the single o star @xmath9 pup . ) for a cwb , the main parameters would be the wind momentum ratio @xmath14  and the viewing angle @xmath62 , although it may also be possible to place constraints on the individual wind parameters . for this method to be effective",
    ", one would want to fit as many lines as possible simultaneously .",
    "while we have only presented results for ly@xmath57  lines here , the method described could be used for any line that is not affected by the density ( e.g. ly@xmath93  and ly@xmath94  lines , and the resonant component of the _ fir _ triplets from he - like ions ) .",
    "the model presented here for calculating x - ray line profiles from cwbs is fairly simple , but it contains the essential physics and gives an overview of how the profiles vary with wind parameters and viewing angle . when the model comes to be applied to real systems , extra physics will be included in the calculations as is appropriate for the systems in question .",
    "this could include modifying the hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. radiative cooling for systems with small orbital separations and/or large mass - loss rates @xcite or radiative driving for close systems @xcite ) , or modifying the actual line profile calculations ( e.g. taking into account non - solar abundances for wr+o binaries ) .",
    "we have presented theoretical x - ray line profiles from model colliding wind systems for a range of mass - loss rates , wind velocities and viewing angles .",
    "a wide range of profile shapes is possible , varying with orbital inclination and phase .    for a high inclination binary with @xmath70",
    "there is a general blue / redshift at phases 0 and 0.5 ( i.e. at the two conjunctions ) .",
    "the profiles are narrow ( @xmath0 ) and approximately gaussian . by contrast , at quadrature the profiles are generally very broad ( @xmath1 ) , flat - topped and unshifted .",
    "local absorption has a major effect on the observed profiles . when a system with relatively large mass - loss rates ( few times @xmath2 ) is viewed through the dense wind of the primary , the lines are generally skewed towards the blue .",
    "this is because the redshifted emission is strongly attenuated .",
    "this effect is most noticeable for the lower energy lines ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these blueward - skewed profiles generally have large redward tails . in practice these tails may not be observable , and so the line would be seen as fairly narrow and blueshifted , rather than broad and blueward - skewed .    a binary with a low orbital inclination will exhibit less orbital variation of line width and shift , the extreme case being a binary with @xmath4 , for which we would expect no orbital variation in the line profile .",
    "after the line shifts and widths have been scaled to the wind velocity , there is very little difference between the results from systems with @xmath32 and with @xmath95 .",
    "the former systems have denser winds for the same mass - loss rate , and hence absorption has a larger effect .",
    "however , it does not significantly affect the results .",
    "simple monte carlo simulations of observed x - ray line profiles show that the features discussed above will be detectable in good _ chandra _  hetgs spectra of cwbs .",
    "comparing our theoretical profiles with such spectra potentially offers another method for determining the wind parameters of cwbs , and may also give us new insights into the structure of the wind - wind collision regions .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge funding from the school of physics & astronomy ( dbh ) and pparc ( irs , jmp ) ."
