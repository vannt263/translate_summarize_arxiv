    "@xcite presented a probabilistic interpretation of resonant states . in these works ,",
    "a resonance is defined as an eigenfunction of a hamiltonian with siegert boundary conditions , that is , when the potential goes to zero , the wave functions is only an outgoing wave @xcite . due to siegert conditions ,",
    "the problem is not hermitian ; the eigenvalues are complex , the wave functions are not square integrable and the particle number around a central volume exponentially decays in time because of momentum leaks from this volume .",
    "many methods were developed in order to calculate the complex eigenvalues of resonant states .",

    "however , due to its simplicity , there also exist several techniques to calculate the real part of a resonance eigenvalue using the ritz - variational method with a square integrable real basis - set .",
    "these methods , called in general stabilization methods @xcite , use the abrupt change of a physical quantity when a variable is  crossing \" a resonance .",
    "in particular different authors used the variational energies @xcite , the von neumann entropy @xcite , or properties as the double - orthogonality condition @xcite to obtain the real part of the energy . in order to calculate the imaginary part of the resonant energy , all these methods use an approximation of the density of states fitting the numerical data using a lorentzian function @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the formalism of hatano @xcite to obtain an expression of the imaginary part of the energy useful to calculate it using only a stabilization method , without an extra fitting or approximation .",
