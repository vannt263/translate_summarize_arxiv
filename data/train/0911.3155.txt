    "2006 ) . in this work , we combine the large quasar sample provided by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite with recent advances in virial mass estimation @xcite to develop new constraints on quasar turnoff .    it had been previously thought that most quasars were within a factor of @xmath2 of their eddington luminosity @xcite , and quasars have been commonly modeled as ` light - bulbs ' , operating either near eddington or without substantial luminous accretion , although this is likely an oversimplification @xcite . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we used the quasar distribution in the mass - luminosity plane as a function of redshift .",
    "had the relationship between quasar mass and luminosity been trivial ( as implied by the the light - bulb approximation ) the mass - luminosity plane would not present an improvement over the quasar mass function or luminosity function .",
    "instead , we found a more complex relationship between mass and luminosity than had been previously assumed .",
    "several new puzzles have emerged from this view of the quasar distribution , including a sub - eddington boundary that restricts luminosities of the highest - mass quasars at every redshift to lie below their eddington limit .",
    "we also noted an upper mass limit varying with redshift . in this work",
    ", we use this new , multi - dimensional view of the quasar distribution to investigate this high - mass ` turnoff ' in detail .",
    "we use these results to evaluate three basic assumptions : ( 1 ) that the dynamics of quasar turnoff are closely linked to the dynamics of the host galaxy , ( 2 ) that a segregation of quasars by mass is equivalent to a segregation of quasars by luminosity , ( a corollary of the light - bulb approximation ) , and ( 3 ) that smbh undergo no fundamental change during turnoff , but rather run out of fuel ( which implies that an individual smbh might have many luminous episodes during its lifetime and would undergo another one today given sufficient fuel ) .    in   [ sec :",

    "( 2003 ) and paper i. in   [ sec : permanent ] , we establish that massive quasars are indeed turning off , and doing so earlier than lower - mass quasars . in   [ sec : signatures ] , we use this to select individual quasars near turnoff and search for signatures of their turnoff mechanisms . in   [ sec : synch ] , we show that the synchronization of turnoff of different quasars at a given mass is closer than that of the dynamics of their host galaxies . we also show that the synchronization of quasars at fixed mass is characteristically different from that of quasars at fixed luminosity as reported in amarie et al .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] , we evaluate the three basic assumptions above in light of this new evidence .",
    "black hole masses for 62,185 of the 77,429 sdss dr5 quasars @xcite were determined by shen et al .",

    "as discussed elsewhere @xcite , civ - based estimation is substantially less accurate than h@xmath0 or mgii , while mgii has a smaller statistical uncertainty than h@xmath0 .",
    "vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) report an uncertainty for virial mass estimation of @xmath4 dex from calibration against reverberation mapping , while in paper iii we discuss the possibility that the statistical uncertainty may be closer to @xmath5 dex and the remaining deviations due to systematic effects .    as in paper",
    "i , we divided the sample into redshift bins of size @xmath6 in @xmath7 for @xmath8 and larger redshift bins for @xmath9 .",
    "table [ table : bins ] contains summary statistics on the objects in each bin . within each bin",

    ".summary statistics on quasars in the 13 redshift and emission line bins .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : hmllb ]    poisson uncertainties on the number density of objects at the boundary suggest a relative uncertainty between the boundary at different masses .",
    "we use these relative uncertainties in the determination of a best - fitting line . at each sufficiently high redshift ( @xmath11 )",
    ", there is a hmllb present . below this redshift ,",
    "the peak number density lies near the sdss detection limit , so it is possible that a hmllb would exist with improved detection .",
    "the hmllb is not at a constant fraction of @xmath12 ( slope of 1.0 ) , but rather at a slope at or below that of the sub - eddington boundary .    at @xmath13 , where there are both mgii and h@xmath0 masses available , the hmllb have similar slopes but start at a @xmath14 dex lower mass in the mgii quasar locus than in the h@xmath0-based locus .",
    "onken & kollmeier ( 2008 ) suggest that mgii masses may need to be recalibrated against h@xmath0 masses , and risaliti , young , & elvis ( 2009 ) compare h@xmath0 and mgii masses to suggest @xmath15=1.8\\times\\log[m_{bh}(mg{\\small ii})]-6.8.$ ] .",
    "applying this correction would produce a mgii - based hmllb slope of @xmath16 at @xmath13 .",
    "both this corrected slope and the uncorrected hmllb slope of @xmath17 are consistent with the h@xmath0-based slope of @xmath18 .",
    "while the seb at this redshift implies the mgii mass correction may not be required for the most massive and most luminous objects at each redshift , the hmllb only provides an inconclusive test of these corrections at high mass and low luminosity .",
    "possible explanations for the dearth of high - mass , low - luminosity quasars can be divided into three categories :    1 .",
    "the sdss pipeline might not select such objects as quasars , either due to an error in selection or because there is a high - mass , low - luminosity boundary ( hmllb ) at which quasars gradually transition to an object classified differently ( such as a seyfert galaxy ) but with a similar spectral energy distribution to a quasar .",
    "their masses might be systematically underestimated or luminosities systematically overestimated .",
    "3 .   there might be a high - mass , low - luminosity boundary at which quasars very rapidly transition to an object with a very different spectral energy distribution outside the sdss locus , spending little time as a transitional object similar to a quasar .",
    "we will consider the first two possibilities below and the third in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "sdss selection for well - measured objects above the detection limit consists of identifying the object from its magnitudes in the five sdss spectral bands .",
    "if there is an hmllb at which sdss mistakenly ceases to select objects as quasars , this would imply that quasars at the hmllb are also at a boundary of the sdss quasar locus .",
    "the sharpest hmllb ( with the fewest points lying below the hmllb and the best - determined slope ) occurs in the @xmath19 redshift bin , so it is the best candidate for a selection effect . at that redshift , there are 15 quasars with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in figure",
    "[ fig : turnsel ] , the colors of these 15 objects are shown in four slices of the five - dimensional color space used by sdss in its photometric selection .    their locations are not tightly clustered in color space , although a larger fraction lie at the outer edges of the sdss loci than would be expected if they were drawn randomly from the sdss quasar catalog .",
    "however , the hmllb does not lie along a photometric selection boundary , nor are there additional selection criteria that these objects are close to @xcite .",
    "sdss selection is not responsible for the hmllb .    while a mass - dependent systematic error in luminosity determination seems plausible , masses at the hmllb at lower redshift",
    "are at the low - mass end of the quasar sample at higher redshift .",
    "as discussed in paper i , when quasars determined to have identical masses are at the low - mass end of the quasar sample , they reach @xmath12 but do not surpass it . therefore , any systematic over - estimation of quasar luminosity of the sort required to explain the hmllb either also requires that no high - redshift quasar be near @xmath12 or that the hmllb is caused by a coincidence between redshift - dependent and mass - dependent systematic errors that almost entirely cancel for quasars at lower masses in every redshift bin while producing the hmllb at higher masses .",
    "such fine - tuning seems highly implausible , although it can not be ruled out from direct observational evidence .",
    "a systematic error in mass determination at the hmllb requires virial masses to be incorrect for faint quasars with very broad emission lines . for mgii in particular",
    ", the wings of wide emission lines with low equivalent width might be difficult to discern from slightly redder feii lines . to produce the hmllb , at @xmath19 high - mass and low - luminosity objects",
    "would need to have their masses underestimated by @xmath22 dex , if the highest - mass objects have identical mass at every luminosity ( figure [ fig : allzcontour ] ) .",
    "if turnoff is slow and the highest mass objects are more massive at low @xmath23 then a greater factor would be required .",
    "because virial masses depend upon the square of the h@xmath0 , mgii , or civ full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) , an error of @xmath22 dex in mass would require an error of @xmath24 dex in fwhm .",
    "figure [ fig : mgfwhm ] shows the spectrum of a quasar lying near the @xmath19 hmllb .",
    "this spectrum has the median signal - to - noise ratio for the @xmath19 hmllb of 3.36 , while quasars on the hmllb range in signal - to - noise from 2.26 to 6.29 .",
    "the fwhm measured by the sdss pipeline is shown in red . to increase the virial mass estimate by 0.5 dex",
    ", the fwhm would need to instead be of the size indicated by the blue line , which is clearly too broad and is closer to the entire width of the line itself than to its fwhm .",
    "there is an window of redshift at @xmath13 in which both h@xmath0-based and mgii - based mass estimates are available .",
    "if the mgii - based estimates are systematically too small near the hmllb due to fe contamination , the h@xmath0-based estimate for the same objects should be systematically larger .",
    "for all 3505 objects at @xmath13 , the mean @xmath25 dex , with a standard deviation of @xmath26 dex . of the 56 objects closest to the hmllb ( as determined by mgii masses ) , the mean @xmath27 dex smaller than those of mgii , with a standard deviation of @xmath28 dex .",
    "because these are at the high - mass tail of the mgii mass distribution , they are more likely to be objects where the mgii mass is larger than the h@xmath0 mass if their statistical uncertainties are uncorrelated .",
    "so , the atypically large mean @xmath29 for this sample should be expected .",
    "however , neither the entire population nor only quasars near the hmllb have a difference close to the the @xmath22 dex correction required to remove the hmllb",
    ".    finally , since virial mass estimation is calibrated from just @xmath30 objects @xcite , the relation may be poorly calibrated for unusual objects , perhaps including those near the hmllb .",
    "in particular , it is possible that the line fwhm and continuum are measured correctly but virial masses are systematically low near the hmllb .",
    "this possibility can not be ruled out directly from available data .",
    "virial mass estimates can be very nearly derived theoretically under the two assumptions that ( 1 ) peculiar velocities in the broad - line region are nearly virial and ( 2 ) the luminosity is nearly @xmath31 .",
    "the successful calibration of virial mass estimates against reverberation mapping suggests that these two assumptions hold for most quasars .",
    "breakdown in virial mass estimation near the hmllb would be an indicator that the properties of quasars change near the hmllb .    in conclusion , the hmllb is not caused by ( 1 ) erroneous sdss selection or ( 2 ) errors in determining spectral parameters used in virial mass estimation .",
    "incorrect luminosity determination near the hmllb would require a fine - tuning between redshift - dependent and mass - dependent systematic errors . the most likely explanation for the hmllb appears to be a transition in the properties of the quasar , which may be manifested either as a rapid change in the quasar seb ( leading to an object that no longer resembles a quasar in the five sdss color bands ) or as a breakdown in virial mass estimation near the hmllb ( e.g. , if the broad line region is no longer predominantly virial ) .",
    "different emission lines come from transitions with different ionization potentials , and are interpreted as being emitted at different radii from the central black hole@xcite .",
    "in particular , mgii is emitted furthest from the central black hole and civ nearest .",
    "changes in quasar structure near turnoff , either out in the broad - line region ( blr ) or closer in at the optical / uv emitting part of the accretion disk , may show up as unusual line ratios .",
    "the redshift ranges where we can see either the mgii and h@xmath0 or mgii and civ lines in the same spectrum allow us to test this idea . in figure 10",
    "we show these two line ratios as a function of mass .    for @xmath13 , the h@xmath0/mg / small ii ratio has a similar distribution at all black hole masses , although the very highest - mass objects ( blue , figure [ fig:10 ] ) might hint at a slight deviation ( 3% chance to be identical , a kolmogorov - smirnov test ) .",
    "this similarity suggests that , high - mass and low - mass quasars at @xmath32 have both similar blrs and ionizing continuum shapes .",
    "there is no difference in either the virial mass or bolometric luminosity estimation techniques between high - mass and low - mass quasars , and this similarity is at least partial confirmation that this might be reasonable .    a majority of the 723 quasars at @xmath33 will turn off by @xmath34 , i.e. , within their next @xmath35gyr . since we see no difference in the h@xmath0/mgii line ratio , this either means that the process by which they cease luminous accretion does not substantially change this ratio or that the turnoff is sufficiently rapid that we see no signature of it in figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "since there are @xmath36 quasars that turn off within @xmath37 gyr and there is no substantial population in the tails of the line ratio distribution , if the turnoff process involves one of these two emission lines substantially disappearing , we have seen no examples and therefore the turnoff process must require no more than tens of myr to complete . alternatively ,",
    "this places no limits on the timescale for a low - redshift turnoff process involving no changes in these line ratios .    at @xmath38 , the mgii to civ line ratio changes with mass , with the mgii line being stronger at high black hole mass .",
    "one possibility is that massive black holes tend to have strongly asymmetric civ lines@xcite , and therefore the line flux is underestimated by a gaussian fit .",
    "however , the civ line has a higher ionization potential . as a result",
    ", perhaps we could interpret figure [ fig:10 ] as showing that massive black holes have a different ionizing continuum than less massive black holes near @xmath39 .",
    "this might give us a hint as to the turnoff mechanism for massive black holes at @xmath39 .",
    "it is curious that the mgii to civ ratio changes with mass @xmath38 while at @xmath13 the h@xmath0/mgii ratio is not affected .",
    "because the three lines come from different ionization potentials , this apparent discrepancy might indicate that the turnoff process acts differently on the broad - line region and the ionizing continuum .",
    "alternatively , it might indicate that the turnoff mechanism is changing between these two redshift ranges .",
    "additional spectroscopy in the infrared and ultraviolet is possible and will be able to determine which interpretation is correct .",
    "in   [ sec : permanent ] , it was shown that the number density of quasars of a given @xmath40 declines with a mass - dependent e - folding time between 0.7 and 3 gyr for quasars with an @xmath40 of @xmath41 ( table [ table : decays ] ) .",
    "the sdss catalog includes much of the northern hemisphere and so includes quasars almost diametrically opposed in the sky . at a redshift of 2 ,",
    "they lie in host galaxies that had not been causally connected since inflation , while even at much lower redshift it is difficult to believe galaxies a few gpc apart would strongly influence each others development . yet , quasars with @xmath42 in such galaxies turn off synchronously to within 700 myr .",
    "could this be resolved if virial mass estimates are poorly calibrated at high mass ? while the details of quasar turnoff do rely upon high - mass objects , there is a similar synchronization in the sub - eddington boundary ( paper i ) .",
    "this boundary restricts quasars to a luminosity below @xmath12 at most masses and every redshift , with the restriction stronger with increasing mass .",
    "however , for every mass there is a redshift above which there is a substantial population accreting near @xmath12 .",
    "this again presents a synchronization problem ; for example , a substantial population of quasars with @xmath43 are at eddington at @xmath32 , but none are at eddington at @xmath44 , less than 2 gyr later .",
    "so it is not just turnoff that is synchronized for quasars at a given @xmath40 but rather most of their luminous accretion . because the location of the sub - eddington boundary declines in luminosity over time at a given mass , its sharpness is further evidence of this universal synchronization of quasar accretion .",
    "each quasar lies within a host galaxy , and it is widely assumed that the dynamics of quasar accretion are controlled by the dynamics of its host , since the host galaxy appears to be the only fuel source available .",
    "turnoff , then , would occur when the galaxy no longer can sufficiently fuel its central black hole , a condition presumably related to the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "further evidence for co - evolution of the quasar and the host galaxy comes from the black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath45 ) relation @xcite as well as because quasars of a given mass tend to also lie in host galaxies of a common mass @xcite .",
    "however , host galaxies of a given mass are not believed to be as well synchronized as required by quasar accretion or turnoff .",
    "the millenium simulation @xcite continues to produce new galaxies at low redshift , while galaxy merger rates are believed to only decline by a factor of @xmath2 between a redshift of 2 and today @xcite , equivalent to a characteristic e - folding timescale of @xmath46 gyr . in short , if the dynamics of quasars are only as synchronized as those of their host galaxies , our current theoretical understanding of galactic dynamics is incompatible with the data presented here .",
    "here and in paper i , we have considered what the quasar locus in the mass - luminosity plane can teach us about quasar accretion and turnoff .",
    "quasars have been modeled as very simple objects , in part because there has not yet been sufficient data to require more complex assumptions . in paper",
    "i , we falsified the assumption that quasars at all combination of mass and redshift were near their eddington luminosity while accreting luminously . with a combination of the large quasar catalog from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and virial mass estimation",
    ", we can now evaluate several other common assumptions .",
    "it is widely assumed that the dynamics of quasar turnoff are closely linked to the dynamics of the host galaxy .",
    "however as shown in   [ sec : synch ] , accretion rate and turnoff are highly synchronized amongst quasars of a common mass .",
    "either galaxies must be much more highly synchronized than currently believed or this synchronization must have an alternate source .",
    "galaxies continue to merge and virialize at later times than their quasars are predominantly turning off , and the decline in galaxy merger rates is believed to be much more gradual than that observed for quasars .",
    "so , why are quasars",
    "so well synchronized ?",
    "one possibility is that the seeding mechanism comes not from the dynamics of their host galaxy but rather from some mechanism with a cosmic clock .",
    "the @xmath47 myr timescale for quasar turnoff at @xmath42 corresponds to the hubble time at @xmath48 , and extrapolating the slope of the e - folding time as a function of mass (   [ sec : permanent ] ) to the highest - mass quasars would yield the hubble time at @xmath49 .",
    "it is plausible that the seeds of these massive quasars turn on during the epoch of reionization and , if the seeding mechanism is one that yields a nearly - fixed quasar life span , turnoff would be synchronized to roughly the observed precision .",
    "this would require a seeding mechanism only weakly linked to the dynamics surrounding galaxy , but rather triggered by cosmic dynamics .",
    "it is also widely assumed that most quasars are near eddington while accreting luminously .",
    "the presence of a sub - eddington boundary at which high - mass quasars can not reach their full eddington luminosity directly contradicts this claim and slows the maximum allowed growth rate .",
    "however the boundaries of the quasar locus are very sharp , and quasars of a given mass are highly synchronized in both the maximum luminosity they can attain and in their turnoff time . in the absence of techniques for mass estimation of high - redshift quasars , it was widely assumed that a segregation of quasars by mass was equivalent to a segregation by luminosity . since individual quasars are variable , this can not be entirely true , but there is certainly a correlation between quasar mass and luminosity as evidenced by the quasar distribution in the mass - luminosity plane ( figure [ fig : allzcontour ] ) .",
    "further , the high - mass , low - luminosity boundary suggests that even if high - mass quasars can not reach @xmath12 , luminous accretion is rare below a few percent of eddington as well .",
    "this also implies that the large milliquas sample @xcite of @xmath50 new sdss quasars selected photometrically but not bright enough for sdss spectroscopy consists predominantly of quasars at lower @xmath40 than those in the sdss spectroscopic quasar catalog rather than a mixture of quasars at low @xmath40 and quasars at higher @xmath40 and very low eddington ratio .",
    "finally , it is widely believed that a typical smbh will have many periods of luminous accretion separated by dormant periods . in part",
    ", this is because the salpeter time for black hole accretion at @xmath12 is only @xmath51 yr @xcite , and a quasar could not grow at @xmath12 for several gyr .",
    "however , the sub - eddington boundary restricts more massive quasars at every redshift to @xmath52 or below ( with the peak number density below @xmath53 ) , raising the possibility that rather than accreting luminously for less than 1 gyr , quasars might accrete luminously , but sub - eddington , in one long , continuous burst for several gyr from when they first turn on until turnoff .",
    "certainly the sub - eddington boundary requires that quasars accrete luminously far longer than previously believed .",
    "when quasars of a given mass no longer reach a given eddington ratio , the sub - eddington boundary never moves back to a higher luminosity .",
    "when quasars of a given mass begin to decline in number density , their turnoff is synchronized and sharp , and the population does not reappear at lower redshift . while this is insufficient evidence to conclude that turnoff is a permanent process for any individual quasar , a quasar lifecycle consisting of one long period of accretion followed by permanent turnoff is consistent with all of these observations .    as shown in ",
    "[ sec : signatures ] , the sharpness of the high - mass , low - luminosity boundary ( hmllb ) appears to require either that virial mass estimation is wrong near the hmllb or that quasars at the hmllb undergo a rapid transition to an object with a very different spectral energy distribution .",
    "one possibility would be transition to riaf accretion @xcite .",
    "however , the hmllb does not occur at a constant eddington ratio as accretion disk theory would suggest , but rather has a sub - linear dependence on mass .",
    "the hmllb is also evolving with redshift : the hmllb for high - mass quasars is at a higher redshift than lower - mass quasars .    in this paper , we have shown several new puzzles presented by the quasar mass - luminosity plane in addition to the sub - eddington boundary discussed in paper i. these new puzzles which can not be explained by selection effects are further evidence that supermassive black hole accretion and turnoff is more complex than previously believed .",
    "rather , many of the common assumptions made in quasar toy models are poor matches to the quasar locus in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "these new boundaries indicate both that a more nuanced quasar model is required and that the quasar mass - luminosity plane now contains enough detail that it might be able to provide strong tests for such new models .",
