    "this is corrected for the @xmath28 of muons , which do not deposit all of their energy in the calorimeter , and tracks which point to uninstrumented regions in the calorimeter .",
    "the missing transverse energy @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 . strongly interacting partons produced in the @xmath21 collision undergo fragmentation that results in highly collimated jets of hadronic particles .",
    "jet candidates are reconstructed using the calorimeter towers with corrections to improve the estimated energy  @xcite and are required to have @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 candidates are selected from two opposite - sign ( os ) leptons .",

    "uncertainties originating from lepton selection and trigger efficiency measurements are propagated through the acceptance calculation , giving uncertainties typically around 2% , but as high as 7% for the different signal and background processes . for the ss channel",
    ", there is an additional systematic for the simulated backgrounds which enter the sample only when a lepton s charge is mismeasured ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and dy ) which is taken as half the difference between the mismeasurement rates found in dy events and those found in monte carlo .",

    "not currently generated over the entire data run range , we take additional uncertainties on the acceptance for the corresponding signal or background process .",
    "this uncertainty comes from the observed difference in the leading - order @xmath57 acceptance for the corresponding partial run range versus that for the full run range .",

    ", there is an additional uncertainty of 20% from the detector material description and conversion veto efficiency .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath2+jets background contribution is determined from differences in the measured probability that a jet is identified as a lepton for jets collected using different jet @xmath51 trigger thresholds .",
    "these variations correspond to changing the parton composition of the jets and the relative amount of contamination from real leptons .",
    "the cross section calculation uncertainties are 6% on diboson production , 10% on @xmath58 and @xmath49 production , and 5% on drell - yan production .",
    "all signal and background estimates obtained from simulation have an additional 6% uncertainty originating from the luminosity measurement  @xcite .",
    "most systematic uncertainties on the signal processes are assessed using the same techniques described for the background processes .",
    "uncertainties on the theoretical cross sections vary by higgs boson production mechanism .",
    "associated production cross sections are known to nnlo , so the theoretical uncertainty on these cross sections is small , less than 5%  @xcite .",
    "vbf production is known only to nlo , so the residual theoretical uncertainty is higher , on the order of 10%  @xcite .",
    "gluon fusion is a qcd process ; thus the theoretical uncertainty is still significant even though it is known to nnlo .",
    "we use the hnnlo program  @xcite , which computes the theoretical cross section for @xmath69 production at the tevatron to nnlo , to assign theoretical uncertainties due to changing the renormalization and factorization scales ( 11% ) and the gluon pdf model ( 5% ) .",
    "we again use the hnnlo program to evaluate acceptance uncertainties for @xmath69 production for both changes in scale and the pdf model . to evaluate the change in acceptance",
    ", we reweight the higgs boson @xmath28 and @xmath86 distributions obtained from pythia to match the hnnlo calculations . reweighting events based on higgs boson @xmath28 changes the relative acceptances for the jet channels , while reweighting events based on higgs boson @xmath86 primarily affects the lepton acceptance .",
    "to determine the sensitivity we construct a binned likelihood using the six neural network templates shown in figure  [ fig1 ] : two templates each for the os zero and one jet channels ( high s / b and low s / b ) , one template for the os two or more jets channel , and one template for the ss one or more jets channel .",
    "all the signal and background normalizations are allowed to float , but ratios of signal and background contributions are constrained to their expectations with a set of gaussian constraints determined from the systematic uncertainties . the total signal yield is allowed to float .    the 95% c.l .",
    "limits are determined with a set of 50,000 monte carlo background - only experiments based on expected yields varied within the assigned systematics . for each experiment",
    "a test statistic is formed from the difference in the likelihood value for the background - only model versus that for the signal plus background model .",
    "the median expected 95% c.l .",
