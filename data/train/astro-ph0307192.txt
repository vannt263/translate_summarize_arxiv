    "bl  lacertae objects are active galactic nuclei whose most characteristic distinguishing property is their relatively low - luminosity optical line emission ; in many cases , their optical continua are completely featureless . like many high - polarization quasars , bl lacertae objects have strong and variable polarization in wavebands ranging from optical through radio ; they usually have compact , flat - spectrum radio structure , and point - like optical structure .",
    "for some , luminous elliptical host galaxies are observed ( angel and stockman 1980 ; miller 1981 ; kollgaard 1994 ) , though the optical images of many bl lacertae objects remain unresolved , even in high - resolution observations ( e.g. falomo 1996 ) .",
    "the radio emission and much of the optical emission is believed to be synchrotron radiation . historically , bl lacertae objects were first detected primarily via radio surveys , and strong radio emission",
    "was earlier thought to be characteristic of this type of agn .",
    "more recently , large numbers of bl lacertae objects with much weaker radio emission have been discovered by x - ray surveys .",
    "the relationship between these so - called `` radio '' and x - ray \" bl lacertae objects is not entirely clear ; the most popular current hypotheses are ( 1 ) that they are similar objects whose spectral energy distributions peak in the infrared and x - ray , respectively , with the radio emission in radio bl lacertae objects experiencing a larger intrinsic relativistic enhancement ( giommi & padovani 1994 ; padovani & giommi 1995 ; fossati et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and ( 2 ) that they are intrinsically identical objects whose jets are oriented at different characteristic angles to the line of sight , with x - ray bl lacertae objects being viewed further `` off - axis '' ( stocke et  al .",

    "1999 , and references therein ) have revealed a tendency for the electric vector @xmath3 in polarized knots in the vlbi jets to lie nearly along the local jet direction .",
    "the degrees of polarization in the jet components of bl lacertae objects have been observed to be as high as @xmath4 , with typical values @xmath5 , indicating that these components are optically thin and that in at least some cases the magnetic field is very highly ordered . assuming the jet components to be optically thin",
    ", the observed typical @xmath3 orientation implies that the associated magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of the jet .",
    "one natural interpretation of this transverse magnetic field structure is that the visible jet components are associated with relativistic shocks that compress an initially tangled magnetic field , enhancing the magnetic field transverse to the compression ( laing 1980 ; hughes , aller and aller 1989 ) . as images for",

    "below , we will refer to the 3.6  cm images of fc unless explicitly stated otherwise .",

    "unfortunately , the redshift of this source is unknown , so that it is not possible to directly translate these proper motions into apparent speeds .",
    "finally , we have one more tentative speed to report here . at the time of the analysis for our first - epoch 6  cm observations of 0138097 ( gabuzda et  al .",
    "1999 ) , we were not aware that fc had also observed this source at 3.6  cm .",
    "they detected a single jet component 1.9  mas from the core . if this feature should be identified with k2 from gabuzda et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , this implies a proper motion of 0.35 mas / yr , which corresponds to a tentative apparent speed @xmath162 .",
    "our observations have substantially increased the number of objects in the khr & schmidt sample with at least tentative ( two - epoch ) speed estimates .",
    "such estimates are now available for 16 of the 33 sample sources , and are summarized in table  [ tab : speeds ] .",
    "the histogram in figure  [ fig : speeds ] shows the distribution of superluminal speeds in these 16 objects .",
    "when making this histogram , we included more than one entry per source only if apprecially different speeds were observed for different components ( i.e. , only if the speeds fell in different bins ) .",
    "we can see that there is a concentration toward relatively low values , and the apparent speeds are fairly uniformly distributed in the range from @xmath163 , with a possible weak peak near @xmath164 .",
    "we see no evidence from this distribution that the typical jet lorent factors exceed @xmath165 .",
    "there is some evidence for the occurrence of higher superluminal speeds in some bl lacertae objects on the smaller scales probed by higher - frequency observations ( e.g. , marscher & marchenko 1998 ) ; it remains unclear whether the jets of bl lacertae objects in general tend to display higher superluminal speeds on smaller scales .",

    "this paper completes analysis of our first - epoch observations of all sources in the complete sample of bl lacertae objects defined by khr & schmidt ( 1990 ) .",
    "certain tendencies were present even in the earliest vlbi polarization observations of bl lac objects ; however , without systematic observations of a complete sample of objects , it was not possible to say whether these properties were relevant for radio - loud bl lac objects in general , or only to a handful of the best studied sources . on the whole ,",
    "our analysis of the complete sample has confirmed the results of these early observations .",
    "however , it is also clear that the behaviour shown by the sample sources is not entirely uniform .",
    "we summarize our results below .",
    "the vlbi core polarizations of bl lacertae objects are appreciable , with values typically ranging from @xmath172 , and occasionally reaching values as high as @xmath173 .",
    "gabuzda et  al .",
    "( 1994b ) suggested that these relatively high values reflected the dominant contribution of newly emerging jet components . in the case of one source in the sample ",
    "1803 + 784  6  cm space vlbi polarization observations directly showed that the polarized flux was dominated by a compact component in the inner vlbi jet , which was unresolved from the core in ground - based observations ( gabuzda 1999 ) .    the 6  cm vlbi core polarizations of quasars are much lower , typically @xmath12 ( cawthorne et  al .  1993 ) .",
    "this suggests that either the cores of quasars are depolarized ( see , e.g. , taylor 1998 , 2000 ) , or that they are considerably less likely to be dominated by emission from compact new jet components .",
    "if the vlbi cores of quasars are depolarized , we expect that the observed degrees of polarization of the cores of quasars and bl lac objects will become more similar at higher frequencies ; thus far , there is no clear evidence for this , but more systematic studies are required .",
    "thus , it remains a possibility that the vlbi core polarizations of bl lac objects are more often dominated by the contribution of emerging jet components than are the vlbi core polarizations of quasars .",
    "the origin of this systematic difference is not obvious .",
    "one possibility is that the birth rate for new jet components is higher in bl lacertae objects than in quasars , increasing the probability of observing a bl lac object core harbouring new jet components .",
    "there is some evidence from the university of michigan monitoring database that outbursts in bl lacertae objects may be more frequent and well resolved than those in quasars , suggesting that bl lac objects may generate new components more frequently ( m. aller , private communication ) . since the superluminal speeds observed in bl lacertae objects are , on average , slower than those in quasars , it may be that the jet components of bl lacertae objects spend more time in the unresolved core region before becoming detectable as distinct jet knots .",
    "another possibility is that highly - polarized jet components close to the core are often long - lived stationary components whose polarization blends with the true core polarization .",
    "quasi - simultaneous multi - frequency vlba observations for all sources in the khr & schmidt sample currently being analyzed should help distinguish between these various possibilities .",
    "one of the striking tendencies noted in the earliest vlbi polarization results was for the jets of bl lacertae objects to have transverse magnetic fields .",
    "our first - epoch images for the complete khr & schmidt sample confirm that this is the predominant behaviour for the sample as a whole : among the 25 sources in which jet polarization was detected , some 6070% have transverse magnetic fields . at the same time , a sizeable minority of about 30% have longitudinal jet magnetic fields . thus far , transverse magnetic fields have usually been interpreted as manifestations of relativistic shocks in the vlbi jets of these sources , while longitudinal fields have been taken to reflect the presence of shear between the jet and the surrounding medium . in this picture , the common presence of transverse magnetic fields reflects the existence of conditions favorable for the formation of transverse shocks ; the jet components with dominant longitudinal fields would be those in which shocks did not form , or did form but were dominated by the effect of shear .",
    "though it seems likely that many individual , compact , highly - polarized features with transverse magnetic fields are associated with shocks , this does not necessarily imply that _ all _ the observed transverse jet fields should be identified with shock components .",
    "another possibility is that , in at least some cases , we are detecting the toroidal component of an intrinsic helical jet magnetic field ( see , e.g. , gabuzda 1999 ) .",
    "if the dominant magnetic field in the jet is helical , the net observed field can be either transverse or longitudinal , depending on the pitch angle of the field and the viewing angle , though it is more likely that the net observed field will be transverse .",
    "in addition , a longitudinal field component could develop due to interaction between the edges of the jet and the surrounding medium ( e.g. aaron 1998 , laing et  al .",
    "1999 , aloy et  al .",
    "thus , it could be that the dominant magnetic - field component in the vlbi jets of bl lacertae objects is characteristically toroidal .",
    "this could be consistent with the fact that the observed jet magnetic fields are most often transverse , but occasionally longitudinal .",
    "the characteristically modest superluminal speeds observed in the khr & schmidt sources suggest that bl lacertae objects differ from quasars in either the characteristic angles of their jets to the line of sight , or the characteristic intrinsic velocities of components in their jets , or both . the observed apparent speed for a vlbi feature",
    "has a peak for motion at an angle to the line of sight of about @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the lorentz factor of the motion .",
    "therefore , if the intrinsic velocities in the two types of sources were essentially the same , the bl lacertae objects could , in principle , have smaller apparent velocities if their jets were significantly further from or nearer to the line of sight than the jets in quasars .",
    "since bl lacertae objects are obviously highly beamed sources ( kollgaard 1994 , for example ) , it is not reasonable to suppose that their jets could typically be at significantly larger angles to the line of sight than those in quasars . on the other hand , if their jets were significantly _ closer",
    "_ to the line of sight than quasar jets , we would expect bl lacertae objects to be significantly more highly beamed than quasars , and there is no evidence for this ( ghisellini et  al .",
    "thus , the most straightforward interpretation of the more modest superluminal speeds observed in the vlbi jets of bl lacertae objects compared to quasars is that the intrinsic velocities in the bl lac jets are lower .",
    "this seems quite natural in the context of unified schemes linking bl lacertae objects with fr  i and quasars with fr  ii radio galaxies .",

    "<S> estimates of superluminal speeds are presented for several sources , bringing the total number of sources in the sample for which such estimates are available to 16 . </S>",
    "<S> second epoch observations currently being reduced should yield speed estimates for vlbi features in essentially all the sources in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the jet magnetic fields of these bl lacertae objects are usually transverse to the local jet direction , but a sizeable minority ( about 30% ) have vlbi jet components with longitudinal magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> this may suggest that the conditions in the vlbi jets of bl lacertae objects are favorable for the formation of relativistic shocks ; alternatively , it may be that the toroidal component of the intrinsic jet magnetic field is characteristically dominant in these sources .    </S>",
