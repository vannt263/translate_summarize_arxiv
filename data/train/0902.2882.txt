    "detecting redshifted @xmath0 emission with narrow - band imaging is a powerful strategy to seek for galaxies in the early universe . indeed",
    ", many galaxies have been detected through this method in the last decade ( e.g. , cowie & hu 1998 ; rhoads et al .",
    "2000 ; taniguchi et al . 2005 ; murayama et al . 2007 ; ouchi et al . 2008 ) , and they are called @xmath0 emitters ( laes ) .",
    "blobs that extend on super - galactic scale are not considered , and they are treated as a separate population from laes that we focus on . ] because of their strong @xmath0 emission lines , laes can be detected even at very high redshifts , as demonstrated by the fact that the spectroscopically confirmed highest - redshift galaxy so far ( @xmath6 ) was found by this method ( iye et al .",
    "2006 ; ota et al .",
    "moreover , they are an invaluable population to probe the cosmic reionization history because the strength and profile of @xmath0 emissions from laes could significantly be affected because of absorption by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ; e.g. , malhotra & rhoads 2004 ; santos 2004 ; haiman & cen 2005 ; dijkstra et al . 2007a , b ; dayal et al .",
    "2008 ; mesinger & furlanetto 2008 ) .    the physical properties ( such as mass , age or metallicity ) of laes and the connection with other high-@xmath7 galaxy population [ e.g. , lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) ] have been poorly understood because of the faintness of their continua . on the other hand , their statistical properties such as luminosity functions ( lfs ) in terms of @xmath0 emission ( @xmath0 lf ) and rest - frame uv continuum luminosities ( uv lf ) , and @xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) distributions ,",
    "have more firmly been established because of the increase of survey fields and available samples by different authors ( hu et al .",
    "2004 ; kashikawa et al . 2006 ; shimasaku et al . 2006 ; dawson et al .",
    "2007 ; gronwall et al . 2007 ; murayama et al . 2007",
    "; ouchi et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in our previous study ( kobayashi et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter ktn07 ) , we have constructed a new theoretical model for the @xmath0 lf of laes in the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "it is based on one of the latest semi - analytic model for galaxy formation , the mitaka model ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ; see also nagashima et al .",
    "2005 ) , in which galaxies are formed based on the standard structure formation theory driven by cold dark matter .",
    "there are several theoretical models for @xmath0 lf of laes based on analytic models ( e.g. , mao et al . 2007 ;",
    "dayal et al .",
    "2008 ; samui et al .",
    "2009 ) , semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( e.g. , le delliou et al .",
    "2006 ; orsi et al .",
    "2008 ) or cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , barton et al . 2004 ; nagamine et al . 2008 ; dayal et al .",
    "the intrinsic production rate of @xmath0 photons within a galaxy is expected to be proportional to ionizing luminosity and hence it can be calculated if the star formation history ( sfh ) is known",
    ". therefore the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons from the galaxy is the key to predict lae statistics .",
    "however , the escape fraction is difficult to predict theoretically for a realistic configuration of interstellar gas and dust , although there are some theoretical studies to predict it through radiative transfer models in a simplified geometry of interstellar medium ( ism ) and dust ( e.g. , hansen & oh 2005 ; verhamme et al .",
    "hence , most models simply assume a constant escape fraction , which clearly contradicts the recent observational results from local star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , atek et al .",
    "2008 ; stlin et al .",
    "the ktn07 model is unique because the two physical effects are incorporated in calculating the escape fraction : extinction by interstellar dust but with an amount that is different from that for uv continuum , and galaxy - scale outflows induced as supernova feedbacks . in ktn07",
    ", we have shown that our outflow@xmath8dust model reproduces the observational @xmath0 lfs of the laes at @xmath9 .",
    "uv lfs and distributions of @xmath0 ew also provide important statistical information for laes in addition to @xmath0 lfs . in particular , because @xmath0 ew is highly sensitive to sfh , age , and metallicity as well as initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", the observed ew distribution can provide an opportunity to test the validity of the lae models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a detailed and comprehensive comparison between the ktn07 model and the available observations of these statistical quantities at various redshifts .",
    "we will then focus on the two interesting issues described below from our analysis .",
    "the first issue is the existence of very large @xmath0 ew laes .",
    "theoretical models of stellar evolution predict that the maximum @xmath0 ew powered by star - formation activity with the salpeter imf and the solar metallicity is 240   ( e.g. , charlot & fall 1993 ; schaerer 2003 ) . however , observations have revealed that some fractions of lae candidates have higher @xmath0 ews than the maximum ( e.g. , malhotra & rhoads 2002 ; shimasaku et al .",
    "2006 ; dawson et al . 2007 ; gronwall et al . 2007 ; ouchi et al .",
    "although the existence of such high - ew laes has not yet firmly been confirmed because of faint uv continuum flux with large flux errors , such large ew laes could have significant implications for galaxy formation theory .",
    "in fact , these observational results have often been used to argue that some fraction of metal - free stars ( so - called pop iii stars ) and/or a top - heavy imf are required ( e.g. , dijkstra & wyithe 2007 ) . another possibility is the enhancement of ew because of selective extinction for continuum photons by dust in dense clouds ( neufeld 1991 ; hansen & oh 2006 ) , and recent observations give some supports to this interpretation ( finkelstein et al .",
    "2008 , 2009a , 2009b ) . since our model incorporates the effect of extinction by dust",
    ", it is interesting to see whether such an effect can quantitatively explain the large ew laes in our model .",
    "the second issue is the trend of lae ew distributions as a function of uv luminosity . in the rest - frame uv absolute magnitude @xmath10 versus @xmath11 plane",
    ", there is a lack of large ew laes with large uv luminosities , and the maximum ew systematically decreases with increasing uv luminosity ( shimasaku et al .",
    "2006 ; stanway et al .",
    "2007 ; deharveng et al . 2008",
    "; ouchi et al .",
    "this trend in the @xmath12-@xmath11 plane was first reported for lbgs at @xmath13 by ando et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and we here call this feature as the ando effect",
    ". the physical origin of the ando effect is not well understood .",
    "a similar trend has already been known for broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei , which is called as the baldwin effect ( baldwin 1977 ) , but the physical origin can be completely different for the ando effect on galaxies .",
    "ando et al . ( 2006 ) suggested that this relation may be attributed to higher metallicities in the uv - bright galaxies . another possible interpretation proposed by ouchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is that the average stellar population of the uv - bright galaxies is older than that of the uv - faint galaxies .",
    "schaerer & verhamme ( 2008 ) and verhamme et al . (",
    "2008 ) also provided some qualitative predictions to the origin of the ando effect based on the results from their radiative transfer model , but it was not examined quantitatively whether their prediction reproduces observational distribution in @xmath12-@xmath11 plane . on the other hand ,",
    "if the extinction effect by dust is important for the large ew laes as mentioned above , extinction should also be relevant to the ando effect .",
    "we will try to give a new theoretical explanation for the ando effect based on our model .",
    "ktn07 found that , although the @xmath0 lfs of laes can be reproduced by the model at @xmath146 , the model overproduces @xmath0 lfs compared with observations at @xmath15 , because of the rather sudden decrease of the observed @xmath0 lfs at @xmath15 .",
    "ktn07 suggested that this can be interpreted by a rapid increase of igm opacity against @xmath0 photons at @xmath15 , giving an interesting implication for the cosmic reionization .",
    "here we revisit this issue in terms of the increased statistical quantities of uv lfs and ew distributions , and examine the ktn07 s interpretation .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows : in   [ section : model ] , we describe our theoretical model , especially for the uv luminosity and ew calculation .",
    "we compare the model results with the observed lae statistical quantities at various redshifts @xmath16 in ",
    "[ section : comparison ] and discuss about the above two issues . after some discussions including implications for reionization (   [ section : discussion ] ) , the summary will be given in ",
    "[ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the background cosmology adopted in this paper is the standard @xmath17cdm model : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system , and all @xmath0 ew values in this paper are in the rest - frame .",
    "a detailed description of our outflow@xmath8dust model about ly@xmath23 emission from galaxies in the mitaka model is given in ktn07 .",
    "here we briefly summarize the essential treatments about the modeling of @xmath0 emission , and some changes and updates from the ktn07 model .",
    "we consider only ly@xmath23 photons produced by star formation activity .",
    "the ly@xmath23 photon production rate in a star - forming galaxy is calculated from ionizing uv photon ( @xmath24   ) luminosity assuming that all the ionizing photons are absorbed by ionization of hydrogen within the galaxy , and @xmath0 photons are produced by the case b recombination .",
    "the escape fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath25 , from a galaxy is not exactly zero in reality , but it is generally believed to be small ( e.g. , inoue et al .",
    "if @xmath26 , the assumption of @xmath27 in this work is reasonable because the @xmath0 luminosity is proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "the ionizing photon luminosity is calculated using the stellar evolution model of schaerer ( 2003 , hereafter s03 ) assuming the salpeter imf in 0.1100  @xmath29 .",
    "its metallicity dependence is taken into account using the s03 model in a range of @xmath302 .",
    "the gas metallicity of each model galaxy is calculated in the mitaka model . in the quiescently star forming galaxies , which do not experience a major merger of galaxies , we relate the ionizing luminosity simply to star formation rate ( sfr ) , because they are forming stars approximately constantly and the mean stellar age weighted by ionizing luminosity at the time of observation is much smaller than the time scale of sfr evolution .",
    "however , in starburst galaxies triggered by major mergers of galaxies , sfr changes with a very short time scale and hence we exactly calculate ionizing photon luminosity by integrating the sfh .",
    "the observed ly@xmath23 luminosity is determined by the escape fraction , , of produced @xmath0 photons from their host galaxy .",
    "it is difficult to predict @xmath31 of each model galaxy from the first principles in its realistic geometry of ism and interstellar dust because of the resonant scattering of @xmath0 photons .",
    "the photon path could be very complicated depending on clumpiness and velocity fields of ism , and extinction by interstellar dust for @xmath0 photons could be different from that for uv continuum photons .",
    "we introduce a simple model where @xmath31 is separated into two parts : @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the reduction of escaping photons by physical effects not caused by interstellar dust , and the rest of the r.h.s .",
    "is for extinction by dust in the slab geometry [ rybicki & lightman 1979 , eq .",
    "( 1.30 ) ; see also clemens & alexander 2004 , eqs.(1)-(3 ) ] .",
    "there are some physical effects that may reduce @xmath33 from the unity .",
    "one such effect is too many times of resonant scatterings of @xmath0 photons .",
    "when the scattering length is too small in some star forming regions in a galaxy , @xmath0 photons will diffuse out only by random - walk process , and the escape time scale can be extremely long , effectively resulting in a small @xmath33 . it should be noted that a possible deviation of @xmath25 from the assumed value of @xmath27 is also absorbed within @xmath33 .",
    "another effect on @xmath33 is the absorption by neutral hydrogen in igm .",
    "@xmath0 photons that are blueshifted than the rest - frame of their host galaxy will significantly be attenuated by this effect at @xmath34 , while those redshifted will escape freely .",
    "we assume that this effect is independent of redshift at @xmath35 , because we expect that the evolution of absorption is not significant if the @xmath0 line profile is similar for laes at different redshifts",
    ". however , at the very high redshifts of @xmath36 reaching the epoch of reionization , the damping wing effect of igm absorption by the increase of igm neutral fraction may become important , and in this case the damping wing would erase most of @xmath0 photons including those redshifted than the rest - frame of the host galaxy , resulting in a rapid evolution of igm absorption at @xmath15 ( e.g. , fan et al .",
    "therefore we treat the effect of damping wing separately from @xmath33 , by introducing the igm transmission @xmath37 , which is the fraction of @xmath0 photons transmitted after the absorption effect of the damping wing , as done in ktn07 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath37 represents only the effect of the damping wing at @xmath38 , and hence @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "the modest effect of absorption by igm at @xmath41 is effectively included in the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the case of @xmath42 at @xmath15 will be discussed in ",
    "[ section : reionization ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is the effective optical depth of extinction by interstellar dust for @xmath0 photons . here",
    ", the slab type geometry has been assumed for the dust effect rather than the screen type geometry .",
    "ktn07 found that the difference between the models assuming the slab or screen geometries is negligible about lae @xmath0 lf predictions , and we here adopt the slab geometry because it has already been adopted for the dust extinction of continuum photons in the mitaka model . in the mitaka model , the dust optical depth for continuum photons are assumed to be proportional to the metal column density of cold gas , @xmath44 , and we also assume this proportionality for the dust opacity for @xmath0 photons , @xmath43 .",
    "the metal column density can be calculated by the gas mass , galaxy size , and metallicity in the mitaka model .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 is given by @xmath45 with a model parameter @xmath46 that controls the strength of @xmath0 photon extinction .",
    "as mentioned above , this parameter can be different from that for uv continuum photons around 1216   .",
    "we determine this parameter by fitting to the observed @xmath0 lf of laes at @xmath1 ( shimasaku et al .",
    "2006 ) independently of continuum extinction .",
    "we also consider galaxy - scale outflow by supernova feedback as a potential effect that could enhance the escape fraction because the velocity difference of ambient ism produced by outflow may greatly increase the @xmath0 scattering length .",
    "the outflow is considered only for starburst population triggered by major mergers of galaxies , and outflow occurs by supernova feedback .",
    "we identify outflow - phase galaxies in a way consistent with the treatment of supernova feedback in the mitaka model . hence , there are four phases of galaxies in our model : quiescent ( non - starburst ) , pre - outflow starbursts , outflow starbursts , and post - outflow starbursts .",
    "although the distinction of model galaxies into these four phases seems somewhat arbitrary , we have done this based on physical considerations .",
    "briefly , the outflow phase onsets when the energy injected to ism by supernova feedback exceeds the binding energy of ism gas in the galaxy halo , and it continues during the dynamical time scale of halo ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the effective radius of galaxy and the circular velocity of its host halo , respectively ) .",
    "the pre- and post - outflow starbursts are defined as galaxies before and after this outflow phase ( see ktn07 for more details ) .",
    "the galactic wind terminates star formation , and then galaxies in the outflow or post - outflow phases are passively evolving .",
    "we then introduce @xmath50 instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq - fesclya ] ) as @xmath31 in the model galaxies under the outflow phase .",
    "this is motivated by a physical consideration that @xmath31 becomes less sensitive to @xmath51 in such outflowing condition because dust in ism becomes sparse by the outflow and outflow drastically reduces the scattering optical depth of @xmath0 by neutral hydrogen in ism .",
    "finally , we assume that galaxies in post - outflow phase do not produce any @xmath0 emission , because ionizing luminosity should be reduced by the termination of star formation , and there is little amount of interstellar gas to absorb ionizing photons and produce @xmath0 photons within the galaxies .      consequently , there are three model parameters about laes : @xmath52 , @xmath33 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that they are independent of redshift , because these parameters reflect the physics about @xmath0 photon escape , that is independent of redshift . these have been determined in ktn07 by the fit to the lae @xmath0 luminosity function at @xmath1 measured by shimasaku et al .",
    "we found a unique set of the best - fit parameters , which are : @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the model parameters that are not related to laes in the mitaka model are kept at the original values that have been determined by fits to observations of the local galaxies ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ) . as demonstrated by ktn07 ,",
    "the predictions by this model are in overall agreement with observations of lae @xmath0 lfs at various redshifts at @xmath146",
    ". it may be rather surprising , considering the complicated physics about @xmath0 emission , that this simple phenomenological model can explain observations with just three free parameters .",
    "the outflow - phase escape fraction @xmath50 is not much different from @xmath33 , and we get a reasonable agreement with observations even if we set @xmath56 , indicating that the outflow effect is not significant about the @xmath0 escape fraction .",
    "this also means that the effective number of free parameters is further reduced , i.e. , just two .",
    "we will then compare the uv continuum luminosities and ews predicted by this model with observations .",
    "it should be noted that all the model parameters have been determined by nagashima & yoshii ( 2004 ) and ktn07 , and there is no free parameter that can be adjusted to the new data compared in this work .",
    "therefore , the comparison with observations presented below provides an objective test for the validity of the ktn07 framework of lae modeling .      for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we need to calculate uv continuum luminosity of galaxies .",
    "we present uv lfs at the rest - frame wavelength of @xmath571500   .",
    "the unabsorbed ( intrinsic ) uv luminosity at this wavelength is calculated by using the s03 model in a similar way to the ionizing luminosity .",
    "the observable uv luminosity is then calculated taking into account dust extinction .",
    "the amount of extinction magnitude @xmath58 for continuum photons as a function of rest - frame wavelength @xmath59 has been calculated in the original mitaka model , assuming that the optical depth @xmath60 is proportional to the metal column density of cold gas .",
    "the wavelength dependence of @xmath60 is determined by the galactic extinction curve ( pei 1992 ) , and @xmath58 is calculated from @xmath60 assuming the slab type geometry , i.e. , @xmath61 } {      \\tau_d^c(\\lambda ) } \\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proportionality constant between @xmath62 and metal column density has been determined in the mitaka model to fit the observed local galaxies ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ) .    for the starburst galaxies , we expect that their dust opacities are gradually reduced because sn explosions and subsequent galactic wind would heat and remove their interstellar cold gas .",
    "it is difficult to predict analytically the amount of ism left during the starburst activity .",
    "here we simply assume that ism decreases exponentially with an e - folding time of @xmath63 around @xmath64 .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of our result to this prescription by using another model simply assuming no extinction in the outflow and post - outflow galaxies , and we confirmed that our main conclusions are not significantly affected .",
    "it is interesting to compare the extinction of uv continuum photons to that for @xmath0 photons in our model .",
    "both @xmath65 and @xmath60 are assumed to be proportional to the metal column density of ism , and the relation between the two around the  wavelength becomes @xmath66 where @xmath67 is derived from the model parameters in our model .",
    "we note here that @xmath68 is not a new free parameter in our model , because both @xmath43 and @xmath69 have been determined by the modeling described above . the numerical constant @xmath68 in eq .  ( [ eq - taudlya ] )",
    "is called as the _ geometry parameter _ or _ clumpiness parameter _ introduced originally by finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . is slightly different from the original observational definition of @xmath70 by finkelstein et al . see   [ subsec : model_ew ] . ]",
    "the value of @xmath68 effectively reflects the interstellar dust geometry .",
    "the case of @xmath71 means homogeneous ism , in which the resonance scatterings make the photon path of @xmath0 photons much longer than that of uv continuum photons and hence @xmath0 photons suffer from much larger extinction . on the other hand , the case of @xmath72",
    "is regarded as extremely clumpy ism , in which @xmath0 photons are reflected by neutral hydrogen before entering the dense regions where a large amount of dust particles reside .",
    "in such a case @xmath68 becomes smaller than unity , since @xmath0 photons propagate preferentially in low extinction regions , while uv continuum photons go through the dense dusty regions .",
    "detailed theoretical studies solving radiative transfer of @xmath0 photons in such clumpy ism found that this is indeed possible ( neufeld 1991 ; hansen & oh 2006 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath73 derived from our best - fit model implies strong clumpiness of interstellar dust distributions in high-@xmath7 laes .",
    "next we calculate @xmath0 ew of each galaxy in the model described above .",
    "in addition to the _ observable _ ew ( i.e. , dust extinction incorporated into both luminosities of @xmath0 line and uv continuum ) denoted as @xmath11 , it is convenient to define _ intrinsic _ @xmath74 that is simply calculated using the s03 stellar spectra and the salpeter imf , assuming the case b recombination and 100% escape fractions both for @xmath0 and uv continuum photons .",
    "note that all ew values quoted in this paper are in rest frame .",
    "we need to calculate uv continuum luminosity at @xmath75   to estimate ew .",

    "extinctions by dust for @xmath0 photons and continuum photons are treated separately , and the best - fit parameters to @xmath0 lf obtained by ktn07 indicate that the extinction of @xmath0 photons is significantly less effective than that for continuum photons around the @xmath0 wavelength .",

    "it seems that extinction by the clumpy ism is a unique and necessary ingredient to reproduce all of the observed data within the framework our model , if we do not consider somewhat exotic assumptions such as the contribution from pop iii stars or top - heavy imf .",

    "<S> we present theoretical predictions of uv continuum luminosity function ( uv lf ) and @xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) distribution of lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) in the framework of the hierarchical clustering model of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters about laes were determined by fitting to the observed @xmath0 lf at @xmath1 in our previous study , and the fit indicates that extinction of @xmath0 photons by dust is significantly less effective than that of uv continuum photons , implying clumpy dust distribution in interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the predictions about uv lfs and ew distributions with a variety of observations at @xmath236 , allowing no more free parameters and paying careful attention to the selection conditions of laes in each survey . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted uv lfs and ew distributions are in nice agreement with observed data , and especially , our model naturally reproduces the existence of large ew laes ( @xmath3   ) without introducing pop iii stars or top - heavy initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both the stellar population ( young age and low metallicity ) and extinction by clumpy dust are the keys to reproduce large ew laes . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence of ew enhancement by clumpy dust is further strengthened by the quantitative agreement between our model and recent observations about a positive correlation between ew and extinction . the observed trend that brighter laes in uv continuum tend to have smaller mean </S>",
    "<S> ew is also reproduced , and the clumpy dust is playing an important role again for this trend . </S>",
    "<S> we suggested in our previous study that the transmission of intergalactic medium for @xmath0 emission rapidly decreases from @xmath4 to 7 by the fitting to @xmath0 lfs , and this evidence is quantitatively strengthened by the comparison with the uv lf and ew distribution at @xmath5 . </S>"
