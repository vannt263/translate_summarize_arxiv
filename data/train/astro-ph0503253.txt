    "the maximum lithium abundance of main sequence stars of near - solar metallicity spans a small range : @xmath4(li ) @xmath5 3.3 for [ fe / h ] @xmath5 0.0 to 3.1 for [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath80.3 ( lambert & reddy 2003 ) .",
    "this lithium abundance is identified with that of the interstellar gas from which the stars formed .",
    "lithium is predicted to be destroyed throughout a main sequence star except in the outermost layers ( 1%  2% by mass ) . even in this thin skin which includes the atmosphere ,",
    "lithium may be depleted by processes not yet fully understood .",
    "the sun , for example has a lithium abundance about a factor of 100 less than the meteoritic abundance .",
    "when the main sequence star evolves to become a red giant , the convective envelope grows and dilutes the lithium such that its surface abundance is greatly reduced .",
    "iben ( 1967a , b ) predicted that giants of approximately solar metallicity would experience dilution by a factor of 1.8 dex at 3@xmath9 and 1.5 dex at 1@xmath10 .",
    "this dilution occurs at the onset of the first dredge - up resulting from growth of the convective envelope which also results in predicted changes of the surface ( elemental and isotopic ) abundances of helium , beryllium , boron , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen . adopting the predicted lithium dilution and the maximum observed lithium abundance of main sequence stars , lithium in red giants",
    "is expected not to exceed @xmath11@xmath12(li ) @xmath5 1.5 . a red giant star that has evolved through the first dredge - up but has a surface abundance greater than @xmath11@xmath12(li ) @xmath5 1.5 is declared to be ` li - rich ' .",
    "lithium - rich k giants are rare . since the discovery of the first li - rich k giant , hd  112127 , two decades ago ( wallerstein & sneden 1982 ) , the collection of li - rich stars has grown to only about three dozen .",
    "many like hd  112127 were discovered serendipitously .",
    "brown et al . ( 1989 ) undertook a systematic search for li - rich stars among k and late g - type giants .",
    "they found at most ten li - rich giants out of the 670 stars observed . another important survey known as  pico dias survey \" ( pds ) by gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found , as a byproduct , potentially li - rich giants ( de la reza et al .",
    "a few of these pds candidate li - rich k giants have been spectroscopically studied to determine their lithium abundance ( e.g ; reddy et al .",
    "2002a ; drake et al .",
    "2002 ) .    here",
    ", we report results from the first high - resolution spectroscopic analyses of three li - rich candidates taken from de la reza et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who proposed the stars as probably li - rich from the observation that the strength of the lii 6707   doublet was equal to or greater than the strength of the cai 6718    line .",
    "it turns out that the lithium abundances of the three stars are quite different .",
    "the most extreme example is iras 13539 - 4153 ( also known as pds 68 ) with @xmath4(li ) @xmath54.1 , an abundance almost 1 dex higher than the star s likely initial lithium abundance .",
    "the second star iras 17596 - 3952 has @xmath11@xmath12(li ) @xmath5 2.2 and is most probably a li - rich giant , i.e. , a first dredge - up giant with lithium in excess of the limit @xmath11@xmath12(li ) @xmath5 1.5 .",
    "the third star iras 12327 - 6523 has @xmath11@xmath12(li ) @xmath5 1.4 and so is not a certain li - rich star ; it is possibly a post - first dredge - up star with lithium depleted to the predicted level . following presentation and discussion of the abundance analysis , we comment on the similarities between the new and previously known li - rich giants .",
    "spectra of the stars listed in table 1 were obtained with the 4  m blanco telescope and the cassegrain echelle spectograph at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory in chile .",
    "in addition to obtaining spectra of the three li - rich candidates , we obtained a high - quality spectrum of hd 19745 , a li - rich giant analysed previously by de la reza & da silva ( 1995 ) .",
    "the spectrograph was set to cover the wavelength interval 5000    to 8200    without gaps at a resolving power of @xmath13 35,000 .",
    "each star was exposed thrice with a total integration time ranging from 60  min to 90  min .",
    "raw two - dimensional spectra were reduced to one - dimensional wavelength - calibrated spectra using appropriate reduction tools available in the @xmath14 package .",
    "a th - ar hollow cathode spectrum provided the wavelength calibration . in each spectrum of a li - rich candidate star , the signal - to - noise at 6707 is between 100 and 200 .",
    "stellar parameters @xmath0 , @xmath15 , and [ fe / h ] ) were obtained from the spectra by a standard procedure using @xmath16 model atmospheres computed using the no convective overshoot option ( kurucz 1994 ) .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) was obtained from the requirement that all fei lines give the same abundance independent of the lower state s excitation potential ( lep ) .",
    "about 40 fei lines spanning the range leps of 1 to 5 ev were measured for iras 12327 - 6523 and iras 13539 - 4153 but fewer lines were measureable for the rapidly- rotating k giant iras  17596 - 3952 .",
    "lines are weak to moderately strong ( @xmath17 @xmath18 150  m ) .",
    "surface gravity ( @xmath15 ) was obtained with the condition that the fei and feii lines give the same abundance .",
    "the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath19 ) was determined by requiring that the fei lines and nii lines give the same ( fe or ni ) abundance irrespective of their equivalent width .",
    "the parameters were determined by an iterative process using models selected from the @xmath16 grid .",
    "adopted parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "our results for hd  19745 are in good agreement with the previous determination by castilho et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "a full abundance analysis was made with the selected model atmospheres .",
    "lithium abundance and the @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio are discussed below .",
    "seventeen elements from na to nd in addition to fe were included in the analysis . given that [ fe / h ] @xmath20 for the stars which probably belong to the thin disk ,",
    "one expects [ x / fe ] @xmath20 for the 17 elements .",
    "this is what is found to within the measurement errors , except for the suggestion that [ ca / fe ] @xmath21 for iras 12327 - 6523 and iras 13539 - 4153 .",
    "the detailed analysis was not attempted for the rapidly rotating iras 17596 - 3952 .",
    "inspection of the spectra shows two unusual aspects worthy of comment : unusually broad lines of iras  17596 - 3952 , and an asymmetric h@xmath22 profile of iras  12327 - 6523 .",
    "the lines of iras 17596 - 3952 are obviously broader than those of the other two stars which have line widths typical of k giants .",
    "the additional broadening is attributed to a more rapid than average rotational velocity . to determine the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath23 )",
    ", we match the observed spectrum to a synthetic spectrum computed with the following broadening parameters : the velocity @xmath23 , a macroturbulent velocity @xmath24 , and the instrumental profile width .",
    "the value @xmath24 = 3  km s@xmath7 was adopted , as found to be typical of k giants ( gray 1989 ) .",
    "the instrumental profile width was taken as gaussian with a @xmath25 = 0.21    at 6707    as measured from the th emission lines in the hollow cathode spectrum . the non - gaussian form ( gray 1976 ) of the broadening resulting from solid body stellar rotation",
    "is incorporated in the line formation code moog ( sneden 1973 ) .",
    "unblended fei lines at 6703.5   , 6705.1    and 6170    were selected for the estimation of @xmath23 .",
    "a @xmath26-test was used to select the best value of @xmath23 .",
    "the mean value from the fits to the three fei lines is given in table  1 for each star .",
    "profiles of the h@xmath22 line in the four stars and arcturus are shown in figure  1 .",
    "it is clear that iras  12327 - 6523 s h@xmath22 line is distinctly asymmetric with the line core shifted to the blue relative to the photospheric lines .",
    "an asymmetric h@xmath22 line is seen in some other li - rich giants ( drake et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "an immediate indication that the stars might be li - rich was found at the telescope from the obvious presence of a strong absorption line attributable to the lii resonance doublet at 6707.8   .",
    "closer inspection reveals also the presence of the excited lii line at 6103.6    in the spectra of iras  13539 - 4153 and hd  19745 .",
    "lithium abundances were found by spectrum synthesis .",
    "synthesis of the 6707   feature used the critically examined line list in the vicinity of the resonance line taken from reddy et al .",
    "( 2002b ) with the component structure of the lii resonance doublet taken from hobbs , thorburn , & rebull ( 1999 ) .",
    "lithium is assumed to be purely @xmath27li .",
    "the line list for 10    centered on the lii line @xmath28 6707     was tested by successfully reproducing the ultra - high ( @xmath29 @xmath5 150,000 ) resolution spectrum ( hinkle et al . 2000 ) of the very li - poor k - giant arcturus ( see for details : reddy et al .",
    "( 2002a ) ) .",
    "then , synthetic spectra were computed and matched to the spectrum of each program star by adjusting the lithium abundance to fit the 6707.8  feature .",
    "comparisons of synthetic and observed spectra are shown in figure  2 & 3 .",
    "lithium abundances derived from the lte analysis are given in table  2 .",
    "uncertainties in the derived lithium abundances ( table  2 ) are estimated from uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters : @xmath30@xmath0 = 100  k , @xmath31 = 0.5 , @xmath30@xmath32 = 0.5 km s@xmath7 , and @xmath30[m / h ] = 0.25  dex lead uncertainties of 0.25 , 0.05 , 0.05 , and 0.03 dex , respectively .    for iras  13539 - 4153 and hd  19745 , the lithium abundance has been obtained also using the subordinate lii line at 6103   .",
    "the line list for this region was compiled using kurucz s line list ( kurucz 1994 ) . in figure  4",
    ", we compare synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "the lithium abundances ( table  2 ) derived from the 6707    and 6103    lines are in good agreement for hd  19745 , and in good agreement too with previously published results by de la reza & da silva ( 1995 ) .    in figure  2",
    ", we draw attention to a failure to fit the lii 6707   profile of iras  13539 - 4153 .",
    "the line is broader for its depth than calculated : the abundance @xmath4(li ) = 2.35 fits the core but @xmath4(li ) = 4.1 is required to fit the wings , but this abundance produces a central depth greater than observed . the 6103  lii line is matched by the abundance @xmath4(li ) = 4.1 and the @xmath6 of the metal lines .",
    "we suppose that this latter abundance is the stellar abundance and that the 6707  line s core is affected by emission due to chromospheric activity or by non - lte effects .",
    "it is unclear why iras  13539 - 4153 s 6707    line is so affected but hd  19745 s line of comparable strength is not .",
    "( iras  13539 - 4153 s 6707    profile is well fit by increasing the @xmath23 to 16 km s@xmath7 but this broadening fits no other lines in the spectrum ( see figure  2 ) . )",
    "an additional uncertainty arises from our assumption of lte for line formation . for the super li - rich giants hd  19745 and iras  13539 - 4151 non - lte corrections indicate a correction of 0.1  dex upward for the 6103    line and 0.2  dex downward for the 6707    line ( carlsson et al .",
    "for the less lithium - rich stars iras  12327 - 6523 and iras  17596 - 3952 , the non - lte correction is around 0.1  dex upward for the 6707    line .",
    "since these corrections are small and subject to their uncertainties , we include them as part of the overall abundance uncertainty .",
    "( the non - lte abundances are also given in table  2 . )",
    "the total error given in table  2 is the quadratic sum of all the errors discussed above .",
    "standard models make predictions about the first dredge - up s effects on the surface abundances of li , c , n , and o. observations of normal red giants confirm these predictions , qualitatively , if not always quantitatively .",
    "interpretation of lithium abundances is assisted and possibly complicated by knowledge of the c , n , and o abundances . here",
    ", we restrict the analysis to the carbon isotopic ratio @xmath2c/@xmath3c .",
    "one expects an unevolved star to have a ratio close to @xmath2c/@xmath3c @xmath5 90 , the solar photospheric value . a lower ratio ( @xmath5 20 ) is predicted for giants after the first dredge - up .",
    "some giants show even lower @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio .",
    "the @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio was extracted from a complex of @xmath3cn lines at 8005.7    and adjacent @xmath2cn lines ( figure  5 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath2c/@xmath3c is determined by spectrum synthesis assuming solar abundances ( lodders 2003 ) for c and n. for hd  19745 we obtained @xmath2c/@xmath3c = 16@xmath332 which is in good agreement with the ratio of 15 derived by da silva , de la reza , & barbuy ( 1995 ) . for iras 12327 - 6523",
    ", we obtain @xmath2c/@xmath3c = 6@xmath331 .",
    "a limit of @xmath2c/@xmath3c @xmath34 20 was found for iras",
    "13539 - 4153 .",
    "spectral lines of iras  17596 - 3952 are too smeared , due to its high rotation , to estimate the ratio .",
    "the low @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratios confirm that the li - rich giants have experienced the first dredge - up .",
    "when considered with the population of field k giants , our trio stand apart by reason of their high lithium abundance .",
    "that is why they were selected for an abundance analysis .",
    "the question we consider here is how the trio fit in with the previously analyzed li - rich giants .",
    "charbonnel & balachandran ( 2000 ) took advantage of _ hipparcos _ parallaxes to estimate the absolute luminosity of li - rich and li - normal red giants .",
    "they suggested that the li - rich giants could be divided into three clans : warm giants for which lithium dilution has not been completed ; giants at the bump in the luminosity function ; giants in the early phases of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolution  see figure 6 .",
    "our trio ( and hd  19745 ) are not in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue .",
    "therefore , we estimate their luminosities using the spectroscopically - derived @xmath15 and @xmath0 and computed evolutionary tracks for different stellar masses and metallicities ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) . by interpolation",
    ", we found the track ( i.e. , stellar mass ) for which the @xmath15 and @xmath0 best agreed with the observed log @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the luminosity is then read from the track .",
    "estimated luminosities and masses are given in table  1 .",
    "the estimated errors due to uncertainties in model parameters ( @xmath35 = 100  k , @xmath31 = 0.25 , and @xmath36 $ ] = 0.2 ) are shown in table  1 . according to their luminosity and effective temperature",
    "the three stars and hd  19745 have completed the dilution associated with the first dredge - up .",
    "the stars are shown in figure  6 with others from our earlier studies . for stars taken from earlier studies uncertainties of @xmath35 = 100 k and @xmath31",
    "= 0.25 are assumed ( figure  6 ) .",
    "the two most li - rich giants iras  13539 - 4153 and iras 17596 - 3952 belong to the ` bump ' clan . by the spectroscopically estimated luminosity",
    ", we place hd  19745 also among this clan .",
    "the range of lithium abundances , @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratios , and @xmath23 covered by these three stars are spanned by charbonnel & balachandran s six stars : iras  17596 - 3952 s @xmath23 with 35 km s@xmath7 extends the upper limit previously set at 25 km s@xmath7 .",
    "iras12327 - 6523 is assigned to charbonnel & balachandran s ` early - agb ' clan with its original five members with lithium abundances ranging from @xmath4(li ) = 1.5 to 2.8 . iras",
    "12327 - 6523 is now the least lithium rich of the clan .",
    "strictly speaking , the star is not lithium rich because standard dilution by the first dredge - up could have left this relatively massive star with the now observed abundance .",
    "however , standard models of the first dredge - up can not account for the low @xmath3c/@xmath2c ( = 6 ) ratio ; a ratio of 20 - 30 is predicted .",
    "it remains to be shown that the lower than expected carbon isotopic ratio can be achieved by modifications to standard models without severe reduction of the surface lithium abundance .",
    "gregrio - hetem et al .",
    "( 1992 , also gregrio - hetem , castilho , & barbuy 1993 ) found that the great majority of the li - rich giants possess an infrared excess .",
    "drake et al . (",
    "2002 ) noted that every li - rich rapid rotator in a sample of 20 had an infrared excess .",
    "far - ir fluxes from the _ iras _ catalog show that our three stars ( and hd 19745 ) have a strong excess at 12 @xmath37 m and longer wavelengths , as expected from their designation as an iras source .",
    "fluxes estimated from the _ 2mass _ j , h , and k magnitudes show that the ir excess does not extend to these shorter wavelengths .",
    "our three li - rich stars , therefore , continue the correlation between li - richness and ir excess , and , in particular , iras 17596 - 3952 strengthens the impression that all li - rich rapid rotators have a far ir excess .",
    "we have performed the first detailed analysis of three li - rich candidate k giants and a reanalysis of hd  19745 .",
    "two candidates are confirmed as certainly li - rich : iras  13539 - 4153 is among the most li - rich giants yet analysed .",
    "the status of iras  12327 - 6523 as li - rich might be questioned .",
    "three of the four giants ",
    "hd  19745 , iras  13539 - 4153 , and iras  17596 - 3952  belong to rgb - clump collection of li - rich giants and iras  12327 - 6523 belongs to the early - agb collection in the h - r diagram .",
    "this new trio and the other li - rich giants analyzed previously by us confirm that characteristics of the rgb - bump clan that set them apart from other red giants : lithium abundance as high as @xmath38 , a far - infrared excess , and in the mean a high rotational velocity .",
    "charbonnel & balachandran ( 2000 ) linked the rgb - bump clan to the rgb bump where evolution along the giant branch is slowed when the h - burning shell burns through the molecular weight discontinuity left from the initial growth of the convective envelope which provided the first dredge - up .",
    "( the li - rich giants at higher luminosity and of higher mass were associated with a molecular weight discontinuity predicted to occur in early - agb stars as a result of the second dredge - up . ) .",
    "erasure of the molecular weight gradient makes it possible for ` extra ' mixing to occur between the convective envelope and the top of the h - burning shell . mixing results in the conversion of @xmath39he to @xmath27be and then @xmath27li by the cameron - fowler ( 1971 ) mechanism .",
    "this extra mixing may be internally or externally triggered .",
    "a proposed trigger should explain the concentration in luminosity of the li - rich giants , the tendency for li - rich giants to be rapid - rotators and the association with a far infrared - excess .",
    "a reader challenged to take up the search for the trigger might profitably read the proposals advanced by palacios , charbonnel , & forestini ( 2001 ) and denissenkov & herwig ( 2004 ) .",
