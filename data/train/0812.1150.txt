    "searches for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are motivated by the coming together of unification schemes , such as supersymmetry , which predict new particle species , and extensive observational evidence which demonstrates the need for additional non - baryonic gravitational mass within the universe . that the wimps of supersymmetry naturally fulfill this need is remarkably persuasive .",
    "indeed , wimps occur in other frameworks too . as a generic class of particle",
    "they are assumed to only interact non - gravitationally with baryonic matter via the weak interaction .",
    "whilst this offers a mechanism for energy transfer and hence detection , it also implies rather low event rates and energy deposits : @xmath60.1  events / day / kg and @xmath650  kev respectively .",
    "this dictates the use of sensitive underground experiments capable of specifically identifying energy deposits due to elastic scattering of incoming particles from target nuclei .",
    "zeplin - iii is the latest in a progressive series of instruments designed to push steadily the sensitivity limits by exploring alternative approaches using xenon - based targets  @xcite .",
    "zeplin - iii is a two - phase ( liquid / gas ) xenon time - projection chamber specifically designed to search for dark matter wimps .",
    "its design and performance details have already been presented elsewhere  @xcite and only a brief reminder is given here .",
    "the experiment is operating 1100  m underground .",
    "the active volume is a disc of 35  mm thickness and @xmath0190  mm diameter which contains @xmath012  kg of liquid xenon above an array of 31 2-inch diameter photomultipliers ( pmts ) .",
    "the pmts employed during this first science run were etl d730/9829q",
    "@xcite , and they were used to record both the rapid scintillation signal , s1 , and a delayed second signal , s2 , produced by proportional electroluminescence in the gas phase above the liquid  @xcite . the pmt array was immersed in the liquid viewing upwards .",
    "the electric field in the target volume was defined by a cathode wire grid 36  mm below the liquid surface and an anode plate 4  mm above the surface in the gas phase .",
    "these two electrodes alone produce the drift field in the liquid ( 3.9  kv / cm ) , the field for extraction of the charge from the surface , and the electroluminescence field in the gas ( 7.8  kv / cm ) . a fiducial volume for wimp searches was defined by using a time window for delays between s1 and s2 , which selected a depth slice within the liquid , and by 2-d position reconstruction from the pmt signals to select a radial boundary at 150  mm .",
    "the time window was set between 500  ns and 13,000  ns which selected depths between 1.29  mm and 33.43  mm .",
    "these together defined a fiducial volume containing 6.5  kg of xenon .",
    "+ the pmt signals were digitised at 2ns sampling over a time segment of @xmath7s either side of the trigger point .",
    "each pmt signal was fed into two 8-bit digitisers ( acqiris dc265 ) with a @xmath8 gain difference between them provided by fast amplifiers ( phillips scientific 770 ) , to obtain both high and low sensitivity read - out covering a wide dynamic range .",
    "the pmt array was operated from a common hv supply with attenuators ( phillips scientific 804 ) used to normalise their individual gains .",
    "the trigger was created from the shaped sum signal of all the pmts . for nuclear recoil interactions",
    "the trigger was always caused by an s2 signal for energies up to s1=40  kevee , where kevee is an energy unit referenced to the equivalent s1 signal produced by 122  kev @xmath9-rays from @xmath10co .",
    "the trigger threshold was @xmath011 ionisation electrons and this corresponded to @xmath00.2  kev for electron recoils ( for nuclear recoils see section  [ ec ] ) .",
    "this s2 threshold was set to avoid excessive triggers from single electron emission events and from electron and nuclear recoils whose primaries would otherwise have been undetectable as they fall below the s1 detection threshold .",
    "+ the xenon target was contained within a vessel itself located within a vacuum jacket both made from low - background oxygen - free copper .",
    "cooling was provided by a @xmath11litre liquid nitrogen reservoir , also made from copper , inside the vacuum jacket . thermal stability to @xmath60.5  @xmath12c was achieved over the entire run by controlling the flow of cold nitrogen boil - off gas through the base - flange of the xenon vessel . pressure stability to 2%",
    "was maintained .",
    "the zeplin - iii detector was completely surrounded by a shield of @xmath13 cm thick polypropylene and @xmath14 cm thick lead , giving @xmath15 attenuation factors for both @xmath9-rays and neutrons from the cavern walls .",
    "dedicated access through the shield was provided for the radioactive calibration source delivery , instrument levelling screws and pipe - work to the external gas purification system .",
    "wimp - search data were collected over 83  days of continuous operation in the boulby laboratory starting on @xmath2 february 2008 .",
    "an 84% live time was achieved during the science run and some @xmath16kg@xmath1days of raw data were collected from the @xmath17 kg target volume .",
    "@xmath10co calibration measurements were made every day .",
    "nuclear recoil calibrations were made with an ambe neutron source at the beginning and end of the 83  day period ( 5  hrs each ) .",
    "a typical event , from a neutron elastic scattering interaction in the liquid with s1=5  kevee , is shown in figure  [ event ] as recorded through the high - sensitivity sum channel .",
    "a short compton calibration was performed using a @xmath18cs source at the beginning of the run with a much longer run at the end ( 122  hrs ) .",
    "ten percent of the science data ( every @xmath19 file ) were used to develop initial data analysis and selection cuts , to establish the level of the electron - recoil background , and to define the boundaries for the wimp - search box and its acceptance . at first",
    ", the remaining 90% of the science data were retained unopened to carry out a ` blind ' analysis , but these data were eventually used for perfecting some data - selection cuts as detailed below , making the final analysis non - blind .",
    "+   +    pulse - finding algorithms were used to identify signals in the 62 waveforms ( independently for each pmt and for high and low sensitivity channels ) .",
    "these were then categorised as s1 or s2 candidates based on a pulse width parameter ( charge mean arrival time , @xmath20 ) : scintillation pulses are much shorter ( @xmath20@xmath2140  ns ) than electroluminescence pulses , with durations corresponding to the drift time across the gas gap ( @xmath20@xmath0550  ns ) .",
    "viable s1 and s2 candidates were then subject to software thresholds ( @xmath223 channels recording signals above @xmath23  photoelectron ( p.e . ) for s1 and a minimum area of @xmath05  ionisation electrons for s2 ) .",
    "only events with one s1 and one s2 were considered for further analysis .",
    "of particular note here , @xmath24 goodness of fit indicators within the position reconstruction of both s1 and s2 were used to remove multiple - scatter events , and this was particularly effective for those with one vertex in a ` dead ' region of the xenon , which would otherwise have been a troublesome background .",
    "such ` dead ' regions include the reverse - field volume between the cathode wire and the pmt grid wire @xcite and the thin ( 0.5  mm ) layer of xenon surrounding the pmt bodies .",
    "double - compton interactions with at least one vertex in these regions , referred to as ` multiple - scintillation single - ionisation ' ( mssi ) events , fulfil the previous selection criteria since there is no s2 pulse from the dead region and the coincident scintillation pulses are added together in a single s1 .",
    "unfortunately , perfecting this selection eventually required use of the full data - set as will be described in more detail below .",
    "an external @xmath10co source was inserted through the shield and located above the instrument every day .",
    "the dominant 122  kev @xmath9-rays have a photoelectric absorption length of 3.3  mm in liquid xe , and hence provided good standard calibration candles from interactions close to the liquid surface .",
    "a typical @xmath10co spectrum is shown in figure  [ co57 ] .",
    "the s1 signal channel exhibited a light detection efficiency at our operating field ( 3.9  kv / cm ) of @xmath25=1.8  p.e./kevee , decreasing from 5.0  p.e./kevee on application of the electric field .",
    "the 122  kev interactions were used for a number of purposes to calibrate the instrument . using s2 pulses , an iterative procedure , whereby a common cylindrical response profile was fitted to each channel , was used to normalise the measured response from each pmt ( i.e.  ` flat - field ' the array ) .",
    "position reconstruction in the horizontal plane was then achieved by using the converged response profiles in a simultaneous least - squares minimisation to all channels  @xcite .",
    "this method complements the monte carlo template matching procedure also being used but is less dependent on accurate iterative simulations  @xcite .",
    "finally , the integrated areas of the s1 and s2 responses gave light collection correction factors as a function of radial position . using this procedure a full - volume energy resolution of @xmath26=5.4% at 122",
    "kev was obtained with an energy reconstruction using a combination of the s1 and s2 responses to reflect the fact that , for electron recoils , these two channels are anti - correlated at a microscopic level .",
    "the individual s1 and s2 resolutions at 122  kev are 16.3% and 8.8% , respectively . also shown in figure  [ co57 ] is the comparison of the response to simulation .",
    "not only are the two main @xmath10co lines well fitted but there is also a good match to the predicted compton feature at @xmath035  kev .",
    "the excess above 150  kev is mainly due to the unsubtracted background .",
    "the left - hand panel in figure  [ co57_pos ] shows the distribution in the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane of events seen from the source . as expected most events",
    "are located towards the centre ( the offset is due to an offset source position ) with a radial fall - off as expected from the increasing thickness of copper along the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath10co daily calibrations were used to assess the evolution of other operational parameters over the entire run : i ) the average light and ionisation yields , as measured by fits to the @xmath10co s1 and s2 pulse area spectra ; ii ) the mean electron lifetime in the liquid , obtained from the exponential depth dependence of the ratio of the areas of the s2 and s1 signals ( hereafter simply referred to as @xmath29 ) ; iii ) the evolution of the long - term detector tilt due to local geological factors , as given by the polar dependence of the s2-width distribution , which probes the thickness of the gas layer . the detector tilted by less than 1  mrad over the run . over the fiducial volume",
    "this corresponds to a systematic change in the gas gap of @xmath30% , which in turn translates proportionally into a variation in the s2 signal .",
    "this was not deemed sufficient to warrant a full correction  .",
    "the scintillation mean light yield remained stable to a few percent , as did the ionisation yield , after correcting for the electron lifetime in the liquid .",
    "remarkably , the lifetime did show an evolution during the run in the form of an improvement : from an initial value of 20  @xmath31s , achieved by initial gas - phase purification through external getters , a value of 35  @xmath31s had been reached by the end of the run ( the full drift length of the chamber is only 14@xmath32s ) .",
    "there was no active recirculation used and this improvement is attributed to the clean , xenon - friendly materials used in detector construction and to the uninterrupted application of the electric fields during the entire run . as the area ratio @xmath29 is the main discriminant between nuclear and electron recoils , a depth - dependent correction must be applied to the s2 area to compensate for electron trapping by impurities .",
    "the electrons from the deepest events within the fiducial volume drifted for 13@xmath32s and the correction factor for these varied from 1.92 at the start of the run to 1.45 at the end .",
    "the daily @xmath10co calibrations allowed this to be monitored throughout the science run and events were corrected individually using an historical trend profile .",
    "the linearity of the response of each channel in the array was investigated using low - energy compton - scattered events from the @xmath18cs source , in order to rule out hardware and software distortion for processing of small signals .",
    "the position of the vertex for each interaction was found and the waveforms from pmts located a certain distance away from the vertex were selected based on the expected number of s1 photons , given the cylindrical response profile determined from the @xmath10co data as pointed out in [ co57_cal ] .",
    "provided that the expected number is indeed small , the mean of the poisson distribution for the number of detected photons can be quite accurately determined by counting the fraction of waveforms which do not contain any identified pulses , i.e. the frequency characterising the absence of any signal .",
    "this assertion is made against a sample of pure noise in the same waveform . repeating this procedure for all channels and a range of expected signal allowed comparison of the mean s1 pulse area recorded in each trial against the expected poisson mean , as shown in figure  [ pmtlin ] for the central pmt . in addition , this provides a very robust method to obtain the mean size of one photoelectron @xcite .",
    "this has been calculated for every pmt within the array :    the relationship is found to be linear to within the statistical accuracy of the measurement over a factor of 10 in mean pulse area , which covers the range of interest for wimp nuclear recoil signals . the slope of the line in figure  [ pmtlin ] provides a measure of the mean single photoelectron response ( ser ) for that pmt .",
    "the mean ser of all the pmts in the array has been found in this way to be in the range @xmath33  pvs .",
    "the spread in these values forms part of the ` flat - field ' correction discussed earlier ; other dominant factors are the pmt quantum efficiency and imperfect hardware equalisation .",
    "the nuclear recoil response in the energy range of interest to wimp signals has been calibrated with neutrons from an ambe ( @xmath34,n ) source .",
    "the source was placed inside the polypropylene shielding above the detector but displaced to one side to reduce the interaction rate .",
    "the right - hand panel in figure  [ co57_pos ] shows the reconstructed event positions from the second calibration performed just after the science run had been completed .",
    "the distribution is slightly non - unform in the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane as expected .",
    "figure  [ ambe_s2s1 ] shows a ` scatter - plot ' of @xmath35 as a function of energy in kevee from the ambe calibration .",
    "the red line shows a smooth fit to the median of the elastic scatter distribution with @xmath36 boundaries as blue lines . to obtain these curves",
    "the data were histogramed into 1  kevee bins and fitted by log - normal distributions .",
    "examples of the quality of the fits are shown in figure  [ ambe_slice ] .",
    "the other well defined population in figure  [ ambe_s2s1 ] , between 4070  kevee , is due to inelastic scattering of neutrons from @xmath37xe nuclei and the more diffuse horizontal population is caused by associated @xmath9-ray interactions .",
    "the elastic nuclear recoil median turns out to be very closely approximated by a power law , which is shown most effectively by replotting the figure in log - log form ( figure  [ ambe_s2s1log ] ) . not only is the power - law behaviour very apparent but it can also be seen that there is less obvious flaring at lower energies than seen in other xenon experiments whose data were taken at much lower electric fields  @xcite . also shown are lines illustrating the approximate thresholds for s1 and s2 .",
    "the electron recoil response at low energies was established using a long duration calibration with a @xmath18cs radioactive source .",
    "compton scattering of the @xmath38  kev @xmath9-rays produced a significant number of events down to @xmath39  kevee but with only a small number extending far enough down in the @xmath29 parameter to reach the nuclear recoil median ( figure  [ cs137_scatter ] ) .",
    "the general behaviour of the electron recoil band is reminiscent of the xenon10 results @xcite , but with a slightly more pronounced upturn at low energy , a larger separation between electron and nuclear recoil bands and narrower distributions .",
    "the low - energy electron - recoil populations in the @xmath18cs and the wimp - search data - sets were fitted in 1  kevee bins by a skew - gaussian function .",
    "the fits were performed using a maximum likelihood ( ml ) method with a poisson distribution as estimator for the observed data .",
    "three of the fits are shown in figure  [ ambe_slice ] .",
    "the distribution parameters are consistent bin - by - bin for the @xmath18cs and wimp data - sets , as confirmed in figure  [ cs137_scatter ] . however , there are two distinct differences in the general behaviour .",
    "firstly , the mean of the @xmath18cs data is systematically lower than that of the wimp  data .",
    "it has been shown that this reduction is due to the high count rate used in collecting the cs data causing the gain of the pmts to be slightly suppressed due to saturation effects at low - temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not feasible to lower the rate and still acquire sufficient data in a reasonable time and uncontaminated by other background . secondly , the behaviour of the @xmath18cs data - set in the low @xmath29 tails is not closely representative of the science data , with the former exhibiting significantly more outliers .",
    "these events are attributed to mssi double - compton events as had been anticipated in  @xcite .",
    "this is not evident in figure  [ cs137_scatter ] as the number of events concerned was not sufficient to affect the standard deviation noticeably .",
    "+ double - compton events in which both vertices are within the active volume produce two primary signals which are time coincident , but separated in position , and two secondary signals which are separated in both time ( delay ) and position .",
    "even if they can not be separated they are of no consequence as the combined ratio of @xmath29 will be relatively unaffected . however",
    ", if one of the vertices occurs in a position from which no secondary is possible , then the only way to identify them is through positional mismatch between s1 and s2 and a less well reconstructed position from s1 as this has two vertices .",
    "if the ` dead ' vertex is very close to one of the pmt surfaces the s1 signal can also appear to be too peaked within the array . although there were already specific software cuts designed to deal with these events , some with certain topologies were not being fully identified by our analysis at that stage . for the @xmath18cs data this problem was most apparent in the region @xmath40@xmath41 and @xmath42  kevee but extended right down to the lowest energies .",
    "the @xmath18cs calibration data were thus used to improve our algorithms for identifying mssis and the new routines were implemented after the science data had been opened . however , even with the improved selection cuts it was still not possible to use the @xmath18cs data to predict accurately the expected number of single - scatter events leaking into the nuclear recoil region .",
    "the combination of lowering of the band mean ( due to the rate dependent pmt sensitivity suppression at low temperature ) towards the nuclear recoil band and remaining additional events in the lower wing caused a large over - prediction of event leakage into the wimp search box ( 41 events were predicted ) .",
    "the additional events remaining in the lower wing were probably due to the @xmath18cs source not accurately mimicking that of the background sources due to its location . hence , instead of using the @xmath18cs data ,",
    "the wimp - search data themselves were used to estimate the expected electron - recoil backgrounds , and this gave 11.6@xmath433.0 .",
    "the raw data were reduced using the purpose - developed code ze3ra ( zeplin - iii reduction and analysis ) . the daq hardware records the 62 waveforms at 500  ms / s ( 2  ns samples ) for 36  @xmath31s periods .",
    "ze3ra finds candidate pulses in individual waveforms by searching for 3  _ rms _ excursions above the baseline .",
    "subsequent waveform processing includes resolving adjacent / overlapping pulses and grouping of statistically consistent structures ( e.g. scintillation tails ) . a statistically - motivated timing / shape coincidence analysis was then used to correlate occurrences on different channels thus allowing further pulse interpretation ( e.g. clustering , identification of random coincidences , etc . )",
    "the resulting pulses were ordered by decreasing area in the high - sensitivity ( hs ) sum channel and the largest 10 were stored in databases for further analysis . by design , ze3ra does not ascribe physical meaning to pulses , it rather parameterises them in terms of arrival time , width , area , amplitude , etc .",
    "an event browser allows visual scanning of events , channels or individual pulses ; a batch - mode interface allows scripted reduction of large data - sets .",
    "the data structures produced by ze3ra were analysed by a flexible code based on hbook  @xcite .",
    "it processed the original parameters to assign physical meaning to pulses in events according to a well defined set of rules ( e.g. primary scintillation signals are fast and must precede wider electroluminescence signals ) .",
    "only events that can represent single scatters in the two - phase target ( ` golden ' events with one s1 and one s2 ) were retained .",
    "primary ( s1 ) pulses were found by applying an acceptance threshold of 1/3 p.e . to the ze3ra pulses and also requiring a 3-fold coincidence amongst the 31 pmts .",
    "this software threshold was nominally equivalent to an energy threshold of 1.7kevee .",
    "exceptions in the s1 selection were allowed for pmt after - pulses .",
    "these are signal - induced artifacts generated within the pmts .",
    "in general they have a characteristic time delay from the optical signal , but with a wide distribution and , moreover , it varies between pmts . as a result",
    "it is not trivial to identify after - pulsing and avoid them instead being classified as additional s1 signals , which would result in the event being wrongly rejected .",
    "secondary ( s2 ) pulses were required to have at least an integrated area corresponding to the signal expected from about 5 electrons leaving the liquid surface .",
    "this suppresses optically - induced single - electron emission  @xcite as well as optical feedback effects from the cathode grid , which are not part of the direct measure of the ionisation signal generated at the interaction site .",
    "many additional parameters are derived for these , such as 3-d position information , hit - pattern descriptors , interaction energy and corrections ( e.g. array flat - fielding , electron lifetime , liquid level , light collection , etc ) .",
    "subsequent analysis ( science exploitation ) is based on paw  @xcite and root  @xcite .",
    "+ trapping mssi events effectively was a significant challenge , involving a combination of approaches : use of goodness of fit indicators in the position reconstruction algorithms , comparison of coordinates derived independently from s1 and s2 , and searching for abnormal light patterns across the array .",
    "discrimination between nuclear and electron recoils is illustrated in figure  [ disc ] which combines electron recoil data from @xmath18cs and elastic nuclear recoil data from ambe .",
    "the separation between the two populations is clear and this is used as the main way of defining the nuclear recoil search box for potential wimp events .",
    "the selection cuts used can be categorised as follows :    1 .",
    "golden event selection ( including pulse finding , s1 and s2 definition , and single scatter selection ) 2 .   waveform quality cuts ( mild cuts mainly aimed at large baseline excursions compromising pulse parameterisation ) 3 .",
    "pulse quality cuts ( mild cuts to avoid extreme outliers in parameter distributions ) 4 .",
    "fiducial volume definition ( drift time window and a radial limit from the s2 position reconstruction ) 5 .",
    "event quality cuts ( strong cuts to deal with mssi events mainly )    the fiducial definitions ( 4 ) leave an active mass of 6.52 kg with a raw exposure of 453.6kg.days .    low - energy events in the 10% data were well separated from the nuclear recoil median line down to the lowest energies .",
    "the wimp search box boundary was thus defined as @xmath44@xmath6@xmath45@xmath616  kevee and @xmath46@xmath6@xmath47@xmath6@xmath48 , where @xmath48 is the energy - dependent mean of the nuclear recoils ( acceptance of 47.7% ) .",
    "this region was defined before unblinding and was kept for the subsequent analysis .",
    "the effective total exposure within this box , after taking account of all of the efficiencies , as detailed in table  [ efftab ] , is 127.8  kg@xmath1days .",
    "electron and nuclear recoil background predictions for zeplin - iii are based on a full geant4  @xcite simulation including measured radioactive content levels for all major components@xcite .",
    "the largest contributor , by far , is the pmt array .",
    "figure  [ gback ] shows the measured differential background spectrum together with the simulated background .",
    "the high - energy region above 300  kevee is suppressed due to dynamic range limitation .",
    "the expected single - scatter neutron background in the data - set is @xmath49 in the wimp search box with 90% coming from pmt generated events through ( @xmath34,n ) interactions and spontaneous fission .",
    "the remaining 10% are mainly from contaminants in ceramic feedthroughs and external leakage through the shield of neutrons from the rock .",
    "figure  [ fsr ] shows the final scatter plot from the complete science data - set .",
    "there are 7 events within the wimp search box and the energy scale is shown in kevee . to assess the implications of these events the energy scale needs to be converted into kevnr , the energy dependent detector efficiency for nuclear recoils must be found and the relative likelihood of any of those 7 events being drawn from the expected wimp distribution rather than the extended electron - recoil distribution must be calculated .",
    "the level of discrimination apparent in figure  [ fsr ] is very high .",
    "as derived from the data themselves , the average @xmath9-ray rejection factor is 5@xmath5010@xmath51 between 216  kevee with an increase below 5  kevee .",
    "this is significantly better than had previously been demonstrated by the xenon10 experiment  which achieved 99.9% at the very lowest energies  @xcite whilst our data exhibit better than 99.99% in the 2 - 5kevee band .",
    "figure  [ rad_wimps ] shows the spatial @xmath27-@xmath28 distribution of all events in the 216  kevee energy range .",
    "events within the wimp search box are highlighted .    to derive the significance of the events within the search box",
    "the experiment efficiency must be derived together with the energy scale conversion between kevee and kevnr .",
    "these are established in the following sections .",
    "first the efficiency for nuclear recoil detections is found by comparing ambe data - sets with very different trigger thresholds in both hardware and software .",
    "the energy scale conversion is then done by comparing a simulation of the expected nuclear recoil with that measured .",
    "the overall detection efficiency will be a combination of hardware and software effects . as mentioned earlier in section  [ 1b ] the hardware trigger threshold",
    "is derived from s2 in the low - energy part of the s1 spectrum relevant to wimp signals . at higher energies , well beyond the upper limit of the wimp search box",
    ", there is a high - level inhibit to suppress the overall count rate , but this does not affect the efficiency at low energy .",
    "dead - time effects are usually energy independent .",
    "software effects include thresholding associated with pulse finding algorithms and selection cuts .",
    "these have been described in section  [ 1c ] .",
    "the energies ( expressed in s1  kevee ) at which these ` thresholds ' will affect the detection efficiency are tabulated in table  [ efftab ] . in order to confirm these expectations a second ambe",
    "data - set was analysed as a check on the energy dependence near the threshold .",
    "this data - set had been acquired with a lower hardware s2 trigger threshold .",
    "in addition , the 3-fold s1 coincidence requirement was changed to 2-fold in this particular analysis and all quality cuts removed or significantly relaxed .",
    "the overall effect of these two changes is shown in figure  [ ambe_spec ] by comparing the black histogram labelled ` am - be low - threshold data ' with the blue shaded histogram labelled ` am - be calibration data ' .",
    "the difference between these two histograms is only noticeable below s1@xmath04  kevee as expected .",
    "a study of the smallest s2 events triggering the system in each run has shown directly that the trigger level in the two runs was @xmath011 and @xmath04 ionisation electrons , respectively .",
    "these numbers were calibrated against the measured single electron spectrum for zeplin - iii following the method already used for zeplin - ii  @xcite .",
    "the experiment efficiency during the science run is taken as the ratio of the two ambe data - sets , shown in figure  [ nlin ] .",
    "the full red curve labelled ` simulation ( eee / enr=2.09 ) ' in figure  [ ambe_spec ] shows a monte carlo simulation of the expected differential spectrum which should have been seen by the experiment assuming a constant ratio between s1  kevee and s1  kevnr .",
    "this simulated curve has not been corrected for instrument efficiency but even so it is clear that there is a departure from the experimental data below s1  @xmath52  kev .",
    "given that this mismatch extends so far in energy above any reasonable thresholding effects , it is interpreted as evidence for a non - linear scale conversion .      a comparison between the differential spectrum seen during the nuclear - recoil calibration , using ambe , and a monte carlo simulation has been used to derive the energy scale conversion between kevee and kevnr .",
    "this relies on the integrity of the simulation using geant4 , which is very well established in general for elastic scattering of neutrons , and which has been further extensively validated as part of this work .",
    "systematic effects related to the simulation of the experimental calibration were assessed .",
    "these included , amongst others : variations in neutron source spectrum and source location inside the shield ; the effect of intervening and surrounding materials ; simulation event selection ; energy resolution smearing ; coincident ambe @xmath9-rays ; treatment of inelastic scattering in xenon .",
    "the monte carlo result at low recoil energies was very resilient to sensible variation of these parameters .",
    "a different monte carlo code @xcite confirmed these results independently .",
    "naturally , incorrect angular cross - sections for elastic scattering off xenon could be invoked to explain the low - energy result , since enhancing forward scattering would soften the recoil spectrum . however , dedicated simulations confirmed the correct implementation of the endf / b - vi evaluated data libraries @xcite which underpin the geant4 low - energy neutron transport models .",
    "both angular and energy - differential cross - sections were found to be in agreement with endf / b - vi and similar databases .",
    "an implementation in geant4 of the more recent endf / b - vii data for xenon by the xenon10 team  @xcite , aimed at exploring the causes of a similar effect observed by that experiment , found only minor differences in the recoil spectrum produced by a similar neutron source .",
    "we have independently confirmed this conclusion .",
    "the comparison between simulation and experiment for zeplin - iii is shown in figure  [ ambe_spec ] .",
    "the energy scale associated with the simulated data has been converted from kevnr to kevee in figure  [ ambe_spec ] by simply dividing by 2.09 , to allow for the combination of the relative nuclear - recoil scintillation efficiency to that of a 122kev @xmath9-ray at zero electric field , @xmath53 , and a suppression factor , @xmath54 , which allows for the field - dependent variation in the scintillation output .",
    "these are used in the following equation : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the suppression factors in the scintillation output for 122kev @xmath9-rays and nuclear recoils , respectively , at the experiment operating fields . note that in this equation the ratio @xmath58 defines the kevee unit . above",
    "@xmath59@xmath020  kev",
    "the available experimental data for @xmath53 suggests it is constant at @xmath00.19  @xcite .",
    "however a variation in @xmath53 at low energy has been invoked to explain xenon10 neutron calibration data  @xcite and hence is allowed to vary in this work .",
    ".[efftab]energy - independent efficiency factors and thresholds due to hardware and software actions .",
    "efficiency figures are constant over the wimp recoil range .",

    "cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in general the conversion between an electron - equivalent energy scale , in kevee , and a nuclear recoil energy scale , in kevnr , is not necessarily linear and any non - linearity can be expressed mathematically through energy dependency in @xmath60 and/or @xmath61 . above @xmath59@xmath0@xmath62",
    "kev the available experimental data for @xmath60 suggests it is constant at @xmath00.19 . at lower energies",
    "the situation is much less clear  @xcite . for @xmath57",
    "there are no data on the energy dependence but rather there is a single value based on a measurement at 56  kevnr using a neutron beam  @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath63 at our field and it is commonly assumed to remain constant over the whole energy range of wimp nuclear recoils .",
    "if @xmath60 and/or @xmath57 are not constant below @xmath020  kevnr this will cause a non - linearity in the nuclear recoil energy scale .    in the following it",
    "is assumed that such non - linearities are responsible for the mismatch seen in figure  [ ambe_spec ] .",
    "the approach used is similar to that applied to the xenon10 data  @xcite . using a maximum - likelihood technique",
    "we have derived a non - linearity function which best matches the ambe simulation to our neutron calibration spectrum above @xmath02  kevee .",
    "the outcome of this process is shown as the dashed red curve in figure  [ ambe_spec ] .",
    "figure  [ nlin2 ] expresses the nonlinearity in terms of the combined effect of @xmath60 and @xmath57 , with the latter referenced to 0.90 . in figures  [ ambe_spec ]  and  [ nlin ]",
    "the top horizontal axes show the energy scale in kevnr to be compared with kevee on the bottom scale .",
    "the wimp search box boundaries then translate to 10.7 and 30.2  kevnr .",
    "one consequence of the required non - linearity is a marked reduction in efficiency for nuclear recoil detection below 15  kevnr .",
    "the event box contains a large empty region with a small number of events close to where a tail from the electron recoil distribution is expected .",
    "however , although there is a good fit of a skew - gaussian distribution to the electron - recoil band above the wimp search box , there remains systematic uncertainty about an extrapolation of this being used as an accurate estimator of the number of expected background events in the box .",
    "the fact that the best fit expectation exceeds the measured number of events might result in an artificially lower upper limit , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this compromises any straightforward use of maximum - likelihood techniques and even the commonly - used feldman - cousins ( fc )  analysis @xcite .",
    "hence , a simpler , more transparent and conservative approach is adopted based on a minimum of three pieces of information about the data .",
    "the first is the reasonable assumption that any expected electron - recoil background will fall in the top part of the wimp search box .",
    "based on this assumption the box is divided into two regions which have significantly different probabilities of having electron - recoil background within them .",
    "this is done in figure  [ bins ] after transforming the wimp  search box so that the vertical axis has a linear scale in nuclear recoil acceptance percentiles as derived from the ambe calibration data . in this representation",
    "any wimp  nuclear recoil signal should populate the box uniformly , whereas the density of the electron recoil background is expected to decrease monotonically down from the top .",
    "a horizontal dashed line is shown which divides the wimp search box into two regions such that the top area contains all the events . in the following analysis the fractional area in the lower region",
    "is denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "the second is the observation that no wimp  event is seen in the lower region ( @xmath65 ) .    finally , it is possible that there may be up to 7 wimp events in the upper region ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "a classical 90% one - sided upper limit for the wimp expectation value in the whole box , @xmath31 , is the value under which 10% of repeated experiments would return zero events in the lower box and up to 7 in the upper box .",
    "this is expressed in terms of poisson probabilities as @xmath67 over the range of values of @xmath64 between 0.75 and 0.84 the calculated result is @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is the maximum area allowed which just excludes all of the events .",
    "it turns out that , for the value of @xmath31 resulting from this calculation , the second factor in equation ( 2 ) is very close to unity regardless of the area fraction , @xmath64 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the upper limit is driven almost entirely by the presence of the empty region and the value 2.30 is then recognised as the classical 90% upper limit on zero .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume that the two - sided 90% confidence interval for this particular data - set will also be driven by the empty box . in this case",
    "the upper limit to this interval will be at @xmath70 , with 2.44 being the corresponding 2-sided fc  upper limit on zero @xcite .",
    "figure [ bins ] shows a dividing line with @xmath71 , which is adopted as a conservative boundary placement beyond which no background is likely",
    ". the 90% confidence interval upper limit is then @xmath72 . with this extreme value of @xmath31",
    "there is a 54% probability that there are indeed no wimp  events in the upper region , a 33% chance of there being 1 wimp event and a 13% chance of @xmath73 wimp events .",
    "the fact that the most likely scenario is no wimps in the data - set even with @xmath72 implies that @xmath74 is included within the 90% two - sided interval as the null event hypothesis becomes more and more likely as @xmath31 is reduced .",
    "the upper limit of 3.05 events is used to derive the upper limit to the wimp - nucleon spin - independent elastic scattering cross - section as a function of wimp mass .",
    "the signal energy distribution is obtained from the theoretical wimp recoil spectrum  @xcite , derived using the standard spherical isothermal galactic halo model ( @xmath75=0.3  gev@xmath76 , @xmath77=220  km / s , @xmath78=600  km / s and @xmath79=232  km / s ) , detector response efficiencies and energy resolution .",
    "the form factor is taken from  @xcite .",
    "the expected distribution in @xmath29 is determined from the neutron calibration .",
    "the final result for the 90% confidence interval upper limit to the cross - section , shown in figure  [ res ] , has a minimum of 8.1@xmath5010@xmath80  pb for a wimp mass of 60  gev/@xmath81 . in the mass range beyond 100",
    "gevc@xmath5 this result complements the xenon10 result and further constrains the favoured susy parameter space  @xcite from xenon - based experiments .",
    "spin - dependent limits are presented separately  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of 847  kg@xmath1days of data from the first science run of zeplin - iii has resulted in a signal lower limit consistent with zero , and an upper limit on the spin - independent wimp - nucleon elastic scattering cross - section of @xmath82pb , at 90% confidence level . in reaching this result",
    "it was necessary to confront an unexpected mismatch between the nuclear recoil spectrum shown in the ambe calibration data and the monte carlo simulation . a careful and thorough analysis of efficiency factors and threshold effects ( including the use of alternative data - sets with different thresholds , systematic changes to software cuts and thresholds , visual scanning and manual analysis of large samples of data and modelling and direct verification of the performance of the daq ) did not resolve this mismatch . as a more credible alternative explanation",
    "the possibility of a non - linearity in the nuclear recoil energy scale has been studied .",
    "non - linearity as such is not unexpected and , indeed it would be surprising if it did not exist at low energy , and a similar approach has been used by others for xenon  @xcite . using this analysis it has been possible to reconcile the data with a non - linearity setting in at the same energy as in @xcite but with a more significant effect at lower energies . in itself this",
    "may not be surprising given the very different operating conditions within zeplin - iii and xenon10 : the most obvious being that the electric field in the liquid is 6 times stronger in the former .",
    "indeed , there are other clear differences in the performances of the two instruments .",
    "however , it is clear that the physics underlying the low - energy performance is poorly understood .",
    "this is true of both the response to electron recoils  @xcite and to nuclear recoils  @xcite . as a point of reference , if the mismatch between the ambe simulation and the data were interpreted solely as an instrument efficiency , the effect on the upper limit would not have been dramatic ( @xmath640% increase ) as this approach has a better effective threshold for nuclear recoils but a poorer efficiency .",
    "the analysis presented is not blind as one of the analysis routines was changed after opening of the full data - set as was the limit setting procedure . in applying the limit analysis no use was made of any background estimates ( neither electron - recoil or neutron scattering ) and this was done deliberately to avoid underestimating the upper limit .",
    "the uk groups acknowledge the support of the science & technology facilities council ( stfc ) for the zeplin - iii project and for maintenance and operation of the underground palmer laboratory which is hosted by cleveland potash ltd ( cpl ) at boulby mine near whitby , on the north - east coast of england",
