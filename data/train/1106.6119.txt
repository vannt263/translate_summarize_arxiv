    "there are three sources of @xmath4 violation in the lowest - dimension operators of the standard model . due to its flavor - changing properties ,",
    "the phase of the ckm matrix is the best known and investigated source ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the recent discovery of neutrino masses opens up the possibility of analogous leptonic @xmath4 violation @xcite .",
    "the third possible source comes from the @xmath5 term in qcd @xcite .",
    "flavor - conserving quantities , in particular hadronic , nuclear , and atomic electric dipole moments ( edms ) , are sensitive probes of this qualitatively different mechanism of @xmath4 violation .",
    "edms require the simultaneous violation of parity ( @xmath6 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath7 ) ; for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "years of careful experimental investigation have set stringent bounds on the neutron edm , @xmath8 cm @xcite .",
    "this upper limit points to a tiny value for the @xmath0 parameter , @xmath9 , despite the naive - dimensional - analysis expectation that it be of @xmath10 . besides the neutron edm",
    ", there are measurements on atomic edms .",
    "the leading contribution in a paramagnetic system comes from the edm of the unpaired electron .",
    "in contrast , a diamagnetic atom has zero total electron angular momentum , and the main contribution to the atomic edm comes from the nuclear schiff moment ( sm ) , the residual electron - nucleus interaction generated by the distribution of the edm throughout the nuclear region .",
    "a less stringent bound on the proton edm , @xmath11 cm , is extracted from the edm of the @xmath12hg atom @xcite through a calculation of the nuclear sm @xcite .",
    "atomic edms can also receive contributions from higher nuclear moments that violate @xmath7 , such as the magnetic quadrupole moment ( mqm ) .",
    "the unnaturally small value of @xmath0 leaves room for other flavor - diagonal sources of @xmath7 violation , which have their origin in physics beyond the standard model , at a high - energy scale @xmath13 .",
    "well below the new physics scale , these effects manifest themselves in interactions between standard model fields represented by higher - dimension @xmath7-violating ( tv ) operators , suppressed by more and more powers of @xmath13 .",
    "we expect the most important tv effects to be captured by the operators of lowest dimension @xcite , the dimension-6 quark electric and chromo - electric dipole moments ( qedm and qcedm ) , gluon chromo - electric dipole moment ( gcedm ) , and tv four - quark ( fq ) operators .",
    "a recent renewal of the longstanding interest in edms comes from a new generation of experiments , which will improve the precision of edm observables significantly .",
    "it is expected that the current bound on the neutron edm will be pushed down to @xmath14 cm @xcite using high - density ultra - cold neutron sources at sns @xcite and ill+psi @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that the edm of charged particles could be measured in storage - ring experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition to the proton , we could see a measurement of the deuteron edm with a projected precision of @xmath15 cm .",
    "a measurement on @xmath16he is also a possibility .",
    "these measurements probe dimension-6 sources at scales comparable to the scale reached at the lhc , so they could very well turn up positive signals .    calculating hadronic and nuclear edms ( and higher moments ) directly from qcd with tv sources is a daunting task , although progress has been made for nucleons , in the case of @xmath0 , using lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to use a low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) of qcd , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite ( for a review , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    ", we can describe hadronic and nuclear observables in a controlled expansion with minimal dynamical assumptions , where the symmetries of qcd in particular the chiral @xmath17 symmetry for two quark flavors are respected order by order .",
    "while the simplest @xmath7-violating ( tv ) interactions have been known for a long time @xcite , a comprehensive analysis similar to the well - known @xmath7-conserving ( tc ) sector of the tv chiral lagrangian from the @xmath0 term @xcite and the dimension-6 sources @xcite has only been performed recently .    in the case of the nucleon edm",
    ", one finds that , for @xmath7 violation from the @xmath0 term , the leading contributions come from the pion cloud , where the pion couples to the nucleon via a non - derivative @xmath6- and @xmath7-odd interaction , and from shorter - range interactions .",
    "the former is purely isovector , and provides an estimate of the edm : the characteristic @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the pion mass , is not expected to be canceled by short - range contributions and thus provides the bound on @xmath0 mentioned above @xcite .",
    "one can extend the calculation to the full electric dipole form factor ( edff ) as well @xcite , where in leading orders the radius , a contribution to the nucleon sm , is predicted @xcite .",
    "however , because of two possible short - range structures , isoscalar and isovector , even measurements of both neutron and proton edms would be insufficient to determine the three unknown parameters that appear at leading order .",
    "when dimension-6 sources are included in the picture , one finds that the qcedm generates a nucleon edff that is not distinguishable from the one stemming from @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while the momentum dependence of the edff is qualitatively different if the qedm or the gcedm , rather than @xmath0 or the qcedm , are the dominant sources of @xmath7 violation , a measurement of the neutron and proton edms alone can be fitted equally well by any of these sources .",
    "it is clear , then , that to pinpoint the dominant mechanism(s ) of @xmath7 violation at high energy , more observables are needed , and nuclear edms are natural candidates .",
    "nuclear edms and other moments receive various contributions .",
    "there are , of course , contributions from the individual nucleons edms . in the deuteron",
    "the isovector component cancels , while in @xmath16he one can expect a cancellation between the contributions of the two nearly anti - aligned protons .",
    "thus , nuclear edms , in particular the deuteron s @xcite , are sensitive to a different combination of hadronic tv parameters than the neutron edm .",
    "however , these one - nucleon contributions are modified from their `` in - vacuum '' counterparts because the nucleons are not free but bound in the nucleus .",
    "there are many - nucleon effects that are tv .",
    "first , the tv component of the pion cloud can generate a tv pion - exchange interaction among nucleons , and no symmetry forbids interactions of shorter range , either .",
    "these tv nuclear forces will mix - in components of the nuclear wave function that do not appear in the absence of tv .",
    "it is a source of polarization effects for the entire nucleus .",
    "second , there may be multi - nucleon contributions to the tv coupling of the photon ; such tv currents can be generated by either pion exchange or shorter - range dynamics .",
    "tv one - pion exchange ( ope ) has long been recognized as an important component of the tv two - nucleon ( @xmath20 ) potential , and expressed @xcite in terms of three non - derivative pion - nucleon couplings @xcite , associated with isospin @xmath21 .",
    "so far , the analysis of tv nuclear effects has been based on tree - level potentials where ope is sometimes supplemented by the single exchange of heavier mesons , the eta @xcite , rho @xcite , and omega @xcite being most popular . allowing sufficiently many couplings of these mesons to nucleons one can produce @xcite the most general short - range tv @xmath20 local interaction with one derivative @xcite .",
    "this is the tv analog of the ddh approach @xcite for nuclear tc @xmath6 violation ( pv ) .",
    "the contributions from such potentials to the deuteron and @xmath3he edms have been calculated in the literature under various assumptions .",
    "ope from the @xmath22 tv pion - nucleon coupling does not contribute to the @xmath20 system at tree level .",
    "it was noticed early on @xcite that ope from the @xmath23 tv pion - nucleon coupling does not contribute to the deuteron edm , either , but it does for @xmath3he , where it was estimated with a phenomenological strong - interaction potential @xcite .",
    "the deuteron edm that arises from an @xmath24 tv exchange of either pion- or shorter - range , together with a separable strong - interaction potential , was calculated in ref .",
    "the effects of ope on the deuteron edm and mqm were calculated using both zero - range and phenomenological strong - interaction potentials in ref . @xcite .",
    "more recent calculations of the deuteron edm and mqm @xcite and of the @xmath3he edm @xcite have considered other tv contributions besides those from the tv potential , and used more modern , `` realistic '' strong - interaction potentials .",
    "meson - exchange currents were found small in the deuteron @xcite , and neglected in @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "the tv - potential contributions are consistent with earlier results ; they are dominated by ope from the @xmath24 pion - nucleon coupling in the case of the deuteron @xcite , and from all three pion - nucleon couplings in the case of @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "tv moments of heavier nuclei are more difficult to calculate . it has been argued @xcite that the tv potential can lead to an enhancement over the nucleon edm thanks to the near - degeneracy of levels of opposite parity , while meson - exchange currents are comparatively small . the size of the effect can be estimated through the single - particle potential obtained by averaging the @xmath20 potential over a closed nuclear core .",
    "the ope from the @xmath25 pion - nucleon couplings are proportional to the nuclear @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xcite , while the ope from the @xmath24 coupling does not have such a suppressing factor @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that the matrix elements from the rho and omega are small compared to the @xmath24 pion contribution @xcite .",
    "edms and mqms ( for example from @xmath23 ope @xcite ) and sms @xcite of several interesting nuclei have been estimated .",
    "a sample of recent sm calculations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are , of course , other nuclear tests of tv , see for example ref .",
    "the most promising for effects of the tv nuclear interaction seems to be neutron scattering @xcite . on the proton @xcite and deuteron @xcite ,",
    "tv neutron scattering is again dominated by ope , but sensitive mostly to the @xmath25 and @xmath28 couplings , respectively . for heavy nuclei ,",
    "one can again obtain estimates using the single - particle potential @xcite .    for consistency , we would like to describe nuclear tv observables in the same framework used for the calculation of the nucleon edm . the non - analytic behavior of the nucleon edm in @xmath19 and the dominance of ope in nuclear observables point to the need of a framework that can account for both effects simultaneously , with chiral symmetry playing a central role .",
    "in fact , different sources of @xmath7 violation have different transformation properties under chiral symmetry . as a consequence , the relative importance of various pion - nucleon and short - range interactions is not the same for all sources .",
    "here we use the chiral lagrangian built in refs .",
    "@xcite , where tv interactions stemming from the @xmath0 term and the dimension-6 sources were constructed and ordered according to the same power counting used to order tc interactions in chpt .",
    "in addition to consistency between one- and few - nucleon tv interactions , nuclear tv also requires consistency between tv and tc forces , in order there to be no mismatch in the off - shell behaviors of the various ingredients . of course",
    ", off - shell effects are dependent on the choice of fields , while physical quantities are not , provided the same choice of fields has been made throughout the calculation .",
    "as far as tv nuclear interactions are concerned , phenomenological tc models bring additional uncertainties , such as the choice of zero - range or finite - range interactions and the role of heavy mesons . on the other hand",
    ", chpt has been extended to multi - nucleon systems @xcite , leading to the derivation of tc nuclear forces and currents .",
    "this opens up the possibility of describing all necessary ingredients in a single framework .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide the first step in the extension of tv interactions in the eft to the multi - nucleon sector where ope is treated non - perturbatively .",
    "some of us have recently looked at the deuteron s pv , tv electromagnetic moments in an eft where pions are treated in perturbation theory @xcite . in this case",
    ", the size of uncertainties is set by the relatively low scale where ope becomes significant .",
    "treating ope non - perturbatively extends the eft to higher momenta and improves convergence .",
    "the tv nuclear potential is the most important ingredient in this extension , and here we derive it for the most important tv sources .",
    "this is the tv potential to be used , for example , with the tc , parity - conserving ( pc ) potentials from refs .",
    "the construction here is similar to that of the tc pv potential @xcite , which extends the eft from the tc , pv one - nucleon sector @xcite to multi - nucleon systems .",
    "such a framework provides an alternative to the ddh approach @xcite , allowing for a model - independent analysis of nuclear tc pv phenomena @xcite .",
    "our present tv pv eft framework stands in respect to previous approaches like this tc pv eft framework with respect to the ddh approach .    as we are going to see , the form of the tv potential at a given order in the chiral expansion depends on the source . for the dimension-6 sources , all non - derivative pion - nucleon couplings appear at leading order ,",
    "although these sources differ in the relative strength of the @xmath22 pion - nucleon coupling and short - range interactions . for these sources ,",
    "the leading - order potential is sufficient for most applications we envision .",
    "the situation is different for the @xmath0 term : only the @xmath23 pion - nucleon coupling , which is suppressed in some cases of interest , appears at leading order . for this source",
    ", we thus derive the potential up to subleading order .",
    "we show that new elements appear with respect to phenomenological treatments , such as two - pion exchange ( tpe ) at the same level as short - range interactions representing heavier - meson exchange .",
    "this richness is a blessing , as it potentially reveals the tv source @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "[ chpt ] , we present a summary of basic chpt ideas and give the tc and tv chiral lagrangians needed in the following sections . for processes involving momenta below @xmath29 mev ,",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "qcd is characterized by an intrinsic mass scale @xmath31 gev . at momenta",
    "@xmath32 comparable to the pion mass , @xmath33 , interactions among nucleons and pions are described by the most general lagrangian that involves these degrees of freedom and that has the same symmetries as qcd . a particularly important role at low energy is played by the approximate symmetry of qcd under the chiral group @xmath34 .",
    "since it is not manifest in the spectrum , which instead exhibits an approximate isospin symmetry , chiral symmetry must be spontaneously broken down to the isospin subgroup @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding goldstone bosons can be identified with the pions , which provide a non - linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking strongly constrain the form of the interactions among nucleons and pions . in particular , in the limit of vanishing quark masses and charges , when chiral symmetry is exact , pion interactions proceed through a covariant derivative , which in stereographic coordinates @xmath36 for the pions is @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 mev the pion decay constant .",
    "one can also construct the covariant derivative of this covariant derivative , @xmath40 and so on .",
    "nucleons are described by an isospin-1/2 field @xmath41 , and we can define a nucleon covariant derivative @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , are the pauli matrices in isospin space .",
    "we also define @xmath45 through @xmath46 , and use the shorthand notation @xmath47 and @xmath48 when acting on a nucleon bilinear of non - zero isospin , for example @xmath49 , the covariant derivative is meant to be in the adjoint representation , that is , the isospin matrix in eq . should be replaced by @xmath50 .    at @xmath51 , the nucleon mass , nucleons are essentially non - relativistic ; as such the only coordinate with which their fields vary rapidly is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the nucleon velocity , @xmath54 in the nucleon rest frame .",
    "it is convenient therefore to use a heavy - nucleon field from which this fast variation has been removed @xcite .",
    "this simplifies the gamma - matrix algebra , leaving only the spin operator @xmath55 , where @xmath56 in the nucleon rest frame .",
    "below we use the subscript @xmath57 to denote the component of a four - vector perpendicular to the velocity , for example @xmath58 baryon states above the nucleon , such as the delta isobar , can be included in eft along similar lines , but for simplicity we do not include them here .",
    "the chpt lagrangian in the chiral limit includes all the interactions made out of @xmath59 , @xmath41 and their covariant derivatives that are chiral invariant .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken , however , which introduces pion interactions that might not include derivatives , but are proportional to powers of the symmetry - breaking parameters .",
    "since the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry is small , chiral - symmetry - breaking operators can be systematically included as a perturbation on the chiral - invariant lagrangian .",
    "their forms are also not arbitrary , being instead determined by the chiral transformation properties of their progenitors in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the construction of chiral - symmetry - breaking operators from quark masses and `` hard '' electromagnetic interactions ( those from photons with momenta beyond the eft regime ) is extensively treated in refs .",
    "`` soft '' interactions via an explicit photon field @xmath60 appear in gauge - covariant derivatives , @xmath61 n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the proton electric charge , and in gauge - invariant interactions built from the photon field strength @xmath63    approximate chiral symmetry , together with the heavy - baryon formalism , allows us to systematically expand observables in the mesonic and one - nucleon sectors in powers of @xmath64 , where @xmath32 is the typical momentum of the process under consideration .",
    "the chpt lagrangian contains an infinite number of terms , which can be organized using an integer `` chiral index '' @xmath65 and the number @xmath66 of fermion fields @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the number of derivatives , powers of the pion mass or of the electric charge . for processes with at most one nucleon , @xmath70 , all momenta and energies are typically @xmath71 . the contribution of a diagram to the amplitude @xmath7",
    "can then be estimated by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a calculable function , @xmath74 is the renormalization scale , and the counting index @xmath75 is @xmath76 here , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are respectively the number of connected pieces and loops in the diagrams , and @xmath79 counts the number of insertions of vertices from @xmath80 . from eq .",
    "it is apparent that diagrams with increasingly higher number of loops and non - vanishing - index interactions are increasingly suppressed , leading to a perturbative expansion .",
    "assigning to loops a characteristic factor @xmath81 and using naive dimensional analysis @xcite to estimate the eft parameters , the suppression scale is @xmath82 .",
    "note that in this sector of the theory nucleon recoil is a subleading effect : the nucleon is nearly static .",
    "the chpt power counting formula can not directly be applied to processes with @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "indeed , in diagrams in which the intermediate state consists purely of propagating nucleons which are called `` reducible'' the contour of integration for integrals over the 0th components of loop momenta can not be deformed in way to avoid the poles of the nucleon propagators , thus picking up energies @xmath84 from nucleon recoil , no longer a subleading effect , rather than @xmath71 .",
    "there is also an extra factor of @xmath85 .",
    "these diagrams are therefore enhanced by factors of @xmath86 with respect to the chpt power counting that assigns @xmath81 to a loop , and the need to resum them leads to the appearance of shallow bound states in systems with two or more nucleons , nuclei .",
    "diagrams whose intermediate states contain interacting nucleons and pions ``irreducible'' do not suffer from this infrared enhancement , and in them nucleon recoil remains a small effect .",
    "reducible diagrams are thus obtained by patching together irreducible diagrams with intermediate states consisting of @xmath87 free - nucleon propagators .",
    "calling @xmath88 the sum of all irreducible diagrams , the amplitude can be written schematically as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the free - nucleon , non - relativistic green s function .",
    "equation is just the lippmann - schwinger equation , which is formally equivalent to a schrdinger equation with a potential @xmath88 .",
    "naive dimensional analysis suggests @xcite that irreducible diagrams follow the chpt power counting rule with @xmath91 .",
    "while this is true for pion - exchange diagrams , the situation is more complicated for contact interactions .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the iteration of the singular one - pion exchange requires for renormalization at the same order a finite number of @xmath92 interactions , some of which are less suppressed than expected on the basis of naive dimensional analysis @xcite . on the other hand , corrections , which should be perturbative , are expected to still conform to dimensional analysis @xcite . since the tv potential is very small , it should be amenable to an expansion in powers of @xmath64 , with different contributions organized according to their chiral index @xmath75 , or , equivalently , according to the number of inverse powers of @xmath93 .    in sect .",
