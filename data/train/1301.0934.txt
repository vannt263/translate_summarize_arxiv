    "uncovering causal interdependencies from observational data is one of the great challenges of nonlinear time series analysis @xcite . while detecting statistical interrelationships between interacting systems",
    "is comparably simple and can be achieved by many linear as well as nonlinear methods such as cross - correlation , mutual information @xcite , or synchronisation analysis @xcite , the correct identification of coupling direction is still faced with numerous practical problems @xcite .",
    "existing methods for this purpose include linear granger causality @xcite as well as nonlinear extensions thereof @xcite , information - theoretic quantities like transfer entropy @xcite or conditional mutual information @xcite , and state - space based characteristics such as conditional probabilities of recurrences @xcite , to mention only a few examples . in general , all methods proposed so far make explicit use of _ dynamical _ characteristics , and it is still a matter of scientific debate which method performs best under specific conditions . in turn , the potential _ geometric _ consequences of directed couplings in the shared phase space of interacting dynamical systems have not been explicitly studied so far .",
    "this work presents a first attempt to a corresponding structural characterisation .    in the last years",
    ", several approaches for analysing time series from dynamical systems by means of graph - theoretical concepts have emerged  @xcite ( see @xcite for a corresponding review ) . among these different approaches , networks based on the mutual proximity of state vectors in phase space",
    "have become increasingly popular , since their structural properties are closely related to the geometry of the underlying attractor and , hence , the resulting dynamics .",
    "one particularly important class of proximity networks in phase space are recurrence networks  @xcite , which are especially useful for characterising the structural properties of low - dimensional systems . recall that the property of recurrence ( in the sense of poincar ) corresponds to geometrical closeness in phase space without the necessity of trivial temporal correlations .",
    "this closeness can be characterised in different ways , including neighbourhoods of individual states with fixed probability mass ( @xmath1-nearest neighbour approach ) or with a fixed phase space volume ( determined by a maximum spatial distance @xmath2 of neighbouring states ) . in the latter case , the recurrence properties obtained from a particular realisation ( i.e. , a  possibly multivariate  time series ) @xmath3 representing the relevant degrees of freedom of a complex system @xmath4 are encoded in the binary recurrence matrix @xmath5 where @xmath6 measures some distance ( e.g. ,  according to the euclidean or maximum norm ) in phase space , and @xmath7 denotes the heaviside function .",
    "the visualisation of this symmetric matrix is known as the _ recurrence plot _",
    "@xcite , and the emergence of line structures in such recurrence plots has been intensively utilised for characterising the dynamical properties of the underlying time series by estimates of dynamical invariants and novel measures of complexity ( _ recurrence quantification analysis , rqa _ )  @xcite .",
    "recurrence network analysis reinterprets the recurrence structure of a time series as the connectivity pattern of an associated complex network represented by an undirected simple graph @xcite .",
    "specifically , given the definition in eq .",
    "( [ def : epsrec ] ) based on @xmath2-recurrences , we can formally write @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is kronecker s delta ) to obtain the adjacency matrix of the corresponding @xmath2-recurrence network ( we will abbreviate this term by rn in the following ) . the properties of such networks have been widely studied elsewhere  @xcite , and their practical use as an exploratory tool of time series analysis has been demonstrated  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "global properties of rns have been shown to trace dynamical transitions in non - stationary time series  @xcite .",
    "a particularly relevant , yet straightforward characteristic is the edge density @xmath10 which equals ( for a rn ) the recurrence rate @xmath11 of the underlying time series .",
    "we emphasise that there is a simple monotonic relationship between @xmath12 and the recurrence threshold @xmath2 . in the context of rns  @xcite",
    "( but also other spatially embedded graphs such as climate networks  @xcite ) , it has been argued that a suitable resolution of small - scale network features requires the choice of a low edge density , typically @xmath13 , confirming earlier suggestions provided for recurrence plots @xcite .    in previous research",
    ", the concept of rns has only been applied for the analysis of single ( uni- or multivariate ) time series or for the characterisation of individual dynamical systems , whereas the underlying recurrence plot concept has been complemented by bi- and multivariate extensions @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we provide one possible framework for bi- and multivariate rn analysis and discuss its potentials for detecting the coupling direction between two or more complex dynamical systems .",
    "although our considerations are particularly made for rns , similar conceptual developments should be possible for other types of recurrence networks ( e.g. , @xmath1-nearest neighbour networks ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we present our methodological approach to a joint treatment of multiple time series in a rn framework .",
    "the associated characteristics describing some fundamental structural properties of general coupled networks ( sometimes also referred to as interconnected , interdependent , interacting or _ network of networks _",
    "@xcite in the literature ) are reviewed .",
    "subsequently , we outline how these properties can be used for characterising possible geometric signatures of coupling between dynamical systems .",
    "the proposed framework is then illustrated for two diffusively coupled rssler systems as a paradigmatic example in section 3 .",
    "the effects of different dynamical regimes , the emergence of generalised synchronisation , and the lengths of the available time series on the detectability of the true coupling direction are discussed in some detail .",
    "in addition , a real - world example from climatology is presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , the main conclusions from our work are summarised in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent realisations of two dynamical systems @xmath4 and @xmath16 observed at distinct times @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , respectively , which do not need to be the same for both systems .",
    "this is , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "if both systems share a common phase space ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath16 represent the same physical quantities ) , we can consider a distance between individual observations ( state vectors ) of both systems as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a suitable norm ( e.g. , euclidean norm ) in phase space .",
    "then , the cross - recurrence matrix is @xcite @xmath25 unlike the univariate recurrence matrix @xmath26 , @xmath27 is in general not symmetric and not even necessarily a square matrix ( i.e. , @xmath28 is possible ) . as in the univariate case",
    ", the cross - recurrence rate @xmath29 is an important characteristic of the cross - recurrence matrix @xmath27 that increases montonically with @xmath30 .",
    "the statistical distribution of line structures in the associated cross - recurrence plot ( crp ) can be utilised for defining bivariate measures of complexity to study interrelationships between possibly coupled dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "however , this point of view typically requires that the sampling of both systems is comparable , since otherwise , line structures are difficult to define .    from a conceptional perspective , we have to emphasise that for the formal applicability of crps , the two studied systems must share the same ( reconstructed ) phase space , i.e. , they need to have the same set of dynamically relevant variables @xcite .",
    "although there is no formal proof that this prerequisite provides a generally applicable sufficient or even necessary condition , it provides a reasonable working basis that can be considered as being typically met when comparing observations with the same physical meaning , such as temperature records from two distant observatories or eeg measurements from different electrodes . in turn , in many real - world problems , one is rather interested in studying interrelationships between two physically different quantities , for which this requirement is not fulfilled .",
    "however , in many applications , the resulting conceptual problems have been widely ignored by rendering the respective phase spaces of two systems quantitatively similar by means of suitable monotonic transformations of the data ( e.g. , standardisation to zero mean and unit variance @xcite , quantile adjustment , or distinguishing positive and negative interdependencies @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative solution has been proposed by using order patterns , which allows us to directly compare time series in terms of their local rank order @xcite , but destroys much of the quantitative information usually contained in recurrence plot - based techniques .",
    "consequently , results based on the intercomparison of two structurally different variables by means of crps should always be interpreted and discussed carefully .      in the following ,",
    "we combine the information on recurrences within the individual dynamical systems @xmath4 and @xmath16 ( i.e. , `` intra - system '' recurrences , eq .  ( [ def : epsrec ] ) ) with that on their respective cross - recurrences ( i.e. , proximities between pairs of states of both systems , eq .  ( [ def : crp ] ) ) in an _ inter - system recurrence matrix _",
    "@xmath31 with @xmath2 being a common threshold for defining the spatial proximity between the state vectors of each as well as both systems .",
    "@xmath32 can also be derived as the standard recurrence matrix of the concatenated observations @xmath33 . moreover , since @xmath34^t$ ] , @xmath32 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "we emphasise that the adjacency matrix of two coupled networks ( see  @xcite ) can be written in complete analogy to eq .",
    "( [ isrm ] ) .",
    "specifically , for an _ inter - system recurrence network ( irn ) _ constructed from two coupled complex systems , we can formally define @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37-dimensional identity matrix ( @xmath38 ) . in the resulting undirected and unweighted simple ( no self - loops , multiple edges , or edge and vertex weights ) network , the vertices represent the state vectors of both systems . due to the block structure of eq .",
    "( [ isrm ] ) , the irn consists of ( i ) two ( unipartite ) rns of the individual systems , the properties of which have been exhaustively studied elsewhere  @xcite , and ( ii ) a bipartite network that includes only edges between vertices from different systems . in analogy",
    "to crps , we call the latter bipartite graphs _",
    "cross - recurrence networks_.    in order to quantitatively study irns from a general coupled networks point of view  @xcite ( see section [ sec : measures ] ) , the two subnetworks corresponding to the individual dynamical systems need to be clearly distinguished , i.e. , there have to be only few cross - recurrences in comparison to intra - system recurrences ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "since this practical requirement is not always met by eq .",
    "( [ isrm ] ) , it is necessary to modify the framework introduced above by allowing for different threshold distances @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath30",

    "quantitatively comparable , it is recommended to choose @xmath40 and @xmath41 independently such that @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "since the irn framework is based on purely geometric considerations ,    the underlying time series do not need to have the same sampling .",
    "specifically , irns do _ not _ make use of any time information ( which is distinctively different in comparison with many other existing methods of time series analysis ) and exclusively require a reasonable attractor coverage in the ( original or reconstructed ) phase space by the sampled data .",
    "the topological properties of general coupled networks can be quantified by a number of measures which represent a generalisation of the canonical measures of complex network theory  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we briefly review those characteristics which are particularly important for characterising irns .",
    "subsequently , we discuss how these measures can indicate the direction of a coupling between certain dynamical systems . for a comprehensive study and detailed background of the underlying analytical theory",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "given a general undirected and unweighted simple graph @xmath46 described by the adjacency matrix @xmath47 , consider a partition of the vertex set @xmath48 into two disjunct subsets @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , the edge set @xmath52 is decomposed into disjunct sets @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 such that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the induced subgraphs of the vertex sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 with respect to the full graph @xmath62 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : subnetworks ] ) .",
    "then @xmath63 contains the ( internal ) edges within the subgraph or subnetwork @xmath64 ( likewise @xmath65 those of @xmath66 ) , while @xmath67 comprises edges interconnecting the subnetworks @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , we can formally define bipartite subgraphs @xmath68 containing all vertices of the vertex subsets @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the ( cross- ) edges between these two sets . in the specific case of irns ,",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath66 correspond to the intra - system rns constructed from the systems @xmath4 and @xmath16 , whereas @xmath69 contains the cross - recurrence structure in terms of the sets of cross - edges @xmath67 .",
    "in the following , the letters @xmath70 shall denote single vertices ( figs . [ fig : subnetworks ] and [ fig : interacting ] ) .    ) while dashed lines represent cross - edges ( elements of @xmath67 ) connecting vertices of both subnetworks . ]    for a given vertex @xmath71 , the _ cross - degree _ @xmath72 gives the number of edges which connect @xmath73 with any vertex in subgraph @xmath66 .",
    "taking the average over all @xmath71 and normalising yields the _ cross - edge density _",
    "@xmath74 between the subgraphs @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "for an irn , @xmath75 equals the cross - recurrence rate @xmath76 between the systems @xmath4 and @xmath16 .",
    "the _ local cross - clustering coefficient _ @xmath77 estimates the probability that two randomly drawn neighbours of vertex @xmath71 from subgraph @xmath66 are also neighbours . for vertices",
    "@xmath78 with a cross - degree of zero or one , we define @xmath79 in order to avoid divergencies . by averaging over all vertices",
    "@xmath71 , we obtain the _ global cross - clustering coefficient _",

    "@xmath82 which , as an analog to the canonical network transitivity  @xcite , counts the number of `` cross - triangles '' over the number of `` cross - triples '' .",
    "it is important to note that both the cross - transitivity and the global cross - clustering coefficient are _ not _ invariant under the permutation @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interacting ] ) , which is in fact the foundation of the method presented in the following .     and cross - transitivities @xmath86 . ]      for traditional rns , the canonical network measure of transitivity as well as the local and global versions of the clustering coefficient",
    "have already been recognised as valuable characteristics @xcite .",
    "specifically , local clustering coefficient and global network transitivity can be interpreted as measures for the effective local and global dimension of chaotic attractors , respectively  @xcite . following and expanding these ideas",
    ", we now take a look at the `` bivariate '' versions of these measures and how they behave under certain imposed constraints , in our case exemplified by a variable coupling between two dynamical systems @xmath4 and @xmath16 .    by taking into account both the univariate and the bivariate recurrence properties of the coupled system , cross - transitivity and global cross - clustering coefficient are unique in the way in which they act as a filter for information provided not by the individual systems intrinsic processes , but by the way in which they are coupled . specifically ,",
    "if the two systems are sufficiently similar with respect to their invariant density , the geometric effects of coupling can be understood as follows ( table  [ tab : coupling ] ) :    a.   in the _ uncoupled _ case , we can consider @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath81 and @xmath89 as randomly arising from the invariant densities of @xmath4 and @xmath16 without any additional structural component .",
    "therefore , we can expect @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "b.   now consider a _",
    "unidirectional _ coupling of the type @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a monotonic function of either positive or negative sign ( for example , in the important case of a diffusive coupling , @xmath94 , with @xmath95 being the coupling strength ) . the strength and directionality of this coupling can be varied .",
    "let @xmath96 and @xmath97 be two recurrent states in @xmath4 . if the coupling direction is @xmath98 and the coupling is large enough , we are likely to also find a state @xmath99 in @xmath16 , which is ( cross- ) recurrent to both @xmath96 and @xmath97 , due to the coupling s diffusive nature and thus the tendency to `` drag '' the trajectory of @xmath16 towards @xmath4 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : coupling ] ) .",
    "the resulting `` cross - triangle '' adds to the value of both @xmath88 and @xmath89 according to their definition .",
    "on the other hand , `` cross - triangles '' constituted by two recurrent states in @xmath16 and one cross - recurrent state in @xmath4 are merely coincidental due to the driver - response - like coupling .",
    "we would thus expect to see @xmath100 and @xmath101 in case of a unidirectional coupling @xmath98 and vice versa for the opposite coupling direction .",
    "+ to put it differently : from the viewpoint of the driven system @xmath16 , the driving system @xmath4 `` contracts '' more than @xmath16 from the perspective of @xmath4 . because @xmath4 is in fact unchanged ( unidirectional coupling )",
    ", this effect _ must _ be due to changes of the spatial distribution of states in @xmath16 induced by the coupling .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the generic form of the governing dynamical equations , @xmath92 , i.e. , the driven system @xmath16 tends to minimise its distance to the driver @xmath4 .",
    "c.   finally , for a _ symmetric bidirectional _ coupling , the mutual effects on both systems are comparable and thus lead to irn measures of the same magnitude .",
    "the same observation should hold if the subsystems become synchronised ( at least in a generalised sense ) , e.g. , in case of a sufficiently strong coupling .",
    "is dragged closer to @xmath4 , while @xmath4 itself remains unchanged .",
    "we thus get an additional contribution to @xmath89 and @xmath88 in form of a `` cross - triangle '' . ]",
    ".expected qualitative behaviour of irn measures in different coupling situations for systems with comparable properties in the absence of ( generalised ) synchronisation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the two datasets @xmath102 and @xmath103 we first apply detrending by subtracting a 100-yr moving - average from all data ( for a detailed description of the corresponding procedure , see @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasise that this is crucial for the interpretation of all further results of our analysis , since we restrict ourselves to variability on inter - annual to multi - decadal time scales ( i.e. , scales below 100 years ) . as a second step , we use time - delay embedding of the data with an embedding dimension of @xmath104 in both cases but different time delays of @xmath105 for the dongge record and @xmath106 for the qunf record .",
    "these parameters have been chosen according to the results of the false nearest neighbors and auto - mutual information methods @xcite .",
    "the distinct time delays account for the time series different average sampling rates , leading to @xmath107 years on average for both records to make the considered state vectors actually comparable ( cf",
    ".  tab .",
    "[ tab : data ] ) .",
    "note that for the embedding step , we neglect possible variations of the sampling rate with time , as has been done before in successful applications of univariate recurrence network analysis to palaeoclimate data @xcite .",
    "this simplification possibly leads to modified positions of individual state vectors in the reconstructed phase space .",
    "however , since the exact timing of all data points is not known and the sampling rate does not change too much with time , we argue that within the uncertainty of both the recorded observable and the timing of measurements , the approximated low - dimensional attractor has a shape that does not differ markedly from that one would reconstruct when having `` perfect '' ( equidistant and completely certain ) observations .    in the considered example",
    ", the auto - correlations of both records decay sufficiently fast ( i.e. , fall below @xmath108 within one sampling time step on average ) .",
    "this allows us excluding severe effects due to `` false '' recurrences corresponding to subsequent observations , which can occur if the sampling is very dense in comparison with the typical time - scale on which the auto - correlations decay . in such cases , however , removing the corresponding sojourn points from the recurrence matrix by introducing a suitable theiler window would provide a simple and feasible solution  @xcite .",
    "following these considerations , the requirement of a `` sufficient attractor coverage '' could be turned into more explicit conditions ( such as time series covering at least about 10 - 20 oscillations of a chaotic system , or a comparable requirement on the total number of data for general real - world time series with a typical preferred time scale ) .",
    "having thus obtained time series in a reconstructed phase space that is quantitatively comparable for both records , from the embedded state vectors we bootstrap 80% of the data and calculate the resulting irns and their cross - transitivities and global cross - clustering coefficients , with @xmath109 and @xmath110 as in section 3 .",
    "this procedure is carried out @xmath111 times to evaluate the robustness of our results .",
    "the chosen size of the bootstrap samples presents a trade - off between the requirements of a sufficiently large number of different samples and sufficiently large individual samples .",
    "we emphasise that because the irn approach does not make any assumptions on the timing of observations , we can directly apply this method , including the considered bootstrapping approach , to the embedded time series disregarding their irregular sampling and imperfect chronological control .",
    "in fact , this is an important advantage of our network - based approach in comparison with rqa and similar techniques , which rely on line structures in a recurrence plot and , hence , uniform sampling .    as a result",
    ", we find that the bootstrapped distributions of the traditional rn transitivities and global clustering coefficients of the two respective records display a considerable overlap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data1 ] ) .",
    "this observation indicates that the two climate subsystems ( the dynamics of which have been recorded by the considered palaeoclimate archives ) are sufficiently similar with respect to their long - term dynamics so that both can actually be viewed as sharing the same phase space .",
    "the latter finding motivates the further consideration of our irn approach for detecting a possible directional coupling between both systems .",
    "in fact , the resulting distributions of cross - transitivities and global cross - clustering coefficients are clearly separated by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this general observation persists when interpolating both records to a common and uniform sampling before constructing the irn ( not shown ) , underlining the feasibility and robustness of the considered approach .",
    "this suggests that the coupling direction was @xmath114 during the holocene .",
    "specifically , under the assumptions that ( i ) @xmath103 represents the ism activity and @xmath102 the easm dynamics , ( ii ) auto - correlations do not play a significant role on the considered time - scales , and ( iii ) a possible coupling between both climate subsystems is of diffusive nature , we can thus argue that the monsoon impact at the location of the chinese cave was probably not only controlled by the easm but also by the ism , whereas the easm did not have a comparably strong impact on the location of the oman cave .",
    "independent realisations .",
    "the distributions of the inter - system measures are clearly separated with @xmath115 , indicating a possible coupling direction @xmath114 . ]    a possible directed influence of one monsoon branch to locations usually influenced by the other monsoon branch is of considerable importance for understanding the dynamical mechanisms of the monsoonal system ( e.g. , as proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "the potential directionality of ism towards the easm region indicated by our results suggests that the ism branch is probably stronger , at least on average during the considered period of time .",
    "this could also imply that the indian ocean ( in particular the indian ocean sea surface temperature , the principal pattern of which is the indian ocean dipole , iod @xcite ) plays not only an important regional role for the indian subcontinent , but also for the entire asian monsoon system .",
    "the easm is strongly influenced by the el nio / southern oscillation ( enso ) , whereas the enso impact on the monsoon rainfall in india is known to be more subtle and changing over time  @xcite .",
    "the detected directionality adds a new aspect to this relationship and might help in further improving our understanding of the asian monsoon system as a whole .",
    "we particularly emphasise that irns can provide important information for constructing and interpreting networks of palaeoclimate records  @xcite to infer dominating spatial patterns of climate dynamics in the earth s history .",
    "we have proposed a new complex network - based approach for inferring coupling directions from bivariate time series .",
    "the recently introduced concepts of recurrence networks @xcite and coupled network analysis @xcite have been combined to the new analytical tool of inter - system recurrence networks ( irns ) .",
    "cross - transitivity and global cross - clustering coefficient of irns can be used to quantitatively derive the coupling direction based on purely geometric considerations .",
    "although developing a corresponding generally applicable theoretical understanding , as well as a systematic comparison with other existing techniques for detecting the coupling direction between two measured signals , will be subject of future research , our results suggest that the proposed framework can be applied to many situations where the exact functional form of coupling is not necessarily known .",
    "we have demonstrated the potential of the proposed framework using a prototypical model system and discussed its robustness and sensitivity with respect to data length and recurrence threshold .",
    "we find that the irn method performs well even for short time series ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "another important advantage of our approach is that it relies on the spatial structure of the coupled attractors in phase space and does not require any time - information .",
    "hence , problems of strong auto - correlations often present in real - world systems are avoided by construction . in turn , our method is not able to detect possible coupling delays unless being applied separately for different , mutually shifted time slices .",
    "the proposed approach can be directly generalised to studying mutual couplings among a set of @xmath0 subsystems , which leads to irns the adjacency matrices of which have a block structure composed of @xmath117 traditional ( unipartite ) recurrence networks and @xmath118 bipartite cross - recurrence networks .",
    "note , however , that the study of couplings for @xmath0 is much more challenging than for @xmath119 , since in this case both direct and indirect interactions may be present and need to be distinguished .",
    "it will be subject of future research to investigate if and how the proposed geometric framework based on multivariate extensions of recurrence networks is able to cope with this problem .    as a real - world example",
    ", we have studied the possible directionality of coupling between the indian summer monsoon ( ism ) and the east asian summer monsoon ( easm ) during the last about 10,000 years .",
    "our method allows its direct application to the data without interpolation to a common time axis . from our analysis",
    "we find indications that the ism is probably influencing the monsoon strength in eastern china ( located in the easm influence region ) on multi - decadal time scales between about 10 years ( data resolution ) and 100 years ( scale of detrending ) , which supports previous findings based on modelling @xcite .",
    "however , further research is necessary to unambiguously verify this result by means of complementary methods of bivariate time series analysis .    as a final remark , it is worth mentioning that there are other , conceptually different multivariate generalisations of recurrence plots , such as joint recurrence plots  @xcite and multivariate recurrence and cross - recurrence plots  @xcite . in principle",
    ", all these concepts could be re - interpreted from a complex network point of view as well .",
    "however , due to their different construction mechanisms , they provide different types of information on the investigated systems in comparison with the approach presented in this work .",
    "a detailed corresponding study will be subject of future work .",
