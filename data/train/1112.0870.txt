    "turing instability is one of the reference mechanisms for pattern formation in nature @xcite .",
    "the turing idea applies to a large gallery of phenomena that can be modelled via reaction - diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "these latter are mathematical models that describe the dynamical evolution of distinct families of constituents , mutually coupled and freely diffusing in the embedding medium .",
    "diffusion can seed the instability by perturbing the mean  field homogeneous state , through an activator  inhibitor mechanism , and so yielding the emergence of patched , non homogeneous in space , density distributions .",
    "the most intriguing applications of the turing paradigm are encountered in the context of morphogenesis , the branch of embryology which studies the development of patterns and forms in biology .",
    "the realm of application of the turing ideas encompasses however different fields , ranging from chemistry @xcite to biology @xcite , passing through physics @xcite , where large communities of homologous elements evolve and interact .    according to the classical viewpoint",
    ", however , the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor species has to be larger than that of the activator , for the patterns to eventually develop .",
    "this is a strict mathematical constraint which is not always met in e.g. contexts of biological relevance @xcite , and which limits the possibility of establishing a quantitative match between theory and empirical data .",
    "spatially extended systems made of interacting species sharing similar diffusivities can indeed display self - organized patched patterns , an observation that still calls for a sound interpretative scenario , beyond the classical turing mechanisms @xcite .",
    "one viable strategy to possibly reconcile theory and observations has been explored in @xcite and @xcite . in these studies",
    ", the authors considered the spontaneous emergence of persistent spatial patterns as mediated by the demographic endogenous noise , stemming from the intimate discreteness of the scrutinized system .",
    "the intrinsic noise translates into a systematic enlargement of the parameter region yielding the turing order , when compared to the corresponding domain predicted within the deterministic linear stability analysis .",
    "it is however unclear at present whether experimentally recorded patterns bear the imprint of the stochasticity , a possibility that deserves to be further challenged in the future .    alternatively , and to bridge the gap with the experiments , the turing instability concept has been applied to generalized reaction",
    " diffusion equations . these latter account for cross diffusion terms which are hypothesized to exist on purely heuristic grounds or by invoking the phenomenological theory of linear non  equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "diagonal and off  diagonal coefficients of the diffusion matrix are not linked to any microscopic representation of the examined dynamics and are hence treated as free parameters of the model . in @xcite",
    "the authors quantify the impact of cross terms on the turing bifurcation , showing e.g that spatial order can materialize also if the inhibitor s diffusion ability is less pronounced than the activator s one .",
    "starting from this setting , the aims of this paper are twofold . on the one side , we shall elaborate on a microscopic theory of multispecies diffusion , fully justified from first principles .",
    "the theory here derived is specifically targeted to the two species case study and extends beyond the formulation of @xcite . on the other side , and with reference to the brusselator model",
    ", we will show that turing patterns can take place for any ratio of the main diffusivities . in doing",
    "so we will cast the conclusions of @xcite into a descriptive framework of broad applied and fundamental interest , where the key cross diffusion ingredients are not simply guessed a priori but rigorously obtained via a self  consistent derivation anchored to the microscopic world . working in the context of a reference case study , the brusselator model",
    ", we shall also perform numerical simulations based on both the underlying stochastic picture and the idealized mean  field formulation to elaborate on the robustness of the observed patterns .    in the following",
    "we briefly discuss the derivation of the model , focusing on the specific case where two species are supposed to diffuse , sharing the same spatial reservoir .",
    "consider a generic microscopic system bound to occupy a given volume of a @xmath0dimensional space .",
    "assume the volume to be partitioned into a large number @xmath1 of small hypercubic patches , each of linear size @xmath2 .",
    "each mesoscopic cell , labelled by @xmath3 , is characterized by a finite carrying capacity : it can host up to @xmath4 particles , namely @xmath5 of type @xmath6 , @xmath7 of type @xmath8 , and @xmath9 vacancies , hereafter denoted by @xmath10 . in general",
    ", the species will also interact , as dictated by specific reaction terms .",
    "let us start by solely focusing on the diffusion part , silencing any direct interaction among elementary constituents .",
    "as we shall remark , there exists an indirect degree of coupling that results from the competition for the available spatial resources . in practice",
    ", the mobility of the particles is balked if the neighbouring patches have no vacancies .",
    "particles may jump into a nearest  neighbour patch , only if there is a vacancy to be eventually filled .",
    "this mechanism translates into the following chemical equation @xmath11 where @xmath3 and @xmath12 label nearest  neighbour patches . here ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 identify the particles that belong to cell @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath15 labels instead the empties that are hosted in patch @xmath3 . the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for the associated reaction rates .",
    "similar reactions control the migration from cell @xmath12 towards cell @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , and extending beyond the scheme proposed in @xcite , we imagine the following reactions to hold : @xmath18 which in practice account for the possibility that elements @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) swap their actual positions .",
    "the state of the system is then specified by the number of @xmath6 and @xmath8 particles in each patch , the number of vacancies following from a straightforward normalization condition .",
    "introduce the vector @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 represents the rate of transition from state @xmath25 , to another state @xmath26 , compatible with the former .",

    "moreover , chemical equations ( [ mig1 ] ) result in the following transition rates : @xmath30    the process here imagined is markov , and the probability @xmath31 to observe the system in state @xmath25 at time @xmath32 is ruled by the master equation @xmath33 , \\label{master}\\ ] ] where the allowed transitions depend on the state of the system via the above relations .",
    "starting from this microscopic , hence inherently stochastic picture , one can derive a self  consistent deterministic formulation , which exactly holds in the continuum limit .",
    "mathematically , one needs to obtain the dynamical equations that govern the time evolution of the ensemble averages @xmath34 and @xmath35 . to this end , multiply first the master eq .",

    "replace then the averages of products by the products of averages , an operation that proves exact in the continuum limit @xmath41 . by introducing the continuum concentration @xmath42",
    ", rescaling time by a factor of @xmath43 and taking the size of the patches to zero one finally gets , which then turns into the continuum operator @xmath44 when sending to zero the size of the patch and scaling the rates @xmath45 and @xmath46 appropriately . ]",

    "we emphasize again that the crossed , nonlinear contributions @xmath57 stem directly from the imposed finite carrying capacity and , as such , have a specific , fully justified , microscopic origin .",
    "the diffusive fluxes that drive the changes in the concentrations @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be written as : @xmath58    it is interesting to notice that relations ( [ modified_ficks ] ) enable us to make contact with the field of linear non  equilibrium thermodynamics ( lnet ) , a branch of statistical physics which defines the general framework for the macroscopic description of e.g. transport processes .",

    "that rule the diffusion of the two species @xmath51 and @xmath52 are linearly related to the forces , the gradients of the respective concentrations .",

    "having derived a plausible macroscopic description for the two components diffusion process , we can now move on by allowing the involved species to interact and consequently consider in the mathematical model the corresponding reaction terms . as an important remark",
    ", we notice that these latter can be also obtained as follows the above , rather general , approach that bridges micro and macro realms .",
    "first , one need to resolve the interactions among individual constituents , by translating into chemical equations the microscopic processes implicated .",

    "as we have anticipated , the interest of this generalized formulation , resides in that it allows for turing like patterns in a region of the parameter space that is instead forbidden when conventional reaction ",
    "diffusion systems are considered .",
    "the novelty of the proposed formulation has to do with the presence of specific cross diffusion terms , which follow a sound physical request , and add to the classical laplacians , signature of fickean diffusion .",
    "let @xmath74 be the steady state solution of the homogeneous ( aspatial ) system , namely @xmath75 .",
    "the fixed point is linearly stable if the jacobian matrix @xmath76 @xmath77 has positive determinant and negative trace .",

    "in particular , if one of the eigenvalues admits a positive real part for some values of @xmath83 , then a spatially modulated instability develops .",
    "the growth of the perturbation as seeded by the linear instability will saturate due to the non linearities and eventually results in a characteristic pattern associated to the unstable mode @xmath83 .",
    "steady patterns of the turing type require in addition that the imaginary part of the eigenvalues associated to the unstable mode are zero .",
    "in formulae , the turing instability sets in if there exists a @xmath83 such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these latter conditions are to be imposed , jointly with the request of a stable homogeneous fixed point ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) , to identify the parameters values that drive the instability .",
    "alternatively , one can obtain a set of explicit conditions following the procedure outlined below , and adapted from @xcite .",

    "these observations are general and similar conclusions can be drawn assuming other reactions schemes of the inhibitor / activator type , different from the brusselator model .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "summing up , turing patterns can develop for virtually _ any _ ratio of the main diffusivities in a multispecies setting .",
    "this striking effect originates from the generalized diffusion theory that is here assumed to hold and that builds on the scheme discussed in @xcite . because of the competition for the available resources , a modified ( deterministic ) diffusive behaviour",
    "is recovered : cross diffusive terms appear which links multiple diffusing communities and which add to the standard laplacian terms , relic of fick s law . the fact that turing like patterns are possible for e.g. equal diffusivities of the species involved . ] , as follows a sound dynamical mechanism , constitutes an intriguing observation that hold promise to eventually reconcile theory and experimental evidences .",
    "the investigated setting applies in particular to multispecies systems that evolve in a crowded environment , as it happens for instance inside the cells where different families of proteins and other biomolecular actors are populating a densely packed medium .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the stochastic fluctuations , endogenous to the scrutinized system in its discrete version , eventually destroy the patterns , that are instead deemed to be stable according to the idealized deterministic viewpoint .",
