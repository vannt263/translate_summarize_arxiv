    "the physical mechanism to transport angular momentum in accretion disks is an important unsettled issue in astrophysics .",
    "it has been extensively studied for decades using theoretical and numerical procedures .",
    "the main purpose of these studies is to find the efficient transport process of the angular momentum to account for the powerful mass accretion deeply associated with the release of the gravitational energy observed in astrophysical disk systems @xcite .",
    "propose a pioneering disk model for describing the steady mass accretion , in which the efficiency of the angular momentum transport is parametrized and represented by a dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11-component of the stress tensor , and @xmath12 is the total pressure .",
    "the phenomenological parameter @xmath0 introduced in the disk model should be determined experimentally .",
    "this disk model is widely accepted today as the standard , and referred to as `` standard shakura - sunyaev model '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , we simply call it the @xmath0-model ) .",
    "it is pointed out by @xcite from the observational point of view that the viscosity parameter @xmath0 should be at the level @xmath13 in order to explain the powerful outbursts from disk systems , such as dwarf novae , x - ray transients , and a fully ionized part of the disk in active galactic nucleus ( agns ) .",
    "since the required level for the viscosity parameter @xmath0 is much larger than that resulting from the microscopic molecular viscosity , the turbulent viscosity becomes the most promising candidate for governing the angular momentum transport in astrophysical disk systems .",
    "the keplerian disks are known to be linearly stable to the shear instability ( rayleigh instability ) which could power the hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "even when the non - linear perturbations are imposed , the keplerian disks can never reach the highly turbulent state in the rayleigh stable condition @xcite .",
    "numerical studies in addition show that the other hydrodynamic instabilities , such as convective and papaloizou - pringle instabilities , do not play a central role in inducing the efficient angular momentum transport in the disk systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite focus , for the first time , on the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) which is originally found by @xcite and @xcite as a candidate for operating the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the disk systems .",
    "it has essentially a local nature and destabilizes weakly magnetized differentially rotating systems with a negative shear rate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angular velocity and @xmath16 is the cylindrical radius .",
    "the non - linear mhd turbulence driven by the mri has been broadly investigated as the leading mechanism for the turbulent angular momentum transport in disk systems using state - of - the - art numerical techniques and huge computer facilities for the mhd simulations .",
    "the physical properties of the mri - driven turbulence , however , have not yet been confirmed completely even today .",
    "a recent remarkable finding in the mri studies is the dependence of the transport efficiency of the mri - driven turbulence on the magnetic prandtl number @xmath8 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the viscosity and @xmath3 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the local shearing box simulations explicitly taking into account the microscopic kinematic viscosity and resistivity suggest that the total turbulent stress ( sum of maxwell and reynolds stresses ) depends on the magnetic prandtl number . especially in the system with the non - zero net magnetic flux , the turbulent stress and the viscosity parameter @xmath0 resulting from the mri - driven turbulence would increase with the magnetic prandtl number , that is @xmath17 , where @xmath5 is the power - law index with positive value .",
    "it should be stressed that the viscous effect on the non - linear mri - turbulence is seemingly contradictory to that on the linear growth of the mri @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the viscosity can boost the transport efficiency of the mri - driven turbulence although it suppresses the growth of the mri in its linear evolutionary regime .",
    "the physical mechanism for the viscous boosting of the mri - driven turbulence is a central issue in the current mri studies and remains to be solved to draw a complete physical picture of the angular momentum transport in the accretion disks @xcite .",
    "the impact of the microscopic diffusivities on the mri - driven turbulence should be essential not only in understanding the nature of the mri itself , but also in applying it to the realistic astrophysical disk systems .",
    "assuming the standard @xmath0-disk , the size of the magnetic prandtl number drastically changes depending on the disk radius .",
    "@xcite suggest that the magnetic prandtl number @xmath8 is typically larger in the inner disk when we adopt spitzer s values for evaluating the microscopic diffusivities @xcite .",
    "hence , the transport efficiency of the angular momentum should be affected by the magnetic prandtl number and become a function of the disk radius when the viscosity parameter follows the relation @xmath17 which is implied from the recent local shearing box simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a steady model for geometrically thin disk taking account of the `` non - standard '' description of the viscosity parameter which depends on the magnetic prandtl number in the form @xmath18 .",
    "this should be consistent treatment of the turbulent viscosity with the results from recent local shearing box simulations @xcite .",
    "a central difference between the work done by @xcite and ours is to include the structural change of the disk depending on the size of the magnetic prandtl number @xmath8 in our model consistently .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the steady disk model with the non - standard description of the viscosity parameter @xmath17 is constructed in   2 .",
    "we then describe the basic properties of our disk model . in   3 , we investigate the stability of our steady disk model to the gravitational , thermal , and secular instabilities .",
    "the dependence of the stability criteria on the magnetic prandtl number ( or index @xmath5 ) is our interest in this section .",
    "finally , we discuss the application of our model to the realistic astrophysical disk system and summarize our findings in   4 .",
    "we construct a steady disk model consistently combining the properties of the mri - driven turbulence recently found by numerical studies @xcite . the fundamental assumption adopted in this work",
    "is that the viscosity parameter @xmath19 depends on the disk radius and reflects the transport properties of the mri - driven turbulence .",
    "also we assumed that the disk heating is local in which the variation of the thermal energy responds to the turbulent energy dissipation instantaneously @xcite .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the recent numerical work of the mri - driven turbulence @xcite .    according to the recent numerical studies , the efficiency of the angular momentum transport sustained by the mri - driven turbulence is regulated by the magnetic prandtl number which characterizes the system . using the viscosity parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "the transport efficiency of the mri - driven turbulence can be represented by , as is described in   1 , @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 is the normalization parameter which controls the size of @xmath19 to be smaller than unity .",
    "note that this relation reduces to the classical standard @xmath0-model by taking @xmath22 . for providing the magnetic prandtl number",
    ", we adopt the spitzers values for the microscopic kinematic viscosity @xmath2 and the electron resistivity @xmath3 by assuming the fully ionized gas .",

    "this suggests that the positive temperature perturbation enhances the viscous heating rate and thus the positive feedback to the thermal instability . on the other hand , the transport efficiency of the angular momentum decreases with increasing the gas density when @xmath6",
    "this works in the same way as the negative diffusion and also enhances the positive feedback to the secular instability .",
    "it is the most remarkable feature of our disk model that the thermal and secular instabilities can grow in its middle part even if the radiation pressure is negligibly small in the condition @xmath7 .",
    "also the outer part of the disk can be unstable to thermal and secular instabilities when @xmath139 ( radiation pressure dominant with shakura - sunyaev type stress tensor , @xmath127 ) or @xmath134 ( gas pressure dominant ) .",
    "if the mri plays an important role in operating the mhd - turbulence and the viscosity parameter @xmath0 depends on the magnetic prandtl number , the steady mass accretion would not be maintained due to the growth of these instabilities in the geometrically thin disk .",
    "the rapid transition from the steady accretion phase to the non - steady state should be considered to enable us to understand more deeply the origin of the light curve observed from the realistic astrophysical disk system .    in our model",
    ", we assumed that the turbulent stress tensor is just proportional to the pressure according to the standard @xmath0-disk model ( see , equation [ eq : galphapre ] ) . on the other hand , recent local shearing box simulations for",
    "the mri imply that the pressure dependence of the turbulent viscosity might be weak compared to that assumed in the standard @xmath0-disk model , that is @xmath140 where the index @xmath141 takes a value in the range @xmath142 @xcite .    when the pressure dependence of the turbulent viscosity is weaker than that assumed in the standard @xmath0-disk , the viscous heating rate is expected to become insensitive to the temperature perturbation .",
    "the disk thus becomes more stable to the thermal instability .",
    "additionally , the secular instability should also be suppressed because the turbulent stress would then respond weakly to the density perturbation .",
    "now let us derive the stability condition of disks when the turbulent stress varies weakly depending on the pressure as is implied from the recent numerical studies . using the prescription @xmath143 [ note that this equation reduces equation ( [ eq : galphapre ] ) when @xmath144 and assuming the electron scattering as the dominant opacity source , the instability conditions are given by ( [ ap : midth ] ) for the thermal instability , and ( [ ap : midsc ] ) for the secular instability ( see appendix for the details of derivation ) .",
    "conditions ( [ ap : midth ] ) and ( [ ap : midsc ] ) can commonly yield , by taking @xmath145 ( gas pressure dominant ) , @xmath146 here we assume @xmath117 .",
    "this equation indicates that the weak dependence of the viscosity parameter on the pressure ( i.e. , @xmath147 ) has a stabilization effect on the thermal and secular instabilities .    for the model in which the free - free absorption is the main opacity source ,",
    "the stability conditions for the thermal and secular instabilities can be obtained from ( [ ap : outth ] ) and ( [ ap : outsc ] ) , respectively . by taking @xmath145 ,",
    "these conditions are combined to a single condition @xmath148 here we assume @xmath117 .",
    "this also shows that the instabilities can be suppressed when the pressure dependence of the viscosity parameter is weaker than that assumed in the standard disk models",
    ".    it should be important to stress that even when the turbulent stress does not directly depend on the pressure ( i.e. , @xmath149 ) , the disk can be unstable since the efficiency of the angular momentum transport @xmath0 depends on the temperature and the density .",
    "in such case , the instabilities grow when @xmath150 for the middle part of the disks and when @xmath151 for the outer part of the disks .",
    "since @xmath5 is predicted to be less than unity from the recent local simulations , the middle part of the disks can be unstable to these instabilities when the saturation levels of mri - driven turbulence is strongly controlled by the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "finally we discuss the validity of the assumption adopted in our disk model .",
    "numerical studies for the mri imply that transport properties of the mri - driven turbulence depend on the magnetic prandtl number as is given in equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "this relation is verified only in the narrow parameter range @xmath152 and @xmath153 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath154 is the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "the range of @xmath8 examined in numerical studies corresponds to the region @xmath155 in our model .",
    "the @xmath8-dependence of the viscosity parameter @xmath19 is not well studied due to the computational issue in the parameter range characterizing the outer part of the disk model .",
    "in addition , reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers are taken to be involuntarily larger values than the realistic values for the astrophysical ionized gas due to the limitation of the computational resources .",
    "if we suppose the realistic values of viscosity and resistivity , their related dissipation scales become much smaller than those resolved in existing state - of - the - art numerical simulations . in order to facilitate the understanding of astrophysical accretion processes , we need to examine whether such small scale dissipation processes actually affect the dynamics of the accretion disks via the angular momentum transport and then the instabilities of the disk .",
    "additionally , it has not been confirmed whether the viscosity parameter is impacted by the magnetic prandtl number when the microscopic diffusivities are the functions of the physical parameters such as the density and the temperature because the uniform diffusivities are assumed in the existing local shearing box simulations .",
    "we need further systematic studies on the non - linear properties of the mri in the vertically stratified disks with variable diffusive parameters and the realistic radiative cooling in order to verify the @xmath8-dependence of the turbulent viscosity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "our model does not include just for simplicity the effect of magnetic fields explicitly ( but takes account of the effect of the mhd turbulence through the non - standard @xmath0-prescription ) .",
    "the impacts of the magnetic field can modify the disk structure .",
    "since the magnetic pressure contributes to the total pressure appeared in equation ( [ eq : galphapre ] ) and weakens the temperature dependence of the viscous heating , it might suppress the growth of gravitational , thermal and secular instabilities when the magnetic pressure dominates the gas and radiation pressures .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper but would be studied as our future work using numerical procedures .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for improving our manuscript .",
    "we also thank hiroshi oda , ken ohsuga and ryoji matsumoto for fruitful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly summarize the derivation of the stability conditions shown by equations ( [ tins : mid ] ) , ( [ tins : out ] ) , ( [ sol : pthmid ] ) , and ( [ sol : pthout ] ) . here",
    "we use a following general prescription for the stress tensor , instead of the form introduced by equation ( [ eq : galphapre ] ) , @xmath156 where @xmath141 is a constant .",
    "when @xmath157 , this equation reduces to equation ( [ eq : galphapre ] ) .",
    "we hereafter describe the unperturbed and perturbed quantities by subscripts 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "note that all the physical unperturbed quantities are assumed to be much larger than their associated perturbed quantities in the following .",
    "we consider the stability criterion of the system to the thermal instability . as is discussed in ",
    "[ tsins ] , we can assume that the dynamical equilibrium is maintained during the growth of the thermal instability since the dynamical time scale is much shorter than the thermal one .",
    "also we can assume that the material motion resulting from a temperature variation occurs only in vertical direction since the force balances with the gravitational force in the radial direction .",
    "then the surface density @xmath158 is approximately unchanged during the growth of the thermal instability ; @xmath159 while the hydrostatic balance is maintained @xcite .    the linearized form of equation ( [ eq : hydro ] ) and the total pressure @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the radiation pressure , are @xmath162 @xmath163 note that equations ( [ eq : eos ] ) and ( [ eq : beta ] ) are adopted for the derivation .",
    "when the electron scattering is the dominant source of the opacity , the radiative cooling ( [ eq : qrad ] ) provides a linearized equation @xmath165 by substituting equations ( [ ap : th3 ] ) and ( [ ap : th4 ] ) into equation ( [ crit : thermal ] ) and using equation ( [ ap : sconst ] ) , we obtain the instability condition @xmath166 when we take @xmath167 , this equation reduces to equation ( [ tins : mid ] ) since @xmath168 .",
    "when the free - free absorption mainly determines the opacity of the system , we can give a linearized equation for the radiative cooling , by using equations ( [ eq : opacity ] ) and ( [ ap : th1 ] ) , @xmath169 by substituting equations ( [ ap : th3 ] ) and ( [ ap : th6 ] ) into equation ( [ crit : thermal ] ) and applying equation ( [ ap : sconst ] ) , we obtain the instability criterion for the thermal instability , @xmath170 note that this can reduce to the condition ( [ tins : out ] ) when @xmath171 since @xmath168 .",
    "finally we consider the stability condition of the system against the secular instability .",
    "when the secular instability grows , the negative diffusion amplifies the surface density so that the assumption ( [ ap : sconst ] ) can not be adopted here . as mentioned in ",
    "[ tsins ] , the viscous time scale , which is equivalent with the typical growth time of the secular instability , is much longer than the thermal time scale . the thermal equilibrium is thus maintained during the development of the secular instabilities , i.e. , @xmath172",
    "this can provide a linearized equation @xmath173 for the case with the electron scattering as the main opacity source , and @xmath174 for the model with the free - free absorption as the dominant opacity source .    by combining equations ( [ ap : th1 ] ) , ( [ ap : th2 ] ) and ( [ ap : th7 ] ) or ( [ ap : th8 ] ) , we can express the quantities @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 by @xmath178 for each model with different opacity source .",
    "then by substituting these obtained equations into equation ( [ crit : secular ] ) , we obtain the instability criterion for the secular instability .",
    "when the electron scattering is the main opacity source , the instability condition is given as @xmath179 this condition is identical with equation ( [ ap : midth ] ) when @xmath180 since the numerator in equation ( [ ap : midsc ] ) has a positive value .",
    "especially when @xmath171 , this equation reduces to equation ( [ tins : mid ] ) .    the disks in which the free - free absorption becomes the dominant opacity source is unstable to the secular instability when @xmath181 since the numerator of equation ( [ ap : outsc ] ) is positive when @xmath180 , the condition for the secular instability in the outer region is identical with that for the thermal instability given in equation ( [ ap : outth ] ) .",
    "when @xmath157 , this equation reduces to equation ( [ tins : out ] ) ."
