    "let us now introduce the following condition , which will be crucial in our following results , and which is closely related to the particular form for the coupling term given in assumption [ mainass2 ] ( removing this assumption would make condition [ cond : modul ] impossible to write down explicitly ) .",

    "more precisely , consider the system @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the initial data and @xmath61 is the control .",

    "assume that there exists an open set @xmath49 such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 then we can adapt the proof of theorem [ theo : positif ] to prove that system is null controllable on the time interval @xmath28 under suitable regularity conditions on the coefficients .",
    "condition [ cond : modul ] is clearly technical since it does not even cover the case of constant coefficients proved in @xcite , the general case given in @xcite ( under some assumption on the control domain ) or the one - dimensional result given in @xcite .",
    "however , theorem [ theo : negatif ] implies that one can not expect the null controllability to be true in general without extra assumptions on the coefficients .",

    ". the authors want to highlight that the coupling operator is constant in the whole domain and nevertheless the system can be controllable or not following the localisation of the control domain , which is an unexpected phenomenon",
    ".      many models of interest involve ( linear or non - linear ) coupled equations of parabolic systems , notably in fluid mechanics , medicine , chemistry , ecology , geology , etc . , and this explains why during the past years , the study of the controllability properties of linear or nonlinear parabolic systems has been an increasing subject of interest ( see for example the survey @xcite ) .",
    "the main issue is what is called the _ indirect _ controllability , that is to say one wants to control many equations with less controls than equations , by acting indirectly on the equations where no control term appears thanks to the coupling terms appearing in the system .",
    "this notion is fondamental for real - life applications , since in some complex systems only some quantities can be effectively controlled . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the previous results concerning the null or approximate controllability of linear parabolic systems with distributed controls , but there are also many other results concerning boundary controls or other classes of systems like hyperbolic systems .",
    "first of all , in the case of zero order coupling terms , the case of constant coefficients is now completely treated and we refer to @xcite and @xcite for parabolic systems having constant coupling coefficients ( with diffusion coefficients that may depend on the space variable though ) and for some results in the case of time - dependent coefficients . in the case of zero and one order coupling terms and constant coefficients , a necessary and sufficient condition in the case of @xmath56 equations and @xmath57 controls for constant coefficients",
    "is provided in @xcite by the authors .",
    "the case of space - varying coefficients remains still widely open despite many new partial results these last years . in the case where the support of the coupling terms intersects the control domain ,",
    "a general result is proved in @xcite for parabolic systems in cascade form with one control force ( and possibly one order coupling terms ) .",
    "we also mention @xcite , where a result of null controllability is proved in the case of a system of two equations with one control force , with an application to the controllability of a nonlinear system of transport - diffusion equations .",
    "in the situation where the coupling regions do not intersect the control domain , the situation is still not very well - understood and we have partial results , in general under technical and geometrical restrictions , notably on the control domain ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention that in this case , there might appear a minimal time for the null controllability of system ( see @xcite ) , which is a very surprising phenomenon for parabolic equations , because of the infinite speed of propagation of the information .",
    "concerning the case of first order coupling terms , we mention @xcite which gives some controllability results when the coefficient @xmath81 is equal to zero on the control domain .",
    "let us also mention the recent work @xcite , which concerns the small systems in small dimension , that is to say @xmath82 and @xmath83 systems .",
    "the authors of @xcite suppose that the control domain contains a part of the boundary @xmath84 .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the first author studied a particular cascade system with space dependent coefficients and in dimension one thanks to the moment method , and obtained necessary and sufficient conditions on the coupling terms of order @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the null controllability . to conclude ,",
    "let us also mention another result given in @xcite by the authors , which provides a sufficient condition for null controllability in dimension one for space and time - varying coefficients under some technical conditions on the coefficients , which turns out to be exactly equivalent to condition [ cond : modul ] under assumption [ mainass2 ] ( but with more regularity than in assumption [ mainass ] ) .",
    "hence , theorem [ theo : positif ] can be seen as a generalization in the multi - dimensional case of the one - dimensional result given in @xcite . for a more detailed state of the art concerning this problem",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "hence , the present paper improves the previous results in the following sense :    * contrary to @xcite , we prove in theorem [ theo : positif ] the null controllability of system with a condition on @xmath87 but for space / time dependent coefficients , in any space dimension and without any condition on the control domain . * in the previous results , it was surprising to have some very different sufficient conditions for the null controllability of system in the case of first order coupling terms , for example on one hand constant coupling coefficients and on the other hand a region of control which intersects the boundary of the domain . through the example of a not approximately controllable system given in theorem [ theo : negatif2 ] and [ theo : negatif ] , we can now better understand why such different conditions appeared since the expected general condition for the null controllability of system with space and time - varying coefficients ( i.e. it is sufficient that the control and coupling region intersect ) may be false in general if @xmath88 .",
    "in this section , we will prove that it is possible to replace locally the coupling operator @xmath39 by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the first direction in space .",
    "this kind of simplification has already been used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.6 ) for example , and we refer to this article for a more detailed proof ( see also @xcite ) .",
