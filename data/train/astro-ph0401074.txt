    "cas a , the young remnant of a type ii supernova ( sn ) , has been suggested as an ideal observing target for dust that may have formed in the explosive ejecta ( dwek & werner 1981 ) .",
    "initial ground - based searches for dust ( wright et al . 1980 , dinerstein et al . 1982 ) yielded negative results .",
    "dust was first detected in cas  a in the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) all  sky survey ( mezger et al .",
    "1986 , dwek et al .",
    "1987 , braun 1987 , arendt 1989 , saken , fesen , & shull 1992 ) .",
    "however , due to the low spatial resolution of the _ iras _ images , its origin whether interstellar , circumstellar or supernova , could not be ascertained .",
    "higher resolution infrared images of cas a , obtained with the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ ) satellite , revealed the presence of hot dust in the fast  moving knots of the remnant , thereby unambiguously establishing its sn origin ( lagage et al .",
    "1996 , arendt , dwek , & moseley 1999 , tuffs et al .",
    "dust temperatures were typically @xmath3 100200  k , consistent with those expected for shock  heated dust .",
    "dust masses were between @xmath10  m@xmath5 , depending on the size of the observed region , significantly below the mass of condensable elements expected to be present in the ejecta of a massive progenitor star ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "supernovae are potentially the most important source of interstellar dust and they play an important role in establishing the elemental depletion pattern in the interstellar medium ( dwek & scalo 1980 , dwek 1998 , jones 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , the early rise in the uv - optical opacity of high redshift galaxies suggests copious dust production in these objects ( todini & ferrara 2001 ) .",
    "the lack of any observational evidence for the formation of massive amounts of dust in supernovae is therefore quite frustrating . in light of this , the recent detections of emission from cold dust in cas  a ( dunne et al . 2003 ) and kepler ( morgan et al . 2003 ) are very encouraging , since they may provide the first observational confirmation of the role of supernovae as prominent interstellar dust sources .",
    "their findings require therefore careful scrutiny . in our analysis",
    "we will concentrate on the cold dust detection from cas  a.    the 450 and 850 @xmath2 m scuba images of cas  a ( dunne et al .",
    "2003 ) revealed a new , cold , dust component , primarily concentrated in the southern half of the remnant , and bounded between the forward and reverse shocks , located at angular radii of , respectively , 153  and 95  ( gotthelf et al . 2001 ) . the total ir spectrum from cas  a , comprised of the _ iras _ ( 12  100 @xmath2 m ) and scuba observations , from which the synchrotron component has been subtracted , was fitted by dunne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with a hot ( 112@xmath11  k ) and a cold ( 18@xmath12  k ) dust component .",
    "the hot dust component detected by the _",
    "iras _ has a mass of @xmath0  m@xmath5 , and consists of supernova dust heated by the interaction of the ejecta with the ambient medium ( arendt , dwek , & moseley 1999 ) .",
    "the cold dust has a mass between @xmath3 2 and 12  m@xmath5 , depending on its radiative properties ( dunne et al .",
    "2003 and  2 below ) .",
    "the properties and origin of the cold dust are difficult to explain even if one adopts the lower mass estimate.the inferred dust mass is too large to be of either circumstellar or interstellar origin .",
    "such origin will suggest the presence of an associated @xmath3  200  m@xmath5 mass of hydrogen , clearly ruling out the former .",
    "an interstellar cloud of that mass interacting with the remnant will give rise to optical and ir emission lines and to dynamical effects that are unobserved .",
    "below we argue that the inferred dust mass is also too large to be of supernova origin .",
    "furthermore , the gas associated with the dust , will collisionaly heat the dust to a temperature that is significantly higher than that inferred from the scuba observations . nevertheless , ruling out an interstellar or circumstellar origin , dunne et al . (",
    "2003 ) adopted the least implausible explanation , and concluded that the dust must be of sn origin .",
    "this interpretation of the scuba observations faces several difficulties :    1 .",
    "the required dust condensation efficiency in the sn ejecta is too high even for the amorphous or clumpy dust aggregates .",
    "cas  a is believed to be the remnant of the explosion of a 10 to 30  m@xmath5 star ( fesen et al .",
    "the total mass of condensible elements ( c , mg , si , s , ca , fe , ni , and associated o ) ejected in the explosion of 10 and 30  m@xmath5 stars is about 0.3 and 2  m@xmath5 , respectively ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "so even the lowest estimate of @xmath3  2  m@xmath5 of cold dust requires a very unlikely condensation efficiency of 100% in the supernova ejecta of a 30  m@xmath5 star .",
    "the large dust mass becomes even more embarrassing if , as suggested by the distribution of elemental abundance ratios in the ejecta , the progenitor of cas  a was only a 12  m@xmath5 star ( willingale et al .",
    "even allowing for a massive progenitor , the required condensation efficiency is too high considering the fact that important refractory elements ( si , ca , and fe ) are observed to be in the gas phase of the remnant , and to be more uniformly distributed than required by the dunne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) interpretation of the scuba data ( hwang , holt , & petre 2000 ; hughes et al . 2000 , willingale et al .",
    "finally , the total mass of dust that must have formed in the ejecta may actually be greater than implied from the scuba observations , since a fraction of it may have been destroyed by thermal sputtering",
    "the density of the gas associated with the cold dust is too high to account for the low dust temperature .",
    "associated with the refractory elements produced in a 30  m@xmath5 star are about 4  m@xmath5 of other abundant metals , primarily oxygen , that are not locked up in dust .",
    "we can derive a lower limit to the electron density of the emitting region by assuming that it is smoothly distributed between the forward and reverse shocks , and that it covers about 15% of the sky as seen from the center of the explosion .",
    "the volume of the region , for an adopted distance of 3.4  kpc , is then @xmath13 @xmath14 , giving a minimum electron density of @xmath3  3  @xmath14 .",
    "actual electron densities are significantly higher , since oxygen is expected to be multiply ionized in the emitting region .",
    "however , even at the low density of 3  @xmath14 , typical 0.01 @xmath2m - sized supernova condensates will be collisionally heated to temperatures of about 50  k ( dwek 1987 ) .",
    "put differently , a density of 3  @xmath14 is about 100 times higher than that required to heat the dust particles to the observed temperature of 18  k. to achieve this cold dust temperatures at these high electron densities , the radii of the dust particles in the ejecta must be @xmath15 m .",
    "however , such radii are much larger than those predicted from nucleation calculations ( kozasa , hasegawa , & nomoto 1991 ) .",
    "3 .   finally ,",
    "the 170 @xmath2 m _ iso _ observations of cas  a are actually a detection , implying an even larger amount of colder dust . in their analysis , dunne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) regarded the _ iso _ 170  @xmath2 m observations of cas  a ( tuffs et al .",
    "1999 ) as a lower limit , predicting a significantly higher flux from the remnant than observed at that wavelength . however , it was pointed out by the referee that it is difficult to explain how the isophot instrument on board the _ iso _ could have missed most of the emission from that region of the remnant .",
    "in fact , the observed 170  @xmath2 m emission is an actual detection ( private communications between the referee and r. j. tuffs made available to the author ) , and the 170  @xmath2 m flux can be entirely attributed to the hot dust emission .",
    "if the 170 @xmath2 m flux produced by the cold dust is constrained to be less than 10  jy , then the scuba data can only be fitted with @xmath3 7 to 9  k dust assuming a @xmath16 emissivity law .",
    "the mass of cold dust is then increased to @xmath3 24 to 16  m@xmath5 , respectively , even if it has the high submillimeter radiative efficiency of amorphous or clumpy aggregate material .",
    "so regarding the 170 @xmath2 m flux as an upper limit on",
    "the emission from the cold dust component simply exacerbates the difficulties listed above .",
    "the problems listed above can be alleviated if the dust responsible for the observed emission consists of conducting needles or whiskers .",
    "the high conductivity ( low resistivity ) of these needles gives rise to a mass absorption efficiency that is several orders of magnitudes greater than that of interstellar graphite or silicates , and even the amorphous clumpy aggregates considered by dunne et al .",
    "sufficiently large needles are efficient antenna  like radiators out to millimeter wavelength , depending on their length  to  diameter ratio .",
    "their large radiative efficiency significantly lowers the mass of cold dust required to explain the scuba observations .",
    "it also increases the density of electrons needed to collisionally heat the dust to the observed temperature . the introduction of such efficient radiators as the source of the observed submillimeter dust emission requires therefore a balance between the need to reduce the mass of the emitting dust without increasing the plasma density beyond the limits that may be imposed from x - ray observations .    conducting needles",
    "have been considered before , in a different context , by hoyle & wickramasinghe ( 1999 ) and wickramasinghe ( 1992 ) as a source of starlight opacity that could have produced a non  cosmological cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in a steady state cosmology .",
    "they were also considered as a way to thermalize starlight and generate the cmb after the big bang in cold big bang models ( wright 1982 , li 2003 ) .",
    "it should not be too surprising to find needles in supernova ejecta .",
    "supernovae condensates may originally be different in morphology or composition from the dust particles commonly found in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , and are likely to undergo additional chemical and physical processing in the ism .",
    "there is prior evidence that sn condensates may be different from their ism counterparts .",
    "the hot dust emission from cas  a detected by the _ iso _ was interpreted as emission from protosilicate material ( arendt , dwek , & mosleley 1999 ) , and conducting needles may have been detected in sn 1987a ( wickramasinghe & wickramasinghe 1993 ) .    in the model proposed here ,",
    "the metallic needles were formed in metal - rich ejecta that were expelled at high velocities into the ambient medium .",
    "the needles are collisionaly heated by the reverse shock resulting from the interaction of the ejecta with the ambient medium . in the following section (  2 )",
    "we examine the different dust component contributing to the observed ir to submillimeter spectrum of cas  a , showing that conducting needles are a necessary emission component if one wants to fit the 170  @xmath2 m _ iso _ observations with a reasonable dust mass . in ",
    "3 we calculate the properties of the needles and the electron density required to explain the scuba observations for various type of conducting material .",
    "the results of the paper are summarized and discussed in  4 .",

    "the mass of cold dust may be lower if it has an amorphous or clumpy aggregate structure , for which laboratory measurements and theoretical models give a mass absorption coefficient of @xmath33 = 15  @xmath30 g@xmath31 ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) .",

    "faces more difficulties if the _ iso _ 170  @xmath2 m observations are an actual measurement ( tuffs et al .",
    "the observed flux can then be entirely attributed to the emission from the hot dust component ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "a fit to the scuba observations would then lead to a colder dust temperature and therefore to a significantly higher dust mass , even if it consists of amorphous or clumpy aggregates .",
    "the mass of cold dust depends on the mass absorption coefficient , and can be further reduced if the dust is a more efficient emitter at far - ir and submillimeter wavelengths than the amorphous clumpy aggregates considered by dunne et al .",

    "table 2 lists several physical properties of different conducting and semi - conducting material consisting of elements that are likely to condense out of metal - rich sn ejecta .",
    "the electrical resistivity of metals is generally a sum of two independent contributions : ( 1 ) the resistivity caused by the collisions of the conduction electrons with lattice phonons , and ( 2 ) the resistivity caused by the scattering of the electrons by impurity atoms and lattice defects .",

    "these values suggest that the needles are made of pure conducting material ( iron ? ) that includes about 0.5 to 1% of embedded impurities 4 .",
    "the needles are destroyed by sputtering in the hot gas .",
    "the needle lifetime is shorter than the ionization age of the various x - ray emitting components , suggesting a continuous supply of newly swept - up dust .",
    "the mass of needles required to produce the scuba observations is therefore increased to @xmath101  m@xmath5 if they reside in the cool plasma , and @xmath102  m@xmath5 if they reside in the hot plasma .",

    "the needle model proposed here is consistent with a scenario in which the metallic needles are formed in bullets of metal  rich ejecta that were expelled at high velocities into the ambient medium .",
    "such scenario is similar to the one observed in sn  1987a , in which the increased ionization state of its envelope , the early appearance of x- and @xmath103-rays from the radioactive decay of @xmath104co , and the width of the spectral lines of heavy elements , suggested that metal  rich material from the inner region of the ejecta was macroscopically mixed and expelled at velocities of @xmath3 3000 km s@xmath31 ( graham 1988 , arnett et al .",

    "2002 ) , suggesting that the stellar layers were macroscopically mixed , spatially inverted , and ejected as bullets into the ambient medium in an asymmetric explosion .",
    "the interaction of the ejecta with the ambient medium will drive a reverse shock wave through the ejecta .",
    "the shocked plasma will then collisionally heat the dust to the observed temperature .",
    "the submillimeter emission detected by the scuba from kepler ( morgan et al .",
    "2003 ) may have a similar origin .",
    "conductive needles may be efficiently aligned in a magnetic field , so that the cold dust emission may be partially polarized , depending on the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "the submillimeter polarization from the dust can dominate that from the synchrotron emission .",
    "the detection of polarization at wavelengths @xmath105 m , and a drop in the cold dust spectrum from 400 to 170  @xmath2 m will therefore be definitive confirmations of the proposed model .",
    "the results of our analysis show that the scuba observations need not imply the detection of massive amounts of dust in the remnant .",
    "conductive needles offer a better explanation with only a fraction of the mass inferred by dunne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and morgan et al .",
    "nevertheless , supernovae may yet be important sources of interstellar dust .",
    "here we argue that the evidence put forward sofar is still inconclusive .",
