    "quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) are high - power , coherent light sources emitting in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) and terahertz ( thz ) frequency ranges @xcite .",
    "qcls are electronically driven , unipolar devices whose active core consists of tens to hundreds of repetitions of a carefully designed stage .",
    "the qcl active core can be considered a superlattice ( sl ) , in which each stage is a multiple - quantum - well ( mqw ) heterostructure , where confined electronic states with specific energy levels are formed because of quantum confinement .",
    "the concept of achieving lasing in semiconductor sls was first introduced by kazarinov and suris @xcite in 1971 .",
    "the first working qcl was demonstrated by faist _",
    ". _ @xcite two decades later .",
    "qcls are typically iii - v material systems grown on gaas or inp substrates . molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite and metal - organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd )",
    "@xcite are the techniques that enable precise growth of thin layers of various iii - v alloys .",
    "it is also possible to incorporate strain into the structure , as long as the total strain in a stage is balanced .",
    "both the precision and the possibility of introducing strain bring great flexibility to the design of the qcl active core , so lasing over a wide range of wave lengths ( from 3 to 190 @xmath0 m ) has been achieved .",
    "the growth techniques produce high - quality interfaces , with atomic - level roughness .",
    "mid - ir qcls ( wave - length range @xmath1 m ) have widespread military and commercial applications .",
    "a practical portable detector requires mid - ir qcls to operate at room - temperature ( rt ) , in continuous - wave ( cw ) mode , and with high ( watt - level ) output power .",
    "furthermore , these qcls must also have high wall - plug efficiency ( wpe , the ratio of emitted optical power to the electrical power pumped in ) and long - term reliability under these high - stress operating conditions . as the stress likely stems from excessive nonuniform heating",
    "while lasing @xcite , improving device reliability and lifetime goes hand - in - hand with improving the wpe .      in qcls ,",
    "multiple conduction subbands are formed in the active core by means of quantum confinement .",
    "qcls are unipolar devices , meaning that lasing is achieved through radiative intersubband transitions ( transitions between two conduction subbands ) instead of radiative interband transitions ( transitions between the conduction and valence bands ) in traditional quantum well ( qw ) semiconductor lasers . as a result",
    ", electrons do not combine with holes after the radiative transitions and can be used to emit another photon . in order to reuse electrons ,",
    "the same mqw heterostructure is repeated many times ( 2570 ) in the qcl active core ( the so - called cascading scheme ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bandstructure ] depicts a typical conduction - band diagram of two adjacent stages in a qcl under an electric field .",
    "each stage consists of an injector region and an active region .",
    "the injector region has several thin wells separated by thin barriers ( @xmath2  ) , so a miniband is formed , with multiple subbands that are close in energy and whose associated wavefunctions have high spatial overlap .",
    "typically , the lowest few energy levels in the miniband are referred to as the injector levels .",
    "the injector levels collect the electrons that come from the previous stage and inject them into the active region .",
    "the active region usually consists of 23 wider wells ( @xmath3  ) separated by thin barriers .",
    "consequently , a minigap forms in the active region between the upper lasing level ( 3 ) and the lower lasing level ( 2 ) .",
    "another important energy level in the active region is the ground state ( 1 ) .",
    "there is a thin barrier ( usually the thinnest among all layers ) between the injecting region and the active region , called the injection barrier .        by design ,",
    "the injector levels are close in energy and strongly coupled to the upper lasing level because of the thin injection barrier .",
    "the upper and lower lasing levels have large spatial overlap , which allows a radiative transition between the two levels ; the wave length of the emitted light is determined by the energy spacing between these two levels .",
    "the lower lasing level overlaps with the ground state for efficient electron extraction .",
    "electron emission of longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons is the dominant mechanism for electron extraction , so the energy spacing between the lower lasing level and the ground state is designed to be close to the lo phonon energy to facilitate extraction . with careful design ,",
    "the electron lifetime in the upper lasing level is longer than in the lower lasing level , so population inversion can be achieved . after reaching the ground state ,",
    "electrons tunnel through the injector into the the upper lasing level of the next stage , and the process is repeated .",
    "of course , the lasing mechanism description above is idealized . in reality",
    ", the efficiency of the radiative transition between the upper and lower lasing levels is very low @xcite .      in recent years",
    ", considerable focus has been placed on improving the wpe and output power of qcls for rt cw operation .",
    "@xcite showed 8.4 % wpe and 1.3 w output power around 4.6 @xmath0 m in 2008 . shortly thereafter , lyakh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported 12.7% wpe and 3 w power at 4.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "watt - level power with 6% wpe at 3.76 @xmath0 m and then lower power at 3.39 @xmath0 m and 3.56 @xmath0 m are reported by bandyopadhyay _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated 21% wpe and 5.1 w output power around 4.9 @xmath0 m in 2011 .",
    "much higher wpe and/or output power has been achieved at lower temperatures or at pulsed mode @xcite near 4.8 @xmath0 m .",
    "a summary of recent developments can be found in review papers @xcite .",
    "while good output powers and wpes have been achieved , long - term reliability of these devices under rt cw operation remains a critical problem @xcite .",
    "these devices are prone to catastrophic breakdown owing to reasons that are not entirely understood , but are likely related to thermal stress that stems from prolonged high - power operation @xcite .",
    "this kind of thermal stress is worst in short - wave length devices that have high strain and high thermal impedance mismatch between layers @xcite .",
    "in addition to improved device lifetime , we seek better cw temperature performance ( higher characteristic temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath5 , defined below ) @xcite .",
    "the first aspect is a weaker temperature dependence of the threshold current density .",
    "empirically , the threshold current density ( the current density at which the device starts lasing ) has an exponential dependence on the operating temperature @xmath6 : @xmath7 .",
    "higher characteristic temperature @xmath4 is preferred in qcl design , as it means less variation in @xmath8 as the temperature changes .",
    "another key temperature - dependent parameter is the differential quantum efficiency ( also called the slope efficiency of external quantum efficiency ) , defined as the amount of output optical power @xmath9 per unit increase in the pumping current @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "the differential quantum efficiency is directly proportional to the wpe ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the feeding efficiency ) .",
    "therefore , the higher the @xmath5 , the closer @xmath14 is to unity , and the higher the wpe .",
    "recently , deep - well structures with tapered active regions have demonstrated significant improvements in @xmath4 and @xmath5 with respect to the conventional @xmath15 device @xcite , underscoring that the suppression of leakage plays a key role in temperature performance @xcite . still , the microscopic mechanisms and leakage pathways that contribute to these empirical performance parameters remain unclear .      under high - power , rt cw operation , both electron and phonon systems in qcls are far away from equilibrium . in such nonequilibrium conditions , both electronic and thermal transport modeling are important for understanding and improving qcl performance .",
    "electron transport in both mid - ir and thz qcls has been successfully simulated via semiclassical ( rate equations @xcite and monte carlo  @xcite ) and quantum techniques ( density matrix @xcite , nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf ) @xcite , and lately wigner functions @xcite ) .",
    "inp - based mid - ir qcls have been addressed via semiclassical @xcite and quantum transport approaches ( 8.5-@xmath16 @xcite and 4.6-@xmath16 @xcite devices ) .",
    "there has been a debate whether electron transport in qcls can be described using semiclassical models , in other words , how much of the current in qcls is coherent .",
    "theoretical work by iotti and rossi @xcite show that the steady - state transport in mid - ir qcls is largely incoherent .",
    "monte carlo simulation @xcite has also been used to correctly predict transport near threshold . however , short - wavelength structures @xcite have pronounced coherent features , which can not be addressed semiclassically @xcite .",
    "negf simulations accurately and comprehensively capture quantum transport in these devices , but are computationally demanding .",
    "density - matrix approaches have considerably lower computational overhead than negf , but are still capable of capturing coherent - transport features .",
    "a comprehensive review of electron - transport modeling was recently written by jirauschek and kubis @xcite .",
    "electronic simulations that ignore radiative transitions are applicable for modeling qcls below or near threshold , where the interaction between electrons and the laser electromagnetic field can be ignored .",
    "such simulations are useful for predicting quantities such as threshold current density and @xmath4 . however , in order to accurately model qcls under lasing operations , the effect of the laser field on electronic transport would have to be included . in some cases , the effects of the laser field can be very strong  @xcite , especially for high wpe devices , where the field - induced current can be dominant  @xcite . when included in simulations ,",
    "the laser field is typically either modeled as an additional scattering mechanism  @xcite or as a time - dependent sinusoidal electric field  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we ignore the effect of the laser field on electron dynamics .",
    "thermal transport in qcls is often described through the heat diffusion equation , which requires accurate thermal conductivity in each region , a challenging task for the active core that contains many interfaces @xcite .",
    "it is also very important to include nonequilibrium effects , such as the nonuniform heat - generation rate stemming from the nonuniform temperature distribution @xcite and the feedback that the nonequilibrium phonon population has on electron transport @xcite .    in this chapter ,",
    "we present a multiphysics ( coupled electronic and thermal transport ) and multiscale ( bridging between a single stage and device level ) simulation framework that enables the description of qcl performance under far - from - equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "we present the electronic ( sec .",
    "[ sec : electron ] ) and thermal ( sec .",
    "[ sec : thermal ] ) transport models , then bring them together for electrothermal simulation of a real device structure ( sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] ) .",
    "we strive to cover the basic ideas while pointing readers to the relevant references for derivation and implementation details .",
    "depending on the desired accuracy and computational burden , one can model electronic transport in qcls with varying degrees of complexity .",
    "the goal is to determine the modal gain ( proportional to the population inversion between the upper and lower lasing levels ) under various pumping conditions ( current or voltage ) and lasing conditions ( pulsed or continuous wave ) .",
    "a typical electron transport simulator relies on accurately calculated quasibound electronic states and associated energies in the direction of confinement .",
    "electronic wavefunctions and energies are determined by solving the schrdinger equation or the schrdinger equation combined with poisson s equation in highly doped systems .",
    "section  [ sec : kp ] introduces a @xmath17 schrdinger solver coupled with a poisson solver .",
    "more information about other solvers for electronic states can be found in the review paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "the simulations of electronic transport fall into two camps depending on how the electron single - particle density matrix is treated .",
    "the diagonal elements of the density matrix represent the occupation of the corresponding levels and off - diagonal elements represents the `` coherence '' between two levels .",
    "transport is semiclassical or incoherent when the off - diagonal coherences are much smaller than the diagonal terms , and can be approximated as proportional to the diagonal terms times the transition rates between states @xcite . in that case , the explicit calculation of the off - diagonal terms is avoided and only the diagonal elements are tracked , which simplifies the simulation considerably .",
    "when the off - diagonal terms are appreciable , transport is partially coherent and has to be addressed using quantum - transport techniques , discussed below .",
    "semiclassical approaches assume that electronic transport between stages is largely incoherent `` hopping '' transport .",
    "the key quantities are populations of electronic states that are confined in the qcl growth direction , and electrons transfer between them due to scattering events . the scattering rates can be obtained empirically or more rigorously , via fermi s golden rule .",
    "common semiclassical approaches are the rate equations and ensemble monte carlo ( emc ) , the latter solving a boltzmann - like transport equation stochastically .      in the rate - equation approach @xcite ,",
    "scattering between relevant states , i.e. , the injector level , the upper and lower lasing levels , and the ground state , is captured through transition rates .",
    "the rates include all relevant ( radiative and nonradiative ) scattering mechanisms , and can be either empirical parameters or calculated @xcite .",
    "the computational requirements of rate - equation models are low , so they are suitable for fast numerical design and optimization of different structures @xcite .",
    "the heterostructure in the qcl active core is a quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) system , where electrons are free to move in the @xmath18 plane , while confined cross - plane , in the @xmath19direction ; the confinement results in the formation of quasibound states and discrete energy levels corresponding to the bottoms of 2d energy subbands .",
    "the electron wavefunctions in 3d are plane waves in the @xmath18 plane and confined wavefunctions in @xmath20 .",
    "electronic transport is captured by a boltzmann - like semiclassical transport equation @xcite , which can be solved via the stochastic emc technique assuming instantaneous hops between states in 3d due to scattering @xcite .",
    "the simulation explicitly tracks the energy level and in - plane momentum of each particle in the simulation ensemble ( typically @xmath21 particles ) .",
    "tracking in - plane dynamics makes it more detailed than the rate - equation model .",
    "the transition rates are generally computed directly from the appropriate interaction hamiltonians , and therefore depend on the energy levels as well as the wavefunction overlaps between different electronic states @xcite .",
    "emc allows us to include nonequilibrium effect into transport , which is covered in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : emc ] .",
    "density matrix and negf are the two most widely used techniques to describe quantum transport in qcls .",
    "recently , a wigner - function approach was also successfully used to model a superlattice @xcite .      in semiclassical approaches ,",
    "the central quantity of interest is the distribution function @xmath22 , the probability of an electron occupying an eigenstate @xmath23 and having an in - plane kinetic energy @xmath24 .",
    "the quantum - mechanical analogue is the single - electron density matrix , @xmath25 , where the diagonal elements @xmath26 are occupations and the off - diagonal elements @xmath25 are the spatial coherences between states @xmath23 and @xmath27 at the in - plane energy @xmath24 .",
    "when employing semiclassical methods , off - diagonal matrix elements are assumed to be much smaller than diagonal elements .",
    "this approximation may fail in some cases , for example , when two eigenstates with a large spatial overlap have similar energies .",
    "this scenario often arises when modeling terahertz qcls  @xcite , but can also come up in mid - ir qcls  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "semiclassical models fail .",
    "the density - matrix models that have been employed for qcl modeling can be categorized into two groups .",
    "the first includes hybrid methods , where transport is treated semiclassically within a region of the device ( typically a single stage ) while the effects of tunneling between different regions , separated by barriers , is treated quantum mechanically using a density - matrix formalism with phenomenological dephasing times  @xcite .",
    "the second group involves completely quantum - mechanical methods that rely on microscopically derived markovian master equations that guarantee positivity of the density matrix  @xcite .",
    "both methods are more computationally expensive than their semiclassical counterparts , because the density matrix contains many more elements than its diagonal semiclassical analogue .",
    "the nonequilibrium green s function technique ( see a good overview in @xcite ) relies on the relationships between single - particle time - ordered green s functions and correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the correlation function @xmath28 , often referred to as the lesser green s function  @xcite , is one of the central quantities and can be understood as a two - time generalization of the density matrix , where @xmath29 refers to the magnitude of in - plane wave vector .",
    "the correlation function contains both spatial correlations ( terms with @xmath30 ) as well as temporal correlations between times @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( not included in semiclassical or density - matrix models ) .",
    "typically , the potential profile is assumed to be time independent , in which case the correlation function only depends on the time difference @xmath33 .",
    "fourier transforming over the time difference into the energy domain gives the energy - resolved correlation function @xmath34 , which is the quantity which is usually solved for numerically  @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of the negf formalism are that it provides spectral ( energy - resolved ) information and it includes the effects of collisional broadening ( the broadening of energy levels due to scattering ) , which is particularly important when the states are close in energy .",
    "these advantages carry a considerable computational cost , so negf calculations are much more time consuming than density - matrix approaches  @xcite .      here , we focus on presenting semiclassical modeling of electron transport in qcl structures via emc @xcite .",
    "the solver consists of two parts , a coupled schrdinger  poisson solver and a transport kernel .",
    "we solve for the electronic states using the coupled schrdinger ",
    "poisson solver and feed the energy levels and the wavefunctions of the relevant electronic states to the transport kernel .",
    "the transport kernel keeps track of the electron momentum , energy , and distribution among subbands .",
    "if the electron density inside the device is high , transport kernel will periodically feed the electron distribution back to the schrdinger ",
    "poisson solver and update the electronic states .",
    "this loop is repeated until the electron distribution converges . by doing so",
    ", we solve for both electron transport and the electronic band structure self - consistently .",
    "since the active qcl core consists of repeated stages , the wavefunctions in any stage can be obtained from the wavefunctions in any other stage by translation in space and energy .",
    "this translational symmetry makes it possible to simulate electron transport in only one generic central stage instead of in the whole qcl core @xcite .",
    "typically , electronic states in nonadjacent stages have negligible overlap , which also means that the transition rates between them are negligible . as a result , it is sufficient to limit interstage scattering events to only those between adjacent stages .",
    "figure  [ fig : emcsche ] shows a schematic of three adjacent stages under an applied field .",
    "we simulate electron transport in the central stage @xmath35 , while nearest - neighbor interstage ( @xmath36 ) and intrastage ( @xmath37 ) scattering is allowed .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) are applied in the simulation , i.e. , whenever one electron scatters from the central stage out to the next stage ( process @xmath38 ) , an electron scatters from the previous stage into the central stage ( process @xmath39 ) and vice versa ( process @xmath40 and process @xmath41 ) .",
    "pbcs are justified by the cascading scheme .",
    "we employ the @xmath17 method to solve the schrdinger equation and couple it to a poisson solver @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 method is an efficient way to solve for the electronic band structure near the band edges , where the transport happens in qcls .",
    "the @xmath17 method considers the contribution from the conduction band ( c ) , light - hole band ( lh ) , and the spin - orbit split - off band ( so ) ( the heavy - hole band ( hh ) decouples from the other three at the band edge ) @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the lh and so are especially important for narrow - gap materials , such as inp .",
    "moreover , in modern qcls , strain - balanced structures have been employed to obtain enhanced performance . in these structures , alternate layers",
    "are compressively or tensilely strained while the whole structure is strain free , with carefully designed thickness of each layer .",
    "the @xmath17 method allows for convenient inclusion of the effects of strain on the band structure .",
    "the implementation details of the @xmath17 solver can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 solver can only solve for a finite structure rather than an infinite periodic one . as a result",
    ", we need to simulate a finite number of stages and add artificially high barriers to the two ends to confine all the states .",
    "if a stage is far enough from the boundaries , the calculated band structure in it should be the same as if we were to solve for the whole periodic structure .",
    "tests have confirmed that three stages , which we also use in emc , are enough when solving for the electronic states to ensure that the central - stage states are unaffected by the simulation - domain potential boundaries .",
    "the states from the central stage are then translated in energy and position to the neighboring stages according to the stage length and the applied electric field .",
    "when we need to solve for electron transport and electronic states self - consistently , it is necessary for the solver to be able to automatically pick out the electronic states belonging to the central stage .",
    "one intuitive criterion is to calculate the `` center of mass '' for each state ( the expectation value of the cross - plane coordinate , @xmath42 ) and assign those falling in the central stage to that stage .",
    "however , in our three - stage scheme , this method may pick up the states that are too close to the boundary .",
    "one can either extend the number of stages in the @xmath17 solver to five , so the three stages in the middle are all far from the boundary , or use additional criteria , such as that there be more than 50% possibility of finding an electron in the central stage , based on the probability density distribution , or requiring that the location of the probability - density peak be in the central stage .",
    "additional criteria requiring strong confinement of states have been explored in @xcite .",
    "the emc kernel tracks the hopping transitions of electrons between subbands and stages until convergence , and outputs the transport information for us to calculate the experimentally relevant quantities such as current and modal gain @xcite . in the transport kernel , both electron  electron interactions and electron ",
    "lo - phonon interactions are considered .",
    "other scattering processes such as intervalley scattering , impurity scattering , interface roughness scattering can be considered under different circumstances @xcite .",
    "photon emission is not considered , either . because emc tracks individual particles , nonequilibrium electron transport can be automatically captured .",
    "( emc tracks individual simulation particles , each of which might represent thousands of real electrons . )",
    "the most important scattering mechanism in qcls is electron  lo - phonon scattering , which facilitates the depopulation of the lower lasing level .",
    "as shown in @xcite , phonon confinement has little effect on the electronic transport , therefore , for simplicity , lo phonons are treated as bulklike dispersionless phonons with energy @xmath43 .",
    "the transition rate between an initial state @xmath44 with energy @xmath45 and a final state @xmath46 with @xmath47 can be derived from fermi s golden rule as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electronic charge while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are static and high - frequency electronic permittivities of the material , respectively .",
    "the integrals are over the in - plane kinetic energy @xmath24 of the final state and the cross - plane momentum transfer @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is the in - plane momentum transfer .",
    "latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : oi }    is defined as the overlap integral ( oi ) between the initial and final states , where @xmath52 is the cross - plane momentum transfer .",

    "@xmath60 represents the number of lo phonons with momentum @xmath61 .",

    ", position and momentum can not both be determined simultaneously .",
    "since our electrons are all confined in the central stage ( @xmath63 is finite ) , the cross - plane momentum is not exactly conserved during the scattering process ( @xmath64 ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis does not affect the momentum conservation in the @xmath18 plane , because we assume infinite uncertainty in position there .",
    "previously , the cross - plane momentum conservation has been considered through the momentum - conservation approximation ( mca ) @xcite and a broadening of @xmath52 according to the well width @xcite .",
    "the mca forbids a phonon emitted between subbands @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be re - absorbed by another transition between @xmath67 and @xmath68 if @xmath69 or @xmath70 , and thus might underestimate the electron - lo interaction strength @xcite .",
