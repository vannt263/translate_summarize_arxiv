    "the area of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit qed ) has experienced a series of expressive advances during the twelve years of its existence cir2,cir4,cir5,cir3,science . originally aimed at the coherent coupling of superconducting artificial two - level atoms ( _ qubits _ ) to the quantized electromagnetic ( em ) field confined in 1d resonator @xcite , this area currently embraces a plethora of experimental architectures with different kinds of multi - level artificial atoms and sophisticated assemblies of interconnected 3d and 1d resonators and waveguides transmon , majer , paik , apl , wilson .",
    "diverse designs incorporating up to tens of josephson junctions give rise to artificial atoms with distinct properties regarding the dissipation mechanisms and energy levels structure @xcite .",
    "still , all they have in common the capability of coherently coupling to the em  field @xcite , and several atoms and resonators can be incorporated into single packages that store and process quantum information @xcite .",
    "certain types of artificial atoms permit a real - time manipulation of the internal properties , such as the energy levels splitting or the atom  field coupling strength @xcite .",
    "combined with the ability of rapidly tuning _ in situ _ the resonator effective frequency by external magnetic flux @xcite this architecture enables one to access a novel regime of light  matter interaction in which all the parameters of the system hamiltonian are regarded as time - varying functions controlled externally @xcite .",
    "when these parameters are modulated by a single or a superposition of weak harmonic perturbations , under resonance conditions one can engineer new forms of light ",
    "matter interaction that were not reachable in the stationary case @xcite .",
    "this attribute has already been employed for experimental implementation blais - exp , simmonds of quanta exchange between the qubit and the field in the dispersive regime ( known as red sideband transition or jaynes - cummings regime ) , as predicted theoretically in @xcite .",
    "such coupling relies on the ` rotating '  or jaynes - cummings terms @xcite in the atom  field interaction hamiltonian ( terms that conserve the total number of excitations ) .",
    "more exotic forms of interaction can be engineered by resonantly amplifying the weaker effects of the ` counter - rotating terms '  ( crt ) in the hamiltonian @xcite , e.g. , generation of photon pairs from vacuum ( analogue of the dynamical casimir effect , dce rev1,rev2,rev3,rev4,camop ) , simultaneous creation of a single photon and a single atomic excitation ( blue sideband transition or anti - jaynes - cummings regime ) , generation from vacuum of highly entangled qubit  field states with pairs of excitations , coherent annihilation of pairs of system excitations ( effect dubbed anti - dce in @xcite ) and other more sophisticated phenomena liberato9,etc1,etc2,etc3,relativistic , processing , entangles .",
    "some isolated effects described above can be merged in a coherent manner via _ multi - tone modulations _ , giving rise to a general effective hamiltonian with adjustable coupling strengths @xcite .",
    "besides , these effects could also be implemented using halved modulation frequencies by making use of the second - order resonances ( with respect to the modulation amplitudes ) , although for weak modulations the associated transition rates would diminish by at least one order of magnitude @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe how a new effect reliant only on the rotatingterms  the _ two - photon exchange interaction _  could be implemented in nonstationary circuit qed by modulating any system parameter at frequencies of the order of twice the atom  field average detuning , which can be much lower than the resonator natural frequency .",
    "however , this phenomenon only takes place for an array of @xmath5 qubits ( mathematically equivalent to a multilevel artificial atom in the ladder configuration )",
    ". closed analytical description of the system unitary dynamics is derived for @xmath6 ( section [ sec2 ] ) , but it is shown numerically that similar behavior persists for as low as @xmath7 qubits ( section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "the proposed scheme works only in the dispersive regime of light  matter interaction , and because of effective _ kerr _ nonlinearities just one pair of system bare states can be coupled via single - tone modulations .",
    "we also show analytically and numerically that the photon exchange rate can be enhanced by simultaneous modulation of several system parameters with properly adjusted phases .",
    "the prospects of observing this phenomenon experimentally are discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "our system consists of a single mode of em field  interacting with @xmath0 qubits , as described by the quantum dicke model @xcite or @xmath0-qubit quantum rabi model @xcite ( we set @xmath8)@xmath9 ~ ,   \\label{h1}\\]]where the index @xmath10 labels the identical noninteracting atoms .",
