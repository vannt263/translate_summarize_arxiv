    "several anomalies in the largest scales of the cmb @xcite have been interesting sources of inspiration for constructing models of early universe beyond the standard model of cosmology . for example",
    ", it has been found that there are certain scale - dependent statistical anisotropies in these scales @xcite . before inflation",
    ", the universe is supposed to be inhomogeneous and anisotropic . without active supporting sources ,",
    "these initial relics at the beginning of inflation are wiped out by inflation very quickly . however ,",
    "if the number of e - folds of inflation is minimal , namely not much more than that is required to solve the flatness and the horizon problems of big bang , these initial relics can leave their imprints in the statistics of the largest scales of the density perturbations .",
    "these statistical anisotropies are naturally scale - dependent .",
    "the details of scale - dependence crucially rely on the background source of the anisotropy and the initial quantum states . such relations between the early universe models and observables provide a special window to the physics of the early universe . to properly understand these relations , systematic classification of different relic models and their predictions are necessary .",
    "this is particularly important because the analyses of large scale anomalies are often limited by the cosmic variance . by classifying the relic models , their predictions are classified into packages .",
    "these predictions include the scale dependence and angular dependence of the anomalies , together with other possible predictions on such as spatial curvature and non - gaussianities .",
    "when comparing with data , the package of predictions provide theoretical templates which may provide a unified explanation for several anomalies .",
    "some related new anomalies may be predicted and verified , substantially increasing the statistical significance .",
    "in addition , systematic studies of different anomalies in model - building can tell us not only why they are present , but also which fundamental physics we are able to probe .    with these motivations in mind ,",
    "we note that there are two classes of models with initial anisotropics relics .",
    "the source of the initial anisotropy can either be matter fields , or solely from the gravitational sector .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to compare the predictions of these two classes of models .",
    "for the first type of models , an example of relic vector field has been studied analytically and numerically in ref .",
    "this model gives a specific prediction on the form and scale - dependence of the statistical anisotropy of the cmb .",
    "the dependence of the prediction on the initial quantum fluctuation state is also studied . for the second type ,",
    "a bianchi - type inflationary background model has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the density perturbations in this study was done only numerically . to properly compare them with the first type of models and to make the prediction more relevant to the data analyses , we use the same perturbative method as in @xcite to solve these models analytically .",
    "we examine the angular and scale - dependence of the statistical anisotropy in these two types of models .",
    "in addition , we study the effects of the initial quantum state on these predictions following @xcite , and emphasize how the resulting distinctive scale - dependence can be used as a probe of non - bunch - davies ( non - bd ) vacuum . for earlier works considering anisotropies generated from initial anisotropies in metric with non - bd vacuum see @xcite .",
    "the imprint of non - bd initial condition in models of anisotropic inflation @xcite was also studied in @xcite .",
    "we start with the minimal model of inflation based on a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity [ action ] s= d^4 x , in which @xmath0 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "before inflation reaches its attractor isotropic frw phase , the expansion rates along different spatial directions may be different .",
    "the difference can be modeled by the type i bianchi universe , with the metric [ bian0 ] ds^2 = - dt^2 + a^2 d x^2 + b^2(d y^2 + d z^2 ) .",
    "note that to simplify the analysis , we have assumed that there is a remnant two - dimensional symmetry in @xmath1 plane . later on we consider the most general case in which all three directions are anisotropic .",
    "considering the following ansatz for the scale factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the metric ( [ bian0 ] ) becomes [ bian01 ] ds^2 & = & - dt^2 + e^2(t)(d x^2 + e^6(t)(d y^2 + d z^2 ) ) . with the metric in this form ,",

    "we are interested in small anisotropies so we can solve the above equation perturbatively .",
    "since the effect of bianchi anisotropy has been parameterized by @xmath15 , we would expect that all modes , either near the horizon or well inside the horizon , are affected by the anisotropy of this order .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , in order to see this explicitly a proper change of variables in ( [ mode function ] ) is necessary . in the following ,",
    "first we solve equation using the original variable @xmath16 .",
    "as we will see , the expansion breaks down for modes deep inside the horizon .",
    "we improve our expansion scheme by changing to a new variable and present an expansion which is suitable for both near horizon and uv modes .",

    "we determine @xmath18 by using the following normalization condition = i ( 2)^3 ^3(+ ) , where @xmath21 is the momentum conjugate associate with @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the above condition leads to the following equation ( 1 + 2 ( ) ( _ 0 ) ^3 ) ( u_q u_q^ * - u_q^ * u_q^ ) = i . since @xmath24 , we just keep the leading constant term .",
    "it turns out that only @xmath25 plays role while the other higher terms are exponentially suppressed .",
    "we get [ c plus0 ] |_+|^2 = 1 + _ 0 ( 1 + 3 ^2 ) , in which the amplitude of momentum @xmath26 and the angle @xmath27 are defined as k^2 k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2  ,   k_x / k  .",
    "[ k_definition ]      one might have some doubts in the above expansion scheme because it breaks down for short wavelength modes @xmath20 due to the last term ( [ alpha5value ] ) .",
    "physically we do not expect this to happen .",
    "this problem is especially important if we would like to study the effect of anisotropic relics on the short wavelength modes .",
    "so to demonstrate explicitly the validity of our method , we have to elaborate the expansion scheme .",
    "it turns out that this can be fixed by properly choosing the variable used in the perturbative method .",
    "the expansion will be perturbative for all modes if we choose to perturbatively expand the exponent in the variable @xmath16 @xcite . defining [ psi u ] _ ( ) , we expand @xmath28 in orders of @xmath29 _ ( ) = _",

    "the statistical anisotropy in the finite result shows up through the coefficient @xmath35 we just computed .",
    "we thus have [ power - anis ] ( ) ^2 = p_0 ( 1 + _ 0 ( 1 + 3 ^2 ) ) , where the isotropic power spectrum is defined via @xmath36 .",
    "now we can compare this result with that in the model of relic vector field @xcite . in both models ,",
    "the anisotropy is axial symmetric , so as expected they have the same angular - dependence . but due to the different sources , the anisotropies in these two types of models have different scale - dependence . in the relic vector case",
    "the anisotropy decays towards smaller scales as @xmath37 .",
    "however , here in the bianchi type cases in which anisotropy is generated from anisotropic scale factors , it decays as @xmath38 .",
    "these two different behavior are related to the different decay speeds of the background relics in the models .",
    "for inflation with minimal number of e - folds , the initial state of quantum fluctuations also do not have to be in their attractor vacuum states .",
    "it is therefore a sensible question to consider the effects of the non - bd states , and see how the initial quantum states of the universe leave their imprints in the statistical anisotropy of the cmb @xcite .",
    "conversely any distinctive predictions can then be used as a probe of the initial quantum state of the universe . in the following ,",
    "we use a specific example for the non - bd vacuum , namely the gaussian state [ , ] .",
    "as we will see , there are two types of scale - dependence .",
    "one has an oscillatory behavior while the other is not oscillatory . to start ,",
