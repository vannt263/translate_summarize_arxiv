    "the realization of photon - photon interaction at few - photon level has been a research subject of major interest in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the significance of few - photon interaction exists not only for studying the foundations of quantum theory , but also for applications in quantum information science .",
    "specifically , an important goal in the current field of research is the control of two - photon correlations .",
    "such a problem has been discussed in various nonlinear systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that photon - photon interaction can be achieved in nonlinear kerr media , and interesting quantum correlation effects such as photon blockade  @xcite appear in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "in particular , a strong kerr nonlinearity can be achieved through the interaction between light and atoms  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , an optomechanical cavity  @xcite driven by radiation - pressure can be mapped to a problem with a kerr - type interaction  @xcite , and hence provides a different class of systems to explore phenomena of interacting photons through the control of mechanical motion of the cavity mirrors .",
    "indeed , rabl  @xcite has examined the photon blockade effect in a continuously driven cavity optomechanical system operated in the single - photon strong - coupling regime .",
    "in such a regime , a single cavity photon can significantly change the resonant frequency of the cavity field and leads to a range of interesting effects , such as quantum state preparation  @xcite , multiple mechanical sidebands  @xcite , scattering  @xcite , single - photon cooling  @xcite , and optomechanical instability  @xcite .",
    "we note that several recent experimental systems in cavity optomechanics  @xcite are approaching the single - photon strong - coupling regime .    in this paper , we investigate the quantum dynamics of a photon pair interacting with a moving mirror in a cavity .",
    "different from previous studies  @xcite in which a continuously driven system is treated perturbatively , our system confined in the two - photon subspace is exactly solvable and therefore provides a fundamental configuration to study how two photons can become correlated via optomechanical coupling .",
    "we shall focus on the scattering problem in which a two - photon wave packet is injected into the cavity . by treating the cavity field , the moving mirror , and the field continuum outside the cavity as a whole system",
    ", we can solve the quantum state evolution via the wigner - weisskopf method . from the long - time solution",
    ", we identify quantitatively the probability amplitudes associated with various scattering processes inside the cavity .",
    "we emphasize that our exact solution provides a complete description of the full quantum state , including the system s environment , and this is not directly attainable in previous related studies based on the master equation of the system s reduced density matrix  @xcite or approximated operator solutions in heisenberg s picture  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the full quantum state enables us to learn about the details of underlying physical processes as well as the quantum structure of interacting photons in optomechanical cavities . in this paper",
    ", we also calculate the joint spectrum of the two scattered photons . from the joint spectrum",
    ", we can see clear evidence for the photon frequency anti - correlation , which is a qualitative evaluation of the two - photon correlation .",
    "in addition , we calculate the equal - time second - order correlation function of the cavity photons at transient times as a quantitative measurement of the two - photon correlation .",
    "the results indicate that photon blockade is strongly modulated by the optomechanical coupling strength as well as the franck - condon factors involved .",
    "more importantly , we find out the explicit modulation rule of the optomechanical coupling strength based on the two - photon resonance .",
    "the system under consideration is a fabry - prot - type optomechanical cavity formed by a fixed end mirror and a moving end mirror [ see fig .  [ setup](a ) ] .",
    "we focus on a single - mode cavity field , which is coupled to the mechanical oscillation of the moving mirror via radiation pressure .",
    "the moving end mirror is assumed to be perfect and the fixed one is partially transparent . in a rotating frame defined by the unitary transformation @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the total photon number operator , the hamiltonian of the whole system including the optomechanical cavity and the environment reads as @xmath2 here @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 are , respectively , the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the cavity field and the moving mirror , with the respective frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 @xmath10 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the continuous field mode @xmath11 outside the cavity with the resonant frequency @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the detuning ) .",
    "the radiation - pressure coupling appearing in the second term of @xmath14 is characterized by the coupling strength @xmath15 , and the coupling between the cavity field and the outside fields is modeled by the hopping interaction with the coupling strength @xmath16",
    "( @xmath17 is the cavity - field decay rate ) . since the decay rate of the mechanical resonator @xmath18 can be much smaller than @xmath17",
    ", we will neglect the dissipation of the mechanical resonator in our discussions .",
    "this is justified as long as the scattering processes are completed in a time much shorter than @xmath19 .    in this paper , we will focus on the two - photon scattering problem . because the total photon number is a conserved quantity , the hilbert space for the photon part in this problem",

    "the above analysis expatiated the physical picture for creation of two - photon correlation .",

    "the state @xmath87 is an entangled state involving these outside fields and the mirror .",
    "we can understand this entanglement from the dependence of the emitted photon modes on the mirror s final state @xmath88 . in the scattering process",
