    "_ computable set theory _ is a research field studying the decidability of the satisfiability problem for collections of set - theoretic formulae ( also called _ syllogistics _ ) .",
    "the main results in computable set theory up to 2001 have been collected in @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the most efficient decision procedures have been implemented in the proof verifier @xcite and form its inferential core .",
    "most of the decidability results established in computable set theory regard one - sorted multi - level syllogistics , namely collections of formulae involving variables of one type only , ranging over the von neumann universe of sets . on the other hand ,",
    "few decidability results have been proved for multi - sorted stratified syllogistics , admitting variables of several types .",
    "this , despite of the fact that in many fields of computer science and mathematics often one deals with multi - sorted languages .    an efficient decision procedure for the satisfiability of the two - level syllogistic language ( @xmath3 ) , a fragment admitting variables of two sorts for individuals and sets of individuals , basic set - theoretic operators such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the relators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and propositional connectives , has been presented in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite , the extension of @xmath3with the singleton operator and the cartesian product operator has been proved decidable .",
    "tarski s and presburger s arithmetics extended with sets have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the three - sorted language @xmath10(three - level syllogistic with singleton , powerset , and general union ) , allowing three types of variables , and the singleton , powerset , and general union operators , in addition to the operators and predicates already contained in @xmath3 , has been proved decidable in @xcite .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , the three - level quantified syllogistic @xmath11 , involving variables of three sorts has been shown to have a decidable satisfiability problem .",
    "later , in @xcite , the satisfiability problem for @xmath12 , a four - level quantified syllogistic admitting variables of four sorts has been proved to be decidable .",
    "the latter result has been exploited in @xcite to prove that @xmath13 , an expressive description logic , has the consistency problem for its knowledge bases decidable .    in this paper",
    "we present a decidability result for the satisfiability problem of the set - theoretic language @xmath0 ( three - level quantified syllogistic with finite enumerations and restricted quantifiers ) , which is a three - sorted quantified syllogistic involving _ individual variables _ , _ set variables _ , and _ collection variables _ , ranging respectively over the elements of a given nonempty universe @xmath14 , over the subsets of @xmath14 , and over the collections of subsets of @xmath14 . the language of @xmath0 admits the predicate symbols @xmath7 and @xmath8 and a restricted form of quantification over individual and set variables .",
    "@xmath0 extends the fragment @xmath11presented in @xcite since it admits the finite enumeration operator @xmath1 over individual variables . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", @xmath0 allows one to express several constructs of set theory . among them ,",
    "the most comprehensive one is the set former , which in turn allows one to express other set - theoretic operators like several variants of the powerset and the unordered cartesian product .",
    "we will present two different @xmath0 representations of the latter construct : the first , more straightforward one involves finite enumerations and has linear length in the size of the unordered cartesian product , the second one does not involve finite enumerations , is exponentially longer than the first representation , and is expressible also in @xmath11 .",
    "we will prove that @xmath0 enjoys a small model property by showing how to extract , out of a given model satisfying a @xmath0-formula @xmath2 , another model of @xmath2 but of bounded finite cardinality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ genericlanguage ] , we describe the syntax and semantics of a more general language , denoted @xmath15 , which contains @xmath0 as a proper fragment .",
    "subsequently , in section [ machinery ] the machinery needed to prove our main decidability result is provided . in section [ satisfiability ] , the small model property for @xmath0",
    "is established , thus solving the satisfiability problem for @xmath0 .",
    "then , in section [ expressiveness ] , we show how @xmath0 can be used to express several set theoretical operators . finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we begin by defining the syntax and the semantics of the more general three - level quantified language @xmath15 .",
    "then , in section [ restrictionquant ] , we show how to characterize @xmath0-formulae by suitable restrictions on the usage of quantifiers in formulae of @xmath15 .",
