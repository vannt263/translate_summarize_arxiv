    "the exact unitarity in coupled channels together with dispersion relations @xcite , the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite or the equivalent solution in terms of coupled bethe salpeter equations @xcite introduce a nonperturbative scheme that proves highly efficient to study meson - meson or meson - baryon interactions , usually referred to as the chiral unitary approach . by fixing a minimum of subtraction constants or",
    "cut offs to regularize the loops , one finds a fair agreement with data in a vast amount of reactions @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the results of these studies is that the amplitudes have sometimes poles that can be associated to known resonances .",
    "sometimes new resonances are predicted , like a second @xmath7 @xcite or a second @xmath8 axial vector meson @xcite , for which experimental support has been found in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "so far , resonances have been investigated in the interaction of the su(3 ) octet of the pseudoscalar mesons of the @xmath9 with themselves @xcite , which provide the low lying scalar mesons , the interaction of the pseudoscalar mesons with the octet of baryons of the @xmath10 , which generate @xmath11 baryonic resonances @xcite , the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons with the decuplet of the @xmath12 @xcite , which leads to @xmath13 baryon resonances , and the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons with vector mesons , which leads to axial vector meson resonances @xcite .",
    "yet , the interaction of vector mesons with themselves has not been tackled from this perspective .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study this interaction and show how , also in this case , one obtains dynamically generated resonances .",
    "the interaction of vector mesons with themselves is done using the lagrangians of hidden gauge formalism , which mix vector mesons with pseudoscalars and respect chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the hidden gauge lagrangians for vector - vector interaction do not provide local chiral lagrangians as in the case of meson - meson or meson - baryon interaction discussed above .",
    "non local terms corresponding to the exchange of vector mesons appear in the amplitudes . yet , under certain approximations these terms",
    "can also be recast in the form of local lagrangians similar to those quoted above . in this first paper on the issue",
    "we shall describe the formalism and apply it to study the @xmath14 interaction .",
    "we shall see that one gets attraction in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels which is enough to produce bound states of @xmath14 .",
    "we shall see that the interaction in the @xmath16 tensor case is stronger than in the scalar one @xmath15 and that the states that we obtain can be associated to the known resonances @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in order to obtain the width of the states we shall also consider their decay into @xmath2 , obtained within the same formalism of @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    "there is work done for both resonances .",
    "the coupling of the tensor resonance to @xmath2 was exploited in @xcite , within the formalism of the iam , and the @xmath4 was obtained qualitatively , at the expense of adding counterterms or higher order that produce the resonance within this formalism .",
    "this does not mean that the @xmath4 is a resonance built up from @xmath2 .",
    "the information on the resonance properties is essentially buried in the counterterms , like in the case of the @xmath1 meson that is also obtained within the iam @xcite starting from the @xmath2 interaction . there",
    "again , the basic properties of the rho are tied to the @xmath17 coefficients of the second order chiral lagrangian @xcite , and its generation within the iam does not mean that one has a dynamically generated resonance from the basic @xmath2 interaction .",
    "indeed , a careful study of the large @xmath18 behavior of the resonance shows that the state remains as @xmath18 goes to infinite , as corresponds to genuine states that are built essentially from @xmath19 , unlike the dynamically generated scalar mesons that fade away in that limit @xcite . in the present case",
    "the counterterms needed in the iam to produce this state in @xcite are burying the information about the nature of the @xmath4 resonance , which , as we will show , gets dynamically generated from the @xmath20 interaction .",
    "work with quark models is also available . in @xcite the @xmath3",
    "is assumed to be dominantly a @xmath19 state , unlike the lighter scalars that are assumed to be largely four quark states . in @xcite the @xmath3",
    "is also studied within the improved ladder approximation of qcd assuming it to be mostly made of @xmath19 components , although , as quoted there , the meson - meson or four quark components are supposed to be important . in @xcite the @xmath3 is assumed to be a mixture of @xmath19 and four quarks , while in @xcite a mixture of @xmath19 components with glueballs is preferred . once again , in @xcite the @xmath19 nature is preferred for the @xmath3 with the quarks of non strange nature . for the case of the @xmath4",
    "there is also work done in @xcite , where the state is assumed to be predominantly a @xmath19 state .",
    "our work will bring a new perspective into this panorama , showing that practically with no freedom ( up to fine tuning of a cut off parameter from values around the natural size ) , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 states emerge as bound states of the @xmath21 interaction evaluated within the reliable formalism of hidden gauge .",
    "we follow the formalism of the hidden gauge interaction for vector mesons of @xcite(see also @xcite for a practical set of feynman rules ) .",

    "this is what is done in the study of the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons @xcite where , for instance , for the scalar - isoscalar channel one introduces the @xmath42 and @xmath43 pairs as coupled channels . in this particular case",
    "the interaction leads to the generation of two scalar isoscalar resonances , the @xmath44 or @xmath45 and the @xmath46 .",
    "it is also seen that the @xmath42 and @xmath43 states largely decouple : the @xmath45 is basically @xmath42 resonance , while the @xmath46 couples mostly to @xmath43 and weakly to @xmath42 , as a consequence of which one has a small width for the @xmath46 in spite of the large phase space for decay into @xmath42 .    in the present work we shall provide the formalism for the @xmath22 interaction and present results for the simplest case , the @xmath20 interaction .",
    "we are aiming at obtaining from this interaction the lightest scalar and tensor mesons after the @xmath46 which is very well reproduced in terms of pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar components . in the pdg @xcite",
    "we find the @xmath4 and the @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath20 system interacting in @xmath47 wave , as we shall do , can lead to different isospin , spin states @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it would be most interesting to see if the results that we obtain agree , at least qualitatively , with the experimental data on this sector at low energies .",
    "in particular , it is challenging to find a reason on why the @xmath4 is lower in energy than the @xmath3 . in this exploratory work",
    "we shall work only with @xmath1 meson , with the limited aim to learn about the structure of these low lying resonances .",
    "the use of couple channels is welcome and should be tackled in the future , but for purpose of studying these low lying resonances , the other channel , @xmath50 , has a mass of @xmath51 , more than @xmath52 higher than the mass of the @xmath3 , and then , as is the case in all studies of meson - meson interaction , this channel can barely affect the structure of these low lying resonances . in any case , its possible effect , through a weakly energy dependent @xmath43 loop function at the energies that we are concerned , can be accommodated by fine tuning the subtraction constants of the regularized @xmath20 loop function , or equivalently the cut off , as we shall do .    starting with the lagrangian of eq .",

    "( [ rhorho ] ) shows three different structures of the vector polarizations , the same number as possible spins of the two @xmath1 systems , and there is some relationship as we shall see below .",
    "the large mass of the vectors offers a technical advantage , since the three momenta of the @xmath1 in the scattering amplitude in the region of energies of interest to us are small compared to its mass .",
    "we shall work in the limit of small three momenta of the @xmath1 where the @xmath59 components are only nonvanishing for the spatial indices , this is , we take @xmath60 for practical purposes ( recall @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the two transverse polarizations ) .",
    "next we want to find the appropriate projectors in @xmath63 in terms of the different combinations of the four polarization vectors .        for this purpose",
    "we look into the loop diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , where the interaction has been iterated to provide the second term of the bethe salpeter equation .",
    "take the term @xmath64 and iterate it .",
    "we get the structure @xmath65 with the contraction of the internal indices @xmath66 and @xmath67 leading , after summing over the possible polarizations , to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the total momentum of the @xmath20 system . since @xmath70 are all external indices , all of them are spatial and the sum above reverts into @xmath71 @xmath72 we shall work in a renormalization scheme which relies upon the function of @xmath73 apart from the two propagators in the loop function , @xmath74 , being evaluated on shell .",
    "the base for it can be seen in the @xmath75 method @xcite which relies upon the potential and the @xmath76-matrix factorized on shell in the loops as a result of the use of a dispersion relation on @xmath77 after imposing unitarity .",
    "another method of work is to recast @xmath74 as @xmath78 .",
    "obviously @xmath79 vanishes for @xmath80 , as a consequence of which it cancels the singularity of one meson propagator and one gets a diagram with a topology as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( the argument is the same when dealing with the off shell part of the other meson ) .",
    "this diagram gets canceled by tadpoles in the calculation or otherwise can be argued to renormalize the lowest order of the @xmath81 potential .",
    "coming from off - shell parts of the polarization sums . ]",
    "the arguments above imply that we take @xmath82 on shell in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) and @xmath83 is negligible and we ignore it .",
    "the argument used above is slightly different for the structure @xmath84 . indeed",
    ", now we have the combination @xmath85 and contract the indices of @xmath66 and @xmath67 summing over polarizations such that we get @xmath86 the fact that the external indices @xmath87 are spatial does not tell us anything on the internal indices @xmath88 which can also be time like .",
    "we can distinguish three cases :    * @xmath89 space like . on shell",
    "we get @xmath90 with correction of @xmath91 that we neglect .",
    "* @xmath92 , @xmath93 or vice versa .",
    "we get non vanishing terms from @xmath94 which are again of the order of @xmath95 .",
    "the whole term is neglected . *",
    "now the term @xmath97 vanishes on shell up to terms of @xmath95 , which we again neglect .",
    "the discussion has served to show that the regularization procedure is slightly different for different combinations of the polarization vectors , and hence , for the different spin terms .",
    "this implies that in dimensional regularization one can not invoke exactly the same substraction constant in all channels but they can not be too different either .",
    "we use cut off renormalization , and the former findings would imply possible different cut offs in different channels but not too different , and they must be of natural size .",
    "we show results in the present paper for different possible cut offs of natural size .",
    "there is another reason to allow for some freedom in the subtraction constants for different spins , since we make the approximation @xmath98 in the exchanged vectors .",
    "given the large width of the @xmath1 meson , a consideration of the @xmath1 mass convolution for the four @xmath1 mesons in the amplitudes has a consequence that this quantity would not be fully negligible for some distribution of masses in the convolution .",
    "we have evaluated the average value of @xmath99 for forward scattering with the convolution of the four @xmath100 and find @xmath101 of the order of @xmath102 , enough to justify our calculations , but inside loops this quantity can be bigger and it is also @xmath103dependent .",
    "once again , these effects could be accounted for by means of fine tunning of the substraction constants mentioned before for different channels .    for practical purposes , in this renormalization scheme",
    "we only need the transverse components in all cases , and in the propagators of the vector mesons we can take    @xmath104 \\rangle=\\frac{\\delta_{ii'}}{q^2-m_v^2+i{\\epsilon}}\\ ] ]    or the same expression with @xmath105 for the second propagator .    after this exercise",
    "it is easy to check that the three independent structures that upon iteration lead to the same structure are given by @xmath106 it is also easy to see that these structures project over the three different states of spin , @xmath63 respectively , by taking states with a certain third component of the spin and writing them in terms of spherical vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "although we have to keep in mind that we will be dealing with spatial components , it is convenient to write these projectors in covariant form such as to easily separate the structures that appear from the lagrangians into the different spin projectors .",
    "so we write @xmath109 where the order @xmath110 in the polarization vectors is understood ( this allows us to write the expressions covariantly without complication in the indices .",
    "we use the covariant formalism in what follows ) .",
    "we must now evaluate the amplitudes for the isospin states : @xmath111 note that we are using the unitary normalization @xcite , with an extra factor @xmath112 such that when summing over intermediate states of identical particles we obtain the resolution of the identity , i.e. @xmath113 .",
    "one must correct the final amplitudes for the `` wrong '' normalization on the external legs , with a global normalization factor that does not affect the search for the poles or the energy dependence of the amplitudes .",
    "we also take the phase convention @xmath114 of isospin .    by using the isospin wave functions and the lagrangian of eq .",

    "thus we have @xmath119 the interaction is repulsive , however we still have to evaluate the contribution from the vector exchange mechanisms . in @xmath120",
    "we get the amplitude @xmath121 which by means of the spin projection structures leads to @xmath122 we can see that the interaction in the @xmath15 channel is repulsive but the one in @xmath123 is attractive . we still need , however , the contribution of the vector exchange terms . note again that according to the rule @xmath118 we do not get contribution of @xmath117 for @xmath120 . in @xmath124",
    "we obtain the amplitude @xmath125 which projected over spin states leads to @xmath126",

    "similarly all terms of the type @xmath130 , @xmath131 can be neglected and only the terms @xmath132 remain , since the exchanged vector can be time like ( the only component that survives ) . as a consequence our amplitude gets much simplified and we obtain @xmath133 with a unique spin structure , which can be recast , using momentum conservation into @xmath134 the approximations done here are the same ones that one would do for the interaction of a vector with a pseudoscalar and which lead to the local chiral lagrangian of @xcite used to generate axial vector mesons in @xcite .",
    "this example serves to place our approximations in a due perspective , since such approximations are implicit in most of the effective chiral lagrangians used in the literature @xcite , which can be deduced from the formalism of the hidden gauge lagrangians that we are using here .    before proceeding",
    "further one must evaluate the amplitudes for the different isospin states and we obtain @xmath135 which already projects over @xmath117 , as it should , such that @xmath136 the case of @xmath137 is more subtle because , unlike the case of the contact term , we have now a @xmath39 and @xmath40 exchange channel , see fig .",

    "we come back to these issues with a detailed evaluation .",

    "since we are concerned about the width of the resonances , we , thus , consider the @xmath9 exchange between two @xmath1 mesons in the @xmath39 channel as mostly off shell and implement empirical form factors used in the decay of vector mesons in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we use @xmath205 in each @xmath189 vertex with @xmath206 and @xmath207 the running variable in the integral .",
    "we shall evaluate the results for different values of @xmath208 around @xmath209 , which are the values chosen in @xcite,@xcite .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , the calculations are done without form factors .",
    "their consideration does not change the conclusions that follow . concerning the real parts , in the case of @xmath123 we observe that the most important contribution is the potential coming from the contact term and the @xmath1-exchange , which is very large and attractive , whereas the other terms are practically zero .",
    "for @xmath156 we observe that the individual contributions of the @xmath42-box diagram , crossed-@xmath42-box diagram and @xmath213 term are comparatively larger with respect to the contact plus @xmath1-exchange term than in the case of @xmath123 . yet",
    ", we find a quite good cancellation of the @xmath42 box plus crossed-@xmath42 box and anomalous-@xmath213 box terms , and the interaction is dominated by the contact plus @xmath1-exchange terms .",
    "however , the relatively larger contribution of the subdominant terms indicates that we should admit larger uncertainties in the position of the @xmath3 state than in the @xmath4 one . for the imaginary parts we see that the term of the @xmath42 box , which allows for the decay of @xmath20 in @xmath42 , is considerably larger than the others , and we obtain that the crossed-@xmath42 box ( decay in @xmath172 ) only accounts for the @xmath235 of the @xmath42 box , whereas the anomalous-@xmath213 box is zero in our region of interest .",
    "as we see , the crossed terms are reasonably smaller than the direct ones .",
    "we use this fact to omit the calculation of the crossed pion terms corresponding to the convolution of the two @xmath100 .",
    "this convolution implicitly includes the contribution of four intermediate pions when the two meson decay each into two pions .",
    "we could make one of two pions from one @xmath1 to be reabsorbed by the other @xmath1 .",
    "we saw that the convolution of the @xmath100 gave rise to a moderate width compared with the direct @xmath42 box . since the crossed-@xmath42 box gives a smaller contribution than the direct term , we can expect the same to occur with the crossed terms from the convolution , giving rise to a small correction to a width which is already much smaller than the one obtained from the @xmath236 decay .",
    "for this reason we omit the evaluation of these terms .",
    "in view of the results obtained in the former section , here we show the results obtained considering only the contact term plus the @xmath1-exchange term and the imaginary part of the direct @xmath42-box diagram .",
    "the @xmath235 extra contribution to the imaginary part of the @xmath42-crossed box term is small compared with uncertainties in the width stemming from the use of the form factor of eq .",

    "the experimental situation is the following .",
    "the @xmath4 has a width of @xmath240 mostly ( @xmath241% ) coming from @xmath42 decay @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath242 , which should be considered in fair agreement with our results . for the case of the @xmath3",
    "the width is @xmath243 according to the pdg @xcite , with about @xmath244% of the experiments providing a width around @xmath245 in agreement with our findings .",
    "one might wonder whether the scalar state that we obtain , which has a mass around @xmath246 , could not correspond to the @xmath247 .",
    "however , its width of about @xmath248 , out of which only 35% comes from @xmath249 decay @xcite , clearly excludes it from being associated to the state that we have obtained around @xmath246 . on the other hand ,",
    "preliminary data from the belle collaboration suggest that the peak of the mass of the @xmath3 appears rather around @xmath250 @xcite , which would agree better with our findings .",
    "yet , one should also take into consideration the thorough study of @xcite , making a strong claim in favor of the @xmath3 with a mass around the nominal one of the pdg .",
    "incidentally , this latter analysis relies upon a dispersive term dominated by @xmath20 components .",
    "our model provides some @xmath172 decay coming from the @xmath2 decay of each @xmath1 , which has been taken into account by means of the convolution with the @xmath1 mass distribution .",
    "also the crossed-@xmath42 box diagram discussed in section 9 gives rise to @xmath172 decay .",

    "the dispersion on the values of the width gives us an indication of the theoretical uncertainties in this value .",
    "yet , within these uncertainties in the position and the width , one can claim a reasonable agreement with data for these two states providing a big support for the idea of the two states as being dynamically generated from the @xmath20 interaction given by the hidden gauge formalism .",

    "we also found that in the case of @xmath16 the interaction was more attractive , leading to a tensor state more bound than the scalar .",
    "the consideration of the @xmath1 mass distribution gives a width to the two states , very small in the case of the tensor state because of its large binding .",
    "however , the biggest source of width comes from the decay into @xmath42 that we have also studied within the same formalism .",
    "we found the width much larger for the case of the scalar state .",
    "we also studied the effect of the crossed-@xmath42-box diagrams and the contribution of @xmath213-intermediate states with anomalous couplings , which were found to play a minor role .",
    "the states obtained could be associated with the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , for which we found a qualitative agreement on the mass and width .",
