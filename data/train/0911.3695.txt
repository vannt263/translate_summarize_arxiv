    "<S> mesoscopic physics concerns itself with systems which are intermediate between a single atom and a bulk solid . </S>",
    "<S> besides the many intrinsically interesting properties of mesoscopic systems , they can also provide physical insight into the physics of bulk systems . here </S>",
    "<S> we discuss three examples of this from the field of high temperature superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> many interesting electronic materials , especially those that exhibit high temperature superconductivity , lie in an intermediate coupling regime where the strength of the interaction is comparable to the electron bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any small parameter makes analytic approaches to such problems difficult . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in the absence of a small parameter there is every reason to expect the correlation lengths associated with any form of electronic order to be of order 1 in units of the lattice constant ( barring an accident which places the system close to a critical point ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with some sensible analysis ( and with a little bit of luck ) , the properties of the system in the thermodynamic limit may be apparent in the properties of mesoscopic systems , even systems that are small enough that they can be studied by essentially exact numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> here we see how three such studies have provided insight into the high @xmath0 problem .    </S>",
    "<S> following the discovery of the high @xmath0 cuprates there were various suggestions of ways in which the strongly repulsive hubbard interaction , @xmath1 , between two electrons on the same site could ( paradoxically ) produce high temperature pairing in a doped antiferromagnetic insulator . </S>",
    "<S> numerous studies began with the @xmath2 model on a square lattice , which can be thought of as the strong coupling limit of the hubbard model . here </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that @xmath1 is sufficiently large to prevent double occupancy of any site , leaving a one - electron near - neighbor hopping term @xmath3 and an exchange coupling @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> an early argument for pairing was based upon the observation that if one adds two holes to the half - filled ( one - electron per site ) system , then eight exchange @xmath4 bonds are broken if the holes were well separated </S>",
    "<S> . however , if the two holes are placed on near neighbor sites , only seven exchange @xmath4 bonds are broken . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is an effective near - neighbor attraction between the holes . </S>",
    "<S> this picture however was soon seen as more applicable to the phase separation regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , in the context of the resonance - valence - bond @xcite approach , variational calculations using gutzwiller projected wavefunctions @xcite and auxiliary - boson meanfield @xcite calculations found a superconducting state with @xmath5-wave symmetry in the @xmath2 model . from a more weak - coupling perspective </S>",
    "<S> , the idea of spin - fluctuation exchange mediated pairing near an antiferromagnetic instability @xcite was also found to lead to @xmath5-wave pairing due to the increasingly positive strength of the pairing interaction at large momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of these approaches gave a simple , crisp real space picture , especially one that makes clear why @xmath5-wave rather than extended @xmath6-wave symmetry is preferred .    </S>",
    "<S> to address this , trugman and one of the authors @xcite decided to imagine that a 4-site plaquette was extracted from the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the  undoped \" groundstate of the @xmath2 model on a plaquette with 4 electrons is a singlet having a wave function @xmath7 here , @xmath8 creates a singlet pair on sites @xmath9 and we have numbered the sites of the plaquette in a clockwise manner . this state is odd under a @xmath10 rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the two - electron groundstate @xmath11 has spin 0 and is invariant under a @xmath10 rotation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the pairfield annihilation operator that connects the zero - hole ( 4-electron ) and two - hole ( 2-electron ) groundstates of the @xmath12 plaquette must transform as @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the same calculation can be performed for the hubbard model on a single plaquette ; while the wave - functions are somewhat more complex , in this case , the symmetry of the 2 and 4 electron ground - states are invariant for any @xmath1 in the range @xmath14 . as carlson </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite noted , it showed the robustness of the @xmath5-wave character of the pairing in @xmath2 and hubbard models .    of course studies of a 4-site model could not say anything about the possibility of superconducting order . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turned out that studies of 2-leg @xmath2 and hubbard ladders yielded important insights concerning the character of the superconducting groundstate . </S>",
    "<S> the study of 2-leg ladders was motivated by a simple picture based upon the case in which the rung exchange interaction @xmath15 is large compared to the near neighbor leg exchange @xmath16 . in this limit , for the undoped heisenberg ladder , </S>",
    "<S> spin singlets tend to form on the rungs leading to a spin gapped groundstate . </S>",
    "<S> then when holes are added , where @xmath17 , they would occupy sites on either side of a rung so as to break only one exchange rung coupling . </S>",
    "<S> a measure of the spatial correlation of these rung hole pairs would then allow one to probe the superconducting order . </S>",
    "<S> based on this large @xmath18 picture , it was initially a surprise when numerical calculations @xcite showed that at half - filling the spin gap persisted to small values of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the hole doped ladder , despite the fact that @xmath20 , the equal time pairfield - pairfield correlations appeared to have a power law decay , indicative of quasi - long - range  superconductivity \" . in later work @xcite , it was understood that the ladder would have a spin gap at half - filling for any finite @xmath21 , and that the groundstate of the doped ladder is a luther - emery @xcite liquid . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the pair structure is @xmath5-wave - like in the sense that the rung and leg pairfield amplitudes have opposite signs . </S>",
    "<S> we now also know that , in the limit as the length of the ladder tends to infinity , the @xmath2 ladder has perfect andreev reflection in response to an externally applied pairfield at one end of the ladder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 2-leg @xmath2 and hubbard ladders now represent some of the best understood models of strongly correlated electron systems .    admittedly , since the plaquette and the ladder are , respectively , zero and one dimensional systems , neither can support a superconducting phase with a finite transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , in many cases it is possible to analyze the phase diagram of a higher dimensional system constructed as an array of _ weakly _ coupled mesoscale structures , starting from the exact numerical solution of the isolated structure , and treating the coupling between clusters in the context of perturbation theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies of arrays of weakly coupled two - leg ladders@xcite and plaquettes@xcite ( the `` checkerboard hubbard model '' ) lead to rather complex phase diagrams with many competing phases , even where the above analysis shows strong superconducting correlations on the isolated cluster . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , among those phases there are robust regions of @xmath5-wave , or @xmath5-wave - like superconductivity .    as a final example of insights gained from studies of small systems </S>",
    "<S> , we turn to calculations on a 2-leg ladder model of an fe - pnictide superconductor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the typical fermi surfaces of the fe - pnictide materials in an unfolded ( 1 fe / cell ) brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> there are two - hole fermi surfaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 around the @xmath24 point and two - electron fermi surfaces @xmath25 and @xmath26 around @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols indicate the dominant @xmath5-orbital contributing to the bloch state on the indicated portion of the fermi surfaces . in weak coupling </S>",
    "<S> , rpa @xcite and functional renormalization group @xcite calculations suggest that the pairing arises from the scattering of time - reversed - pairs from the @xmath29-dominated states on the @xmath22 fermi surface to paired states with the same orbital character on the @xmath26 fermi surface , and from the analogous processes involving pairs in the @xmath30 dominated states on the @xmath22 and @xmath25 fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] for the @xmath31 pair scattering .     </S>",
    "<S> ( solid line ) , @xmath30 ( dashed line ) and @xmath32 ( dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows illustrate the type of @xmath31 inter - fermi surface scattering processes that lead to pairing in the spin - fluctuation - exchange calculations.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in order to use numerical methods to study these processes in the intermediate to strong coupling limit , the problem needs to be simplified . if we accept that the type of scattering processes shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] capture the essential physics , we can focus exclusively on pair scattering involving two bands and only one orbital . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting two - leg hubbard ladder retains the @xmath29 states along two cuts through the 2d bz , @xmath33 which passes through the @xmath22 fermi surface , and @xmath34 which passes through @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the problem to that of the two - leg hubbard ladder shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a which can then be studied using the numerical density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 and @xmath36 in units where @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> these hopping parameters were chosen to fit the dft calculation of the bandstructure for cuts with @xmath38 and @xmath39 . ; </S>",

    "<S> the repulsion @xmath1 between two electrons in the same orbital was varied in the range 34 in units of @xmath44 .    in the undoped , one electron per site , limit one finds the expected spin gapped groundstate . by applying a magnetic field to one of the end sites of the ladder </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting expectation value of the spin appears as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b . here </S>",
    "<S> one sees  </S>",
    "<S> stripe \"- </S>",
    "<S> like @xmath28 spin correlations which decay with a slow exponential due to the spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> hole doping the system and applying an external pairfield on the end rung of the ladder , one obtains the pairfield singlet amplitudes illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]c . here </S>",
    "<S> a pairfield of unit strength was applied to the left end rung and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]c shows the strength of the induced pairfields @xmath41 ten sites to the right . </S>",
    "<S> the relative positive sign of the pairfield on the rung and diagonal and the negligible value of the pairfield on the legs is expected if the gap changes sign between the @xmath22 and @xmath26 fermi surfaces @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the stripe - like sdw pattern of the spin correlations in the undoped system as well as the structure of the pairfield are consistent with what is found in the rpa calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , what we found most interesting was the relationship between the fe - ladder and the previously studied 2-leg cuprate ladder . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> a has been twisted by @xmath45 and the phases of the orbitals denoted by the shaded sites have been changed by @xmath46 . ; b ) the spin expectation values of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b for the twisted ladder show the spin gapped @xmath47 antiferromagnetic behavior of the familiar cuprate ladder . ; </S>",
    "<S> c ) the induced pairfield correlations of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]c become the familiar @xmath5-wave - like pairing correlations seen for models of the cuprate ladders.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    here in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]a , every other rung has been twisted by @xmath45 and the phase of the @xmath29-orbit has been changed by @xmath39 on each of the sites of the twisted rung . in this way , the rung one - electron hopping matrix element remains @xmath44 , but the leg and diagonal hoppings are changed to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant hoppings on the twisted fe - ladder are along the legs and rungs with only a weak diagonal hopping . </S>",
    "<S> the spin correlations shown in fig .  [ fig:3]b , obtained by twisting every other rung of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b , look just like the spin gapped af correlations of the previously studied 2-leg hubbard cuprate ladder . </S>",
    "<S> because of the twist and the phase change @xmath46 of the orbitals on the sites of the twisted rungs , the pairfield correlations take on the @xmath5-wave - like form shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]c . in short , the twist maps @xmath27 magnetic and sign - changing @xmath6-wave pairing correlations on the fe - ladder into @xmath47 magnetic and @xmath5-wave - like pairing correlations in the cuprate ladder ! finally , it turns out that the ratio of the leg - to - rung hopping 0.57 obtained from the fit to the fe - pnictide dft bandstructure is near the value which was previously found @xcite to give the slowest pairfield decay for a cuprate ladder . </S>",
    "<S> thus this fe - ladder turns out to simply be a twisted version of the cuprate 2-leg hubbard ladder with parameters near those which are optimal for pairing . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a direct link between the physics of these two materials .    </S>",
    "<S> now , as noted by joe in his book _ introduction to mesoscopic physics _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ,  the interest in studying systems in the intermediate size range between microscopic and macroscopic is not only in order to understand the macroscopic limit . </S>",
    "<S> many novel phenomena exist that are intrinsic to mesoscopic systems . </S>",
    "<S> \" here we have only touched on some examples where strongly correlated mesoscopic models have been introduced in the hope that they can provide some insight into the macroscopic high @xmath0 problem . it is natural to ask whether there are nt novel mesoscopic phenomena as well . indeed , there are . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the difference between the even- and odd - legged heisenberg ladders in which the even - leg ladders have a spin gap while the odd - leg ladders are gapless is a mesoscopic width effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also known that while the doped 2-leg ladder goes into a luther - emery phase @xcite , it takes a finite doping to bring the 3-leg ladder into this phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ladders also appear in the striped phase of the cuprates and , a better understanding of the mesoscopic properties of multi - leg ladders may shed light on the recently proposed @xmath39-phase shifted @xmath5-wave stripes @xcite . </S>"
