    "the determinant of the fermion matrix plays a central role in dynamical lattice qcd simulations .",
    "the direct approach @xcite to evaluating fermion determinants typically makes use of the lanczos procedure for eigenvalue estimation of hermitian matrices .",
    "given an @xmath1 hermitian matrix @xmath2 , and an orthonormal seed vector @xmath3 , the lanczos procedure is an iterative process which ( in exact arithmetic ) generates a sequence of orthogonal vectors @xmath4 .",
    "if we define an @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 whose columns are given by the vectors @xmath7 , then we have : @xmath8 , @xmath9 is tridiagonal , and the eigenvalues of @xmath10 converge to the eigenvalues of @xmath2 as @xmath11 .",
    "an alternative stochastic approach to evaluating determinants was proposed in 1996 by bai , fahey and golub ( bfg ) @xcite who observe that a vector - matrix - vector of the form @xmath12 can be expressed as an integral of the function @xmath13 over a modified spectral measure .",
    "an @xmath14-point gaussian quadrature approximation to this integral is then given by @xmath15 the remarkable result @xcite applied in the bfg method is that the abscissa , @xmath16 , of this quadrature rule are given by the eigenvalues of the tridiagonal matrix @xmath10 which is generated by a lanczos procedure applied with seed vector @xmath17 , and that the weights , @xmath18 , are given as the squares of the first components of the corresponding eigenvectors of @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig : error2000 ] shows an example of the results which the bfg method generates on a @xmath19 quenched gauge configuration .",
    "the configuration is a quenched configuration with @xmath20 produced within the current ukqcd research program .",
    "a random gaussian fermion vector , @xmath17 , was generated , and the bfg method applied to evaluate @xmath21 for wilson hopping parameter @xmath22 as a function of the order @xmath14 of the lanczos tridiagonal matrix and of the resulting gaussian quadrature approximation .",
    "to generate an estimate of the `` true '' value for this matrix - vector inner - product for comparison , we arbitrarily averaged the values for order 1991 to order 2000 .",
    "the plot then shows the log of the difference of the @xmath14-th order bfg estimate and this `` true '' value plotted against @xmath14 .",
    "the plot shows a rapid convergence to the `` true '' value ( convergence has occurred at about order 200 ) , followed by what is clearly fluctuations at the level of algorithm precision .",
    "note in particular that the long converged region is perfectly flat , and shows no drift .",
    "checks for a toy model , and the mathematical analysis which we briefly describe here , indicate that the convergence is in fact , convergence to the exact answer , and that finite precision arithmetic introduces no systematic error .",
    "at first sight , figure  [ fig : error2000 ] might be interpreted as good phenomenological evidence that the bfg method is reliable and robust .",
    "a second sight however should disturb a person familiar with the lanczos procedure at finite precision . in finite precision arithmetic",
    ", the lanczos procedure generates clusters of almost degenerate eigenvalues of the tridiagonal matrix @xmath10 where only a single eigenvalue would have occurred in an infinite precision calculation .",
    "these clusters could potentially destroy the convergence of the bfg quadrature sum to the correct infinite precision result since the corresponding abscissa are included multiple times rather than singly in that sum .",
    "we have found however , that when clusters arise , the corresponding weights in the quadrature rule adjust so that the net contribution of the cluster of multiple eigenvalues and weights is equal to that of the corresponding single eigenvalue and weight which would arise in infinite precision .",
    "[ tab : clust_wts ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this effect is illustrated in table  [ tab : clust_wts ] which shows the weights corresponding to a given cluster for a lanczos procedure applied to a model problem which has been chosen so all quantities can be calculated both numerically and exactly and direct comparisons can be made . at iteration 40 ,",
    "the cluster in question contains only a single eigenvalue , and the relative error between the value of the weight as generated by the lanczos procedure and an exact calculation is seen to be @xmath23 . by iteration 160 , the cluster expands to include four almost degenerate eigenvalues ( which typically differ only at about @xmath24 ) .",
    "the individual weights are seen now to differ quite significantly from the correct value , but the sum of the three weights does match the correct value , and the contribution of the cluster to the quadrature is seen to be independent of the size of the cluster .",
    "the eigenvalue clustering effect which is well known @xcite , and the invariance of weights which we have just described imposes strict constraints on the mechanism by which roundoff error corrupts the lanczos procedure . at finite precision , the lanczos procedure still generates a sequence of vectors @xmath25 .",
    "however these vectors no longer remain orthogonal , and no longer tridiagonalise @xmath2 .",
    "we have instead that    1 .",
    "@xmath26 , 2 .",
    "@xmath27 , symmetric but not tridiagonal , 3 .",
    "the tridiagonal matrix , @xmath10 which is , in practice , used to estimate eigenvalues of @xmath2 is given by the truncation of @xmath28 to tridiagonal form ( i.e. the all off - tridiagonal elements of @xmath28 are set to zero ) .    ignoring the very small differences between eigenvalues in a degenerate cluster , the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath10",
    "is given as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the multiplicity of the cluster with eigenvalue @xmath16 , @xmath31 counts the non - unit - multiplicity clusters , and @xmath32 counts the different distinct eigenvalues .",
    "we denote the @xmath30 eigenvectors with degenerate eigenvalue @xmath16 by @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34-row by @xmath14 column matrix @xmath35 relates these eigenvectors to `` ritz '' vectors @xmath36 which are @xmath34-component vectors in the space spanned by the columns of @xmath35 as @xmath37 .",
    "a well established result @xcite for the lanczos procedure is that , in a non - unit - multiplicity cluster , the eigenvectors @xmath38 all generate the same ritz vector @xmath36 ( approximately ) .",
    "further this ritz vector is a true eigenvector of the matrix @xmath2 , and the corresponding eigenvalue is a true eigenvalue of @xmath2 ( approximately ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath35 is therefore seen to be rank - deficient since there are independent linear combinations of columns which equal the same vector .",
    "we have found @xcite that the best way to expose this rank deficiency is to execute a singular value decomposition of @xmath35 . using this singular value decomposition , it is possible to find a special set of orthonormal basis vectors for the space spanned by the columns of @xmath35 . in this special basis ,",
    "the matrix @xmath28 takes a block diagonal form with blocks corresponding to the non - unit - multiplicity eigenvalues of @xmath10 having entries at all positions equal to the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "when @xmath28 is truncated to diagonal form in the normal way , these blocks in the special basis representation become diagonal ( the effect of the truncation is to set all the non - diagonal entries for the non - unit - multiplicity blocks equal to zero ) .",
    "we thus obtain the usual degenerate eigenvalue clusters of the truncated matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the reason that the lanczos procedure at finite precision produces good eigenvalue estimates is thus seen to be a combination of the specially structured nature of the space spanned by the columns of @xmath35 , and of the very special way in which the truncation to diagonal form acts .",
    "the invariance of the sum of weights for a cluster is then explained by the observation that this sum gives the projection of the starting vector @xmath17 seeding the lanczos procedure onto the corresponding ritz vector .",
