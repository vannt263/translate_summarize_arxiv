    "the result of our recent analysis @xcite , in agreement with calculations of other authors @xcite , was that matching the secondary / primary nuclei ratio b / c using reacceleration models leads to values of the spatial diffusion coefficient apparently too large to produce the required @xmath5  flux , when the propagated nucleon spectra are tuned to match the local @xmath6  and he flux measurements . assuming the current heliospheric modulation models are approximately right , we have the following possibility @xcite to reconcile the b / c ratio with the measured flux of secondary @xmath5 s .",
    "the spectra of primary nuclei as measured in the heliosphere may contain a fresh local `` unprocessed '' component at low energies thus decreasing the measured secondary to primary nuclei ratio .",
    "this component would have to be local in the sense of being specific to the solar neighbourhood , so that the well - known `` local bubble '' phenomenon is a natural candidate .    the low - density region around the sun , filled with hot h  i gas ,",
    "is called the local bubble ( hereafter lb ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the size of the region is about 200 pc , and it is likely that it was produced in a series of supernova ( sn ) explosions , with the last sn explosion occuring approximately 12 myr ago , or 3 sn occuring within the last 5 myr .",
    "most probably its progenitor was an ob star association ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite report about an excess of @xmath7fe measured in a deep ocean core sample of ferromanganese crust suggesting a sn explosion about 5 myr ago at 30 pc distance and the deposition of sn - produced iron on earth .",
    "@xcite report an enhancement in the cr intensity dated about 40 kyr ago , which is interpreted as the passage across the solar system of the shock wave from a sn exploding about 0.1 myr ago .",
    "it could also be that `` fresh '' lb contributions from continuous acceleration in the form of shock waves @xcite , and/or energetic particles coming directly from sn remnants still influence the spectra and abundances of local cr .",
    "we use the propagation model galpropaws / aws.html ] as described elsewhere @xcite ; for the present purpose the 2d cylindrically symmetrical option is sufficient .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient is taken as @xmath8 ; the diffusion in momentum space and other details can be found in our earlier papers .",
    "the nucleon injection spectrum of the galactic component was taken as a modified power - law in rigidity @xcite , @xmath9 , for the injected particle density .",
    "the heliospheric modulation is treated using the force - field approximation .",
    "the lb spectrum is taken in the form ( * ? ? ? * for continous acceleration by interstellar shocks ) : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the rigidity , and @xmath12 is the cut off rigidity parameter . in terms of kinetic energy per nucleon @xmath13 this can be re - written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the abundance of a nucleus @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the nucleus charge and atomic number , correspondingly , @xmath18 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath6 is the momentum per nucleon , @xmath19 .",
    "we show the results obtained with @xmath20 , but the particular spectral shape of the lb component is not important as long as it decreases sharply towards high energies and is much softer than the galactic cr spectrum .",
    "the procedure to tune the cr elemental abundances , secondary / primary nuclei ratios , and @xmath5  flux we adopted was as follows . the high energy part of b / c ratio _ and _ @xmath5",
    "flux measurements are used to restrict the parameters of the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while the low energy part of b / c ratio is used to fix a value for the reacceleration level and define the parameters of the lb component . the galactic cr",
    "elemental source abundances are tuned using the cr abundances at high energies where the heliospheric modulation is weak .",
    "the lb isotopic abundances are tuned to match the low - energy data by ace and ulysses .    figure  [ fig : pbars ] ( left ) illustrates the process of fixing the normalization of the diffusion coefficient using @xmath5 s .",
    "the @xmath5  flux shown is calculated with @xmath23 and different normalizations in the diffusion coefficient , @xmath24 cm s@xmath25 at @xmath26 gv ( for @xmath5 s this corresponds to kinetic energy @xmath27 gev ) .",
    "the injection index @xmath28 is taken equal to 2.28 , and the alfvn speed @xmath29 km s@xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath5  flux at maximum , @xmath27  gev , appears to be quite sensitive to the value of the diffusion coefficient and allows us to fix it at @xmath31 cm s@xmath25 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath22 is not critical since we compare with the @xmath5  measurements at maximum .",
    "inelastically scattered @xmath5 s , the `` tertiary '' component , appears to be important at low energies only in the ism .",
    "figure  [ fig : pbars ] ( right ) shows corresponding calculations of the b / c ratio .",
    "a halo height of @xmath32 kpc is used @xcite .",
    "the local interstellar ( lis ) @xmath6  and he spectra used in our @xmath5  calculations are the best fits to the data as described in @xcite .",
    "because of the measurements with large statistics ( bess  @xcite , ams ",
    "@xcite ) , and weak heliospheric modulation above 10 gev , the error arising from uncertainties in the primary spectra is only @xmath33% .",
    "we note that as in the case of other nuclei , there should be an lb contribution to @xmath6  and he spectra .",
    "the galactic injection spectra of @xmath6 s and he should thus be significantly flatter below several gev to match the data points at low energies . this does not influence the @xmath5  production because ( i ) the lb does not produce a significant amount of secondaries , and ( ii ) the @xmath5  threshold production energy is high , @xmath34 gev .",
    "further tuning can be done using the high energy part of the b / c ratio , which is not influenced by heliospheric modulation and supposedly contains only a galactic component of cr .",
    "index @xmath35 is chosen as giving the best match . a pure kolmogorov spectrum , @xmath36 , thus seems to be excluded by @xmath5  spectrum data taken in combination with b / c ratio data .",
    "the low energy b / c data were used to fix the lb spectral parameter at @xmath37 mev , but @xmath38 mev also provides good agreement with b / c data . in this way , we have been able to obtain a model simultaneously fitting @xmath6 , he , @xmath5 , and b / c data .",
    "the galactic cr source elemental abundances are tuned ( at a nominal reference energy of 100 gev ) , by a least squares procedure , to the abundances measured by heao-3 @xcite at 5.6 , 7.5 , 10.6 , 16.2 gev / n .",
    "relative isotopic abundances at the source are taken equal to solar system abundances @xcite .",
    "the key point in the fitting procedure is to obtain the correct abundance of b.    0.48        the lb elemental abundances are tuned simultaneously with spectra using the low energy part of the b / c ratio and isotopic abundances at 200 mev / n from ace @xcite and at 185 mev / n from ulysses @xcite",
    ". for many elements ace and ulysses abundances differ by 10% .",
    "for this reason , to the statistical errors we added 5% systematic error .",
    "the fitting procedure is influenced by the adopted value of the modulation potential .",
    "the following pairs of modulation potentials give almost the same final result : ( ace , ulysses ) = ( 400 mv , 700 mv ) , ( 450 mv , 600 mv ) , ( 500 mv , 500 mv ) .",
    "the data deviate from calculations in both directions , which mean that we are unlikely to introduce essential systematic error by assuming a wrong value of the modulation potential .",
    "the diffusive reaccleration model with an lb component shows good overall agreement with data including secondary to primary ratios , spectra , and abundances .",
    "the derived galactic cr source abundances and lb source abundances are plotted in figure  [ fig : ab - ratio ] relative to the solar system abundances @xcite .",
    "the important result is that cr source and lb source abundances of all major elements ( c , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , ni ) are in good agreement with each other .",
    "abundances of the si group , ca , fe , ni are near the solar system abundances .",
    "abundances of other elements in galactic cr and lb sources are mostly consistent with each other , and with solar system abundances , within a factor of 2 .",
    "relative to silicon , c ,",
    "n , o , ne , s are underabundant both in cr source and lb .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known first - ionization - potential or volatily correlation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "spectra of b , c , o , fe are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] for modulation levels 450 and 800 mv . in case of c ,",
    "the normalization coefficient in the lb component is fixed as @xmath39 cm@xmath25 s@xmath30 sr@xmath30 for @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : spectra],title=\"fig : \" ]    secondary nuclei k , sc , ti , v appear to be overabundant in the lb sources relative to the solar system ( shown as upper limits in figure  [ fig : ab - ratio ] ) , though the derived absolute lb abundances are not large .",
    "the derived lb abundance of ti does not exceed that of cr while the derived abundances of sc and v are not larger than that of mn .",
    "one possible reason for this excess is the uncertainty in the production cross sections , which is especially large for these nuclei .",
    "sometimes there is no measurement at all , while phenomenological systematics are frequently wrong by a factor of two or more .",
    "often , there is only one measurement at @xmath42 mev / n , which has to be extrapolated in both directions .",
    "this allows only a nearly flat webber - type or silberberg - tsao - type extrapolations while the real cross sections usually have large resonances below several hundred mev , and decrease with energy above a few gev ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that @xcite used semiempirical cross sections based on @xcite and also predicted fluxes of sub - fe elements which are too low .",
    "an estimate of the overall error , which is reflected in the derived lb source abundances , can be obtained by assuming the absence of k , sc , ti , v in the lb source .",
    "such a discrepancy is below 20% , and can be _ removed _ by allowing the production cross sections to increase at low energies by @xmath43% , which seems plausible .",
    "another possibility is errors in flux measurements of the rare cr species .",
    "ulysses and ace measurements are not always in agreement .",
    "note that even for such an abundant nucleus as fe , which is the main contributor to the sub - fe group , the discrepancy exceeds 10% , while the disagreement in abundance of sc is @xmath44% .",
    "the derived source overabundance of sub - fe elements in the lb could also in principle arise from composition differences between the ism in the lb and solar or galactic average ism .",
    "this is suggested by the fact that the relative abundances of secondary elements in the lb sources are systematically larger than in the galactic cr sources ( figure  [ fig : ab - ratio ] ) .",
    "be and b isotopes are assumed all secondary , thus there is no possibility to tune them .",
    "our calculation shows perfect agreement with the data on relative isotopic abundances of be and b. this is in contrast with a `` standard '' reacceleration model , where we obtained a 15% discrepancy with relative abundances of be and be isotopes @xcite .",
    "abundances of stable isotopes of other elements are not very conclusive because they are present in the sources , but o and si isotopic distributions still agree very well with data by ace , ulysses , and voyager assuming only @xmath45o and @xmath46si isotopes are present in the lb component .",
    "c and n isotopic distributions do not agree too well , but this may point to a problem with cross sections .",
    "the calculated ratio @xmath47c/@xmath48c @xmath49 at 120 mev / n ( @xmath50 mv ) in the model with lb contribution is still a factor @xmath51 too large compared to the measured value , @xmath52 ( voyager 50130 mev / n , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath53 ( ulysses 100200 mev / n , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may be connected in part with overproduction of   @xmath47c by @xmath54n .",
    "if we replace the cumulative cross section @xmath54n@xmath55@xmath47c with cross section @xmath56n@xmath55@xmath47c , the calculated ratio @xmath47c/@xmath48c will be lowered by 10% as estimated . assuming the absence of the isotope @xmath47c in the galactic cr sources",
    "gives another 10% reduction .",
    "altogether these corrections yield @xmath47c/@xmath48c @xmath57 , close to the data .    in case of radioactive isotopes",
    "be , al , cl , usually used as `` clocks '' in cr , the agreement with the most accurate low energy data by ace is very good and all the ratios are consistent with each other indicating that a halo height @xmath58 kpc is a good estimate .",
    "higher energy data by isomax ( be ) are also consistent with calculations considering the large error bars .",
    "the @xmath59mn / mn ratio indicates a somewhat smaller halo , but this may be related to uncertainty in its half - life and/or production cross section .",
    "the half - life of   @xmath59mn against @xmath60 decay is the most uncertain among the four radioactive isotopes ",
    "it is only one which is not measured directly .",
    "apart from the half - life , a possible source of errors can be production cross sections of mn isotopes .",
    "only the reaction   @xmath61fe@xmath62@xmath59mn on a natural sample of fe has been measured well enough ( see compilation by * ? ? ?",
    "in a previous paper we have shown that the @xmath5  flux and b / c ratio appear to be inconsistent with measurements when computed in standard diffusion / reaccelation models . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated that this discrepancy can be resolved if some part of the local cr consists of a `` fresh '' component accelerated in the lb .",
    "the independent evidence for sn activity in the solar vicinity supports this idea .    combining the measurements of the @xmath5  flux _ and _ b / c ratio to fix the diffusion coefficient , we have been able to construct a model consistent with measurements of important nuclei ratios in cr and derive elemental abundances in the lb .",
    "calculated isotopic abundance distributions of be and b are in perfect agreement with cr data .",
    "the abundances of three `` radioactive clock '' isotopes in cr @xmath1be , @xmath2al , @xmath3cl are all consistent and indicate a halo size @xmath63 kpc based on the ace data .",
    "@xmath59mn indicated a smaller halo , but this may be related to its half - life uncertainty and/or cross section errors .",
    "the derived fraction of lb component in cr is small compared to galactic cr and has a steep spectrum with a cutoff above several hundred mev / n . other experimental data ( except maybe the overabundance of sc , ti",
    ", v ) do not contradict this hypothesis .",
    "the derived source overabundance of sub - fe elements in the lb may be caused by trivial uncertainties in the production cross sections , or could in principle arise from composition and/or evolution differences between the ism in the lb and solar or galactic average ism .",
    "recently there has appeared some indication @xcite that the atmospheric contribution to the @xmath5  flux measured in the upper atmosphere is underestimated by @xmath6430% .",
    "this means that the flux of @xmath5 s in cr in reality may be _ lower _ at the top of the atmosphere by at least 2530% .",
    "if the latter is true , the reacceleration model ( even without lb ) could still be the best one to describe propagation of nucleon species in the galaxy .",
