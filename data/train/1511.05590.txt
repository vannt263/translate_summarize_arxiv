    "in the recent works that establish the factorization theorems for the transverse momentum spectra in drell - yan ( dy ) , vector / higgs boson production , semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and @xmath0 hadrons  @xcite , the soft function ( sf ) plays a central role .",
    "the main building blocks within these factorization theorems are the transverse momentum dependent functions ( tmds ) , which encode the relevant non - perturbative physics .",
    "and the sf enters these tmds in a particular way , in order to cancel spurious rapidity divergences and make them well - defined hadronic quantities .",
    "the sf is defined as the vacuum expectation value of a product of light - like wilson lines evaluated at an space - like distance .",
    "it is an utterly singular object which is undefined without a proper regularization method , and can not be considered as a probability amplitude in the usual quantum field theory sense .",
    "given the way it is introduced and used , the sf is similar to the renormalization constants of quantum field theory ( @xmath2 factors ) , which are undefined without regularization , and has individual physical meaning : while the renormalization constants subtract the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences of diagrams , the sf subtracts the rapidity divergences , the most specific divergences of tmd factorization .",
    "when calculating the sf one faces divergences of different types and only some of them can be controlled by dimensional regularization ( with @xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the origin of these divergences .",
    "the main attention is paid to the rapidity divergences , as they represent the most crucial point in the calculation of the sf .",
    "these divergences arise when loop momentum , denoted by @xmath4 , is boosted in one light - cone direction ( given by the vectors @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , say @xmath8 and @xmath9 , keeping @xmath10 fixed .",
    "the important point is that light - like wilson lines , and therefore the sf , are invariant under the coordinate rescaling in their own light - like directions .",
    "this invariance leads to an ambiguity in the definition of rapidity divergences .",
    "indeed , the boost @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 an arbitrary number ) leaves the sf invariant , while in the limit @xmath14 reproduces the rapidity divergent configuration .",
    "therefore , without a regularization which breaks the boost invariance , the sf can not be explicitly calculated . in this sense",
    ", rapidity divergences can not be regularized by any type of dimensional - like regularization .",
    "there are many ways to break boost invariance and make the rapidity divergences manifest .",
    "one way is to tilt the wilson lines from the light - cone , such that @xmath15 and infinitesimal .",
    "this procedure implies the use of different soft factors to deal with the self - energies of wilson lines and avoid double counting , see e.g.  @xcite . in these works",
    "one combines the unevaluated integrands of collinear and soft matrix elements together to form integrals free from rapidity divergences . implementing these combinations at two loops can be demanding . from the calculational point of view , we find much more economical to have a sufficient regularization for the tmds , such that every diagram gives a finite result .",
    "it also grants a higher universality of the obtained expressions , since many diagrams and even parts of calculations appear in different objects and can be reused .",
    "the sf is a good example of such universality , as once it is evaluated at nnlo , it can be used to calculate all leading - twist tmds at the same order . in this respect ,",
    "the formulation of the factorization theorem of  @xcite is more suitable for a nnlo evaluation and we use it in the definitions of this paper .    given the importance that the sf has per se for the establishment of the factorization theorem , we provide its explicit nnlo calculation in the present work .",
    "the sf is defined as    @xmath16(0^+,0 ^ -,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_\\perp ) \\le[\\tilde s^{t\\dagger}_{{\\bar n}}s_n^t\\ri](0 ) \\left | 0 \\right > } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for soft wilson lines along the light - cone directions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the superscript @xmath22 on wilson lines in  eq .   implies subsidiary transverse gauge links from the light - cone infinities to transverse infinity ( see more details in  @xcite ) .",
    "these links guarantee gauge invariance and are necessary for calculations in singular gauges .",
    "the present calculation has been performed in feynman gauge , where the contribution of transverse links vanishes .",
    "the establishment of the factorization theorem to all orders in perturbation theory relies on particular properties of the sf with respect to the rapidity regulator .",
    "essentially , the logarithm of the sf is at most linear in the logarithms generated by the rapidity divergences ( using the @xmath23-regularization , to be introduced in  eq .   in the next section ) .",
    "this guaranties that the sf can be factorized in two pieces @xcite , and in turn it allows to define the individual tmds . with the @xmath24-regularization this important relation reads @xmath25 where tildes mark quantities calculated in coordinate space",
    ", @xmath26 is an arbitrary and positive real number that transforms as @xmath27 under boosts and we introduce the convenient notation @xmath28 note that the relation in eq .",
    "is exact , i.e. it is valid to all orders in perturbation theory , as well as to all orders in the @xmath29-expansion . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is no general proof of this statement .",
    "consequently , one of the goals of our calculation is to establish the relation in eq .   at nnlo , and thus verify the tmd factorization theorem at the same order .",
    "the fact that one has a unique sf for different processes ( with a different composition of initial and/or final states ) is a direct consequence of the linear dependence on the logarithms of the rapidity divergences .",
    "moreover , one can extract the tmd evolution function @xmath1 @xcite from the sf ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sfp ] ) . in this paper",
    "we obtain it explicitly at nnlo and establish the casimir scaling between the @xmath1 function relevant for quark tmds and for gluon tmds , which is valid to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the realization of the cancellation of rapidity divergences at nnlo within one single tmd has been explicitly checked for the first time in  @xcite for the case of the unpolarized non - singlet fragmentation functions , and its generalization for the whole set of unpolarized tmds is in preparation  @xcite .    in the literature",
    "we have found that an early calculation of the sf was done in  @xcite using just dimensional regularization , which is not appropriate to deal with rapidity divergences . before the development of the current tmd formalism , the universality of soft radiation was discussed in  @xcite at one - loop level . in the context of tmds",
    ", the first soft function appeared in the work of ji - ma - yuan  @xcite . in that work",
    "it was argued that the sf in coordinate space should depend just on the transverse coordinate .",
    "however , the regularization of the sf was done using tilted wilson lines , and properly defining the tmds by using that regulator requires the combination of several types of soft functions , as later discussed in  @xcite . moreover ji - ma - yuan proposed the subtraction of the whole sf in the definition of the tmds , which does not provide a complete cancellation of all rapidity divergences within one tmd .",
    "collins argued in  @xcite that in order to properly define one single tmd it is necessary to combine three soft functions in coordinate space and still use tilted wilson lines .",
    "the computation of ( three ) sf using wilson lines off - the - light cone turns out to be not practical at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the calculation of the sf on - the - light - cone has been attempted by several authors and it is not free from difficulties  @xcite . in  @xcite , for instance , the integrals of the soft function are all scaleless to all orders in perturbation theory , so that the regulator that they propose is not suitable for establishing the tmd formalism ; however it appears to be very efficient for the calculation of the total cross section .",
    "the calculation of the dy cross section done at two loops in  @xcite in this sense is equivalent to the qcd calculation performed in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "the rapidity divergences are regularized by explicitly breaking lorentz invariance through the introduction of a rapidity regulator .",
    "a two - loop calculation of the sf using this regulator has not been performed yet to our knowledge .",
    "the regulator proposed here allows the calculation of a single tmd and has been used for the complete calculation of the non - singlet unpolarized tmd fragmentation function in  @xcite , using the tmd factorization theorem in the eis formalism  @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of wilson lines together with the regularization method that we have used is detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] .",
    "the result of the calculation of the sf at nnlo and the related discussion appears in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sfp ] we discuss the properties of the sf and in particular we argue that the universal evolution function @xmath1 for all tmds can be extracted solely from the sf , both for gluons and quarks .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the technical details of our calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "the sf is written more easily in coordinate space , where it takes the form @xmath30(0^+,0 ^ -,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}_t ) \\bar t\\le[\\tilde s^{t\\dagger}_{{\\bar n}}s_n^t\\ri](0 ) \\left | 0 \\right > } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we explicitly denote the ordering of operators .",

    "are obtained by exchanging @xmath35 and path - ordering @xmath36 with anti - path - ordering @xmath37 .",
    "we notice that these definitions apply for sidis kinematics  @xcite , but as we will show below , the soft function turns out to be universal .",
    "the choice of the ir and rapidity regularization scheme is one of the key ingredients in the calculation of tmds . in our work",
    "we choose to regularize the rapidity divergences with the @xmath24-regularization , that has been already used for the same purpose by many authors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in its original definition ,",
    "@xmath24-regularization consists in setting the @xmath38 prescription of eikonal propagators finite .",
    "however this definition appears to be inefficient for high - loop computations .",
    "in particular it breaks the non - abelian exponentiation property of wilson lines , which is crucial for tmd factorization to hold .",
    "thus , in order to provide a more efficient computation we regularize the uv and ir - soft ( mass ) divergences using standard dimensional regularization with @xmath39 .",
    "then for rapidity divergences we define a @xmath24-regularization scheme at the operator level , which consists in modifying the definition of wilson lines as @xmath40 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & \\rightarrow & p\\exp\\left [ -i g \\int_0^\\infty d\\sigma a_{+ } ( \\sigma \\bar n)e^{-\\d^{+}\\sigma}\\right]{\\nonumber}\\,,\\\\   s_{n}(0)&=&p\\exp\\left [ i g \\int^0_{-\\infty } d\\sigma a_{- } ( \\sigma n)\\right ] { \\nonumber}\\\\ & \\rightarrow & p\\exp\\left [ i g \\int^0_{-\\infty } d\\sigma a_{- } ( \\sigma   n)e^{+\\d^{-}\\sigma}\\right ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 . the modified operator supplies the non - abelian exponentiation property . to be explicit , at the level of feynman diagrams in momentum space ,",
    "the modified expressions for the eikonal propagators are written as ( e.g. absorbing gluons by the wilson line @xmath42 $ ] ) @xmath43 where the gluons are ordered from infinity to zero ( i.e. @xmath44 is the gluon closest to zero ) . as a consequence of the rescaling invariance of the wilson lines (",
    "that is now explicitly broken by the parameters @xmath45 ) , the expressions for diagrams in the sf depend on the single variable @xmath46 .",
    "the ordering of poles in the eikonal propagators eq .",
    "is crucial for perturbative exponentiation with usual properties , such as non - abelian exponentiation theorem on color - factors @xcite or logarithmical counting @xcite .",
    "the origin of these properties is the color - ordering of the gluon fields along the path of the wilson line , that results in a specific nested - commutator structure for exponentiated operators @xcite .",
    "the regularization in eq",
    ".   definitely preserves the ordering , while naive @xmath24-regularization ( with @xmath38 directly replaced by @xmath47 ) corresponds to some involved operator with mixed color - ordering , and violates exponentiation properties . on the level of feynman graphs the problems of naive @xmath24-regularization can be already seen at nnlo , where terms with color factors @xmath48 arise in the exponent .",
    "concluding , within the modified @xmath24-regularization , only diagrams with non - abelian color prefactor ( _ web _ diagrams ) arise in the exponent .",
    "thus , the result is conveniently presented in the form @xmath49}+a_ss^{[2]}+ ... \\)\\ ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the strong coupling and @xmath51 is the casimir of the fundamental representation of gauge group @xmath52 .",
    "the wilson lines in the modified @xmath24-regularization in eq .   do not have the gauge properties of the original wilson lines .",
    "however , the gauge transformation properties are restored in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , only the calculation in this limit is appropriate . in the calculation of feynman diagrams",
    "this implies that terms linear ( and higher powers ) in @xmath24 should be neglected . in this case",
    "the gauge invariance of the final result is guarantied .",
    "important to mention is that a naive implementation of the @xmath23-regulator can cause the appearance of spurious terms that would pretend to violate gauge invariance .",
    "this situation takes place in some diagrams at two - loop level , and in appendix  [ sec : gauge ] we discuss how these terms should be properly handled , and thus gauge invariance recovered .",
    "now , once we have introduced both the object we want to calculate and the regularization scheme we implement , we comment on the general structure of the result . for a generic two - loop diagram ,",
    "dimensional analysis gives @xmath54 where @xmath55 the sign of @xmath56 depends on the kinematics of the sf ( as it can be deduced from eq .  ): it is plus for drell - yan and @xmath57-annihilation processes , and minus for sidis .",
    "when all diagrams are summed up , the final result is linear in @xmath58 at all orders in @xmath29-expansion .",
    "the linearity in @xmath58 ensures the splitting of the sf in two pieces as in eq .  , and",
    "consequently the cancellation of rapidity divergences between the sf and the collinear matrix element inside any given well - defined tmd ( and , therefore , the validity of the factorization theorem as well ) .",
    "moreover , the modulus @xmath59 makes this cancellation independent of the kinematics , being a manifestation of the universality of the sf .",
    "the logarithms generated by rapidity divergences are partially included in the coefficient @xmath60 , which is a polynomial of @xmath61 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 are just functions of @xmath29 .",
    "both @xmath62 and @xmath63 terms cancel exactly in the sum of diagrams .",
    "the cancellation of the sum of the @xmath62 terms comes from the trivial fact that the integrated sf ( @xmath64 ) is null at all positive orders in the perturbative expansion .",
    "thus it would not be necessary to calculate any completely virtual diagram , since they contribute only to @xmath62 .",
    "however we calculate them and explicitly check their exact cancellation .",
    "the cancellation of @xmath63 term has a similar origin .",
    "in fact , the integrated sf should also be recovered by taking the particular limit @xmath65 with @xmath66 fixed .",
    "then , the only way to recover the integrated sf is to set @xmath67 in the sum of all diagrams .",
    "thus , the final result does not contain any fractional powers of @xmath56 . in this way",
    ", the only @xmath24-dependance in the final result is logarithms @xmath61 appearing in @xmath60 .",
    "notice that this cancellation is also expected from the formulation of the relevant factorization theorems , where the sf is implied to be linear in the logarithms generated by rapidity divergences to all orders in @xmath29 , and hence can not contain @xmath68 terms .",
    "the rapidity divergences appear in @xmath60 only as @xmath69 with @xmath70 , but @xmath71 cancels in the sum of all diagrams .    at higher loops we expect a similar structure of divergences in each diagram : at order @xmath19 the general expression for a diagram reads @xmath72 .",
    "similar considerations show that in the sum of all diagrams only the term @xmath73 survives .",
    "diagram - by - diagram , the coefficient @xmath74 can contain powers of @xmath61 up to order @xmath19 , while in the sum of all diagrams only terms linear in @xmath75 remain .",
    "finally , we observe that in order to smoothly recover the integrated sf limit with @xmath65 , for all terms of the type @xmath76 we need @xmath77 .",
    "that is also supported by the loop integrals . in this way ,",
    "all @xmath29-divergences of the final result are of uv origin .",
    "we recall that there are two sources for the uv @xmath29-poles of the final result .",
    "one is the standard surface uv divergence of loop integrals , i.e. when @xmath78 .",
    "another one is the rapidity divergence @xmath79 at fixed @xmath80 .",
    "we stress that the rapidity divergences appear both as uv and ir divergences . from the uv side",
    "the rapidity divergence is regularized by dimensional regularization , while from the ir side it is regularized by the @xmath24-regularization . in the final result ,",
    "the rapidity divergences appear as both @xmath81 and @xmath29-poles .",
    "let us summarize the singularity structure of the diagrams contributing to the sf at two - loop level :    * the poles in @xmath29 can have at most a power @xmath82 . due to the renormalization theorem for wilson lines",
    "@xcite , the @xmath82 poles cancel in the sum of all diagrams .",
    "therefore , the final result has at most @xmath83 poles . * in each diagram there are logarithms of @xmath56 arising from the expansion of @xmath84 ( corresponding to the terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 in  eq .  ) .",
    "up to order @xmath85 one can have at most @xmath86 contribution .",
    "these divergences cancel in the combination of all diagrams at all orders in @xmath29 .",
    "* finally , there are logarithms @xmath87 ( only inside the coefficient @xmath60 ) and in each diagram one can have at most @xmath88 .",
    "the logarithms squared cancel in the sum of diagrams .",
    "the remaining single logarithms are the only dependance on @xmath24 in the final result .",
    "the evaluation of the diagrams for the sf is a delicate process .",
    "one should pay a lot of attention to the analytical properties of loop integrals , since any mistake in the @xmath38-prescription gives rise to phase factors that , multiplied by @xmath82 , result into a wrong combination of singularities .",
    "mistakes of such type are very difficult to trace , and they would result into a breakdown of the tmd factorization .",
    "thus , we make an evaluation of all diagrams in the form shown in eq .",
    ", without any expansion in @xmath29 , in order to trace all factors and singularities explicitly . then , combining diagrams by sectors we check that terms with @xmath84 completely cancel with each other .",
