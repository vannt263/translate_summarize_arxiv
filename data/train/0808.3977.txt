    "the warped extra dimension framework provides a compelling geometrical understanding of a number of mysteries left unexplained by the standard model ( sm ) , most notably the hierarchy problem and the flavor puzzle . in the original randall - sundrum model  @xcite",
    ", a slice of ads bounded by ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) branes was used to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "this setup was subsequently generalized by placing sm fields in the bulk @xcite in order to address flavor issues .",
    "fermion mass hierarchies result from the wavefunction overlap of sm fermions with an ir localized higgs @xcite .",
    "this leads to a fermion geography in the fifth dimension which also naturally suppresses the scale of generic higher - dimension operators that mediate dangerous flavor - changing processes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exists a built - in `` gim '' mechanism suppressing induced flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , a result of the near - universality of the couplings between the sm fermions and excited kaluza - klein ( kk ) gauge modes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , by the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , these extra - dimensional models provide a weakly - coupled holographic description of nontrivial strong gauge dynamics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and flavor physics ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "a basic feature of warped phenomenological models is the existence of an ir brane at which the warped dimension abruptly ends .",
    "this breaks the conformal symmetry , generating four - dimensional ( 4d ) particle states with a kk / composite mass spectrum @xmath3 .",
    "but this hard - wall representation of the ir brane represents just one way to break conformal symmetry .",
    "instead a more general approach is to replace the ir brane with a so - called soft wall , in which conformal symmetry is smoothly broken by a dilaton field , providing a dynamical cutoff to spacetime along the fifth dimension .",
    "this allows for a variety of kk mass spectra to be generated and , since there is no longer an ir brane , forces all ir brane fields to be five - dimensional ( 5d ) bulk fields .",
    "thus , from the dual holographic description , any operator of finite dimension responsible for conformal ( or other ) symmetry breaking can be modeled in the soft - wall background .",
    "the soft - wall warped dimension was first proposed to model the regge behavior of highly excited mesons in ads / qcd models  @xcite . in analogy with this qcd application ,",
    "the soft wall can be used to model the possible underlying dynamics of electroweak physics . since this dynamics is unknown , a much larger set of possibilities can be studied for electroweak physics , leading to a variety of qualitatively distinct phenomenology .",
    "in particular , an application of the soft - wall warped dimension to electroweak breaking in gauge - higgs unification models leads to less severe constraints from electroweak precision tests , allowing for kk gauge modes generically as light as 2 tev or less  @xcite .    in this work we will study the standard model in a soft - wall warped dimension as a way to model the possible underlying dynamics of electroweak physics . a concrete 5d gravity model , similar to the dynamical ads / qcd model of ref .",
    "@xcite , is presented which provides a starting point to address the hierarchy problem and stability .",
    "although our model does have a built - in stabilization mechanism due to a particular choice of uv boundary conditions , a large hierarchy between the uv and ir scales can only be obtained by a significant amount of tuning .",
    "nevertheless , different boundary conditions can be chosen which leave the ir scale undetermined , corresponding to a modulus field .",
    "thus , new mechanisms may still be developed which solve the hierarchy problem in the soft - wall framework .",
    "with these caveats aside we study bulk gauge fields and fermions in the soft - wall warped dimension .",
    "even though the fifth dimension is infinite , the kk spectrum can be discrete , with a variety of spacing between resonances including linear regge - like behavior .",
    "the analysis of bulk fermions is particularly involved compared to the usual hard - wall setup .",
    "specifically , it is necessary to go beyond the zero - mode approximation and fully account for the 5d yukawa interactions that generate position - dependent fermion mass terms .",
    "the general problem with three generations requires a detailed numerical analysis , which we do not address in this paper .",
    "instead , we illustrate in a simple single - generation model that many of the nice features of hard - wall models , such as fermion localization , mass hierarchies , and universal kk gauge couplings , occur in the soft - wall warped dimension .",
    "finally , we construct electroweak models with custodial symmetry .",
    "we discuss the dynamics leading to an ir peaked bulk higgs condensate responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry .",
    "moreover , we find that electroweak constraints are not as stringent as their hard - wall counterparts , accommodating kk modes with masses of order the tev scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss some of the general features of the soft - wall warped dimension .",
    "a dynamical 5d gravity model is then presented which provides a concrete realization of the soft - wall framework , and issues related to the separation of the uv and ir scales are discussed .",
    "we study bulk gauge fields and fermions in sec .  3 , fully accounting for the effect of the backreaction of the higgs condensate on the fermion dynamics . in sec .",
    "4 we consider custodial electroweak models , studying the higgs sector and electroweak constraints .",
    "directions for future work and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the basic feature which distinguishes the soft - wall warped dimension from the usual hard wall slice of ads is the replacement of the ir brane with a smooth spacetime cutoff .",
    "the metric describing 5d spacetime in the conformal coordinate @xmath4 can be written as @xmath5 we will work with a pure ads metric , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ads curvature scale and @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast to hard - wall models , the coordinate @xmath4 extends to infinity .",
    "the action describing the gauge and matter fields is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the matter field lagrangian , and @xmath11 is the `` dilaton '' .",
    "although we are taking a phenomenological approach , we have in mind that @xmath11 is to be identified with the string theory dilaton and the action ( [ matteraction ] ) may originate from some particular d - brane construction .",
    "the dilaton obtains a nontrivial background value @xmath12 , providing a dynamical cutoff to spacetime and obviating the need for an ir brane . in the holographic picture ,",
    "@xmath11 is responsible for the confining dynamics at infrared energy scales .",
    "indeed , we can identify an effective running coupling @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the number of colors in the dual theory , which grows in the ir .",
    "correspondingly , sources located at large @xmath4 will be strongly coupled , and processes involving exchange of ir localized bulk kk modes can become nonperturbative at high energies @xcite .",
    "however , for uv localized matter , as in the electroweak models that we will present , the effective description will remain perturbative sufficiently far into the infrared region .",
    "though there are many possible behaviors for the dilaton , we will only consider power - law behavior @xmath15 .",
    "in general the eigenfunctions of bulk fields with a power - law dilaton satisfy an analog 1d `` schrdinger '' equation with a power - law potential .",
    "a simple wkb approximation then shows that for large mode number @xmath16 the kk mass spectrum follows @xmath17 even though the conformal coordinate @xmath4 extends to infinity , for @xmath18 we obtain a discrete mass spectrum . in particular , for the case",
    "@xmath19 the spectrum exhibits linear `` regge '' behavior .",
    "later we will specialize to this case as it allows for analytic results .",
    "as @xmath20 we recover the usual hard - wall mass spectrum @xmath3 .",
    "the dilaton power - law exponent , @xmath21 , therefore provides a continuous parameter in which the kk mass spectrum varies from a continuum to that associated with a compact extra dimension .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , there are other interesting but qualitatively distinct behaviors possible if @xmath22 . for example",
    ", a constant dilaton @xcite leads to `` unparticles '' @xcite from a 4d perspective , while `` hidden valley '' models @xcite are obtained when @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "though an ir brane is no longer needed , a uv boundary at small @xmath4 is still required in order to obtain the zero modes identified with the sm fields , which otherwise would not be normalizable .",
    "this also follows from holography , because typically the zero modes are ( primarily ) elementary fields associated with `` sources '' on the uv brane , rather than composites emerging from the dual gauge theory . as in hard - wall models",
    ", the uv brane will be located at a position @xmath24 .",
    "note that there is an alternative way to model the soft wall , which relies on having an exponentially decaying metric @xcite . for many cases ,",
    "the equations of motion are the same whether one uses a dilaton or the decaying metric , but differences can arise , in particular for bulk fermions and massive bosonic fields .",
    "we find in most cases that it is technically simpler to use a running dilaton as the soft wall with a pure ads metric .",
    "though it is possible to study certain aspects of soft - wall phenomenology from a purely bottom - up approach , a number of important questions can not be addressed without reference to an underlying gravity theory .",
    "a dynamical gravitational model is required , for example , to address issues regarding generation of hierarchies and stability . in this section",
    "we present a dynamical 5d gravitational model which leads to a soft - wall warped dimension .",
    "the model is the same as that in ref .",
    "@xcite with modifications to accommodate a uv boundary .",
    "consider the einstein frame action describing gravity and two scalar fields , the `` dilaton '' @xmath25 and the `` tachyon '' @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the 5d planck scale .",
    "the bulk action contains a scalar potential @xmath29 , while the uv boundary located at @xmath30 is characterized by the induced metric @xmath31 and boundary potential @xmath32 .    the solutions to ( [ aef ] ) are most easily obtained through the introduction of a `` superpotential '' @xmath33 , which converts the system into a set of first - order differential equations  @xcite . using this procedure ,",

    ", there should exist a massless radion associated with this modulus .",
    "however , we will see next that the uv boundary potential can in fact stabilize @xmath42 , and we therefore expect that the radion becomes massive .",
    "a complete answer to this question can only be obtained by analyzing the fluctuations of the background solutions , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "interestingly , the hierarchy @xmath50 can be naturally generated for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , but this does not give rise to a discrete kk particle spectrum .",
    "nevertheless this deserves further study .",
    "while the boundary action ( [ bpot0 ] ) fails to naturally generate a large hierarchy between @xmath7 and @xmath42 , an alternative way to satisfy the boundary conditions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 is to let @xmath53 the boundary conditions following from the variational principle do not then fix the ir scale @xmath42 . with this assumption",
    "other stabilization mechanisms can then be explored .",
    "for example , we might consider an additional scalar field @xmath54 , as in the goldberger - wise mechanism  @xcite , with a small amplitude so that the backreaction on the metric can be neglected . if the field has a profile @xmath55 , and boundary condition analogous to those in ( [ bcphi ] ) and ( [ bct ] ) , this would suggest @xmath56 .",
    "a large hierarchy between @xmath7 and @xmath42 would be obtained if @xmath57 .",
    "it would be interesting to look at the dynamics leading to this profile for @xmath54 and determine if the backreaction on the dilaton and metric can be made small .",
    "although our main application of the soft - wall background will be to model electroweak physics , one can ask whether ordinary 4d gravity can be incorporated naturally into our model .",
    "the 4d planck mass is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the incomplete gamma function , and we have used @xmath60 and assumed @xmath61 in the last step .",
    "we can see that there is a problem because we would like to have @xmath62 tev to model electroweak physics",

    "if we take as usual @xmath64 , then according to ( [ mplanck ] ) we can not account for the weakness of gravity .    with these considerations ,",
    "there are two possible cases for the uv scale @xmath65 : ( i ) @xmath66 , i.e. there is no large hierarchy and we project out the zero - mode graviton with dirichlet conditions ( for concreteness we will take @xmath67 as in @xcite ) ; ( ii ) @xmath68 , i.e. we assume a suitable stabilization mechanism may be found and apply neumann conditions to allow a massless graviton .",

    "the kk modes follow approximate linear trajectories : @xmath94 the approximate mass formula ( [ gravspect ] ) is valid for both neumann and dirichlet conditions .",

    "unlike in hard - wall models with an ir brane , the higgs boson in a soft - wall background must necessarily propagate in the bulk . since the higgs profile should be peaked in the ir ( to be dual to a composite electroweak symmetry breaking sector ) , the backreaction of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) on the bulk fermion equations of motion at large @xmath4 can not be neglected .",
    "the correct way to proceed is to diagonalize the bulk equations of motion and obtain the sm fermion masses from the boundary conditions .",
    "this is different from the usual case in which fermions are analyzed using the zero - mode approximation , treating yukawa interactions as perturbations and obtaining fermion masses from wavefunction overlap integrals  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we show in appendix  [ appferm ] that the fermion zero - mode approximation in the soft - wall warped dimension has problems with strong coupling and normalizability .",
    "we therefore endeavor to fully account for the higgs feedback on the fermion equations of motion .",
    "as we will see , the general analysis for three fermion generations is quite involved and requires a numerical approach that is beyond the scope of the present work to determine the mass eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",

    "this simple model allows for an analytical determination of masses and eigenfunctions and illustrates how in principle the general analysis can be done .",
    "more importantly , we show that some of the nice features of bulk fermions in hard - wall models , such as mass hierarchies and universal kk gauge couplings , which usually lead to the `` gim '' mechanism , are also present in our single generation model .",

    "for instance , it is still an open question whether the hierarchy problem can be solved in the soft - wall warped dimension with @xmath18 . within our 5d gravity model , a particular set of uv boundary conditions fixes the ir scale @xmath42 , but we were able to show that a large hierarchy between the curvature scale @xmath7 and the ir scale @xmath42 could not be obtained naturally .",

    "it would be interesting to perform a detailed scalar fluctuation analysis of our solution and check whether introducing a goldberger - wise field could lead to a naturally large hierarchy between @xmath7 and @xmath42 .",
    "leaving aside the gravitational issues we then considered the properties of bulk fields in the soft - wall background .",
    "both the zero - mode graviton and gauge fields have constant profiles and therefore become uv localized with respect to a flat metric .",
    "even though the warped dimension is infinite we showed that there exists a normalizable and discrete kk spectrum .",

    "in particular , for bulk gravitons and gauge fields a linear regge - like spectrum ( as in qcd ) can be obtained .",
    "on the other hand the phenomenology of bulk fermions was not so straightforward . in the soft - wall framework",
    "a bulk higgs condensate leads to @xmath4-dependent fermion masses , which grow in the ir .",
    "thus , the bulk yukawa interaction can not be treated as a perturbation and the full backreaction must be taken into account .",

    "these results warrant the continued investigation of a complete soft - wall analog of the usual hard - wall flavor models .",
    "our simple soft - wall background setup also allowed the higgs dynamics to be analyzed .",
    "we were able to show that the specific bulk higgs condensate leading to fermion localization is a vacuum state of the theory and a linearized fluctuation analysis confirmed that there are no tachyonic modes .",
    "interestingly the form of the bulk higgs mass required to obtained the specific @xmath4-dependent fermion mass term follows from a coupling @xmath323 , suggesting that the  tachyon \" scalar field @xmath26 plays a crucial role in generating fermion masses .",
    "the specific form of the bulk higgs condensate was then used to analyze an electroweak model with custodial symmetry and uv - localized fermions .",

    "most of the results obtained concerning bulk fields and electroweak physics focused on the case where the dilaton exponent @xmath19 , corresponding to linear trajectories for the kk states .",
    "this case is analytically tractable , but we see no issue with numerically analyzing other values of @xmath21 . for example , when @xmath324 the ratio @xmath325 can be made naturally small and this would be an interesting case to explore .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "2 , there is a strong coupling issue because the effective 5d coupling grows in the ir .",
    "the effective description therefore remains valid up to some large @xmath4 cutoff which can be made arbitrarily large for @xmath326 in the dual theory .",
    "in fact , the extra dimension could be truncated at some large @xmath4 i.e. have both a hard and soft wall .",
    "as long as the hard wall is located sufficiently far into the extra dimension many of the phenomenological features of the soft wall will be preserved .",
    "for example , the lowest lying resonances can still have exotic power - law mass trajectories that would eventually transition to the usual hard - wall spectrum .",
    "it would therefore be worth studying such a setup with both a running dilaton and a ir brane .",
    "finally , the detailed collider phenomenology of the soft - wall standard model relevant for the lhc remains to be done .",
    "in particular , with the kk scale being somewhat lower than in hard - wall models as well as the couplings between sm fermions and the resonances being somewhat weaker , the phenomenology could be qualitatively distinct from that in hard - wall models .",
