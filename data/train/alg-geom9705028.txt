    "one of the most intriguing conjectures in complex analytic geometry is the speculation  essentially due to herb clemens , with refinements by miles reid and others  that the moduli spaces of all nonsingular compact complex threefolds with trivial canonical bundle might possibly be connected into a single family .",
    "clemens introduced a transition process among the moduli spaces of these various threefolds in which the complex structure on one such threefold is allowed to acquire singularities , and those singularities are then resolved by means of a bimeromorphic map from a second such threefold .",
    "if the threefolds involved have compatible khler metrics ( which therefore determine `` calabi  yau structures '' ) , then the second step in this process can be viewed as a sort of inverse to allowing the khler metric on the nonsingular model to degenerate to some kind of `` khler metric with singularities , '' the singularities being concentrated on the exceptional set of the resolution map .",
    "it is natural to wonder how this process might be related to the string - theoretic phenomenon known as `` mirror symmetry ''",
    "@xcite , which predicts that the moduli space of complex structures on one calabi ",
    "yau threefold @xmath0 should in many cases be locally isomorphic to the space of ( complexified ) khler structures on a `` mirror partner '' @xmath1 of @xmath0 , and _",
    "vice versa_. viewed through the `` looking glass '' of mirror symmetry , the two ways of approaching the singular space in clemens transition appear complementary ",
    "one involves a specialization of complex structure parameters , the other involves a specialization of khler parameters  and indeed their rles should be reversed when passing to mirror partners .",
    "the thesis of this lecture is that the whenever such a transition exists , it ought to enable us to predict the mirror partner of one of the calabi ",
    "yau manifolds involved in the transition from a knowledge of the mirror partner of the other .",
    "we will explain this idea in general terms , give some evidence and examples , and then formulate a specific conjecture which implements it .",
    "after this lecture was delivered , there were a number of new developments in string theory related to this construction ; we describe those briefly at the end .",
    "use of the term `` calabi  yau '' varies ; our conventions are as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact , connected , oriented manifold of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "a _ calabi ",
    "yau metric _ on @xmath0 is a riemannian metric whose ( global ) holonomy is a subgroup of @xmath3 .",
    "a _ calabi  yau structure _ on @xmath0 is a choice of complex structure with trivial canonical bundle together with a khler metric ; each calabi  yau structure determines a unique calabi ",
    "yau metric according to yau s solution @xcite of the calabi conjecture @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath0 is a _ calabi ",
    "yau manifold _ if it admits calabi  yau structures ( and hence calabi  yau metrics ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "the simplest way to specify a family of calabi  yau structures on @xmath0 is by means of a proper smooth holomorphic map @xmath4 satisfying @xmath5 whose fibers @xmath6 are diffeomorphic to @xmath0 , together with a fixed khler metric on the total space @xmath7 , or more generally , a family of khler metrics depending on parameters",
    ". we can allow the complex structures to acquire singularities by enlarging the family to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an open subset whose complement is closed , and where @xmath10 is still assumed to be a proper holomorphic map such that @xmath11 , but is no longer assumed to be smooth .",
    "the fibers @xmath12 for @xmath13 may then be complex analytic spaces with singularities ; of course , such spaces do not have khler metrics _ per se_.",
    "suppose that the singularities of the fibers @xmath14 can be simultaneously resolved for @xmath15 by manifolds with calabi  yau structures .",
    "that is , suppose that there exists a manifold @xmath16 , a family of complex structures @xmath17 on @xmath18 such that @xmath19 whose total space @xmath20 is a khler manifold , and a proper bimeromorphic map @xmath21 which commutes with projection to @xmath22 .",
    "( in general , it will be necessary to shrink @xmath23 before this simultaneous resolution is possible  if it is possible at all . )",
    "if in addition , the bimeromorphic map @xmath24 is an _",
    "extremal contraction _ in the sense of mori theory ( which means that for every algebraic curve @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 if and only if the class of @xmath27 lies in some fixed face @xmath28 of the mori cone of @xmath29 ) , then we say that @xmath0 and @xmath18 are related by an _",
    "transition_.    we can also describe an extremal transition `` in reverse , '' starting with @xmath18 . in this version of the definition",
    ", we should begin with a family @xmath30 of complex structures on @xmath18 whose total space is a khler manifold , fix a birational extremal contraction @xmath31 ( which is determined simply by the choice of an appropriate face @xmath28 of the mori cone ) , and ask for a smoothing of the contracted spaces .",
    "that is , we look for a space @xmath23 into which @xmath22 can be embedded as a closed subset , and a family @xmath32 such that @xmath33 is smooth for @xmath34 ( and diffeomorphic to @xmath0 ) whereas @xmath35 is the same family of singular spaces as before .",
    "if this smoothing exists , then @xmath0 and @xmath18 are related by an extremal transition as above .",
    "this `` reverse '' description can actually be thought of as varying the khler parameters , rather than the complex structure parameters .",
    "consider a family of khler metrics on the total space @xmath18 whose cohomology class approaches a point on the dual @xmath36 of the face @xmath28 .",
    "metrically , the curves @xmath27 lying in that face will approach zero area in such a process , and so the space with metric included `` approaches '' the contracted space @xmath37 .    in string theory",
    ", the choice of khler class serves as an important parameter in the theory .",
    "in fact , a more natural parameter for string theory is a complexification of the khler class , varying throughout an open subset of the _ complexified khler moduli space _ @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the _ complexified khler cone _ , and @xmath40 is the group of holomorphic automorphisms . the face @xmath28 of the mori cone corresponding to an extremal contraction determines a boundary `` wall '' @xmath41 of the complexified khler cone , and  provided that the singularities of @xmath42 are sufficiently mild  the intersection @xmath43 will coincide with @xmath44 for generic nearby @xmath45 .",
    "if the automorphism groups are reasonably well - behaved , there is then a natural inclusion @xmath46 ( using the partial compactifications described in @xcite ) .",
    "_ mirror symmetry _ refers to a phenomenon in string theory in which certain pairs of calabi  yau manifolds produce isomorphic physical theories , in such a way that the complexified khler moduli space of the first calabi  yau manifold is mapped to the ordinary ( complex structure ) moduli space of the second and _ vice versa _ , establishing local isomorphisms between those moduli spaces .",
    "our basic proposal is that the mirror of an extremal transition should be another such transition , from a smooth space @xmath1 specializing to a singular space @xmath47 ( using the complex structure ) which has a resolution of singularities @xmath48 . in this mirror version , _",
    "the mirror partner of @xmath0 should be @xmath48 , while the mirror partner of @xmath18 should be @xmath1_. under the mirror map , the inclusion @xmath49 between compactified parameter spaces for complex structures on @xmath18 and @xmath0 should locally map to the inclusion @xmath50 ( and similarly for complex structures on @xmath48 and @xmath1 mapping to khler structures on @xmath0 and @xmath18 ) . in particular , if we know the mirror partner of @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) , and if we can predict where in the moduli space the mirror of the extremal transition should occur , then we should be able to determine the mirror partner of @xmath18 ( resp .",
    "@xmath0 ) .",
    "we will make this proposal more precise in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "in addition to the formal analogy between khler and complex structures which led to our `` looking glass '' interpretation of the mirror of an extremal transition , we were motivated by a computation of the effect on cohomology of the simplest type of extremal transition which has been known since the work of clemens .",
    "( see @xcite for general versions of this computation ) .",
    "suppose that the complex dimension of our calabi ",
    "yau manifolds is three , and suppose that all singularities of @xmath51 are ordinary double points .",
    "( in this case , we will follow the conventions of the physics literature @xcite and refer to the extremal transition as a _ conifold transition .",
    "_ ) generally , we might expect that acquiring a double point places one condition on moduli .",
    "however , the double points may fail to impose independent conditions .",
    "clemens computation relates the failure of double points to impose independent conditions on the moduli of @xmath0 to the relative picard number of the small resolution @xmath18 , in the following way : if there are @xmath52 double points which only impose @xmath53 conditions on moduli then    \\(i ) @xmath54 is a subspace of codimension @xmath55 ( the inclusion comes from the identification of @xmath56 with the space of invariant cycles ) , and    \\(ii ) @xmath57 is a subspace of codimension @xmath58 ( the inclusion is induced by pullbacks of divisors ) .    in other words ,",
    "each failure to impose a condition on moduli leads to an extra class in @xmath59 .",
    "one of the properties of mirror symmetry for threefolds is that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are exchanged when passing to a mirror partner .",
    "thus , if mirror partners @xmath48 and @xmath1 are known for @xmath0 and @xmath18 , respectively , then by using these mirror isomorphisms of cohomology we find that    \\(i ) @xmath62 has codimension @xmath55 , and    \\(ii ) @xmath63 has codimension @xmath58 .",
    "it then seems very natural to conjecture that @xmath1 and @xmath48 should be related by a conifold transition in the opposite direction : it should be possible to allow the complex structure on @xmath1 to acquire @xmath52 ordinary double points which this time impose only @xmath64 conditions on moduli , such that the singular spaces obtained can be resolved by @xmath48 .",
    "this would be a special case of our general principle relating mirror symmetry to extremal transitions .",
    "one context in which certain extremal transitions have a very explicit realization is the case of calabi  yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties .",
    "@xmath65-dimensional toric variety _",
    "@xmath66 is a @xmath67-equivariant compactification of the algebraic torus @xmath68 ( often specified by the combinatorial data encoded in a _ fan _ ) . to describe a hypersurface within such a variety",
    "we need a polynomial  the defining equation  whose constituent monomials can be thought of as @xmath69-valued characters @xmath70 .",
    "batyrev @xcite has given an elegant condition which characterizes when such a hypersurface will be calabi ",
    ". the condition is stated in terms of the _ newton polyhedron _ of the polynomial , which is the polyhedron spanned by the monomials appearing in the equation .",
    "that is , if the polynomial is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the lattice of characters on @xmath67 , then the newton polyhedron is the convex hull @xmath73 batyrev s criterion says that the generic such hypersurface is calabi  yau it is always possible to choose the fan in such a way that the generic such hypersurface is nonsingular , and we can then speak of calabi  yau _ manifolds _ in this context . ] if @xmath74 is _ reflexive _ , which means that ( 1 ) @xmath74 is the convex hull of the lattice points it contains , ( 2 ) there is a unique lattice point @xmath75 in the interior of @xmath74 , and ( 3 ) the polar polyhedron ( with respect to @xmath75 ) defined by @xmath76 has its vertices at lattice points of the dual lattice @xmath77 .",
    "conversely , given a reflexive polyhedron @xmath74 , there is an associated family of calabi  yau hypersurfaces with defining equation @xmath78 embedded in a toric variety @xmath79 determined by some fan whose one - dimensional cones are the rays @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "( the toric variety @xmath79 is not uniquely specified by this , since we need to choose the fan , not just the one - dimensional cones ; however , @xmath82 is independent of the choice of fan . )",
    "there is a simple class of _ toric extremal transitions _ which can be described in these terms .",
    "suppose we have two reflexive polyhedra @xmath83 .",
    "since all monomials appearing in @xmath84 also appear in @xmath85 , we can regard the hypersurfaces @xmath86 associated to @xmath87 as being limits of the hypersurfaces @xmath88 associated to @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , they will have worse than generic singularities when embedded in the toric variety @xmath79 , but those singularities can be improved , or in some cases ( including the case @xmath89 ) fully resolved , by further triangulation .",
    "in fact , the unique interior point @xmath75 of @xmath87 must also be the unique interior point of @xmath74 , which implies that @xmath90 starting with a triangulation of @xmath91 , we will be able to further triangulate by including vertices of @xmath92 .",
    "this construction provides an extremal transition as defined above , when the spaces involved are nonsingular ( as is the case when @xmath89 ) : the family of complex structures acquires canonical singularities when certain coefficients in the defining equation are set to zero , and those singularities can be simultaneously resolved by maps which are extremal contractions .",
    "more precisely , the complex structures on the calabi ",
    "yau manifold @xmath93 have a natural parameter space @xmath94 which is an open subset of @xmath95 ( the notation indicates a quotient in the sense of geometric invariant theory . )",
    "one of the subsets of @xmath23 along which the calabi  yau spaces approach a singular space @xmath96 is the set @xmath97 in which all coefficients @xmath98 in eq .   with @xmath99",
    "have been set to zero .",
    "this is where our extremal transition is located .",
    "refining a triangulation of @xmath91 to a triangulation of @xmath100 produces the resolution of singularities @xmath101 .",
    "in addition to giving a criterion for when a toric hypersurface is calabi  yau , batyrev made a simple and beautiful conjecture concerning a possible mirror partner for any such hypersurface . to find the mirror family for @xmath93 , batyrev s conjecture states that we should simply use the polar polyhedron @xmath91 to determine a new family of hypersurfaces ",
    "let s call it @xmath102 .",
    "batyrev s construction exhibits a perfect compatibility with toric extremal transitions : since @xmath103 , we _ automatically _ get an extremal transition between @xmath104 and @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , batyrev s formula @xcite for the hodge numbers of these hypersurfaces shows that  as in the case of our conifold transition conjecture  mirror symmetry is compatible with extremal transitions in the manner stated .",
    "in fact , using a description of the khler cones of @xmath104 and @xmath102 in terms of @xmath87 and @xmath74 , together with an extension of batyrev s conjecture known as the `` monomial - divisor mirror map '' @xcite , one can verify that the inclusion @xmath105 between the spaces from eqs .   and",

    "we have limited our discussion to neighborhoods of large complex structure limit points , which are the mirrors of khler cones ( of various birational models of @xmath48 ) .",
    "it is frequently possible to analytically continue the complexified khler moduli space beyond these khler cones @xcite , but we do nt know good criteria for deciding about the existence of extremal transitions ( on the `` khler moduli '' side ) in such regions of the moduli space .",
    "extremal transitions in such regions , if they exist , would evade detection in the sort of analysis given here .",
    "in the physics literature , conifold transitions were first observed in a process known as `` splitting '' which related various families of complete intersection calabi ",
    "yau threefolds @xcite .",
    "considerable effort was expended in showing that all then - known examples of calabi  yau threefolds could be connected into a single web @xcite , and it was also observed that these connections occurred at finite distance in the moduli space ( with respect to the natural `` zamolodchikov '' metric on that space ) @xcite .",
    "however , a physical mechanism implementing these transitions was unknown .",
    "some months after this lecture was delivered , a new mechanism was proposed in the physics literature for realizing an extremal transition as a physical process in type ii string theory @xcite .",
    "the mechanism in its original form only applies to conifold transitions , but there are now indications @xcite that similar mechanisms will enable all extremal transitions to be realized in physics .",
    "motivated by this , the subpolyhedron construction described in section [ subsec:32 ] was subsequently used @xcite to show that all calabi  yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces can be linked by extremal transitions .    in another direction  perhaps closer in spirit to the original approach of clemens and reid ",
    "kontsevich @xcite has made a fascinating construction involving lagrangian analytic cones in an infinite - dimensional space , and has conjectured a mirror symmetry relationship in terms of these cones which would involve _ all _ symplectic complex threefolds with trivial canonical bundle ( even those for which the symplectic structure does not arise from a khler structure ) .",
    "finally , there was been a recent geometric reformulation of the basic mirror symmetry property in physics @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in terms of fibrations of a calabi ",
    "yau manifold by special lagrangian tori .",
    "it is an important and challenging problem to understand how such fibrations behave under an extremal transition .",
    "such an understanding could ultimately lead to a proof of the conjecture in section [ sec:4 ] using the new `` geometric '' definition of mirror symmetry .",
    "i am grateful to mark gross for insisting that the analysis given here should not be limited to the case of small resolutions , and for discussions on other points .",
