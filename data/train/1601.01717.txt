    "it is generally assumed that in much of the interstellar medium ( ism ) emission emanating from atomic and molecular transitions within a radiating gas happen independently for each atom or molecule . from intensity measurements of such spectral lines ,",
    "important parameters ( e.g. , density and temperature ) can be determined and the physical conditions in a given * * environment thus characterized * * @xcite .",
    "for example , in cases where the spectral lines are optically thin the intensity will be found to scale linearly with the number of atoms or molecules responsible for the detected radiation .",
    "the soundness of this approach rests mostly on the assumption that spontaneous emission from different atoms or molecules happens independently .",
    "as was pointed out by r. h. dicke in a seminal paper several decades ago @xcite , the assumption of independent spontaneous emission for the components of a gas does not apply in all conditions . as will be discussed in this paper , and following dicke s original analysis",
    ", closely packed atoms can interact with their common electromagnetic field and radiate coherently .",
    "that is , the spontaneous emission of atoms or molecules in such a gas will not be independent , but rather take place in a cooperative manner . in the ideal case , this phenomenon will lead to a much more intense and focussed radiation ( proportional to the square of the number of atoms ) , which dicke called superradiance . since dicke s original proposal , the field of superradiance research has flourished and an abundant literature has developed within the physics community .",
    "the first experimental detection of superradiance in the laboratory was achieved by @xcite , while several other independent verifications @xcite have since been realized under a large domain of conditions and experimental setups ( see chap . 2 of @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "while the reality of the superradiance phenomenon has long been clearly established in the laboratory , to the best of our knowledge , it has yet to be investigated within an astrophysical context .",
    "it appears to us important to do so since some of the requirements and conditions needed for the realization of a superradiant system are known to be satisfied in some regions of the ism .",
    "more precisely , superradiance can arise in systems where there is a population inversion , and the effect will be much stronger and more likely to be realized when atoms or molecules are separated by approximately less than the wavelength of radiation ( see below and section [ sub : large - n - atom - sample ] ) .    the population inversion condition is known to occur in the ism and is partly responsible for the ubiquitous presence of masers ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "but it is also important to realize that , although it is a necessary condition , population inversion is not by itself sufficient to ensure superradiance .",
    "it is also required that there exists sufficient velocity coherence between the atoms partaking in the effect , and that any other dephasing takes place on time - scales longer than those characterizing superradiance . when all these conditions are met a coherent behavior can be established between the atoms and superradiance can ensue .",
    "we note , however , that , as will be discussed later on , superradiance is unlikely to could take place in thermally relaxed regions of the ism .",
    "this is because doppler broadening resulting from , say , a maxwellian velocity distribution would leave too few atoms with the required velocity coherence to allow superradiance to develop .",
    "our analysis will therefore imply other types of environments where thermal equilibrium has not been reached . for example , any region in the ism into which a significant amount of energy is being suddenly released ( e.g. , shocks or regions where significant radiation flares occur ) will be strongly out of equilibrium , and provide conditions that are potentially markedly different to those found in a thermal gas and may meet the requirements for superradiance . also , although superradiance can also occur for large interatomic or molecular separations ( i.e. , greater than the wavelength of radiation ; see section [ sub : two - atom - large ] ) , the aforementioned constraint of small interatomic or molecular separation , and its implication for the corresponding densities , is likely to be met for only a limited number of spectral lines , but a few astrophysically important transitions are suitable candidates .",
    "one of these spectral lines is the 21 cm atomic hydrogen transition .    even though a 21 cm maser has yet to be discovered , which would also imply the realization of a population inversion for this spectral line , as will be seen through our analysis the length - scales required for superradiance at 21 cm are very small compared to those that would be needed for maser amplification in the ism ( @xcite , and see below ) .",
    "it follows that although the lack of observational evidence of masers for this transition significantly affects the probability of detecting superradiance , it does not rule it out .",
    "also , the existence of higher densities of atomic hydrogen in some parts of the ism would increase the potential detectability of superradiance , if the other necessary conditions for its realization previously listed were also met .",
    "furthermore , with the recent discoveries of radio bursts at frequencies close to 1400 mhz @xcite the investigation of the properties of a transient phenomenon such as superradiance is timely .",
    "this is why in this first paper on the subject we chose to introduce the concept of superradiance to the ism using this spectral line .    whether or not a population inversion can easily be realized for the energy levels leading to the 21 cm line , it has been considered in the existing literature @xcite and we know of at least one region ( the orion veil ) where the kinetic temperature is lower than the 21-cm spin temperature , providing evidence for a population inversion @xcite .",
    "the main pumping process covered in the literature corresponds to the situation when a hi gas is close to a source of radiation that emits a field with an intensity @xmath0 in the neighborhood of the lyman @xmath1 line .",
    "a hydrogen atom in the ground hyperfine state ( @xmath2 ) can absorb a photon and become excited to the @xmath3 level .",
    "later on , the atom returns to the upper hyperfine state ( @xmath4 ) emitting a slightly less energetic photon than the initial one absorbed by the atom .",
    "the same can happen for a hydrogen atom initially in the hyperfine state ( @xmath4 ) that returns to the ground ( @xmath2 ) state after excitation to the @xmath3 level , emitting a slightly more energetic photon in the process .",
    "the absorption rate of the photons for both cases depends on the intensity of the radiation @xmath0 , but the return ( emission ) process does not .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5 level will undergo more absorptions followed by a return to the ( @xmath4 ) level whenever @xmath0 harbors more blue than red photons , and will become accordingly less populated than the @xmath6 level @xcite . although @xcite concluded that it is unlikely to maintain a population inversion over an extended region needed for the maser amplification with this process , they also pointed out that an `` appreciable '' inversion can thus be realized over a region of thickness @xmath7 pc .",
    "given the above inversion scenario , we would expect that environments located in the periphery or near boundaries of hii regions could provide conditions suitable for the development of superradiance , for example .",
    "the aforementioned evidence for a 21 cm population inversion in the orion veil brings support to this idea .",
    "whatever the case , the 21 cm line will serve us as a starting point for the development of the superradiance formalism for the ism ( in the present case for a magnetic dipolar transition ) , which will then be refined in the future and also applied to other ( electric dipolar ) spectral lines ( e.g. , the oh 1612-mhz , ch@xmath8oh 6.7-ghz , and h@xmath9o 22-ghz maser transitions ) where observational evidence for superradiance can be found in the literature @xcite .    it should also be pointed out that superradiance is a fundamentally different phenomenon from the maser action , even though the two may seem similar at first glance .",
    "an astronomical maser is a collective but not coherent phenomenon .",
    "more precisely , for a maser a group of atoms , initially in their excited states , emit through the stimulated emission process but can not be considered as a single quantum system .",
    "that is , it is possible to describe maser action through successive events where an excited atom is stimulated by the incident radiation and emits a photon , with the same stimulation / emission processes subsequently repeated for different atoms in the masing sample . on the other hand for superradiance",
    ", coherence emphasizes the fact that the group of atoms interacting with the radiation field behaves like a single quantum system @xcite .",
    "that is , the superradiance emission process can not be broken down into successive events as is the case of maser radiation . finally , superradiance is a transient effect in which a strong directional pulse is radiated over a relatively short time - scale , while maser action operates more in a steady state regime as long as population inversion is maintained .",
    "the material covered in this paper goes as follows , we start with a general discussion of the concept of superradiance for the so - called small- and large - samples , as originally discussed by @xcite , in section [ sec : superradiance ] . in section [ sec : the - two - level - h - sample ] , we examine the possibility of building cooperative behavior in a hi sample based on a comparative analysis of time - scales for the 21 cm line in a hi gas , as well as present corresponding numerical results .",
    "a discussion and short conclusion follow in sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] , respectively , while the superradiance formalism and detailed derivations for the material discussed in the main sections of the paper will be found in appendices at the end .",
    "dicke originally proposed in 1954 a model where an ensemble of @xmath10 initially inverted two - level atoms interacting with their common radiation field is considered as a single quantum mechanical system @xcite . in his model ,",
    "a two - level atom is modeled as a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field where the spin up configuration corresponds to the excited state @xmath11 and the spin down to the ground state @xmath12 . just as an ensemble of @xmath10 spin-1/2 particles can be described using two quantum numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the eigenstates of the combined @xmath10 two - level atoms in dicke s model can also be labelled with two quantum numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where    @xmath19    with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the number of particles in the excited and ground states , respectively . from the complete set of eigenstates characterizing this quantum mechanical system , those symmetrical under the permutation of any pair of atoms are particularly important and are called dicke states .",
    "the initial state @xmath22 of @xmath10 fully inverted spin-1/2 particles corresponding to @xmath10 fully inverted two - level atoms is one such dicke state , and is identified by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "when an atom in the ensemble decays to its ground state by emitting a photon , the quantum number @xmath16 is decreased by one while @xmath15 remains unchanged and the system moves to another symmetric state .",
    "dicke showed that the radiation intensity from such an ensemble cascading from the initial ( @xmath25 ) state down through an arbitrary state ( @xmath26 ) is    @xmath27    if the volume containing the ensemble of @xmath10 two - level atoms is much smaller than @xmath28 , the cube of the wavelength of the radiation interacting with the atoms . in equation ( [ eq : i_dicke ] ) ,",
    "@xmath29 is the radiation intensity due to spontaneous emission from a single two - level atom .",
    "this particular type of system and density condition defines a _ small - sample_. this cascading process is depicted in figure [ fig : cascade ] .    furthermore , dicke pointed out that in the ( @xmath23 , @xmath30 ) state , where the half of the atoms are in the ground state and the other half in the excited state , the radiation intensity of the system is maximum at    @xmath31    implying a significantly enhanced radiation beam , a phenomenon he named _",
    "superradiance_. this can be understood by the fact that when the distance between neighboring atoms is much smaller than the wavelength of radiation , the photon emitted by one atom is seen to be in phase by neighboring atoms and can bring about the emission of a new photon of the same mode and in the same direction as the initial photon .",
    "this process can continue through the whole ensemble resulting in an intense superradiant radiation pulse proportional to @xmath32 ( see equation [ [ eq : i_dicke_n2 ] ] ) .",
    "in contrast to superradiance observed in a perfectly coherent system , in a non - coherent system all atoms act independently with a radiation intensity scaling linearly with @xmath10 .",
    "this possibility of coherent interactions is in contrast with the common assumption that in the ism atoms , for example , mainly interact independently with the radiation field , such that the intensity of the radiation is a linear function of the atomic density .    in order to conduct a more careful investigation of the possibility of coherent interactions , especially superradiance in a hi gas",
    ", we will need to adapt dicke s original theory to the corresponding astrophysical conditions .",
    "we therefore first need to carefully understand all the assumptions that lead to a symmetrical ensemble and superradiance in the original model of @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions can be listed as follows :    * a small - sample of neutral atoms is confined to a volume @xmath33 with the walls of the volume transparent to the radiation field . *",
    "the @xmath10 two - level atoms in the sample are separated by a distance much less than @xmath34 but distant enough not to worry about any overlap between the wave functions of neighboring atoms , which would require that the wave functions be symmetrized . *",
    "the ensemble of @xmath10 initially inverted hydrogen atoms possesses a permutation symmetry under the exchange of any pair of atoms in the sample .",
    "this is a restricting condition that could prove difficult to satisfy in general . *",
    "the transition between atomic levels takes place between non - degenerate levels , collisions between atoms do not affect their internal states and collisional broadening is neglected as a result of the small size of the sample @xcite . * although it is mentioned in @xcite that the main results of his study are independent of the type of coupling between atoms and the field , the interaction of the atoms with the radiation field in dicke s model is assumed to be electric dipolar . *",
    "finally , the radiation field is assumed to be uniform through the small - sample , the electric dipoles associated to the atoms are parallel , and propagation effects neglected .    comparing a corresponding small - sample of @xmath10 neutral hydrogen atoms interacting with 21 cm line in the ism with a dicke sample",
    ", we can see that some of the assumptions made in the dicke formalism hold and some do not .",
    "for example , the transitions between the hyperfine states of a hydrogen atom take place between non - degenerate levels since the external magnetic field in the ism lifts the upper level degeneracy ( see section [ sec : the - two - level - h - sample ] ) .",
    "also , a small - sample of hi atoms found in many regions in the ism would readily verify the criterion that @xmath35 in a volume @xmath36 , and could thus be approximately assumed to experience the same 21-cm radiation field without consideration of propagation effects . on the other hand ,",
    "unlike in dicke s sample collisional and doppler broadening effects should , in the most general case , be considered because , for example , collisions between hydrogen atoms affect the internal hyperfine states in their electronic ground state through spin de - excitation @xcite .",
    "most importantly , it must also be noted that the type of coupling between hydrogen atoms and the 21 cm line is magnetic dipolar in nature .",
    "above all , the permutation symmetry of atoms , which is a key assumption in the dicke model , is difficult to be preserved in an actual situation because of dipole - dipole interactions between the atoms .",
    "dipole - dipole interactions have a @xmath37 dependency and these short - range interactions become important in small - samples where the distance between atoms @xmath38 is smaller than @xmath34 ( see section [ sec : magnetic - dipole - dipole ] below ) . in the dicke model ,",
    "the symmetry breaking effect of dipole - dipole interactions is ignored . in later studies of superradiance ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", it has been shown that in general dipole - dipole interactions break the permutation symmetry except in those configurations where all atoms have identical close - neighbor environments .",
    "this symmetry breaking effect results in weakened correlations and a subsequent deviation from a perfectly symmetrical superradiance behavior ( i.e. , the @xmath39 relation in equation [ [ eq : i_dicke_n2 ] ] ) . in a sample of @xmath10 atoms , if @xmath13 atoms ( @xmath40 ) experience a similar close - neighborhood , the correlation can build - up among this group of atoms and the intensity of radiation from the whole sample is expected to be larger than the intensity of a fully non - coherent system ( @xmath41 ) but smaller than that of a perfect superradiance system ( @xmath42 ) .    in a small - sample of @xmath10 neutral hydrogen atoms in the ism",
    "it may thus appear possible to develop coherent behaviors if the permutation symmetry is conserved among a group of atoms in the sample .",
    "this is arguably a reasonable assumption on average for an ensemble of atoms within the small volumes discussed here .",
    "that is , the different atoms in the sample are likely to be subjected to the same conditions when averaged over time and space .",
    "furthermore , we also note that in a hi - sample the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions are definitely weaker than the electric dipole - dipole interactions discussed in the literature focusing on symmetry breaking effects .      in his first paper on superradiance",
    ", dicke also extended his formalism to a large - sample , where the volume of the sample @xmath43 and the interatomic distance @xmath38 between some atoms can be greater than @xmath34 .",
    "he showed that in a large - sample , coherent radiation can occur in a particular direction @xmath44 in which the radiation from different atoms are in phase .",
    "when the phase - matching condition is satisfied in some direction @xmath44 , the initial state of the system can be described by a correlated symmetric state of type @xmath45 , and the intensity of the radiation in a solid angle along @xmath46 follows    @xmath47,\\label{eq : large - sample - dicke - intensity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similar to equation ( [ eq : i_dicke ] ) for a small - sample . when a photon is emitted in the direction @xmath44 , the system cascades to a lower state obeying the selection rules @xmath48 , and similar to the case of a small - sample ,",
    "symmetrical states of the same @xmath15 are coupled to each other through coherent transitions ( see section [ sub : two - atom - large ] ) . on the other hand , when a radiated photon has a wave vector @xmath49 , the states with different @xmath15 ( i.e. , of different symmetry ) can couple and consequently the coherence is weakened in the system @xcite .",
    "it follows that in a large - sample consisting of @xmath10 inverted atoms , the radiation by one atom is only seen to be in phase by a group of atoms ( contrary to a small - sample where the radiation field is assumed uniform over the whole sample ) , and correlation can only be developed among this group .",
    "this naturally results in a radiation intensity that is greater than that of the corresponding fully non - coherent system but smaller than the superradiance intensity of a perfectly coherent system consisting of @xmath10 atoms .",
    "finally , in a large - sample as a result of possibly large interatomic distances ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) the symmetry breaking effects of the dipole - dipole interactions are less important , whereas , the propagation effects that are absent in a small - sample can not be neglected .",
    "the propagation of radiation over a large distance in a large - sample results in the re - absorption and re - emission of the photons and consequently leads to a non - uniform evolution of the atoms in the sample ( see section [ sub : large - n - atom - sample ] ) . beyond these factors ,",
    "dicke s analysis of the large - sample includes similar assumptions as those used for the small - sample .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of neutral hydrogen atoms in the electronic ground state in some region of the ism , where it can emit or absorb photons at the @xmath51 cm wavelength .",
    "the hydrogen 21 cm line is perhaps the most important source of information in radio astronomy and arises from the transition between two levels of the hydrogen atom in the 1s ground state .",
    "the interaction between the electron spin and the proton spin in the nucleus of the atom splits the otherwise degenerate 1s energy level into the two @xmath5 and @xmath6 sub - levels .",
    "the @xmath52 transition in the absence of an external magnetic field produces the 21 cm line corresponding to a frequency @xmath53 mhz .",
    "considering a more realistic case , the magnetic field in a cold neutral gas is generally on the order of 10 @xmath54 g @xcite , and the energy level corresponding to @xmath6 splits into three sub - levels identified by @xmath55 .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 levels becomes more complicated as this splitting provides three possible hyperfine transitions , as shown in figure [ fig : leveldiagram ] .",
    "these hyperfine transitions link states of like parity and obey the general magnetic - dipole selection rules @xmath56 and @xmath57 . based on these rules ,",
    "all of the three transitions shown in figure [ fig : leveldiagram ] are allowed , however , depending on the relative orientation ( or the polarization ) of the magnetic component of the radiation field to the quantization axis of the atom , some transitions may be favored . in the more general case ,",
    "there is a mixture of all three transitions with each transition exhibiting particular polarization properties . in order to better understand the coherent and cooperative evolution of a sample of @xmath10 hydrogen atoms coupled to its radiation field",
    ", it will be simpler for us to focus our analysis on only one of these transitions and consider the atomic system as an ensemble of two - level atoms .",
    "although this model represents a significant simplification , the two - level atom approximation is extensively used for , and its results well - verified in , laboratory experiments involving more complicated atomic or molecular systems with more complex energy levels @xcite .      the theoretical model for the problem will be found in appendix [ sec : theoretical - model ] , where the hamiltonian for the two - level hi - sample is developed and the main equations of superradiance derived . to simplify our discussion",
    "we have limited our analysis to the @xmath58 transition through which a hydrogen atom emits a left circular polarization ( lcp ) photon , i.e. , with its electric field vector rotating counter - clockwise as seen by the observer facing the incoming wave .",
    "one of the main components of the hamiltonian is the magnetic dipole energy term @xmath59 that describes the interaction betweens the atoms composing the sample ( see equations [ [ eq : v_md ] ] and [ [ eq : v_mdquantized ] ] ) .",
    "we now focus on this interaction to get a sense of how the needed cooperative behavior for superradiance develops between atoms .      in order to have a better understanding of how cooperative behavior is built up in a sample of @xmath10 atoms , it is helpful to first study the simpler case of two atoms .",
    "we specifically consider a system consisting of two hydrogen atoms , once again assuming each atom is a two - level system with the excited state @xmath61 ( @xmath6 ) and the ground state @xmath62 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the two atoms are initially excited and the state of the system is given by @xmath63 .",
    "eventually one of the two atoms spontaneously decays to its ground state emitting a photon with a wavelength @xmath34 and energy @xmath64 .",
    "if the interatomic distance @xmath38 is much smaller than @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) and the two atoms are identical , then one can not say which atom has emitted the photon nor which is in a given state . in the case of the two - level hydrogen atom discussed here , this decay rate must be related to that of the corresponding magnetic dipole transition given by ( mks units )    @xmath66    we can furthermore express the state of the system by either a symmetric @xmath67 or antisymmetric @xmath68 combination of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 state vectors such as    @xmath71    which , at this stage of our analysis , have the same energy and are thus degenerate ( see below ) .",
    "we now refine this model by adding the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction term to the system s hamiltonian . in this model",
    "the magnetic dipole from one atom , say , @xmath72 , interacts with the magnetic field @xmath73 due to the dipole of the other atom located at a position @xmath74 away in the near - field , where @xmath65 @xcite    @xmath75\\left[3\\mathbf{e}_{r^{\\prime}}\\left(\\mathbf{e}_{r^{\\prime}}\\cdot\\hat{{\\bf m}}_{2}\\right)-\\hat{{\\bf m}}_{2}\\right].\\label{eq : b(r')}\\ ] ]    it can be shown that when the two dipoles are aligned , the term of the interaction hamiltonian that is relevant to the present discussion is @xmath76\\left(\\hat{r}_{1}^{+}\\hat{r}_{2}^{-}+\\hat{r}_{1}^{-}\\hat{r}_{2}^{+}\\right),\\label{eq : hdd}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 .",
    "the raising / lowering operators @xmath78 , @xmath79 , etc . , are defined in equation ( [ eq : r+- ] ) and the lcp unit vector state @xmath80 in equation ( [ eq : e+ ] ) , while @xmath81 is the bohr magneton .",
    "it can further be shown , through a simple diagonalization exercise , that this interaction hamiltonian lifts the degeneracy between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 states of equations ( [ eq:+state ] ) and ( [ eq :- state ] ) , with their corresponding energies becoming @xcite    @xmath82    with @xmath83 the unperturbed energy of the states and    @xmath84.\\label{eq : deltae}\\ ] ]    it is then also possible to verify through equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , setting @xmath85 , that the transition rates @xmath86 for the @xmath87 states with the initial @xmath88 and final @xmath89 states are    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the transition rate of a single atom acting independently .",
    "the differentiation of energy levels brought about by the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction is , therefore , seen to be a function of @xmath92 and the interatomic distance @xmath38 .",
    "more important , however , is the doubling of the transition rate for the symmetric state @xmath67 , and the cancellation of that of the antisymmetric state @xmath68 .",
    "such enhanced and reduced rates are respectively associated to superradiance and subradiance .",
    "this scenario for the two - atom system is depicted in figure [ fig : two - atoms ] .",
    "this behavior can also be understood by considering the symmetry of the system s hamiltonian and states .",
    "the fact that , as could easily be verified , the hamiltonian of the system of two atoms ( including the magnetic dipole term @xmath59 ) is totally symmetric under the permutation of the two aligned atoms when @xmath65 implies that only states of like symmetry can be coupled .",
    "it follows that since the initial state @xmath88 of the fully inverted system is also symmetric , it can only couple to the @xmath67 intermediate state , and from there to the symmetric ground state of the system @xmath89 .",
    "accordingly , it is interesting to note that under these conditions a system prepared in the intermediate antisymmetric state @xmath68 will not decay to the ground state since @xmath93 .",
    "this is evidently different from the case of a non - coherent system where the both atoms eventually decay to their individual ground state @xmath62 at the rate @xmath91 .",
    "we therefore see that superradiance and subradiance are characteristics of a coherent system , where the intensity of radiation does not scale linearly with the number of atoms , as is the case for a non - coherent system .    when the effect discussed here is generalized to a sample composed of @xmath10 atoms confined within a volume @xmath33 ( a small - sample ) , we find that some of the conditions that prevailed for the two - atom case are not realized .",
    "most importantly , equations ( [ eq : e+- ] ) and ( [ eq : deltae ] ) indicate that this interaction leads to a distribution of energy levels in the system unless the atoms all have similar nearest neighborhood ( e.g. , a ring - like periodic distribution of atoms ; @xcite ) . this spread in energy levels will tend to reduce the strength of the superradiance effect .",
    "it has nonetheless been observed through numerical calculations and experiments that coherent behaviors still apply to @xmath10-atom small - sample systems where radiation is of long enough wavelength @xcite , as is the case for 21 cm line .",
    "for @xmath94 the ratio @xmath95 is exceedingly small for the 21 cm line , and the time - scale associated with the energy shifts is on the order of @xmath96 @xcite , which for the hi densities considered in this paper renders this type of dephasing negligible . as will be discussed later , dephasing due to collisions",
    "are more likely to set the time - scale for homogeneous dephasing .",
    "the same is not necessarily true at short wavelengths where it is very difficult to place a large number of atoms within a sub - wavelength dimension in a regular pattern , and in such a sample strong dipole - dipole interactions break the symmetry and terminate the coherent behavior by introducing large energy - level shifts .",
    "thus most of the experimental observations of superradiance took place at longer wavelengths ( i.e. , in the infrared as opposed to optical ; @xcite ) .",
    "for an inverted @xmath10-atom small - sample with initially uncorrelated dipoles the first photon emitted by one of the atoms interacts with the dipole moments of the other atoms , resulting in the build up of correlation between them . after some time , known as the delay time @xmath97 , a very high degree of correlation",
    "is developed in the system , where in the strongest superradiance regime , the @xmath10 microscopic dipoles eventually act like one macroscopic dipole .",
    "the rate of emission is then enhanced to @xmath98 , while the radiation intensity is proportional to @xmath32 and becomes highly directional , being focussed in a beam with a temporal half - width on the order of * @xmath99*.    it should also be noted that the correlation between dipoles can be triggered by an external source such as an input radiation field .",
    "this can happen if the input radiation field is stronger than the spontaneous fluctuations in the sample , and the coupling of the dipoles to the external field leads to coherent behaviors .",
    "an enhancement of radiation through coupling to an external field is called _ triggered superradiance _ @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the superradiance radiation intensity @xmath42 of an ideal hi small - sample composed of @xmath10 inverted atoms is given by @xcite    @xmath100,\\label{eq : i_sr - ideal - small - sample}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 is the energy of the corresponding atomic transition and the aforementioned delay time @xmath101 . in figure",

    "the intensity is normalized to @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is for the corresponding non - coherent small - sample .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ fig : ideal - small - sample ] that the energy stored in the small - sample is radiated away in a single burst .",

    "it should also be pointed out that in such a sample the correlation between dipoles is initiated by internal spontaneous fluctuations and it is assumed that we are dealing with an ideal system , where the dipole - dipole symmetry breaking effects are negligible and there are no other relaxation mechanisms ( i.e. , cooperative emission is the only decay mechanism ) .    in a real system , there are some relaxation and dephasing effects that compete with the build - up of the correlation , and in order to subsequently have superradiance , its characteristics time - scale @xmath111 and delay time * @xmath97 * must be shorter than ( in some exceptional cases on the order of ) the relaxation / dephasing time - scales @xcite .",
    "the non - ideal case will be discussed in section [ sub : non - ideal - case ] .",
    "let us still assume that the atoms are prepared initially in their excited states , with the state of the two - atom system given by @xmath88 .",
    "similar to the sub - wavelength case , a first photon is radiated leaving the system in an intermediate state , which unlike as we did for the sub - wavelength case , will be described with any combination of @xmath69 and @xmath70 states with each having equal probability contributions , i.e. , not only by the @xmath67 and @xmath68 states .",
    "more precisely , if we associate the general symmetric state    @xmath113    to the intermediate state shown in the left side of of figure [ fig : two - atoms - large ] , then we should assign its orthogonal antisymmetric state    @xmath114    to the intermediate state on the right side of the figure @xcite . in equations ( [ eq:+state - large - r ] ) and ( [ eq : state - large - r ] ) , @xmath115 is a phase term discriminating between the multiple choices for the intermediate states . to get a better understanding of the transition probabilities for these states , it is useful to refer to equation ( [ eq : v_mdquantized ] ) for the magnetic dipole interaction term with a radiation field for two atoms separated by @xmath116 and for a given @xmath46 .",
    "we then find that for coupling to , say , the @xmath88 state the following term comes into play    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the angle between @xmath46 and @xmath116 .",
    "given that the transition probability ( and rates ) are proportional to @xmath119 and @xmath120 @xcite , we calculate using equation ( [ eq:+state - large - r ] ) , ( [ eq : state - large - r ] ) , and ( [ eq : wmdlarge ] )    @xmath121\\right\\ } \\label{eq : gammas}\\\\ \\gamma_{a } & \\propto & \\sin^{2}\\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\phi - kr^{\\prime}\\cos\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\\right\\ } .\\label{eq : gammaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we therefore see that , although the first photon can be emitted in any direction @xmath118 , its direction of emission determines @xmath115 and the intermediate state of the system since the transition probabilities peak at @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath125 ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 are integers ) .",
    "going through the same exercise for the @xmath89 state shows a similar dependency on @xmath118 and @xmath115 as in equations ( [ eq : gammas ] ) and ( [ eq : gammaa ] ) , which implies that these transitions rates will also be likely to peak at the same value of @xmath115 .",
    "it follows that there is an angular correlation between two successive photons , where the direction of the second photon is correlated with the direction of the first .",
    "this angular correlation can take place even when the atoms are placed several wavelengths apart , as a result of their coupling to a common electromagnetic field , and favors intense radiation along elongated geometries ( e.g. , pencil - like or cylindrical structures ; @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the intermediate state of the system two different classes of transitions are possible ; coherent and non - coherent .",
    "if the emission of the first photon leaves the system in a symmetric intermediate state ( e.g. , @xmath128 ) the symmetric coupling to the radiation field results in the coherent behavior and consequently the system decays to the symmetric ground state @xmath89 with the corresponding transition rate shown in figure [ fig : two - atoms - large ] . on the other hand",
    ", if the system is in the antisymmetric intermediate state @xmath129 the coupling to the radiation field will be antisymmetric under the exchange of the atoms as they interact with the non - uniform electromagnetic field , and the system decays non - coherently to the ground state @xmath89 with the decay rate @xmath125 .",
    "we can also explain this classically by considering two classical radiators separated by a distance @xmath130 . over large distances , the phase and",
    "the polarization of the radiation field emitted by each radiator varies from place to place .",
    "when the radiation from the two identical radiators interferes , the intensity of the total field is given by    @xmath131    and can become as large as four times of the intensity of a single radiator @xmath29 if    @xmath132    if the phase of the radiation from different radiators does not match perfectly , the term containing the correlation @xmath133 in equation ( [ eq : classical - interference - intensity ] ) becomes smaller than @xmath29 and consequently the total intensity @xmath134 decreases until it reaches its minimum for completely out of phase radiators .",
    "furthermore , the correlation term can vanish when radiators act independently . in this case , the total intensity becomes equal to the sum of the intensities of the two independent radiators ( the so - called non - coherent system ) .",
    "we can extend our discussion for the case of two distant atoms ( i.e. , @xmath130 ) to a large - sample consisting of @xmath10 atoms distributed over a volume @xmath43 . as stated above , the build - up of correlations in an extended @xmath10-atom sample",
    "can be understood as a constructive interference of the radiation by different atoms . in a large - sample as a result of propagation over large distances ( i.e. , larger than @xmath34 )",
    "the phase of the radiation varies throughout the sample ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) .",
    "consequently , the phase of the atomic magnetization differs with position . in an inverted large - sample ,",
    "the radiation from different atoms interfere with each other , and when the magnetization of the radiators are perfectly in phase , an intense propagating wave is produced in one direction ( the phase - matching condition can not be satisfied in all directions ) .    in order to better understand the phase - matching process , it is useful to go back to the angular correlation effect described in the two - atom case . in a large - sample of @xmath10 inverted atoms , when the first photon is emitted other atoms",
    "interact with its radiation field and the direction of the next photon is affected by the first one . in a more general sense ,",
    "when a photon is radiated in a particular direction @xmath44 , it becomes more probable to observe the second photon in the same direction @xmath44 than any other direction .",
    "thus , as the atoms radiate , an angular correlation builds up in the sample that triggers the phase - matching process in a well - defined direction .",
    "ideal superradiance is the result of the symmetrical evolution of an atom - field system , and in a large - sample , the propagation effects result in the non - uniform evolution of the atoms in the sample . in order to better understand propagation effects in a large - sample",
    ", the atomic medium can be divided into small identical slices with dimensions larger than @xmath34 but much smaller than the length of the sample .",
    "a microscopic dipole is then associated to each slice with its magnitude being proportional to the number of excited atoms in the corresponding slice . at the beginning ,",
    "the dipoles in different slices are independent and their radiation uncorrelated . after some time ( or the so - called retarded - time delay @xmath138 ; see equation ( [ eq : delay - time - large - sample ] ) below ) , as they interact with their common radiation field , the dipoles lock to a common phase , and act as a single macroscopic dipole radiating intensely with @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the enhancement factor of the superradiant intensity @xmath42 over the non - coherent intensity @xmath41 determined by the efficiency of the common phase - locking process ( through the value of @xmath141 ) .",
    "the enhancement factor @xmath140 can become very large in samples with @xmath35 , and it converges to @xmath10 in an atomic system with dimensions of the order of @xmath34 resulting in @xmath142 for the most efficient phase - locking process seen in a small - sample .",
    "in other words , @xmath143 implies a limited coherent behavior in a large - sample resulting in a smaller output intensity and weakened superradiance , whereas @xmath144 indicates a fully coherent behavior leading to an intense radiation and perfect superradiance @xcite .",
    "this approach has the shortcoming that it can not explain the initiation of the radiation in the system by spontaneous fluctuations , and to overcome this problem phenomenological fluctuations of dipoles in the initial stages of the evolution can be added to the formalism .",
    "in contrast , triggered superradiance can be fully explained in this manner as the correlation process is initiated by an external field , which can be defined classically .",
    "it must be pointed out that the results of this method are valid only if the propagation time of the radiation @xmath145 through a sample of length @xmath146 ( i.e. , @xmath147 ) is smaller than the superradiance characteristic time @xmath111 given by    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is the spontaneous decay time of a single atom and @xmath150 the density of inverted atoms ( see @xcite , and appendix [ sec : non - linear - regime ] ) .",
    "this condition ( i.e. , @xmath151 ) is known as arecchi - courtens condition , and it ensures that the atomic magnetization in different parts of the sample can lock into a common phase and coherent behavior can develop through the sample .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : theoretical - model ] , we derive the evolution equations for the radiation field and the atomic system using the heisenberg representation , while in appendix [ sec : non - linear - regime ] we solve the corresponding maxwell - bloch system of equations , at resonance , within the framework of the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) .",
    "to do so , we adopted the following form for the radiation magnetic field and atomic magnetization    @xmath152    with @xmath153 and @xmath154 corresponding slowly varying envelope operators .",
    "the superradiance of a cylindrical large - sample of length @xmath146 under ideal conditions is then found to be determined by the following equations for , respectively , the magnetization , the population inversion , and the magnetic field    @xmath155    where @xmath156 .",
    "the solution for the bloch angle @xmath157 as a function of the retarded - time @xmath158 is obtained through the so - called sine - gordon equation    @xmath159    with    @xmath160    in figure [ fig : idealcase - largesample ] we show the solution for the radiation intensity of such an ideal cylindrical large - sample of hi atoms of length @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the speed of the light , by numerically solving equations ( [ eq : m0+(theta ) ] ) to ( [ eq : q - main_text ] ) . for these calculations we set a fresnel number of unity to reduce the impact of diffraction losses , which are not taken into account in our model .",
    "this yields a cylinder of radius    @xmath163    which for our ideal sample results in @xmath164 .    in this sample , the arecchi - courtens condition is satisfied ( i.e. , @xmath165 ) allowing the use of the homogeneous condition @xmath166 rad for the initial value of the bloch angle . more precisely , for the large - sample used for the figure we assumed that internal fluctuations dominate over triggered superradiance , and the initial bloch angle was set with @xmath167 @xcite .    in figure [",
    "fig : idealcase - largesample ] , the retarded - time axis is scaled to @xmath111 and the radiation intensity to @xmath105 , i.e. , the number of inverted atoms times the corresponding non - coherent intensity that would otherwise be expected from such a sample . more precisely ,",
    "for comparison purposes we consider the non - coherent intensity emanating through the sample s end - fire ( i.e. , the end facing the observer ) of area @xmath168 , within the superradiance radiation beam solid - angle @xmath169 ( in the direction @xmath46 along which the phase - locking condition is satisfied ) normalized to the solid angle associated to the total non - coherent radiation .",
    "we thus have    @xmath170    where equation ( [ eq : tr - largesample ] ) was used for the last step and @xmath171 is the total energy initially stored in the sample .",
    "as shown in the figure , this energy is radiated away through multiple bursts , a phenomenon known as ringing effect .",
    "this effect can be explained by the fact that atoms in different locations in the sample radiate at different times . in other words ,",
    "an atom at location @xmath172 , prepared in the excited state at @xmath173 , radiates its energy away and decays to its ground state , then later on absorbs the energy radiated by another atom at a location @xmath174 and becomes excited leading to another radiation event .    in a large - sample , just as in a small - sample , internal field fluctuations or an external field trigger superradiance , and after the delay time @xmath138 the atoms radiate coherently .",
    "but contrary to a small - sample , the large - sample delay time depends on the initial conditions and is given by @xcite    @xmath175    in fige first burst of radiation occurs after @xmath176 , which is consistent with the value one finds using equation ( [ eq : delay - time - large - sample ] ) . as can also be seen , this first intensity burst only carries out a fraction of the total energy stored in the sample , while the remaining radiation happens through subsequent bursts .",
    "the number of burst events depends on the length of the sample , and as the length is increased radiation emanates through a larger number of bursts , while the peak intensity of consecutive burst events gradually drops .",
    "this is a consequence of energy conservation and the fact that in a larger ( i.e. , longer ) sample radiation from different groups of atoms along the sample arrive at the end - fire at different times , and the process of absorbing the radiation , developing correlations between the dipoles , and eventually re - emitting the radiation repeats multiple times over a very long period of time . on the other hand , when the length of the sample is decreased the ringing effect becomes weaker until , for a small - sample of dimension of order of @xmath34 , it totally washes out and we only observe a single burst of radiation carrying away all the energy stored in the system ( as in figure [ fig : ideal - small - sample ] ) . finally , we note that although the maximum radiation intensity seen in figure [ fig : idealcase - largesample ] seem to imply that @xmath177 , the large number of atoms present in the sample ensures that @xmath178 ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we should also note , however , that the sine - gordon equation is very sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "it therefore follows that the exact shape of the intensity curve , e.g. , the number of bursts in figure [ fig : idealcase - largesample ] , is also strongly dependent on @xmath179 .      as was mentioned earlier , the characteristics time - scale of superradiance @xmath111 and the delay time @xmath138 ( for a large - sample ) must be shorter than the relaxation / dephasing time - scales to allow the build - up of correlations in a non - ideal sample .",
    "these effects include natural broadening due to the spontaneous decay time - scale @xmath180 of a single atom and collisional broadening related to the mean time between collisions @xmath181 for an atom in the sample .",
    "although , as was stated in section [ sec : introduction ] , our analysis is aimed at regions of the ism where thermal equilibrium has not been reached and where consequently the assignation of a temperature to determine , for example , collision rates is perhaps ill - defined , we will nonetheless adopt such a procedure for the rest of our discussion to get a sense of the time - scales involved . accordingly , in a hi gas different types of collisions can take place depending on the temperature and density . for environments of temperatures ranging from approximately @xmath182 to @xmath183 , which are the focus of our analysis , collisions between two neutral hydrogen atoms ( h - h collisions ) dominate and fall into two categories : elastic and inelastic .",
    "during an elastic h - h collision , the spacing between the atomic energy levels are slightly affected but no transition between them is induced .",
    "the change in energy spacing occurs as a result of short - range interaction forces between the two colliding particles and induces a phase shift in the wave function of the scattered atoms . after a number of elastic collisions ,",
    "an atom can lose coherence with the interacting radiation field as a result of the randomness in the perturbations . on the other hand , in an inelastic h - h collision the internal energy of the hydrogen atoms",
    "will be changed .",
    "this occurs when the two hydrogen atoms with oppositely directed electron spins approach each other at distances less than approximately @xmath184 cm .",
    "this process is known as electron exchange or spin de - excitation effect . as a result of such a collision",
    "the induced phase shift can lead to a change in the internal spin states @xcite , and it is found that spin de - excitation is the dominating relaxation process in a high density collision - dominated hi gas .",
    "we therefore find that h - h collisions not only can affect the strength of a potential coherent 21-cm radiation by removing from the population of the excited hyperfine states , they also contribute to the line breadth and can change the shape of the spectral line by affecting the spacing between internal energy levels .",
    "for example , the time - scale of h - h collisions are estimated to be on the order of @xmath185 sec in the case of elastic scattering and @xmath186 sec for spin de - excitations , using the mean effective collisional cross sections given in @xcite for a hi gas at @xmath187 and @xmath188 . the mean time between collision @xmath181",
    "is thus set to the shortest of these time - scales and must at least be larger than @xmath111 and @xmath138 to allow coherent behavior ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "in addition , other broadening effects , such as doppler broadening , are further dephasing mechanisms that can destroy cooperative behavior if their time - scales ( importantly the so - called doppler dephasing time , i.e. , the reciprocal of the doppler width ) are smaller than @xmath111 and @xmath138 @xcite . in a thermally relaxed gas ,",
    "thermal motions are probably the most important dephasing effects and result in line broadenings that correspond to very short dephasing time - scales ( e.g. , @xmath189 sec at @xmath190 k ) . in the presence of such strong dephasing effects , correlations can not develop between the dipoles and any coherent interaction will be terminated right from the start .",
    "hence our earlier comment that we do not expect to find superradiance under conditions of thermal equilibrium , but potentially only in ( out - of - equilibrium ) regions where strong velocity coherence can be maintained along the line - of - sight .",
    "furthermore , this condition may be only met among a group of atoms in such regions , therefore reducing the number of inverted atoms in the sample that could participate in coherent interactions .",
    "however , we know from maser observations that a high level of velocity coherence can be achieved in some regions of the ism , and we expect that superradiance could happen under similar conditions . as was mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] , the main inversion pumping mechanism likely involved for the 21 cm transition points to the surroundings of hii as potentials sites for superradiance in this spectral line . *",
    "* it follows that we should also anticipate analogous ( i.e. , very small ) volume filling factor for the emitting regions of superradiant sources as for masers .    in figure",
    "[ fig : equaldeaphsing - largesample ] the intensity of the hi large - sample discussed in section [ sub : large - n - atom - sample ] ( and presented in figure [ fig : idealcase - largesample ] for the ideal case ) is plotted as a function of the retarded - time @xmath191 for the special case where dephasing / relaxation effects are included and characterized by a single time - scale set to @xmath192 ( see sections [ sec : discussion ] and appendix [ sec : non - linear - regime ] ) .",
    "these results were obtained by once again numerically solving equation ( [ eq : s - g ] ) , while the magnetization and population inversion are given by    @xmath193    and the dimensionless parameter    @xmath194    with    @xmath195    the magnetic field is once again given by equation ( [ eq : b0+(theta ) ] ) .",
    "the intensity and time axes are scaled as those of figure [ fig : idealcase - largesample ] for the ideal hi sample .",
    "we can see from figure [ fig : equaldeaphsing - largesample ] that the ringing effect seen in the ideal sample is also present here but is weakened by the dephasing and basically terminated after @xmath196 ( i.e. , approximately the dephasing time - scale ) .",
    "the dephasing effects also affect the maximum energy radiated away through each burst event , and result in slightly weaker intensities .",
    "as was made evident from our previous discussions , the characteristic time - scale of superradiance @xmath111 is a fundamental criterion to consider in the investigation of this cooperative behavior .",
    "for an ideal small - sample of volume @xmath197 @xmath198 , for total hydrogen densities @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 and a population inversion @xmath202 , the superradiance time - scale    @xmath203    is such that @xmath204 sec , where @xmath205 sec for the 21 cm line . as mentioned in section [ sub : non - ideal - case ] , @xmath97 ( @xmath206 , in this case ) must be shorter than the relaxation / dephasing time - scales in order to allow the build - up of cooperative behaviors in the sample . in a typical hi gas ,",
    "an important relaxation mechanism for an atom is collisional de - excitation , the rate for which is given by @xmath207    values for the collisional de - excitation rate coefficient @xmath208 for the hyperfine state @xmath6 over a range of temperatures can be found in @xcite , and for @xmath209 we find @xmath210 sec for the previous range of atomic hydrogen densities .",
    "these collision rates become @xmath211 sec when elastic collisions are considered @xcite .",
    "it can thus be seen that the expected collisional relaxation time - scales are likely to render superradiance improbable for small hi sample , especially at higher temperatures .",
    "this suggests the investigation of larger samples containing more atoms .",
    "although in a large - sample the general cooperative behavior is weaker than the ideal dicke superradiance , the greater number of atoms will reduce @xmath111 , increase the radiation intensity , and make it more likely to observe the effect .",
    "however , it is also important to realize that not only must the condition @xmath212 be realized for establishing superradiance , such that the non - coherent de - excitation does not become the dominant mechanism to release the energy of the system , but we must also ensure that @xmath213 is verified since @xmath214 from equation ( [ eq : delay - time - large - sample ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the delay time needed to establish coherence in the sample must also be smaller than the dephasing time - scale .",
    "it is important to note that the requirement @xmath213 effectively sets a threshold that must be met for the onset of superradiance . from the dependency of @xmath138 on the different parameters ( see equation [ [ eq : delay - time - large - sample ] ] ) we find",
    "that , for a given transition , it can only be reduced below @xmath215 through a corresponding increase of the inverted population s column density @xmath216 .",
    "it follows that superradiance will only be triggered when the column density meets or exceeds some critical value @xcite .",
    "contrary to what is the case for laboratory superradiance experiments where short laser pulses are used to create the necessary population inversion , the existence of a threshold also implies that there is no requirement for the presence of a pulse to initiate superradiance in the ism ( but see below ) .",
    "it only matters that a critical level of inversion is reached , and the rate at which it is attained is irrelevant .",
    "however , stronger superradiance bursts can be achieved in the presence of population - inverting pulses that bring the column density to levels significantly exceeding its critical value .",
    "but in such cases the values attained for @xmath216 can be limited by the pumping time @xmath217 over which the population inversion is achieved throughout the sample .",
    "for example , * * as we increase the length of the sample @xmath111 and @xmath138 decrease , but on the other hand , it becomes necessary to achieve the population inversion over a larger length - scale .",
    "there are two types of pumping mechanisms available to achieve the population inversion in an atomic system : swept pumping and instantaneous pumping @xcite . in",
    "the swept pumping scenario the atomic sample is pumped longitudinally by a pulse traveling along the sample , and the pumping process is characterized by a finite pumping time @xmath217 , whereas for instantaneous pumping a transverse excitation causes the simultaneous excitation of all atoms in the sample resulting in @xmath218 . when the pumping process can not be achieved instantaneously , but is realized over a finite time , the output intensity of a small- or a large - sample are only affected slightly as long as @xmath219 .",
    "the main effect of the finite pumping time is then an increase in the delay time of the superradiant process in comparison to what one expects from equation ( [ eq : delay - time - large - sample ] ) , i.e. , the actual delay time @xmath220 will be longer than the theoretical delay time @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "however , if pumping occurs * * at an approximately * * constant rate * * over some pulse * * time interval in a hi gas ( i.e. , @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is a constant ) and the first burst of superradiance radiation is emitted before the expected inversion density @xmath150 is achieved throughout the sample , then we need to replace @xmath150 by its effective value at time @xmath223 ( i.e. , @xmath224 ) . in this case ,",
    "only a fraction of atoms contribute to the first burst , and the system can not emit as much of the energy stored within it through a series of coherent bursts @xcite . if the pulse ( i.e. , pumping ) time becomes too long and the first superradiant burst is emitted before the inversion is achieved along the sample , only a few coherent bursts can be observed .",
    "this happens as the system reaches a quasi - steady state , in which the growth and depletion of population occur with the same rates . in the quasi - steady state",
    "the radiation intensity is given by @xmath225 , and is no longer proportional to @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the transition from a superradiant to the quasi - steady regime was first observed in the laboratory by @xcite . for an astronomical system , this would correspond to passing from a superradiant system to an astronomical ( i.e. , mirror - less ) maser .",
    "we therefore conclude that in the ism superradiance will not happen in a steady state regime , but will rather be characterized by strong variability in radiation intensities over time",
    ". one could , for example , conceive of an emitting region harboring a maser that would be episodically modulated with strong bursts of radiation due to superradiance , perhaps resulting from some radiative trigger or a sudden decrease in @xmath138 ( from a corresponding increase in the inverted population ; for example , see * * @xcite ) .    in a more general context ,",
    "i.e. , without limiting the discussion to the @xmath226 cm line , it is also important to note that superradiance triggered through population - inverting pulses ( that bring @xmath216 significantly above its critical value ) can not result if these pulses are due to collisions alone .",
    "this is because of the undesirable consequences collisions have on the dephasing / relaxation of a sample .",
    "that is , if @xmath217 is the pumping time due to collisions , then we know from our previous discussion that @xmath219 for pulse - initiated superradiance to be possible .",

    "that is , if we assume a reasonable maser spot size for the population inverted region ( e.g. , @xmath253 au ) , then it becomes possible that a very large number of superradiant system could simultaneously erupt ( @xmath254 ) and render a strong detection more likely , when the conditions for superradiance are met @xcite .",
    "this leads us to suggest that despite the simplicity of , and the approximations used in , our model significant intensity variability due to superradiance could be detectable for the 21 cm line in some regions of the ism .",
