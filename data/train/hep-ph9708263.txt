    "the description of physical systems that are out of thermal and chemical equilibrium has its origins in the early work of boltzmann in 1872 which describes the development of a system via an equation for the single particle distribution function .",
    "the formal derivation of non - relativistic transport equations from a specific field theory can be traced back to the work of kadanoff and baym @xcite , but which can be succinctly stated in a closed time path ( ctp ) formalism that is independently due to schwinger and keldysh @xcite . to date , this formalism has been applied to many non - relativistic problems , but also to some in its relativistic generalization .",
    "there are several excellent books and reviews available @xcite , which elucidate the techniques , both from an operator or path integral point of view , to which we refer the reader .",
    "recently there has been an additional surge of interest in non - equilibrium formulations of field theory from the nuclear physics community , as a need exists for describing heavy - ion collisions within such a framework .",
    "a seminal article on this topic is that of mrwczyski and heinz @xcite , who , independently of schnhofen et al .",
    "@xcite , have derived transport equations for the walecka model .",
    "the derivation of such transport equations is in fact more general than appears on first sight , and the basic equations of motion for the green functions , as they occur in ref.@xcite are applicable to any field theory .",
    "the major difficulty in the fermionic sector lies in the fact that ( a ) there are in general 16 @xmath8 2 equations to be solved , and ( b ) should one in any event introduce a simplifying assumption such as the quasiparticle approximation , one has to perform a complicated evaluation of the self - energy that goes beyond the mean field approximation , if one wishes to describe interesting physics .",
    "while this has often been done ( see for example , ref.@xcite ) , it is often unclear how the final collision integral is related to scattering diagrams _ in a strict feynman sense _ , although one knows heuristically that the boltzmann equation must emerge from a semi - classical approximation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold . on the one hand , we wish to make clear how the collision term in a specific model is related to the boltzmann equation via feynman ( and _ not _ heuristic ) diagrams in evaluating the scattering cross section that appears in this expression , and also to explicitly demonstrate the limits of the quasiparticle assumption in that it supresses vacuum fluctuations and particle production and annihilation processes that would be present if the on - shell condition were relaxed .",
    "although the calculation is performed for a specific model , its generality is evident . a transport calculation for qcd , or any other theory involving relativistic fermions ,",
    "for that matter , should also display the structure given in this paper thus this calculation gives a working guide for the general construction of the collision term .",
    "the second purpose of this manuscript is to develop the transport theory for a fermionic _ chiral _ lagrangian , in our case , the minimal version of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "this specific choice is motivated by the following physical considerations .",
    "lattice simulations of qcd , which are _ equilibrium _ studies of this field theory , show a chiral phase transition at a fixed value of the temperature @xcite , a feature which can be simply modelled by the njl lagrangian , see for example @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the difficulties inherent in qcd itself , there appears to be no means of observing such a phase transition in an equilibrium system and extract , for example , critical exponents .",
    "rather , the experimental search for clues to a phase transition that has been conceived , is to proceed via heavy ion collisions , in which both high temperatures and densities are to be reached .",
    "much effort has been expended in this direction and will continue to be so during the early course of the next century , particularly at rhic and cern .",
    "in addition , the simple equilibrium picture of the static lattice simulations is inadequate for a complete description of such heavy ion experiments .",
    "we note that , from the theoretical side , there is at present no single conclusive observable that might indicate the occurrence of the chiral phase transition , given that one is dealing with a non - equilibrium system mass .",
    "such changes , however , are inferred from model calculations , usually together with additional assumptions @xcite , and they differ according to the approach taken . ] . thus we may speculate as to whether a concrete signal of this phase transition can be obtained from a non - equilibrium formulation of the problem or transport theory , for a simplified field theory _ that is based on an underlying chiral lagrangian _ and which therefor displays the same symmetry structure as qcd .",
    "here one may surmise whether phenomena such as critical scattering@xcite , i.e. divergence of the scattering cross - sections at the phase transition , may leave an obvious signal , or simply the fact that the dynamically generated quark mass is a function of space and time may leave some visible remnant of a phase transition .",
    "our starting point is thus the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , that intrinsically contains only quark degrees of freedom that interact via an effective two body ( in @xmath9 ) and , in addition , three body interactions for three flavors .",
    "mesonic states are constructed as collective excitations in this model .",
    "no explicit gluonic degrees of freedom are included .",
    "for our purposes , it is sufficient to study the simplest form of this model that displays the features of chiral symmetry , and we will thus restrict ourselves to the simplest form of lagrange density that does so .    for the derivation of transport equations , the schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite for non - equilibrium green functions is applied , in what is by now a standard approach @xcite .",
    "we follow closely the approach of ref.@xcite .",
    "the associated equations of motion for the wigner functions are then written down in a general manner that pertains to _ any _ fermionic theory .",
    "the difficulty in solution , on the other hand , as has been pointed out , has its origins primarily in the complication caused by the fact that one is dealing with relativistic spinors @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct the transport and constraint equations for the njl model lagrange density that we have chosen .",
    "there are four esssential ingredients to this calculation .",
    "\\(i ) we choose to make a quasiparticle expansion of the wigner function at a rather early stage of the derivation , and ( ii ) we do not allow for spin effects .",
    "this reduces the independent functions to simply be the distribution functions for quarks and antiquarks for which equations of motion are derived , whose ingredients are the self - energies . these two assumptions , while not necessary in principle , reduce the complexity of the manipulations tremendously .",
    "they also correspond to what is at present possible in numerical calculations .",
    "( iii ) noting that the njl model is a strong interaction theory , one requires a non - perturbative expansion of the self - energies in the inverse number of colors @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "( iv ) in addition , transport equations are usually made tractable by introducing a derivative expansion .",
    "we take the classical limit of the transport equation , classifying all the terms in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "note that this only partly corresponds to the derivative expansion that is usually made .",
    "thus there are _ two _ relevant expansions here , which are to be overlaid .",
    "we treat this double expansion with great care , and explicitly display all powers of @xmath1 explicitly .",
    "it is essential at each stage of the expansion , that in addition to the usual constraint of energy conservation , chiral symmetry is also preserved . to this end , ( i ) the @xmath0 expansion must be consistently applied and ( ii ) it is important to see that the semiclassical expansion does not destroy the symmetry properties .",
    "this has been rigorously proven for the lowest order terms in @xmath0 .    to start with",
    ", we examine the terms of @xmath2 in the expansion .",
    "this corresponds to taking the hartree term only .",
    "such a calculation is usually performed self - consistently and this is our approach here also .",
    "we then derive the transport and constraint equations to @xmath2 , and this is done semi - classically , where only the leading terms according to powers of @xmath1 are retained .",
    "note that the aspect of chiral symmetry enters into these equations at this point in the property of the subsidiary equation , the gap equation , which must be solved concomitantly with the transport and constraint equations .",
    "we next move to terms of order @xmath10 that give rise to collisions .",
    "the lowest of these terms contains two interaction lines . according to our philosophy of working in a @xmath0 expansion ,",
    "the self - consistently evaluated hartree green functions must now be employed in this evaluation . in this approximation",
    ", we again derive the transport and constraint equations , and again use @xmath1 ordering to decide to what level terms in these equations should be accepted . in doing so",
    ", we are able to demonstrate explicitly , in a fully relativistic fashion , that the boltzmann - like collision term is recovered , containing as heuristically expected , matrix elements for the elastic scattering processes , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , here of course only in the born approximation . in an exact sense",
    ", we have rewritten the collision term in terms of scattering cross - sections with _ well defined feynman graphs _ , and we have illustrated explicitly which self - energy graphs are required to obtain our result . in doing this , we have generalized the non - relativistic treatment of kadanoff and baym @xcite .",
    "several other authors have examined the collision term , see for example refs.@xcite . to our knowledge , however , this is the first paper that links the cross - sections that occur in the boltzmann - like equation with feynman graphs for the scattering processes",
    ".    there is , however , a major difference that arises here . by direct calculation",
    ", one sees explicitly that , even at this level , terms which describe the three body creation and annihilation processes , such as @xmath13 as well as vacuum fluctuations , are present , but are suppressed by the on - shell requirement of the quasiparticle approximation . relaxing this condition would lead automatically to particle production / destruction .",
    "the above calculations have been carried out , in this first exploratory article , by considering only one term in the @xmath0 expansion . clearly the full set is required that would completely include the mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this generalization to include the complete mesonic sector is however in itself a complex problem , which builds on the concepts and ideas presented here .",
    "again , in this context , care must be taken in the @xmath1 expansion , to see that the properties of chiral symmetry remain intact . using these methods",
    ", it should become possible to construct a consistent theory of quarks and mesons in which the collision term contains _",
    "inter alia _ the hadronization processes @xmath14 in addition to the usual elastic scattering @xmath12 and @xmath11 in the quark sector .",
    "the details of the mesonic sector , however , are left to a future publication @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning some other papers that are relevant , but we do not attempt to provide an exhaustive list .",
    "relativistic kinetic equations for a yukawa model were first derived in ref.@xcite . here the difficulties in expressing the collision integral in terms of actual feynman graphs is apparent .",
    "a seminal paper discussing the walecka model has followed this @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "a transport theory for the njl model , derived from a path integral approach with a semi - bosonized lagrangian was first undertaken by @xcite .",
    "we differ from this in two respects , viz ( i ) our approach is canonical , and treats the theory from a fermionic point of view , and ( ii ) that the terms are ordered according to the double expansion with regard to @xmath0 as well as the power counting in @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we review the general non - equilibrium transport theory for fermions , derived from a canonical point of view .",
    "we construct the general transport and constraint equations . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the quasiparticle approximation , introduce our lagrange density and explain the strategy of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 expansions . in section iv",
    ", we calculate the mean field self - energy and transport and constraint equations in the hartree approximation .",
    "we devote section v to the evaluation of the collision term and demonstrate that the classical limit leads us to the boltzmann equation .",
    "off - shell terms that are dropped are seen explicitly .",
    "the constraint equation , to this level of approximation , is also given . in this section",
    ", we present the major new work of this paper .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "we have , for completeness , included several appendices that give closer detail of some of the technical and / or repetitive aspects of the derivations .    0.5 in",
    "non - equilibrium phenomena are completely described via the schwinger - keldysh formalism for green functions @xcite .",

    "these can be summarized into the compact matrix notation @xmath20 the matrix of irreducible proper self - energies , @xmath21 is introduced via the dyson equation , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the matrix of propagators for the non - interacting system . in a standard fashion ,",
    "one constructs equations of motion for the matrix of green functions .",
    "these take the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 has been introduced .",
    "note that the entries in the matrices of green functions , eq.([green ] ) and self - energies eq.([self ] ) are amongst one another not independent .",

    "we give a brief derivation of the transport and constraint equations following the lines of ref.@xcite , explicitly . ] and writing them in a concise form .",
    "it will be sufficient for us to examine only one component of this equation , the off diagonal element @xmath35 , together with the equation for the hermitian conjugate .",
    "this simplification arises from the quasiparticle approximation ( see below ) in which all four green functions @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of two distribution functions .",

    "one has to specify the particular theory that one wishes to investigate  in our case , this is the simplest version of the njl model  and to calculate the self - energy terms systematically . in particular , the difficulty that we wish to address in this paper , is the evaluation of the collision term in a form that is understandable on physical grounds .",

    "similar decompositions for all other quantities are required , so that an extremely complicated system of coupled equations results .",
    "while this guarantees a correct solution from a _ formal _ point of view , even in the collisionless system , it leads to a set of @xmath59 equations that must be solved simultaneously @xcite . only in limited cases where spatial gradients have been neglected ,",

    "a tremendous simplification arises from the quasi - particle approximation .",
    "we do this in a fashion which , as will become evident in the following section , represents a self - consistent solution within a mean field approximation , i.e. we assume that the system consists of fermions that , in interacting only with the mean field , acquire a mass @xmath60 that depends on space and time , and which will be dynamically generated due to the breaking of the chiral symmetry of the underlying lagrangian .",

    "the basic problems concerning formulation of the transport theory can be studied within the framework of this simpler model , and the generalizations to include isospin are obvious .    from a perturbative expansion in the interaction picture , feynman - like rules can be constructed for the component functions of the matrix of green functions and their self - energies .",

    "one can see that this diagram and the convention given are in accordance with eq.([dyson ] ) .",
    "further examples follow in the evaluation of the self - energy in the following sections .",
    "before we evaluate the right hand sides of the transport and constraint equations , @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , we explain our strategy of a double expansion in powers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in general , an expansion in powers of the coupling",
    "constant is inappropriate for a strongly interacting theory . in our theory , eq.([lagrange ] ) , the relevant parameter is @xmath99 , which has a value close to two , and thus precludes a perturbative expansion .",
    "it is therefore customary to perform suitable partial summations of relevant diagrams . a perturbative expansion in the inverse number of colors",

    "note that @xmath123 and @xmath124 are scalars in spinor space , since the second term in both eqs.([hartreemm ] ) and ( [ hartreepp ] ) vanishes , in view of the quasiparticle approximation eq.([smp ] ) .",

    "we may now return to the transport and constraint equations and investigate their form . the only contribution from the right hand side of the transport and constraint equations , eqs.([full1 ] ) and ( [ full2 ] ) that is non - vanishing , stems from the advanced self - energy @xmath128 that occurs in @xmath129 in eq.([iamp ] ) .",

    "one sees therefore explicitly that the constraint equation ( [ hartreeconstraint ] ) has no multiplicative factors of @xmath1 , while the transport equation contains a simple power of @xmath1 throughout .",
    "this is a particular feature of the covariant approach to quantum transport theories which has been known for some time @xcite .",
    "the resulting set of equations ( [ vlasov ] ) and ( [ hatconstr ] ) , as is evident , forms the _ classical _ limit of the set of transport and constraint equations in the hartree approximation , since @xmath60 is a classical quantity .",
    "we note that eq.([hatconstr ] ) is trivially fulfilled for the quasiparticle approximation .",
    "in this section , we come to the main new aspects of the paper . here",
    "our task is to calculate the collisional self - energy for the model , and to manipulate the resulting equations in the semiclassical limit into the form of a boltzmann - like equation , thereby explicitly exposing the weaknesses of the quasiparticle approximation and explicitly showing the connection between the self - energies evaluated in this approach and the cross - section that appears in the transport equation . in particular , we wish to identify the feynman graphs that are present in the cross - section , and their relation to the graphs evaluated for the self - energy .",
    "note that some calculations that evaluate the collision term already exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases , in which the standard spinor decomposition is used @xcite , the connection to cross - sections is not evident and the resulting expressions are unwieldy and model - specific . in others , see for example @xcite , although it is somewhat simpler to connect the result to cross - sections , this has not been done in as general a fashion as will be presented here .    to be specific , we investigate self - energy graphs that contain two interaction lines , and which form the contributions to lowest order to the _ off - diagonal _ matrix elements of @xmath147 , and which are illustrated for @xmath109 in fig .",

    "the exchange graph of fig .",

    "formally , any arbitrary interaction will lead to a similar form as has been given in eq.([boltmann ] ) for the transport equation , and therein lies the generality of this calculation .",

    "one notes that it is _ intrinsically of one order less than _ the transport equation in terms of an @xmath1 expansion : the semiclassical form of eq.([full2 ] ) arises from @xmath112 structures .",

    "an additional correction to the mass could at most arise from @xmath241 but which represents @xmath149 corrections to @xmath242 calculated via eq.([gap ] ) . in the absence of this term , the constraint equation retains the form already given in eq.([hatconstr ] )",
    "in this paper , we have presented a general derivation for transport and constraint equations for a fermionic system from a canonical point of view along the lines of ref.@xcite .",

    "we have evaluated the lowest order self - energy term in the @xmath0 expansion , and constructed transport ( vlasov ) and constraint ( mass - shell ) equations .",
    "in addition , that one is working with a chiral model evidences itself in that the gap equation must be solved in addition to the transport and constraint equation emerges , and must be solved together with these .",
    "it is demonstrated explicitly that differing orders in @xmath1 are required for these two equations , the constraint equation being of order @xmath112 while the transport equation has order @xmath113 .",
    "we then examine a term of the next order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "we treat the simplest one that gives rise to a non - vanishing collision integral , and show explicitly that it is of order @xmath1 , and therefore is necessary for constructing a consistent transport equation . by the same token , it has no relevance for the constraint equation , for which only additional mass changes can occur .    in the derivation of the relativistic boltzmann equation ,",
    "we have gone to some trouble to indicate explicitly that the on - mass shell condition restricts the collision integral to contain only elastic scattering processes , and suppresses pair creation and annihilation amplitudes @xmath13 and also vacuum fluctuations that would otherwise be present .",
    "the derivation of the collision integral that we have given here is general for all relativistic two body interactions ",
    "minimal additional manipulations are required for a momentum dependent interaction .",
    "once again , the addition feature of the chiral symmetry manifests itself in that one has to solve a gap equation concomitantly .",
