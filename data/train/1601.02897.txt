    "life on earth is possible thanks to the hot sun and the cold sky .",
    "their temperature difference makes it possible to drive processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium by increasing the entropy elsewhere in the universe .",
    "absorbing photons from the sun at @xmath06000k and emitting about 20  times more photons at @xmath0300k to the cold sky makes the entropy balance sufficient to sustain complex processes in which entropy locally drops . as explained by ervin schrdinger in his book",
    "`` what is life?'',@xcite organisms feed on negative entropy .",
    "the hot sun and cold skies provide the earth with a great deal of negative entropy : in this way , the earth produces @xmath1 j / k of entropy each second.@xcite    here we play with the idea of a world upside down : the sun is cold and skies are `` hot '' .",
    "let us imagine a planet orbiting a black hole in a universe filled with background radiation .",
    "the inhabitants accept low - entropy energy from the sky and dispose waste heat to the black hole .",
    "the protagonists of the recent movie _ intersellar _ who want to colonize a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole _ gargantua _ might find these results vital ( for physical details of their trip and destination we recommend the book `` the science of interstellar''@xcite by kip thorne , the scientific consultant and an executive producer of the film ) .",
    "apart from the pedagogical value of simple thermodynamic exercises , these speculations might be relevant in the distant future when stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and die , and black holes may become dominant constituents of the entropy production processes.@xcite this kind of energetics might be useful until the expansion of the universe cools the cosmic background radiation below the temperature of the black hole hawking radiation .",
    "after that , the black hole becomes a net radiator and thus the nearby inhabitants might again live under a `` hot '' sun and cold sky .",
    "recently , the mechanism of extracting mechanical work of radiating black holes has been discussed;@xcite however , the focus here is on the not so distant future",
    ".    the considerations presented here can also be relevant for the discussion of the early stages of the universe : recently loeb@xcite suggested that a habitable epoch occurred when the universe was about 15 million years old and the background radiation had the temperature of 273300 k , allowing for rocky planets with liquid water chemistry on their surfaces .",
    "this suggestion was covered by the nature magazine@xcite mentioning also some criticism pointing out that the cold sky is thermodynamically as important for life as the hot sun .",
    "although there is no doubt that some source of negative entropy is necessary for life , the question remains what could be the source .",
    "the black - hole sun is an option to be discussed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : radiation ] general formulas for converting the incoming background radiation energy into useful work are discussed , in sec .",
    "[ sec : regimes ] two special regimes for the solid angle of the incoming radiation  large and small are studied , in sec .",
    "[ sec : circular ] the results for anisotropic radiation due to fast orbiting close to the black hole are presented , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyson ] a  dyson sphere encapsulating a black hole is considered , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] the conclusions are provided . details of the numerical computations of the temperature map of the sky for an observer orbiting a black hole are given in appendix  [ sec : computation ] .",
    "let us assume that heat exchange of the planet can occur radiatively by surface @xmath2 .",
    "the celestial sphere is divided into two parts : one is `` hot '' at temperature @xmath3 and the other cold , for simplicity at temperature of absolute zero .",
    "the zero - temperature black hole is a good approximation if hawking radiation@xcite is negligible .",
    "let the solid angles spanned by these two parts be @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 . to allow for the most efficient thermal energy exchange of the planet with the sky , we assume the whole planet to be covered with light concentration systems that project the celestial sphere into its images . we assume the numerical aperture of these devices approaching 1 which means that each point of the image is uniformly illuminated from the @xmath7 solid angle by rays coming from the object ( see fig .",
    "[ f - optics ] ) .",
    "this means that each part of the image can interact as a lambertian radiator with the corresponding part of the sky . in this way ,",
    "all rays coming from the hot part of the sky are projected to one part of the surface of the planet and rays from the cold part to another .",
    "let us denote the areas of these surfaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "a general theorem of ray optics says that a quantity called etendue for propagating light can not decrease ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . for a part of a beam propagating in directions within a solid angle @xmath11 across a surface element @xmath12",
    ", the element of etendue is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the refraction index of the medium and @xmath15 is the angle between the direction of propagation and the normal to @xmath12 .",
    "if the light propagates through non - absorbing non - scattering environment ( such as through our idealized optical systems ) , the etendue is conserved .",
    "this is analogous to the phase - space conservation in conservative systems according to the liouville theorem . for our scheme",
    "the consequence of etendue conservation is that @xmath16 the surfaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 then serve as the hot and cold terminals of heat engines .    without the idealization leading to eq .",
    "( [ omegas ] ) , one would have to take into account the fact that the cold terminal also interacts with objects at higher temperature which would decrease the efficiency of work production .",
    "let us note that in the photovoltaic industry one of the goals is the construction of light concentrators approaching the etendue limit ( see , e.g. , ref . )",
    ", so we assume that the advanced civilization inhabiting the planet under study has reached this goal .",
    "let the surfaces of the heat exchangers @xmath8 and @xmath9 be at temperatures @xmath17 and @xmath18 and let them serve as heat exchangers for a heat engine .",
    "the task is to find such @xmath17 and @xmath18 that the power of the heat engine is maximized .",
    "the procedure is analogous to the power optimization of irreversible engines as first studied by novikov@xcite and later independently by curzon and ahlborn@xcite ( for more general considerations see , e.g. , ref . ) .",

    "the resulting power is then @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total power of the incoming radiation , and @xmath41 is the efficiency with which the incoming radiation can be converted into useful work .",
    "even though eq .",
    "( [ eq - u ] ) as a quartic equation has an explicit solution , we solve it numerically and the result is used to find the dependence of the working temperatures @xmath17 , @xmath18 and of the efficiency @xmath42 on the hot - sky fraction @xmath43 , as shown in fig .  [ fbs1 ] .",

    "this gives @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , @xmath63km@xmath64 , so that the planet would radiate its waste thermal energy from an area comparable to rhode island . if the background radiation is at room temperature @xmath65300k as in the 15  million years old universe assumed in ref .",
    ", then @xmath66k , i.e. about @xmath67c . from eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) we find that useful work could then be obtained with power @xmath68gw .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude below the present world energy consumption , and six orders of magnitude below the power presently supplied to earth by sun .",
    "the situation goes much worse for today s two orders of magnitude colder background radiation at @xmath69k , resulting in eight orders smaller available useful power @xmath70910w .",
    "since @xmath42 increases with decreasing @xmath43 , to get as much power as possible , we should place the orbit as close to the black hole as possible .",
    "however , things get complicated there : the observer moves fast and relativistic effects become important .",
    "the absorbed radiation is doppler - shifted , as well as blue - shifted by falling to the black hole vicinity .",
    "the sky then ceases to be isothermal : the radiation comes hotter from the direction where the observer moves and colder from the rear . to get the precise picture of the sky , advanced numerical computations are necessary which are explained in appendix  [ sec : computation ] ; the results are in figs .",
    "[ fig : obloha ] and [ fig : vecko1 ] .",
    "having the temperature map of the sky , one can use segments of the sky with different temperature as heaters and apply another optimization to allocate to them various parts of the cooling area so as to get maximum power .",
    "we first consider motion along a timelike circular geodesic around a static , spherically symmetric black hole of a mass @xmath71 and schwarzschild radius @xmath72 , where @xmath73nm@xmath74kg@xmath26 is the gravitational constant and @xmath75 m/s is the speed of light .",
    "stable bound circular orbits of radius @xmath76 exist for @xmath77 ( see , e.g. , refs . and ) . in order to obtain the maximum power ,",
    "the innermost stable circular orbit at @xmath78 has been chosen .",
    "the resulting picture of the sky is in fig .",
    "[ fig : obloha](a ) .",
    "the shadow of the black hole covers 12.2% of the sky , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "if the temperature shifts were disregarded , eqs .",
    "( [ eq - u ] ) , ( [ pmax ] ) , and ( [ eq : eta ] ) would yield @xmath80% and @xmath81 . for an earth - size planet and background radiation at @xmath82k ,",
    "this would be @xmath8319mw .",
    "however , fast motion around the black hole makes parts of the sky warmer which brings some advantage . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : obloha](a ) , in the direction of motion the observer sees the temperature of the sky to be more than twice as large compared to what would see an observer at rest , far from the black hole ( the maximum blue shift being 2.12 ) .",
    "thus , the power available from this part of the sky can be more than @xmath84 times larger than without the blue shift",
    ". however , the hottest part of the sky is relatively small and the rest of the sky is colder . to find the total available power",
    ", we have divided the hot sky into 30 segments of equal temperature - span intervals .",
    "each segment then serves as a heater of a separate heat engine .",
    "since the power of each engine also depends on the cold area used for dumping its waste energy , one has to find the optimum allocation of the cold area to the individual engines to obtain a maximum total power .",
    "the result of the numerical optimization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plochy](a ) .",
    "the white bars are the areas of the hot segments which are given as the input data .",
    "the black bars are the areas of the corresponding cold segments obtained as the result of the optimization procedure .",
    "as can be seen , the optimum allocation assumes absorbing radiation from the 14 hottest segments of blueshifts above 1.4 .",
    "colder parts of the `` hot '' sky are not worth using as hot reservoirs .",
    "the resulting power is then @xmath85 , i.e. , one order of magnitude larger than the above estimate based on disregarding the frequency shifts . for an earth - size planet and background radiation at @xmath82",
    "k , this would be @xmath83 200 mw , i.e. , still rather low for a comfortable life of more than a few small towns .",
    "how can we come closer to the black hole so as to increase the cold sky proportion ?",
    "we were inspired by the movie _ interstellar _ where the characters come close to a fast - rotating giant black hole named _",
    "gargantua_. rotating black holes have stable circular orbits closer than @xmath86 . for gargantua ,",
    "the rotation parameter @xmath87 was extraordinarily large , @xmath88 , thus allowing the characters to enjoy extraordinarily strong relativistic effects close to the black hole.@xcite we have computed the results for two special cases of the orbit radius , @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obloha](b ) and [ fig : plochy](b ) ) and @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obloha](c ) and [ fig : vecko1 ] ) .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the orbit of _ miller s planet _ where the characters of interstellar spend three hours while 21 years pass on their base station which is sufficiently distant from the reach of gargantua s gravitational time shift .",
    "we can see that the shadow of the black hole becomes deformed and covers a large part of the observer s sky , including the direction of motion of the planet .",
    "nevertheless , the planet does not fall into the hole as it is dragged by its rotating gravitational field .",
    "the blue shift becomes much stronger , although in relatively small strips of the sky just above the shadow of the black hole in the direction of the planet motion . in the case of @xmath89",
    "the black hole covers 26 % of the sky and the maximum blue shift is 6.90 . upon using the same optimization procedure as in the preceding subsection , one finds the maximum attainable power to be @xmath91 . for an earth - size planet and background radiation at @xmath82",
    "k this would be @xmath83 6.7 gw , i.e. , enough for a small country .    the case of miller s planet with @xmath90 leads to extreme blue shifts , reaching up to 275,000 .",
    "the black hole covers 40 % of the sky and most of the radiation energy comes from a very narrow strip of a few arcseconds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vecko1 ] ) : our numerical results show that 99% of the energy comes from a strip of longitude span 2.3@xmath92 and latitude span 5.8@xmath92 .",
    "this size is comparable , e.g. , to the angular size of the planet neptune as seen from earth , with angular diameter @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the good news is that miller s planet enjoys small heating area regime ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : small - heating ] ) , meaning that most of the incoming radiation energy can be converted into useful work .",
    "the bad news for the visiting astronauts is that it is too much energy : the incoming flux density ( power per unit area perpendicular to the incoming radiation ) is @xmath94 kw / m@xmath64 , i.e. , about 300 times bigger than the solar constant .",
    "this value can be used to find the equilibrium temperature of a planet radiating its energy as a black body , @xmath95{\\phi/(4\\sigma)}\\approx   890^{\\circ}{\\rm c}$ ] .",
    "thus , the tidal waves observed on the planet might be , e.g. , of melted aluminum .",
    "moreover , the astronauts would be grilled by extreme - uv radiation .",
    "rather than assuming a planet , one could imagine a spherical shell enclosing the black hole . in 1960 ,",
    "freeman dyson speculated about possible signatures of intelligent extraterrestrial life that would build a structure around a star to capture all of its power.@xcite the waste thermal energy would be emitted as infrared radiation detectable by our observatories .",
    "we can turn this idea upside down : the inhabitants of the shell collect energy from the background radiation and send the waste thermal energy to the central black hole ( see fig .",
    "[ fdyson ] ) .    to explore the properties of such a scheme",
    ", we can use results of sec .",
    "[ sec : temperature - optimization ] , however , we assume that the total area is not fixed , but variable  determined by the radius of the dyson sphere @xmath96 .",
    "the sphere collects thermal energy from the outer area @xmath97 . with respect to the cold area",
    ", the situation is now simpler than in sec .",
    "[ sec : etendue ] since no light concentrators are necessary .",
    "the waste energy is radiated from the whole inner surface and the emitted photon either hits the black hole or is absorbed by another part of the inner surface .",
    "thus , the waste energy is absorbed by the shadow of the black hole which for a distant observer looks as a sphere of radius @xmath98 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 .",
    "the available power increases with increasing the dyson sphere radius , but up to a limit given by the fixed area of the heat sink . to calculate the limiting power , we assume @xmath100 and apply the results of subsection  [ subsec - bighot ] with @xmath101 . in this case the limiting power follows from eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the power of the background radiation that would be absorbed by the black hole if there were no dyson sphere .    as an illustration",
    ", we first assume a black hole with the mass of sun @xmath104 kg and temperature of the background radiation @xmath82k : the limiting power is @xmath105w .",
    "a supermassive black hole of the size of @xmath106 solar masses ( e.g. , the one in the center of our galaxy ) could give us @xmath107w , i.e. , about 200 times our present world energy consumption ( ignoring , however , the solar power harvested by the ecosystems ) .",
    "as the last example we consider the early universe background radiation with @xmath108k and a black hole with the apparent radius equal to the radius of sun , i.e. , @xmath109 m .",
    "this would lead to @xmath110w , which is three orders of magnitude above the present solar energy income of earth .",
    "for nonrotating black holes and the present temperature of the cosmic microwave background , the available power appears to be rather small for the living standards of our civilization .",
    "one might speculate of the distant future when hydrogen as the nuclear fuel for stars is exhausted and black holes together with background radiation become one of the few relevant sources of negative entropy .",
    "nevertheless , with the accelerated expansion of the universe the background radiation becomes colder so that even less power would be available .",
    "one might also speculate of hypothetical earth - like planets orbiting primordial black holes in the early stages of the universe filled with room - temperature background radiation .",
    "the available power budget becomes much more generous , however , one could hardly expect that organisms with necessary radiation - focusing equipment would stand a chance to evolve .",
    "the situation is different for fast rotating kerr black holes and planets on close orbits : gravitational and doppler shifts change the temperature map of the sky to allow for harvesting much more power .",
    "although the highly inspiring idea of the movie _ interstellar _ to explore planets orbiting kerr black holes is appealing , the conditions on miller s planet of the film prove to be rather harsh .",
    "this could be expected : since the time dilatation on the planet is about sixty thousand , the astronauts would receive signals from the distant outside arriving about sixty thousand times faster than emitted .",
    "such a frequency shift must apply also to the cosmic background , turning it much hotter .",
    "nevertheless , with a suitably chosen orbit slightly farther from gargantua , one can hope to find the sky conditions of the planet much closer to terrestrial .",
    "here we describe the computation of the temperature map of the observer s local sky .",
    "the relevant quantity is the relativistic frequency - ratio factor @xmath111 of ray bundles coming from distant universe and forming multiple relativistic images on the observer s celestial sphere.@xcite the frequency ratio between the locally observed and emitted frequencies of such ray bundles @xmath112 also corresponds to the ratio of the locally measured and emitted energies ( time - components of photon four - momentum ) . here and hereafter",
    ", the angle brackets in the index denote the local frame of the observer on the keplerian orbit .",
    "the source intensity divided by the third power of the frequency is conserved as a lorentz invariant.@xcite moreover , planck s law describes the black body radiation as having a spectral intensity in frequency proportional to @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the source temperature , @xmath115 the frequency , @xmath116 the planck constant and @xmath117 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "therefore , the black body spectrum of the background radiation will be locally observed as a black body spectrum with a temperature multiplied by the factor @xmath111 related to a particular ray bundle .",
    "naturally , the bolometric intensity amplification of ray bundles coming from distant universe is given by the fourth power of @xmath111 .",

    "assuming the photon energy is normalized to one , the remaining components of @xmath131 can be written as follows : @xmath132 one can obtain the coordinate covariant components of the four - momentum and related constants of motion ( [ constant_def ] ) by transforming the local components of @xmath131 , using appropriate frame tetrads of one - form by the relation @xmath133 then the frequency - ratio factor @xmath134 can be expressed as a function of constants of motion corresponding to the projection position on the observer s sky as @xmath135    the local tetrad of one - forms related to the observer on the corotating keplerian orbit around a kerr black hole can be obtained by the lorentz boost of zamo ( zero angular momentum observers , locally non - rotating observers)@xcite tetrad , which in the equatorial plane @xmath136 takes the form @xcite @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
