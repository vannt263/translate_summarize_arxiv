    "<S> for instance , decreasing the coupling @xmath48 to @xmath140 gev implies a decay width of about @xmath141 mev , which is on the low side of a typical hadronic decay ( as , for instance , the meson @xmath82 ) . in this case , @xmath142 gev@xmath143 , corresponding to a ratio @xmath144 which is still a sizable quantity . </S>",

    "<S> future studies should go beyond this scheme and include higher order terms , the first one being the ` sunset ' diagram , in which a particle @xmath23 is exchanged by the two particles @xmath40 circulating in the loop . </S>",
    "<S> the non - exponential nature of the decay does not depend on the truncation and would take place also when of higher order contributions are included . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical influence of the latter is , however , not expected to be large : higher order amplitudes are suppressed in the so - called large-@xmath158 approximation @xcite , which is a successful scheme for hadronic theories . </S>",

    "<S> two further natural outlooks of the present work are : ( i ) the study of short - time deviations from the exponential law in the context of renormalizable and non - renormalizable rqft lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the study of an unstable resonance decaying in two ( or more ) channels . both aim to a deeper understanding of decay processes in rqft and can find various applications in the context of strongly decaying hadrons and the other decay processes of the standard model .    </S>",
