    "fluctuations of , and correlations between , various experimental observables are believed to have the potential to reveal new physics .",
    "the growing interest in event - by - event fluctuations in strong interactions is motivated by expected anomalies in the vicinity of the onset of deconfinement @xcite and in the case when the expanding system goes through the transition line between quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas @xcite .",
    "in particular , a critical point of strongly interacting matter may be accompanied by a characteristic power - law pattern in fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that correlations across a large interval of rapidity arise from a color glass condensate @xcite . in recent years a wide range of experimental measurements of fluctuations of particle multiplicities @xcite , transverse momenta @xcite and multiplicity correlations in rapidity @xcite have been reported , leading to a lively discussion regarding their physical interpretation @xcite .    to get a reliable indication of new physics , it is important to note that most fluctuation and correlation observables are also sensitive to some `` baseline '' contributions that , nevertheless , can have non - trivial behaviour .",
    "for instance , most fluctuation and correlation observables are sensitive to the global characteristics ( e.g. the distribution of the number of colliding nucleons ) of a sample of events , which can in turn be non - trivially constrained by centrality bin construction @xcite .",
    "similarly , conservation laws can provide a `` trivial '' correlation between observables .",
    "the effects of such correlations depend on the _ scale _ at which these conservation laws become important .",
    "this scale could be anything , from microscopic ( mean free path , diffusion scale ) to the macroscopic size of the system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study these baseline correlations in a limiting case : that of a thermalized relativistic ideal ( no inter - particle interactions ) quantum gas for which we want to assess the importance of globally applied conservation laws for particle multiplicity fluctuations and correlations . in this case ,",
    "all observables are calculable simply using statistical mechanics techniques .",
    "such an approach has a long and distinguished history of calculating particle multiplicities in hadronic collisions  @xcite .    conventionally in statistical mechanics",
    "three standard ensembles are discussed ; the micro canonical ensemble ( mce ) , the canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) . in the mce",
    "one considers an ensemble of micro states with exactly fixed values of extensive conserved quantities ( energy , momentum , electric charge , etc . ) , with  a priori equal probabilities  of all micro states ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ce introduces the concept of temperature by introduction of an infinite thermal bath , which can exchange energy ( and momentum ) with the system .",
    "the gce introduces further chemical potentials by attaching the system under consideration to an infinite charge bath . only if the experimentally accessible system is only a small fraction of the total , and all parts",
    "have had the opportunity to mutually equilibrate , can the appropriate ensemble be the grand canonical one .    in the limit of very large volume and constant density ( the thermodynamic limit ) ,",
    "average values of intensive quantities are the same for all ensembles .",
    "however , even in this limit , these ensembles have different properties with respect to fluctuations and correlations @xcite . in the mce , energy and charge",
    "are exactly fixed . in the ce ,",
    "charge remains fixed , while energy is allowed to fluctuate about some average value .",
    "finally in the gce the requirement of exact charge conservation is dropped , too .",
    "one may also consider isobaric ensembles @xcite , or even more general  extended gaussian ensembles  @xcite .",
    "in previous articles @xcite it was shown that these differences mean that multiplicity fluctuations are ultimately ensemble specific .",
    "in this article we extend these results to fluctuations and correlations between particle multiplicities in limited bins of momentum space ( rapidity @xmath0 , transverse momentum @xmath1 and azimuthal angle @xmath2 ) . in section [ model ]",
    "we present details of the calculation of correlations within statistical mechanics .",
    "the following two sections present calculated fluctuations and correlations _ within _ the same momentum space bin for a stationary ( section [ staticsource ] ) and boosted ( section [ boostedsource ] ) system . in section [ longrangecorr ]",
    "we discuss long range correlations _ between _ momentum space bins .",
    "a discussion section [ summary ] , summarising our results and discussing their phenomenological implications within the context of heavy ion collisions , closes the paper .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we have shown that gce joint distributions of extensive quantities converge to multivariate normal distributions ( mnd ) in the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) .",
    "mce or ce multiplicity distributions could then be defined through conditional gce distributions . in general",
    "one may write for the multiplicity distribution @xmath3 of a ce with conserved electric charge @xmath4 : @xmath5 likewise one can write for the ce joint multiplicity distribution of particle species @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 the number of all micro states with electric charge @xmath4 , and multiplicities @xmath9 and @xmath10 of a system with temperature @xmath11 and volume @xmath12 is given by the ce partition function @xmath13 . similarly , @xmath14 denotes the number of micro states with fixed electric charge @xmath4 , but arbitrary multiplicities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for the same physical system .",
    "the strategy to calculate joint multiplicity distributions could thus be the following ( in principle also valid at finite volume ) : @xmath15 in order to get from eq.([p_one ] ) to eq.([p_three ] ) both canonical partition functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are divided by their gce counterpart @xmath16 and multiplied by @xmath17 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq.([p_two ] ) then equals the gce joint distribution @xmath18 , while the second term is just the inverse of the gce charge distribution @xmath19 .",
    "their ratio is the ( normalised ) gce conditional distribution of particle multiplicities @xmath9 and @xmath10 at fixed electric charge @xmath4 , @xmath20 , and equals the ce distribution @xmath21 at the same value of @xmath4 .",
    "this result is independent of the choice of chemical potential @xmath22 .",
    "the problem of finding a solution , or a ( large volume ) approximation , to the ce distribution @xmath21 is now turned into the problem of finding a solution or approximation to the gce distribution of multiplicities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , _ and _ charge @xmath4 .",
    "the role of chemical potential ( or lagrange multiplier ) @xmath22 will be discussed in section [ results ] .    from the assumption that the gce distribution @xmath18 converges to a tri - variate normal distribution",
    ", it also follows that the marginal distribution @xmath19 , as well as the conditional distribution @xmath23 , are normal distributions .",
    "hence , @xmath21 should have a good approximation in a bivariate normal distribution ( bnd ) in the large volume limit ( where the large particle numbers can be appropriately treated as continuous ) : @xmath24 \\bigg]~ , \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and : @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the variances of the marginal multiplicity distributions of particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the term @xmath30 is called the co - variance . additionally we define the scaled variance @xmath31 : @xmath32 which measures the width of the marginal distribution @xmath33 .",
    "lastly , @xmath34 is the correlation coefficient between particle numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution eq.([bnd ] ) hence has 5 parameters : mean values @xmath35 and @xmath36 , variances of marginal distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the correlation coefficient @xmath37 . loosely speaking ,",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath37 defines how the bnd , eq.([bnd ] ) , is tilted . in the case where @xmath38 , the distribution is elongated along the main diagonal , and measuring a larger ( smaller ) number of particles @xmath9 implies that it is also more likely to measure a larger ( smaller ) number of particles @xmath10 . the distribution is tilted the other way , if @xmath39 . in this case , multiplicities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are anti - correlated , and",
    "measuring @xmath40 implies that it is now more likely to measure @xmath41 .",
    "particle numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 are uncorrelated , if @xmath42 .    similarly , we define mce multiplicity distributions in terms of conditional gce distributions of extensive quantities . for this",
    "we will first find a suitable approximation to the gce joint distribution of extensive quantities ( electric charge , energy , momentum , particle number(s ) , etc . ) by fourier analysis of the gce partition function .",
    "the mce multiplicity distribution is then given by a slice along a surface of constant values of extensive quantities .",
    "the gce partition function of a relativistic gas with volume @xmath12 , local temperature @xmath43 , chemical potentials @xmath44 and collective four velocity @xmath45 reads ( the system four - temperature @xcite is @xmath46 ) : @xmath47~,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a sum over the single particle partition functions @xmath49 of all particle species ",
    "@xmath50  considered in the model : @xmath51 the single particle partition function @xmath49 of particle species ",
    "@xmath50  is given by a jttner distribution : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the components of the four momentum , @xmath54 are the components of the charge vector and @xmath55 is the degeneracy factor .",
    "the upper sign refers to fermi - dirac statistics ( fd ) , while the lower sign refers to bose - einstein statistics ( be ) .",
    "the case of maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) statistics is analogous .    in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems moving along the @xmath56-axis and use variables @xmath0 , @xmath1 and  @xmath2 . for a boost in rapidity of @xmath57 one finds for the four - velocity @xmath58 , the four - momentum @xmath59 and the integral measure @xmath60 , respectively : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of a particle of species @xmath50 .",
    "the single particle partition function eq.([psi ] ) now reads : @xmath63 for the examples in the following sections we chose a simple gas with only one conserved charge , denoted as a  pion gas  .",
    "the presented formulae are , however , also readily applicable to a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) .",
    "depending on what system one may want to study , one introduces chemical potentials @xmath64 and the  charge  vector @xmath65 of particle species @xmath50 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are the baryon , strangeness , and electric charge chemical potentials , respectively . @xmath70 and @xmath71 are particle - specific chemical potentials , and could denote out of chemical equilibrium multiplicities of species  a  and  b  , similar to phase space occupancy factors @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we neglect finite density effects , so @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are the baryonic charge , the strangeness , and the electric charge of particle species  @xmath50  .",
    "@xmath78 is the momentum space bin in which we wish to measure particle multiplicity .",
    "@xmath79 if the momentum vector of the particle is within the acceptance , @xmath80 if not .",
    "the charge vector @xmath65 also contains , to maintain a common notation for all particle species considered in eq.([psi ] ) , the  quantum ",
    "number @xmath81 .",
    "one may also be interested in correlations of , for instance , baryon number @xmath7 and strangeness @xmath82 , as e.g. in refs.@xcite . in this case , the @xmath83 particle , with @xmath84 , would be counted in groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 , provided the momentum vector is within the acceptance @xmath78 .      to introduce the generating function of the charge distribution @xmath85 in the gce we substitute in eq.([psi ] ) : @xmath86 the yet unnormalised joint probability distribution of extensive quantities @xmath87 in the gce is then given by the fourier transform of eq.([zgce ] ) after substitutions eqs.([subst_1],[subst_2 ] ) : @xmath88~.\\ ] ] more details of the calculation , in particular on the connection between the partition functions @xmath89 and the conventional version @xmath90 @xcite , can be found in appendix [ mcepf ] .",
    "depending on the system under consideration , we introduce the vector of extensive quantities @xmath91 and corresponding wick rotated fugacities @xmath92 : @xmath93 here @xmath7 is the baryon number , @xmath82 is the strangeness , and @xmath4 is the electric charge of the system .",
    "together with particle numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 this would be a 5-dimensional distribution in the case of a ce hrg . additionally for four - momentum conservation , yielding a 9-dimensional fourier",
    "transform eq.([curly ] ) for a mce hrg , we write : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the energy and @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are the components of the collective momentum of the system , while @xmath99 are the corresponding fugacities .",
    "the integrand of eq.([curly ] ) is sharply peaked at the origin @xmath100 in the tl @xcite .",
    "the main contribution therefore comes from a very small region . to see this ,",
    "a second derivative test can be done on the integrand of eq.([curly ] ) taking into account the first two terms of eq.([kappa ] ) .",
    "the limits of integration can hence be extended to @xmath101 .",
    "the distinction between discrete ( kronecker @xmath102 ) and continuous quantities ( dirac @xmath102 ) is not relevant for the tl approximation , where particle number is a continuous variable to be integrated over .",
    "we thus proceed by taylor expansion of eq.([psi ] ) . for this",
    "it is convenient to include everything into a common vector notation : @xmath103 the dimensionality of the vector @xmath104 is denoted as @xmath105 for a mce hrg .",
    "we now expand the cumulant generating function , @xmath106 , in a taylor series : @xmath107 where the elements of the cumulant tensor , @xmath108 , are defined by : @xmath109 generally cumulants are tensors of dimension @xmath110 and order @xmath111 .",

    "converge to gce values . to obtain a joint",
    "( two - dimensional ) particle multiplicity distribution one has to take a two - dimensional slice of the ( @xmath110 dimensional ) gce distribution , eq.([gce_dist ] ) , around the peak of the extensive quantities which one is considering fixed .",
    "the co - variance tensor @xmath129 will be spelled out explicitly and discussed in section [ boostedsource ] .",
    "further details of the calculation can be found in appendix [ ajd ] .",
    "let us start by discussing properties of a static thermal system .",
    "we want to measure joint distributions of multiplicities @xmath9 and @xmath10 in limited bins of momentum space ( of width @xmath136 for transverse momentum bins and @xmath137 for rapidity bins ) .",
    "depending on the size and positions of the bins , one finds different fluctuations and correlations .",
    "results will , in particular , be compared to the acceptance scaling approximation employed in @xcite , which assumes random observation of particles with a certain probability @xmath138 , regardless of particle momentum ( see also appendix [ accs ] ) .",
    "corresponding results for scaled variance in mb statistics can also be found in  @xcite .    for our examples we chose a gas with three degenerate massive particles ( with positive , negative and zero charge ) with mass @xmath139gev in three different statistics ( mb , fd , be ) . the momentum spectra",
    "are assumed to be ideal gce spectra , due to the large volume approximation . in fig.([boltzmannspectra ] ) transverse momentum and rapidity spectra are shown for mb statistics .",
    "be and fd statistics yield similar spectra , unless chemical potentials are large .",
    "we can then define bins by requiring each bin to hold the same fraction of the total multiplicity .",
    "note that in this case the width and position of bins @xmath136 and @xmath137 will strongly depend on the underlying momentum spectra .",
    "our examples , in particular the fd case , are a little academic in the sense that there is no fermion of this mass . in a hrg , often applied to heavy ion collisions , the lightest fermion is the nucleon for which quantum effects are probably negligible .    in fig.([staticsource_dodp ] ) we present the scaled variance @xmath140 , calculated using eq.([omega ] ) , within different transverse momentum bins @xmath136 ( _ left _ ) and rapidity bins @xmath137 ( _ right _ ) . the scaled variance in limited bins of momentum space is more sensitive to the choice of particle statistics than the spectra would suggest . be and fd effects are particularly strong in momentum space bins in which occupation numbers are large . hence , at the low momentum tail one finds suppression of fluctuations for fd and enhancement for be , while at the high momentum tail , one finds @xmath141 , fig.([staticsource_dodp ] ) ( _ left _ ) .",
    "the rapidity dependence , fig.([staticsource_dodp ] ) ( _ right _ ) , has a different behaviour .",
    "the reason is , that in any @xmath137 bin there is some contribution from a low @xmath1 tail of the differential momentum spectrum @xmath142 where quantum statistics effects are pronounced .",
    "this leads to a clear separation of the curves and one finds @xmath143 .",
    "in contrast to this , the @xmath144 integrated ( all particles observed ) scaled variance is rather insensitive to the choice of statistics @xcite ( unless chemical potentials are large ) .",
    "please note that there are in fact 3 different  acceptance scaling  lines in fig.([staticsource_dodp ] ) , which extrapolate the @xmath144 integrated scaled variance to limited acceptance .",
    "the differences are however very small and all 3 lines lie practically on top of each other .    in fig.([staticsource_drhodp ] ) we present the correlation coefficient @xmath37 , calculated using eq.([rho ] ) , between positively and negatively charged particles in transverse momentum bins @xmath136 ( _ left _ ) and rapidity bins @xmath137 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "the @xmath144 integrated correlation coefficient between positively and negatively charged particles would be @xmath145 in the ce and mce . in the gce",
    "it would be @xmath146 . in the mb",
    "ce it would not show any momentum space dependence and would always be @xmath147 . in the mce",
    "the situation is qualitatively different : in low momentum bins particles are positively correlated , while in high momentum bins they can even be anti - correlated .",
    "horizontal lines again indicate acceptance scaling ( appendix  [ accs ] ) .",
    "quantum effects for the correlation coefficient remain small as there is no explicit local ( quantum ) correlations between particles of different charge .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath136 dependence in figs.([staticsource_dodp],[staticsource_drhodp ] ) is a direct consequence of energy conservation .",
    "the @xmath137 dependence of @xmath140 and @xmath37 , however , is due to joint energy and longitudinal momentum ( @xmath148 ) conservation . disregarding @xmath148 conservation leads to a substantially milder @xmath137 dependence ,",
    "see fig.([staticsource_dxdy_nopz ] ) .",
    "this behaviour can be intuitively explained : in a low momentum bin it is comparatively easy to balance charge , as each individual particle carries little energy and momentum .",
    "in contrast to this , in a high momentum bin with , say an excess of positively charged particles , it is unfavourable to balance charge , as one would also have to have more than on average negatively charged particles , and each particle carries large energy and momentum .",
    "this leads to suppressed fluctuations and correlations in high momentum bins when compared to low momentum bins .    in a small mid - rapidity window , with @xmath149 , the effects of globally applied motional conservation laws cease to be important ( see fig.([staticsource_dodpt_vi ] ) ) .",
    "local correlations due to be and fd statistics begin to dominate , and mce deviations from the gce results , eq.([gce_estimate ] ) , are relevant only for the highest momentum bins . in be or fd",
    "statistics we find for vanishing bin size  ( @xmath150 ) : @xmath151 be and fd effects are strongest around mid - rapidity @xmath152 . mce calculations in fig.([staticsource_dodpt_vi ] ) are close to the gce estimate eq.([gce_estimate ] ) . in mb statistics",
    "we find only a weak @xmath136 dependence in a small mid - rapidity window .",
    "please note that the acceptance scaling procedure predicts a poisson distribution with @xmath153 and @xmath154 for all three statistics in the limit of very small acceptance .      as established a long time ago , in order to properly define the thermodynamics of a system with collective motion , the partition function needs to be lorentz invariant  @xcite .",
    "the expectation values of observables need hence to transform according to the lorentz transformation properties of these observables .",
    "in particular , the temperature @xmath11 is promoted to a four - vector @xmath155 ( combining local temperature with collective velocity ) .",
    "the entropy , as well as particle multiplicities , remain lorentz - scalars .",
    "these requirements are in general not satisfied unless momentum conservation is put on an equal status with energy conservation .",
    "if the system is described by a mce , then momentum should be conserved as well as energy @xcite .",
    "if the system is exchanging energy with a bath , the bath needs to exchange momentum as well . for ensemble averages , neglecting these rules and treating momentum differently from energy is safe as long as the system is close to the thermodynamic limit , since there ensembles become equivalent .",
    "the same is _ not _ true for fluctuation and correlation observables , which remain ensemble - specific @xcite .    for a system at rest",
    ", these requirements are not apparent since the net momentum is zero .",
    "statistical mechanics observables in a collectively moving system , however , lose their lorentz invariance , if this is not maintained in the definition of the partition function .    to illustrate this point",
    ", we consider the properties of a system moving along the @xmath56-axis with a collective velocity given by eq.([vec_u ] ) .",
    "the total energy of the fireball is then @xmath156 , while its total momentum is given by @xmath157 .",
    "the mass of the fireball in its rest frame is @xmath158 .",
    "the system 4-temperature is @xmath117 .",
    "local temperature and chemical potentials remain unchanged .",
    "we will use this section for a discussion of the second rank tensor ( or co - variance matrix ) @xmath129 , eq.([kappa ] ) .",
    "the second order cumulant @xmath129 , eq.([kappa ] ) , is given by the second derivatives of the cumulant generating function with respect to the fugacities .",
    "essentially this is the hessian matrix @xcite of the function eq.([psi ] ) , encoding the structure of its minima .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath159 are the variances of the gce distributions of extensive quantities @xmath160 .",
    "for example , @xmath161 measures the gce variance of the distribution of particle multiplicity of species @xmath6 , while @xmath162 denotes the gce electric charge fluctuations , etc .",
    "the off - diagonal @xmath163 elements give gce co - variances of two extensive quantities @xmath160 and @xmath164 .    for a boost along the @xmath56-axis",
    "the general co - variance matrix for a pion gas reads : @xmath165 off - diagonal elements correlating a globally conserved charge with one of the momenta , i.e. @xmath166 , as well as elements denoting correlations between different momenta , i.e. @xmath167 , are equal to zero due to antisymmetric momentum integrals . the values of elements correlating particle multiplicity and momenta , i.e. @xmath168 , depend strongly on the acceptance cuts applied . for fully phase space integrated ( @xmath169 )",
    "multiplicity fluctuations and correlations these elements are equal to @xmath146 , again due to antisymmetric momentum integrals .",
    "it is instructive to review the transformation properties of @xmath170 under the lorentz group : @xmath171 contains the correlations between 4-momenta @xmath172 and , in general , ( scalar ) conserved quantities and particle multiplicities @xmath173 .",
    "hence , the elements @xmath174 , i.e. @xmath175 , will transform as a tensor of rank 2 under lorentz transformations ; @xmath176 , i.e. @xmath177 , will transform as a vector ( the rapidity distribution will simply shift ) ; and the remaining @xmath178 will be scalars",
    ".    for a static system one finds for the co - variances @xmath179 .",
    "under these two conditions , a static system and full particle acceptance , the eigenvalues of the matrix eq.([matrix ] ) factorise , and momentum conservation can be shown to drop out of the calculation @xcite .    for a boost along the @xmath56-axis ( and arbitrary particle acceptance )",
    "it is the appearance of non - vanishing elements @xmath180 which make the determinant of the matrix @xmath129 , eq.([matrix ] ) , invariant against such a boost .",
    "please note that still @xmath181 .    in fig.([movingsource_dodp ] ) we show multiplicity fluctuations ( _ left _ ) and correlations ( _ right _ ) for a system with boost @xmath182 .",
    "the rapidity spectrum of fig.([boltzmannspectra ] ) ( _ right _ ) is simply shifted to the right by two units .",
    "the construction of the acceptance bins is done as before .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations and correlations within a bin transform as a vector ( i.e. , its @xmath56 component shifts in rapidity ) as inferred from their lorentz - transformation properties , provided both energy _ and _ momentum along the boost direction are conserved .",
    "this last point deserves attention because usually ( starting from @xcite ) micro canonical calculations only conserve energy and _ not _ momentum .",
    "imposing exact conservation for energy , and only average conservation of momentum will make the system non - lorentz invariant , since in a different frame from the co - moving one energy and momentum will mix , resulting in micro state - by - micro state fluctuations in _ both _ momentum and energyfunction , that stays a @xmath183function under all lorentz - transformations .",
    "hence , unlike what happens in a cooper - frye freeze - out , energy - momentum and space - time do _ not _ mix in the partition function .",
    "together with the constraint from the particle dispersion relations , this means that different components of the 4-momentum need to be treated by the same ensemble , as explicitly demonstrated in this section . ] .",
    "this situation is explicitly shown in fig.([movingsource_dodp_nopz ] ) . here , we have calculated multiplicity fluctuations and correlations in the same system as in fig.([movingsource_dodp ] ) , but with exact conservation of _ only _ energy ( and charge ) . in the co - moving frame of the system ,",
    "the fluctuations and correlations are identical to fig.([staticsource_dxdy_nopz ] ) .",
    "when the system is boosted , however , the distribution changes ( not only by a shift in rapidity , as required by lorentz - invariance ) , and loses its symmetry around the system s average boost .",
    "this last effect can be understood from the fact that momentum does not have to be conserved event by event , but energy does .",
    "it is easier , therefore , to create a particle with less rapidity than average ( having less momentum than the boost , and parametrically less energy ) than with more rapidity than average ( having more momentum than the boost , and parametrically more energy ) and still conserve energy overall .",
    "this leads to suppressed multiplicity fluctuations and a negative correlation coefficient for rapidity bins in the forward direction in comparison to rapidity bins in the backward direction . in fig.([movingsource_dodp ] ) , where the system also needs to conserve momentum exactly , this enhancement is balanced by the fact that it will be more difficult to conserve momentum when particles having less momentum than the boost are created .    a situation such as that in fig.([movingsource_dodp_nopz ] )",
    "is impossible to be realized physically . it _ could _",
    ", however , be realized within `` system in a box''-type calculations with non - equilibrium models : e.g. , a transport model inside an infinitely heavy box ( that absorbs momentum but not energy event - by - event ) would end up exhibiting micro canonical correlations similar to those in fig.([movingsource_dodp_nopz ] ) . a similar box with  periodic ",
    "walls , however , would conserve energy as well as momentum inside the box , and should therefore behave as in fig.([movingsource_dodp ] ) .",
    "thus , correlations within boosted sources provide a sensitive test of the lorentz - invariance of such transport models .",
    "`` long range correlations '' between bins well disconnected in momentum have been suggested to arise from dynamical processes .",
    "examples include color glass condensate  @xcite , droplet formation driven hadronization @xcite , and phase transitions within a percolation - type mechanism @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow measurements , widely believed to signify the production of a liquid at rhic @xcite , are also , ultimately , correlations between particles disconnected in phase space ( here , the azimuthal angle ) .",
    "as we will show , however , conservation laws will also introduce such correlations between any two ( connected or not ) distinct regions of momentum space .",
    "no dynamical effects are taken into consideration ( only an isotropic thermal system ) .",
    "let us first consider correlations between the multiplicities of particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 , within two bins centered around @xmath184 and @xmath185 , with ( constant ) widths @xmath186 .",
    "in fig.([fb_corr ] ) ( _ left _ )",
    "we show the correlation coefficient , calculated using eq.([rho ] ) , between positive and negative particles as a function of @xmath184 and @xmath185 . in fig.([fb_corr ] ) ( _ right _ ) we show the correlation coefficient between like - charge , unlike - charge , and all charged particles as a function of @xmath187    energy conservation always leads to anti - correlation between different momentum space bins .",
    "charge conservation leads to a positive correlation of unlike charged particles and anti - correlation of like - sign particles .",
    "longitudinal momentum conservation , however , is responsible for the structure visible in fig.([fb_corr])(_left _ ) . having a small ( large ) number of particles in a bin with positive average longitudinal momentum , leads to a larger ( smaller ) number of particles in a bin with different but also positive @xmath148 , ( blue dips ) .",
    "this makes also a state with smaller ( larger ) particle number with opposite average longitudinal momentum @xmath188 more likely ( red hills ) . at large values of @xmath184 the correlation coefficient @xmath189 for any @xmath185 , because the yield @xmath35 in @xmath190 is asymptotically vanishing .    in fig.([fb_corr ] ) ( _ right _ ) we show the correlation coefficient along the diagonal from top left to bottom right as a function of separation . unlike - sign particles are positively correlated . like - sign and",
    "all charged particles are negatively correlated at small separation @xmath191 . for large separation",
    "the correlation becomes asymptotically zero , because the yield is zero .",
    "however , please note that in particular @xmath192 at large @xmath191 .",
    "@xmath148 conservation is dominant .",
    "disregarding @xmath148 conservation would destroy the particular structure in fig.([fb_corr ] ) ( _ left _ ) and lead to a single peak at the origin . the correlation would then be insensitive to the momentum direction , and only be sensitive to the energy content of a bin @xmath137 .",
    "the observables in fig.([fb_corr ] ) transform under boosts ( @xmath193 ) , provided momentum along the boost axis is exactly conserved .",
    "angular correlations also arise due to conservation of transverse momenta @xmath194 and @xmath195 . in fig.([angular_corr ] ) we show the correlation coefficient between particles in different @xmath196 bins . the flat angular spectrum",
    "@xmath197 has been divided into 10 equal size bins and the correlation coefficient is presented as a function of separation of the centers of the corresponding bins .",
    "to explain fig.([angular_corr ] ) we note firstly that when disregarding exact conservation of @xmath194 and @xmath195 the correlation coefficients are insensitive to the distance @xmath198 of any two bins .",
    "only the correlations due to energy and charge conservation affect the result .",
    "charge conservation leads to correlation of unlike - sign particles and to anti - correlation of like - sign particles .",
    "energy conservation always anti - correlates multiplicities in two bins . for @xmath199",
    "the effect of charge conservation cancels for a neutral system , however , effects of energy - momentum conservation are stronger , as a larger number of particles ( hence a larger part of the total system ) is observed .",
    "conservation of transverse momenta @xmath194 and @xmath195 is now responsible for the @xmath198 dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "the line of arguments is similar to the ones before : observing a larger ( smaller ) number of particles in some bin at @xmath200 implies that , in order to balance momenta @xmath201 , one should also observe a larger ( smaller ) number of particles in the opposite direction @xmath202 . a larger ( smaller ) number of particles in a bin with @xmath203 would do little to help to balance momentum , but conflict with energy conservation .",
    "we have presented multiplicity fluctuations and correlations in limited momentum bins for ideal relativistic gases in the mce in the thermodynamic limit . for our examples we chose a gas with three degenerate massive particles ( positive , negative , neutral ) in three different statistics ( maxwell - boltzmann , fermi - dirac , bose - einstein ) .    for the width of multiplicity distributions in limited bins of momentum space",
    "a simple and intuitive picture emerges . in the maxwell - boltzmann approximation one",
    "finds a wider distribution for momentum bins with low average momentum when compared to bins with higher average momentum , but same average particle number .",
    "this qualitative behaviour is a direct consequence of energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the results in fermi - dirac and bose - einstein statistics , furthermore , show pronounced effects at the low momentum tail of the spectrum .",
    "the correlation coefficient additionally shows a similar qualitative behaviour . in bins with low average momentum the correlation coefficient between positively and negatively charged particles is indeed positive , as one would expect from charge conservation .",
    "however , in bins with large average momentum the effects of joint energy and momentum conservation can lead to anti - correlated distributions of unlike - charged particles .    for boosted systems we found that the role of exactly imposed motional conservation laws is particularly important .",
    "fluctuations and correlations transform under boosts , provided momentum conservation along the boost direction is taken into account .",
    "this ensures , in particular , that they become boost invariant if the underlying system is boost - invariant .",
    "lastly , we found that even in the thermodynamic limit long range correlations between disconnected regions in momentum space prevail .",
    "multiplicities in different rapidity bins , as well as different bins in azimuth , have a non - zero correlation coefficient .",
    "it is premature to use the model presented here for a _ quantitative _ comparison with experimental data .",
    "firstly , the inclusion of resonances will provide important corrections .",
    "these can be implemented within our model using monte - carlo techniques , and will be the subject of a subsequent work @xcite .",
    "an additional effect missing here that could change results qualitatively is longitudinal flow .",
    "it can be seen , `` by symmetry '' , that correlations and fluctuations in a perfectly boost - invariant fluid would be , just like other physical observables , independent of rapidity . reconciling this with the calculations in sections",
    "[ staticsource ] and [ boostedsource ] would require calculating correlations of many independent sources , each centered around a particular rapidity .",
    "it is however _ not _ currently clear whether experimental data , even at highest rhic and lhc energies at mid - rapidity , approximates this limit . at lower sps energies , measurements  @xcite of the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of particle multiplicity fluctuations show qualitatively similar results to those of our calculations (",
    "it should be noted that , as shown in @xcite , this behaviour for fluctuations also arises in molecular dynamics models , where conservation laws are included but equilibrium is not assumed ) .",
    "it has long been noticed @xcite that many observables binned in rapidity obey `` universal fragmentation '' , suggesting that a `` landau hydrodynamics '' , with negligible initial longitudinal flow even away from mid - rapidity , might be more appropriate than boost - invariance to describe the initial state , even at ultra - relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "experimentally , these measurements might be non - trivial since the size of the bins must be large enough for conservation laws to have an effect , but , since rhic has large - acceptance data @xcite and the lhc is planning a larger - acceptance detector @xcite , they are in principle possible .",
    "if boost - invariance is not really there , then correlations and fluctuations binned by rapidity should be qualitatively similar to those calculated in section [ staticsource ] even at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we therefore suggest the experimental measurement of such fluctuations ( figs.([staticsource_dodp],[staticsource_drhodp ] ) ( _ right _ ) ) at these energies as an experimental probe of the degree of boost - invariance of the system .",
    "similarly , transverse flow should not change the correlation and fluctuations within limited transverse momentum bins ( the left panels of figs.([staticsource_dodp],[staticsource_drhodp ] ) ) beyond a trivial shift _",
    "provided _ there are no significant fluctuations in collective flow observables .",
    "these fluctuations are widely expected to arise in an imperfect fluid @xcite , but have remarkably not been observed , for example , in elliptic flow measurements @xcite .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that a measurement of @xmath1 binned fluctuations and correlations could provide a qualitative way to assess the magnitude of event - by - event flow observables wrt to the thermal observables presented here .",
    "finally , effects of the sort studied in section [ longrangecorr ] will surely appear in any measurement looking for correlations across momentum space .",
    "long range rapidity correlations have , in particular , been advocated as a signature of new physics @xcite .",
    "our work shows that correlations due to conservation laws actually cover as wide a range in rapidity as those measured in @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the correlations , however , is significantly ( as much as an order of magnitude ) lower than either the experimental result or any reasonable `` new physics '' , suggesting that the origin of the experimentally observed correlations lies elsewhere . in particular , correlations induced by initial state geometry are considerably larger than those induced by conservation laws , as a comparison between fig.([fb_corr ] ) and the results in @xcite will show . nevertheless , energy - momentum conservation does trigger correlations across a wide rapidity interval , and , as shown in @xcite , qualitatively the magnitude of these correlations is independent of the degree of equilibration of the system , so their presence in experimental data is very plausible . perhaps complementing the rapidity correlations with azimuthal correlation measurements , such as those in fig.([angular_corr ] ) , might clarify their role , although the latter are particularly susceptible to `` non - trivial '' physics contributions , such as jet pairs and elliptic flow .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented microcanonical ensemble calculations of correlation and fluctuation observables within and across bins within a range of rapidity and transverse momenta .",
    "the calculations presented here provide _ qualitative _ effects affecting multiplicity fluctuations and correlations .",
    "these effects arise solely from statistical mechanics and conservation laws .",
    "it will be extremely important to see whether these qualitative effects are visible in further experimental measurements of the momentum dependence of multiplicity fluctuations and correlations .",
    "if so , these effects might well be of similar magnitude to the signals for new physics . disentangling them from dynamical correlations",
    "will then be an important , and likely non - trivial task .",
