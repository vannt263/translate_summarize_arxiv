    "local helioseismology has become an important tool to study solar interior structures and dynamics .",
    "significant progress has been made recently , e.g. , deriving subsurface structures and flow fields of sunspots @xcite , inferring large scale subsurface flows @xcite , and imaging solar far side active regions @xcite , by use of different local helioseismological techniques , including time - distance helioseismology , ring - diagram analysis , acoustic imaging and helioseismic holography . meanwhile , with the advancement of scientific investigations , specific cautions are also taken on interpreting local helioseismology observations , which include efforts to refine time - distance measurement @xcite , to improve accuracy of modeling and interpreting observations @xcite , and to address some potential systematic effects in measurements , such as `` inclined magnetic field effect '' @xcite , `` showerglass effect '' @xcite , and `` masking effect '' caused by acoustic power deficit in sunspots @xcite .    both the inclined magnetic field effect and showerglass effect were first observed by use of the helioseismic holography technique . by measuring phase shifts obtained from the so - called `` local control correlation '' phase - sensitive holography @xcite inside sunspot penumbra when the sunspot was at different locations on the solar disk , @xcite found that ingression acoustic phase shifts , which correspond to the ingoing travel times in time - distance measurement , vary with different viewing angles .",
    "they suggested that these phase shifts might be due to the inclination of magnetic field lines relative to the line - of - sight direction .",
    "they argued that the inclined magnetic field might cause an elliptic photospheric motion , resulting in variations of the observed magnetoacoustic wave with the viewing angle with respect to the field direction .",
    "the other , showerglass effect , has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that the surface magnetic field may shift the phases of acoustic waves , and that the phase shifts function as a sort of acoustic showerglass that impairs the coherence of seismic waves and degrades images of subsurface anomalies .",
    "unlike the inclined magnetic field effect , which is caused by the inclination of magnetic field and most noticeable in sunspot penumbra close to the solar limb , the showerglass effect exists in wherever magnetic field is present at solar surface .",
    "although these observational effects were found by the helioseismic holography technique , we are interested to know whether the similar effects exist in time - distance measurements , and how they affect the inversion results from time - distance helioseismology . in this paper",
    ", we measure the inclined magnetic field effect by the use of the time - distance technique on different types of observations of solar oscillations , including mdi dopplergrams , intensitygrams and line - depth data @xcite , and also perform inversions for one selected active region to examine how this effect may affect inverted interior structures .",
    "these results are presented in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "we then present in section  [ sec3 ] the showerglass effect measurements , and in section  [ sec4 ] the second - skip travel times measured from annulus - annulus cross - correlations , which demonstrate that oscillation signals inside sunspots do not introduce significant extra phase shifts to time - distance measurements .",
    "discussions and conclusions follow in section  [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] .",
    "however , it should be borne in mind that the motivation of this paper is not to compare directly measurements from time - distance and helioseismic holography techniques , but to assess how some measurement effects that were reported from holography studies affect our typical time - distance measurements .",
    "to study the inclined magnetic field effect , we select the same sunspot in active region ar9026 as studied by @xcite during the similar observational periods",
    ". this sunspot appeared from the solar east limb on june 2 , 2000 at the latitude of @xmath0 in the northern hemisphere .",
    "our time - distance analysis is different from the holography analysis @xcite in several aspects , including observational duration , annulus radius and width ( or pupil size ) , frequency bands selection , and the use of phase - speed filtering .",
    "time - distance helioseismology employs phase - speed filtering procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is designed to keep all the acoustic waves that have the same first bounce distances and similar wave propagation speed ( therefore , traveling similar distances with similar times ) , and filter out all other acoustic waves . applying phase - speed filtering",
    "makes the time - distance analysis with short annulus radius and short annulus width possible , and significantly improves the signal to noise ratio of time - distance measurement .",
    "we selected three dates for analysis , and for each date , only observations of the first 512 minutes of the day are used .",
    "the @xmath1-modes frequency range covers approximately @xmath2 mhz after filtering , though the acoustic power peaks at approximately @xmath3 mhz .",
    "the acoustic travel times are measured between a central point and the surrounding annulus , with the annulus size range of @xmath4 mm .",
    "following the data analysis procedure described by @xcite , we compute the acoustic travel times inside the sunspot penumbra for the selected observation periods .",
    "figure  [ fg1 ] presents the mean travel times , which are averages of the outgoing and ingoing travel times , as functions of the penumbral azimuthal angle for different dates .",
    "the azimuthal angle starts from @xmath5 in the west of the sunspot umbra center , and increases counter - clockwise inside the sunspot penumbra .",
    "basically , the mean acoustic travel times are longer inside the sunspot penumbra than these in the quiet sun for this specific annulus range that we use .",
    "it can be found that for each date , the mean travel times vary with the azimuthal angle , with a magnitude of approximately 0.2 minutes relative to the average value inside penumbra . additionally , the angular dependence of the variations of the mean travel times is different for different dates , which implies that such variations are not caused by the properties of the sunspot itself , but by some systematic effects in the helioseismic measurements .",
    "more examinations of different sunspots confirmed that such variations are systematic measurement effects that are related to the projection effect , rather than caused by the real variations in solar structures or dynamics . comparing figure  [ fg1 ] with figure  2 in @xcite",
    ", one can tell that the travel time variation trends are similar for the june 7 and 10 measurements , except that the variation magnitude in our measurement is approximately 12 sec , substantially smaller than that from the holography measurement , which is of the order of 30 sec .",
    "perhaps , the use of different measurement annulus ( or pupil ) sizes , phase - speed filtering and different acoustic frequencies in these techniques may have caused such differences .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how this measurement effect affects our inversion results for sound - speed structures beneath the sunspot @xcite .",
    "since the inversion procedure involves integration over large areas of different annuli and over a large depth range , as well as averaging and smoothing , it is not obvious how much this systematic measurement effect would change the inversion results . following the inversion procedures described in @xcite and @xcite , we derive the subsurface sound - speed variation structures of this sunspot from the travel time measurements for a total of 11 annuli , including the ones shown in figure  [ fg1 ] .",
    "inversions for the june 3 , 2000 observation are not performed because the sunspot was located too close to the solar east limb .",
    "the typical sound - speed variation structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be seen in figure  [ fg2 ] , with negative sound - speed variations close to the solar surface and positive sound - speed variations below 5.0 mm or so . despite the evolutionary sunspot structure changes that might have occurred from june 7 to june 10 ,",
    "some systematic changes are still visible .",
    "it can be found that close to the surface , at the depth of 1.5 mm , the locations of negative sound - speed variations do not coincide with the center of sunspot umbra , but slightly off from the umbra towards the direction of the solar disk center ; and additionally , some positive sound - speed variations are found on the other side of the umbra opposite to the disk center .",
    "such changes are presumably caused by the systematic inclined magnetic field effect .",
    "however , at the depth of 5.0 mm when the sound - speed variations become positive , locations of major variations are coincident with the locations of sunspot , including both umbra and penumbra .",
    "even deeper , at the depth of 11.0 mm , the structures of sound - speed variations do not change much , but again , locations may slightly be off the center and move towards the direction of solar disk center .",
    "overall , when the sunspot was located on either side of the disk center , and the inclined angles of magnetic field lines were different , but the inverted interior structures of the sunspot remain largely unchanged except near the solar surface .",
    "mdi sometimes has simultaneous dopplergram and continuum intensitygram observations , or simultaneous dopplergram and line - depth observations , both with one minute cadence @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the inclination of the magnetic field may affect the time - distance results obtained from the intensitygram and line - depth solar oscillation data .",
    "we select a sunspot with simultaneous mdi high resolution dopplergram and continuum intensitygram observations .",
    "this sunspot was located inside active region ar8243 , and the selected 512-minute observation period is from 17:00ut , june 18 to 01:31ut , june 19 , 1998 , when the active region was passing right above the solar disk center , at a latitude of approximately @xmath6n .",
    "it is well known that the acoustic power computed from solar intensitygrams is less stronger than that computed from dopplergrams , thus time - distance measurements from intensitygrams are noisier ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , although the travel time maps computed from the intensitygrams are noisier for short distances ( small annuli ) , the signatures of active regions and supergranulations are still clear , and such measurements are sufficiently good to perform the analysis similar to section  [ sec2p1 ] in order to evaluate travel time variations with the azimuthal angle inside the sunspot penumbra .",
    "figure  [ fg3 ] shows the measurement results .",
    "the averages of the mean travel times inside the sunspot penumbra measured from the two datasets are different , so that the travel time measured from the continuum intensitygrams about 0.5 minutes longer than that the corresponding travel times from the dopplergrams .",
    "this is probably caused by the different acoustic power distributions in the @xmath7 diagrams of these two kinds of observations , which is well known in helioseismology .",
    "for example , the ratios of acoustic powers in higher frequency and lower frequency are different , and power spectra from dopplergrams and intensitygrams display different line asymmetries @xcite .",
    "it is still not very clear what causes these differences , but it was suggested that these might be related to the differences in the correlated components of the background noises @xcite . the techniques to correct such travel time offset is currently under investigation , and the main idea is to manipulate the power spectra from intensitygrams to match the spectra from dopplergrams before computing acoustic travel times from the time - distance technique .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fg3 ] shows that the acoustic travel times measured from dopplergrams have a cyclic 0.2 minutes azimuthal variations , while the travel times from intensitygrams are basically invariant with the azimuthal angle , and that the small variation of about 0.05 minutes are likely related to the real structure variations or intensitygram noises , rather than the systematic effects caused by the inclined magnetic field .",
    "we select another sunspot with simultaneous mdi full - disk resolution dopplergram and line - depth observations .",
    "this sunspot was located inside active region ar7973 , and the selected 512-minute analysis period was from 12:00ut to 20:31ut , june 25 , 1996 , when the sunspot was approximately @xmath8 past the central meridian and @xmath9 above the solar equator .",
    "similar to the results from intensitygrams , the acoustic power computed from the line - depth data is also weaker than that computed from dopplergrams , and the time - distance results are also noisier .",
    "but it is also true that the line - depth data give a stronger acoustic power signal than the intensitygrams , and also give less noisier time - distance results compared to the intensitygrams .",
    "the time - distance measurements performed over such data are usable to evaluate travel time variations inside sunspot penumbra .",
    "figure  [ fg4 ] shows the results .",
    "the average mean travel time measured from the mdi line - depth data are approximately 0.4 minutes longer than that measured from the dopplergrams , due to the similar reasons as for the intensitygrams .",
    "again , the acoustic travel times measured from the dopplergrams of this sunspot show 0.2 minutes variations with the azimuth , but the travel times measured from the line - depth data do not have such significant systematic variations .",
    "the showerglass effect introduced in helioseismic holography measurements is exhibited as incoherent phase shifts of acoustic waves in active regions , likely due to the presence of the surface magnetic field .",
    "one major characteristic of this effect is that the amount of phase shifts , measured from the so - called `` local ingression and egression control correlations '' , vary with magnetic field strength , and in particular , the local ingression and egression control correlations exhibit asymmetric phase shifts when magnetic field strength is strong ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "it is quite clear that the local control experiments used in helioseismic holography measurements are a similar technique to measuring acoustic travel times by time - distance helioseismology surface focusing scheme .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to carry out a similar analysis by use of time - distance technique , and investigate how the presence of magnetic field may affect time - distance measurements in active regions .",
    "figure  [ fg5 ] shows our measurements from ar 8243 , the same dopplergram data as doing dopplergram and intensitygram comparison analysis in section  [ sec2p2 ] , by use of two different annulus ranges . a significant difference between our time - distance measurements and helioseismic holography measurements @xcite is that phase - speed filtering is applied in our time - distance analysis while holography uses only frequency filtering .",
    "also , very short annulus widths ( usually a few megameters ) are used in the time - distance analysis while holography often uses very large pupil widths ( approximately @xmath10 mm ) . comparing figure  [ fg5 ] with figure  7 in @xcite",
    ", one can find that the major similarities are that the travel times ( or phase shifts ) vary with the magnetic field strength , and that the outgoing and ingoing acoustic waves exhibit asymmetric travel times when the magnetic field strength is large , for both short and long annuli .",
    "especially , the outgoing and ingoing travel times are very asymmetric in figure  [ fg5]b .",
    "however , the largest travel time differences relative to the quiet sun are approximately 0.3 minutes in figure  [ fg5]a and 1.0 minute in figure  [ fg5]b , and these numbers are significantly different from the result in @xcite , which is approximately @xmath11 in phase shift , i.e. , 1.7 minutes .",
    "once again , these differences may be caused by the different frequency bands , filtering technique and very different sizes of annulus ( or pupil ) .",
    "it is very important to note that the magnitude and sign of the travel time variations are different for different travel distances .",
    "if travel time variations are caused by the surface magnetism , then one may expect that these variations do not significantly change with travel distances .",
    "therefore , the very different behaviors of the acoustic travel times for different measurement annuli indicate that a large fraction of the observed travel time deviations from the mean travel time in the quiet sun is due to the interior structures and dynamics of active regions .",
    "the observed deviations of the travel times in sunspots compared to the travel times in the quiet regions are explained as changes in the sound - speed structures of sunspots with depths , and the asymmetry in the outgoing and ingoing travel times is explained as the advection effect due to subphotospheric flows .",
    "the arguments that all travel time deviations from 0 are caused by the showerglass effect , and that all such deviations be removed from acoustic signals are not justified .",
    "such corrections will substantially underestimate sound - speed variations and flow velocities in the sunspot interior .",
    "how and how much the surface magnetism affects the acoustic travel times are definitely worth more studies , and that will likely rely on numerical modelings .",
    "one important observation that supports the existence of showerglass effect is that the phase shift , measured from helioseismic holography ingression and egression correlations ( corresponding to double - skip travel time measurements of time - distance helioseismology ) when the holography focus plane is at the solar surface and located inside a sunspot , is different from the sum of phase shifts measured from the local ingression and egression control correlations .",
    "measurements using a second - skip time - distance technique showed similar discrepancies @xcite .",
    "these observations supported the argument that acoustic signals observed inside sunspot may cause outgoing and ingoing travel time asymmetries , or introduce uncertainties to time - distance measured travel times .    to avoid the use of pixels located inside the sunspot region as the central point in traditional time - distance measurement",
    "( refer to figure  [ fg6 ] ) , @xcite used the second - skip time - distance measurements and performed inversions , from which they obtained sound - speed perturbations beneath sunspots similar to the results obtained from the traditional time - distance measurements in the deep interior @xcite . a disagreement between their second",
    "- skip analysis with the traditional one - skip analysis near the surface may be due to the lack of near surface measurements when performing second - skip measurements . however , their measurements employed a scheme of center - double skip annulus cross - correlation ( by cross - correlating signals at the center with signals averaged from an annulus around that center but with two acoustic skips ) , rather than the scheme of annulus - annulus cross - correlation employed by @xcite , although both schemes measure second - skip acoustic travel times .",
    "we employ a similar scheme of annulus - annulus cross - correlation as used by @xcite by dividing one circular annulus into two semi - annuli and cross - correlating acoustic signals inside these two semi - annuli , as illustrated in figure  [ fg6 ] . after applying the phase - speed filtering , commonly used in time - distance measurements , to the data of ar8243 ( same dopplergram dataset as used in section  [ sec2p2 ] )",
    ", we have measured the second - skip travel times for an annulus with the inner radius of 32.2 mm and the outer radius of 41.3 mm , both of which are larger than the distance from the sunspot umbra center to the boundary of sunspot penumbra .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out here , that the oscillation power reduction ( `` masking '' ) effect has been corrected based on the acoustic power map of the studied region @xcite before measuring the acoustic travel times .",
    "in addition to this second - skip experiment , another useful experiment is to compute acoustic travel times through the annulus - annulus cross - correlations , but without using oscillation signals inside the entire sunspot region .",
    "this experiment is feasible because the mean signals for computing cross - correlations are averaged from two semi - annuli , which are not completely inside the sunspot , where data are not used , for all cases that are computed in this paper .",
    "however , such experiment can not be done for the traditional center - annulus computations , because pixels inside sunspots must be used as central points in these computations .",
    "figure  [ fg7 ] displays our travel time measurements from the traditional single - skip center - annulus correlations , the second - skip annulus - annulus correlations , and the second - skip annulus - annulus correlations after zeroing out signals inside the sunspot .",
    "it is quite clear that , from figure  [ fg7]a and b , these two different techniques give very similar results in both measured structures and magnitude of travel times .",
    "figure  [ fg7]c once again confirms that with or without using signals inside the sunspot does not change our acoustic travel time measurements inside the sunspot , the region where our research interests are , although travel times outside the active region are slightly enhanced .",
    "this can be more clearly seen from figure  [ fg7]d .    selecting different annulus ranges , 19.4 mm @xmath12 29.3 mm , 26.4 mm @xmath12 34.7 mm , 32.2 mm @xmath12 41.3 mm , 38.8 mm @xmath12 47.1 mm , 44.2 mm @xmath12 54.1 mm , 50.8 mm @xmath12 59.9 mm , 57.0 mm @xmath12 65.3 mm and 67.7 mm @xmath12 76.8 mm , outgoing travel times @xmath13 and ingoing travel times @xmath14 from the traditional single - skip , and travel times @xmath15 from the second - skip annulus - annulus cross - correlations",
    "are calculated from each annulus radius after applying the same phase - speed filtering .",
    "furthermore , mean travel times @xmath16 are computed by averaging the outgoing and ingoing travel times .",
    "the variations of these travel times inside sunspot penumbra boundary as functions of annulus radii , defined as the median of the annulus inner and outer radii , are presented in figure  [ fg8 ] .",
    "all travel times are plotted relative to the quiet sun acoustic travel times , which are measured for outgoing , ingoing , mean and double - skip cases separately and are slightly different . from figure  [ fg8 ] , it is quite clear that inside sunspot region , the ingoing travel times are often longer than the outgoing travel times .",
    "more importantly , in contrast to the result that half of double - skip travel times are closer to the ingoing travel times @xcite , it is found in our measurements that the half of double - skip travel times are very similar to the mean travel times , or almost same in some annulus radii .",
    "this shows that the results of time - distance helioseismology are not corrupted by using acoustic signals inside sunspots .",
    "in this paper , we have presented time - distance measurements of the inclined magnetic field effect and the showerglass effect , both of which were introduced and studied by use of the helioseismic holography technique @xcite , and found these effects are less significant in time - distance helioseismology , and do not significantly affect the inversion results . by the second - skip experiment , we have also found that acoustic signals inside sunspots carry useful information and do not corrupt the time - distance results .",
    "meanwhile , it is worthwhile to point out here that , the purpose of this paper is not to compare measurements from helioseismic holography and time - distance helioseismology techniques , but to assess how some measurement effects , which were reported in acoustic holography studies , affect the typical time - distance measurements , and time - distance results that were reported previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our time - distance measurements for the areas with magnetic field lines that are inclined relative to the line - of - sight direction has confirmed the finding by @xcite , that the presence of inclined magnetic field could cause a variation of measured acoustic travel times by an amount of approximately 0.2 minutes .",
    "it has been of significant interest to investigate how this measurement effect might affect the inversions of sunspot s interior structures .",
    "the inversion results for a selected active region when this region was located at different positions on the solar disk have revealed that , this observational effect may only slightly shift the location of the negative sound - speed region , which is often located close to the solar surface , towards the solar disk center .",
    "the inversion results in the deeper interior , approximately below 5.0 mm , remain largely unaffected .",
    "therefore , this measurement effect does not change the major inversion result of the basic sunspot structure that negative sound - speed perturbations are often located in the shallow depth of the sunspot , and positive sound - speed perturbations are beneath approximately 4 - 5 mm .    on the other hand ,",
    "time - distance measurements for mdi continuum intensitygrams and line - depth data have shown that the mean travel times inside sunspots penumbra do not vary with the azimuthal angle .",
    "this is quite an interesting result .",
    "it may indicate that the acoustic information carried by doppler velocity , which is a line - of - sight projection of three - dimensional plasma velocity , is altered due to the interaction between plasma motions and the transverse magnetic field , or due to inaccuracies in the doppler shift measurements in the presence of inclined magnetic field .",
    "however , it seems that from our measurements , acoustic information carried by continuum intensitygrams and line - depth data , which are more related to scalar physics quantities such as temperature and density , is not altered by the presence of transverse magnetic field .",
    "this seems to suggest that intensitygrams and line - depth data are better suited for time - distance or other helioseismic holography studies , however , the poorer signal - to - noise ratio of these data discourages a more general use .",
    "the efforts for better understanding this observational effect , and for designing correction techniques , most likely empirical , to correct this effect in analysis of dopplergram observations are ongoing .",
    "one major characteristic of the showerglass effect introduced in the helioseismic holography technique is that the local ingression and egression control measurements have larger phase shifts in magnetic regions , and also exhibit asymmetric phase shifts @xcite .",
    "our time - distance measurements ( figure  [ fg5 ] ) have shown that , for the short annulus radius , acoustic waves inside active regions have a longer travel time , an order of 0.3 minutes , than the quiet sun , for both the outgoing and ingoing travel times .",
    "while for the longer annulus radius , the outgoing travel time inside active regions can be up to 1.0 minute shorter than in the quiet region , and the ingoing travel time is only about 0.3 minutes shorter .",
    "the asymmetry in outgoing and ingoing travel times for both cases is obvious .",
    "however , all these numbers are significantly smaller than the phase shifts measured by the helioseismic holography technique @xcite , though the differences may come from different frequency bands and very different annulus ( pupil ) sizes .",
    "it was suggested that acoustic signals inside active regions were phase shifted by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , it is demonstrated from both figures  [ fg5 ] and [ fg8 ] , that for different annulus radii , the acoustic travel times inside active regions measured from time - distance technique vary significantly , from @xmath17 to @xmath18 minutes . that is , phase shifts vary greatly depending on the annulus radii used to make measurements , or in other words , phase shifts depend largely on the depth , although one would expect that phase shift should remain relatively constant or varies little if a significant amount of phase shift is caused by the presence of surface magnetism rather than by the sunspot interior structures and dynamics .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to believe that a large fraction of travel time anomalies measured by the time - distance method inside active regions are caused by real subphotospheric structures and dynamics below sunspots rather than only by the artifacts of sunspot surface magnetism . certainly , the showerglass effect itself , how it may affect various types of helioseismic measurements , and how to account for this effect when it is significant are worth of further studies , including observational , theoretical and numerical studies .",
    "our experiment of measuring the second - skip acoustic travel times by annulus - annuls cross - correlations helps to prove that the observed acoustic signals inside active regions provide useful information and do not corrupt time - distance results . the mean travel times through sunspots region , computed by averaging the outgoing and ingoing travel times , are expected to be equal to half of the double - skip travel times , @xmath19 , because they actually measure the same signals along same ray paths passing through the sunspot interior .",
    "previous measurements by @xcite found that @xmath19 was closer to the ingoing travel time than to the mean travel time , which led him to question the use of acoustic signals inside sunspots .",
    "this result was also considered as a supportive evidence for the showerglass effect .",
    "it should be pointed out here that the time - distance measurements by @xcite did not apply commonly used filters that are designed to filter out unuseful acoustic information ( like the phase - speed filter used in time - distance helioseismology ) , complicating interpretations of the measurements .",
    "nevertheless , our measurements ( figures  [ fg7 ] and [ fg8 ] ) have shown clear agreement of @xmath19 with mean travel times @xmath16 .",
    "this obviously indicates that the use of acoustic oscillation signals inside sunspots , as often done in traditional time - distance measurements , do not introduce detectable acoustic phase shifts that may corrupt the time - distance measurements and inversion results .",
    "probably , the differences of our measurements and results of @xcite are caused by the use of phase - speed filtering and different annulus radii and widths . without the filtering",
    ", mixed acoustic modes and different bounces of signals may come into the measurements and complicate the analysis .",
    "therefore , the double - skip experiment performed in this paper suggests that the time - distance measurements , after applying phase - speed filtering , are basically self - consistent even inside highly magnetized sunspot regions .",
    "it is also noteworthy that , by measuring acoustic signals through the sunspot interior , @xcite already confirmed that sound - speed in the sunspot deeper interior are faster , consistent with measurements using observed oscillations inside sunspots .",
    "and also , by employing a center - second skip annulus cross - correlation scheme , @xcite showed that inversion results of deep sunspot interior structures from such measurements agree with the previous time - distance inversion results .",
    "in this paper , by use of the time - distance helioseismology technique , we have examined two observational effects previously found by helioseismic holography : the inclined magnetic field effect and showerglass effect @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed the existence of the inclined magnetic field effect in the time - distance analysis using solar oscillation data from mdi dopplergrams , but found that this effect does not exist in the simultaneous continuum intensitygrams and line - depth observations .",
    "inversions of the time - distance measurements of the mdi doppler data reveal that inclined magnetic field effect is practically insignificant for the helioseismic inferences of the basic sunspot structure .",
    "the inverted sunspot structures just beneath the surface may be slightly shifted when the sunspot is not located close to the solar disk center , but deeper structures remain largely unaffected . for the showerglass effect , we find that for different annulus radii , time - distance measurements give different mean acoustic travel times inside sunspot , which implies that what time - distance helioseismology measures are largely the sunspot interior structure and dynamics rather than acoustic signal phase shifts inside magnetized regions as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the second - skip time - distance experiment also convincingly demonstrates that the double - skip acoustic travel times , measured without using signals inside active regions , are in nice agreement with the mean single - skip acoustic travel times obtained with using signals inside active regions , which indicates that the solar oscillation signals inside sunspots are useful for time - distance helioseismology measurements .",
    "we believe that the numerical studies of the wave interactions with the magnetic field will help us better understand local helioseismological measurements .",
