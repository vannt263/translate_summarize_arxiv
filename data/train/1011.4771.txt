    "<S> the huge amount of the mathematical literature is devoted to mandelbrot and julia sets [ 1 - 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the important task for physicist is the development of physical applications of the theory of complex analytic dynamics and building up of the physical devices and systems in which the complex dynamics is implemented . </S>",
    "<S> just several examples of such systems are exists [ 4 - 9 ] . in the present work a new example of a system in which mandelbrot set can be implemented </S>",
    "<S> is offered . </S>",
    "<S> it is a non - autonomous ring system with nonlinear elements and filters . </S>",
    "<S> this model can be constructed for example on the basis of an optical system of the ikeda cavity type [ 10 ] or as a ring system with the ferromagnetic structures as nonlinear elements [ 11 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the system represented at fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the signal can travel between knots 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 . in the optical resonator </S>",
    "<S> these are the mirrors , turned around from each other so that a ray of light transits on a ring path . </S>",
    "<S> an external pumping c and d exciting the signal in the system are brought at knots 1 and 3 . in optical cavity </S>",
    "<S> it can be semi - glassy mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> signals c and d have complex slow amplitude @xmath8 and @xmath9 and frequency @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that near the knot 1 signal in the ring have slow complex amplitude @xmath11 and frequency @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> by travelimg ( the direction is indicated by arrow ) a signal spreads through the segment of nonlinear medium of length @xmath12 , in which the signal transforms . for example </S>",
    "<S> the component on doubled frequency . </S>",
    "<S> can be excited . </S>",
    "<S> interaction of two these components ( in the case of its synchonism and by approximation of statiobarity of waves ) can be described by differential equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a complex slow amplitude of the component on frequency @xmath10 , @xmath15 is a complex slow amplitude of a component on frequency @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a coordinate along a segment of nonlinear medium . if on an input to a medium the amplitude of component with frequency @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath18 , then on an exit in some approximation the amplitude of the component of frequency @xmath16 is @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> further a signal runs through a filter which passes only component on frequency @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> after that the signal is reflected from a knot 2 and a knot 3 , where external pumping d of frequency @xmath10 is added . on a segment between the third and fourth knot the nonlinear medium of length @xmath20 is located . </S>",
    "<S> transiting through nonlinear medium signal ( with a component of frequency @xmath16 come from the filter and a component of frequency @xmath10 added outside ) transforms according to the equations ( 2 ) . on an exit from a nonlinear medium the component of a signal on frequency @xmath10 in some approximation have intensity @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> further the signal transits through the filter which passes component on frequency @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , on a knot 1 there is an additional external pumping c on the same frequency . </S>",
    "<S> complex amplitudes of external signal and signal in the ring accumulates @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the signal makes the full circle . </S>",
    "<S> it have the same frequency @xmath10 as in the beginning of the path and its complex amplitude can be asymptotically wrote as @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> last expression represents complex map .    numerical experiment of evolution of a signal in this system is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the equations ( 2 ) are integrated ( by runge - kutta method ) . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulation is divided into some stage : 1 ) an integration of a system ( 2 ) with parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and with initial conditions @xmath26 , @xmath27 gives us @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; 2 ) an integration of a system ( 2 ) with parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 and with initial conditions @xmath32 , @xmath33 gives us @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; 3 ) accumulation @xmath22 gives us a new step value of a complex discrete variable @xmath36 . at fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 two charts of a plane of parameter @xmath8 for an investigated system at different values of parameters , characterising the nonlinear media are represented .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously the poicar map @xmath37 is not complex analytical ( it is not satisfies cauchy  </S>",
    "<S> riemann equations ) because system ( 2 ) contains non - analytical term , proportional to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> phenomena of complex analytic dynamics can realise in described model only as a approximation . </S>",
    "<S> one can see at fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 `` almost ideal '' mandelbrot set on top panel which is distorted on bottom panel by the growth of parameters @xmath24 and @xmath31 ( leading to amplification of `` non - analyticity '' ) .    one tool for an analysis of the degree of violation of the complex analyticity , suggested in  @xcite , is the computation of the spectrum of lyapunov exponents . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for a two - dimensional map @xmath39 , @xmath40 they may be determined via the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath41 where @xmath42 in the case of a two - dimensional real map equivalent to an analytic map of one complex variable , two lyapunov exponents must be equal . </S>",
    "<S> it may be shown from the cauchy - riemann conditions @xmath43 that two eigenvalues coincide at any values of parameters and variables . the same is true for the lyapunov exponents expressed as @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> the studying ring system possesses four lyapunov exponents . to compute the lyapunov exponents we used the benettin algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure consists in simultaneous numerical solution of the equations  ( 2 ) and a collection of four exemplars of the linearized equations for small perturbations : @xmath45 with parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 during @xmath46 . and with parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 during @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> signal transformation in the filters are taken into account as the shift of the variables and the perturbation vectors . </S>",
    "<S> pumping signal c gives only impact to the variable .    at each poincar section after passing knot 1 in the ring we perform gram - schmidt orthogonalization and normalization for a set of four vectors @xmath48 ,  @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the lyapunov exponents are estimated as mean rates of growth or decrease of logarithms of the norms of these four vectors : @xmath50 where the norms are evaluated after the orthogonalization but before the normalization .    </S>",
    "<S> computations show that , depending on the regime , two larger exponents may be negative ( periodic attractive orbits ) , positive ( chaotic motions ) and zero ( a border of chaos and quasiperiodic regimes ) . the second lyapunov exponent is more or less close to the first one . </S>",
    "<S> the other two exponents are always negative in the whole domain of existence of bounded dynamical ( i.e. on the mandelbrot set ) and tend @xmath51 . in the left column of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we present charts of the largest lyapunov exponent on the plane  @xmath8 for the same parameters values as at fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> gray tones from light to dark correspond to variation of the lyapunov exponent from  @xmath52  to  @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> observe that at central parts of the mandelbrot set leaves the largest lyapunov exponent becomes large negative , which corresponds to periodic motions of high stability . at edges of the leaves , a thin strip of appearance of positive lyapunov exponent can happen ( chaos ) . </S>",
    "<S> the picture is similar to that for the quadratic complex analytic map ; see  e.g.  ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . at panel ( @xmath7 ) , </S>",
    "<S> distortion of the configuration develops . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can see thick stripe of chaos . </S>",
    "<S> the leaves lose their round form and separate each other . </S>",
    "<S> in the right column of fig .  4 , we depict respective charts for the difference of the two larger lyapunov exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the regions of large difference of the exponent are visualized by dark gray and black color . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals the essential deviation from complex analytic dynamics . </S>"
