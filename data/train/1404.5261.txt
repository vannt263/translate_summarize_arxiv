    "recent discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment has established the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics as the most successful fundamental theory of nature . however , despite its phenomenological success , the sm fails to address many theoretical questions as well as observed phenomena .",
    "three most important observed phenomena which the sm fails to explain are neutrino oscillations , matter - antimatter asymmetry and dark matter .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments in the last few years have provided convincing evidence in support of non - zero yet tiny neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments t2k @xcite , double chooz @xcite , daya - bay @xcite and reno @xcite have not only made the earlier predictions for neutrino parameters more precise , but also predicted non - zero value of the reactor mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe is encoded in the baryon to photon ratio measured by dedicated cosmology experiments like wilkinson mass anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , planck etc .",
    "the latest data available from planck mission constrain the baryon to photon ratio @xcite as @xmath1 presence of dark matter in the universe is very well established by astrophysics and cosmology experiments although the particle nature of dark matter in yet unknown . according to the planck 2013 experimental data @xcite , @xmath2 of the energy density of the present universe",
    "is composed of dark matter . the present abundance or relic density of dark matter",
    "is represented as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density parameter and @xmath5 is a parameter of order unity .",
    "several interesting beyond standard model ( bsm ) frameworks have been proposed in the last few decades to explain each of these three observed phenomena in a natural way .",
    "tiny neutrino masses can be explained by seesaw mechanisms which broadly fall into three types : type i @xcite , type ii @xcite and type iii @xcite .",
    "baryon asymmetry can be produced through the mechanism of leptogenesis which generates an asymmetry in the leptonic sector first and later converting it into baryon asymmetry through electroweak sphaleron transitions @xcite .",
    "the out of equilibrium cp violating decay of heavy majorana neutrinos provides a natural way to create the required lepton asymmetry @xcite .",
    "there are however , other interesting ways to create baryon asymmetry : electroweak baryogenesis @xcite , for example . the most well motivated and widely discussed particle dark matter ( for a review",
    ", please see @xcite ) is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) which interacts through weak and gravitational interactions and has mass typically around the electroweak scale .",
    "weak interactions kept them in equilibrium with the hot plasma in the early universe which at some point of time , becomes weaker than the expansion rate of the universe leading to decoupling ( or freeze - out ) of wimp .",
    "wimp s typically decouple when they are non - relativistic and hence known as the favorite cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate .",
    "although the three observed phenomena discussed above could have completely different particle physics origin , it will be more interesting if they have a common origin or could be explained within the same particle physics model .",
    "here we propose a model which has all the ingredients to explain these three observed phenomena naturally .",
    "we propose an abelian extension of sm ( for a review of such models , please see @xcite ) with a gauged @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "neutrino mass can be explained by both type i and type ii seesaw mechanisms .",
    "some recent works related to the combination of type i and type ii seesaw can be found in @xcite .",
    "dark matter can be explained due to the existence of an additional higgs doublet , naturally stable due to the choice of gauge charges under @xmath7 symmetry . unlike the conventional scalar doublet dark matter models , here",
    "we show how the origin neutrino mass can affect the dark matter phenomenology .",
    "some recent works motivated by this idea of connecting neutrino mass and dark matter can be found in @xcite . in supersymmetric frameworks ,",
    "such scalar dark matter have been studied in terms of sneutrino dark matter in type i seesaw models @xcite as well as inverse seesaw models @xcite .",
    "we show that in our model , the dark matter abundance can be significantly altered due to the existence of a neutral scalar with mass slightly larger than the mass of dark matter , allowing the possibility of coannihilation . and interestingly",
    ", this mass splitting is found to be governed by the strength of type ii seesaw term of neutrino mass in our model .",
    "we show that for sub - dominant type ii seesaw term , dark matter relic abundance can get significantly affected due to coannihilation whereas for dominant type ii seesaw , usual calculation of dark matter relic abundance follows incorporating self - annihilation of dark matter only .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we outline our model with particle content and relevant interactions . in section [ numass ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the origin of neutrino mass in our model . in section [ darkmatter ] ,",
    "we discuss the method of calculating dark matter relic abundance . in section [ results ]",
    ", we discuss our results and finally conclude in section [ conclude ] .",
    "we propose a @xmath7 extension of the standard model with the particle content shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "apart from the standard model fermions , three right handed neutrinos @xmath8 are added with lepton number @xmath9 .",
    "this is in fact necessary to cancel the @xmath7 anomalies . among the scalars , @xmath10 is the standard model like higgs responsible for giving mass to fermions and breaking electroweak gauge symmetry",
    ". the second higgs doublet @xmath11 does not acquire vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and also has no coupling with the fermions .",
    "this will act like an inert doublet dark matter in our model whose stability is naturally guaranteed by the gauge symmetry .",
    "the scalar triplet @xmath12 serves two purposes : its neutral component contributes to the light neutrino masses by acquiring a tiny @xmath13 vev and also generates a mass splitting between the cp - even and cp - odd neutral scalars in the inert higgs doublet @xmath11 .",
    ".particle content of the model [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the yukawa lagrangian for the above particle content can be written as @xmath14 the gauge symmetry of the model does not allow any coupling of the inert higgs doublet @xmath11 with the fermions .",
    "the scalar lagrangian of the model can be written as @xmath15 assuming that the inert doublet @xmath11 does not acquire any vev , the neutral scalar masses corresponding to the higgs doublets @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of sm like higgs boson which is approximately 126 gev and @xmath21 is the vev of the neutral component of sm like higgs doublet @xmath10 .",
    "the cp - even @xmath22 and cp - odd @xmath23 neutral components of inert doublet @xmath11 have a mass squared splitting proportional to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vev acquired by the neutral component of scalar triplet @xmath12 .",
    "tiny neutrino mass can originate from both type i and type ii seesaw mechanisms in our model . as seen from the yukawa lagrangian ( [ yuklag ] ) , the right handed singlet neutrinos acquire a majorana mass term after the @xmath7 gauge symmetry gets spontaneously broken by the vev of the singlet scalar field @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting type i seesaw formula for light neutrinos is given by the expression , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dirac mass term of the neutrinos and @xmath29 is the majorana mass term of the right handed neutrinos .",
    "demanding the light neutrinos to be of ev scale one needs @xmath30 and hence @xmath31 to be as high as @xmath32 gev without any fine - tuning of dimensionless yukawa couplings .    on the other hand ,",
    "the type ii seesaw contribution to neutrino mass comes from the term @xmath33 in the yukawa lagrangian ( [ yuklag ] ) if the neutral component of the scalar triplet @xmath34 acquires a tiny vev .",
    "the scalar triplet can be represented as @xmath35 minimizing the scalar potential gives the approximate value of @xmath25 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the vev acquired by the singlet scalar field @xmath26 responsible for breaking @xmath7 gauge symmetry spontaneously at high scale .",
    "demanding the light neutrinos to be of ev scale one needs @xmath38 to be as high as @xmath32 gev without any fine - tuning of dimensionless couplings .",
    "the relic abundance of a dark matter particle @xmath39 is given by the the boltzmann equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number density of the dark matter particle @xmath39 and @xmath42 is the number density when @xmath39 was in thermal equilibrium .",

    ". numerical solution of the boltzmann equation above gives @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the freeze - out temperature , @xmath48 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of freeze - out .",
    "dark matter particles with electroweak scale mass and couplings freeze out at temperatures approximately in the range @xmath49 .",
    "more generally , @xmath50 can be calculated from the relation @xmath51 the expression for relic density again simplifies to @xcite @xmath52 the thermal averaged annihilation cross section @xmath53 is given by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 s are modified bessel functions of order @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the mass of dark matter particle and @xmath58 is the temperature .",
    "here we consider the neutral component of the scalar doublet @xmath11 as the dark matter candidate which is similar to the inert doublet model of dark matter discussed extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider the lighter mass window for the scalar doublet dark matter @xmath59 , the w boson mass . beyond the w boson mass threshold ,",
    "the annihilation channel of scalar doublet dark matter into @xmath60 pairs opens up reducing the relic abundance of dark matter below observed range for dark matter mass all the way upto around @xmath61 gev .",
    "we note however , that there exists a region of parameter space @xmath62 gev which satisfy relic density bound if certain cancellations occur between several annihilation diagrams @xcite . for the sake of simplicity , we stick to the low mass region @xmath63 in this work .",
    "we also note that there are two neutral components in the doublet @xmath11 , the lighter of which is stable and hence the dark matter candidate . if the mass difference between these neutral scalars @xmath64 is large compared to the freeze - out temperature @xmath47 , then the next to lightest neutral scalar play no significant role in determination of dark matter relic density .",
    "however , if @xmath65 is of the order of freeze - out temperature then @xmath66 can be thermally produced and hence the coannihilations between @xmath67 and @xmath66 during the epoch of dark matter thermal annihilation can play a non - trivial role in determining the relic abundance of dark matter . the annihilation cross section of dark matter in such a case gets additional contributions from coannihilation between dark matter and next to lightest neutral component of scalar doublet @xmath11 .",
    "this type of coannihilation effects on dark matter relic abundance were studied by several authors in @xcite .",
    "here we follow the analysis of @xcite to calculate the effective annihilation cross section in such a case .",
    "the effective cross section can given as @xmath68 where , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 the thermally averaged cross section can be written as @xmath72    in our model , the lightest neutral component of the scalar doublet @xmath11 is the dark matter candidate .",

    "for a particular pair of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we use this value of @xmath50 and compute the thermal averaged cross section@xmath88 to be used for calculating relic abundance using equation ( [ eq : relic ] ) .",

    "we follow the approach and use the expressions discussed in the previous section to calculate the dark matter relic density .",

    "the results are shown as the red v - shaped region in figure [ fig : p20 ] .",

    "in addition to the planck 2013 constraints on dark matter relic density ( [ dm_relic ] ) , there is also a strict limit on the spin - independent dark matter - nucleon cross section coming from direct detection experiments , most recently from lux experiment@xcite .",

    "a recent estimate of the higgs - nucleon coupling @xmath107 gives @xmath108 @xcite although the full range of allowed values is @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "we take the minimum upper limit on the dark matter - nucleon spin independent cross section from lux experiment @xcite which is @xmath110 and show the exclusion line in figure [ fig : p20 ] , [ fig : p21 ] with a label @xmath111 .",
    "the exclusion line gets broaden as shown in blue in figure [ fig : p20 ] , [ fig : p21 ] due to the uncertainty factor in higgs - nucleon coupling .",
    "it should be noted that the spin independent scattering cross section written above ( [ sigma_dd ] ) is only at tree level .",

    "such inelastic dark matter within inert doublet dark matter was studied by authors in @xcite .",
    "they show that such inelastic dark matter scenario in inert doublet model is consistent with exclusion limits from direct detection experiments only when dark matter relic abundance is below the observed abundance .",
    "however , such a scattering process is kinematically forbidden if the mass difference between @xmath67 and @xmath66 is more than the kinetic energy of dark matter @xmath67 .",
    "taking the typical speed of wimp dark matter to be @xmath120 , the kinetic energy of a @xmath116 gev wimp is around @xmath121 kev .",
    "thus for mass differences more than @xmath121 kev , dark matter relic abundance can get affected by @xmath66 , but the direct detection cross section remain unaffected .",
    "we also impose collider bounds by noting that the precision measurement of the @xmath81 boson decay width at lep i forbids the @xmath81 boson decay channel @xmath122 which requires @xmath123 .",
    "the excluded region @xmath124 is shown as a pink shaded region in figure [ fig : p21 ] .",
    "apart from lep i constraint on @xmath81 decay width , lep ii constraints also rule out models satisfying @xmath125 gev , @xmath126 gev and @xmath127 gev @xcite .",
    "as we see from figure [ fig : p21 ] , the allowed region of @xmath128 parameter space including coannihilation satisfy these constraints as the mass difference is not more than 8 gev .",

    "the invisible decay width is given by @xmath131 we show the parameter space ruled out by this constraint on invisible decay width as the brown shaded region for @xmath132 in figure [ fig : p21 ] .",
    "it can be easily seen that this imposes a weaker constraint than the dm direct detection constraint from lux experiment .    in our analysis",
    "we have taken the mass differences between @xmath66 and @xmath67 to be @xmath104 kev . as noted in section [ model ] , the mass difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 is given by @xmath133 .",
    "thus , for @xmath104 kev and dominant type ii seesaw such that @xmath134 ev , the trilinear mass term @xmath135 gev .",
    "however , if we keep the trilinear mass term fixed at say , the @xmath7 symmetry breaking scale , then different mass differences @xmath65 will correspond to different strengths of type ii seesaw term . if we fix the trilinear mass term @xmath136 to be @xmath137 gev say , then @xmath138 will correspond to @xmath139 respectively .",
    "the first two examples correspond to a case of sub - dominant type ii seesaw similar to the ones discussed in @xcite , whereas the third example @xmath140 gev corresponds to a type ii dominant seesaw . comparing this with equation ( [ vevvl ] )",
    ", one gets @xmath141 respectively .",
    "this can be achieved by suitable adjustment of the symmetry breaking scales , the bare mass terms in the lagrangian as well as the dimensionless couplings .",
    "we note that , in conventional inert doublet dark matter model , this mass squared difference is @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a dimensionless coupling .",
    "if we equate this mass difference to a few hundred kev , then the dimensionless coupling @xmath143 has to be fine tuned to @xmath144 .",
    "such a fine tuning can be avoided in our model by suitably fixing the symmetry breaking scales and the bare mass terms in the lagrangian .",
    "we have studied an abelian extension of sm with a @xmath7 gauge symmetry .",
    "the model allows the existence of both type i and type ii seesaw contributions to tiny neutrino masses .",
    "it also allows a naturally stable cold dark matter candidate : lightest neutral component of a scalar doublet @xmath11 .",
    "type ii seesaw term is generated by the vev of a scalar triplet @xmath12 .",
    "we show that , in our model the vev of the scalar triplet not only decides the strength of type ii seesaw term , but also the mass splitting between the neutral components of the scalar doublet @xmath11 .",
    "if the vev is large ( of the order of gev , say ) , then mass splitting is large and hence the next to lightest neutral component @xmath66 plays no role in determining the relic abundance of @xmath67 .",
    "however , if the vev is small such that the mass splitting is below @xmath145 of @xmath102 , then @xmath66 can play a role in determining the relic abundance of @xmath67 .",
    "in such a case , dark matter @xmath22 relic abundance gets affected due to coannihilation between these two neutral scalars .",
    "we compute the relic abundance of dark matter in both the cases : without and with coannihilation and show the change in parameter space .",
    "we incorporate the latest constraint on dark matter relic abundance from planck 2013 data and show the allowed parameter space in the @xmath128 plane , where @xmath86 is the dark matter sm higgs coupling and @xmath87 is the mass of dark matter @xmath67 .",
    "we show the parameter space for mass splitting @xmath146 .",
    "we point out that unlike the conventional inert doublet dark matter model , here we do not have to fine tune dimensionless couplings too much to get such small mass splittings between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this mass splitting can be naturally explained by the suitable adjustment of symmetry breaking scales and bare mass terms of the lagrangian .",
    "it is interesting to note that for sub - dominant type ii seesaw case , the dark matter relic abundance gets affected by coannihilation whereas for dominant type ii seesaw case , usual dark matter relic abundance calculation applies taking into account of self - annihilations only .",
    "we also take into account the constraint coming from dark matter direct detection experiments like lux experiment on spin independent dark matter nucleon scattering .",
    "we incorporate the lep i bound on @xmath81 boson decay width which rules out the region @xmath147 .",
    "we then incorporate the constraint on invisible sm higgs decay branching ratio from measurements done at lhc experiment .",
    "we show that after taking all these relevant constraints into account , there still remains viable parameter space which can account for dark matter as well as neutrino mass simultaneously . thus our model not only gives rise to a natural dark matter candidate , but also provides a natural way to connect the dark matter relic abundance with the neutrino mass term from type ii seesaw mechanism .",
