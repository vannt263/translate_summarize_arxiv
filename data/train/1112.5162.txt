    "the standard orientation - based unification paradigm posits that every active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is comprised of the same basic components : an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole , a broad emission line region ( belr ) , an obscuring torus , and a narrow line region ; radio - loud agn also launch large - scale relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the torus is a key component in this unified model , as it can block the belr along certain lines of sight , and its dust also reprocesses uv / x - ray radiation into the infrared ( ir ) . in simple unification ,",
    "the only other way to hide the belr is also via a geometric argument : emission lines are outshown by a relativistic jet beamed toward earth .",
    "in addition to orientation , intrinsic differences among agn also play a role in agn unification .",
    "for example , @xcite conclude their seminal review with 10 outstanding questions , including one regarding fanaroff - riley galaxies ( fr ; * ? ? ? * ) :  do fr  is have broad emission line regions ? \"",
    "the significance of this question is that if fr  i galaxies lack belrs , then intrinsic properties might play a prominent role in driving the so - called fr",
    "i / ii dichotomy ( in which the more powerful fr  ii galaxies have edge - brightened radio lobes ) .",
    "indications so far are that emission line luminosities from fr  i galaxies are 530 times weaker than for fr ii galaxies , and fr i galaxies may also have weaker tori ( @xcite ; although also see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the requisite observations and their interpretation are technically challenging @xcite , and there are still many ongoing ",
    "nature vs.  nurture \" debates .",
    "we can turn to beamed versions of fr  i and fr  ii galaxies for additional guidance  i.e. , bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , respectively , which are collectively called blazars .",
    "broad emission lines and sometimes dusty tori are routinely detected in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of fsrqs , but less often from bl lac objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it is generally still not observationally clear if bl lac belrs and tori appear weak solely due to dilution by jet emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , or rather if they really are intrinsically weak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "constraints on blazar belrs and tori are furthermore important , as both components are potential sources of seed photons for comptonized gamma - ray emission , especially for fsrqs and low synchrotron peaked ( lsp ) bl  lac objects .",
    "note , gamma - ray emission from high synchrotron peaked ( hsp ) bl  lac objects is generally consistent with synchrotron self compton ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the dusty torus of quasars makes their ir colors redder than for etgs .",
    "the first - order dependence of the quasar ir colors on redshift is simply due to the torus being redshifted through the _ wise _ filters .",
    "although some bl lac objects have _ wise _ colors similar to quasars , bl  lac objects tend to populate the bluer edge of the quasars color space . for most lower - redshift bl lac objects , this is because of hg contamination ( elliptical galaxy seds emit most of their radiation in the near - ir and appear blue in the mid - ir ; see figure  [ fig : sampspec]d ) .",
    "however , beamed synchrotron emission should completely dominate the ir emission from the higher redshift objects and those lacking redshifts ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we thus expect any overlap between the ir colors of highly beamed bl lac objects and sdss quasars to be coincidental , since different mechanisms ( i.e. , synchrotron vs.  thermal dust emission ) are producing their ir flux .              bl lac objects bridge the ir color space between normal galaxies and quasars ( figure  [ fig : wisecolcol]a ) .",
    "one might expect the most weakly beamed bl lac objects to show contributions from both hg starlight and from thermal dust emission from the torus .",
    "then , the most weakly beamed bl lac objects would look more similar to quasars that appear extended in their sdss images ( red plus signs ) .",
    "however , the weakly beamed bl  lac objects ir colors are too blue for a significant contribution from the torus . in this section",
    "we determine if the lack of torus signatures is simply because even weakly beamed jets ( and hgs ) can still outshine the torus .",
    "all etgs in our comparison sample have @xmath23 , so we restrict ourselves to 28 bl lac objects with @xmath23 in this section .",
    "all 28 objects appear as point sources in their _ wise _ images .",
    "there is thus little concern that the wise photometry includes different fractions of the total hg flux as a function of redshift .",
    "we also verify that they show no significant correlation between redshift and either _ wise _ color .",
    "all 28 objects have @xmath24 , so , for uniform comparison , we only consider etgs and quasars from @xmath25 ( 530 and 470 objects , respectively ) .",
    "there are three emission components that must be modeled in the ir : 1 ) starlight from the hg ; 2 ) beamed jet synchrotron emission ; and 3 ) dusty torus emission . to test",
    "if the dusty torus is present , we run monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "these simulations involve building a set of probability density functions ( pdfs ; see  [ sec : irhg ]   [ sec : irtor ] ) , from which we take 10@xmath26 random draws to estimate each ir - emitting component s monochromatic luminosity in each _ wise _ filter . from these luminosities",
    "we synthesize the expected _ wise _ color space occupied by bl  lac populations with and without the torus . throughout",
    "we estimate all luminosities at @xmath27 to minimize k - correction uncertainties , and we restrict comparison samples to a narrow redshift range near @xmath27 . for all pdfs modeled as ( log)-normal distributions below , we first check that their observed parameter distributions are indeed approximately gaussian .",
    "we consider the observed properties of 164 etgs with @xmath28 ( the median of our low - redshift bl lac sample ) .",
    "we first build a pdf for the monochromatic luminosity in the w2 filter , assuming a log - normal distribution with @xmath29  erg  s@xmath8  hz@xmath8 .",
    "then we make pdfs for hg colors using normal distributions with @xmath30  mag and @xmath31  mag .",
    "randomly drawing from each distribution allows us to estimate hg monochromatic luminosities in each @xmath32 filter .",
    "this method implicitly accounts for measurement uncertainties .",
    "we begin with an unbeamed 5  ghz radio core luminosity @xmath33 , and we use the broad - band radio - ir spectral index @xmath34 to estimate an unbeamed ir jet luminosity in the w1 filter , @xmath35 . beamed ir jet luminosity is then calculated as @xmath36 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath37^{-1}$ ] is the doppler parameter , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the viewing angle ( @xmath40 corresponds to a perfectly aligned jet ) , and @xmath41 is the jet velocity normalized to the speed of light .",
    "we then use @xmath42 and the local ir spectral index @xmath43 to estimate beamed jet luminosities in the w2 and w3 filters . and",
    "@xmath34 are not strongly affected by beaming , which is not strictly true but a reasonable approximation once the jet is highly enough beamed to appear as a bl lac object . ]",
    "to estimate beamed jet luminosities for a random viewing angle , lorentz factor , and jet power , we randomly draw from the following pdfs : a log - normal distribution for @xmath33 with @xmath44  erg  s@xmath8 ( derived from equation  2 and table  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a normal distribution for @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a uniformly distributed @xmath39 from 040@xmath47 . for @xmath43 , we fit power laws to the w1 , w2 , and w3 flux densities ( in @xmath48 ) for the 69 bl  lac objects lacking redshifts . based on those measurements , we then randomly draw @xmath43 from a normal distribution with @xmath49 .",
    "we similarly measure @xmath34 for those 69 bl  lac objects ( assuming @xmath27 ) using the radio fluxes in and the w1 filter .",
    "we then randomly draw @xmath34 from a normal distribution with @xmath50 .",
    "finally , once we estimate luminosities in each filter as described in the previous paragraph , we add random noise to each luminosity by assuming @xmath51 , 0.05 , and 0.1 in the w1 , w2 , and w3 filters , respectively ( based on typical _ wise _ flux measurement uncertainties for our full bl  lac sample ) .",
    "we employ a realistic coupling between the jet and accretion flow to estimate ir luminosities from the dusty torus .",
    "first we estimate x - ray luminosity @xmath52 ( from 210  kev ) using @xmath53 from above and the following relations from @xcite , based on a sample of low - luminosity agn with mechanical jet power estimates : @xmath54-\\log[b/0.2]\\right ) \\\\                                             & \\quad    -(0.78\\pm0.36 ) \\end{split }                        \\label{eq : merxrayjet}\\ ] ] and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the kinetic power of the jet in erg  s@xmath8 , @xmath57  erg  s@xmath8 is the eddington luminosity , and @xmath58 is fraction of the bolometric luminosity emitted from 210  kev .",
    "we note that equations [ eq : merxrayjet ] and [ eq : merradjet ] are consistent with the theoretical scalings for jet dominated accretion flows , @xmath59_{j , r}/l_{edd}\\right)\\propto(l_{kin}/l_{edd})^{17/12}$ ] and @xmath60 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the above scalings are applicable to hard state x - ray binaries and their supermassive analogs , including bl lac objects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then assume x - ray luminosity is a good tracer for the torus ir luminosity , using the ir / x - ray correlation from @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the ir luminosity at 12.3 @xmath6 m , and the x - ray luminosity , @xmath52 , is from 2 - 10  kev .",
    "combining equations [ eq : merxrayjet ] , [ eq : merradjet ] , and [ eq : irxray ] leaves us the following relation for the ir torus emission at 12.3  @xmath6 m , assuming an unbeamed radio core luminosity at 5  ghz : @xmath63    where we assume @xmath64 ( to conservatively err on the side of underestimating the torus flux ) .",
    "finally , we extrapolate torus luminosity to the w2 filter assuming an ir spectral index of 0.15 between 12.3 and 4.6  @xmath6 m ( estimated at @xmath27 from the average @xcite quasar sed ) , and we estimate ir luminosities in the w1 and w3 filters using pdfs based on the _ wise _ colors of 150 quasars ( @xmath25 ) with point - like sdss morphologies .    for the mc simulations , we build the following additional pdfs . for @xmath65",
    "we assume bl  lac black hole masses are log - normal with @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "since equation  [ eq : irxray ] relies on several assumptions that propagate non - linearly , we randomly add intrinsic scatter to each estimate of @xmath67 assuming a generous @xmath68  dex . for the pdfs for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we first randomly draw @xmath69 from a normal distribution with @xmath71  mag . since quasar _",
    "wise _ colors are correlated , we then use the best - fit relation @xmath72 to build the @xmath70 pdf , and we add random noise using the _ root - mean - square ( rms ) _ scatter about the best - fit regression , @xmath73  mag .      we perform 10@xmath26 mc simulations to estimate luminosities from each ir - emitting component in each _ wise _ filter . figure  [ fig : wisecolcol ] shows the synthesized _ wise _ colors if only one , two , or all three components are included .",
    "note , the simulated jets encompass a range of viewing angles @xmath74 and lorentz factors .",
    "@xcite show that blazars fall in a distinct region of ir color space , which they call the ` _ _ wise _ _ blazar strip . '",
    "the most highly beamed bl  lac objects ( i.e. , the 69 lacking redshifts ) also fall within the strip , and a ks test shows that the w1-w2 and w2-w3 distributions for those 69 bl  lacs and our synthesized ` blazar strip ' ( panel b ) are not significantly different ( @xmath75 and 0.6 , respectively ) .",
    "however , for the 28 weakly beamed objects , a bluer ir component ( i.e. , the hg ) is necessary ( @xmath76 and 10@xmath77 from ks tests comparing their w1-w2 and w2-w3 distributions to the synthesized jet ) .    to explain the sdss population of weakly beamed bl lac objects ( blue squares ) , we favor the synthesized colors including the jet and hg ( figure  [ fig : wisecolcol]c ) over the colors that also include the torus ( figure  [ fig : wisecolcol]d )",
    "the simulations including the torus predict that bl  lac colors should be weighted toward redder ir colors , while the simulations with only the jet and galaxy predict ir colors more consistent with observations .",
    "ks tests show that the w1-w2 and w2-w3 distributions for 28 bl  lac objects with @xmath25 and the synthesized colors including the torus are statistically different ( @xmath76 and 10@xmath78 , respectively ) , while similar parent distributions are not highly excluded between the observed colors and the synthesized colors without the torus ( @xmath79 and 0.02 ) .",
    "we conclude from the above that our weakly beamed bl lac objects lack observational signatures of the dusty torus in the mid - ir .",
    "thus , bl lac dusty tori appear weaker than the tori of luminous quasars ( i.e. , one can not simply scale a normal quasar torus down to bl lac luminosities ) .",
    "another way to express this conclusion is that bl lac tori have different properties than the tori of normal quasars .",
    "it is reasonable to extrapolate this result to highly beamed bl lac objects , if beaming is primarily a geometric argument . if one interprets the torus as an extension of the belr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then our study suggests that bl lac belrs are also intrinsically weak .",
    "we stress that this is a statistical conclusion . the simulations including the torus do predict a small population of weakly beamed bl  lac objects with _ wise _ colors matching the observations , but that population is not large enough to explain the ir colors for the bl  lac population as a whole .",
    "however , we can not exclude the presence of the torus / belr from every single bl  lac object .",
    "indeed , some bl  lac objects can show very weak broad emission lines in their optical spectra ( especially some lsps ) .",
    "one explanation for weaker bl lac tori is that their physical properties ( i.e. , torus geometries , dust properties , ionizing seds , etc . )",
    "are different than for luminous quasars .",
    "another interpretation is the same one invoked for optically dull agn and `` naked '' seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as follows .",
    "consider a scenario where the belr and torus are fed by a radiatively driven disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at sufficiently low accretion rate ( below a few percent @xmath80 )",
    ", the inner region of the accretion disk is replaced by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) .",
    "the riaf is then no longer able to support a sufficient wind to populate the belr and torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the strength of the belr and torus is intimately connected to the efficiency of the accretion flow and therefore accretion rate .",
    "indeed , such an `` accretion rate dichotomy '' has already been suggested to explain the bl lac / fsrq divide ( with bl lac objects fed by riafs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". such a scheme may also be responsible for the fr",
    "i / ii divide ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , an important ( supporting ) point is that the classification of unbeamed radio galaxies based on high - excitation vs.  low - excitation emission lines ( which are likely connected to the accretion flow ) is more physically meaningful than the older fr  i / ii scheme based on radio morphology / jet power ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , such a division is naturally expected from the hysteresis displayed by accreting stellar mass black holes , where changes in x - ray spectral states for individual objects ( i.e. , at fixed orientations ) may similarly be related to the efficiency of the inner accretion flow .",
    "_ wise _ offers a new perspective on the strength of the obscuring torus in low - luminosity radio galaxies .",
    "the _ wise _ view of bl lac objects is consistent with other ( independent ) indications of an accretion rate dichotomy among agn , adding a complementary piece to the puzzle .",
    "further constraints on such a division in accretion mode is an important step for better understanding agn unification .",
