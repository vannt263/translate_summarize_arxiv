    "<S> we propose a new process of magnon - assisted andreev reflection at a ferromagnetic metal - superconductor interface , which consists of the simultaneous injection of a cooper pair from the superconductor and the emission of a magnon inside the ferromagnet . at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> this process represents an additional channel for sub - gap transport across an fs interface , which lifts restrictions on the current resulting from the necessity to match spin - polarized current in the ferromagnet with spin - less current in the superconductor . for a junction between a superconductor and a ferromagnet with an arbitrary degree of polarization , </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic magnon - assisted andreev reflection process would manifest itself as a nonlinear addition to the @xmath0 characteristics which is asymmetric with respect to the sign of the bias voltage and is related to the density of states of magnons in the ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> expressions for the subgap @xmath0 characteristics are given for arbitrary interfacial quality whilst the limiting cases of uniformly transparent and disordered interfaces are discussed in detail .    2 </S>"
