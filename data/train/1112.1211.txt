    "the present paper will be devoted to the study of some properties of the conformal loop ensembles ( cle ) defined and studied by scott sheffield in @xcite and by sheffield and werner in @xcite .",
    "a simple cle can be viewed as a random countable collection @xmath1 of disjoint simple loops in the unit disk that are non - nested ( almost surely no loop surrounds another loop in cle ) .",
    "the paper @xcite shows that there are several different ways to characterize them and to construct them . in that paper , a cle",
    "is defined to be such a random family that also possesses two important properties : it is conformally invariant ( more precisely , for any fixed conformal map @xmath2 from the unit disk onto itself , the law of @xmath3 is identical to that of @xmath1  this allows to define the law of the cle in any simply connected domain via conformal invariance ) and it satisfies a certain natural restriction property that one would expect from interfaces in physical models .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there exists exactly a one - parameter family of such cles .",
    "each cle law corresponds exactly to some @xmath4 $ ] in such a way that for this @xmath5 , the loops in the cle are loop - variants of the sle@xmath6 processes ( these are the schramm - loewner evolutions with parameter @xmath5  recall that an sle@xmath6 for @xmath7 is a simple curve with hausdorff dimension @xmath8 ) , and that conversely , for each @xmath5 in that range , there exists exactly one corresponding cle .",
    "part of the arguments in the paper @xcite are based on the analysis of discrete `` exploration algorithms '' of these loop ensembles , where one slices the cle open from the boundary and their limits ( roughly speaking when the step - size of explorations tends to zero ) .    in the earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "sheffield had pointed out a way to construct a number of random collections of loops , using variants of sle@xmath6 processes . in particular , for any @xmath4 $ ] , he has shown how to construct random collections of sle@xmath6-type loops ( or rather `` quasi - loops '' that should turn out to be loops , we will come back to the precise definition later ; for the time being the reader can think of these quasi - loops as boundaries of a bounded simply connected component that is a loop with at most one point of discontinuity ) that should be the only possible candidates for the conformally invariant scaling limit of various discrete models , or of level lines of certain continuous models .",
    "roughly speaking , one chooses some boundary point @xmath9 on the unit circle ( `` the root '' ) and launches from there a branching exploration tree of sle processes ( or rather target - independent variants of sle@xmath6 processes called the sle(@xmath10 ) processes ) that will trace some loops along the way , that one keeps track of . for each @xmath5 and @xmath9",
    ", there are in fact several ways to do this .",
    "one particular way , that we will refer to as _ symmetric _ in the present paper , is to impose certain `` left - right '' symmetry in the law of the exploration tree , but several other natural options are described in @xcite .",
    "hence , for each @xmath5 , the exploration tree is defined via the choice of the root @xmath9 and the exploration `` strategy '' that describes how `` left - right '' asymmetric the exploration is .",
    "these exploration strategies are particularly natural , because they are invariant under all conformal transformations that preserve @xmath9 .",
    "note also that it is conjectured that the exploration indeed traces a tree with continuous branches , but that this result is not yet proved ( to our knowledge ) .",
    "nevertheless , these processes indeed trace continuous quasi - loops along the way .",
    "so to sum up , once @xmath5 , @xmath9 and a given strategy are chosen , the loewner differential equation enables to construct a random family of quasi - loops in the unit disc ( and the law of this family a priori depends on @xmath5 , on @xmath9 and on the chosen strategy ) .",
    "one can also note that the symmetric strategy is very natural for @xmath11 from the perspective of the gaussian free field , but much less so from the perspective of interfaces of lattice models .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath12 viewed as the scaling limit of the ising model ( see @xcite ) , the `` totally asymmetric '' procedure seems more natural .",
    "based on the conjectured or proved relation to discrete models and to the gaussian free field , sheffield conjectures in @xcite that for any given @xmath7 , all these random collections of loops traced by the various exploration trees have the same law .",
    "one consequence of the results of sheffield and werner in @xcite is that this conjecture is indeed true for all symmetric explorations : more precisely , for each @xmath4 $ ] , the law of the random collection of quasi - loops traced by a symmetric sle@xmath13 exploration tree rooted at @xmath9 does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , their common law is proved to be that of  the cle \" with sle@xmath6-type loops mentioned in the first paragraph of this introduction , and they can also be viewed ( see @xcite ) as outer boundaries of clusters of brownian loop - soups ( which proves that the quasi - loops are in fact all loops ) .",
    "one main idea in @xcite is to study the asymptotic behavior of the discrete explorations when the steps get smaller and smaller , and to prove that it converges to the above - mentioned symmetric sle(@xmath10 ) process .",
    "the first main result of the present paper can be summarized as follows : _ for each @xmath4 $ ] , all the random collections of sle@xmath6-type quasi - loops constructed via sheffield s asymmetric exploration trees in @xcite have the same law .",
    "they all are the cle@xmath6 families of loops constructed in @xcite . _",
    "the proof of this fact will heavily rely on the results of @xcite , but we will try to make our paper as self - contained as possible .    recall that when one works directly in the sle - framework , certain questions turn out to be rather natural ",
    "it is for instance possible to derive rather directly the values of certain critical exponents , to compute explicitly probabilities of certain events , or to study questions related to conformal restriction  while the setting of the loewner equation does not seem so naturally suited for some other questions .",
    "proving reversibility of the sle path ( that the random curve defined by an sle from @xmath14 to @xmath15 is the same as that defined by an sle from @xmath15 to @xmath14 ) turns out to be very tricky , see @xcite .",
    "a by - product of @xcite is that it provides another proof of this reversibility in the case where @xmath4 $ ] . in a way , our results are of a similar nature : one obtains results about these asymmetric branching sle processes without going into fine loewner chain technology .",
    "the second main point of our paper is to highlight something specific to the case @xmath11 i.e. to cle@xmath0 ( recall that this is the cle that is most directly related to the gaussian free field , see @xcite ) . in this particular case , it is possible to define a conformally invariant and unrooted ( one does not need to even choose a starting point ) growing mechanism of loops ( the term `` exploration '' that is used in this paper is a little bit misleading , as it is not proved that the growth process is in fact a deterministic function of the cle , we will discuss this at the end of the paper ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the growth process that progressively discovers loops is growing `` uniformly '' from the boundary ( even if it is a poisson point process and each loop is discovered at once ) and does not require to choose a root .",
    "the fact that such a conformally invariant non - local growth mechanism exists at all is quite surprising ( and the fact that its time - parametrization as seen from different points does exactly coincide even more so ) .",
    "it also leads to a conformal invariant way to describe distances between loops in a cle ( where any two loops in a cle are at a positive distance of each other ) and to a new coupling of cle with the gaussian free field that will be studied in more detail in the subsequent work @xcite , and to open questions that we will describe at the end of the paper .",
    "in the present section , we recall some ideas , arguments and results from @xcite , and set up the framework that will enable us to derive our main results in a rather simple way .",
    "suppose throughout this section that @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to define the _ squared bessel process _ @xmath17 of dimension @xmath18 started from @xmath19 as the unique solution to the stochastic differential equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a brownian motion ( note that it is implicit that this solution is non - negative because one takes its square root ) .    the non - negative process @xmath22 is then usually called the bessel process of dimension @xmath18 started from @xmath23 .",
    "it is not formally the solution to the stochastic differential equation @xmath24 because it gets an ( infinitesimal ) upwards push whenever it hits the origin , so that @xmath25 is not a martingale ( note for instance that when @xmath26 , the process @xmath27 is a reflected brownian motion , which is clearly not the solution to @xmath28 ) .",
    "this stochastic differential equation however describes well the evolution of @xmath29 while it is away from the origin , and if one adds the fact that @xmath29 is almost surely non - negative , continuous and that the lebesgue measure of @xmath30 is almost surely equal to @xmath31 , then it does characterize @xmath29 uniquely . note that the filtration generated by @xmath29 and by @xmath32 do coincide ( @xmath32 can be recovered from @xmath29 ) .",
    "bessel processes have the same scaling property as brownian motion : when @xmath33 , then for any given positive @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the same law ( this is an immediate consequence of the definition of its squared process @xmath37 ) . just as in the case of the it measure on brownian excursions ,",
    "it is possible to define an infinite measure @xmath38 on ( positive ) bessel excursions of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "an excursion @xmath39 is a continuous function @xmath40)$ ] defined on an interval of non - prescribed length @xmath41 such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",
    "the measure @xmath38 is then characterized by the fact that for any @xmath9 , the mass of the set of excursions @xmath45 is finite , and that if one renormalizes @xmath38 in such a way that it is a probability measure on @xmath46 , then the law of @xmath39 on @xmath47 $ ] is that of a bessel process of dimension @xmath18 , started from @xmath9 and stopped at its first hitting time of the origin .",
    "the fact that @xmath48 is a local martingale when @xmath29 is away from the origin ( which follows immediately from the definition of the bessel process @xmath29 and from it s formula ) shows readily that @xmath49 for some constant @xmath50 that can be chosen to be equal to one ( this is the normalization choice of @xmath38 ) .",
    "standard excursion theory shows that it is possible to define the process @xmath29 by gluing together a poisson point process @xmath51 of these bessel excursions of dimension @xmath18 , chosen with intensity @xmath52 .",
    "suppose that we are given a parameter @xmath53 $ ] and that for each excursion @xmath39 of the bessel process @xmath29 , one tosses an independent coin in order to choose @xmath54 in such a way that the probability that @xmath55 ( respectively @xmath56 ) is @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) .",
    "then , one can define a process @xmath59 by gluing together the excursions @xmath60 instead of the excursions @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath62 , but some of the excursions of @xmath59 are negative as soon as @xmath63 .",
    "the process @xmath64 is the _",
    "symmetrized _ bessel process such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 have the same law .",
    "note that ( as opposed to @xmath66 ) the process @xmath59 is not a deterministic function of the underlying driving brownian motion @xmath32 in the stochastic differential equation when @xmath67 , because additional randomness is needed to choose the signs of the excursions .",
    "however , @xmath32 is still a martingale with respect to the filtration generated by @xmath59 because the signs of the excursions are in a way independent of the excursions .    in the sequel",
    ", it will be useful to consider the processes @xmath59 for various values of @xmath68 simultaneously .",
    "clearly , it is easy to first define @xmath29 and then to couple all signs in such a way that for each excursion @xmath39 of @xmath29 , @xmath69 as soon as @xmath70 ; we will implicitly always work with such a coupling .    in the context of sle processes , it turns out to be essential to try to make sense of a quantity of the type @xmath71 .",
    "we define , for each excursion , the integral @xmath72 it is easy to check that @xmath73 from which it follows using scaling that @xmath74 for @xmath38 almost all excursion @xmath39 .",
    "note also that the scaling shows that @xmath75 it follows that typically , the number of excursions that occur before time @xmath76 for which @xmath77 is of the order of @xmath78 , so that their cumulative contribution to @xmath79 is of the order of @xmath80 .",
    "if we sum this over @xmath81 , one readily sees that when @xmath82 , then @xmath83 almost surely as soon as @xmath84 ( and this argument can be easily made rigorous ) due to the cumulative contributions of the many short excursions during the interval @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "hence , @xmath86 can not be defined as a simple absolutely converging integral .",
    "there are however ways to circumvent this difficulty .",
    "the first classical one works for all @xmath87 $ ] but it is specific to the case where @xmath88 i.e. to the symmetrized bessel process @xmath64 . in that case , when one formally evaluates the cumulative contribution to @xmath89 of the excursions for which @xmath90 , then the central limit theorem suggests that one will get a value of the order of @xmath91 ; when one then sums over @xmath81 , one gets an almost surely converging series .",
    "this heuristic can be easily be made rigorous , and this shows that one can define a process @xmath92 that one can informally interpret as @xmath93 ( even though this last integral does not converge absolutely ) .",
    "another possible way to characterize this process is that it is the only process such that :    * @xmath94 is almost surely continuous and satisfies brownian scaling .",
    "* @xmath95 is zero on any time - interval where @xmath64 is non - zero . *",
    "the process @xmath96 is a deterministic function of the process @xmath64 .",
    "let us reformulate and detail our first approach to @xmath97 in a way that will be useful for our purposes .",
    "suppose that @xmath98 is given and small .",
    "we denote by @xmath99 the set of times that belong to an excursion of @xmath29 away from the origin , that has time - length at least @xmath100 ( we choose @xmath100 in order to have the same scaling properties as for the height and @xmath101 ) .",
    "then , because the integral @xmath102 on each individual excursion is finite , we see that it is possible to define without any difficulty the absolutely converging integral @xmath103 then , as @xmath104 the continuous process @xmath105 converges to the continuous process @xmath96 .",
    "more rigorously    when @xmath106 , then on any compact time - interval , the sequence of continuous functions @xmath107 converges almost surely to a limiting continuous function @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath108 denote the end - time of first excursion that has time - length at least @xmath109 ( here @xmath110 should be thought of as very large , so that this time , which is greater than @xmath109 , is large too ) .",
    "it suffices to prove the almost sure convergence on the interval @xmath111 $ ] ( as any given compact interval is inside some interval @xmath111 $ ] for large enough @xmath110 ) .    let us suppose that @xmath112 .",
    "notice that the process @xmath113 is monotonous ( i.e. non - increasing or non - decreasing ) on each excursion of @xmath29 , so that @xmath114    next we define the @xmath115-field @xmath116 generated by the knowledge of all excursions @xmath117 , but not their signs . if we condition on @xmath116 and look at the value of @xmath118 at the end - times of the excursions of length greater than @xmath119 , we get a discrete martingale . from doob",
    "s @xmath120 inequality , we therefore see that almost surely , @xmath121    the right - hand side is in fact the mean of the square of a series of symmetric random variables of the type @xmath122 for some given @xmath123 and coin - tosses @xmath124 . therefore , it is equal to @xmath125 where the sum is over all excursions appearing before time @xmath126 , corresponding to times in @xmath127 . by simple scaling ,",
    "the expectation of this quantity is equal to a constant times @xmath128 , so that finally @xmath129 it then follows easily ( via borel - cantelli ) that almost surely , the function @xmath130 converges uniformly as @xmath106 on the time - interval @xmath131 $ ] ( and that the limiting process @xmath96 is continuous ) .",
    "this construction of @xmath96 can not be directly extended to the case where @xmath132 .",
    "indeed , the cumulative contributions of those excursions of @xmath59 for which @xmath133 is then of the same order of magnitude than when @xmath134 ( the previously described case where one looks at the integral of @xmath135 ) .",
    "a solution when the dimension of the bessel process is smaller than @xmath76 , is to compensate the explosion of this integral appropriately .",
    "let us first describe this in the case where @xmath134 ( i.e. @xmath136 is the non - negative bessel process ) .",
    "as for instance explained in @xcite , section 3 , it is possible to characterize the principal value @xmath137 of the integral of @xmath138 as the unique process such that :    * @xmath139 is almost surely continuous .",
    "* @xmath140 is zero on any time - interval where @xmath29 is non - zero .",
    "* @xmath141 is adapted to the filtration of @xmath29 and satisfies brownian scaling .",
    "let us describe how to construct explicitly this process @xmath142 .",
    "for any very small @xmath143 , recall the definition of the time - set @xmath99 , and define @xmath144 as the number of excursions of time - length at least @xmath100 that @xmath29 has completed before time @xmath145 .",
    "simple scaling considerations show that ( for fixed @xmath145 ) , @xmath144 will explode like ( some random number times ) @xmath146 as @xmath104 .    just as before",
    ", there is no problem to define the absolutely converging integral @xmath147 but , as we have already indicated , when @xmath148 this quantity tends to @xmath149 when @xmath143 tends to @xmath31 .",
    "one option is therefore to consider the quantity @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the mean value of the integral of @xmath152 for an excursion conditioned to have length greater than @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath153 is a constant that does not depend on @xmath154 when @xmath104 , @xmath155 explodes like @xmath156 , but nevertheless :    as @xmath106 , the process @xmath157 does almost surely converge uniformly on any compact time - interval to some continuous limiting process @xmath158 .",
    "the proof goes along similar lines as in the case @xmath88 , but there are some differences .",
    "let us prove again almost sure convergence on each @xmath131 $ ] for each given @xmath110 .    first , let us notice that for each @xmath159 , the quantity @xmath160 is constant , except on the excursion - intervals of time - length between @xmath161 and @xmath143 .",
    "if we follow the value of this quantity only at ( the discrete set of ) end - times of excursions of length greater than @xmath161 , we get a discrete martingale .",
    "doob s inequality and scaling , just as before , imply that @xmath162 the right - hand side can be viewed as the sum of a geometric number of zero - mean random variables with bounded second moment , and it follows from scaling that it can be bounded by @xmath163 it follows that almost surely , the function @xmath164 converges uniformly as @xmath106 on the set @xmath165 .",
    "the definition of @xmath166 then yields that this almost sure uniform convergence takes place on all of @xmath131 $ ] ( just because the supremum of the integral of @xmath135 over all excursions of length greater than @xmath143 before @xmath126 goes to @xmath31 as @xmath104 ) .    on the other hand , if we slightly modify @xmath167 on each excursion interval by adding a linear function that makes it continuous on the closed support of the excursion in order to compensate the @xmath168 jump of @xmath167 and the end - time of the excursion , one obtains a continuous function @xmath169 such that @xmath170 for each @xmath145 .",
    "it follows that almost surely @xmath171 converges uniformly on any compact time - interval to the same limit as @xmath164 . as the functions @xmath169 are continuous",
    ", it follows that this limit is almost surely a continuous function of time .    for any @xmath68 ( and as long as @xmath172 ) , the very same idea can be used to define a process @xmath173 associated to @xmath59 instead of @xmath29 , as the limit when @xmath104 of the process @xmath174    let us describe in more detail a variant of the previous construction that will be useful for our purposes .",
    "suppose that one is working with the coupling of all processes @xmath59 ( for fixed @xmath172 ) .",
    "we then define the process @xmath175 in other words , we replace @xmath59 by @xmath64 on all excursions of length smaller than @xmath100 .",
    "clearly , this makes it possible to make sense of the continuous process @xmath176 ( because only the times in @xmath99 i.e. in the macroscopic excursions will contribute )",
    ". we can therefore define the process @xmath177 this process @xmath178 follows exactly the evolution of @xmath96 except that some excursions of length greater than @xmath100 are sign - changed ( and on these excursions @xmath179 is constant ) , and that at the end of each of those excursions , it makes a small jump of @xmath180 .",
    "then , almost surely , when @xmath104 , the process @xmath178 converges uniformly on any compact time - interval to a process @xmath173 because the two processes @xmath181 and @xmath182 do almost surely uniformly converge to zero on any given compact interval .",
    "the previous definition of @xmath173 can not be directly adapted to the case @xmath26 . however , one notes that for any real @xmath183 , the process @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the local time at @xmath31 of @xmath186 does also satisfy the brownian scaling property and that @xmath187 on all intervals where @xmath186 is non - zero .",
    "this process @xmath188 can in fact again be approximated via @xmath189 ( using the classical approximation of brownian local time ) ; more precisely , it is the limit as @xmath104 of the process @xmath190      we now recall ( mostly from @xcite ) how to use the previous considerations in order to give an sle based construction of the loop ensembles .",

    "all these sle(@xmath10 ) processes are of particular interest because of their target - independence property : up to the first time at which the loewner chain disconnects @xmath239 from infinity , the two loewner chains ( from @xmath31 to @xmath149 , and from @xmath31 to @xmath239 ) have the same law ( modulo time - change ) .",

    "it is shown in @xcite that for almost all ( positive ) bessel excursion @xmath39 ( according to the bessel excursion measure that we have denoted by @xmath38 ) , this defines a such a simple loop @xmath249 in the upper half - plane , that starts and ends at the origin ( and @xmath250 $ ] ) .",
    "the time - length @xmath251 of the loop corresponds to the half - plane capacity seen from infinity of @xmath252 .",
    "the infinite measure on loops @xmath252 that one obtains when starting from the infinite measure @xmath38 on bessel excursions is referred to as the one - point pinned measure in @xcite .",

    "it is not clear at this point that this is a proper continuous loop in @xmath191 because we do not know whether @xmath257 extends continuously to the origin , but we already know that it is almost a loop : in particular , the preimage of @xmath258 is a simple curve such that its closure disconnects some interior domain from an outer domain in @xmath198 . in the sequel , we will refer to this as a quasi - loop ( mind that in @xcite , this is called a `` conformal loop '' and that the term quasi - simple loops is used for something different ) .",
    "one of the consequences of @xcite is that _ in the symmetric case _ , all these quasi - loops are in fact loops ( here one uses the alternative construction using brownian loop - soup clusters ) . for the other cases",
    ", we shall see that it is also the case , but at this stage of the proof , we do not know it yet .    as explained in @xcite ,",
    "the target - independence makes it possible to define ( for each version of the sle(@xmath10 ) that we have defined , and that we will implicitely keep fixed in the coming three paragraphs ) a `` branching sle '' structure starting from @xmath31 and aiming at a dense set of points in the upper half - plane .",
    "let us first describe the process targeting @xmath259 , until it discovers a quasi - loop around @xmath259 ( this is the `` radial '' sle(@xmath10 ) ; we choose here not to introduce the radial loewner equation but to explain this radial process via the chordal setting ) : consider a chordal sle(@xmath10 ) from @xmath31 to @xmath149 until time @xmath260 , which is the first end - time of an excursion of @xmath186 after the first moment at which the loewner chain reaches the ( half)-circle of radius @xmath261 away from the origin .",

    "then , we repeat the same procedure again : grow an sle(@xmath10 ) from the origin in @xmath191 until the first end - time of an quasi - loop that touches the circle of radius @xmath261 etc . , and we look at its preimage under @xmath263 ( this can be interpreting as a switch of chordal target at @xmath260 , this pre - image chain now aims at @xmath268 instead of @xmath149 ) . after a geometric number of iterations ,",

    "furthermore , for these ensembles , all quasi - loops are almost sure plain loops ( the proof of these last facts are based on the fact that these loop ensembles are the only family of loops that satisfy some axiomatic properties , and that they can also be constructed as boundaries of clusters of brownian loops ) .",
    "the present section is devoted to the proof of the following proposition and to its analogue for @xmath11 , proposition [ eqvincle2 ] ) :    [ eqvincle ] for all given @xmath226 , the law of cle@xmath290 does depend neither on @xmath9 nor on @xmath68 .",
    "note that this also proves that in these ensembles , all quasi - loops are indeed loops because we already know that cle@xmath291 almost surely consists of loops .",
    "recall also that we know that this cle@xmath288 does not depend on @xmath9 ( in the present section , we will simply refer to it as the cle@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is therefore enough to check that in the upper half - plane , the laws of cle@xmath292 and of cle@xmath293 coincide , ie .",
    ", that for any given @xmath294 in the upper half - plane , the joint law of @xmath295 is the same for these two cles .",
    "let us first make the following observations :    1 .   a by - product of the characterization / uniqueness of cle derived in @xcite is the fact that the image measure @xmath296 on pinned loops @xmath255",
    "( i.e. the image measure of @xmath38 under @xmath297 ) is invariant under the symmetry with respect to the imaginary axis ( @xmath298 ) . in other words",
    ", it is the same as the image measure on loops defined by @xmath299 if one forgets about the time - parametrization of the loops ( this is closely related to the reversibility of sle paths first derived by zhan @xcite by other more direct means ) .",
    "note that the time - length @xmath251 is both the half - plane capacity of @xmath255 and of @xmath300 for a given @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   suppose now that we consider a _",
    "sle(@xmath10 ) with driving function @xmath211 , that we stop at the first time @xmath301 at which it completes an excursion of length greater than @xmath100 .",
    "this defines a certain family of loops in the unit disc via the procedure described above .",
    "if we are given some sign @xmath302 ( independent of the process @xmath211 ) , we can decide to modify the previous process @xmath211 into another process @xmath303 , by just ( maybe ) changing the sign of the final excursion before @xmath301 into @xmath304 ( it may be that we do not have to change it in order to have it equal to @xmath304 ) .",
    "then , clearly , the law of @xmath305 is absolutely continuous with respect to that of @xmath306 , and it therefore also defines almost surely a family of loops in the unit disk .",
    "the previous item shows in fact that the collection of loops defined by these two processes up to @xmath301 have exactly the same law ( because changing the sign of one final excursion does not change the distribution of the corresponding loop ) .",
    "furthermore , the law of the collection of connected components of the complement of this symmetric sle(@xmath10 ) at that moment are clearly identical too .",
    "3 .   suppose that @xmath307 is some stopping time for the driving function @xmath233 of the symmetric sle(@xmath10 ) process started from the origin in the half - plane .",
    "suppose furthermore that this stopping time is chosen in such a way that almost surely @xmath308 .",
    "then , we know that the process @xmath309 is distributed exactly as @xmath211 itself , and furthermore , it is independent of @xmath310 .",
    "this means that the conditional law given @xmath310 of the non - yet explored loops is just a cle@xmath6 in the yet - to - be explored domain .",
    "this makes it possible to change the starting point of the upcoming evolution , because we know that the law of the loops defined by the branching symmetric sle(@xmath10 ) is independent of the chosen starting point .",

    "more precisely , for each @xmath81 , if one samples ( conditionally on the process up to @xmath311 ) independent cle@xmath6 s in the remaining unexplored connected components created by the loewner chain at time @xmath311 , and considers the union of the obtained loops with the loops that have been discovered before @xmath311 , then one gets a full cle@xmath6 sample .",
    "let us now combine the previous facts in the case where @xmath317 ( i.e. , @xmath318 ) .",
    "suppose now that @xmath98 is fixed .",

    "up to time @xmath322 , we perform the exploration using the driving function @xmath323 ( that is defined using the symmetrized bessel process ) except that the sign of the last excursion may have been changed depending on the sign @xmath324 .",
    "note that we have just recalled that this procedure defines exactly loops of a cle@xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath322 is the end - time of an excursion and corresponds exactly to the completion of a cle loop .",
    "then , we force a jump of @xmath325 of the driving function , and continue from there until time @xmath326 by following the dynamics of @xmath323 ( possibly changing the sign of the last excursion before @xmath327 . at @xmath326",
    ", we again wake a jump of @xmath328 . combining the previous two items",
    "shows that for any @xmath81 and @xmath143 , the following procedure constructs a cle sample :    * sample the previous process until time @xmath320 .",
    "keep all the loops corresponding to the excursions of @xmath186 . * in each connected components created along the way by this loewner chain ( one can view these connected components as those of the complement of the closure of the union of the interior of all the loops created by the chain  because these loops are `` dense '' in the created chain ) as well as in the remaining unbounded component , sample independent cle@xmath6 s .",
    "note that the result still holds , if for some given @xmath143 , one stops the process at a stopping time which is the end - time of some loop ( not necessarily a @xmath329 ) .",
    "let us now look at the driving function of the previously defined loewner chain .",
    "it is exactly the one that would obtain if the signs of the excursions of length larger than @xmath100 are those given by @xmath330 etc . , and one also puts in the negative jumps at each time @xmath329 .",

    "a first important observation is that , as argued in the previous sections , the function @xmath333 converges uniformly towards @xmath334 on any compact interval . on the other hand ,",
    "we have just described a relation between the loewner chain / the loops generated by @xmath333 and cle@xmath6 .",
    "our goal is now to deduce a similar statement for the loewner chain generated by @xmath334 . for that chain ,",
    "let @xmath335 denote the complement of the chain at time @xmath145 ( using the usual notations , and the time - parametrization of @xmath334 ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us first focus only on the law of the loop that surrounds one fixed interior point @xmath336 in a cle@xmath337 .",
    "two scenarios can occur . either for the loewner chain ( without branching , and targeting infinity ) generated by @xmath334",
    ", @xmath271 is at some point swallowed by a quasi - loop ( that we then call @xmath338 ) or not .",
    "let @xmath339 and @xmath340 denote these two events .",
    "if @xmath340 holds , then let @xmath341 .",
    "when @xmath339 holds , the quasi - loop @xmath342 corresponds to a time - interval @xmath343 for some excursion @xmath39 , that in turn corresponds ( for each @xmath143 ) to some loop @xmath344 traced by the loewner chain driven by @xmath333 .",
    "the almost sure convergence of @xmath333 to @xmath334 implies that ( with full probability on the event that @xmath342 exists ) in carathodory topology seen from @xmath271 , the inside of the loop corresponding to @xmath344 converges to the inside of @xmath342 as @xmath104 ( note that the loops @xmath344 will surround @xmath271 for all small enough @xmath143 ) .    it is a little more tricky to handle the case where @xmath345 holds . note",
    "that then @xmath346 can not belong to some @xmath347 $ ] ( because this interval corresponds to a quasi - loop that is locally drawn like a simple slit ) .",
    "furthermore , in this case , for any time @xmath145 before @xmath348 , @xmath271 belongs to the still to be explored unbounded simply connected domain @xmath335 .",
    "target - independence of the sle(@xmath10 ) processes yields that modulo reparametrization , one can view the evolution of the loewner chain before @xmath348 as a radial sle(@xmath10 ) targeting @xmath271 as described before .",
    "in particular , this implies that the conformal radius of @xmath335 seen from @xmath271 decreases continuously to some limit when @xmath349 increases to @xmath350 .",
    "this limit is the conformal radius of the simply connected domain that we denote by @xmath351 and that is the decreasing limit ( seen from @xmath271 in carathodory topology ) of @xmath335 as @xmath145 increases to @xmath348 ( note that we have not excluded the  somewhat unlikely  case where @xmath352 when @xmath345 holds ) .    in the next couple of paragraphs , since @xmath271 is fixed , we will omit to mention the dependence of @xmath348 , @xmath353 etc on @xmath271 , and write @xmath354 , @xmath355 instead .",
    "in the same way , we can define almost surely , for each @xmath143 , @xmath356 or @xmath357 depending on whether the loewner chain drawn by @xmath358 creates a quasi - loop around @xmath271 or not ( here , we use the target - independence of the symmetric sle(@xmath10 ) ) .",
    "one problem to circumvent is that the fact that @xmath333 converges uniformly to @xmath334 on any compact interval is not enough to ensure that @xmath359 converges to @xmath355 , for instance because just before the disconnection time , a very small fluctuation of the driving function can create a path that enters and exits this soon - to - be - cut - off domain .",
    "an additional problem is that it could be that , even for small @xmath143 , @xmath360 is much larger than @xmath348 .",
    "one way around this is to introduce additional stopping times that approximate @xmath354 from below .",
    "for instance , for each @xmath361 , define @xmath362 to be the first time @xmath145 at which it is possible to disconnect @xmath271 from infinity in @xmath198 by removing from @xmath198 a ball of radius @xmath361 .",
    "then , let @xmath363 ( this is just to take care of the possibility that @xmath364 ) . then finally , if this time belongs to some quasi - loop interval @xmath365 , define @xmath366 to be the end - time @xmath367 of this quasi - loop , and otherwise let @xmath368 .",
    "note that @xmath369 is a stopping time with respect to the filtration of @xmath334 .",
    "clearly , for any small @xmath361 , @xmath370 as soon as @xmath354 is finite ( recall that @xmath371 can not be equal to some @xmath372 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath366 can not increase to anything else than @xmath371 as @xmath361 decreases to @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the convergence of @xmath333 to @xmath334 ensures that for each given @xmath361 , the domain @xmath373 converges in carathodory topology ( seen from @xmath271 ) to @xmath374 when @xmath104 .",
    "hence , we conclude that for a well - chosen @xmath375 ( small enough ) , as @xmath376 along some well - chosen sequence , almost surely on the even @xmath377 , the sequence of domains @xmath378 converges in carathodory topology to @xmath379 .    for each given @xmath361",
    ", choose @xmath375 very small , we can construct a loop surrounding @xmath271 as follows , using the loewner chain associated to @xmath333 .",
    "if this chain has traced a loop @xmath380 that surrounds @xmath271 along the way before @xmath381 , then just keep this loop .",
    "if not , then sample in the domain @xmath378 an independent cle@xmath6 , look at the loop that surrounds @xmath271 in this sample , and call it @xmath382 .",
    "our previous arguments relating the loops traced by @xmath333 to cle@xmath6 ( note that @xmath383 is a stopping time at which all these loewner chains complete a quasi - loop ) show that for each fixed @xmath361 and @xmath143 , the law of @xmath382 is the same as the law of the loop that surrounds @xmath271 in an cle@xmath6 in @xmath191 .",
    "note finally that in the case @xmath384 where a quasi - loop @xmath385 is discovered by the loewner chain driven by @xmath334 , then ( as we have argued before ) the same holds true for the loewner chain driven by @xmath333 for all small @xmath143 , and that furthermore , for all small @xmath361 and @xmath143 , @xmath386 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that for a well - chosen sequence @xmath387 ( with a well - chosen @xmath388 ) , in the limit when @xmath106 , the constructed loop ( which has always the law of @xmath283 in a cle@xmath6 in @xmath191 as we have just argued ) is :    * either @xmath385 if @xmath384 holds * or otherwise , obtained by sampling a cle@xmath6 in @xmath355 .",
    "but now , because we know that this procedure defines a loop that is distributed like @xmath283 is a cle@xmath6 , one can use the branching idea , and iterate this result within @xmath355 .",
    "we then readily get that the law of the quasi - loop that surrounds @xmath271 in a cle@xmath389 is identical to the law of the loop that surrounds @xmath271 for a cle@xmath6 .",
    "in fact , in order to describe the law of cle@xmath390 , we have to see what happens when one looks at the joint distribution of the loops that surround @xmath81 given points @xmath294 .",
    "the argument is almost identical : the main difference is that one first replaces @xmath346 by @xmath391 and also changes @xmath392 into @xmath393 which is associated to the first time at which adding some ball of radius @xmath361 to the loewner chain disconnects at least one of these @xmath81 points from infinity in @xmath335 .",
    "the rest of the procedure is basically unchanged and readily leads to the fact that the joint distribution of the set of loops that surround these points in a cle@xmath394 or in a cle@xmath6 are identical , which completes the proof of proposition [ eqvincle ] .",
    "the only additional ingredient is to note that when one considers a decreasing sequence of open simply connected sets @xmath395 , the law of the cle@xmath6 in @xmath395 ( as described via its finite - dimensional marginals ) converges to the law obtained by sampling independent cle@xmath6 s in the different connected components of the interior of @xmath396 ( which is a fact that follows for instance directly from the description of cle@xmath6 as loop - soup cluster boundaries ) .",
    "this ensures that in the limit when @xmath106 ( for well - chosen @xmath397 and @xmath398 ) , on the event @xmath399 , sampling a cle@xmath6 in @xmath400 converges in law ( in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions ) to sampling two independent cle@xmath6 s in @xmath401 and in the cut - out component @xmath355 at time @xmath354 .    for @xmath11 and @xmath402 .",
    "in the same spirit , we choose the driving function @xmath403 then , the very same arguments as before show that the corresponding constructed loops are those of a cle . and",
    "on the other hand , the driving function @xmath404 converges to @xmath405 .",
    "this allows to complete the proof of the following fact :    [ eqvincle2 ] when @xmath11 , the law of cle@xmath406 does depend neither on @xmath9 nor on @xmath183 .",

    "basically , at each time @xmath320 ( the end - times of the excursions of @xmath186 of time - length at least @xmath100 ) , we decide to resample the position of the driving function according to the uniform density in @xmath407 $ ]  here @xmath408 should be thought of as very large , we will then let it go to infinity .",

    "i.e. the choice of the new point according to the uniform distribution  is in fact independent of the future behavior of @xmath186 ) .",

    "as we have explained earlier , each bessel excursion in fact corresponds ( via loewner s equation ) to a two - dimensional loop in the upper - half plane , that touches the boundary only at the origin .",
    "let us call @xmath426 the loop corresponding to @xmath427 . to each excursion @xmath427 of the bessel process",
    ", we also associate a random position @xmath428 sampled according to the uniform measure on @xmath410 $ ] ( more precisely , conditionally on all bessel excursions @xmath429 , the random variables @xmath430 are i.i.d . with this distribution ) .",
    "then , we define the loop @xmath431 by shifting @xmath426 horizontally by @xmath432 ( and so , the loop @xmath431 touches the real axis at @xmath432 ) .    for each excursion @xmath427",
    ", we can now define the conformal transformation @xmath433 from the connected component of @xmath434 that contains @xmath259 onto @xmath191 such that @xmath435 and @xmath436 . as this will be useful",
    ", we now reintroduce the dependence on @xmath408 in the notation for these maps ( and write @xmath437 ) .    for a given @xmath408 , we start with a poisson point process @xmath438 of bessel excursions defined under the measure @xmath439 and we then associate to each excursion the uniform random variable @xmath440 .",
    "a cleaner equivalent way to describe the process @xmath441 is to say that it is a poisson point process with intensity @xmath442 .",
    "then , clearly , we get a poisson point process @xmath443 of such conformal maps ( because for each @xmath239 , @xmath444 is a deterministic function of the pair @xmath445 and @xmath446 is a poisson point process ) .    for each @xmath447 , one can then define @xmath448 ( where the composition is done in the order of appearance of the maps @xmath449 ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath450 corresponds to the loewner map ( generated by the driving function @xmath303 ) at the time ( in the loewner time parametrization ) corresponding to the completion of all loops @xmath451 for @xmath452 . in other words , if @xmath453 is the time - length of the excursion @xmath427 , the loewner time at which the loop corresponding to that excursion will start being traced is @xmath454 .    hence , the loops @xmath455 are distributed like cle loops . in particular , the loop that contains @xmath259 will be the loop @xmath456 where @xmath457    let us rephrase what we have done so far : for each @xmath408 , we have seen that one can define cle loops by considering the loewner chain generated by @xmath303 , using the poisson point process @xmath458 , or equivalently , via the poisson point process @xmath459 with intensity measure @xmath460 where @xmath461 denotes the measure on loops rooted at @xmath9 ( like in @xcite , we define this measure as the measure @xmath296 on loops in the upper half - plane generated via a bessel excursion defined under @xmath38 , and shifted horizontally by @xmath9 ) .",
    "now , let us describe what happens when @xmath462 .",
    "suppose now that we consider the poisson point process @xmath463 with intensity @xmath464 and the corresponding iterations of maps @xmath465 .",
    "even though this measure seems `` even more infinite '' than @xmath466 , this iteration of conformal maps does not explode .",
    "this is due to the scaling properties of @xmath461 and to the fact that one normalizes always at @xmath259 ( so that loops rooted far away do not contribute much the derivative at @xmath259 )  one can for instance justify this using lemma [ confinvm ] below .    note also that if we keep only those loops in @xmath467 that are rooted at a point in @xmath410 $ ] , we obtain a process with the same law as @xmath468 . the key observation is now to see that when @xmath462 , each map @xmath469 converges uniformly in any compact subdomain of the closed upper half - plane to @xmath465 .",
    "this implies the following :    the loops @xmath470 are also distributed like loops in a cle .    0.7   construction of @xmath471.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.7   construction of @xmath471.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.7   construction of @xmath471.,title=\"fig : \" ]    at this stage ,",

    "an important reason to choose this particular measure and to focus on the case where @xmath472 is that the following lemma holds only in this case :    [ confinvm ] when @xmath11 the measure @xmath473 is conformal invariant .",
    "recall from @xcite that when @xmath472 and if @xmath2 is a conformal transformation of the half - plane onto itself , @xmath474 where the measure @xmath475 is defined by @xmath476 hence , it follows immediately that @xmath477 .",
    "a direct consequence of this conformal invariance is that    when @xmath11 , the law of @xmath478 is invariant under any moebius transformation @xmath2 of the upper half - plane that preserves @xmath259 .",
    "note that there is no time - change involved .",
    "the law of @xmath479 and @xmath480 are for instance identical .",
    "let @xmath2 be a moebius transformation of the upper half - plane that preserves @xmath481 and @xmath482 be a poisson point process with intensity @xmath483 and define @xmath484 for @xmath485 and @xmath486 for @xmath487 as described above .",

    "let us now choose some other point @xmath271 than @xmath259 in the upper half - plane .",
    "let @xmath115 denote the first moment if it exists at which the process @xmath501 disconnects @xmath259 from @xmath271 . if the loop @xmath502 surrounds both @xmath259 and @xmath271 , we simply set @xmath503 .",
    "note that the event that @xmath504 can happen when the process discovers a loop surrounding one of the two points and not the other , but at this stage , it is not excluded that it can disconnect two points strictly before discovering the loops that surround them , just like the symmetric sle(@xmath10 ) does , see @xcite .",
    "define the same process @xmath505 as above , except that we choose to normalize `` at @xmath271 '' instead of normalizing at @xmath259 .",
    "one way to describe it would be to write @xmath506 , where @xmath507 is the affine transformation from @xmath191 onto itself such that @xmath508 ( but we will use another way to describe it in terms of @xmath509 in a moment ) .",
    "we then define @xmath510 to be the first moment at which it disconnects @xmath271 from @xmath259 or discovers the loop that surrounds both points .",
    "when @xmath11 , and for any @xmath511 , the law of @xmath512 is identical to the law of @xmath513 .",
    "we shall use the following classical result about poisson point process ( see for instance @xcite , section 0.5 ) :    let @xmath514 be a poisson point process with some intensity @xmath515 ( defined in some metric space @xmath516 ) .",

    "we are now ready to prove the lemma .",
    "consider the process @xmath523 defined from the poisson point process @xmath524 with intensity @xmath473 as above ( and keep the same definitions for @xmath126 , @xmath525 with @xmath526 , @xmath486 with @xmath527 , where the latter are defined by normalizing the maps at @xmath259 ) .",

    "define for each @xmath534 @xmath535 we also define @xmath536 , and we say that @xmath520 is the identity map for all @xmath537 .",
    "it is clear that , for each positive @xmath239 , the map @xmath520 is a @xmath521-measurable moebius transformation from the upper half - plane onto itself .",
    "hence , the process @xmath538 is also poisson point process with intensity @xmath473 .",
    "if we use the point process @xmath539 to construct the process @xmath540 normalized at @xmath271 , we get a coupling of @xmath541 and @xmath542 in such a way that they coincide up to time @xmath115 : for all @xmath543 , @xmath544 , and in addition , @xmath545 ( if this @xmath546 exists ) so that @xmath547 .",
    "hence , with this coupling , we see that @xmath548 almost surely . by symmetry",
    "( because there exists a conformal map interchanging these two points ) , it follows that @xmath549 almost surely .",
    "this means that it is possible to couple these two processes up to the first moment at which it disconnects @xmath259 from @xmath271 . by scaling ,",

    "hence , it is possible to couple the processes @xmath550 for _ all _ @xmath270 simultaneously in such a way that for any two points @xmath271 and @xmath279 , the previous statement holds .",
    "if we now use such a coupling , we get a markov process on domains @xmath552 : at time @xmath553 , the domain is the upper half - plane , and at time @xmath554 , it is the union of all the ( disjoint ) open sets corresponding to the evolution to all points @xmath271 at time @xmath239 .",
    "existence of such a conformally invariant process is a rather striking feature , as it uses no reference point , and the time of the evolution is preserved through the conformal transformation .",
    "we can therefore sum up the properties of this process as follows .",
    "[ propo ] the process @xmath552 provides a way to construct cle@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the processes @xmath552 and @xmath555 are identically distributed ( with no time - change ) for all moebius transformations @xmath2 .",
    "note that this uniform exploration mechanism can also be viewed as the limit ( in law ) of the asymmetric cle@xmath556 construction of proposition [ eqvincle2 ] in the limit when @xmath557 ( and the boundary points @xmath558 and @xmath559 of the upper half - plane are identified , alternatively , one can state this easily in the radial setting ) .",
    "we leave the details to the interested reader .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that an sle@xmath0 can be deterministically drawn as the contour lines ( or sometimes called level - lines or cliff - lines ) in a gaussian free field with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "see also @xcite for the fact that the entire cle@xmath0 can be deterministically embedded in a gaussian free field .",
    "note that the symmetric exploration process looks a priori more naturally associated to the gaussian free field than the asymmetric ones , because when one defines a gaussian free field out of a cle@xmath0 with the coupling described in @xcite , one has to toss an independent coin for each cle@xmath0 loop to decide an orientation , so that the symmetric sle(@xmath560 ) ( including the coin tosses ) is defined via the randomness present in the gff .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the dynamic `` uniform '' construction of sle@xmath0 described in proposition [ propo ] actually also yields a rather natural construction of the gff .    in general",
    ", the conformally invariant ways to construct a cle that we described in the present paper via these branching loewner chains induce additional information than just the cle ( which loop is discovered where , what is the starting and end - point of the loop when one uses a given exploration etc . ) .",
    "this leads naturally to the following open questions :    1 .",
    "if we are given a cle@xmath6 in a simply connected domain @xmath561 and a starting point on the boundary of @xmath561 , and a family of bernoulli random variables @xmath562 with parameter @xmath68 ( one for each cle loop @xmath252 ) , is the asymmetric exploration process with parameter @xmath68 deterministically defined ? 2 .   in particular ,",
    "is the totally asymmetric exploration process ( when @xmath134 ) sample a deterministic function of the cle sample and of the starting point ?",
    "3 .   is the uniform exploration process in fact a deterministic function of the cle@xmath0 ?",
    "our proofs rely a lot on the fact that the symmetric bessel explorations do indeed construct the loops in a cle , which was derived in @xcite using a discretization of the exploration procedure that was proved to converge to the symmetric bessel construction .",
    "the other cle constructions that we have studied in the present paper also have natural discrete counterparts that we now briefly describe .",
    "however , it turns out to be ( seemingly ) technically more unpleasant to control the convergence of these asymmetric discrete exploration procedures than the symmetric ones , so that it seemed simpler to derive our results building on the relation between cle s and the symmetric construction .",
    "we first recall the exploration procedures described in @xcite to explore a cle little by little ( here a cle is just a collection of loops that satisfy the cle axioms defined in @xcite )",
    ". it will be easier to explain things in the radial setting i.e. in the unit disk instead of the half - plane .",
    "suppose that @xmath563 is a cle in the unit disc @xmath564 and that @xmath565 is given .",
    "we denote @xmath283 as the loop of @xmath566 ( when it exists ) surrounding @xmath567 . throughout this section",
    ", @xmath568 will denote the image of the set @xmath569 under the conformal map @xmath570 from the upper half - plane @xmath191 onto the unit disc such that @xmath571 .",

    "note that we allow here for different possible choices for @xmath577 .",

    ", we consider the pushforward of @xmath566 by @xmath583 ( which has the same law as @xmath566 itself , due to the cle axioms ) and we repeat step 1 . if we discover a loop that surrounds the origin at that step , then we stop and define @xmath584 .",
    "otherwise , we define the connected component @xmath585 that contains the origin of the domain obtained when removing from @xmath586 the loops of @xmath587 that do not stay in this domain , and we define the conformal map @xmath588 from @xmath585 onto @xmath564 with @xmath589 and @xmath590 , where @xmath591 is chosen in a conditionally independent way of @xmath592 , given @xmath574 , @xmath585 and @xmath577 .",
    "we then explore @xmath593 and so on .",
    "we can iterate this procedure until the step @xmath594 at which we eventually  discover \" a loop that surrounds the origin .",
    "note that @xmath572 ( the loop in @xmath566 that surrounds the origin ) is the preimage of this loop ( the loop in @xmath595 that surrounds the origin and intersects @xmath568 ) under @xmath596 .    in this definition , the discrete exploration `` strategy ''",
    "is encoded by @xmath361 ( the `` step - size '' ) and by the rule used to choose the @xmath597 s .",
