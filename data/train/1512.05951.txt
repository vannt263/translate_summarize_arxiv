    "atom - surface interactions are important for understanding numerous physical , chemical and biological processes . owing to this , research works of lennard - jones  @xcite , bardeen  @xcite , casimir and polder  @xcite and lifshitz  @xcite have drawn a lot of attention over the last few decades  @xcite . in the non - retarded regime ( at small distances )",
    ", the forces between the fluctuating atomic dipole and its immediate image associated with the polarization charges induced in the surface brings about the atom - surface van der waals interactions  @xcite .",
    "thus , for the short separation distance ` @xmath3 ' between the atom and surface , the interaction energy scales as @xmath4 ( at the intermediate distances , the retardation effects are taken into account by introducing a damping function ) , while for large atom - surface distances as compared to a typical atomic wavelength , the interaction energy scales as @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "investigations of the van der waals dispersion forces between an atom and a surface are of immense interest to the physicists working in various domains of physical sciences . assessing these forces accurately can result in new pathways towards engineering , technology and research . finding out well behaved interactions of atoms or molecules with atomically well defined surfaces are beneficial for advocating future device applications at the nanometer dimensions  @xcite .",
    "these atom - surface interactions can cause shifts in the oscillation frequencies of the trap that can change the trapping conditions . therefore , when the trapping potentials are determined , particularly at the magic wavelengths , these effects need to be accounted for @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive cognizance of the dispersion coefficients is necessary for the experimental studies of photoassociation , realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , interpreting fluorescence spectroscopy , determination of scattering lengths , and analysis of feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "knowing their behaviors are significantly important in generating novel atom optical devices , also known as the atom chips  @xcite .",
    "[ dype ]    the atom - wall interaction potentials have significant dependences on the dielectric properties of the materials  @xcite .",
    "majority of the earlier theoretical works involve the interactions of the ground states of atoms with metallic or dielectric surfaces , considering both the non - retarded and retarded van der waals forces  @xcite .",
    "since precise measurement of the interaction potentials or in that sense the dispersion coefficients are extremely difficult , very few experimental investigations of the van der waals interactions between the atoms in their ground states and solid state surfaces have been accomplished  @xcite . however , very precise measurements of ratios of the dispersion coefficients of some of the alkali atoms with sin@xmath2 have been reported @xcite .",
    "this gives an opportunity to test the validity of a method to reproduce the experimental results .",
    "for the theoretical determinations , the @xmath0 coefficients can be efficiently expressed in terms of the conducting properties of trapping media and the dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the interacting atom following the lifshitz theory  @xcite .",
    "available theoretical studies on the cs atom - wall interactions are performed considering approximated values of either the dynamic polarizabilities of the cs atom or the conducting properties of the materials  @xcite . in our previous work , we have demonstrated importance of using accurate values of the atomic dynamic polarizabilities in order to compare ratios of the dispersion coefficients of the light nuclei alkali atoms with their corresponding measured values @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these interactions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy using the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method .    in this work ,",
    "we intend to calculate the van der waals interaction potentials between the cs atom in the ground state with the trapping materials as an ideal conductor , a normal good conductor like au , a semiconductor like si , dielectric objects like sio@xmath1 , sin@xmath2 , sapphire and a yag surface by using accurate polarizability values of the cs atom . combining these results with our previously estimated @xmath0 coefficients for the other alkali atoms @xcite",
    ", we would like to present ratios of these constants with respect to the cs atom . unless stated otherwise , we use atomic units ( a.u . ) throughout the paper .",
    "the formula given by e. m. lifshitz and collaborators in moscow in 1955 can efficiently be applied to describe the van der waals and casimir - polder interactions between an atom and a semispace , a material plate , or a layered structure @xcite . for the intermediate separations , where the atom - wall force of attraction is almost negligible ,",
    "the atom - wall interactions can be computed by considering a polarizable particle interacting with a surface or a wall as a continuous medium having a frequency dependent permittivity @xmath6 .",
    "the working formula for the interaction potential in terms of the dielectric constants is given by  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , @xmath9 is the dynamic dipole polarizability of the atom , @xmath3 is the distance of separation between the cs atom and a surface or a wall and @xmath10 is the frequency dependent dielectric constant of the wall .",
    "the expression for @xmath11 , which is a function of the dielectric permittivity of the material wall , is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "evaluation procedure of this functional form is described in refs .",
    "@xcite . a more general expression for the potential as described in eq.([atwp ] ) for both the retarded and short distances",
    "is conveniently expressed by @xmath14 where the expression for the dispersion coefficient @xmath0 is given by @xmath15 for @xmath16 at the short distance , this interaction potential can be approximated to a simple form as  @xcite @xmath17 for a perfect conductor , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , it yields @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 .    adopting a similar approach as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we actuate to evaluate the @xmath0 coefficients and @xmath22 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 coefficients using eq .",
    "( [ c3eq ] ) and interaction potentials using eq .",
    "( [ atwp ] ) . by combining these two quantities ,",
    "we determine the retarded function @xmath23 using eq.([veq ] ) . to calculate the @xmath0 and retarded functions for a perfect conductor , we use eqs .",
    "( [ c3p ] ) and ( [ f3p ] ) directly .",
    "as can be noticed , accurate evaluation of these quantities entirely depend on the accuracies in the values of the dynamic polarizabilities of the atom and dynamic dielectric constants of the material or a wall .",
    "thus , importance of the present work lies in the rigorous determination of these dynamic properties of the cs atom and materials under consideration .",
    "we describe below the approach considered to evaluate the dynamic polarizabilities of the cs atom and dynamic dielectric constants of au , si , and sio@xmath1 , sin@xmath2 , sapphire and yag surfaces having conducting , semiconducting and dielectric characteristics , respectively .    lcc transition & e1 amplitude ( a.u . ) & @xmath24 ( a.u . ) + & & + 6@xmath25 - 6@xmath26 & 4.489  @xcite & 131.88 + 6@xmath25 - 7@xmath26 & 0.32 & 0.34 + 6@xmath25 - 8@xmath26 & 0.10 & 0.03 + 6@xmath25 - 9@xmath26 & 0.05 & 0.01 + 6@xmath25 - 10@xmath26 & 0.03 & @xmath27 + 6@xmath25 - 6@xmath28 & 6.324  @xcite & 249.38 + 6@xmath25 - 7@xmath28 & 0.64 & 1.37 + 6@xmath25 - 8@xmath28 & 0.25 & 0.18 + 6@xmath25 - 9@xmath28 & 0.14 & 0.05 + 6@xmath25 - 10@xmath28 & 0.09 & 0.02 +   + @xmath29 & & 383.30 + @xmath30 & & 16.8 + @xmath31 & & @xmath32 + @xmath33 & & 0.2 + total & & 399.8 + & & + others & & 399  @xcite,399.9  @xcite + experiment & & 401.0(6 )  @xcite    .[c3 ] calculated @xmath0 coefficients for the interaction of the cs atom with the perfect conductor , au ( metal ) , si ( semiconductor ) and the dielectric surfaces ( sio@xmath1 , sin@xmath2 , sapphire and yag ) along with the classification of contributions from various parts of the dynamic polarizabilities .

    "in the present work , we have analyzed the atom - surface interactions between the cesium atom in its ground state with a perfect conductor , au ( metal ) , si ( semiconductor ) and various dielectric surfaces ( sio@xmath1 , sin@xmath2 , sapphire and yag ) .",
