    "black holes are extreme objects whose study is very rich and relies on different branches of physics . among the most important and fundamental phenomena of black hole physics are the hawking evaporation mechanism see @xcite for a review and the existence of quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) see @xcite for a review . on the one hand ,",
    "the evaporation phenomenon reveals the profound links between gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "its study is both extremely fruitful in itself and because of the quantum gravitational effects expected to occur during the last stages of the evaporation , when the semi - classical approach breaks down . on the other hand ,",
    "quasi - normal modes are of particular importance because they revealed black holes to be stable under perturbations and represent a key ingredient in the computation of gravitational wave signals .",
    "this article focuses on the investigation of bound states for massive particles emitted by black holes .",
    "the problem is mathematically quite close to the investigation of massive qnms @xcite , as in both cases the point is to find the characteristic complex frequencies allowing a massive ( scalar ) field to propagate in a black hole background , while satisfying given boundary conditions at the black hole horizon and at spatial infinity ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless because those boundary conditions are not the same , the physical meaning of bound states and quasi - normal modes are very different and correspond to different energy ranges .",
    "although bound states are well known to exist in quite a lot of classical and quantum systems , this work points out their specific existence around black holes , even at the monopolar order , and investigates some important consequences . in most of the literature , bound states refer both to particles _ orbiting _ the black hole or back scattered to the black hole . in this work , we are interested in quanta trapped between the finite black hole potential barrier and the infinitely thick well which prevents the particles from reaching infinity if their energy is low enough .",
    "as will be demonstrated hereafter , those orbiting states are not strictly stable but can be characterized by finite lifetimes .    in section",
    "ii , we first determine the conditions for such states to exist and compute their energy spectra and lifetimes at the wkb order .",
    "thanks to a simple toy model , we estimate in section iii the average number of trapped particles as a function of their characteristic energies . those trapped massive particles whose greybody factors must be computed numerically will also inevitably modify the hawking radiation spectrum at infinity , which is computed in this section .",
    "some conclusions are finally given together with perspectives .",
    "the investigation of orbiting quantum bound states around schwarzschild black holes requires one to solve relativistic quantum mechanical equations in a curved background , while taking into account a non - vanishing mass . to show that those states do exist , the klein - gordon equation in a schwarzschild background will be shown to exhibit a radial potential containing a local well for given ranges of black hole horizon radii and particle masses .",
    "the klein - gordon equation of motion for a scalar field @xmath0 with mass @xmath1 in a space - time with metric @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath3 writing @xmath4 to split the temporal , angular and radial parts of the field ( where @xmath5 are the spherical harmonics ) , the radial function @xmath6 obeys , in a @xmath7dimensional schwarzschild background , @xmath8r(r)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is defined by the metric @xmath10 ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein for a description of the general techniques associated with quantum fields in a schwarzschild spacetime used throughout this paper ) . under the change of variables @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the tortoise coordinate ( such that @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 , this equation takes a schrdinger - like form @xmath16 with a potential @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the schwarzschild radius and @xmath19 for the angular quantum number .",
    "the usual quantum mechanical techniques can therefore be employed in the tortoise coordinate system .",
    "the chandrasekhar convention is used hereafter : the last term of equation ( [ tort ] ) is interpreted as the squared potential so as to recover the standard hamilton - jacobi equation . on fig .",
    "[ pot - gen ] , @xmath20 is shown for three different values of the mass ( @xmath21 $ ] ) and two values of the angular momentum ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "depending on @xmath1 and @xmath19 , it can be seen that a local minimum , potentially leading to a bound state , eventually appears .",
    "the existence of a potential well depends on the roots of the algebrac equation @xmath24  : @xmath25 two roots above @xmath18 exist if the mass @xmath1 is lower than a critical value @xmath26 given by @xmath27with @xmath28.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the monopolar case ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ) , it takes the simple value @xmath29 .",
    "this allows one to understand easily the general behavior of the potential .",
    "let us consider a particle with a given mass @xmath30 and a black hole with a horizon radius @xmath31 .",
    "the mass of the particle may be smaller than @xmath32 . in this case ,",
    "the local barrier and the potential well do exist for all the values of the orbital quantum number , and particles can be potentially trapped with any angular momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath30 is greater than @xmath32 , then the @xmath19-domain has to be divided into two subclasses . a critical value of the orbital quantum number , denoted @xmath33 ,",
    "can then be defined by @xmath34 .",
    "for all the partial waves with an orbital quantum number smaller or equal to this critical value , the potential appears as a monotonically increasing function of @xmath35 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "however , all the partial waves with @xmath38 will face the local barrier as well as the well potential .     and two values of the angular quantum number @xmath19 ( in each case , @xmath22 for the lower curve and @xmath23 for the upper curve ) .",
    "]    the detailed shape of the potential is also determined by another critical mass , hereafter called @xmath39 , which defines the relative height of the potential barrier close to the horizon when compared with the mass of the particle . if the mass of the particle is higher than the barrier , there is no more a turning point for the system .",
    "the mass is the highest value of the potential if the equation @xmath40 has no root above @xmath18 .",
    "the cubic form @xmath41 satisfies this criterion if @xmath42 , which is then given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the monopolar case , it becomes @xmath45 .",
    "table [ mass ] provides the values of the critical masses in units of @xmath46 .",
    ".critical masses in units of @xmath46 for different angular quantum numbers . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     most _ very _ massive particles ( like the top quark or w boson ) are unstable and will decay before reaching infinity or creating a substantial halo around the hole .",
    "this point should , however , not prevent us from considering bound states associated with lighter stable particles , as the relevant parameter for the bound states to exist is not the mass of the field in itself , but the hierarchy between this mass and the mass of the hole .",
    "as far as the field is not strictly massless , there will be a black hole masse range where @xmath1 becomes close to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , making the trapping effective .",
    "an important issue to address is related to the time stability of those bound states . by integrating the hawking instantaneous energy spectrum and summing over all the degrees of freedom of the standard model of particle physics , it is easy to show that the mean time between the emission of two quanta is , in planck units , @xmath49 .",
    "if we consider , _",
    "e.g. _ , electrons emitted by a black hole such that @xmath50 , this leads to @xmath51s ; this remains tiny when compared to the time - scale of the black hole evolution .",
    "in other words , as the energy carried out from the hole by each emitted particle @xmath52 is much smaller than the mass of the hole , many quanta can be emitted and trapped before the structure of the potential will have substantially changed .",
    "this is , of course , not true anymore when @xmath53 , that is to say in the planck regime in which the semi - classical approximation breaks down anyway .",
    "the existence of bound states will play an important role in the hawking evaporation mechanism which was initially described in @xcite without taking into account this phenomenon .",
    "first , some low - energy particles will be trapped by the potential well .",
    "they will not reach infinity and the spectrum will be modified in a way quite similar to what could happen due to a qcd halo @xcite .",
    "when the black hole evaporates , new bound states will appear each time the temperature becomes of the same order than the critical masses @xmath54 associated with existing particles .",
    "at the first level of approximation , the number of particles within the well per unit of time and energy , @xmath55 , at a given energy is given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 $ ] representing the ingoing one due to the hawking evaporation , and @xmath58 the outgoing one .",
    "the energy - dependent time constant @xmath59 simply corresponds to the lifetime of the bound state .",
    "this simple model for the number of particles trapped in a local well is realistic only in the case of heavy black holes which can be considered as stationary ( the small amount of energy carried out by emitted particles being much smaller that the mass of the black hole ) . with @xmath60 the initial amount of trapped particles , the time evolution is simply given by @xmath61 which can be clearly understood as competition between particles `` leaking '' from the well to the hole and particles `` filling '' the well because of the hawking radiation .",
    "quickly the number of trapped particles reaches an equilibrium regime with @xmath62 .",
    "it is worth noticing that once the equilibrium regime is reached , the number of trapped particles does not depend on @xmath63 but only on the energy and on the temperature of the black hole .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that the probability to cross the potential barrier is the same for incoming and outgoing particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the equilibrium regime , given by the ratio of the number of particles scattering the off barrier from the left and the number of particles scattering off the barrier from the right , does not depend on the lifetime of the bound states .",
    "it is important to compare the characteristic time to reach this regime with the characteristic evolution time of the black hole . for monopolar bound states , which are dominant , and for particles with masses below @xmath48 , the lifetime ranges between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this time - scale is of the same order as the typical time - scale between two successive emissions of a particle , which , as already mentioned in this article , is much smaller than the evolution time - scale for the black hole itself .",
    "this makes meaningful our hypothesis of _ non - evolutionary black holes _ : as long as heavy black holes are considered , enough particles are emitted to reach the equilibrium regime without any substantial modifications of the properties of the black hole . the expected number of trapped particles when the equilibrium regime is reached is also given in table [ spect - mass ] in units of @xmath46 , per unit of energy and time .",
    "as can be seen from this table , the mean number of particles decreases as the mass of the particle increases , since higher energy bound states are involved .",
    "the mass of the particle will also drastically modify the greybody factors that account for the non - trivial part ( gravitational barrier and centrifugal potential ) of the couplings between quantum fields and evaporating black holes .",
    "the greybody factors ( whose detailed study began with @xcite followed by @xcite ) have recently been computed in quite a lot of interesting situations  : extradimensions @xcite , de - sitter spacetime @xcite , rotating black holes @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite etc . , but up to now the masses of the emitted particles have mostly been ignored ( although some good estimates were obtained in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ grey - num ] displays the absorption cross section numerically computed by solving the klein - gordon equation to evaluate the ingoing and outgoing amplitudes of the wave function at the horizon and at spatial infinity ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a detailed description of the method we have developed ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that those cross sections have been computed for particles with an energy greater than or equal to the mass .",
    "particles with an energy smaller than the mass will face an infinitely thick potential barrier , precisely due to the mass term in the potential , and will never reach spatial infinity .",
    "it should also be noticed that , when the wavelength of the particle becomes infinite , the cross section diverges , potentially leading to an experimentally relevant enhancement of soft quanta .",
    "it can indeed be expressed as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the momentum ( so that @xmath68 at spatial infinity ) and @xmath69 is the transmission coefficient .",
    "however , the transmission coefficient remains always smaller than or equal to unity and the divergence lies in _",
    "geometrical issues_. when @xmath70 , the wave number of the particle tends to zero , whereas the transmission coefficient is non - vanishing , just because the potential barrier is not infinitely thick ( the barrier precisely stops where the potential well starts and the potential tends asymptotically to @xmath1 with negative values ) .",
    "this leads to a @xmath71 divergence .",
    "the situation is clearly different for massless particles . in this case",
    ", the potential barrier tends asymptotically to zero with _ positive values _ , leading to @xmath72 when @xmath73 .",
    "this feature prevents the ir divergence from occurring for massless particles .",
    "those results are in agreement with analytical investigations in the ir regime , @xmath74 , as obtained following @xcite .    in fig  [ flux ] ,",
    "the flux at infinity emitted by a black hole is plotted when the masses of the emitted quanta are taken into account .",
    "as can be seen , this substantially modifies the usual picture both because of the intrinsic cutoff imposed by the mass and because of more subtle effects included in this analysis , like the selection induced on the allowed quantum multipolar orders of the outgoing particle . from fig  [ flux ]",
    ", it can be seen that the radiation flux decreases for higher masses .",
    "however , in the ir limit , this tendency should change , as can be seen using the analytical limit @xmath75 obtained from @xcite .",
    "the flux is non - vanishing only if the mass of the particle is non - vanishing , enhancing the emission of ultra - soft quanta , just as for schwarzschild - de sitter black holes @xcite .     as a function of the energy measured at infinity . ]",
    "this study establishes the existence of new bound states around black holes which , at least at the dominant monopolar order , have no classical equivalent .",
    "although such states are known to exist in other physical systems , this opens new perspectives to investigate the detailed features of the hawking spectrum ( with possible cosmological consequences related , _",
    "e.g. _ , to the primordial power spectrum see @xcite for recent limits and @xcite for a review ) , the intricate shape of the greybody factors and the propagation of massive quantum fields in the vicinity of a black hole . not only could the phenomenology be revised as the spectra should be quantitatively modified but fruitful thought experiments associated with light black holes should also take into account those states .",
    "the intricate problem of backreaction should however be addressed and requires an exhaustive study in itself .",
