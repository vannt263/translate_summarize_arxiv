    "when did the first galaxy disks form ? how did they evolve ?",
    "these fundamental questions may be addressed by studying barred spiral galaxies . over the last three decades",
    ", various studies have shown that any massive , rotationally - supported , and dynamically cold disk should be unstable to bar formation ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) ; recent studies indicate that even in massive dark matter halos , large bars may form easily @xcite .",
    "transient bars may also form in mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "bars have a significant impact on the subsequent evolution of the disk .",
    "bars transport massive amounts of gas to the centers @xcite , ignite circumnuclear starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , and reduce the chemical abundance gradient @xcite .",
    "various models have indicated that the bar instability may be accompanied by bulge formation @xcite ; bulges may also evolve by gas transported inwards by the bar @xcite .",
    "thus the presence and cosmological evolution of barred spirals is integral to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .    before the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , morphological studies of nascent=70,@xmath3=0.3 , @xmath4=0.7 throughout this _",
    "letter_. in this cosmology z=1 corresponds to 7.7 gyr ago . ]",
    "galaxy disks were difficult . at high redshifts one expected barred galaxies to be fairly common because hierarchical clustering models indicated dynamically colder disks ( e.g. , @xcite , but see their caveats ) .",
    "also mergers were more frequent in the past ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it was a stunning surprise when the pioneering studies of galaxy morphology with the hubble deep fields ( hdf ) found a paucity of barred spirals beyond z@xmath20.50.7 @xcite .",
    "analysis with the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey was also consistent with these conclusions @xcite . however , @xcite showed one example where a bar was clearly evident in a nicmos ( 1.6@xmath1 ) image , but not in the optical hdf data",
    ". could the decline in bars be an observational bias ?",
    "this question is the focal point of this _",
    "letter_.    we use nicmos hdfn images to investigate the bar fraction at z @xmath0 0.7 .",
    "in addition to the expected effect of bandshifting , we show how limited spatial resolution can limit the identification of bars .",
    "we find that the fraction of large bars at z @xmath0 0.7 may be higher than that seen in the local universe and discuss the implications in  [ impl ] .      for studying barred spirals at high redshifts ( z @xmath0 0.7 )",
    ", the nicmos hdf dataset is ideal because it provides rest - frame v through i - band images of galaxies",
    ". the better visibility of bars at longer wavelengths is a well - known effect ; unlike spiral arms which are dominated by blue light from massive , young stars , bars are primarily composed of old , red , low - mass stars , best traced in the infrared .",
    "another important consideration is the non - uniform dust obscuration and peculiar star formation morphology in bars .",
    "early type barred spirals are often completely devoid of star formation activity in the bar , making the bar invisible in blue and ultra - violet bands ; only in the i - band images does a bar become visible .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure [ fig4303 ] .",
    "these effects become important with increasing z because at z=0.7 , the reddest wfpc2 filter , f814w , observes rest - frame @xmath55000  making it difficult to detect a barred galaxy .",
    "[ fig4303 ]",
    "there are 904 galaxies with photometric or spectroscopic redshifts in the hdfn . of these , 206 are at z @xmath6 0.7 , 226 are at 0.7 @xmath6 z @xmath6 1.1 , and the remaining 472 are at z @xmath0 1.1 .",
    "we made postage stamp images of each of these galaxies in the optical and near - infrared hdf data , examined each galaxy individually in the v ( f606w ) , i ( f814w ) and h ( f160w ) bands , and identified a candidate sample of 136 galaxies ( 41 at z @xmath6 0.7 , 50 at 0.7 @xmath6 z @xmath6 1.1 ) with resolved disk morphology .",
    "bars are characterized by isophotes that have a relatively constant position angle and a monotonically increasing ellipticity . at the end of the bar",
    "the ellipticity drops sharply , and the position angle changes as the isophotes belonging to the underlying disk are fitted .",
    "for each of the 136 galaxies , we used the standard ellipse routine in iraf to fit the isophotes with ellipses to identify bars .",
    "this technique , described by @xcite , is perhaps the most widely used technique for identifying bars @xcite .",
    "however , bars may be missed if the galaxy is highly inclined , if the bar position angle is the same as the galactic disk , if the underlying galactic disk is too faint to be adequately imaged , or if the data have inadequate resolution to resolve bars .",
    "all of these effects _ reduce _ the fraction of observed barred spirals .",
    "we emphasize that the ellipse fitting technique is unlikely to overestimate the fraction of barred galaxies .    at z @xmath6 0.7",
    ", we identify five barred spirals , and two candidate barred spirals , consistent with the prior analysis of the hdfn by @xcite , who also found seven barred galaxies at z @xmath6 0.7 .",
    "this agreement is not surprising because in this redshift range the bandshifting effects are not severe .",
    "[ bargal ]    in the redshift range , z @xmath0 0.7 we identify four barred spirals and five candidate barred spirals , including two possible candidates at z=1.66 and z=2.37 .",
    "the four barred spirals are shown in figure [ bargal ] ; their properties are listed in table [ bartab ] . for comparison ,",
    "in the previous wfpc2 hdfn studies , @xcite found no barred spirals , and @xcite found only two barred galaxies beyond z@xmath20.5 ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that our criteria are even more conservative than those used by @xcite who identified bars by calculating a bar axial ratio parameter from only one outer and one inner isophote , and the difference in the position angles of the two isophotes ; we use ellipse fitting over the entire image to determine the existence of the bar .",
    "in fact , if we apply the @xcite magnitude cutoff of i(ab)=23.7 , the total number of disk - like galaxies drops to only 31 galaxies at z @xmath0 0.7 . among these",
    "we would identify three barred spirals . as we discuss later",
    ", this fraction of barred spirals is consistent with the fraction of bars not declining at z @xmath0 0.7 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that we are studying galaxies , not in the i - band , but in the h - band , where typical disks are @xmath22 magnitudes brighter .",
    "nevertheless , we detect only a few barred spirals .",
    "does this reflect a true decline in barred spirals beyond z @xmath0 0.7 , as has been suggested previously ?      in figure [ angsize ] , we show the apparent angular size of various galactic structures as a function of redshift . overlaid",
    "are detection limits for various telescopes adopting a five psf detection threshold .",
    "a typical bar in the nearby universe has a size of 5 kpc @xcite . at z @xmath0 0.7",
    ", the 0.8@xmath1 wfpc2 data is only marginally capable of detecting such bars .",
    "combined with the bandshifting effect , it is thus not surprising that the optical hdf data showed a decline in the bar fraction at z @xmath0 0.7 .",
    "[ angsize ]    the nicmos data are not affected by bandshifting until z @xmath0 23 ; however , these data have even lower resolution than the wfpc2 data due to the longer wavelengths and larger pixel size .",
    "the nicmos data can therefore only detect the largest bars .",
    "the average size of the four bars identified at z @xmath0 0.7 is 12 kpc .",
    "how common are large bars in the local universe ? in a representative survey of nearby spiral galaxies ( song , @xcite ) , there is only one bar out of 44 spirals with a size larger than 12 kpc @xcite .",
    "this sample was chosen using the following criteria : all spiral galaxies with m@xmath7 21.3 , @xmath870@xmath9 , @xmath10 20@xmath9 , and v@xmath11 2000 km  s@xmath12 . in nearby spirals ,",
    "the bar size is correlated with bulge size @xcite , but little else is known about the properties of galaxies that host the largest bars .    to study the bar fraction at z @xmath0 0.7",
    ", one would ideally like to define a comparable sample .",
    "however , galaxies at high redshift have properties that are not yet fully understood .",
    "for instance , the fraction of irregular or anomalous objects increases with redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in a study of seven high redshift spirals ,",
    "@xcite find m / l ratios that are comparable to local galaxies , but their analysis indicates that a fraction of the light must originate from a thick disk / bulge , or a significant amount of dark matter must be present in the luminous regions . for a given luminosity , disks appear to be more compact @xcite ; yet , it is unclear whether massive disks were in place at z@xmath21 , evolving only passively in luminosity @xcite , or whether significant evolution has occurred @xcite .    keeping these caveats in mind",
    ", we consider the fraction of bars in galaxies with disk - like morphologies ( 95 galaxies at z @xmath0 0.7 ) .",
    "compared to the song data , the nicmos data are , in fact , more sensitive . on average , galaxies with h(ab)=26.1 ( m@xmath13=16 at z@xmath21 , using a sb spectrum @xcite ) in the nicmos hdfn are imaged with a s / n@xmath210 @xcite .",
    "hence the observed fraction of barred spirals in the nicmos hdfn is lower than would have been observed with a similar magnitude cutoff . as noted earlier , if we were to apply a magnitude cutoff similar to @xcite , we would find three barred spirals out of 31 galaxies .",
    "thus , our finding of four large bars among 95 galaxies , or three out of 31 , indicates that the fraction of large bars at z @xmath0 0.7 seems to be higher than that found in the local universe ; all of the known selection effects bias us towards a lower limit to the bar fraction .",
    "we conclude that the fraction of large barred spiral galaxies is not declining at z @xmath0 0.7 , as previously claimed .",
    "observational biases limit us to only identifying the largest bars at high redshifts .",
    "though there are significant caveats ( small numbers , difficulty in defining comparable samples at high and low redshifts ) , the data suggest that the fraction of large bars at z@xmath21 may be higher than that seen in the local universe .",
    "if the bars we see at z@xmath21 formed from the bar instability , then one could infer that cold , rotationally - supported massive disks were present at least 7 gyr ago .",
    "it is equally , perhaps more , likely that these bars formed from interactions ; however , without additional data ( e.g. , observations of gas kinematics in the outer parts of the disk ) , it is difficult to distinguish between the two formation scenarios .",
    "if these are merger - induced bars , they indicate that at least some _ large _ disks were present at z@xmath21 .",
    "bars induced by interactions are likely to be transient phenomena ; nevertheless , their presence at z@xmath21 suggests that they may have played an important role in the evolution of galaxy disks , as noted in  [ intro ] .",
    "at z @xmath6 0.7 , we find the same number of bars as seen in previous optical studies .",
    "this is not surprising because bandshifting and resolution are not a problem at these redshifts . at z @xmath0 0.7",
    ", we identify four barred spirals , doubling the number previously seen .",
    "this result reiterates the known bandshifting effect in identification of barred spirals .",
    "poor spatial resolution can also lead to an underestimation of the bar fraction . at 0.8@xmath1 , wfpc2 is only marginally capable of detecting the typical 5 kpc bar beyond z@xmath20.7 . although the nicmos data can compensate for bandshifting , they have even poorer resolution than wfpc2 and are sensitive only to the largest bars .",
    "the four bars at z @xmath0 0.7 have an average size of 12 kpc .    at z @xmath0 0.7",
    "the observed fraction of bars is 4/95 galaxies ; all known selection effects indicate that this fraction is a lower limit .",
    "this fraction is _ higher _ than that seen in the local universe ( 1/44 ) for similarly sized bars .",
    "but there are significant caveats , e.g. , small numbers , and difficulties in defining comparable samples at high and low redshifts .",
    "we conclude that there is no significant evidence for a decrease in barred spirals beyond z@xmath20.7 .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish whether these bars formed in mergers or from a dynamical instability in the disk .",
    "if it is the latter , then their presence indicates that cold , massive disks were already present at z@xmath21 , consistent with star formation history .",
    "if it is the former , then they indicate that large disks were present at z@xmath21 , and bars probably played an important role in the evolution of the galactic disks , and perhaps bulge formation .",
    "further data are necessary to fully constrain the cosmological evolution of barred spirals .",
