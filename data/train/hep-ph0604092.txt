    "one of the features of polarized dis is that a lot of the present data are in the preasymptotic region ( @xmath4 ) . while in the unpolarized case we can cut the low @xmath2 and @xmath5 data in order to minimize the less known higher twist effects",
    ", it is impossible to perform such a procedure for the present data on the spin - dependent structure functions without losing too much information .",
    "this is especially the case for the hermes , slac and jefferson lab experiments .",
    "so , to confront correctly the qcd predictions with the experimental data and to determine the _ polarized _ parton densities special attention must be paid to higher twist ( powers in @xmath6 ) corrections to the nucleon structure functions .",
    "the latter are non - perturbative effects and can not be calculated without using models .",
    "that is why a _ model independent _ extraction of the dynamical higher twists from the experimental data is important not only for a better determination of the polarized parton densities but also because it would lead to interesting tests of the non - perturbative qcd regime and , in particular , of the quark - hadron duality .    before one can properly obtain information on the higher twist contribution ,",
    "it is important to take into account in the analysis the so - called target mass corrections ( tmcs ) arising from purely kinematic effects associated with finite values of the quantity @xmath7 .",
    "these are also powers in @xmath6 corrections , however formally related to the twist - two operators and therefore , unlike the higher twist ones , can be calculated without using models . in this note",
    "we present numerical results which illustrate the main features of the tmcs to the spin structure function @xmath0 valid in the preasymptotic dis region .",
    "we consider that their knowledge is useful and important in the qcd analyses of the present and future data on polarized dis at moderate energies .",
    "let us now discuss the numerical results on the target mass corrections to the spin structure function @xmath0 . in our analysis we will mainly concentrate on their features in the preasymptotic dis region ( the invariant mass @xmath19 and moderate values of @xmath20 ) . in the calculations of the target",
    "mass effects we have used for @xmath17 our recent nlo results from @xmath21 fit presented in @xcite . for the further discussion it is useful to rewrite ( [ g1tmc ] ) in the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23    the questions we address here are _",
    "i ) _ how large are the target mass effects in the preasymptotic dis region and _ ii ) _ how fast the series ( [ g1tmc ] ) converges , or in other words how large is the difference between @xmath24 calculated by ( [ g1tmctot ] ) and @xmath25 obtained when the tmcs are calculated only up to the first order in @xmath26 ( the first two terms in ( [ g1tmc ] ) or equivalently , in ( [ g1tmc1 ] ) ) . we will focus on the proton target , but in the end of our discussion we will mention also our results concerning the neutron spin structure function @xmath27 .",
    "note that it is of interest from a theoretical point of view to examine the convergence of the tmcs irrespective to the size of the dynamical ht . for practical purposes , however , there is no sense to use the exact formula ( [ g1tmctot ] ) in the analysis of the experimental data if the dynamical ht are not negligible to those of the tmcs . in this case",
    "the target mass and dynamical higher twist corrections have to be taken into account up to the same finite order in @xmath28 .",
    "the target mass corrections at fixed order in @xmath26 in the expansion ( [ g1tmc1 ] ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 where the notations @xmath29 are used .",
    "the tmcs are given outside the resonance region , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , at different fixed values of @xmath32 ( black curves ) , @xmath33 ( red curves ) and @xmath34 ( green curves ) .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "1 that the series ( [ g1tmc ] ) , or equivalently ( [ g1tmc1 ] ) , is an alternating series and the size of tmcs of higher then the first order in @xmath26 are small , especially the target mass corrections of third order in @xmath26 , @xmath35 , which are smaller than @xmath36 .    = 3.8 in    in order to estimate the target mass effects in the preasymptotic dis region we demonstrate also the relative changes of @xmath37 taking into account tmcs up to order @xmath38 , @xmath39 and all orders of @xmath40 ( eq .",
    "[ g1tmctot ] ) .",
    "these effects are presented for @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , respectively .",
    "the notations used in these figures are as follows : @xmath44 \\nonumber g_1^{{\\rm tmc},q^6}&=&g_1(m=0 ) + \\sum _ { j=1}^{3 } \\left ( { m^2\\over q^2}\\right ) ^jg_1^{(j)\\rm tmc},\\\\[3 mm ] g_1^{\\rm tmc , tot}&=&g_1^{\\rm tmc}({\\rm eq.~ 3 } ) .",
    "\\label{g1q2q6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that to calculate @xmath45 we have used the prescription given in @xcite that @xmath46 in the rhs of eq . [ g1tmctot ] vanishes for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "= 3.3 in    in figures 2 and 3 the dot , dashed and solid curves correspond to the change of @xmath0 proton when the first , third and all orders in @xmath26 , respectively , are taken into account . as seen from these figures , the sign of the target mass corrections depends on the @xmath49 region and the maximum change of the magnitude of @xmath0 due to the first order tmcs is 3.6% at @xmath50 , 6% at @xmath51 and 28.6% at @xmath52 are generally small was first established in @xcite . ] .",
    "the tm effects are large in the large @xmath49 and small @xmath2 region . however , because of the cut @xmath30 , the large @xmath49 region at small @xmath2 is outside of the preasymptotic dis region and their effects are much smaller than those in the resonance one .",
    "one can see also from figs . 2 and 3 that taking into account a first order tmcs to @xmath0 a good approximation of the exact equation ( [ g1tmc ] ) is already achieved .",
    "the deviation of this approximation of @xmath0 from @xmath45 , is not more than 1.5% for @xmath50 , 0.8% for @xmath51 and 1.8% for @xmath53 .",
    "the dashed curves , which correspond to @xmath54 ( the tmcs are taken into account up to a third order in @xmath40 ) , practically coincide with @xmath55 ( solid curves ) , especially in the cases of @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "this observation is a consequence of the fact we have already discussed above that the series of the target mass corrections ( [ g1tmc ] ) is an alternative sign one .",
    "= 3.0 in = 3.0 in    in fig .",
    "4 we compare the tmcs to neutron spin structure function @xmath27 with those to @xmath37 . as seen from fig .",
    "4 its magnitude is much smaller than that one in the proton case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the negative @xmath56 crosses zero at @xmath57 and becomes positive at @xmath49 higher than 0.4 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the values of the moments of @xmath56 in the rhs of ( [ g1tmc ] ) are much smaller than those of @xmath37 .",
    "the main conclusion about the proton tmcs , namely , that the first order tmcs is a good approximation of their total account , holds for the neutron target too .",
    "= 3.2 in    finally , we would like to compare the size of the tmcs with that of the higher twist power corrections to the spin structure function @xmath0 .",
    "taking into account only the first order corrections in @xmath6 , @xmath0 has the following form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the dynamical higher twist ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) corrections to @xmath0 , which are related to multi - parton correlations in the nucleon .",
    "the latter are non - perturbative effects and can not be calculated without using models .    in fig .",
    "5 we compare the first order tmcs , @xmath62  ( see eq .",
    "[ notation ] ) , with the values of the ht corrections , @xmath63 , extracted in a model independent way from the world data on polarized dis @xcite .",
    "one can see from fig . 5",
    "that : _ i ) _ in the neutron case the target mass contribution in @xmath0 is negligible compared to the higher twist effects and _ ii ) _ in the proton case the tmcs are essential at @xmath64 while for @xmath65 their magnitude is much smaller than that of the ht corrections .",
    "note also the different shapes of tm and ht corrections .",
    "= 3.0 in = 3.0 in    as a result of this analysis we conclude that in the preasymptotic dis region the higher twist contribution in @xmath0 becomes more and more important , so the tmcs can not be trusted alone .",
    "we have studied the target mass effects in polarized dis scattering which would be important in preasymptotic region .",
    "it was demonstrated that accounting for the first order target mass corrections to @xmath0 a very good approximation of the exact formula ( [ g1tmctot ] ) is achieved .",
    "it was also shown that the size of the tmcs in the preasymptotic dis region is small ( @xmath66 ) except for @xmath67 where their effect is a partially suppressed by the large values of @xmath2 due to the cut @xmath68 .",
    "compared to the higher twist effects the contribution of target mass corrections to the spin structure function @xmath0 in the preasymptotic dis region is insignificant except for @xmath64 in the proton case . nevertheless , to extract correctly the unknown high twist effects from the experimental data , the calculable target mass corrections to the spin structure functions should be taken into account .",
