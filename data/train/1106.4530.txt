    "the timings of transit or eclipse events in multibody astronomical systems provide a high precision measurement of the phase of the orbits of the transiting bodies  typically a few parts in 10@xmath1 or better .",
    "such high precision measurements allow for detailed studies of the dynamics of these systems through eclipse timing variations or etvs ( or transit timing variations , ttvs , for planetary systems ) @xcite .",
    "a variety of mechanisms can cause the eclipse times to deviate from a linear ephemeris including the rmer effect ( light travel time , or ltt ) , transverse displacements of the star with respect to the system barycentre , resonance interactions among the bodies , and effects that correspond to the synodic periods of the objects .",
    "a detailed discussion of these cases is found in @xcite .",
    "one notable cause of etvs is the effect of a changing tidal field on a binary pair due to a perturber on a hierarchical , eccentric orbit .",
    "this scenario was derived analytically in @xcite and a simplified derivation is shown in @xcite .",
    "basically , when the perturbing third object is far from its short - period binary companions , the period of the binary is largely unmodified .",
    "however , when the perturbing object is near the binary and near the binary s orbital plane , its presence slows the orbital period of the binary . the result is a periodic ttv signal with a period equal to the orbit time of the perturbing body .",
    "the more eccentric the orbit , the larger and more asymmetric the ttv signal appears because the slowing of the binary s orbital period at the perturber s pericentre passage takes a smaller fraction of its orbital period and the large change in proximity from the high eccentricity exaggerates the change in the binary s period .",
    "the nature of this signal is such that it is virtually independent of the azimuthal orientation of the apse of the orbit of the perturbing body , though it does depend upon the mutual inclination of the two relevant orbital planes .",
    "the first system known to exhibit this effect , also found with _",
    "photometric data , is the triple star system koi 646 ( kic 5384802 , * ? ? ?",
    "here we present and discuss a second stellar system that shows a periodic etv signal consistent with this same model , koi 928 ( kic 9140402 ) .",
    "a third _ kepler _  system that shows similar orbital architecture , but that is viewed in a different orientation  and thus does not show the same etv signal , is koi 126 ( kic 5897826 , * ? ? ?",
    "additional star systems that show trends indicative of dynamical interactions were reported in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ photometry ]",
    "we present the _ kepler _  photometry and transit times . in section [ spectroscopy ]",
    "we outline the spectroscopically derived stellar parameters and radial velocity ( rv ) measurements of the target star .",
    "section [ analysis ] gives the dynamical analysis of the transit times and radial velocity measurements of the system .",
    "concluding remarks are in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we note that the true orbital structure of these systems is a bright central star orbited by an eclipsing binary of low mass stars .",
    "however , for the purposes of our discussion we will label the eclipsing binary as the `` inner binary '' of objects one and two and the third star , which perturbs the orbital period of the inner binary , as the third or `` outer '' object .",
    "koi 928 ( kic 9140402 ) has _ kepler _  magnitude kp = 15.251 , making it quite dim among _ kepler _  targets .",
    "it is located at ra 18:59:02.26 and dec 45:35:56.86 . for our study",
    ", we use data from the first six quarters of _ kepler _  operations ( bjd 2454968  2455650 ) corresponding to nearly 700 days of observation .",
    "information about the _ kepler _",
    "spacecraft and its performance can be found in @xcite .",
    "the period of the eclipse events is 4.98829 days and the eclipse depths are 0.06% of the nominal flux . a binned lightcurve and representative model ( generated using the phoebe software from @xcite ) , is shown in figure [ timeseries ] .    ) and mass ( @xmath2 ) members of the binary.[timeseries ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this system was initially identified as a planetary candidate through the transiting planet search and the data validation pipelines @xcite which identify significant transit - like features and conduct a battery of statistical tests on those transit events in an effort to rule out false - positive transit signals .",
    "as data for koi 928 were being analyzed , the interpretation of the system quickly grew complicated .",
    "the transit times showed a sizeable , roughly sinusoidal timing variations with nearly a two - hour peak - to - peak amplitude ( consistent with a near - resonant two - planet system ) .",
    "however , intial rv measuremen nts ( described in the next section ) differed significantly from the predictions of a two - planet model .",
    "a psf fit to the difference image formed by subtracting averaged in - transit pixels from averaged out - of - transit pixels ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicated no significant centroid motion .",
    "this fact effectively eliminates the possibility of the transits being on a star that is more distant than 0.3 pixels ( 1.2  ) from koi-928 .",
    "taken together , with a few additional rv data , the information suggests a model of a bright star being orbited by a low - mass binary pair .",
    "attempts to model the eclipse times of this system suffer both from the lack of photons ( given the dimness of the target ) as well as additional systematic errors . in particular , some estimates of the eclipse times show multiple local minima while others have unusually large error bars .",
    "consequently , we derived the eclipse times and their uncertainties using two different methods ( described below ) .",
    "we then adopt one set of times as `` nominal '' , but eliminate eclipses at certain epochs based upon the estimated errors and the differences between the two methods .",
    "times from the second method are not analyzed in the dynamical model .    to estimate the nominal eclipse times for both the members of the eclipsing binary , we fit standard 4@xmath3 order non - linear limb - darkened eclipse models @xcite to the kepler light curve .",
    "for each primary or secondary eclipse , the model allowed for independent values of the primary - secondary radius ratio , eclipse duration , and impact parameter . for each eclipse",
    ", we fit for the flux normalization and a local linear slope in the flux and we numerically average the model over the 30 minute integration duration .    the first step to determine the eclipse times is to fit a single model to the set of all eclipses for each individual star assuming a constant orbital period .",
    "second , we hold the radius ratio , eclipse duration , and impact parameter fixed , and fit a small segment of the light curve around each eclipse for the remaining parameters .",
    "third , we phase the light curve using each measured eclipse and refit for the eclipse parameters ( aside from period and epoch ) .",
    "the second and third steps are iterated to converge on a final model .",
    "this model also includes a nuisance parameter which estimates the `` contamination '' light from stars in the kepler aperture ( excluding the star being eclipsed ) as a fixed parameter .",
    "we verified that our results for eclipse times are not sensitive to the value of this nuisance parameter .",
    "the second , comparative set of eclipse time estimates were calculated using an iterative process starting with an initial linear ephemeris and eclipse width . eclipses in the `` raw '' data were masked , then the light curve was piecewise detrended and normalized locally ( 0.5 days ) using a cubic polynomial .",
    "all the eclipses were then folded on the ephemeris , and a piecewise cubic hermite spline was fitted using least - squares to the folded eclipse using observations that fell within a window of width @xmath4 the eclipse width + 1 cadence on each side .",
    "the cubic hermite spline was fit using 9 evenly spaced points across the window and the @xmath5 of the fit recorded .",
    "the cubic hermite was refit 25 more times using odd numbers ( 11 - 35 ) of spline knots .",
    "the best fit from these 26 cases defined the eclipse template , and the eclipse width estimate was updated using this template .",
    "the light curve was again detrended locally using a cubic polynomial but now using three different out - of - eclipse lengths : 7.5 hours , 15 hours , and 20 hours .",
    "for each of the three out - of - eclipse lengths , the template was correlated with the eclipse at 1000 time steps , spanning 115 min .",
    "the estimate for the mid - eclipse time is that which gave the minimum @xmath5 value over the three different out - of - eclipse lengths .",
    "this entire process was iterated using the new eclipse time estimates , but those eclipses with a reduced @xmath6 were eliminated from the template building step , and the correlation time step length was reduced by a factor of 8 .",
    "once the second iteration was completed , the uncertainties in eclipse times were estimated using the @xmath5 curve of the fits .    to select the eclipse times from the nominal ( first ) method to used in our analysis , we rejected those epochs where either of the two methods had large uncertainties ( greater than 0.045 days ) and the epochs where the two methods disagree by more than 3@xmath7 .",
    "the epochs that survive these cuts were analyzed .",
    "these two criteria were determined by analyzing the distribution of the differences in the eclipse times of the two models and the distribution of the uncertainties in the eclipse times .",
    "in both cases ( the cut on uncertainty and the cut on difference ) there is an obvious gap where the outlier population dominates over the nominal distribution and the chosen cuts reflect those transitions .",
    "the eclipse times used for this analysis are given in the appendix .",
    "we obtained seven high - resolution spectra of koi 928 in order to measure improved stellar properties of the bright , outer star and to place radial velocity constraints on its orbit .",
    "six spectra were taken with the tull coud spectrograph on the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope at the mcdonald observatory in west texas , which has a resolving power of @xmath8 and wavelength coverage @xmath9  .",
    "one additional spectrum was taken with the fiber - fed echelle spectrograph ( fies ) on the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) at la palma , spain @xcite .",
    "the fies spectrum was taken with the medium - resolution fiber , which has resolving power of @xmath10 and wavelength coverage @xmath11  .    in order to determine the effective temperature ( @xmath12 ) , projected rotational velocity ( @xmath13 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath14 ) , and metallicity",
    "( [ fe / h ] ) of the bright star in the system , we cross - correlated the strongest spectrum  the only one with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 20 per resolution element  against a grid of synthetic stellar spectra computed from kurucz models @xcite . a new set of tools @xcite",
    "was then used to derive more precise stellar parameters from the normalized cross correlation peaks .",
    "formally , the value of @xmath15 places the star below the isochrones in an unphysical part of the h - r diagram .",
    "this is most likely due to errors in the measured quantities and given the relatively low snr of our spectrum and the strong spectroscopic correlations between @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and [ fe / h ] , this is not surprising .",
    "however , the formal error in @xmath14 is large enough that there are valid solutions that do fall on the isochrones .",
    "the results from this analysis , with conservative uncertainties , are given in table [ stellarparams ] .    to obtain radial velocities",
    ", we performed a multi - order cross - correlation of the six mcdonald spectra following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "for the fies spectrum , we adopt the rv derived from cross - correlation against the best - matched synthetic template .",
    "the velocities are shifted onto the iau absolute scale as defined by the velocity of the iau rv standard hd 182488 @xcite .",
    "the errors have been inflated to include an instrumental component corresponding to the long term rms velocity residuals of hd 182488 as observed by each instrument .",
