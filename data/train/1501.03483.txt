    "the accuracy of this parametrization is similar to that of the three - center lmto hamiltonian , although they are not exactly equivalent . in the nearly orthogonal lmto basis ,",
    "the hamiltonian and overlap matrices are @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are diagonal matrices containing the linearization energies and the lmto parameters @xmath90 , and @xmath86 is the same as in ( [ h ] ) .",

    "third - order accuracy is similarly achieved by redefining the potential functions:@xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "these definitions are designed to preserve the relations ( [ deriv ] ) . if the third - order green s function @xmath97 is defined similarly to ( [ gf ] ) but with the third - order potential functions ( [ p3 ] ) , it can be shown that @xmath98    a solution of @xmath99 corresponds to a pole of @xmath97 , and the factors @xmath100 guarantee that the residue at that pole is equal to 1 .",
    "thus , the eigenstates of the three - center lmto hamiltonian are correctly represented by @xmath97 to third order in @xmath101 .",
    "the first term in ( [ g3 ] ) introduces two unphysical poles at @xmath102 for each orbital .",

    "( [ g3 ] ) for @xmath115 , which modifies the perturbed green s function @xmath116 .",
    "however , for spin - orbit coupling this modification may be neglected , as we now argue .",
    "let us denote @xmath117 and write down the diagrammatic expansion of @xmath116 in powers of @xmath106 .",
    "it is just a usual expansion in which each green s function line can be either @xmath118 or @xmath119 .",
    "now let us resum all diagram insertions with no external lines and no @xmath118 lines inside .",

    "up to similar corrections , the residues of the poles of @xmath116 are equal to those for @xmath129 .",
    "thus , neglecting all small terms or order @xmath131 compared to 1 , we find @xmath132 .    substituting the second term in ( [ g3 ] ) as @xmath118 in ( [ barg ] ) , we find the perturbed green s function : @xmath133 where we have dropped the inconsequential term @xmath119 .",
    "this expression for @xmath116 is equivalent to @xmath134 with redefined potential functions @xmath135 where instead of @xmath136 in ( [ cu ] ) we should use @xmath137    the self - energy matrix for spin - orbit coupling within the given @xmath138 subspace is defined as @xmath139 where the energy dependence of the coupling parameter @xmath140 comes from the radial wave functions .",
    "to second order in @xmath141 , the radial function in the lmto basis is @xmath142 .",

    "an approximate form can be obtained by neglecting the terms of order @xmath145 when they appear in the perturbation , i.  e.  approximating @xmath146 in ( [ tcv ] ) and neglecting the square root in the denominator of ( [ xiz ] ) .",
    "we found that for ( fe@xmath1co@xmath11)@xmath12b alloys this approximation captures all the essential physics ( see , for example , fig .  1 ) , while the @xmath145 terms only change @xmath0 by an average of about 10% .",
    "the above treatment of spin - orbit coupling is extended to cpa with no modifications .",
    "some implementation notes about our cpa code can be found in ref .  .",
    "when mca energy @xmath0 appears in second order in spin - orbit coupling , the anisotropy of the expectation value of the so operator @xmath26 is approximately equal to @xmath27.@xcite here we transcribe this relation in terms of green s functions .",
    "the single - particle energy is by definition @xmath147 the second - order term from perturbation theory is @xmath148 the expectation value of @xmath149 , with the radial integral included in @xmath106 , in the same order is @xmath150 an exact quasiparticle green s function with simple poles of unit residue satisfies @xmath151 . for @xmath115",
    "this identity is satisfied approximately up to a real term of second order in @xmath73 .",
    "thus , setting @xmath152 , we find @xmath153 where the first term was integrated by parts , and @xmath154 denotes the terms with the energy derivative of @xmath106 .",
    "for substitutional alloys treated in cpa , the green s function does not have a purely quasiparticle structure , and in general the relation @xmath151 is violated due to the energy dependence of the coherent potential .",
    "this energy dependence contributes additional terms to the right side of ( [ esp2 ] ) .",
    "however , here we are dealing with relatively weak substitutional fe / co disorder , and the electronic structure largely preserves its quasiparticle character .",
    "therefore , we may expect the relation @xmath155 to hold approximately , which is borne out by calculations .",
    "deviations from this relation can also occur near the points of degeneracy close to the fermi level , where second - order perturbation theory breaks down . as seen in fig .  4",
    ", this situation appears near @xmath6 where the fermi level cuts through a pair of flat , nearly degenerate bands . from fig .",
    "1 we see the largest difference between @xmath0 and @xmath14 at this point .",
    "orbital moments and their dependence on the direction of magnetization are often discussed in connection with mca .",
    "@xcite in ( fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3b both spin channels contribute comparably to @xmath0 , and therefore there is no direct relation between @xmath0 and the anisotropy of the total orbital moment .",
    "however , the spin - flip terms are small and change slowly when @xmath16 is not close to 1 ( see fig .  1 ) . since the energy dependence of the so parameters is relatively weak , the contributions @xmath36 and @xmath34 are closely related to the orbital moment anisotropy ( oma ) for the states of the corresponding spin . fig .",
    "[ orbital ] shows that the concentration - weighted average of the spin - down oma behaves similarly to @xmath34 .",
    "the spin - up oma is almost constant except for the co - rich end where , as seen in fig .  1",
    ", the spin - flip terms also increase substantially .",
    "note that negative oma for spin - up states corresponds to positive @xmath36 , but the sign of oma for spin - down states is the same as that of @xmath34 .",
    "this is because @xmath156 appears in @xmath14 with a minus sign , as reflected in hund s third rule .",
    "the concentration dependence of @xmath36 and of the majority - spin oma is weak because the majority - spin @xmath25 bands are fully filled .",
    "this feature is typical for fe , co , and ni - based magnetic alloys .",
    "therefore , while @xmath0 is almost never proportional to the total oma , their derivatives with respect to the concentration may be strongly correlated in many magnetic @xmath25 alloys ."

    "<S> we therefore considered the dependence of @xmath0 at @xmath5 on the volume - conserving tetragonal distortion . </S>",
    "<S> the results plotted in fig .  [ fig : kcoa ] show a very strong effect : @xmath0 is doubled under a modest 3% increase in @xmath7 due to the sharply increasing spin - flip contributions . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed analysis shows that the latter is largely due to the increase in the @xmath13 parameter . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the minority - spin contribution increases with decreasing volume . </S>",
    "<S> thus , increasing @xmath13 and decreasing @xmath71 both have a positive effect on mca . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement could be achieved through epitaxial multilayer engineering . </S>",
    "<S> the search for a suitable alloying element to enhance the @xmath7 ratio is an interesting subject for further investigation .     as a function of the @xmath7 ratio at @xmath5 ( the value @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> is assigned to the unstrained lattice ) . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are also shown . ]    in conclusion , we have explained how the spin reorientation transitions in ( fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3b alloys originate in the so selection rules and the consecutive filling of minority - spin electronic bands of particular orbital character . near the optimal 30% concentration of co , the mca energy is predicted to increase quickly with the @xmath7 ratio , which could be implemented by epitaxial strain or a suitable chemical doping .    </S>",
