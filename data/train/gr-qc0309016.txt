    "a central issue in the general relativistic theory of isolated systems is that of the verification of the so - called _ penrose proposal _ @xcite . following friedrich @xcite ,",
    "the proposal can be formulated as :    far fields of isolated systems behave like asymptotically simple spacetimes in the sense that they can be smoothly extended to null infinity after a suitable conformal rescaling .    that this proposal is not empty i.e . that there are examples of radiative spacetimes is known thanks to work by chruciel & delay @xcite",
    "the idea behind their result was to combine a modification of the gluing construction of corvino @xcite , which yields initial data which are schwarzschildean outside a compact set , with the semiglobal hyperboloidal existence result of friedrich @xcite .",
    "the resulting spacetime is then see figure [ chrusciel : fig] schwarzschildean in a region , @xmath0 , of spacetime `` near null and spatial infinity '' .",
    "however , at later times radiation could certainly be registered at null infinity . as emphasized by friedrich",
    ", the radiation content of this spacetime is rather special : the schwarzschildean nature of the initial data implies that newman - penrose constants of the spacetime are zero ; on the other hand , the newman - penrose constants are know to be equal to the value of the rescaled weyl tensor at timelike infinity @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "hence , the weyl tensor at @xmath1 vanishes for the chruciel - delay spacetimes , thus implying a fast decaying gravitational field at very late times .    in the light of the results by chruciel & delay it is natural to ask how general can be the behaviour of initial data in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity if one is to obtain asymptotically simple solutions . a first insight to this point",
    "was provided by the analysis of friedrich given in @xcite . in order to keep the discussions in a reasonable complexity level ,",
    "his analysis was restricted to time symmetric initial data with an analytic compactification at infinity .",
    "he found that a necessary condition in order to attain spacetimes that are smoothly extendible at null infinity is that the regularity condition @xmath2 is satisfied to all orders .",
    "if the condition is not satisfied at some order , then the solutions to the einstein field equations will develop logarithmic singularities at the `` sets where null infinity touches spatial infinity '' .",
    "it is worth making a couple of remarks about this condition : firstly , that it is a purely asymptotic condition , and thus it does not pose a big limitation on the kind of physical systems one would like to describe . secondly , it was proved in @xcite that static initial data satisfies the regularity condition .",
    "recent work by the author @xcite , using the techniques developed by friedrich in @xcite has shown that the regularity condition ( [ reg_cond ] ) is not a sufficient condition to ensure the smoothness of the null infinity arising from developments of the class of initial data under consideration time symmetric and with an analytic initial 3-metric near infinity .",
    "the analysis in @xcite considered asymptotic expansions near null and spatial infinity arising from time symmetric data which were further assumed to be conformally flat near infinity .",
    "the assumption of conformal flatness near infinity is in this context rather natural because it satisfies automatically the regularity condition ( [ reg_cond ] ) .",
    "the results in @xcite lead way to the following conjecture :    for every @xmath3 there exists a @xmath4 such that the time development of an asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric , conformally smooth initial data set which is conformally flat in a neighbourhood @xmath5 of infinity admits a conformal extension to null infinity of class @xmath6 near spacelike infinity , if and only if the initial data set is schwarzschildean to order @xmath7 in @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , if the conformal extension of the data is smooth i.e of class @xmath8 the data are exactly schwarzschildean in @xmath5 .",
    "this conjecture , if found to be true , could be regarded as a rigidity result .",
    "it is the objective of the present article to analyse what happens when the assumption of conformal flatness near infinity is removed from the initial data .",
    "it could well be the case that the rigidity at spatial infinity suggested by the conjecture is an artifact of the `` specialness '' of the conformal flatness at infinity .",
    "it will be shown that this does not seem to be the case . our main result cf . with the main theorem of @xcite",
    "is the following .",
    "a necessary condition for the development of time symmetric initial data to be smooth at the intersection of null infinity and spatial infinity is that the data set is at least static to order 3 .",
    "what we mean by being static up to an order @xmath9 will be clarified in the main text . a more technical statement of the theorem",
    "will be also be given there .",
    "based on our main theorem , and noting that the only time symmetric data which are conformally flat and static near infinity are the schwarzschildean ones , we put forward the following conjecture :    for every @xmath3 there exists a @xmath4 such that the time development of an asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric data set which is conformally smooth in a neighbourhood @xmath5 of infinity admits a conformal extension to null infinity of class @xmath6 near spacelike infinity , if and only if the initial data set is static to order @xmath7 in @xmath5 . moreover ,",
    "if the conformal extension is of class @xmath8 , then the data are exactly static in @xmath5 .",
    "as stated , the conjecture excludes totally the presence of gravitational radiation near spatial infinity .",
    "whether the latter is a severe limitation for the modeling of systems of physical interest remains to be seen . with regard to non - time symmetric data",
    ", one should not expect the things to be any better . in this case",
    "it has been shown that , for example , the presence of linear momentum in the initial data produces solutions of the constraints which contain logarithms see @xcite .",
    "analogous terms are , in the linear case , source of further non - smoothness at the intersection of null and spatial infinity see e.g. @xcite . in any case ,",
    "a good picture of the complications of considering non - time symmetric data is not yet available see however the results given in @xcite .",
    "this article is a natural continuation of the investigations undertaken in @xcite .",
    "it also motivates and complements some recent results given in @xcite .",
    "the article is structured as follows : sections 2 and 3 provide a brief discussion of the so - called regular finite initial value problem near spatial infinity .",
    "this discussion is by no means intended to be comprehensive .",
    "this material is based on reference @xcite , to which the reader is remitted for full details .",
    "the references @xcite may also prove useful .",
    "section 4 considers the construction of initial data satisfying the regularity condition ( [ reg_cond ] ) , while section 5 discusses the asymptotic expansions near null and spatial infinity obtained from such data .",
    "sections 6 and 7 are devoted to providing an interpretation to the results of section 5 by looking at the static solutions and also to expansions of the bondi mass near spatial infinity .",
    "finally , section 8 provides some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we review some ideas on the description of the region of spacetime `` near null and spatial infinity '' .",
    "our discussion follows closely that given in @xcite , and strives to keep its notation and nomenclature as much as possible .",
    "the reader is remitted to this reference for the details of the constructions here considered .",

    "the metric @xmath26 of the initial hypersurface @xmath27 will be taken to be negative definite . for simplicity and definiteness",

    "accordingly , we assume that there is a 3-dimensional , orientable , smooth compact manifold @xmath32 with a point @xmath33 , and a diffeomorphism @xmath34 of @xmath35 onto @xmath27 , and a conformal factor @xmath36 analytic on @xmath37 with the properties @xmath38 it can therefore be checked that under the above conditions @xmath39 so that the point @xmath18 can be rightfully identified with the infinity of the initial hypersurface @xmath27 .",
    "it will be assumed that the conformal factor @xmath36 is obtained as a result of solving the einstein constraint equations . for conceptual reasons we shall distinguish the point at infinity @xmath18 of the initial hypersurface @xmath27 from the point @xmath40 corresponding to spatial infinity in penrose s framework .",

    "as we are going to make use of a spinorial formalism , the blow up of @xmath18 is technically achieved by resorting to the bundle @xmath45 of normalised spin frames over @xmath37 with structure group @xmath46 , and projection @xmath47 onto @xmath37 .",
    "the details of the blow up will not be given here .",

    "all together , these results provide what we believe is fair evidence for the general conjecture for time symmetric data put forward in the introduction .",
    "it is of interest to see how the results of the previous section can be obtain by means of a different kind of arguments .",
    "namely , we will show how one can relate the obstructions obtained in the previous sections to the bondi mass .",
    "it is intuitively clear although its verification requires some calculations , see e.g. @xcite that if one starts with a cauchy problem near spatial infinity as the one described here , in which the initial data is static , the bondi mass should be constant and equal to the adm mass of the spacetime . the converse , namely starting from a regular finite cauchy problem at spatial infinity with the additional requirement that the bondi mass should be constant to deduce the existence of a static killing vector near spatial infinity , is also intuitively plausible but much more complicated , requiring an existence theorem for the cauchy problem in the neighbourhood of the sets @xmath62 which is not yet available .",
    "the standard way of introducing the bondi mass and other quantities defined at null infinity like the newman - penrose constants is to construct an _",
    "ad hoc _ coordinate system and frame well adapted to the geometry of spacetime near the intersection of null infinity with an outgoing light cone",
    ". we will refer to these coordinates and the concomitant adapted frame to as _ the newman - penrose ( np ) gauge_. a detailed discussion on how to construct this gauge can be found in @xcite . in the np gauge and using the np formalism notation the bondi mass is given by @xmath335 where the functions @xmath336 and @xmath337 depending on a retarded time @xmath338 and the angular dependence are the leading terms of the component @xmath339 of the weyl tensor and the spin coefficient @xmath340 the shear .",
    "these quantities are given in the physical space time , and for the class of solutions of the einstein equations under consideration it can be seen that @xmath341 the integral in ( [ bondi_mass ] ) is evaluated over the cut of @xmath67 defined by @xmath342 the relevance of the bondi mass is that under suitable assumptions it can be shown to be non - negative and non - increasing , i.e. @xmath343 .",
    "furthermore , under some extra assumptions it can be shown to tend to the adm mass of the spacetime as one approaches spatial infinity see @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing that all these discussions about the limit of the bondi mass contain _ fide _ assumptions that shall eventually be removed once a complete theory of spatial infinity is achieved .",
    "a major inconvenient of the bondi mass in the form given by formula ( [ bondi_mass ] ) is the gauge in which it is given , which although very convenient for theoretical discussions , hampers its evaluation in direct examples .",
    "the connection between the np gauge and the gauge used in the present article sometimes refered as to the f gauge has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the transformation between gauges involves the determination of a conformal factor @xmath344 , such that @xmath345 is the conformal factor in the np gauge , and a rotation of the frame @xmath346 introduced in section 2 , and which is realized by matrices @xmath347 . under the choice , @xmath348 , of the function @xmath51 appearing in the conformal factor given in equation([st_cf ] )",

    "hence , the coordinate @xmath43 can be used to parametrise the bondi mass .    instead of calculating the bondi mass using the formula ( [ bondi_mass ] ) , we will make use of the fact that @xmath350 and that @xmath351 where @xmath352 see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath353 has spin weight 1 , and thus it follows that in this case the operator @xmath354 has a uniquely defined inverse @xmath355 see e.g. @xcite .",
    "now , from the discussion given in @xcite to calculate the newman - penrose constants in the f gauge , it also follows that @xmath356 now , only terms with @xmath357 survive this integration of equation ( [ m_dot ] ) .",

    "the results presented in this article constitute what we believe is fair evidence to conjecture that the only time reflexion symmetric spacetimes i.e .",
    "those arising as the developments of time symmetric initial data sets with a smooth conformal extension to null infinity are those that are static in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity .",
    "we would like to contrast the situation of the gravitational field with that of the spin 2 zero rest mass field on a minkowski background . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "an analogue of the regularity condition ( [ reg_cond ] ) is a necessary and sufficient condition to obtain logarithm - free solutions to the transport equations , therefore ensuring that the field is smooth at null infinity the analogue of penrose s proposal for linear fields .",
    "it would be interesting to analyse what happens in the case of fields propagating on curved backgrounds .",
    "the physical intuition suggests that staticity near spatial infinity is also a statement about the behaviour of the gravitational field and their sources at very early and late times that is , near @xmath366 .",
    "this is easier to see in the case of initial data which are schwarzschildean near spatial infinity .",
    "the vanishing of the newman - penrose constant implies then in turn the vanishing of the weyl tensor at @xmath366 as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the interpretation of data which are static near spatial infinity is in any case not that clear for the non - conformally flat case .",
    "for as it has been seen , their newman - penrose constants do not vanish . nevertheless , the fact that it is possible to make non - trivial statements about the behaviour of spacetimes at @xmath366 without having to solve the equations is already astonishing .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recent results by chruciel & delay @xcite make possible now to construct initial data sets of the form required by the conjecture presented in this article i.e .",
    "static near @xmath40 .",
