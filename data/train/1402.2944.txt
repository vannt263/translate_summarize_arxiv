    "the frequency down - converter adds the background photons in the output mode .",
    "therefore the above relation  ( [ eq : g2 ] ) is useful for the estimation of the output light pulse .",
    "suppose that the intensity correlation of a 637-nm input light pulse is @xmath64 and the average photon number of the light is @xmath65 . for simplicity , we assume that the spectral width of the input light is much narrower than the acceptable bandwidth @xmath12 0.1 nm of the frequency down - converter .",
    "we also assume that the background photons induced by the pump light follow the poisson statistics , and are independent of the down - converted photons .",
