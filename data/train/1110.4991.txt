    "taylor - type power - series expansions are very common in physics . in quantum scattering theory ,",
    "the most frequently used expansion of this kind is known as the effective - range expansion . in the case of a short - range potential , it represents the cotangent function of the scattering phase shift @xmath0 in the form @xmath1 here the right - hand side is a sum of terms proportional to even powers of the collision momentum @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are energy independent expansion coefficients . originally ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for a historical review ) , this expansion was suggested in nuclear physics for the @xmath4-wave nucleon - nucleon scattering in the form @xmath5 where the first two parameters on the right - hand side , namely , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , were called the scattering length and the effective radius .",
    "the parameters in the higher terms of this expansion ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc . ) were known as the shape parameters .",
    "this name originated from their dependence on the shape of a chosen @xmath10-potential , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 were mainly determined by the strength of the interaction and the range of the force .",
    "+ originally , some rather inconvenient integral formulae ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) for calculating the parameters on the right hand side of eq . ( [ effr_0 ] ) were suggested .",
    "the expansion , however , was mainly used to parametrize the experimental data by choosing appropriate values for the first few coefficients .",
    "it is still frequently used for such purposes not only in nuclear physics but also for parametrizing the low - energy collisions between atoms and molecules ( see , for example , refs .",
    "the expansion is also useful for simplified analytical description of the scattering near the threshold energy .",
    "for example , in one of the recent works of this type the effective - range expansion is used to study the causality constraints on low - energy universality @xcite . + a workable and rather accurate method for calculating the low - energy parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . ,",
    "was developed about fifty years ago @xcite within the variable - phase approach .",
    "recently the same equations were re - derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using the technique of canonical quantization . in this method ,",
    "the low - energy parameters are the asymptotic values ( @xmath11 ) of the corresponding radial functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , etc . , obeying a system of first - order differential equations . at a fixed @xmath15 ,",
    "these functions give the corresponding low - energy parameters for the potential which is cut off at this value of the radius . +",
    "the main drawback of using the differential equations for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , etc .",
    ", is that such a method is inconvenient in the case of potentials supporting bound states . indeed , with the radius increasing from zero to infinity , the potential grows from nothing to its complete shape and its bound states appear one by one at certain values of @xmath15 .",
    "each new bound state initially appears with zero binding energy which corresponds to infinite scattering length .",
    "therefore the function @xmath12 has singularities , which cause serious problems when the system of differential equations is solved numerically .",
    "this difficulty is avoided if instead of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , etc . , we consider the expansion coefficients of the jost function for the potential cut off at @xmath15 .",
    "these coefficients also obey a system of differential equations but do not have any singularities .",
    "the standard low - energy parameters are obtained from them via simple algebra @xcite .",
    "+ the traditional approach has one significant limitation , namely , the effective - range expansion is only applicable near the point @xmath16 , i.e. when the energy is close to the threshold . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the expansion ( [ effr_l ] ) is generalized by writing it as a series of powers of @xmath17 with an arbitrary complex @xmath18 . by doing this ,",
    "it is possible , for example , to explore the complex @xmath2-plane in search for resonances .",
    "when @xmath19 , the generalized effective - range expansion is no longer a low - energy approximation . in other words , instead of making the expansion around the threshold , one can do it around any point in the complex plane .",
    "+ yet another limitation of the original expansion ( [ effr_l ] ) is that it is formulated for a single - channel problem . for multi - channel problems , something similar",
    "was also suggested @xcite . in these papers",
    ", the authors tried to keep as much similarity with the single - channel case as possible .",
    "their adherence to the functions of the type @xmath20 limited the flexibility and clarity of the suggested equations .",
    "+ in the present paper , we use a different approach in generalizing the effective - range expansion to multi - channel problems . instead of considering the channel phase shifts and their cotangents ,",
    "we look at the problem from a more general point of view . as a first step , we analyze the structure of the jost matrix and explicitly factorize the dependencies of its matrix elements on odd powers of the channel momenta .",
    "these factors determine all the branching points of the riemann surface of the energy , while the remaining factors are single - valued holomorphic functions defined on a simple energy plane .",
    "these functions are then expanded in power series of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an arbitrary complex energy . as a result",
    ", we obtain an expression for the jost matrix such that each of its elements is a product of a nonanalytic `` branching '' factor and a power series . in this way",
    ", we are not limited to the threshold points , but expand the jost matrix practically anywhere on the riemann surface .",
    "when the jost matrix is obtained in such a semi - analytic form ( the first several terms of the expansion ) , the @xmath4 matrix and all the observables can be easily calculated .",
    "although it is possible , there is no need in introducing the generalized scattering length and other parameters .",
    "the jost matrix expansion coefficients are more simple , clear , and convenient for this purpose . +",
    "consider a quantum mechanical two - body problem which , after separation of the motion of its center of mass , is reduced to an effective problem of one body whose dynamics is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath23 consisting of the free - motion part @xmath24 , the interaction operator @xmath25 , and the hamiltonian @xmath26 that describes the internal dynamics in the moving body ( for example , the internal states of colliding atoms ) .",
    "each internal state of the body corresponds to a different channel of the scattering process . in general , there are infinite number of the internal states , i.e. the eigenstates of @xmath26 , @xmath27 we assume that only @xmath28 internal states are important . in other words , we approximate the internal hamiltonian by the @xmath28 terms @xmath29 the total hamiltonian taken in the representation of the relative coordinate @xmath30 and sandwiched between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , becomes the @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced mass in the channel @xmath36 . therefore the eigenvalue equation @xmath37 is reduced to a set of coupled differential equations for the channel wave functions @xmath38",

    "+ to avoid unnecessary complicated notation , we assume that the relative motion in each channel has a single value @xmath42 of the angular momentum .",
    "this does not compromise the generality of our consideration .",
    "indeed , we can always treat the states with different values of angular momentum ( or of any other quantum number ) as different channels , but perhaps with the same threshold energies .",
    "+ therefore the angular dependence of the channel wave function can be factorized in the simple way @xmath43 this reduces eq .",
    "( [ coupled_eigen ] ) to the system of coupled equations for the radial parts of the channel wave functions , @xmath44      u_{n}(e,\\vec{r } )      =      \\sum_{n'=1}^nv_{nn'}(r)u_{n'}(e,\\vec{r})\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 and the channel momenta are defined as @xmath46 in what follows , we assume that the interaction potential is non - singular and of short range , i.e. that all its matrix elements are less singular than @xmath47 at the origin and exponentially vanish at infinity . in principle , the class of acceptable potentials can be much wider .",
    "this however would require a complicated analysis of the analytic properties of the multi - channel jost matrix in order to identify the domain of complex energies where the jost matrix can be analytically continued to . with the exponentially decaying potentials , we can rely on such an analysis given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the domain of analyticity of the multi - channel @xmath48-matrix and @xmath4-matrix is rigorously established .",
    "therefore by narrowing the class of the potentials , we sacrifice the generality for the sake of clarity . + the boundary conditions for eqs .",
    "( [ coupled_radial ] ) are derived from the requirement that any physical solution must be regular at the point @xmath49 and have special behaviour when @xmath11 , which is different for bound , resonant , and scattering states . in sect .",
    "[ sect.transformation ] , we consider these conditions in more detail .",
    "a system of @xmath28 linear second - order differential equations of the type ( [ coupled_radial ] ) has @xmath50 linearly independent column - solutions and only half of them are regular at the origin ( see , for example , ref .",

    ", we can take the riccati - hankel functions @xmath56 .",
    "+ despite the fact that equations ( [ decoupled_radial ] ) are decoupled , we can still treat them as a system .",
    "it therefore has @xmath50 linearly independent column - solutions which can be chosen in many different ways .",
    "the most convenient choice is the following set of @xmath50 columns grouped in two square matrices @xmath57 @xmath58 that represent the in - coming and out - going spherical waves in all the channels .",
    "these @xmath50 columns form a basis in the space of solutions . in other words ,",

    "( [ decoupled_radial ] ) is a linear combination of these @xmath50 columns . in particular",
    ", each column of matrix ( [ fundmatr ] ) at large distances becomes such a combination .",
    "the combination coefficients have two subscripts : one to indicate which column of ( [ fundmatr ] ) is expanded and the other is the summation subscript . similarly to eqs .",
    "( [ inwaves ] , [ outwaves ] ) , we can group these coefficients in square matrices ( they depend on the choice of the energy , but do not depend on @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath59 where , by analogy with the single - channel case ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the energy - dependent matrices @xmath60 can be called jost matrices .",
    "it is not difficult to show that they determine the @xmath4-matrix @xmath61^{-1}\\ ] ] and thus give complete description of the underlying physical system .",
    "the spectral points @xmath62 ( bound states and resonances ) are those where the inverse matrix @xmath63^{-1}$ ] does not exist , i.e. the points where @xmath64",
    "at large distances , the fundamental regular matrix @xmath65 is a linear combination ( [ phi_ass ] ) with the @xmath15-independent coefficient matrices @xmath60 .",
    "we can , however , look for @xmath65 in the same form at any point @xmath15 , but with the coefficient matrices depending on @xmath15 , @xmath66 now , instead of one unknown function @xmath65 , we have two unknown functions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which therefore can not be independent of each other . in principle , we can arbitrarily impose any ( reasonable ) additional condition relating them .",
    "the most convenient is to demand that @xmath69 which is standard in the theory of differential equations , and is known as the lagrange condition within the variation parameters method @xcite .",
    "considering eq .",
    "( [ phi_ass ] ) , we see that the lagrange condition is certainly satisfied at large distances .",
    "therefore , by imposing it , we do not change the asymptotic behaviour of the solution .",

( [ coupled_radial ] ) without the right - hand side ) ; secondly , the lagrange condition ( [ lagrange ] ) ; thirdly , introducing the diagonal matrix of the channel momenta @xmath72 and finally using known wronskian of the riccati - hankel functions , @xmath73-       \\left[\\partial_rw^{\\rm ( in)}\\right]w^{\\rm ( out)}=2ik\\ .\\ ] ] the derivation can be found in ref . @xcite . + as a result , we obtain the following system of first - order differential matrix - equations @xmath74\\ , \\\\[3 mm ] \\label{fmeq }      \\partial_r{\\cal f}^{\\rm ( out ) } & = &      \\phantom{+}\\frac{1}{2i}k^{-1}w^{\\rm ( in)}v\\left [        w^{\\rm ( in)}{\\cal f}^{\\rm ( in)}+        w^{\\rm ( out)}{\\cal f}^{\\rm ( out)}\\right]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are equivalent to the initial second - order schrdinger equation ( [ coupled_radial ] )",
    ". since these equations are of the first order , the boundary conditions for them can only be imposed at a single point . a natural way of doing this is to demand that matrix ( [ ansatz ] ) is regular at the origin . then @xmath75 because both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are singular at @xmath78 , but their singularities exactly cancel each other in the combination @xmath79 the choice of the common value for the functions in eq .",
    "( [ fin_equals_fout ] ) determines the overall normalization of the fundamental matrix ( [ ansatz ] ) , because eqs .",
    "( [ fpeq],[fmeq ] ) are linear and homogeneous . in the single - channel case ,",
    "the regular solution is usually normalized in such a way that it coincides with the riccati - bessel function when @xmath53 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ hp_plus_hm ] ) , it is clear that if we demand that our approach gives the traditional single - channel solution when @xmath80 , we should use the following boundary conditions for eqs .",
    "( [ fpeq],[fmeq ] ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the diagonal unit matrix .",
    "+ thanks to the fact that the in - coming and out - going waves in the fundamental matrix ( [ ansatz ] ) are factorized , it is easy to construct the physical solutions with proper asymptotics .",
    "for example , the bound states at large distances can have only the out - going waves .",

    "( [ spectral ] ) , but at complex values of @xmath85 .",
    "this approach therefore offers a unified way of finding both the bound and resonant states as well as the @xmath4-matrix ( [ s_matrix ] ) for the scattering states .",
    "the corresponding physical wave functions are obtained with correct asymptotic behaviour ( analytically factorized riccati - hankel functions ) .",
    "for a fixed ( generally speaking , complex ) value of the energy @xmath40 , each of the @xmath28 channel momenta ( [ chmom ] ) can have two different values @xmath86 depending on the choice of the sign in front of the square root .",

    "+ when we move around a threshold point , we go from one layer to another .",
    "indeed , a point on a circle centered at the threshold @xmath39 , can be parametrized as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the distance from @xmath39 and @xmath91 is the polar angle . the corresponding channel momentum @xmath92 changes its sign after one full circle and comes back to its initial value after two full circles ( @xmath93 ) .",

    "the two - channel problem with two branching points and four interconnected layers is much more involved .",
    "these connections for the three intervals , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.riemann_double ] @xcite .",
    "when @xmath98 , the surface is so complicated that it is not worthwhile even trying to visualize it .",

    "[ sec.factor ] ) .",
    "the remaining matrices depend only on even powers of all the momenta @xmath99 and thus are single - valued functions of variable @xmath40 .",
    "this saves us the trouble of dealing with the complicated multi - layered manifold .",
    "moreover , using the analytically factorized dependence on @xmath99 , we can establish some of the symmetry properties of jost matrices , i.e. we can relate their values at some points belonging to different layers of the riemann surface ( see sec .",

    "+ this works perfectly for real values of the energy @xmath40 .",
    "however , when we consider complex energies ( for example , in search for resonances ) , a technical difficulty arises .",
