    "the problem of superexchange , or the exchange interaction of two separated electron spins , is an old one , dating back _",
    "e.g. _ to the work of anderson  @xcite who obtained a simple expression for describing the interaction of @xmath8 spins in mn cations separated by a filled shell of o @xmath9 electrons . since",
    "then the concept has been applied to the estimation of parameters in a wide variety of systems , such as hopping parameters in transition - metal compounds ,  @xcite high t@xmath10 superconductors ,  @xcite and electron transfer rates in donor - acceptor systems , such as radical pairs in biological molecules  @xcite . following anderson , many works in the literature",
    "have presented slight modifications and extensions of the superexchange expression @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the electronic parameters can not all be measured directly .",
    "some studies ,  @xcite which rely on assumed models in order to fit experimental data on exchange , typically obtained from spin - wave  @xcite or magnetic - susceptibility measurements  @xcite ( for a review of experiments see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are biased by the suitability of the model .",
    "in contrast , some other analyses , which fit photoemission spectra to parameters from cluster models  @xcite , constitute an independent approach to obtaining values for the electronic parameters .",
    "indeed it has been shown , based on cluster model calculations including a full description of configuration interactions , that the late @xmath8 transition - metal oxides should not be characterized as mott - hubbard ( m - h ) insulators , in which the energy gap is determined by the @xmath11 electron correlation @xmath6 on the metallic species . instead , these systems have been reclassified as charge - transfer ( c - t ) insulators  @xcite in which the gap is determined by the energy of charge - transfer @xmath4 between metal and insulator species .",
    "similarly , as a result of comprehensive cluster calculations , the early transition - metal oxides are now considered to be at least intermediate between the two regimes , with some classified as c - t  @xcite .    in this paper we rederive the well - known problem of the superexchange interaction of singly - occupied cations in a three - site cluster model as a proof - of - principle that expressions for limiting forms are generally path - dependent whenever multiple energy scales are present .",
    "this concept is generalizable to the plethora of other problems in physics desribed by multiple energy scales and for which analytical expressions are only available in limiting forms .    obtaining a simple expression for complex quantities often relies on series expansions .",
    "a careful examination of the convergence properties of the expansion is necessary whenever there are multiple scales in the problem .",
    "bender  @xcite has recently revisited the problem of correlated limits of multiple energy scales , in which the same variable is involved in more than one limit , in terms of @xmath12 symmetry , while a recent study studying correlated limits in @xmath12-symmetric systems  @xcite numerically found that the apparent phase depends on the path taken towards the limits .",
    "we show that the two expressions comprising the expression for superexchange , the singlet and triplet energies , possess different convergence properties , and as such , no single variable can reliably describe the limiting behaviour for superexchange .",
    "we also find that the series expansions used to obtain the limiting behaviour for superexchange are non - commuting , and that in a large part of parameter space , the reverse from the usual sequence of expansions yields better agreement with the exact expression . in sec .",

    "the exact solution is expanded in different ways in sec .",

    "we specifically consider the wannier - orbital representation of anderson s model of the mno crystal  @xcite , where in the ground state , unpaired @xmath8 electrons on mn are separated by o with a filled @xmath9 shell .",
    "the system takes the form of a three - centre cluster model , as in fig .",
    "[ superlevels ] . the @xmath3 energy difference , @xmath13 also known as the charge - transfer energy , has been defined as @xmath4 .    to derive an expression for the exchange interaction between singly - occupied mn cation sites , we use a two - band hamiltonian of the anderson - hubbard type , given in second - quantized form by @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes that the hopping with energy @xmath16 is restricted to nearest neighbours",
    ", the @xmath17 term describes the on - site energy of an electron , and @xmath18 is the number of electrons of spin @xmath19 on site @xmath20 .",
    "the presence of two electrons of opposite spin on a @xmath5 orbital ( mn ) comes at an energy cost @xmath6 due to coulomb repulsion ; @xmath21 for @xmath20 corresponding to the central site , o , is taken to be zero .",
    "finally , @xmath22 taken to be equal to @xmath23 , serves to shift the zero of energy .",

    "( [ h1 ] ) may be depicted in tri - diagonal block form : @xmath26 with the nine anti - ferromagnetic basis configurations ( sufficient for finding exchange ) for four electrons on three sites , @xmath27 the unperturbed basis functions of block @xmath28 have an energy of zero because of shift of the energy zero with @xmath29 as discussed above .",
    "we employ the formalism of the effective hamiltonian , derived _ exactly _ , for the calculation of superexchange .",
    "the purpose of defining an effective hamiltonian is to describe the full hamiltonian in terms of a small subset of the basis , which for our purposes , is the @xmath28 block ( see eq .",
    "( [ block ] ) ) as we are interested in the superexchange interaction between singly - occupied cation orbitals separated by o. an exact projection may be obtained from a resolvent approach ( _ e.g. _ ref .",

    "( [ block ] ) and the matrix notation will be omitted hereafter for clarity .",
    "our eigenvalue problem thus becomes @xmath33 for the projection onto singlet and triplet combinations of separated @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the undetermined @xmath34 , appearing on both sides of eqs .  ( [ heff])-([eigheff ] ) , can lead to the exact eigenvalue for _ one _ element @xmath20 at a time in @xmath35 if we solve for the roots of the equation @xmath36 for each corresponding eigenvalue @xmath37 of @xmath38 .",
    "we essentially have two @xmath39 for all of the eigenvalues of the singlet and triplet subspaces respectively .",
    "the difference in the lowest singlet and triplet energies , @xmath40 is defined as the superexchange @xmath0 .",
    "the formalism of the effective hamiltonian is invoked here for two reasons .",
    "the first is to compare the results with the frequent implementation of using one effective hamiltonian to describe all solutions within an energetically - degenerate subspace  @xcite by approximating the unknown energy @xmath34 in eqs .",
    "( [ heff])-([eigheff ] ) by the unperturbed energy , as in rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory . when followed by an expansion for small @xmath16 , this leads to the same result as a @xmath41-matrix expansion with the unperturbed energy .",
    "the limitations of using unperturbed energies in brillouin - wigner perturbation theory to derive effective hamiltonians have been previously noted  @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between resolvent methods , which we have used , and brillouin - wigner perturbation theory , in the derivation of effective hamiltonians has been discussed extensively in _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the second reason for projecting onto the model subspace is technical : the particular splitting beforehand into two symmetry subspaces , singlet and triplet , enabled mathematica  @xcite to find the required roots in closed form .",
    "in this section , the exact , closed - form expressions for @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath0 provided by the effective - hamiltonian formalism will be expanded in various limiting forms .",
    "the expansion of the exact lowest triplet and singlet energy eigenvalues for @xmath44 up to @xmath45 is @xmath46 such that @xmath47 equations  ( [ uggt])-([jut ] ) were derived by substituting for @xmath48 in the exact @xmath0 and expanding about @xmath49 the same result is obtained for @xmath50 for up to @xmath51 ( single - scale limit ) .    on the other hand ,",
