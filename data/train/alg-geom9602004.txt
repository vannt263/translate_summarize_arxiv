    "let @xmath1 be homotopy equivalent to a finite cw complex and let @xmath0 be the fundamental group of @xmath1 .",
    "one would like to derive geometric properties of @xmath1 from a finite presentation @xmath2 of @xmath0 .",
    "although the isomorphism problem is unsolvable for finite presentations , fox calculus can be used to effectively compute invariants of @xmath0 , up to second commutator , from the presentation . in this paper",
    ", we study a natural stratification of the character variety @xmath3 of @xmath0 , associated to alexander invariants , which we will call the _ alexander stratification . _",
    "we relate properties of the stratification to properties of unbranched coverings of @xmath1 and to the existence of irrational pencils on @xmath1 when @xmath1 is a compact khler manifold .",
    "furthermore , we obtain obstructions for a group @xmath0 to be the fundamental group of a compact khler manifold .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give properties of the alexander stratification as an invariant of arbitrary finitely presented groups .",
    "we begin with some notation and basic definitions of fox calculus in section 2.1 . in section 2.2",
    ", we relate the alexander stratification to jumping loci for group cohomology and in section 2.3 we translate the definitions to the language of coherent sheaves .",
    "this allows one to look at fox calculus as a natural way to get from a presentation of a group to a presentation of a canonically associated coherent sheaf , as we show in section 2.4 .",
    "another way to view the fox calculus is geometrically , by looking at the cw complex associated to a finitely generated group .",
    "we show how the first betti number of finite abelian coverings can be computed in terms of the alexander strata in section 2.5 .    in section 3 ,",
    "we relate group theoretic properties to properties of the alexander stratification .    of special interest to us in this paper",
    "are torsion translates of connected algebraic subgroups of @xmath3 , we will call them _ rational planes _ , which sit inside the alexander strata .",
    "in section 4 , we show how these rational planes relate to geometric properties of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in 4.1 we show that the first betti number of finite abelian coverings of @xmath1 depends only on a finite number of rational planes in the alexander strata .",
    "this follows from a theorem of laurent on the location of torsion points on an algebraic subset of an affine torus . when @xmath1 is a compact khler manifold",
    ", we relate the rational planes to the existence of irrational pencils on @xmath1 or on a finite unbranched covering of @xmath1 .",
    "this gives a much weaker , but simpler version of a result proved by beauville @xcite and arapura @xcite which asserts that when @xmath1 is a compact khler manifold the first alexander stratum is a finite union of rational planes associated to the irrational pencils of @xmath1 and of its finite coverings ( see 4.2 ) .",
    "simpson in @xcite shows that if @xmath1 is a compact khler manifold , then the alexander strata for @xmath4 are all finite unions of rational planes .",
    "since the ideals defining the alexander strata of a finitely presented group are computable and rational planes are zero sets of binomial ideals , one can test whether a group could not be the fundamental group of khler manifold in a practical way : by computing ideals defining the alexander strata and showing that their radicals are not binomial ideals . in section 4.3",
    "we use the above line of reasoning to obtain an obstruction for a finitely presented group of a certain form to be khler .",
    "it gives me pleasure to thank grard gonzalez - sprinberg and the institut fourier for their hospitality during june 1995 when i began work on this paper .",
