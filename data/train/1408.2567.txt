    "due to its challenging complexity , the description of low - dimensional correlated electronic systems still represents an open problem in condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite in particular , their quantum correlation effects can exhibit unconventional features . a typical example , is the spin - charge separation @xcite in the strong interaction regime of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model .",
    "@xcite angle - resolved photoemision spectroscopy studies also reveal a complex pattern of spin - charge coupling / decoupling in both the 1d and two - dimensional ( 2d ) cases in the weak and intermediate - to - strong interaction regimes .",
    "@xcite how to account for these , and many more , quantum correlation effects in the simplest possible way has become a driving force for developing theoretical approximations that could complement already existing state - of - the - art methods like exact diagonalization @xcite ( ed ) , quantum ( qmc ) and variational ( vmc ) monte carlo , @xcite coupled cluster , @xcite variational reduced - density - matrix , @xcite density matrix renormalization group , @xcite matrix product and tensor network states , @xcite as well as quantum embedding approaches .",
    "@xcite all these methods have already been applied to hubbard - like 1d and/or 2d models with variable degree of success .",
    "the exact bethe - ansatz solution to the 1d hubbard model is well known .",
    "@xcite because of this , the model has been frequently used as a testing ground for several theoretical frameworks .",
    "however , an intuitive physical picture of the basic units of quantum fluctuations in the considered 1d systems has remained an open issue within several approximations . in recent years , both single reference ( sr ) and multireference ( mr ) symmetry - projected approximations , @xcite routinely used in nuclear structure physics , @xcite have been applied to describe correlated electronic systems .",
    "it has been shown that mr schemes like the resonating hartree - fock @xcite ( reshf ) and the few determinant @xcite ( fed ) ones , provide a reasonable description of the ground state energies of half - filled and doped 1d hubbard lattices but also account for the main physical trends in correlation functions , momentum distributions , spectral functions , and density of states .",
    "@xcite in addition , within these approaches , one is left with a simple physical picture in which the basic units of quantum fluctuations in 1d lattices can be mainly associated with structural defects in the ( intrinsic ) slater determinants resulting from the corresponding optimizations .",
    "@xcite    the situation is more involved in the case of the 2d hubbard model for which no general ( exact ) solution is known .",
    "such a model has received considerable attention since the discovery of high - t@xmath3 superconductors @xcite and has also become the target for theorists applying many - body methodologies . according to anderson s proposal , @xcite 2d hubbard",
    "is considered a potential model for describing the essential physics in the cuprates . with intensive analytic and numerical studies , @xcite some aspects of the phase diagram have been understood .",
    "@xcite however , many basic features remain controversial .",
    "for example , while it is accepted that the onsite interaction strength drives a mott transition to an insulator at half - filling , @xcite it is much more difficult to accurately describe what happens to the antiferromagnetic order when the system is doped .",
    "from the experimental point of view , cold atoms in optical lattices offer potential direct simulations of hubbard - like models .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , such models are valuable tools to study the properties of graphene @xcite and their ( multiorbital ) extensions @xcite have already provided insight into the interplay between electronic correlations and doping in the parent states of high - t@xmath3 iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite futhermore , both the colossal magnetic resistance and large thermopower has attracted considerable attention . @xcite",
    "in addition , a fascinating effort to understand exotic spin liquid phases in the ground and low - lying excited states of some 2d systems is bringing new light into the complexity of the associated many - electron problems and the theoretical tools used in their description .",
    "@xcite we believe that the previous examples illustrate the need to explore new avenues for describing quantum correlation effects in low - dimensional electronic systems , especially those approximations that are potentially not restricted by the dimensionality of the considered lattices .",
    "the 2d hubbard model has already been considered with symmetry projection tools in a previous work @xcite using a variation - after - projection ( vap ) approach .",
    "@xcite for the considered lattices , it has been shown that such an approach accurately describes both ground and low - lying excited states , with well defined quantum numbers , on an equal footing .",
    "the comparison with other state - of - the - art approximations revealed that the method does account for the most relevant correlations including a basic quantum mechanical fingerprint as the low - lying spectrum of the 6 @xmath0 6 lattice , which is out of reach of ed calculations .",
    "symmetry - projected methods also provide a well - controlled ansatz to compute both spectral functions and density of states .",
    "however , despite being more sophisticated than sr methods , @xcite our scheme still essentially relied on the description of a given ground and/or excited state in terms of a single symmetry - projected configuration ( or component ) .",
    "this certainly limits the amount of correlations that can be described in the ground and excited states of nuclear , @xcite condensed mater , @xcite and quantum chemistry systems .",
    "@xcite in this study , we present results that go beyond such a single configuration and benchmark a mr method , i.e. , the fed approach , @xcite further including the breaking and restoration of the full space group symmetry , which was not included in our previous work .",

    "@xcite these intrinsic states @xmath4 are optimized one - at - a - time within the fed approach .",
    "@xcite a simultaneous optimization of all the transformations @xmath9 can become quite demanding in situations where large expansions in terms of nonorthogonal symmetry - projected configurations are required .",
