    "in this paper we continue our investigations , initiated in @xcite , of the precise _ quantitative _ description of the late - time asymptotic behavior of self - gravitating massless fields . in @xcite",
    "we considered the simplest case of a spherically symmetric massless scalar field . using nonlinear perturbation analysis we showed that solutions starting from small initial data decay as @xmath4 at timelike infinity and as @xmath5 at null infinity .",
    "we also derived a simple analytic formula for the amplitude of the late - time tail in terms of initial data .",
    "here we study the analogous problem for wave maps which are a natural geometric generalization of the wave equation for the massless scalar field .",
    "this generalization seems interesting because in the so called equivariant case the homotopy index @xmath0 of the map plays the role similar to the multipole index for spherical harmonics .",
    "however , in contrast to the decomposition of a scalar field into spherical harmonics which makes sense only at the linearized level , it is consistent to study nonlinear evolution for the wave map within a fixed equivariance class . in this sense @xmath0-equivariant",
    "self - gravitating wave maps can serve as a poor man s toy - model of non - spherical collapse .",
    "the @xmath6 case reduces to the spherically symmetric massless scalar field analyzed in @xcite so hereafter we assume that @xmath1 .",
    "we note aside that the @xmath7 case has been extensively studied in the past focusing on the critical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation @xcite , however , to our knowledge , the late - time behavior of wave maps coupled to gravity has not been analyzed before .    using the same third - order perturbation method as in @xcite we show here that for small compactly supported initial data the late - time tail of the self - gravitating @xmath0-equivariant wave map decays as @xmath2 at future timelike infinity and as @xmath3 at future null infinity .",
    "we also compute the amplitude of the tail in terms of initial data .",
    "these analytic results are verified by the numerical integration of the einstein - wave map equations .",
    "let @xmath8 be a map from a spacetime @xmath9 into a riemannian manifold @xmath10 .",

    "the field equations derived from ( [ action ] ) are the einstein equations @xmath18 with the stress - energy tensor @xmath19 and the wave map equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the christoffel symbols of the target metric @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the wave operator associated with the metric @xmath14 . as a target manifold we take the three - sphere with the round metric in polar coordinates @xmath24 @xmath25 for the four dimensional spacetime @xmath26 we assume spherical symmetry and use the following ansatz for the metric @xmath27 in addition",
    "we assume that the map @xmath28 is spherically @xmath0-equivariant , that is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree @xmath0 . for this ansatz , the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tep ] ) does not depend on angles and",

    "for @xmath37 ( no gravity ) equations ( 7)-(9 ) are trivially solved by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while equation ( [ we2 ] ) reduces to the flat space wave map equation .",
    "we assume that initial data are small , smooth , and compactly supported ( the last assumption can be replaced by a suitable fall - off condition ) @xmath40 we make the following perturbative expansion @xmath41 substituting this expansion into the field equations and grouping terms with the same power of @xmath42 we get the iterative scheme which can be solved recursively .",

    "the @xmath113-part comes from the cubic nonlinearity of the wave map equation and is present without gravity as well .",
    "the case @xmath7 is special in the sense that the @xmath113-part is absent in ( [ f3tail ] ) since it is subdominant ( decaying as @xmath118 ) with respect to the leading order term",
    ". 0.2 cm _ remark 2 . _",
    "it is instructive to compare the tail ( [ f3tail_lgen ] ) with the tail for a test linear massless field propagating on a fixed stationary asymptotically flat background . according to the price law @xcite the @xmath0-th multipole of this linear tail @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "this decay is by one power faster than that in ( [ f3tail_lgen ] ) .",
    "of course , this difference is not very surprising as the tail studied here and price s tail correspond to different physical situations , however we point it out as another example of the inapplicability of linearized theory in the study of radiative relaxation processes ( see @xcite for other examples ) .",
    "we shall discuss this issue in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this section we compare the above analytic predictions with the results of numerical solutions of einstein - wave map equations ( [ h - constraint]-[we2 ] ) for various initial data .",
    "the details of the numerical method were given in @xcite for the case @xmath6 .",
    "the only difference for higher @xmath0 is the boundary condition @xmath121 for small @xmath32 which guarantees regularity at the origin .",
    "the initial data were generated by the gaussian @xmath122 for different values of @xmath42 . for these initial data the formula ( 37 ) gives for @xmath7 @xmath123 and the formula ( 45 ) gives for @xmath102 @xmath124 in order to extract the parameters of the tails at timelike infinity we fit our numerical data with the formula @xmath125         the results and their confrontation with analytic predictions are summarized in table  1 and figures  1 , 2 , and 3 . from this comparison",
    "we conclude that the third - order approximation is excellent for sufficiently small initial data . for large data approaching the black - hole threshold",
    "the third - order approximation breaks down  this is seen in fig .  2 as the deviation from the scaling @xmath126 and in fig .  3 as the deviation from the linear dependence of @xmath127 on @xmath128",
    "+ it should be emphasized that we get the same decay rates @xmath2 ( at timelike infinity ) and @xmath3 ( at null infinity ) for _ all _ subcritical evolutions , regardless of whether our third - order formula reproduces accurately the amplitude of the tail ( for small data ) or fails ( for large data ) ."
