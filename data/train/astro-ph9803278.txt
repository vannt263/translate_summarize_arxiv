    "the x - ray binary circinus  x-1 is unique in its complex temporal and spectral variability .",
    "a 16.55  day cycle of flaring is observed in the x - ray ( @xcite ) as well as optical ( @xcite ) , ir ( @xcite ) , and radio bands ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high degree of stability of the period of this cycle is evidence that it is the orbital period .",
    "the onset of flaring has been suggested to be the result of enhanced mass transfer occurring near periastron of a highly eccentric binary orbit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray profile and average intensity of the 16.55  day cycle has varied considerably over timescales of years ( see e.g , dower , bradt , & morgan 1982 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; shirey et  al .",
    "1996 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "observations with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) all - sky monitor ( asm , 212  kev ) showed cir  x-1 in a sustained bright state with a baseline intensity level of @xmath01.0  crab ( 75 c / s ; 1060 @xmath2jy at 5.2 kev ) and strong flaring up to as high as 3.5  crab ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flaring state began during the day following phase zero ( based on the radio ephemeris of @xcite ) and typically lasted 25  days ( see figure  [ fig : asm ] and discussion below ) .",
    "the ratio of count rates in different asm energy channels showed dramatic spectral softening at the onset of the flaring state and gradual hardening during the remainder of each cycle ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar behavior was seen in _",
    "asm observations folded at the 16.55 day period ( @xcite ) . near phase zero , some of the cycles observed with the _ rxte _  asm also showed brief dips below the 1  crab level .",
    "observations of dips near phase zero in cir  x-1 with _ asca _  ( @xcite ) and the _ rxte _  pca ( @xcite ) indicate the presence of both a strongly absorbed spectral component and an unabsorbed component .",
    "observations of type  1 x - ray bursts demonstrate that cir  x-1 is a low magnetic field neutron star ( tennant , fabian , & shafer 1986 ) . additional type  1 bursts have not been observed from cir  x-1 since the _ exosat _  discovery , possibly because the source intensity has been higher during subsequent observations .",
    "the rapid x - ray variability of cir  x-1 at times resembles that of both `` atoll '' and `` z '' low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) as well as black - hole candidates ( @xcite ) .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were reported at 1.4  hz , 520  hz , and 100200  hz in _ exosat _  data ( @xcite , 1988 ) . based on these data , it has been suggested that cir  x-1 is an atoll source that can uniquely reach the eddington accretion rate and exhibit normal / flaring branch qpos at 520  hz ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations made during non - flaring phases with the _ rxte _  proportional counter array ( pca ) showed a qpo peak that varied from 1.3 to 12  hz , flat - topped low - frequency noise ( lfn ) , and a broad peak that varied from 20100  hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two qpo frequencies and the cut - off frequency of the flat - topped noise were highly correlated .",
    "these qpos are likely to be essentially the same phenomenon as those previously seen in the _ exosat",
    "_  observations at 520  hz and 100200  hz .    in this paper we present additional _ rxte _  asm observations of cir  x-1 which further illustrate how its intensity profile varies from one 16.55  d cycle to another .",
    "we also present the results of _ rxte _  pca observations made over the course of one cycle in which the intensity declined unusually gradually from the flaring state to the quiescent level .",
    "this slow transition allows us to demonstrate how the time - variability properties of the source are related to its spectral properties .",
    "the _ rxte _  asm has now provided 212  kev light curves for over 45 orbital cycles of cir  x-1 since 1996 february . throughout all these cycles , the baseline intensity has remained near 1.0  crab .",
    "the variety of intensity profiles is illustrated in figure  [ fig : asm ] , which shows asm light curves and hardness ratios for three cycles . in many cycles , after 35  days in the flaring state the intensity is quite steady for the remainder of the cycle ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : asm]a ) .",
    "in addition to the main flaring episode , some cycles show a mid - phase flare ( not always at the same phase ) to as high as 2  crab ( figure  [ fig : asm]b ) .",
    "occasionally , the flaring state begins after phase zero and continues for most of the cycle with a gradually decreasing intensity ( figure  [ fig : asm]c ) .",
    "all cycles observed with the asm show the general pattern of spectral hardening mentioned above . during the half day before phase zero , and continuing intermittently for up to two days , brief dips occur in many cycles ( perhaps in all cycles , since the asm coverage is incomplete ) .",
    "these dips are seen as isolated low points in the asm light curves of figure  [ fig : asm ] .",
    "eight pca observations ( @xmath06  ksec each ) were carried out during 1997 february  18  march  4 to sample one 16.55  day cycle at roughly two - day intervals ( figure  [ fig : asm]c and table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the very gradual decline of the flaring - state intensity in this cycle serendipitously provided an opportunity to study intensity - related source properties .",
    "all five proportional counter units ( pcus ) of the pca operated normally during each observation , except during the first few minutes of the first observation when only three pcus were on .",
    "all intensities for that period have been adjusted by a factor of 5/3 , but these data are not used in color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams due to gain differences between detectors .    figure  [ fig : pcalc ] shows the light curves and hardness ratios ( with 16  s time resolution ) for each of the pca observations ( i  viii in time order ) , made as the intensity declined from 2.5  crab to 1.0  crab . on time - scales of hundreds of seconds ,",
    "the observations made at high intensities show strong variability , while observations at 1.0  crab show quite steady count rates . as expected from the asm hardness ratios , the pca hardness ratio gradually increases from a low value during the early observations when the source was in the flaring state to a factor four higher as it reached the quiescent level .",
    "the relationship between intensity and spectral changes is discussed in detail below .",
    "for the eight pca observations of 1997 february  march , 16  s intensity and hardness - ratio measurements were used to construct color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams ( cds / hids , figure  [ fig : cchid_all ] ) .",
    "the hardness ratios were defined as the ratio of count rates in selected energy bands : a soft color ( i[4.86.3  kev ]  / i[2.04.8  kev ] ) and hard color ( i[1318  kev ]  / i[8.513  kev ] ) for the cd , and a broad color ( i[6.313  kev ]  / i[2.06.3  kev ] ) for the hid .",
    "the evolution from flaring to quiescent state produced a large range of colors and intensities over the entire cycle .",
    "in contrast , each individual observation yielded a localized cluster or track within the cds and hids .",
    "the spectral branches for each of the observations are easier to distinguish in the hid than the cd .",
    "the long tracks in the hid associated with observations  i  v show the color changes associated with the large intensity variations during the flaring phases .",
    "the intensity variations are smaller for observations vi  viii , but significant color changes do occur during these observations as well",
    ".    the choice of energy bands used in constructing these diagrams can affect the appearance of spectral tracks .",
    "for observations showing a single branch , only the length and slope of the branch is affected .",
    "observations v and vi each show two branches .",
    "the orientation of these branches is discussed in more detail below .",
    "the tracks in the cd and hid are reminiscent of the correlated spectral / intensity behavior of z and atoll class lmxbs , which also show correlations of temporal properties with position along tracks or branches in cds and hids ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have investigated how the temporal properties of cir  x-1 are related to position in the cd or hid . for this purpose",
    ", we divided the hid track for each of the eight observations into three regions ( figure  [ fig : cchid_all]b ) .",
    "the choice of numbers for each region was motivated in part by the timing results discussed below , but the numbers serve mainly as reference labels rather than as meaningful quantities ( such as z `` rank number '' ) .",
    "fourier power density spectra ( pdss ) were computed using 16 s segments with 244  @xmath2s ( @xmath3  s ) time bins .",
    "this was done for both the full 232  kev energy range and for four energy channels : 2.04.8  kev , 4.813  kev , 1318  kev , and 1832  kev .",
    "the leahy - normalized power spectra ( @xcite ) were converted to the fractional rms normalization by dividing by the background - subtracted count rate in the selected band . the expected poisson level , i.e. the level of white noise due to counting statistics , was estimated taking into account the effects of deadtime ( morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ; zhang et  al .  1995 , 1996 ) and subtracted from each pds ; this method tends to slightly underestimate the actual poisson level . for each of the 24",
    "hid regions defined in figure  [ fig : cchid_all ] , an average pds was calculated from the power spectra corresponding to points in that region .",
    "the pdss were then logarithmically rebinned .",
    "the average pds ( 232 kev ) for each hid region is shown in figure  [ fig : pds ] . during the extended active state ( observations",
    "i - vi ) , a broad peak is often observed near 4  hz ; this feature is prominent in pdss from observations iii  vi , weak in observation  ii , and indistinguishable from a flat - topped component in observation  i ( see below ) .",
    "a strong narrow qpo feature is seen at frequencies from 6.8 to 13  hz in observations vii and viii . in some cases , especially at higher photon energy ( see figure  [ fig : pds3e ] ) , a harmonic peak is observed at twice the frequency of this qpo .",
    "a weak narrow qpo feature is present at frequencies above 20 hz in regions ii-1 and vi-1 .",
    "a sharp `` knee '' is present at similar frequencies in regions ii-2 , ii-3 , iii-1 , iv-1 , vi-2 , vi-3 , and possibly i-1 .",
    "broad high - frequency noise is sometimes seen , e.g.  at @xmath0100  hz in observation viii ( figure  [ fig : pds3e]b ) .",
    "there is an underlying red continuum spectrum of noise in all of the regions of the hid , but the shape and low frequency slope of the continuum vary over a wide range .    the narrow qpo peaks and the low frequency noise in the pdss from the `` quiescent '' 1  crab observations ( vii and viii ) resemble previously observed pdss ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . those pdss also contained narrow qpo features , with centroid frequencies in the range 1.320  hz , and similarly shaped low - frequency noise .",
    "the broad high - frequency component that we detect in the present observations is similar to the 20100  hz qpo seen in earlier pca observations ( @xcite ) and to the 100200  hz qpo observed with _ exosat _  ( @xcite ) .    the weak narrow qpo feature above 2030  hz in regions ii-1 and vi-1 occurs near the knee of the low - frequency noise component .",
    "this similarity to the lfn and prominent qpo at lower frequency in observations vii and viii suggests these higher frequency oscillations are produced by the same physical process as the lower frequency qpos . in observations",
    "ii and vi , this qpo feature is visible in region 1 as a small peak that fades in region 2 and becomes only a `` knee '' in region 3 ( see figure  [ fig : pds ] ) .",
    "thus we assume that this knee is related to the qpo .",
    "similar knees are present in regions iii-1 , iv-1 , and possibly i-1 .",
    "we include a narrow qpo component in fits of pdss which show a knee above 20  hz , but identify these cases as `` unpeaked '' in the discussion below .    likewise ,",
    "although no peak appears in the pdss from observation i , a broad noise component has roughly constant power below about 4  hz and drops off above that frequency , forming a `` knee '' which might indicate the presence of the 4  hz qpo component .",
    "the pds for region i-1 somewhat resembles those of regions iii-1 and iv-1 , in that all show a break in the power spectrum near 4  hz and a second knee or change in slope near 30  hz .",
    "we include a broad qpo component in fits of the pdss for observation i , but we identify these cases as `` unpeaked '' .",
    "the pdss were fit with models comprising both broad - band and qpo components : a power - law for the very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) , an exponentially cut - off power - law for the broad low - frequency noise , a lorentzian for the broad qpo near 4  hz , lorentzians for the narrow qpo and its first harmonic , a broad lorentzian for the high - frequency peak , and a second power - law to fit the residual poisson noise at high frequency . the model for each pds",
    "consisted of two to five of these components , depending on which components were necessary for an acceptable fit .",
    "the frequency of the harmonic ( when present ) of the narrow qpo was fixed at twice the fundamental frequency .",
    "for the fits of the pdss from the four narrower energy channels , the qpo centroid frequencies were fixed at the values determined from the 232  kev pdss .",
    "there were generally not enough counts to obtain useful pds fits for the 1832  kev channel . for use in performing the fits , we estimated the variance of each power in each binned and averaged pds by calculating the sample variance of the powers in the individual pdss that were averaged to obtain each point , and dividing the result by the number of the powers used in computing the sample variance .",
    "the centroids of the narrow variable - frequency qpo and the @xmath04  hz qpo were measured accurately whenever a clear peak was visible . however , in cases where these components are weak or unpeaked , the centroids were less well - constrained .",
    "the centroid of the broad high - frequency peak and the cut - off frequency of the lfn were often poorly constrained .",
    "figure  [ fig : freq_vs_i ] shows the frequency of the broad and narrow qpos versus intensity ( 218  kev ) .",
    "the frequency of the narrow peak is generally correlated with intensity , starting at 6.8  hz at 1  crab and reaching 32  hz at 1.3  crab . at higher intensity , this qpo is sometimes present above 20  hz and is often unpeaked ( i.e. , a knee ) . in observations iii  vi , the broad qpo is clearly present at 3.3 to 4.3  hz .",
    "this qpo component was included in the fits of the pdss from observations  i and ii , and the resulting frequencies ( 2.14.5  hz ) are shown as unfilled squares ( indicating a weak peak or a knee ) above 20  kcts / s in figure  [ fig : freq_vs_i ] .",
    "the ratio of the width of the narrow qpo peak to its centroid frequency ( @xmath4 ) is about 0.15 when at 6.8 to 13  hz . at higher frequency",
    "this qpo becomes broader , with @xmath5 .",
    "when the broad qpo near 4  hz is strong , we find that @xmath6 , and when it is weak @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rms_vs_e ] illustrates the dependence of the rms amplitude of the qpos upon photon energy .",
    "typical values for the rms amplitude of the 6.813.1  hz qpo at 24.8  kev , 4.813  kev , and 1318  kev are 4% , 5% , and 8% respectively ( figure  [ fig : rms_vs_e]a ) , indicating a weak trend of increasing rms amplitude at higher photon energy .",
    "the amplitude of the broad qpo increases significantly at higher photon energy . for clearly peaked 4  hz qpos , the rms amplitude is typically about 3% , 8% , and 18% in these three energy bands ( figure  [ fig : rms_vs_e]b ) .",
    "the rms values vary considerably when these components are weak or unpeaked but their amplitudes still generally increase with energy ( figure  [ fig : rms_vs_e]c ) .",
    "the outlines of the hid regions of figure  [ fig : cchid_all]b are reproduced in figure  [ fig : hidqpo ] with labels summarizing the observed qpo properties . as the hardness ratio decreases and the intensity increases along the hid tracks for observations viii , vii , and vi , the frequency of the narrow qpo feature increases from 6.8  hz to 32  hz .",
    "the feature is rather weak and knee - like in observation vi , but it appears to have a width consistent with the width of the prominent qpo peak in observations vii and viii .",
    "a similar weak and somewhat knee - like feature is also present in observation ii , where it increases in frequency from 22  hz to 30  hz as the intensity increases .",
    "the pdss from observations i , iii , and iv all show a knee above 30  hz at the high - intensity , hard end of their hid tracks ; these knees may be related to the narrow qpo features seen in the other observations .",
    "the broad 4  hz qpo is not present in the `` quiescent '' observations ( vii and viii ) .",
    "this qpo is strongest in portions of the intermediate - intensity observations ( iii  vi ) and is weakly present in the soft , high - intensity observations ( ii and possibly i ) .",
    "very low frequency noise dominates the power spectrum of regions v-3 and iii-3 .",
    "both of these regions appear to begin upturned branches at the low - intensity , soft end of branches showing the more pronounced 4  hz qpos .",
    "the combined temporal and spectral - branch properties of the observations presented here suggest z - like behavior .",
    "we identify the 6.832  hz qpos as horizontal - branch oscillations ( hbos ) , the 4  hz qpo as normal - branch oscillations ( nbos ) , and the strong vlfn as flaring - branch behavior ( see discussion below ) .",
    "these identifications of characteristic time - variability patterns then help to identify the tracks in the hid as horizontal , normal , and flaring branches ( hb / nb / fb ) , where each 6 ks observation of cir  x-1 appears to have captured a snapshot of portions of one or two of the branches .",
    "the spectral branches appear to shift around as the flaring gradually subsides , rather than forming a stable z pattern .",
    "it is likely that the shapes of the spectral branches become distorted somewhat during these large shifts .",
    "we now describe the inferred properties of each of the spectral branches in more detail .      hid regions viii , vii , and vi-1 show a narrow qpo peak or knee at 6.87.6  hz , 11.313.1  hz , and 32  hz respectively .",
    "this frequency range overlaps the 1360  hz range of typical horizontal branch qpos ( @xcite ) .",
    "the associated low - frequency noise and harmonic peak are also typical of horizontal branch power spectra .",
    "the broad high frequency peak in cir  x-1 may be related to the high frequency noise component often observed on the horizontal branch .",
    "the hid track for observation vi shows the narrow qpo at 32  hz on a roughly horizontal segment ( region vi-1 ) and a knee at 37  hz on the right end of this segment ( region vi-2 ) .",
    "the apex of region vi-2 brings a transition to the 4  hz qpo , which is dominant on the downward branch of this track ( region vi-3 ) .",
    "this is very similar to the hb / nb transition in z sources .",
    "when cir  x-1 is in `` quiescence '' in observations vii and viii , the `` horizontal branch '' turns upward and becomes vertical in the hid . for comparison ,",
    "_ rxte _  pca observations of cir  x-1 from 1996 march 1019 which show a narrow qpo peak at 1.312  hz ( @xcite ) are almost entirely confined to the 12.314.7 kcts / s ( 221 kev ) intensity range",
    ". the hid tracks for those observations lie along a nearly vertical line , and probably represent sections of the `` horizontal '' branch .",
    "observation ii may also be on part of the hb , since a weak narrow qpo appears to evolve into a knee and increase in frequency from 22 to 30  hz as the intensity increases .",
    "however , the broad qpo is also weakly visible in pdss for this observation .",
    "the fact that observations ii , vi , vii , and viii all show little variation of the hard color used in figure  [ fig : cchid_all]a suggests that observation  ii may be associated with the other hb observations .",
    "the 4  hz qpo is observed when the source intensity rises above the `` quiescent '' 1-crab level ( @xmath013  kcts / s ) .",
    "it is roughly stationary in frequency ( 3.34.3  hz when clearly peaked ) and broader than the hbo .",
    "the feature is easily seen in observations iii  vi ; at these times the location in the hid moves along diagonal tracks .",
    "the @xmath04  hz frequency and motion along diagonal tracks in the hid is consistent with the 47  hz nbos observed at nearly constant frequency on the nb of typical z sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore identify the broad 4  hz qpo as a normal branch oscillation , and the diagonal tracks for observations iii  vi as shifted normal branches .",
    "the broad qpo component may be also present in the highest intensity observations , as a weak feature in observation ii and in the form of a break near the 4  hz qpo frequency in observation  i. we also note that at the top of the normal branch ( regions i-1 , iii-1 , iv-1 , vi-2 ) a knee above 30  hz is present in addition to the nbo component .",
    "a similar broad 4  hz qpo is present in observations from 1996 march 56 made immediately before phase zero of the cycle showing the 1.312  hz narrow qpo .      beyond the left apex of the normal branch a short upturned branch",
    "is observed in hid region  v-3 and possibly iii-3 .",
    "the pds for these regions are dominated by very low frequency noise , which is typical for flaring branches , and no qpo peaks are obviously apparent .",
    "we note that in the well - established z sources neither nbos nor hbos are present on the flaring branch , except for sco  x-1 and gx  17 + 2 , in which the nbo evolves into a 620  hz qpo ( @xcite and references therein ) .    the left end of the spectral track for observation  v bends upward in the hid shown in figure  [ fig : cchid_all]b , but bends downward in the cd in figure  [ fig : cchid_all]a .",
    "this behavior is demonstrated more clearly in figure  [ fig : cchid_56medhard ] , which shows cds and hids for observations v and vi . when a broad color ( i[6.313  kev ]  / i[2.06.3  kev ] ) is used as the ordinate of the diagrams ( figure  [ fig : cchid_56medhard]a , b ) , the track for observation  v turns upward on the left end . when a harder color ( i[1318  kev ]  / i[8.513  kev ] ) is used as the ordinate ( figure  [ fig : cchid_56medhard]c , d ) , this branch turns downward .",
    "the cd and particularly the hid version based on the harder color show the most clear similarity to canonical z diagrams , with the temporal behavior of observations v and vi being generally consistent with horizontal , normal , and flaring branches .",
    "the broad - color hid ( figure  [ fig : cchid_56medhard]b ) shows evidence for a shift of the normal branch that does not show up in the other three diagrams of that figure .",
    "our observations reveal spectral branches which shift in the cd and hid as cir  x-1 evolves from a soft , high - intensity state to a hard , lower - intensity state .",
    "the asm light curves and hardness ratios ( figure  [ fig : asm ] ) show that this evolution occurs periodically with the 16.55  day cycle , thus suggesting that the cd / hid shifts may also be periodic .",
    "shifts of the `` z '' pattern in cds and hids have been observed in the so - called cyg - like z sources : cyg  x-2 ( kuulkers , van  der  klis , & vaughan 1996 ) , gx  5 - 1 ( @xcite ) , and gx  340 + 0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the shifts do not occur periodically in those sources , nor do they have the magnitude of the shifts observed in cir  x-1 .",
    "the flaring branch of cir x-1 turns upward when a soft or broad color is used on the vertical axis .",
    "when a harder color is used , this branch turns downward but then bends to the left . in the cyg - like z sources ,",
    "the flaring branch sometimes turns upward or starts toward higher intensity and then loops back to lower intensity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in some cases ,",
    "these sources are observed to `` dip '' while on the flaring branch ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with tracks which turn down and then to the left , similar to that of cir  x-1 in figure  [ fig : cchid_56medhard]c .",
    "the left end of the horizontal branch in cir  x-1 turns upward and becomes vertical at low intensity ( figure  [ fig : hidqpo ] ) . on this section of the branch ,",
    "hbo frequencies are low : 6.813  hz in observations vii and viii and 1.312  hz in the earlier 1996 march observations .",
    "a similar effect was reported in gx 5 - 1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which the hb turns upward at the low - intensity end while hbos are observed at relatively low frequency ( 1317  hz ) .",
    "in fact , lewin et  al.(1992 ) suggested that other z sources might show such an upward turn of the hb if their intensities and qpo frequencies became sufficiently low .",
    "the 520  hz narrow qpo was detected with _",
    "exosat _  at an intensity similar to the quiescent level observed by _",
    "rxte_. we note that absorption dips are responsible for much of the structure seen in the cd shown for that observation ; however , the hids show that the narrow qpo occurred on an upturned left end of a horizontally oriented track as in our data ( see figures  24 , 8 , & 10 in @xcite ) . at higher intensity during the same observation ,",
    "the narrow qpo was not present , and we note that some of the high - intensity pdss show hints of a broad peak near 4  hz . we thus conclude that the behavior observed by _ exosat _  during that observation is related to the z - like behavior we observe with _",
    "most of the other _ exosat _",
    "observations took place when cir  x-1 was significantly lower in intensity than the `` quiescent '' level of the current observations . the cds and hids for these _ exosat _",
    "observations did not show tracks which could clearly be identified as z or atoll .",
    "their power spectra were generally dominated by vlfn , typical of atoll sources in the banana state , and sometimes also showed a broad red noise component resembling atoll high - frequency noise ( @xcite ) . however , these power - spectral shapes are not unique to atoll sources : power spectra for black hole candidates in the high state are dominated by vlfn , as are those of the current observations on the low - intensity end of the normal branch and on the flaring branch ( i.e. , regions iii-3 and v-3 ) .",
    "cir  x-1 was expected to never show hbos since atoll - like behavior was taken as evidence that the magnetic field is not strong enough to allow the magnetospheric beat frequency mechanism ( mbfm ) to operate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( however , it is also possible that the hbos are not produced by the mbfm . )",
    "the results presented here demonstrate both hbos and nbos in cir  x-1 and show no evidence for atoll behavior . since the atoll - like behavior observed with _",
    "exosat _  occurred at lower intensity than in the present observations , it is possible that they do represent a different state of the source .",
    "if cir  x-1 actually can show atoll behavior as well as the z - like behavior shown here , then we would have new clues to the differences between the two types of sources .",
    "such observations would challenge the hypothesis that differences in both @xmath1 and magnetic field distinguish these two classes .",
    "our results from an analysis of _ rxte _  observations of cir  x-1 reveal behavior similar to that of z sources , and , in particular , allow us to identify temporal and spectral signatures of the horizontal , normal , and flaring branches . the spectral variability of cir  x-1 is seen to correspond to tracks in a hid which are similar in direction to the typical direction in the hid of z sources in general , but the locations of the tracks corresponding to each branch move from observation to observation in a systematic manner",
    ".    to be specific , in the current observations of cir  x-1 the horizontal branch is characterized by the presence of relatively narrow 6.832  hz qpo features in the pds .",
    "the track in the hid of the horizontal branch is horizontal at the high intensity end and becomes vertical at the low intensity end , where the source is `` quiescent '' , i.e. , has an intensity near 1  crab and is characterized by a relatively low degree of variability on time scales longer than 1  s. the normal branch is characterized by broad 4  hz qpos , and by motion in the hid which generally falls along tracks which run diagonally from hard high - intensity locations to soft low - intensity locations .",

    "<S> we present _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _  ( _ rxte _ ) all - sky monitor observations of the x - ray binary circinus  x-1 which illustrate the variety of intensity profiles associated with the 16.55  d flaring cycle of the source . </S>",
    "<S> we also present eight observations of cir  x-1 made with the _ rxte _  proportional counter array over the course of a cycle wherein the average intensity of the flaring state decreased gradually over @xmath012 days . </S>",
    "<S> fourier power density spectra for these observations show a narrow quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) peak which shifts in frequency between 6.8  hz and 32  hz , as well as a broad qpo peak that remains roughly stationary at @xmath04  hz . </S>",
    "<S> we identify these as z - source horizontal and normal branch oscillations ( hbos / nbos ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams ( cds / hids ) show curvilinear tracks for each of the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the qpos and very low frequency noise allow us to identify segments of these tracks with z - source horizontal , normal , and flaring branches which shift location in the cds and hids over the course of the 16.55  d cycle . </S>",
    "<S> these results contradict a previous prediction , based on the hypothesis that cir  x-1 is a high-@xmath1 atoll source , that hbos should never occur in this source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . </S>"
