    "unitarity based methods combined with the helicity formalism have proven exceptionally successful in gauge theory calculations at one loop ( see _ e.g. _",
    "such methods have so far been less frequently applied to general relativity  @xcite , and quantum corrections to gravitational systems with massive matter have not been studied in this framework at all . however , such techniques are well - suited for effective field theory considerations in low energy quantum gravity .",
    "early treatments of gravitational loops tended to focus on the ultraviolet divergences , but effective field theory methods have allowed us to separate these ultraviolet divergences from the universal reliable predictions of the low energy portion of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity methods deal directly with on - shell and low energy amplitudes , and products of on - shell tree amplitudes can therefore yield the low energy one - loop results in a conceptually simple manner .    in this paper",
    ", we apply new on - shell amplitude methods to the gravitational scattering of massive matter  @xcite , our focus here is especially on the quantum corrections to the potential ( the ref .",
    "@xcite which appeared near the end of our work , also uses on - shell methods to derive corrections to the scattering potential , but there only the classical correction terms are considered ) .",
    "the unitarity cut for the leading quantum corrections involves the gravitational compton amplitude , _",
    "i.e. _ the two on - shell gravitons coupled to matter . for matter fields of all spins ,",
    "this amplitude has a simple structure , as it is related to the square of the electromagnetic compton amplitude ( involving photons )  @xcite .",
    "a useful observation for our calculation is that computing the massless two - particle cut gives us exactly everything we need .",
    "the cut of the amplitude is precisely one - to - one with the non - analytic parts of the amplitude that contributes to the long - distance leading corrections to the scattering potential at one - loop .",
    "hence , we do not need to reconstruct the full amplitude - we only need to consider the terms contributing to the massless two - particle cut .",
    "moreover , there is an added bonus in using the cut and decomposing the amplitudes using klt ; in such a setup one can easily dissect the interaction between the two particles into a series of spin corrections ; _ i.e. _ a coefficient for the spinless interaction and coefficients of spin - spin interactions , _ etc . _",
    "it has been seen before in direct calculations  @xcite that the coefficients themselves are actually independent of the type of interacting matter ; that is , they are the same for massive scalars , fermions or vector bosons .",
    "we call this property _ matter universality _ or _ matter independence_. this observation appears however to be somewhat puzzling in the context of feynman diagrams , because here the vertex rules ( and even the diagrams that need to be calculated ) differ greatly for different types of matter particles . in this paper",
    "our focus will be on the spinless interaction part of the series of spin corrections .",
    "we will demonstrate directly using the on - shell cut method and klt that this coupling is always identical for any type of particle interaction ; i.e. in the non - relativistic limit it only depends on the masses of the interacting particles .    the classical and quantum corrections to the newtonian potential can be addressed by studying the scattering matrix element in the non - relativistic limit @xmath0 where @xmath1 with @xmath2 is the incoming momentum of the individual particles and @xmath3 is the momentum transfer . in momentum space ( in the non - relativistic and free particle limit ) we employ the following definition of the scattering potential @xmath4 from the amplitude @xmath5 which provides a useful gauge invariant amplitude with which to display the quantum corrections  @xcite .",
    "one could , for example , have subtracted off the second order born contribution , which would lead to a nonrelativistic potential of the type used in bound state quantum mechanics .",
    "we will not do this in this work .",
    "the one - loop diagrams produce modifications to the tree interaction leading to a potential of the form @xmath6\\,.\\ ] ] if this object is fourier transformed to form a spatial potential , the term with the square - root yields the classical @xmath7 general relativistic correction to the potential , and the term with the logarithm produces a long - distance @xmath8 quantum correction .",
    "the analytic correction without a logarithm will yield a short range @xmath9 effect in the potential .",
    "the non - analytic terms ( the square - root and the logarithm ) arise from long - distance propagation of the massless gravitons , and hence are genuinely low - energy quantum predictions .",
    "these can be calculated in the effective field theory approach .",
    "the analytic correction @xmath10 , however is not a prediction of the low - energy theory as it is sensitive to the coefficients of higher curvature terms in the gravitational action .",
    "our work in the present paper will focus on the square - root and logarithmic non - analytic terms of the scattering potential .",

    "in this section we will show how one can represent the gravitational compton scattering of two gravitons off a massive target of spin  @xmath11 as the square of the qed ( abelian ) compton scattering .",
    "we will do this first using covariant amplitudes , and then more compactly using the helicity formalism .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that one can use the known expressions for the massive tree - level amplitudes in yang - mills and qed to obtain in a condensed way the massive tree - level amplitudes in gravity .",
    "as well , the connection between the gravity and the qed amplitude will be instrumental in deriving the matter - independence results in section  [ sec : matter - independence ] .",
    "we will evaluate the one - loop amplitude by considering the unitarity cut across the graviton lines in section  [ sec : grav - compt - scatt ] and  [ sec : oneloophel ] , thus we need to construct the tree - level amplitudes for the emission of two gravitons .",

    "<S> we compute the leading post - newtonian and quantum corrections to the coulomb and newtonian potentials using the full modern arsenal of on - shell techniques ; we employ spinor - helicity variables everywhere , use the kawai - lewellen - tye ( klt ) relations to derive gravity amplitudes from gauge theory and use unitarity methods to extract the terms needed at one - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our results are _ universal _ and thus will hold in any quantum theory of gravity with the same low - energy degrees of freedom as we are considering . </S>",
    "<S> previous results for the corrections to the same potentials , derived historically using feynman graphs , are verified explicitly , but our approach presents a huge simplification , since starting points for the computations are compact and tedious index contractions and various complicated integral reductions are eliminated from the onset , streamlining the derivations . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the spin dependence of the results using the klt factorization , and show how the spinless corrections in the framework are easily seen to be independent of the interacting matter considered . </S>"
