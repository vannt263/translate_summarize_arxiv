    "the field of circumstellar silicate research started in the 1960s when @xcite first theoretically investigated the condensation of dust grains in the circumstellar envelopes around m type long period variables and argued that _ silica _",
    "( sio@xmath2 ) should be the most abundant condensed species .",
    "@xcite showed several years later that grains around oxygen - rich cool giants are mainly _ silicates _ such as al@xmath2sio@xmath3 and mg@xmath2sio@xmath4 .",
    "the presence of silicate dust in evolved stars was first revealed through the detection of the 9.7@xmath0 si  o stretching emission band in m stars @xcite .",
    "this was later further supported by the detection of the 18@xmath0 o  si  o bending emission band , also in m stars @xcite .",
    "the 9.7 and 18@xmath0 silicate bands have also been seen in _ absorption _ in evolved stars with an extended , heavily obscured circumstellar dust shell ( see and references therein ) .",
    "all the earlier observations showed that the 9.7 and 18@xmath0 circumstellar silicate bands were broad , smooth and featureless , suggesting that they were predominantly amorphous @xcite .",
    "indeed , they can be well fitted with laboratory data for amorphous olivine silicates ( e.g. see ) .",
    "this picture has dramatically changed in the 1990s , thanks to the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) and the _ spitzer space telescope_. using the _ short wavelength spectrometer _ ( sws ) on board _ iso _ , obtained the 1245@xmath0 emission spectra of six oxygen - rich evolved stars .",
    "they for the first time reported the detection of crystalline silicates in evolved stars , as revealed by the narrow emission features characteristic of crystalline silicate minerals at wavelengths between 30 and 45@xmath0 .",
    "crystalline silicates have now been observed in all evolutionary stages of evolved stars : red giants and supergiants , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , post - agb stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) and luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars , a mass up to @xmath5150@xmath6 , and a lifetime of only a few million years .",
    "lbvs are a stage in the evolution of very massive stars .",
    "they may evolve to wolf - rayet stars before exploding into supernovae . ] .",
    "extragalactic crystalline silicates have also been found in evolved stars by _ spitzer _ in the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. @xcite ) and in r71 , a lbv star by _",
    "we note that like amorphous silicates , crystalline silicates are usually found in _ oxygen - rich _",
    "environments @xcite.1 ) , all oxygen atoms will be bound in co and therefore no silicates or oxides will be able to form ; instead , one expects to form carbonaceous dust and sic dust @xcite .",
    "] however , the presence of crystalline silicates in _ carbon - rich _ evolved stars has also been reported . in these cases the crystalline silicate grains",
    "were likely produced in previous oxygen - rich mass - loss episodes .",
    "the identification of circumstellar crystalline silicates has been made based on the characteristic mid - ir bands of crystalline silicates .",
    "the _ iso _",
    "sws and lws ( _ long wavelength spectrometer _ ) spectra of evolved stars in the 2.4 to 195@xmath0 wavelength region allow one to identify at least 49 narrow bands which are attributed to crystalline silicates , with distinct emission bands at approximately 10 , 18 , 23 , 28 , 33 , 40 and 60@xmath0 .",
    "the widths and peak wavelengths of these bands and their relative strengths contain useful information about the crystalline silicate composition ( e.g. the fe / mg ratio ) and stoichiometry ( e.g. olivine @xmath7 or pyroxene @xmath8 where @xmath9 ; see ) .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of evolved stars obtained by _",
    "iso _ and _ spitzer _ so far indicate that circumstellar crystalline silicates all appear to be extremely mg - rich and fe - poor or even fe - free ( i.e. forsterite @xmath10 or enstatite @xmath11 ; see ) .",
    "however , there are several outstanding problems about crystalline silicates remain to be addressed : first , the exact composition and stoichiometry of crystalline silicate dust in evolved stars are not precisely known .",
    "second , the mechanism for making circumstellar crystalline silicates remains debated .",
    "third , it is unclear whether ( and how ) the fraction of silicate dust in crystalline form depends on the mass loss rate , the temperature of the circumstellar dust shell , and the evolutionary stage of an evolved star .",
    "it has also been suggested that high crystallinity ( @xmath110% ) is typically associated with the presence of a disk , rather than being correlated with the mass - loss rate .",
    "further , it is widely believed that interstellar dust originates from stardust produced by evolved stars .",
    "it is puzzling that interstellar silicates are predominantly amorphous @xcite while an appreciable fraction of circumstellar silicates  the primary source of interstellar dust  are crystalline . to improve our understanding of these questions , we plan to systematically explore the spectroscopic properties of astronomical crystalline silicates and their formation , evolution , and dependence on the properties of the parent stars as well as their relevance to interstellar silicates . in this work we present the _ spitzer_/irs spectra of three evolved objects ( iras16456 - 3542 , 18354 - 0638 , and 23239 + 5754 ) all of which display rich sets of crystalline silicate emission features .",
    "this is a part of our ongoing efforts for a systematic investigation of crystalline silicates in evolved stars .",
    "the data were obtained through the _ spitzer _ cycle 3 go proposal ( _ spitzer _ program id30403 ; pi : biwei jiang ) .",
    "sixteen evolved objects ( post - agb stars and pne ) have been observed through this program .",
    "they were selected from the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) _ point source catalog _ ( psc ) , with their iras color indices satisfying @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is to exclude young stellar objects ( ysos ) or galaxies and limit us to evolved stars . in this work we focus on the three sources ( iras16456 - 3542 ,",
    "18354 - 0638 , and 23239 + 5754 ) whose mid - ir spectra are characterized by rich sets of crystalline silicate emission features .",
    "the other ( 13 ) objects will be discussed elsewhere . in table",
    "[ tab : infrared ] we list their ir brightness ( and thus colors ) and their _ simbad _ classification .",
    "these sources were observed using the _ infrared spectrograph _ ( irs ) on board _ spitzer _ with the _ short - high _ ( sh ) and _ long - high _ ( lh ) modules during cycle 3 from june 2006 to may 2007 .",
    "the data were taken in ` staring mode ' at two nod positions along each irs slit .",
    "thanks to the anticipated high brightness of the sources , no specific off - set observations for measuring the background were needed .",
    "the journal of observation is shown in table[tab : observation ] .",
    "we start the data processing from the _ spitzer science center s _ pipeline data set ( version s16.1.0 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 program is used to combine unflatfielded image ( droopres ) and the rogue pixels image from the same campaign for a compound mask , afterwards this combined mask is applied to the flatfielded image ( bcd ) to remove rogue and flagged pixels as much as possible .",
    "the spectra are extracted from the cleaned image in the _ spice _ software package and further analysis is done in the _ smart _ ( version 6.2.6 ) package .    since the lh aperture ( 11.1@xmath1522.3@xmath16 ) is larger than the sh aperture ( 4.7@xmath1511.3@xmath16 ) and it is likely that some sources are so extended that unlike the lh slit , the sh slit could not cover the entire emission area , one sometimes need to multiply a scaling factor in order for the sh flux to agree with the flux of the lh part .",
    "the consequence of the aperture difference shows up clearly in iras23239 + 5754 , for which the sh spectrum must be multiplied by a factor of @xmath55.2 to agree with the lh flux at the overlap part and for the whole spectrum to be consistent with the previous _ msx _ ( midcourse space experiment ) and _ iras _ photometry .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : aor ] , for iras23239 + 5754 the sh slit covers less than half of the emission range while the lh slit covers most of the emission area , confirming a factor of @xmath175.2 difference .",
    "the flux matching between the sh part and the lh part is much better for iras16456 - 3542 , and 18354 - 0638 .",
    "we just need a scale factor of @xmath51.21.3 .",
    "the reduced spectra of these three sources are displayed in figure [ fig : spectra ] , where the objects are ordered in terms of their evolutionary classes : post - agb stars and pne . based on their ionized nebular emission lines ,",
    "we classify iras16456 - 3542 and 23239 + 5754 as pne , consistent with the previous classifications in the literature . for the sources lack of nebular lines ,",
    "they are commonly considered either as post - agb stars or as extremely evolved agb stars . in this context",
    "we classify iras18354 - 0638 as a post - agb star ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the irs wavelength range between 9.9@xmath0 and 37.2@xmath0 is full of spectral features arising from crystalline silicates . in order to clearly illustrate the crystalline silicate features",
    ", we try to subtract the underlying continuum . instead of adopting a single - temperature blackbody spectrum",
    ", we simply fit the global continuum by a mathematical spline function .",

    "60@xmath0 band , are supplemented .",
    "the continuum is then maximized and subtracted . in principle , the strength of the features might be underestimated since there is a possibility that very broad features are mistaken as continuum . after this global continuum subtraction ,",
    "one more step is taken to remove the `` local continuum '' by a third - order polynomial .",
    "the so - called `` local continuum '' refers to the part that is above the global continuum while below the minimum of the features .",
    "this step would possibly further underestimate the strengths of the features .",
    "figure [ fig : continuum ] is an example for subtracting the continuum underneath the spectral features .",

    "we conclude that there must be some evolved stars in which the silicates are even completely crystallized .    under the assumption that the crystalline silicate in the evolved stars has only two forms : enstatite and forsterite ,",
    "the mass ratio of the two forms @xmath36 is approximately 4 , 54 and 24 respectively in these three sources , implying that the main form of crystalline silicate is enstatite i.e. mgsio@xmath37 .",

    "the model fit presented in  [ sec : model ] shows that although most of the crystalline silicate features can be fitted reasonably well in terms of two silicate mineral types ( i.e. forsterite and enstatite ) , some features are not well fitted ( see figure [ fig : modelfit ] ) .",
    "most noticeably , the feature at 32.7@xmath0 , prominent in all three sources and particularly strong in iras18354 - 0638 ( in which the 32.7@xmath0 feature is nearly as strong as the 33.5@xmath0 feature ) , is not accounted for by the current model consisting of forsterite and enstatite minerals .",
    "similarly , the model fails in predicting the features at 29.6 , 30.6 and 31.1@xmath0 seen in all three sources ( see figure [ fig : modelfit ] ) .",
    "we note that the 29.6 , 30.6 and 31.1@xmath0 features seem to comprise a group as they have similar relative intensities in all three sources , with the 29.6@xmath0 feature being the strongest and the 31.1@xmath0 feature being the weakest .",
    "such a phenomenon was also seen in the larger sample of .",
    "one may speculate that these features arise from a dust mineral other than enstatite and forsterite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the overall spectral features at 1035@xmath0 of iras23239 + 5754 and iras16456 - 3542 are similar to each other ( probably because they are both very young pne ) , except that the 29.6@xmath0 feature is much stronger in the older pn iras16456 - 3542 than that in the younger pn iras23239 + 5754 . in summary ,",
    "the modeling approach discussed in  [ sec : model ] assumes three grain types : ( 1 ) spherical amorphous silicates of radii @xmath29=0.1@xmath0 with the indices of refraction taken from ; ( 2 ) crystalline forsterite and ( 3 ) crystalline enstatite for which the mass absorption coefficients are taken from @xcite . for each grain type ,",

    "the equilibrium temperature of dust is sensitive to its size and composition : smaller grains have higher temperatures , and silicates with a higher fe / mg ratio have higher temperatures .",
