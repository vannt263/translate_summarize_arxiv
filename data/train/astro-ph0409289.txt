    "mass is a fundamental property of a star as it is the main parameter which determines the star s main sequence luminosity and temperature , its lifetime on the main sequence , and its subsequent evolution .",
    "the stellar mass - luminosity relation is essential to the determination of many important quantities , such as the stellar initial mass function .",
    "low mass stars are of particular interest : not only are they the most common stars , their long lifetime means they can potentially ` lock up ' a significant fraction of baryons and have a strong influence on galactic - scale physical processes such as chemical evolution . yet in general ,",
    "the masses of stars near the hydrogen burning limit remain poorly known .",
    "furthermore , empirical measurements of mass , as well as radius , are crucial to test our understanding of stellar evolution ( lastennet et  al 2002 ) .",
    "currently , observations of main sequence stars between 1@xmath5 and 10@xmath5 are in good agreement with theoretical stellar evolution models ( andersen 1991 ) , but the models deviate from the data in the optical bands for the majority of stars which are of low - mass , m - dwarf type ( delfosse et  al 2000 , chabrier 2003 ) .    the stellar _ luminosity _ function has recently been determined with high reliability , especially in galactic ( open ) and globular clusters , using both wide field surveys and the hubble space telescope ( e.g. paresce & demarchi 2000 ; elson et  al 1999 ; piotto & zoccali 1999 ) .",
    "extensive field star surveys and open cluster surveys have provided luminosity functions for low mass stellar and substellar objects ( e.g.  bouvier et  al .",
    "2003 ; moraux et  al . 2003",
    "; luhman et  al . 2003 ; santiago , gilmore & elson 1996 ; gizis & reid 1999 ; ) ; hipparcos results provide an accurate and precise luminosity function for apparently luminous stars near the sun ( e.g. kovalevsky 1998 ) .",
    "the stellar luminosity function down into the m - dwarf regime has been determined in such diverse environments as the metal - poor , low - surface brightness satellite galaxies of the milky way ( e.g. the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy ; feltzing , gilmore & wyse 1999 ; wyse et  al 2002 ) and the metal - rich central bulge of the milky way ( zoccali et  al 2000 ) .",
    "these analyses show that the faint stellar luminosity function is universal in form , at all luminosities and in all environments , once one allows for known other effects , particularly binarity in field stars and mass segregation and dynamical evolution in clusters ( e.g.  gilmore 2001 ) .",
    "however , conversion of a luminosity function to a _",
    "mass _ function remains problematic . as emphasized by dantona ( 1998 ) , features such as local peaks in the luminosity function may arise from structure in the mass - luminosity relation , and do not necessarily reflect peaks in the mass function . unfortunately , stellar mass can not be determined directly for the majority of stars . only stars where gravitational effects can be analysed , such as multiple or binary systems , have measurable masses , and these are used to calibrate the stellar mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "detached eclipsing binary stars provide the most accurate determinations ( to @xmath6 ) of stellar mass and radius ( andersen 1991 ) , and analysis of their orbits is a long established technique for empirical calibration and testing of stellar structure models .",
    "these systems place extremely stringent constraints on our understanding of stellar evolution ; they simultaneously provide measurements of the masses and radii for two stars which are ( reasonably ) assumed to have a single age and metallicity .",
    "although the number of well - studied eclipsing binaries with low - mass components is small .",
    "only three eclipsing binary objects with m - dwarf primaries ( and secondaries ) are currently known : yygem ( bopp  1974 ; leung & schneider  1978 ) , cm dra ( lacy  1977 ; metcalfe  1996 ) , and gj  2069a ( delfosse et  al .",
    "these systems were discovered serendipitously and are of unknown age and of uncertain metallicity , two parameters that affect the luminosity and thus the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "for example , a @xmath7 star with metallicity of -1 dex is predicted to be @xmath8 magnitudes brighter in the v - band than a solar metallicity star of the same mass ( baraffe et  al . 1997 ; 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , one of the three known eclipsing systems , cm  dra , has a high space velocity ( @xmath9 ) characterisitic of a population ii star , and thus is likely to have a metallicity less than solar .",
    "although viti et  al .",
    "( 1997 , 2002 ) find discrepancies between the optical and infrared results when they attempt to measure its metallicity , if cm  dra is metal - poor , it will not fall along the same mass - luminosity relation as solar metallicity objects .",
    "radial velocity measurements have also been used to derive orbital solutions , and thus accurate stellar masses , for resolved visual binary systems .",
    "sgransan et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) were able to derive stellar mass to 0.2 - 5% by measuring the radial velocity curve and angular separation of a set of nearby visual binary m - dwarf systems .",
    "further , interferometric techniques have been used to directly measure the angular size , and thus radius , of several nearby low - mass stars ( lane et  al .",
    "2001 ; sgransan 2003 ) .",
    "again however , these are field stars of unknown age and metallicity .    in a study by delfosse et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the set of all mass measurements to date of m - dwarf stars with errors @xmath10 ( 16 binary systems ) was compared to theoretical models of baraffe et  al .",
    "( 1997 ; 1998 ) and siess et  al .",
    "all binary systems in the study have measured parallaxes ( hipparcos , esa 1997 ; yale general catalog of trigonometric parallaxes , van altena 1995 ; sgransan et  al . 2000 ; soderhjelm 1999 ; forveille et  al .",
    "1999 ; benedict et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and their photometry was taken largely from the homogeneous compilation by leggett ( 1992 ) .",
    "the study found that , in the j , h , and k infra - red bands , these data form a low - scatter mass - absolute magnitude sequence and that the theoretical mass - luminosity relation is an good match to the empirical fit to these points for m - dwarf stars between @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the v - band mass - absolute magnitude data , on the other hand , exhibit scatter that is greater than the quoted errors in the measurements ( see figure  [ fig : magfit ] ) .",
    "differing metallicities could be the source of this scatter , but the theoretical models are also systematically offset from the mean data .",
    "for example , the individual components of the binary systems gj 2069a and gl 791.2 are @xmath13 magnitudes too faint in the v - band compared to the mean empirical mass - absolute magnitude relation ( delfosse et  al . 1999 ; benedict et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "further , the solar metallicity models of baraffe et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) are too luminous by @xmath14 magnitude at a given mass below @xmath15 ( delfosse et  al . 2000 and references therein )    it is a prediction of these same models that the metallicity is an important factor in determining the appropriate optical mass - luminosity relation .",
    "the spectra of late - k and m dwarfs are complex to analyse so that direct metallicity estimates are uncertain ( e.g. gizis 1997 ; gizis & reid 1997 ) ; this is an unavoidable limitation in the use of field binary systems .",
    "further , the models adopted have an age of 5 gyr , but there are no age estimates for the systems in the field .",
    "a @xmath16 star is expected to dim by approximately one magnitude as it ages from 200 myr to 5 gyr ( baraffe et  al .",
    "1998 ) and younger stars are brighter still ; this is a further source of uncertainty .    in order to provide a better calibration of the mass - luminosity - radius relation , test models of stellar structure and evolution , and determine the contribution of low - mass stars to the global mass census in the galaxy",
    ", we have undertaken a photometric monitoring survey targeting k / m - dwarf stars ( @xmath17 ) in open clusters with a range of metallicities and ages which is known from the upper main sequence cluster members .",
    "we have selected for this study six open clusters with a range of ages from @xmath18 gyr and metallicities from @xmath19 dex to approximately solar ( table  [ tab : cluslis ] ) .",
    "we obtained observations of each cluster over an area of greater than 1 square degree per target , well beyond the characteristic radius defined by the brighter stars .",
    "additional products of our survey are deep optical color magnitude diagrams ( v , v - i ) over a wide fov which will be used to determine spatial variations in the mass functions .",
    "we will investigate dynamical effects in open clusters as a function of age , such as mass segregation ( e.g. hurley et  al .",
    "2001 ; raboud & mermilliod 1998 ; bonatto & bica 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , our data are sufficiently precise to provide improved determination of the intrinsic photometric stability of g - dwarf stars in the clusters ; this is a necessary input to ongoing and future transit searches for earth - like planets around solar analogs .",

    "future papers in this series will discuss the analysis of the photometric data for low - mass stars in the individual clusters , including candidate eclipsing k / m - dwarf binary systems ; follow - up spectroscopy and high frequency photometry of candidate systems ; the photometric stability of sun - like g - dwarf stars ; the radial profiles of the clusters as traced by stars of different masses , and the relation to mass segregation ; and the photometric search for variability of non - cluster field stars .",
    "candidate low - mass eclipsing binary stars are detected through variations in their apparent brightness as one star in the binary passes in front of the other along the line of sight . for an eclipse to occur",
    ", the orbital inclination , @xmath20 , must be close to @xmath21 ; this constraint on @xmath20 has the disadvantage that the probability of @xmath22 is low .",
    "the periods and eclipse durations of known eclipsing m - dwarf binaries may be used to define an effective observing strategy .",
    "the three known systems have the following orbital properties : cm  dra has a period , @xmath23 days , orbital inclination @xmath24 , and duration @xmath25 hours ( lacy 1977 ) ; yy gem has @xmath26 days , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 hours ( leung & schneider 1978 ) ; and gj 2069a has @xmath29 days , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 hours ( delfosse et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we perform an analytic calculation using simple scaling arguments to define an initial estimate of the relevant parameters for a binary search .",
    "the total mass of a binary system with an m - dwarf primary will not differ from @xmath32 by more than a factor of two either way .",
    "the range of possible separations ( and hence periods ) will be much larger , and thus one can safely adopt a total mass of @xmath33 as a reference .",
    "for such a system , and inclination @xmath34 , one may calculate the eclipse duration from estimates of the angles subtended by the stars and their angular orbital speed , with duration @xmath35 ( angular size / angular speed ) . from kepler s laws the angular frequency @xmath36 , ( with @xmath37 the separation between the stars ) , while the angle subtended by the primary at the secondary goes as @xmath38 , so there is only weak dependence ( scaling like @xmath39 ) of the eclipse duration on the separation . for low mass stars , stellar radius and mass follow @xmath40 ,",
    "so that the angle , @xmath41 , subtended at the secondary by the primary ( @xmath42 ) is typically @xmath43 scaling from the angular speed at 1au for a 1  solar mass system , close to 1  degree per day , implies that a representative eclipse duration is @xmath44 hours for periods from 1 day to 1 year .",
    "this is well - matched to observational convenience and , by construction , to the observed eclipse duration for the few known m - dwarf systems .    for random orientations of the orbital plane , the probability that @xmath20 lies in the range",
    "@xmath45 follows the usual cos(@xmath20 ) scaling . adopting the mass - radius relationship @xmath46 as above , for a system of @xmath47 at a separation corresponding to a period of 1 day , an eclipse requires that the inclination must be @xmath48 ; at a period of 100 days ( mercury s orbit ) , the required inclination is @xmath49 , and at a period equal to 1 year , @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding probabilities of this alignment are 0.17 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the distribution function of expected separations and periods is ill - determined .",
    "however , it is clear from these small probabilities of appropriate inclination angle that a sample of order several thousand m - dwarf stars must be observed to have a few eclipsing m - dwarf systems .",
    "the number of star - hours which must be observed to detect these systems depends on the duty cycle of an eclipse which ranges from 0.05 at periods of 1 day to 0.002 at periods of 100 days .",
    "this requires a wide field , so that one can efficiently survey a large number of stars repeatedly , in order to detect variability .",
    "an independent and more robust calculation may be derived through monte carlo simulations of an ensemble of binary systems .",
    "we carried out the simulations to calculate the probability of observing low - mass binaries in their eclipse phase and their expected light variations ( period , duration ) .",
    "these allow us to estimate the scope of the required survey ( e.g.  number of star - hours ) and the optimal timescales for monitoring the clusters .",
    "the simulations require as input the distribution of orbital parameters of binary systems and the intrinsic characteristics of late - k and m - dwarf type stars , such as absolute magnitude and radius .",
    "the distribution of orbital parameters of low - mass binary systems are not yet established due to the difficulty of obtaining good statistics from the limited number of systems known .",
    "thus we based our simulations on distributions of binary parameters for g - dwarf systems given by duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 , hereafter dm91 ) and , at the suggestion of the referee , those found by halbwachs et  al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter hmua03 ) for f7 to k - dwarf spectroscopic binary systems .",
    "dm91 carried out an analysis of a local , distance limited set of binary stars with g - dwarf primaries and found ( i ) the period distribution is approximately log - normal with a mean of 180 years ; ( ii ) short period binaries ( @xmath53 days ) tend to have circular orbits ; ( iii ) binaries with @xmath54 have a peaked eccentricity distribution with @xmath55 ; and ( iv ) for @xmath56 days the eccentricity distribution , @xmath57 , tends toward @xmath58 .",
    "further , these data are consistent with the primary and secondary stars being drawn independently from the same initial mass function ( imf ) .    the more recent paper by halbwachs et al .",
    "2003 agreed with the period and eccentricity distributions defined in dm91 , but observed a different mass - ratio , @xmath59 , distribution than that which would be derived if two stars were drawn independently from the same imf .",
    "hmua03 found a q - distribution with a broad peak from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and a sharp peak for @xmath62 ( twins ) in their sample of 89 spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the results of hmua03 suggest that the number of @xmath62 systems tends to decrease with increasing period and that these same systems tend to have smaller eccentricities than lower mass - ratio systems with similar periods .",
    "these trends are marginally significant and were not quantified in the paper , therefore we did not incorporate them into our simulations .      in the simulations , we adopted the period and eccentricity distributions from dm91 and tested both the hmua03 and dm91 mass - ratio distributions .",
    "we populated a model open cluster with primary stars drawn from a multi - part power - law imf following kroupa ( 2001 ) with a slope @xmath63 for @xmath64 and a slope @xmath65 for stars of mass @xmath66 .",
    "although observations show the stellar multiplicity fraction is a function of primary mass ( e.g. sterzik & durisen 2003 ) , we are interested only in this fraction in the mass range of m - dwarf stars . therefore we created binary systems out of 35% ( e.g. reid & gizis 1997 ( 35% ) ; fischer & marcy 1992 ( 42% ) ; marchal et  al .",
    "2003 ) of m - dwarf stars in the simulated cluster between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we ran two sets of simulations , using dm91 and hmua03 to define the mass of the secondary star based on the observational results in each paper .    in the first set of simulations",
    ", we chose independently a secondary star from the same imf ( following dm91 ) .",
    "it is unknown whether brown dwarfs pair in binaries in the same fashion as solar - type stars thus we confined our simulations to only stellar mass systems , not brown dwarfs . a random orbital inclination , _ i _ ,",
    "was assigned to each binary ( @xmath69 being edge - on ) , along with a period drawn from the log - normal distribution with a mean of 180 years , following dm91 .",
    "knowing the period , the major axis distance , _ a _ , was then calculated using kepler s laws and an eccentricity was adopted using the appropriate distribution according to dm91 . for systems defined to be on non - circular orbits , we also chose a random angle between zero and @xmath70 radians which defines an orientation for the elliptical orbit .    in the second set of simulations we picked a mass - ratio , @xmath59 , for each binary from a distribution which reproduces the general trends found by hmua03 .",
    "we parameterized the @xmath59 distribution as the sum of three standard gaussians with mean , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and normalization , @xmath73 , values of @xmath71=1.0/0.6/0.3 , @xmath72=0.01/0.01/0.02 , and @xmath73=0.8/0.42/0.5 for the three gaussians .",
    "the ensemble of @xmath59 values combined with their corresponding primary masses define the masses of secondary stars in the simulated binary systems .",
    "again we assigned an inclination angle , a period , an eccentricity , and a viewing angle to each simulated binary system and calculated the semi - major axis distance using kepler s laws .    in accordance with observational evidence for the `` brown dwarf desert '' ( marcy & butler 2000 ; halbwachs et  al .",
    "2000 ; zucker & mazeh 2001 ) , the lack of brown dwarf companions in short period ( @xmath74 au ) binary systems , if a @xmath59 value chosen in the simulation produces a secondary star in the brown dwarf regime ( @xmath75 ) for a system with a period less than 1000 days , we reassign that primary object as a single star .",
    "this skews the adopted mass - ratio distribution for late type m - dwarfs to slightly higher @xmath59 values and introduces a small trend toward smaller binary fraction with decreasing primary mass .",
    "this is reasonable considering the mass - ratio distribution for low - mass m - dwarf stars is unconstrained and we reproduce the observed trend of decreasing binary fraction with decreasing primary mass while accounting for the observed brown dwarf desert .",
    "the individual components of the simulated low - mass binary systems were then assigned an absolute v - band magnitude and radius defined by their mass .",
    "the mass - absolute magnitude relation we adopted is based on an empirical fit to the limited existing data for m - dwarf stars .",
    "we fit the lowest order polynomial which reproduced the broad trends in the data compiled by delfosse et  al .",
    "the fit is given by @xmath76 for a given mass , @xmath77 , and is plotted with the data in figure  [ fig : magfit]a . as there are only three well - studied eclipsing binary m - dwarf systems ( six stars ) with accurate radius measurements , we adopted the homology scaling for low - mass stars , @xmath78 .",
    "we show the data together with the adopted mass - radius relation in figure  [ fig : magfit]b .",
    "low - mass eclipsing binary systems in the simulations are defined as binary objects that satisfy the following criteria : the primary component has a mass in the range @xmath79 ; the inclination angle allows for eclipses , requiring @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the radii of the primary and secondary stars and @xmath83 is the shortest separation between the two binary components when viewed at the chosen orientation ; and the system must be a detached binary , requiring that the separation , @xmath83 , be greater than the roche limit of the secondary star .    finally , determining the likelihood of capturing the eclipsing systems while in their eclipse phase depends on the observing window function ( e.g. sampling rate , number of hours observed ) . in general the short period binaries that eclipse more frequently and spend a greater percentage of their time in the eclipse phase are most easily observed .",
    "we applied a window function to the simulated low - mass eclipsing binary systems designed to reproduce a possible observing run .",
    "we chose a starting position for the secondary star from a distribution proportional to its inverse orbital speed and assumed observations were taken with a sampling rate of one per hour over a ten hour observing night for four consecutive nights .",
    "we ran 1000 realizations of the simulation for each mass - ratio distribution and show , in figure  [ fig : qpcontour ] , the type of eclipsing binary systems we are likely to detect .",
    "the figure is a contour plot of mass ratio versus period with the contour level marking the percentage of low - mass ( @xmath84 ) eclipsing binary systems in the simulation which were detected with the sampling function described above and have a amplitude @xmath85 magnitudes .",
    "the solid line is the result of the simulations with the hmua03 q - distribution and the dotted line is the same for the set of simulations assuming random pairing of binaries from the same imf ( following dm91 ) .",
    "as expected , we are most likely to detect small period , high mass ratio systems .",
    "further , the two mass - ratio distributions give nearly the same results .",
    "although the small scale structure of the distributions appears very different , the broad trends are not .",
    "@xmath86 of the binaries created using the hmua03 q - distribution have @xmath87 and @xmath88 have @xmath89 as opposed to @xmath90 and @xmath91 if the q - distribution is derived assuming randomly paired binaries from a single imf .",
    "we found , for both q - distributions , that most detected eclipsing binary systems in the simulation favor short period orbits , with @xmath92 having periods @xmath93 days .",
    "these are on circular orbits , according to dm91 .",
    "@xmath94 of detected systems have duration , @xmath95 , between @xmath96 hours .",
    "there is a slight difference in the resulting eclipse amplitude values for the two different input mass - ratio distributions .",
    "@xmath97 of detected systems have a maximum eclipse depth greater than @xmath98 when the hmua03 q - distribution was adopted and approximately @xmath99 when binary systems were formed from randomly paired stars ( following dm91 ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : monte ] the duration and amplitude distributions for the detected low - mass eclipsing systems in the simulations . again",
    "the solid line is the result of the simulations assuming the hmua03 q - distribution and the dotted line is the same for the dm91 q - distribution .",
    "these results are well - matched to the characteristics of the known eclipsing binary m - dwarfs and to the results of the simple scaling arguments above .",
    "we then tested different sampling rates and total observing hours to asses the effect of the observing window function on the eclipse detection efficiency .",
    "figure  [ fig : hoursobs ] shows a plot of the percent of the simulated eclipsing binaries detected as a function of observing hours .",
    "the three different lines represent 20 minute ( solid line ) , 40 minute ( dotted ) and 1 hour ( dashed ) sampling cadences .",
    "the detection efficiency was largely unaffected by whether or not the simulated observing nights were consecutive .",
    "we thus designed our survey to achieve a photometric sampling rate of at least 1 pair of photometric measurements per hour ( i.e. double correlated sampling ) . a minimum sensitivity to enable the detection of a @xmath100 mag amplitude eclipse in an average target primary star of @xmath101",
    "is required , although much better photometric precision is desirable and achieved ( @xmath1023 mmag precision at @xmath4 ) . furthermore to be consistent with evidence for the brown dwarf desert ( marcy & butler 2000 ; halbwachs et  al .",
    "2000 ; zucker & mazeh 2001 ) , we did not include short period brown dwarfs in our simulations , but if such systems exist we would be able to detect their eclipse signature .",
    "a @xmath103 ( age @xmath104 gyr ) brown dwarf orbiting a @xmath7 star in an edge - on binary system would eclipse producing @xmath105 magnitude amplitude signature that would be detected in our survey .",
    "detecting an eclipsing object requires data that cover multiple events , which may be both primary and/or secondary eclipses ; thus we monitored the clusters on timescales of hours , days , and months .",
    "this provides phase and period information necessary for follow - up observations such as radial velocity curves and more detailed photometric coverage .",
    "further , m - dwarf stars show chromospheric activity , including h@xmath106 emission line flares , and have sunspots which may mimic shallow eclipses , so color information , here v and i , are optimal for distinguishing such events from genuine eclipses .",
    "finally , our simulations show that 0.08% of the cluster stars between @xmath107 and @xmath108 are eclipsing m - dwarf binaries , @xmath109 % of which have amplitudes greater than 0.05 magnitudes , and a further 1/3 of those are detected during the simple 40 hour observing window function we adopted for the simulations .",
    "therefore , @xmath110  cluster star hours are required to detect 5 eclipsing binary m - dwarfs in the open clusters .",
    "the total star hours required scales directly with the assumed binary fraction for m - dwarf stars which we have reasonably adopted to be 35% , consistent with the value determined for field m - dwarf stars .",
    "the selected open clusters satisfy the following criterion : they are old enough for m - dwarfs to have settled onto the main sequence ( setting a lower limit @xmath111 years , baraffe et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , their figure 3 ) ; their distance modulus is small enough that m - dwarfs are accessible for both photometric monitoring and spectroscopic follow - up in a reasonable time , @xmath112 ; the reddening is low ( @xmath113 ) ; the clusters are rich enough to allow efficient monitoring of many stars ; and they are distributed in ra and dec to allow efficient observing during normal tac allocations .",

    "pointing , we took single short exposures to provide high s / n data for solar - type stars without saturating them , and pairs of longer exposures to provide the requisite data for the fainter k and m - dwarfs which are our primary targets .",
    "we obtained at least one complete set of exposures at each field center in each of the two filters used , in order to make a complete color - magnitude diagram of all the clusters .",
    "subsequent repeat observations of each central cluster pointing were taken in both v and i ( or i ) , but the flanking fields were repeated only in the i ( or i ) filter .",
    "the weather was generally good during our observing runs .",
    "we observed 23/35 photometric nights and lost only 7 full nights due to very poor weather .",
    "only differential photometry is necessary for the primary science goals of this survey , but standard star fields were observed on photometric nights during each of the runs to provide calibrated cmds .",
    "it should be noted that standard star sequences are available in some of our clusters , facilitating this calibration .",
    "the int data were processed through the standard int wide field survey pipeline created by the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) and designed specifically as a data reduction tool for int - wfc mosaic images .",
    "the pipeline processing treats each ccd in the mosaic independently and includes bias subtraction , correction for the non - linearity in the ccds ( see http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath102wfcsur/foibles.php ) , bad pixel interpolation , flat fielding , defringing , and gain correction which scales the whole mosaic to a uniform background level .",
    "the same processing steps were applied to the data collected during each observing run .    for each run , the first step was to combine a large number , typically @xmath127 , of individual bias frames into a single 2-d master bias image for the entire run .",
    "all science and calibration frames were debiased using this stacked master bias image together with the overscan section associated with each chip .",
    "any known bad pixels were then flagged and interpolated over .",
    "the frames were then trimmed and corrected for the non - linearity in the ccds .",
    "master twilight flat - field images for each entire run were created in each of v and ( i or i ) using the following procedure : fifteen individual images for each filter were averaged using a @xmath128 clipping algorithm , and the appropriate stacked flat - field was then scaled and divided into each data frame . after applying the flat - field , a fringe pattern was visible in those i - band images with exposure times longer than",
    "7s ( shorter exposures have a background dominated by random noise ) . in general , our science observing program did not provide enough diverse frames with which to create a master fringe frame with sufficient signal - to - noise since we did not dither the individual observations .",
    "thus , for all runs after the first ( july 2002 ) we observed non - cluster dark sky fields each night which were combined into a master fringe frame for that run .",
    "we averaged @xmath129 images of distinct dark parts of the sky using a @xmath130 clipping algorithm to remove objects .",
    "the only exception was the july 2002 observing run during which no dark sky images were observed and for which we used a fringe frame taken from the int wfc archives ( dated february 2002 ) .",
    "the appropriate fringe - map was then scaled and subtracted from all i - band program frames for that run with exposure times longer than 7s .",
    "finally , all four ccds in the mosaic were scaled to the same mean background sky level .    at the completion of the processing",
    ", we examined many individual images by eye and observed no residual flat - field or fringe features . in order to obtain a more quantitative measure of the degree of residual flat - field and fringe variation left in the images after the data reduction we tested a sample of 10 images .",
    "we generously masked out all objects detected at @xmath131 above the background until we obtained a sample of pixels containing only sky .",
    "we compared the standard deviation of the sky values for the entire chip with the expected sigma assuming only poisson counting errors . on all 10 test images , we determined the sky variation to be @xmath132 .",
    "the mosaic data were reduced using both the iraf / mscred ( valdes 1998 ) package and a toolkit based on the int - wfc pipeline that has been adapted by casu for use in processing all types of multi - extension fits files generated by mosaic detectors .",
    "the same data processing steps were used for each observing run and are outlined below .",

    "we used calibration files generated from data taken on august 30 , 2002 to correct our september 2002 and january 2003 data , and files generated on march 28 , 2003 were used on our february 2003 and june 2003 data .",
    "next , for each run we combined 20 - 25 individual bias frames into a single master 2-d bias image .",
    "the master bias frame was subtracted from all mosaic images which were then overscan corrected and trimmed .",

    "we observed @xmath133 dithered dark - sky images and processed them with the program frames .",

    "the masks were used when combining the individual images into a master dark - sky flat in each filter with the _ mscred.sflatcombine _ task . finally , we smoothed the master dark - sky flat with a 7x7 pixel box filter .",
    "the 7-pixel box was small enough so as not to smooth out any residual flat - field features , but large enough to reduce the noise in the final dark - sky flat to the level of a typical flat - field .",
    "we did not apply dark - sky flats to any exposures @xmath134 as the background level was very low and the application of the dark - sky flats only added noise .    the mosaic images taken at the kpno-4 m had an instrumental feature in the i - band images , a scattered light image of the pupil .",
    "the scattered light image is an additive feature , not a multiplicative feature , so can not be removed with the application of the flat - field .",
    "we tested the mscred tasks _ mscpupil _ and _ rmpupil _ , and the casu toolkit routine _",
    "fitsio_scatter _ , designed to remove the feature .",
    "the casu toolkit routine was consistently better able to fit and remove the low level feature in our crowded star fields .",
    "the routine performs a post - flat - field correction to the data image , @xmath135 , by performing the following arithmetic on the   where @xmath136 is the normalized pupil image , @xmath137 is a @xmath130 clipped measure of the median sky value of the data image , and @xmath138 is the corrected output .",
    "the input pupil image was created by simply dividing a smoothed dark - sky flat by the same dark - sky flat which was removed of its scattered light with the _ mscpupil _ task and then smoothed .    at this stage of data",
    "reduction , fringing was still visible in the i - band images .",
    "the same science frames used to create the dark - sky flat  now post both twilight and dark - sky flat application  were combined with object masks into a final fringe frame which was then scaled and subtracted from all the i - band science images with exposure times @xmath139 . after completing all the data processing , we tested a sample of 10 mosaic images in the same fashion as described above for the int data and found residual instrumental signatures left in the mosaic data to be @xmath132 .",
    "any residual instrumental variations should not affect our ability to detect eclipse signatures .",
    "although the large scale residual features are of amplitude 1% , we are performing differential photometry locally on each ccd , thus only systematic spatial variations on scales on the order the offset between individual exposures ( typically less than 10 pixels ) are relevant .",
    "these are far less than any large scale residual features as seen by our final photometric precision discussed below .      at this point ,",
    "all instrumental signatures have been removed from the data .",
    "all science frames taken at the int and kpno were then processed using the casu catalogue extraction software which includes source detection , aperture photometry , astrometry and morphological classification ( http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath102wfcam/documentation.html ; irwin & lewis 2001 ) .",
    "the source detection algorithm defines an object as a set of contiguous pixels above a defined detection threshold .",
    "the routine requires as input the detection limit in units of background @xmath72 and the minimum number of connected pixels above that threshold which define an object .",
    "since we have multiple exposures of each field with which to establish the reality of a detection , we can set a low detection threshold of @xmath131 and a small minimum source size of 5 pixels , while requiring that all ` real ' objects be detected in both the v and i ( or i ) band stacked master images .",
    "we applied confidence maps , which define dead pixels and other problems on the detector , with the detection routine in order to limit further the number of false detections .",
    "we also employed the deblending option which attempts to deconvolve any overlapping objects . for each detected object , aperture photometry",
    "is performed with five discrete apertures , and these measurements are used in a curve - of - growth analysis to define the total flux in the object ( irwin 2001 ; hall & mackay 1984 ) .",
    "we chose the value of the core aperture to be 4  pixels , which corresponds to @xmath140 on the kpno images and to @xmath141 on the int images .",
    "all flux measurements are corrected for the varying pixel scale across the detector , which is significant for the wide - field detectors we are using ( @xmath6 for int - wfc and @xmath142 for the kpno - mosaic ) .",
    "objects are then classified as stellar , non - stellar , or noise , based on the combination of radial profile and ellipticity .",
    "we will derive light curves for each detected object based on an automated identification technique that finds the same object in subsequent frames based on its coordinates in the world coordinate system ( wcs ) .",
    "for this , the initial astrometric solution present in the image headers is not sufficient .",
    "we refined it iteratively by comparing the positions of detected objects with those in the usno - a v2.0 catalogue of astrometric standards ( monet 1998 ) .",
    "we obtained an updated astrometric solution with an internal precision of @xmath143 and an external precision limited by the usno data of @xmath144 .",
    "although only differential photometry is required for our primary science goals , we did observe several standard star fields during each photometric observing night including the standard star fields in two of our target clusters , m67 and ngc  6940 .",
    "the standard fields were processed along with the science frames as described above , and aperture photometry , with a 4 pixel aperture , was performed on the processed images .",
    "an aperture correction derived from the curve of growth analysis was added to the instrumental magnitudes .",
    "we transformed the observed standard stars according to the following equations : @xmath145 @xmath146 where @xmath147 are the catalogued magnitudes of the standard stars , @xmath148 are the instrumental magnitudes , and @xmath149 is the airmass .",

    "we observed stetson ( stetson 2000 ) photometric standard fields which extend the landolt ( landolt 1992 ) standards to fainter stars with a larger color range ( @xmath152 ) . in january and february 2003 , we observed the standard star sequence in the m67 field defined by montgomery et  al .",

    "all positions are corrected for the radial geometric distortion prior to the transformation , and the final error in the transformed coordinates is @xmath183 pixels .",
    "we then perform aperture photometry , as described in ",
    "[ ssec : casu ] , on each image at the positions defined in the master list .",
    "the ` light curves ' that would be obtained from the sequence of measurements obtained in this way contain both intrinsic variability and variations due to other effects such as changes in the seeing , the airmass , the zero point , and the overall transparency of a particular image .",
    "we need to remove all non - intrinsic effects ; our underlying assumption in deriving differential light curves is that most stars in a given image have no intrinsic variability .",
    "we use the brightest stars on each image to determine the differential offset for all stars on that frame .",
    "further , in order to generate light curves with the smallest possible scatter we use different aperture sizes for stars of different magnitudes . for each of the five pointings per cluster field ,",
    "we calculate the mean magnitude ( with a @xmath130 rejection ) over all observations of each bright isolated star ( @xmath184 ) within three different apertures ( @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 with @xmath188 pixels ) .",
    "we then determine the @xmath130-clipped mean offset between the individual bright star magnitudes and their corresponding mean values for each ccd chip of each individual observation .",
    "for each star in the master list , we then create a set of three ( one for each aperture ) differential lightcurves by correcting the magnitudes measured on each image with the corresponding offsets derived from the bright stars .",
    "we also determine the standard deviation in each individual lightcurve",
    ". ideally , the three lightcurves for each star should be the same , but in reality they exhibit different scatter about the mean .",

    "the value of a pixel corresponds to the differential magnitude of a given star on a single observation ; the lighter pixels correspond to brighter magnitudes .",

    "several potential variable stars are visible in the image as individual rows with larger than average changes in the pixel value .",
    "we use similar images to check for systematics in our differential lightcurve data , e.g. spurious position - dependent effects .",

    "figure  [ fig : m67rmsclus ] shows such a plot for the stars defined as potential cluster members for m67 ( marked by open circles in figure  [ fig : m67cmd ] ) .",
    "objects with rms @xmath197 above the median error level are potential variables .",
    "upon further examination , these objects include long - period variables and continuously varying objects both of which deviate from their median brightness over a significant portion of their lightcurves .",
    "also included are objects with large - amplitude deviations from their median brightness .",
    "these large variations can be due to either intrinsic stellar variability or artificial sources in the data .",
    "low mass eclipsing binary systems which show short , low - amplitude variations in brightness in a majority constant lightcurve do not exhibit large rms values associated with their lightcurves . in order to illustrate this point , we randomly selected from our sample a subset of objects which cover the magnitude range of the entire sample .",
    "we added an eclipse signal with a 0.05 magnitude amplitude , a duration of 2 hours , and a period of 1.6 days to their lightcurves .",
    "we plot the rms values of the original and eclipse - added lightcurves in figure  [ fig : rms_addeclipse ] .",
    "we mark the rms value of the original lightcurves with an open circle and the rms value of the same lightcurve with the artificial eclipse signal added as an open star . with the addition of the eclipse signal , the global rms value of the lightcurves change by several mmag .",
    "the amplitude of the added eclipse is an order of magnitude greater than the standard deviation in the brighter stars , thus the addition of the eclipse signal has a significant affect on the rms value at the bright end .",
    "low - mass eclipsing binaries , on the other hand , are still indistinguishable from typical non - variable objects in this data .",
    "therefore , we consider other approaches to detecting eclipse signatures in the lightcurves .",
    "we designed our observing strategy so that pairs of observations were taken at each field pointing in order to provide immediate confirmation of each photometric measurement .",
    "this enabled us to detect variable objects using the stetson j - index ( stetson 1996 ) which is specifically designed for programs in which multiple observations are obtained closely spaced in time . in a dataset consisting of pairs of magnitudes with purely random noise",
    ", the j - index for a non - variable star tends toward zero ; true variable objects will have positive j - index values .",
    "the residual of one magnitude measurement from the mean of all measurements is defined for each point on the lightcurve .",
    "the residual values for each pair of observations are multiplied together and the j - index is the weighted sum of these combined residuals over all pairs .",
    "the technique has a tendency to diminish the importance of individual bad data points ( e.g. cosmic rays ) , but the index will be more sensitive to signals in the data in which the pairs of observations deviate from the mean in the same direction .",
    "thus , the j - index should be more sensitive than the simple @xmath72 clipping algorithm described above to eclipsing variables , but it also amplifies defects in the data that affect both observations closely paired in time .",
    "for example , magnitude variations due to blending with other objects is a function of the data quality which would be similar for both individual measurements in the pair .",
    "figure  [ fig : stetsonj ] shows a plot of the j - index as a function of i - band magnitude for objects in the field of ngc  1647 . like the rms plot ,",
    "the j - index distribution is continuous , and there is no clear separation between variable and non - variable stars .",
    "again , we add artificial eclipse signals to the same subset of stars discussed above and plot their original j - index values as large open circles in figure  [ fig : stetsonj_addeclipse ] along with the j - index values of the lightcurves with the added eclipse as large open stars .",
    "the addition of the low amplitude eclipse increases the j - index value for all stars in the randomly chosen subset , but the eclipsing objects are still not clearly distinguishable from the majority of non - variable stars . while we expected an improvment in the eclipse detection for the j - index over the simple @xmath72-clipping ,",
    "in fact this was not evident given the sampling of our data .",
    "neither technique described above is efficient at detecting the signatures of low - mass eclipsing binary stars in lightcurves with non - gaussian noise properties , thus we investigate algorithms designed more specifically for this purpose .",
    "tingley ( 2003a,2003b ) compared transit / eclipse detection algorithms and concluded that a modified version of the box fitting algorithm by kovcs et  al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter kzm ) gave the best performance overall , although marginally , when compared to various matched filter and bayesian algorithms .",
    "although no detection algorithm is clearly superior for all eclipse signals of varying strengths , we chose to use the kzm algorithm since it is designed specifically to detect periodic signals which alternate between two discrete levels , as in transits and eclipses .",
    "the routine fits a square step function to the phase - folded lightcurve : by assuming the transiting system spends the majority of its time out of the eclipse phase , this algorithm is able to find the best fitting function by minimizing the simple expression @xmath198    here , @xmath199 is the total number of points in the lightcurve , @xmath200 is the value ( differential magnitude ) of each data point in the phase - folded lightcurve , @xmath201 is the normalized weight of each point given by @xmath202 ( where @xmath203 is the familiar gaussian standard deviation ) , @xmath83 is the sum of the weights during the eclipse / transit and @xmath204 is the weighted sum of @xmath200 over the in - transit points .",
    "the routine tests a grid of periods , transit phases , and durations , in order to find the minimum @xmath135 .",
    "minimizing @xmath135 is equivalent to maximizing the signal residue , @xmath205\\ ] ] for each tested period .",
    "following kzm , we determine the signal residue for each trial period , and finally calculate the signal detection efficiency , @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the highest value of @xmath208 over all tested periods , @xmath209 is the the mean value of @xmath208 , and @xmath210 is the standard deviation .",
    "( we check by eye all potential eclipsing objects with @xmath211 depending on the sampling of the data . )    in our implementation of the algorithm we test a grid of periods and eclipse durations on all the lightcurves .",
    "we sample periods between 0.5 to 11 days in intervals of 0.01 days for those clusters for which we have a sufficiently long temporal baseline of observations , as in m67 , m35 , and ic4756 . for the other three clusters , we test periods to half the time extent of the observations .",
    "we test transit / eclipse durations between 0.02 and 0.25 days , @xmath14 to 6 hours .",
    "the detection efficiency and the type of eclipsing variables which are most likely to be detected with this method depend on the sampling function of the actual data and will be discussed in detail in further analysis papers . although in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm , we show , in figure  [ fig : srperiod ] , a plot of the sde versus i - band magnitude for a set of simulated lightcurves with rms values and sampling frequency chosen to match the m35 cluster data .",
    "we add an eclipse signal with a period of 1.6 days , a duration of @xmath13 hours and an amplitude of 0.05 magnitudes to the lightcurves and compare the value of the period and sde recovered from the box - fitting algorithm .",
    "the algorithm detects the eclipse signature in the lightcurves and recovers the correct period for stars with @xmath212 where the rms of the lightcurve is approximately the eclipse amplitude ( 0.05 magnitudes ) . within this magnitude range",
    ", the simulated lightcurves with the eclipse signal have sde values @xmath104 and are clearly distinguishable from the same lightcurves without the added eclipse .",
    "further , in figure  [ fig : m35lcurve ] , we show an example of the phase - folded lightcurve of a candidate m - dwarf eclipsing binary system in the m35 cluster detected using this technique .",
    "the best fitting period was found to be 1.09 days with an eclipse duration of @xmath213 1 hour and amplitude of 0.07 magnitudes .",
    "we have described our survey of six galactic clusters designed to detect low mass eclipsing binary stars with known age and metallicity .",
    "the data necessary to calibrate and test stellar structure models of low - mass stars is still lacking , particularly mass and metallicity information on the same stars and sufficient numbers of accurate stellar radii measurments .",
    "we explained the observations and processing steps applied to the survey data .",
    "we have also detailed our algorithms for generating lightcurves , selecting potential cluster members , and determining potential eclipsing systems through their variability characteristics . calibrated photometry catalogues of all objects in the wide - fov centered on each cluster , including",
    "all our variable object detections will follow in subsequent papers . according to our simulations",
    "we expect to find @xmath104 low - mass eclipsing binary stars within our clusters .",
    "we have processed the entire dataset including a determination of the photometric calibration equations for all photometric nights of data .",
    "we also plan use our data to define the degree of mass segregation present in each cluster which can be used to test dynamical evolution models of clusters and to study galactic structure through analysis of the field populations in the data .",
    "thanks mike irwin for helpful advice and for making available to us the casu data processing software . l.h . also thanks imants platais and peter mccullough for discussions and suggestions .",
