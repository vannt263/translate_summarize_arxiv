    "the time lag is combined with the line width to give an estimate of smbh mass .",
    "this , in principal , makes it immediately applicable for both faint and distant quasars .",

    "the @xmath8 , on the other hand , is insensitive to line blends and errors in the continuum and iron subtraction .",
    "in addition , @xmath8 is easily measured , however it probably provides a poor estimate of the velocity dispersion for irregularly shaped lines profiles .",
    "@xcite compared the strengths and weaknesses of these two measurements and concluded that @xmath30 was the better parameter when measured in the rms spectrum .    in order to choose the better ses estimate of the blr velocity dispersion ,",

    ", we use the @xmath8 as an estimate of the velocity dispersion throughout the rest of this analysis .",

    "this is about a factor of two larger than the value @xmath267 dex found for h@xmath10 by @xcite , where we have converted the value @xmath268 to dex .",
    "this larger scatter in the c iv @xmath2@xmath1 relationship implies that the h@xmath10 mass estimates are more efficient than the c iv ones .",
    "however , @xcite found that the h@xmath10 mass estimates have a statistical scatter of @xmath269 dex , and thus are just as accurate as the c iv - based ones .",
    "this larger value of @xmath270 implies that either there is significant uncertainty in using the ses h@xmath10 line width to estimate the blr velocity dispersion , @xmath271 , or that there are additional sources of uncertainty in the broad line mass estimates beyond the scatter in the @xmath2@xmath1 relationship and the uncertainty in using the ses line width instead of the variable component line width .",
    "if there are additional sources of scatter in the ses mass estimates , then @xmath266 dex represents an upper bound on the c iv @xmath2@xmath1 relationship scatter .",
    "equation ( [ ionpar ] ) implies that the scatter in the @xmath2@xmath1 relationship is the result of variations in the blr ionization parameter , gas density , and average ionizing photon energy .",
    "while there are likely other sources of scatter in the @xmath2@xmath1 relationship , such as inclination , variability , and conversion between @xmath15 and @xmath77 , differences in blr properties certainly contribute to this scatter and possibly dominate it . the fact that @xmath272 suggests that the magnitude of the dispersion in these properties is larger for the c iv emitting region .",
    "in addition , the regressions of @xcite are consistent with @xmath273 , similar to the result found here and by @xcite for c iv .",
    "it is worth comparing our estimates of @xmath49 based on single - epoch c iv to those based on combining single - epoch h@xmath10 with the @xmath274@xmath1 relationship . to do this",
    ", we took our sample of 100 sources that have data for both c iv and h@xmath10 and calculated estimates of @xmath49 from each .",
    "we compare the mass estimates obtained from both emission lines , and find that the two give mass estimates that are consistent so long as one uses the uv continuum to estimate the blr size .    for the h@xmath10 emission line",
    ", we estimate the blr size from both the optical and uv @xmath274@xmath1 relationships .",
    "the blr size , @xmath274 , is estimated as @xmath275 for @xmath276 and @xmath202 in the optical @xmath274@xmath1 relationship , we use the luminosity at @xmath228 and the average of the bces bisector and fitexy @xcite fits of @xcite , @xmath277 . for the uv @xmath274@xmath1 relationship",
    ", we use the luminosity at @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "we assume @xmath280 to allow more direct comparison with the c iv - based mass estimates , and because the fits of @xcite are consistent with this form . using the averaged values of @xmath2 for the balmer lines",
    "as listed by @xcite , we recalculated the @xmath2@xmath281 relationship for h@xmath10 with @xmath202 fixed at @xmath282 , and found @xmath283 .",
    "we then use @xmath274 with h@xmath10 @xmath8 to calculate @xmath284 from equation ( [ virial ] ) , after converting the h@xmath10 @xmath8 to a velocity dispersion assuming @xmath285 , based on the average @xmath286 from @xcite .    based on the results of ",
    "[ s - civrl ] , we calculate estimates of @xmath0 from the c iv line for these sources as @xmath287 . this form was found using the same method as described in ",

    "[ t - mbhest ] we report the broad line mass estimates based on the h@xmath10 and c iv lines for these sources , as well as a weighted average of the two .    in figure",
    "[ f - mhb_vs_mciv ] we show @xmath288 vs @xmath289 for both the optical and uv @xmath290@xmath1 relationship .",
    "we also show the @xmath291 ( @xmath292 ) confidence region for the parameters of a bces bisector fit to @xmath293 . as can be seen , the values of @xmath288 calculated using the uv @xmath290@xmath1 relationship are more consistent with the c iv - based ones .",
    "in addition , a pure 1:1 relationship falls outside of the @xmath291 confidence region on the bces bisector parameters for the optical - based @xmath288 values , but it is contained within the @xmath291 confidence region for the uv - based estimates .",
    "in fact , the bces bisector fit for the uv - based mass estimates differs from a 1:1 relationship at a significance level of only @xmath294 .",
    "our results are in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , who also compared the c iv- and h@xmath10-based mass estimates and found them to be consistent .    that the c iv- and h@xmath10-based mass estimates are consistent is in contrast to the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that c iv - based mass estimates may be problematic because they find that @xmath295 is significantly anti - correlated with @xmath296 .",
    "however this is expected even when @xmath297 , as an anti - correlation between the ratio of the line widths and the h@xmath10 @xmath8 is expected by construction ; i.e. , an anti - correlation between @xmath298 and @xmath299 is expected so long as the deviations of @xmath300 and @xmath296 from there respective means are not strongly correlated .",
    "in addition , none of the sources in the @xcite sample have h@xmath10 broader than c iv for @xmath301 .",
    "to a lesser extant , a similar effect is seen in figure 7 of @xcite and figure 4 of @xcite . in figure [ f - mhb_vs_mciv ]",
    "we compare the c iv and h@xmath10 @xmath8 for our sources .",
    "we find that most of the sources with @xmath302 tend to have broader c iv lines .",
    "while the line widths certainly do not have a 1:1 relationship , the bces bisector fit found that on average @xmath303 is approximately proportional to @xmath244 , @xmath304 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite did not perform a regression analysis , so we are unable to make a more quantitative comparison .",
    "if the line widths are set by the virial relationship , we would expect @xmath305 . while the divergence from @xmath305 is likely real ( @xmath306 significance ) , it is small , especially when compared with the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath8 plot .",
    "furthermore , this divergence from @xmath305 does not appear to have a significant effect on the c iv mass estimates , as the masses inferred from the two emission lines differ only at the level of @xmath294 .",
    "as can by seen from the plot in figure [ f - mhb_vs_mciv ] , any systematic difference between the c iv- and h@xmath10-based mass estimates is small compared to the statistical scatter in @xmath128 .",
    "@xcite performed a reanalysis of the @xcite sample and concluded that the poor correlation between the c iv @xmath8 and the h@xmath10 @xmath8 seen by @xcite was due to the inclusion of a large number of narrow line seyfert 1s ( nls1 ) and the subtraction of a c iv narrow component .",
    "@xcite noted that for these sources the c iv line profile is unlikely to be suitable for estimating @xmath0 , as there may be a strong component from an outflowing wind . upon removing the nls1s and the sources with poor iue data",
    ", @xcite found the correlation between c iv @xmath8 and h@xmath10 @xmath8 to be significantly better .",
    "in addition , @xcite compared the correlation of c iv @xmath174 with @xmath307 .",
    "a similar investigation was performed by @xcite , where they compared the metallicity indicator n v / c iv with @xmath308 .",
    "both authors found a stronger correlation when @xmath0 was estimated from the h@xmath10 line as compared to c iv , and suggested that the c iv line may give a less efficient and possibly biased estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "however , as noted in ",
    "[ s - corrprob ] , correlation coefficients inferred from the estimated black hole masses must be interpreted with caution . in particular ,",
    "the ses estimate of @xmath49 , @xmath128 , merely defines the centroid of the probability density of @xmath309 , and is in general _ not _ the actual @xmath49 for an object .",
    "therefore , this difference in the correlation coefficient between the h@xmath10- and c iv - based mass estimates may be just the result of random sampling , and it is unclear whether one can say that the correlation coefficients inferred from the two different mass estimates are inconsistent with those mass estimates being drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "the most direct test of the effectiveness of using c iv to estimate @xmath0 is found by comparing those values of @xmath128 estimated using c iv with the actual reverberation mapping values of @xmath49 .",
    "this was done in   [ s - civrl ] , where inclusion of the c iv @xmath8 resulted in a reduction of the error in @xmath128 of @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , figure [ f - photoresid ] compares the c iv - based estimate of @xmath49 with the reverberation mapping values .",
    "as can be seen , assuming @xmath310 is consistent with the reverberation mapping sample , and therefore there is no reason to assume that the c iv line gives a biased estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath255 does give a biased estimate of @xmath49 , then this bias is likely negligible compared to the variance in @xmath255 .",
    "in this work we have undertaken a statistical investigation of the best method to estimate smbh mass based on the single - epoch c iv line and agn continuum at @xmath183 .",
    "the main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "estimating agn black hole masses from a single - epoch spectrum is a considerably different problem than in the reverberation - mapping case .",
    "because of this , one is not estimating @xmath0 directly , but calculating a probability distribution of @xmath0 given the observed luminosity , line width , and redshift , @xmath311 .",
    "2 .   combining the information in @xmath1 from both an intrinsic @xmath0@xmath1 correlation and the @xmath2@xmath1 relationship results in improved black hole mass estimates .",
    "however , because of the current systematic uncertainties in the @xmath0@xmath1 relationship , estimates based on its inclusion should be viewed with caution .",
    "in addition , incorporating information from the intrinsic distribution of @xmath0 also results in more accurate estimates , on average .",
    "3 .   the distribution of @xmath0 inferred from the broad line mass estimates , @xmath107 , is broader than the intrinsic distribution of @xmath0 , as @xmath107 are estimates of @xmath49 contaminated by ` measurement error . ' in addition , it is necessary to estimate or assume @xmath50 in order to estimate a survey s completeness in @xmath0 .",
    "the best estimates of @xmath0 based on the c iv emission line are obtained using the uv continuum luminosity and @xmath8 .",
    "we find evidence that the c iv line shift , centroid , @xmath174 , and spectral slope of the uv continuum do not contribute any additional information to estimating @xmath0 for a given @xmath312 and @xmath244 .",
    "5 .   using the reverberation mapping sample",
    ", we find an @xmath0@xmath1 relationship of the form @xmath313 the intrinsic scatter about this relationship is @xmath314 dex .",
    "combining mass estimates based on this relationship with the broad line mass estimates results in a reduction in the statistical error of @xmath254 .",
    "we estimate a c iv @xmath2@xmath1 relationship of the form @xmath315 .",
    "this is consistent with an @xmath2@xmath1 relationship of the form @xmath17 predicted from simple photoionization physics or if the blr size is set by the dust sublimation radius .",
    "the scatter about the c iv @xmath2@xmath1 relationship inferred from the reverberation mapping estimates of @xmath0 is @xmath316 dex .",
    "7 .   a broad line estimate of @xmath49 based on the c iv emission line may be calculated as @xmath317 here , @xmath318 is in units of @xmath319 and @xmath8 is in units of @xmath320 .",
    "the correlation between regression coefficients is @xmath321 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in @xmath49 about equation ( [ mciv ] ) is @xmath322 dex .",
    "the c iv- and h@xmath10-based mass estimates are consistent if one assumes @xmath323 for both emission lines .",
    "the two emission lines give estimates of @xmath0 with comparable accuracy .",
    "we find evidence that the @xmath2@xmath1 relationships for c iv and h@xmath10 are similar in their dependence on @xmath324",
    ". for both , @xmath325 is consistent with the available data .",
    "also , the scatter in the c iv @xmath2@xmath1 relationship is a factor @xmath326 larger .",
    "this suggests that the c iv broad line region gas has a larger dispersion in its properties ( e.g. , density , ionization parameter , inclination ) than the h@xmath10 blr gas .",
