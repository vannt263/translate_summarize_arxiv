    "the code was recently improved @xcite with the prta ( partially resolved transition array ) model @xcite , which may replace the single feature of a uta by a small - scale detailed transition array that conserves the known transition - array properties ( energy and variance ) and yields improved higher - order moments . in the prta approach , open subshells",

    "the main group includes the active electrons and those electrons that couple strongly with the active ones .",
    "the other subshells are relegated to the secondary group .",
    "a small - scale dla calculation is performed for the main group ( assuming therefore that the subshells in the secondary group are closed ) and a statistical approach for the secondary group assigns the missing uta variance to the lines . in the case where the transition @xmath32 is a uta that can be replaced by a prta ( see fig .",
