    "this link between the neutron star lmxbs , their transient cousins , the x  ray transients , and the millisecond radio pulsars has been established by the discovery of the first accretion powered millisecond x  ray pulsar in 1998 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    subsequently , more of these systems have been found . at the time of writing",

    "these transients flare  up during episodes of enhanced mass accretion rate onto the neutron star .",
    "it is thought that during outburst the enhanced mass accretion rate suppresses the radio pulsar mechanism precluding the detection of pulsed radio emission .",
    "radio emission of these transients has been detected in outburst , but this is associated with synchrotron emission from a radio jet ( e.g.  sax  j1808.43658 , @xcite ; xte  j0929314 @xcite ; igr  j00921 + 5934 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when the mass accretion rate stops / becomes very low the radio pulsar mechanism should turn on . however , despite deep searches using sensitive radio telescopes at epochs when one of these transients , sax  j1808.43658 , was in quiescence no radio millisecond pulsations have been found ( @xcite ) .",

    "the absence of a double  humped morphology rules out that the modulation is due to ellipsoidal variations .",
    "proposed that the irradiation is caused by a turned  on radio pulsar instead of the quiescent x  ray emission .",
    "evidence for a turned  on radio pulsar , albeit indirect in this case ( see @xcite ) , would reinforce the link between the lmxbs and the millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "furthermore , a turned  on radio pulsar would have an important effect on the evolution of the mass  losing donor star , altering the evolutionary path of the binary ( @xcite ) .",

    "the lack of flaring together with the lower average brightness suggests that the source showed activity at the time of our optical observations above that found by @xcite .    in order to investigate the nature of the flares and the observed variability in the phase folded optical light curve , we compared the quiescent properties of  observed by us with those reported by torres et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and @xcite and with those reported for several other sources , most notably cen  x4 ( , @xcite ) . optical flares similar to those observed in  in quiescence",
    "have been reported for several sources ( e.g.  , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , flares as large as the largest that we observe in  have not been reported to our knowledge .",
    "in addition , we note that a variation of about half a magnitude in the average brightness similar to that mentioned above for  has been reported for cen  x4 , xte  j2123058 and the black hole x  ray transient a  062000 ( , @xcite , @xcite , respectively ) .    strong flares of similar duration ( tens of minutes ) have been observed in mid and late m dwarfs ( e.g.  see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the flares in quiescent lmxbs are associated with the accretion disk .",
    "indeed , the combination of strong flaring and the lack of clear ellipsiodal variations in the phase folded light curve ( this work as well as @xcite ) , imply that the quiescent light is not dominated by a roche lobe filling , but otherwise unperturbed donor star .",
    "if the flares are from the donor star their amplitude must be larger still . instead , ( superhumps from ) a residual accretion disk , the accretion stream , and/or effects from an irradiated donor star are potentially important contributors to the quiescent @xmath0band light .",
    "torres et al .  ( 2007 ) derive a similar conclusion on the basis of the quiescent intrinsic @xmath20 color and constraints on the donor star from the pulsar mass function .",
    "the absence of ellipsoidal variations in the phase folded light curves of both  as well as  is consistent with the very low contribution of a ( non  irradiated ) brown dwarf to the optical light .",
    "overall , the phase folded quiescent @xmath0band light curve of  that we find resembles that of the average quiescent @xmath21band light curve of cen  x4 observed by in 19841988 ( see their figure 7 ) .",
    "show that a model where a large fraction of the optical light comes from the heated hemi  sphere of the companion star or an accretion disk attenuated by electron scattering in an accretion wake can describe the data well .",
    "in particular such a model can explain the lower brightness at orbital phases 0.50.7 .",
    "the heating of the companion star in ms x  ray pulsars in quiescence has been ascribed to the turn  on of an active radio pulsar ( ) .",
    "such an effect might be underlaying the folded lightcurve of , however , due to the ( likely ) higher level of activity during our observations additional effects seem to be important .",
    "an important clue comes from the phase difference between the maximum of the sinusoidal modulation reported by @xcite and that reported in this work .",
    "this suggests the presence of a modulation that has a period unequal to the orbital period , such as a superhump .",
    "potentially , the overall morphology of our folded lightcurve can indeed be described by effects originating in a superhump .",
    "superhumps have been detected in the black hole candidate xte  j1118 + 480 while near quiescence ( @xcite ) . as explained in @xcite",
    ", superhumps can occur in systems when the ratio between the companion star and the compact object mass is @xmath2 0.3 .",
    "an accretion stream that perturbs the outer disk facilitates the excitation of tidal torques that are setting off the superhump resonance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hint for a brightening of the source around phase 0.9 visible in figure  [ fold ] can be explained by the presence of an accretion stream and hot  spot while the mass ratio is very likely ( much ) lower than 0.3 .",
    "however , from studies of cataclysmic variables it is known that the superhump only develops during outburst , most likely since the mass and hence angular momentum transfer rate through the disk in quiescence is too low to allow for a large extent of the disk . hence",
    ", it is not clear whether all the conditions necessary for the occurrence of superhumps are fullfilled in  during our observations .",
    "interestingly , @xcite also found evidence for the presence of an eccentric , precessing disk in the black hole candidate a  0620 - 000 in quiescence .",
    "as superhumps can potentially explain the overall variability observed in the optical in several systems while in quiescence , further investigation is necessary to test whether during phases of ( enhanced ) mass transfer in quiescence a superhump can develop in quiescent lmxbs with mass ratios less than 0.3 .",
