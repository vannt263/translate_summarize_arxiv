    "heterosystems with adjacent superconducting and ferromagnetic phases may show unconventional spin - triplet superconducting proximity effects even if the superconductor is of the conventional @xmath0-wave spin - singlet type.@xcite triplet correlations , even if they are weak , are important in ferromagnets , where the standard spin - singlet proximity effect is short - ranged as a result of the exchange splitting.@xcite in half - metals singlet pairings are ruled out , since in a half metal one spin species has zero density of states at the fermi level , so that the triplet version is the only possible form of the superconducting proximity effect .",
    "microscopically , the superconducting proximity effect is mediated by andreev reflection , the phase - coherent reflection of an electron into a hole or vice versa at the superconductor interface.@xcite triplet superconducting correlations then require a form of andreev reflection that includes a spin flip.@xcite    the triplet proximity effect has been considered first in ferromagnets ( with a finite minority spin population ) , where the observation of long - range superconducting correlation effects@xcite has been shown to be consistent with the existence of induced triplet correlations in the ferromagnet.@xcite a number of mechanisms that give rise to the spin - flip andreev reflection required for the triplet correlations , such as magnetic domain walls,@xcite spin - orbit interaction,@xcite and unconventional pairing correlations,@xcite have been studied in hybrid ferromagnet - superconductor systems .",
    "a +     +    b +    long - range proximity effects have also been observed in half - metallic @xmath1nbtin@xcite and @xmath1moge@xcite heterostructures .",
    "because of the absence of minority carriers in the half metal it is concluded that the observed superconducting correlations must be of triplet type.@xcite however , in half metals the conditions for spin - flip andreev reflection are more restrictive than in a ferromagnet . in particular , electron - hole symmetry and current conservation pose stronger restrictions on candidate mechanisms for spin - flip andreev reflections than in ferromagnets:@xcite if the interface is symmetric with respect to reflection in the surface normal , electron - hole symmetry and unitarity require the andreev reflection amplitude @xmath2 to vanish at the fermi energy @xmath3.@xcite thus , mechanisms that give rise to triplet andreev reflection must either break electron - hole symmetry , _ i.e. _ take place away from the fermi energy , or orbital symmetries",
    ". mechanisms of the latter type are magnetization gradients in the half metal,@xcite or impurity scattering.@xcite    in this article , we study spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in s as a possible mechanism giving rise to spin - flip andreev reflection in a half metal ( h ) .",
    "the presence of soi is contingent on the breaking of inversion symmetry .",
    "examples for systems with soi in the normal state are surface states in au,@xcite semiconductor heterostructures and 2d electron gases in quantum wells with partially tunable sois.@xcite crystalline superconductors such as the non - centrosymmetric cuprates and heavy - fermion compounds such as @xmath4@xcite and others,@xcite show soi due to the absence of an inversion center in their crystal structure .",
    "these materials have received intense interest because they display unconventional superconducting ( helical@xcite ) phases with mixed singlet and triplet pairing correlations,@xcite magnetoelectric effects,@xcite and an anisotropic spin susceptibility.@xcite but also centrosymmetric superconducting materials show soi in surface or interfacial layers with inversion asymmetry .",
    "for instance , the breaking of inversion symmetry at a plane interface due to a change in the chemical potential gives rise to the rashba soi.@xcite    in our calculation we assume a general model for the soi that is linear in momentum and includes the rashba soi as a special case .",
    "in the first part of this article , we derive expressions for the electron - to - hole and hole - to - electron andreev reflection amplitudes @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a model hamiltonian with parabolic dispersion in the half metal and in ( the normal state of ) the superconductor and to first order in the soi . for our model hamiltonian , which includes effects of a fermi - velocity mismatch and a tunnel barrier at the half - metal  superconductor interface , we find that the andreev reflection is such that the induced superconducting correlations in the vicinity of the superconducting interface are of even - frequency and complex @xmath7-wave type .",
    "this is a significant difference with other possible sources of triplet superconducting correlations in half metals , such as a nonuniform magnetization direction in the half metal , which also allow for odd - frequency @xmath0-wave proximity effects .",
    "because andreev reflection relies on the presence of soi in the superconductor , the andreev reflection probability @xmath8 may be small depending on the strength of the soi such that the induced superconducting correlations become weak .",
    "however , a fully developed proximity effect@xcite can be achieved in a geometry in which multiple andreev reflections occur .",
    "examples of such geometries are a half - metallic film or wire in contact to a superconductor ( shown schematically in fig .",

    "we will show that the effect of multiple andreev reflections can be combined into effective andreev reflection amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these effective amplitudes may have unit magnitude if sufficient reflection events contribute coherently them .",
    "we show that in this case localized majorana states can be formed at the ends of a half metal wire in contact to a superconductor with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the investigation of the thin - film geometry is motivated by the recent experiments of refs .  .",
    "in the present calculation we do not consider scattering from impurities in hor s. this does not seriously affect the first part of our calculation , which addresses the andreev reflection amplitude for a single reflection off the hs interface , because the andreev reflection amplitude is a local property of the interface .",
    "it is , however , a limitation for the second part of our calculation , since the proximity effect induced by the multiple andreev reflections is of @xmath7-wave type , which is suppressed by impurity scattering .",
