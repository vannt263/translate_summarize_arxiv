    "we will investigate one such class , those with convolution equivalent lvy measure .",

    "the behavior of @xmath42 has been investigated under various conditions on @xmath43 , for example , when @xmath44 is regularly varying ( see berman  @xcite and marcus  @xcite ) , and more generally when @xmath44 is subexponential ( see rosiski and samordnitsky  @xcite ) . in the case of interest in this paper ,",
    "when @xmath5 is convolution equivalent , braverman and samordnitsky  @xcite proved that the limit in ( [ rat ] ) exists but were unable to identify its value .",
