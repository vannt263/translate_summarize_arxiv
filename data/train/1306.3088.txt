    "a cycle cover of a graph @xmath6 is a collection of cycles @xmath7 such that every edge edge of @xmath6 belongs to at least one cycle of @xmath7 .",
    "cycle covers are well studied objects , see @xcite for surveys , and in particular the length , i.e the sum of the lengths of the cycles in the cover , has received much attention .",
    "we let @xmath8 denote the length of the shortest cycle cover of @xmath6 . in @xcite alon and tarsi made the following conjecture    @xcite if @xmath6 is a cubic 2-edge connect graph then @xmath9 , where m is the number of edges in @xmath6    [ c : at ] if @xmath6 is 3-edge - colorable it is easy to see that the conjecture is true , and in fact @xmath10 , since we can use the cycle cover given by taking two pairs of edge colours . this particular covering will also be a @xmath5-covering , ie .",
    "every edge lies in either 1 or 2 cycles , and it can be extended to a cycle double covering , where every edge belongs to exactly 2 cycles",
    ".    in @xcite kostochka proved that if conjecture [ c : at ] is true then it also holds with the added condition that the covering must be a @xmath5-covering , and zhang @xcite conjectured that for any 3-edge - connected cubic graph there is a shortest cycle cover which is a @xmath5-cover .",
    "conjecture [ c : at ] remains open , it is known from @xcite that for both 2-edge and 3-edge - connected graphs the constant @xmath11 would be optimal , and the best current bound is @xmath12 , @xcite .    in @xcite all snarks ( cyclically 4-edge connected , not 3 edge - colourable cubic graphs ) on @xmath13 vertices were generated and , among other things , the value of @xmath8 was computed .",
    "it turns out that in this collection of graphs only two have @xmath14 , the examples are the petersen graph and a particular snark with 34 vertices , while all other have @xmath10 , and the authors made the following conjecture .",
    "@xcite[c : s ] if @xmath6 is a snark then @xmath15    for the class of cyclically 4-edge - connected graph this conjecture gives a significant strengthening of conjecture [ c : at ] . in @xcite a snark with @xmath16 was constructed ..    apart from the computational results of @xcite we also know that conjecture [ c : s ] holds for snark families where the girth grows with @xmath17 , since jackson @xcite proved that @xmath18 for 2-edge - connected cubic graphs of girth @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "additional conditions for having short cycle covers with different structural properties were given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will show that conjecture [ c : s ] is true for several classical families of snarks by relating short cycle covers to the perfect matching index of a cubic graph , see section [ pm ] , where we also show that graphs with low perfect matching index satisfy zhang s conjecture",
    ". we will also prove that for graphs with long cycles , of length at least @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 , and that graphs of oddness 2 have short cycle covers if they have small 2-factors . most of our results a proven by showing that the graphs at hand have cycle double covers which contain 2-regular subgraphs which are close to a 2-factor in size .",
    "finally we discuss some open problems motivated by our current investigation , look at the connection to jaeger s petersen - colouring conjecture , and point out a perhaps unexpected rigidity in the structure of shortest covers of some snarks and graphs of low connectivity .",
    "our proofs will make use of the following simple observations , neither of which are new and have been observed on different occasions by several other authors .",
    "[ lem1 ] if a cubic graph @xmath6 has a 2-regular subgraph @xmath24 and a cdc @xmath25 such that @xmath26 then @xmath6 has a @xmath5-cycle cover of length @xmath27    typically we will be interested in cycle covers with length close to the shortest possible value @xmath4 and for the very shortest cases we can reverse the conclusion of the preceding lemma .",
    "[ lem2 ] if @xmath6 has a cycle cover @xmath7 of length @xmath28 , where @xmath29 then the edges of weight 1 form a 2-regular subgraph @xmath24 of length @xmath21 such that @xmath30 is a cycle double cover of @xmath6    given a cycle covering @xmath7 we define the weight of an edge @xmath31 to be the number of cycles from @xmath7 which contain @xmath31 , and the weight @xmath32 of a vertex @xmath33 to be the sum of the weights of the edges incident to @xmath33 . the length of @xmath7 is then given by @xmath34 .",
    "the lowest possible weight of a vertex is 4 , which happens if the incident edges have weights 1,1 and 2 .",
    "we now note that in a covering of these lengths all edges must have weight 1 or 2 , since @xmath35 if there exists at least one edge of weight 3 .",
    "next we note that the edges of weight 1 must form a 2-regular subgraph @xmath24 of @xmath6 with length @xmath21 , and c together with @xmath7 form a cycle double cover of @xmath6",
    "in @xcite goddyn posed what is now known as the strong cycle double cover conjecture : given a cycle @xmath24 in a 2-connected cubic graph there is a cycle double cover of @xmath6 which contains @xmath24 . in @xcite this conjecture was verified for snarks on first 32 and then @xmath13 vertices . in @xcite",
    "this result was used in order to prove that if the circumference @xmath36 of @xmath6 , ie the length of the longest cycle in @xmath6 , is close enough to @xmath17 then @xmath6 has a cdc . by following the method of that proof we can also prove that graph with large circumference have short cycle covers .",
    "there is a function @xmath37 such that if the strong cycle double cover conjecture is true for cubic graphs with at most @xmath38 vertices then for @xmath6 such that @xmath39 we have @xmath40 and in general @xmath41 .",

    "each pair of colours define a 2-regular graph and those three graphs form a cdc @xmath46 of @xmath45 which contains the cycle corresponding to @xmath24 .",

    "it was verified that the strong cycle double cover conjecture holds for @xmath13 , so @xmath37 exists for @xmath22 .",
    "recall that the _ oddness _ @xmath55 of a cubic graph @xmath6 is the minimum number of odd cycles in any 2-factor of @xmath6 .",
    "graphs with oddness 0 are 3-edge - colourable and graphs with oddness 2 and 4 are known to have cycle double covers @xcite and also behave well with respect to other cycle cover / decomposition properties @xcite .    for some graphs of oddness 2 we can show an optimal bound on the length of the shortest cycle cover .",
    "if @xmath6 is cyclically 4-edge - connected and has a 2-factor with exactly two components then @xmath56 .",
    "if there are three consecutive vertices on one the two cycles in the 2-factor with neighbours on the other cycle then @xmath57 .",
    "there are graphs of this type with @xmath14 , e.g the petersen graph , so the bound in the theorem is at most 1 away from being sharp .",
    "the second case of the theorem will for example apply if one of the two cycles is an induced cycle in @xmath6 , as in the petersen graph .",
    "let @xmath58 be a 2-factor with exactly two components and let @xmath59 be three edges with endpoints on both @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the cubic graph which is homeomorphic to the graph given by @xmath62 .",
    "now @xmath42 has a 2-factor consisting of two even cycles @xmath63 and @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and so has a 3-edge - colouring with colours 1 and 2 on the edges of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and colour 3 on the perfect matching @xmath65 given by @xmath66 .",
    "we may assume that at least two of the three edges on which the endpoints of @xmath67 were in @xmath60 have colour 1 , if necessary by switching the colour 1 and 2 on @xmath63 , and likewise on @xmath64 .",
    "the colouring now gives a cycle double covering of @xmath68 , by the cycles given by each pair of the three colours , and a corresponding cycle double covering @xmath44 of @xmath62 such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "similarly @xmath71 together with @xmath67 gives a graph with a cdc @xmath46 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "now @xmath74 is a cdc of @xmath6 which includes the cycles given by the colours @xmath75 in @xmath42 , and by our choice of colouring the length of this 2-regular subgraph is at least @xmath76 , so by lemma [ lem1 ] we have @xmath77    if the second case of the theorem applies then we can choose the colouring of the cycle in the condition such that all three of those edge endpoints lie on an edge of colour 1 , thereby missing at most one vertex on the other cycle .",
    "it is possible to generalize the preceding proof to the situation where the 2-factor has some even components as well , but the bound becomes weaker .",
    "if @xmath6 is cyclically 4-edge - connected and has a 2-factor @xmath78 with exactly two odd components @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the total number of edges in the three shortest disjoint paths from @xmath60 to @xmath61 in the multigraph obtained by contracting each cycle in @xmath78 to a vertex is @xmath79 , then @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be the two odd cycles in @xmath78 . by menger s theorem we can find three disjoint paths @xmath81 from @xmath60 to @xmath61 in @xmath6 .",
    "we can now proceed as in the previous proof but using the three paths instead of the edges @xmath82 . since some cycles in @xmath78 can intersect more than one of the three paths @xmath83 we can not necessarily use the colouring modification used in the previous proof and so each edge of the three paths may contribute 2 edges which are not included in the ( 1,3)-coloured subgraph , thus adding @xmath84 to the length of the covering .",
    "it is possible to make the bound for @xmath85 somewhat stronger but since the method does not seem likely to give a sharp result , and quickly becomes lengthy , we have not included that analysis here .",
    "the perfect matching index @xmath86 of a bridgeless cubic graph is the smallest integer @xmath87 such that there exists perfect matchings @xmath88 such that @xmath89    note that @xmath6 is 3-edge - colourable if and only if @xmath90 . if fulkerson s conjecture @xcite is true then @xmath91 for all bridgeless cubic graphs @xmath6 .",
    "the perfect matching index was studied in more detail in @xcite , where its value for several families of snarks were determined , and in @xcite it was shown that all but two of the snarks with @xmath13 vertices have @xmath92 .    [ simpleprop ]",
    "let @xmath93 be two perfect matchings in a cubic graph @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath94 induces a subgraph @xmath95 of @xmath6 which consists of disjoint even cycles .    since every vertex of @xmath95 either has degree @xmath96 or it has degree 2 and one edge belongs to @xmath97 and the other to @xmath98 the result follows",
    "let @xmath6 be a cubic graph .",
    "then @xmath6 has a 5-cdc where one colour class is a 2-factor if and only if @xmath99 .",
    "[ tauthm ]    if @xmath90 then @xmath6 is 3-edge - colourable and the cdc given by the three pairs of edge colour classes is a 3-cdc in which each colour pair define a 2-factor .",
    "if @xmath92 then we let @xmath100 be a set of four perfect matchings such that @xmath101 . by the pigeonhole principle ,",
    "each vertex is incident to exactly one edge which is covered twice by the perfect matchings in @xmath102 .",
    "therefore the set of edges covered by exactly two perfect matchings is a perfect matching which we denote by @xmath65 . now consider @xmath103 . by proposition [ simpleprop",
    "] @xmath104 is a set of even subgraphs . if @xmath105 then @xmath31 is covered twice by @xmath104 and if @xmath106 then it is covered exactly once by @xmath104 .",
    "hence @xmath107 is a 5-cdc of @xmath6 in which one colour class is a 2-factor .",
    "conversely assume that @xmath6 has a 5-cdc @xmath108 where @xmath78 is a 2-factor of @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath109 is a perfect matching for @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath111 then e is covered by exactly one perfect matching in @xmath102 and if @xmath112 it is covered by exactly two elements of @xmath102 . hence @xmath102 is a perfect matching cover of @xmath6 with four perfect matchings .    in combination with our earlier results",
    "this shows that graphs with @xmath113 has cycle covers of the shortest possible length .",
    "[ th : tau ] if @xmath113 then @xmath114    by theorem [ tauthm ] @xmath6 has a cdc which contains a 2-factor and then the theorem follows by lemma [ lem1 ] .",
    "theorem [ th : tau ] was implicitly present already in the phd thesis of celmins @xcite , with a different proof and terminology , but as far as we have been able to determine he did not publish it . that a low perfect matching index implies the existence of a 5-cdc , and thereby a short cycle cover ,",
    "was recently also shown by steffen in @xcite .    by this theorem",
    "the snarks in several of the classical snark families have short cycle covers .",
    "we refer to e.g @xcite for the full definition of these snarks families .",
    "the flower snarks , goldberg snarks , and permutation snarks which are not the petersen graph have @xmath10    in @xcite it was proven the snarks in each of these families have @xmath92 .    as a corollary",
    "we also get a partial result on the conjecture of zhang @xcite mentioned in the introduction , as already pointed out by steffen @xcite .",
    "if @xmath113 then the shortest cycle cover of @xmath6 is a @xmath5-cover .",
    "finally we note that the situation for cubic graphs of cyclic edge - connectivity exactly 2 , or 3 , is not as simple as one might hope . as before we only need to consider graphs which can not be three - edge - coloured , so the only difference from the snark case is the cyclic connectivity .",
    "there are standard reductions for cutting a cubic graph into two smaller graphs @xmath115 and @xmath115 at a 2-edge or 3-edge cut , adding in extra edges and/or a vertices to make the component graphs cubic .",
    "ideally one could hope that a shortest covering of @xmath6 could be built from shortest coverings of @xmath116 and @xmath115 .",
    "however this is not always the case . in order for this composition construction to work one",
    "would need to know that for any edge @xmath31 in @xmath116 or @xmath115 there is a shortest cover where @xmath31 has a specified weight , in order to make sure that the cycle covers agree when we compose the two smaller graphs to form @xmath6 .",
    "this is true for 3-edge - colourable cubic graphs , and the petersen graph , but it is not true for one of the two snarks on 18 vertices which has an edge with only one possible weight in all shortest coverings .    in every 2-factor of the snark @xmath117 , shown in the left part of figure [ fig : sn18 ] , which can be extended to a cycle double covering",
    "there is a cycle which includes the edge @xmath118 .",
    "hence the edge @xmath118 has weight 1 in every shortest cycle cover of @xmath117 .",
    "the observation can be proven by either a case analysis or a direct computer search .",
    "[ fig : sn18 ]      using this observation we can easily construct graphs where each component coming from a 2-edge cut has shortest cycle cover of length @xmath119 , while the original graph does not .    [ ex1 ] delete the edge @xmath118 from three copies of the snark @xmath117 and then join them up to four additional vertices as shown on the right in figure [ fig : sn18 ] , where the dark circles are the copies of @xmath117 , to form a new graph @xmath120 .",
    "if we cut away the bottom copy of @xmath117 , and add the edge @xmath118 to this copy and the edge @xmath121 , from this graph we are left with one large cubic graph @xmath122 which has a 2-factor which corresponds to a 2-factor in each of the copies of @xmath117 which includes the deleted edge @xmath118 , and so has a cycle cover of length @xmath123 .",
    "however each such cycle cover gives weight 2 to the edge @xmath121 , which corresponds to the 2-edge cut used to separate the third copy of @xmath117 , and so can not be composed with a shortest cycle cover of @xmath117 .",
    "hence @xmath124    in @xcite it was proven that the perfect matching index of a graph @xmath6 with a 2-edge cut is always at least the maximum of the perfect matching index of the two graphs obtained by cutting @xmath6 at a 2-edge cut . from theorem [ th : tau ] and example [ ex1 ]",
    "it follows that the perfect matching index of a graph can be strictly greater than that of components coming from a 2-edge cut .",
    "a we have seen snarks with @xmath8 larger than @xmath4 are rare among the small snarks , and the classical snark families , however we expect the minimum to increase for larger snarks .            in @xcite jaeger made conjecture with far reaching consequences for the structure of cubic graphs .",
    "a _ petersen_-colouring of a cubic graph @xmath6 is a map @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the petersen graph , such that if @xmath67 are incident edges in @xmath6 then @xmath132 are incident edges in @xmath131 .",
    "jaeger conjectured that all 2-connected cubic graphs have a petersen - colouring .",
    "this is trivially true for 3-edge - colourable graphs and in @xcite the conjecture was verified for all snarks on @xmath13 vertices .    given a petersen - coloring @xmath1 of @xmath6 and a cycle cover @xmath7 of @xmath131 we can construct a cycle cover of @xmath6 by taking the inverse image under @xmath1 of each cycle in the cover . each edge in @xmath131 makes a contribution to the length of @xmath133 which is equal to its weight in @xmath7 times the number of edges mapped onto it by @xmath1 .",
    "using this observation , and saying that @xmath1 is balanced if the same number of edges in @xmath6 is mapped onto every edge in @xmath131 , we have :      the reason for the latter point is that if the colouring is unbalanced we can always find a 9-cycle in @xmath131 to which more than the average number edges is mapped and use that as the cycle which is covered only once in the shortest cover of @xmath131 .",
