    "roughly speaking , a random process is said to have long - memory if it has an autocorrelation function that is not integrable .",
    "this happens , for example , when the autocorrelation function decays asymptotically as a power law of the form @xmath0 with @xmath3 .",
    "this is important because it implies that values from the distant past can have a significant effect on the present , and implies anomalous diffusion in a stochastic process whose increments have long - memory .",
    "we present a more technical discussion of long - memory processes in section [ longmem ] .    in this paper",
    "we make use of a data set from the london stock exchange ( lse ) , which contains a full record of individual orders and cancellations , to show that stocks in the lse display a remarkable long - memory property .",
    "we label each event as either a buy or a sell order , and assign it @xmath4 accordingly .",
    "the autocorrelation of the resulting time series shows a power law autocorrelation function , with exponents that are typically about @xmath5 , in the range @xmath6 .",
    "positive autocorrelation coefficients are seen at statistically significant levels over lags of many thousand events , spanning many days .",
    "thus the memory of the market is remarkably long .",
    "this immediately raises a conundrum concerning market efficiency .",
    "all other things being equal , such strong long - memory behavior would imply strong predictability of the price return , easily exploitable for substantial profits",
    ". how can this be compatible with market efficiency ?",
    "we show that this is at least partially solved by other properties of the market adjusting in order to compensate , making the market more efficient . ] .",
    "in particular , the relative volume of buy and sell market orders , and the relative buy and sell liquidity , are skewed in opposition to the imbalance in order signs .",
    "for example , suppose the long - memory of previous order signs predicts that buy market orders are more likely in the near future .",
    "all things being equal , since buy market orders have a positive price response , the price should go up .",
    "but the market compensates for this : when buy orders become more likely , the ratio of buy market order size to the volume at the best ask tends to be smaller than normal .",
    "this implies that the probability of a given buy order penetrating the best price to trigger a positive price change is smaller than normal .",
    "similarly , the opposite is true when sell orders are more likely .",
    "this is at least one of the effects that contributes to keeping the price returns roughly white . we demonstrate that market order volume and liquidity are also long - memory processes",
    "; we suggest this is because they are compensating for changes in the predictability of order signs in order to keep the market more efficient .",
    "this brings up the interesting question of what actually causes these long - memory properties of markets .",
    "while not answering this question , we provide a clue about the answer by making use of the institutional codes associated with each order .",
    "some institutions show long - memory quite clearly , while others do not .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ review ] we present a brief summary of previous work on long - memory processes in economics , and discuss our work in the context of this literature . in section  [ data ]",
    "we give a summary of the data set , and in section  [ longmem ] we provide a more technical discussion of long - memory processes and the statistical techniques we use in this paper .",
    "then in section  [ statresults ] we present the evidence that sequences of order signs are long - memory processes , and in particular we demonstrate that these series pass stringent tests so that we can be sure that they are long - memory with a high degree of confidence . in section  [ efficiency ]",
    "we show how other processes compensate for the long - memory of order signs , tending to keep price changes roughly efficient , and show that both order size and liquidity are also long - memory processes . in section  [ investors ]",
    "we break down the orders by institution and show that the behavior of some institutions shows long - memory quite clearly , while others do not show it at all . in section  [ implications ] we discuss the implications of the long - memory properties of order flow for delayed market impact .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] , discussing some of the broader issues and the remaining questions .",
    "long - memory processes have been observed in different natural and human phenomena ranging from the level of rivers to the temperature of the earth ( beran , 1994 ) . a good survey of the econometric approach to long - memory is given in baillie ( 1996 ) .",
    "the range of applications of long - memory processes in economics spans from macroeconomics to finance . in macroeconomics , for example",
    ", diebold and rudebusch ( 1989 ) find evidence of long - memory in the quarterly post world war ii us real gnp data .",
    "even if several criticisms have been raised to this work , subsequent analyses confirm the evidence of long - memory properties of gnp data .",
    "baillie , chung and tieslau ( 1995 ) find that the monthly us consumer price index ( cpi ) inflation time series has long - memory properties .",
    "a related study by hassler and wolters ( 1995 ) considers long - memory in inflation .",
    "finally , shea ( 1991 ) and backus and zin ( 1993 ) find evidence of long - memory in the context of the term structure of interest rates .",
    "the study of possible long - memory properties of time series in finance is even more widespread .",
    "there has been a long - standing debate as to whether or not asset prices have long - memory properties .",
    "several authors have claimed that the time series of stock returns for stock prices or indices display long - memory ( mandelbrot , 1971 , greene and fielitz , 1977 ) .",
    "more recently lo ( 1991 ) re - examined these results and showed that the statistical r / s test used by mandelbrot and green and fielitz is too weak and unable to distinguish between long and short memory ( see also section  [ longmem ] and campbell et al .",
    "1997 ) ) . by introducing a modified r",
    "/ s test , lo concluded that daily stock returns do not display long - memory properties .",
    "this conclusion has been in turn criticized by willinger , taqqu and teverovsky ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors showed with numerical simulations that the modified r / s test leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis of short - memory when applied to synthetic time series with a low degree of long - memory .",
    "since financial data tipically display low degree of long - memory , willinger , taqqu and teverovsky ( 1999 ) claim that the result of lo is not conclusive .",
    "( we will not address this question ) .",
    "it is more widely accepted ( though still not entirely uncontroversial ) that the volatility of prices is a long - memory process .",
    "specifically ding , granger and engle ( 1993 ) and breidt , crato and de lima ( 1993 ) find evidence of long - memory stochastic volatility in stock returns , and harvey ( 1993 ) finds evidence for this in exchange rates .",
    "these results led to the development of alternate models for volatility , such as figarch .",
    "in particular , baillie , bollerslev and mikkelsen ( 1996 ) apply the figarch process to exchange rates , and bollerslev and mikkelsen ( 1996 ) apply fiegarch , a modification of figarch , to stock prices .",
    "another market property that seems to have long - memory properties is stock market trading volume ( lobato and velasco , 2000 ) .",
    "models of long - memory processes include fractional brownian noise ( mandelbrot and van ness , 1968 ) and the arfima process introduced by granger and joyeux ( 1980 ) and hosking ( 1981 ) .",
    "in this paper we discover and study the long - memory properties of the signs of orders in a financial market . despite the ubiquity of long - memory processes in economic time series described above",
    ", our result is , to our knowledge , the first demonstration of the presence of long - memory in a  microscopic \" time series , i.e. a time series which is not the result of the aggregation of many individual events ( such as the price return ) .",
    "because of the rapid timescale , we have a large amount of data , and we are able to demonstrate the existence of long - memory properties with a very high degree of confidence .",
    "the order flow is a time series describing the action of trading institutions , i.e. it is an input to the price formation mechanism . from this point of view",
    "it is very interesting to see how the market responds to the existence of a highly predictable long - memory input , to form prices so as to maintain market efficiency .",
    "because we are able to see the detailed state of the orderbook , we can study how bids , offers , and order volumes adjust to compensate , so that the long - memory properties of order signs and volumes are cancelled in the directional movements of prices .",
    "we investigate the order flow mainly in event time .",
    "this means that one time step is defined by the placement of an order of a given type ( market order , limit order and cancellation ) . as a consequence",
    "the long - memory property we discuss here is not the effect of inhomogeneous trading during the day , but rather reflects the strategic way in which traders place their orders .",
    "finally , we prove with statistical confidence that the long - memory property of the sign of the order flow can be present also at the level of individual trading institution .",

    "in this section we discuss a practical consequence of long - memory of order flow .",
    "we have seen in section v.a that the market impact is a concave function of volume .",
    "we may therefore ask about the price shift in the future ( in transaction time ) given that an order of a given volume and sign has arrived in the present . to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider a buy market order of volume @xmath17 occurring now .",
    "the generated price shift @xmath30 is the difference between the midprice just after the order and just before the order . between this market order and the next market order",

    "a new midprice shift @xmath32 occurs .",
    "the total price shift between the instant just before the first order is placed and the instant just after the second market order is placed is therefore @xmath33 if the order flow were random we would expect that @xmath34 since the volume and the sign of the next orders is uncorrelated with the corresponding quantities of the first order . in figure  [ delayimpact ]",
    "we present a decomposition of the impact of two successive market orders in the terms described above . in panel",
    "( a ) of figure [ delayimpact ] we show the four quantities @xmath18 ( the same quantity shown in fig .",
    "[ impact ] ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we see that @xmath19 is almost zero , meaning that the price shift due to limit orders and cancellations after a market order is relatively unimportant .",
    "this result suggests that the role of price reversion due to limit orders and cancellations between two market orders is marginal in making the market efficient . on the other hand @xmath20",
    "is clearly positive and increasing with @xmath17 .",
    "this is due to the strong temporal correlation in market order sign and size .",
    "in fact if the first market order is a buy market order it is probable that the next market order is also a buy and the volume of the second market order is correlated with the first one . therefore it is more probable that the price will move up due to the arrival of the second order .",
    "figure  [ delayimpact ] shows @xmath21 , which is simply the sum of the three terms , as shown in eq .",
    "[ decomposedimpact ] .",
    "the distance between @xmath21 and @xmath18 is a measure of the effect of the correlation of order sign and size in the delayed price impact .    to extend this analysis to more orders , we study the delayed market impact @xmath22 where @xmath35 is the number of future market orders .",
    "panel ( b ) of figure [ delayimpact ] shows this quantity as a function of @xmath17 for @xmath36 and @xmath29 .",
    "we see that for a fixed value of @xmath17 , @xmath22 is an increasing function of @xmath35 .",
    "this is clearly due to the long correlation of market order sign and size .",
    "eventually , for large values of @xmath35 , @xmath22 becomes independent of @xmath35 .",
    "now that we have presented all our results , we can compare to the work of bouchaud et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "they independently discovered the same long - memory effect we have reported here for market order flow in the paris stock exchange .",
    "we have taken the analysis in a somewhat different direction than they have , and offered a different interpretation .",
    "first , to convince potential sceptics , we have gone to extensive length to demonstrate at a very high level of statistical significance that order signs are indeed a long - memory process .",
    "this is separately true for market orders , limit orders , and cancellations .",
    "we have explicitly constructed a time series forecasting model that shows the high degree of predictability that goes along with this behavior  the conditional probability of the sign of the next order is frequently as high as @xmath37 . as required to ensure market efficiency ,",
    "this predictability is not present in price movements .",
    "we have hypothesized that this is at least in part due to anti - correlated changes in relative liquidity , as defined by the ratio of market order size to volume at the best opposite price .",
    "this is large effect , involving variations in relative liquidity of the order of @xmath38 .",
    "this does not prove that this is sufficient to ensure efficiency , but it does suggest that time varying relative liquidity plays a major role .",
    "bouchaud et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have offered a different explanation .",
    "the key difference concerns the way in which liquidity is treated .",
    "they assume a constant mean - reverting propagator for market impact .",
    "whereas we have studied the way in which liquidity varies in opposition to order flow , their assumption of a constant propagator amounts to assuming that the liquidity is not varying in any correlated manner with trends in order flow .",
    "instead , they assume that the market impact is time dependent in a way tha causes much of it to disappear .",
    "they have pointed out that the market impact does not grow as fast as one would naively expect , and have presented evidence that it often reverts on a long timescale , corresonding to a few hours to a day .",
    "they propose that the key factor ensuring efficiency is anti - correlated limit order placement , i.e. that later placement of limit orders undoes the potentially long - memory permanent price changes that would otherwise be caused by market orders .    we have presented two pieces of evidence that seem to oppose this point of view : first , we show that market order , limit order , and cancellation driven price changes are not long - memory , even when they are considered individually .",
    "this seems to imply that correlated behavior of limit orders is not the effect that cancels the long - memory of order flow .",
    "second , in our study of market impact in section  [ implications ] , we showed that the expected price shift in the intervening time between two market orders due to limit orders and cancellations is relatively small .",
    "it may still be possible , however , that these small effects accumulate to become important , as suggested by bouchaud et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    at this stage",
    "it is quite possible that both of these effects coexist : while we have showed that time - varying liquidity is a significant effect , we have not presented any evidence that it is the only effect .",
    "it may well be that there are diverse forces working to ensure market efficiency .",
    "we have shown that the sign of order flow , order size , and liquidity , are all long - memory processes .",
    "what might cause this ? in this section",
    "we make a few speculations about the possible origin of long - memory in these fundamental inputs to price formation .",
    "one possible explanation for long - memory in order flow is that it simply reflects news arrival .",
    "good ( or bad ) news may be clustered in time , driving the sign of order flow .",
    "such news could either be external to the market , or it could be generated by factors internal to the market . if external it could be a property of the natural world , a reflection of the environment that humans necessarily interact with .",
    "we know that the intensity of floods , hurricanes , earthquakes , and natural disasters have a power law distribution , and perhaps these are just symptoms of a ubiquitous property of the natural world that is reflected in what we consider  news \" .",
    "alternatively , this could be an internal property , due to human social dynamics .",
    "such  news \" might be internally generated , e.g. due to herding behavior ( cont and bouchaud , 2000 ) , or it might be caused by inattention : time lags in the response of investors to news arrival can cause autocorrelations in order flow . however , it is not clear why this should have a power law distribution .",
    "a different explanation is in terms of the execution of large orders , which leads to order splitting .",
    "it is well - known that institutions with large orders frequently split them into small pieces ( chan and lakonishok , 1993 and 1995 ) , spreading out the execution of the orders over periods that can be many months long .",
    "if such orders have a power law distribution , and the time needed to fully execute an order is proportional to the size of the order , then this might give rise to power law autocorrelations in time . the idea that order size would have a power law distribution is not implausible given that many related quantities , such as firm size ( axtell .",
    "2001 ) , wealth ( pareto , 1896 ) and mutual fund size ( gabaix et al , 2003 ) , have power law distributions .",
    "we have tended to discuss the autocorrelation of order signs as though this were a primary property , and the behavior of volume and liquidity are consequences , which must exist in order to maintain market efficiency .",
    "an alternative is that this reasoning is reversed , and that the autocorrelation of volume and liquidity are primary properties , and that of order signs is a consequence .",
    "however , it still remains to be determined why any of these should have such strong temporal autocorrelations . at this stage",
    "we simply do nt know what causes this phenomenon , but it is clearly a remarkable aspect of human economic activity that deserves more attention .",
    "even if we take the existence of long - memory as a given , we have not explained the strategic behavior that ensures efficiency . while the correlated long - memory behavior of order signs , volume , and liquidity are necessary to maintain efficiency , why are market participants motivated to make this happen ?",
    "what profit - seeking or risk - avoiding motives drive market participants to place orders in such a way that order size and liquidity are anti - correlated with runs in order signs ?    to illustrate the problem , we will propose and then critique a possible explanation based on market makers incentive to control prices . during a run of buy market orders , which would normally tend to drive the price up , market makers as a group are by definition sellers , and their positions become more negative .",
    "if this is accompanied by a price rise they will tend to lose money .",
    "to prevent this they might intentionally manipulate liquidity to prevent or reduce upward price movements , by supplying more liquidity at the ask than the bid . in a specialist system",
    "in which a single agent has a monopoly on market making this might be a reasonable explanation .",
    "however , in a competitive environment such as the lse , where there are many market makers , this is more difficult to explain : the individual who takes the lead in controlling the price will experience the largest adverse change in position . we know",
    "that on average buy orders do tend to drive the price up ( there is on average market impact ) , so this behavior should systematically result in losses .",
    "this suggests that either the market makers as a group collude to control prices , sharing the burden between them , or that this is not the correct explanation for this behavior .",
    "an alternative hypothesis that we consider more plausible is that liquidity providers take advantage of trends in order flow to acquire a desired position .",
    "so , for example , consider a liquidity provider that wants to sell , either to unload an existing inventory or to take a new tactical position .",
    "when a buying trend develops , she takes advantage of it by placing larger sell limit orders at or near the ask . from this point of view",
    ", one might reverse the usual terminology , and think of market orders as providing liquidity for limit orders by making them more likely to be executed . under this hypothesis ,",
    "liquidity providers take advantage of an imbalance in market order flow , thereby damping the response of the price .",
    "one clue about the long - memory behavior of order flow is that we see it for some institutions and not for others .",
    "this might be caused by differences in order splitting strategies .",
    "however , at this stage this is just speculation .",
