    "in this paper , we demonstrate that the rate of atomic non - radiative decay in an endohedral system @xmath6 strongly depends on the location of the atom inside the fullerene cage . in particular , the width of the auger decay can be varied by orders of magnitudes by increasing the atomic displacement @xmath7 from the cage center .",
    "as @xmath7 increases the most pronounced enhancement of the width occurs for the transitions whose energy lies in the vicinity of the fullerene surface plasmon of high multipolarity .    to analyze the influence of the fullerene electron shell on the atomic decay we consider two physical mechanisms .",
    "the first one accounts for the change in the electric field at the atom due to the dynamic polarization of the shell by the coulomb field of the transferring atomic electron @xcite .",
    "this scheme is similar to the one which leads to the modification of radiative and auger decays in an isolated atom due to the intrashell many - electron correlations @xcite . within the second mechanism",
    "the energy , released in the atomic transition , is transferred via the coulomb interaction to the fullerene electron which becomes ionized . in @xcite",
    "this mechanism was called interatomic coulombic decay , thus pointing out its close relationship with the interatomic decay process in various molecular clusters @xcite .",
    "the influence of the fullerene electron shell on the processes of radiative and non - radiative decays of a vacancy in the atom was analyzed for spherically symmetric endohedral systems @xmath8 , in which the atom @xmath9 is placed at the center of the spherical cage of the @xmath10 fullerene @xcite .",
    "it was noted that the interatomic coulombic decay leads to a dramatic increase of the atomic decay rate , especially in the case when a non - radiative transition in the isolated atom is energetically forbidden .",
    "the estimates presented in the cited papers show that the interatomic decay mechanism in @xmath8 can increase the radiative decay rate by a factor @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact of the dynamic polarization of the fullerene on the atomic auger width was found to be negligibly small for the at - the - center location of the atom @xcite .",
    "another prediction made in @xcite concerns the modification of the atomic auger width due to the interference between a direct wave of the electron emitted in the auger process and its waves scattered from the cage .",
    "this effect is identic to the one in the photoionization process of an endohedral atom , where the interference of the direct and scattered photoelectron waves can lead to the so - called confinement resonances @xcite in the photoionization cross section . in recent years",
    "a number of theoretical predictions have been made on the properties of the confinement resonances in various spherical endohedral systems ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) .",
    "however , so far these predictions have not been supported experimentally .",
    "the explanation of the discrepancy between the predictions and experimental results was presented recently @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the structure of confinement resonances in the photoionization cross section of an endohedral atom is very sensitive to the mean displacement @xmath12 of the atom from the cage center .",
    "the resonances are strongly suppressed if @xmath13 exceeds the photoelectron half - wavelength .",
    "decrease in the amplitude of the confinement resonances with the increase of the doped atom displacement from the cage center was also noted in @xcite .",
    "taking into account similar nature of the confinement resonances in the photoionization and auger decay processes we can state that the interference effects will not affect the auger widths if the emitted electron wavelength satisfies the criterion formulated above .",
    "the experimental data on the photoionization of a@c@xmath14 are sparse due to the difficulty to produce sufficient amounts of purified endohedrals for the gas phase experiments @xcite .",
    "the cross sections in the region of giant atomic resonances were measured for dy@c@xmath15 @xcite , ce@c@xmath15 @xcite , pr@c@xmath15 @xcite and ce@c@xmath16 @xcite .    apart from these the measured cross sections for photoionization of the endofullerene sc@xmath4n@c@xmath17 in the photon energy range @xmath18 ev were reported in @xcite .",
    "these data are of the prime interest in connection with the topic of the present paper .",
    "indeed , as it was shown theoretically @xcite and also confirmed experimentally @xcite , the cross section of photoionization of an isolated ion sc@xmath1 in the indicated energy range is dominated by a set of narrow resonances due to the excitations of the 3p electrons to intermediate autoionizing states .",
    "hence , taking into account that each scandium atom in @xmath19 carries a positive charge @xmath20 @xcite , it is natural to expect the manifestation of the autoionizing resonances in the photoionization of the endofullerene .",
    "however , such distinct structure has not been seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "instead , the presence of the endohedral molecule @xmath21 resulted in a single wide peak ( of 6 ev full width at half maximum ) in the photoionization curve of @xmath19 .",
    "in @xcite it was mentioned that such a dramatic modification can be due to the presence of the fullerene cage which could cause significant broadening of any atomic resonance features in photoionization .",
    "the intriguing experimental results of @xcite has stimulated our present study on the dependence of the atomic non - radiative decay processes on the doped atom displacement from the cage center .",
    "for doing this we developed a formalism which allows one to determine the corrections to the atomic auger width due to the dynamics of the fullerene electrons . within the framework of the formalism , which is presented in , one accounts for the off - the - center position of the doped atom and expresses the corrections in terms of the fullerene multipole dynamic polarizabilities of the second kind .",
    "on the basis of the developed formalism in we carry out quantitative analysis of the dependence of the autoionizing width on the displacement @xmath7 .",
    "this is done for the sc@xmath1 ion encaged in the fullerene c@xmath5 .",
    "the obtained data are used further to calculate the photoionization spectrum for the endohedral complex sc@xmath4n@c@xmath17 in the photon energy range @xmath18 ev . in [ multipolpolar ] we discuss different types of polarizabilities of the hollow objects and present the model description of the dynamic multipole polarizabilities of a fullerene .",
    "the atomic system of units is used through the paper .",
    "for the sake of clarity and consistency of the notations and terminology adopted below in the paper , let us outline basic formalism related to the calculation of the auger width in an isolated atom .",
    "the auger decay of the vacancy in an isolated atom can be illustrated by the diagram presented in figure [ diagram1.fig](a ) .",
    "the inner vacancy @xmath22 is filled by the electron from the outer state @xmath23 . due to the interelectron coulomb interaction @xmath24 the released energy @xmath25",
    "is transferred to another electron from state @xmath26 which becomes ionized ( @xmath27 stands for the asymptotic momentum of the outgoing electron ) .",
    "the energy conservation implies @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath30 of the process from figure [ diagram1.fig](a ) is proportional to the two - electron coulomb matrix element @xmath31 . presenting the wavefunctions of single - electron states",
    "@xmath32 as products of angular and radial parts , and using the standard multipole expansions of @xmath33 and of the outgoing electron wavefunction , one derives the analytical expression for @xmath30 ( the subscript @xmath9 stresses that the quantity refers to the isolated atom ) . in what follows , for the sake of concreteness , we focus on the _ dipole _ transitions @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as it is discussed further in the paper , the presence of the fullerene cage , which radius noticeably exceeds that of the endohedral atom",
    ", most strongly affects the dipole auger transitions . in the dipole approximation",
    "the amplitude can be written as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the @xmath38-symbol .",
    "the non - indexed quantities on the right - hand side refer to the outgoing electron , whereas the indexed ones ( the subscripts @xmath39 ) - to the states @xmath40 .",
    "the factors @xmath41 take into account that within the non - relativistic framework the spin projections @xmath42 are not changed in the transitions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the notation @xmath43 stands for the set of principal and orbital quantum numbers , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the scattering phaseshifts . the quantity @xmath46 denotes the dipole radial coulomb matrix element : @xmath47 where @xmath48",
    ".    equation ( [ auger_dipole.1 ] ) has been derived in a single - electron approximation . to account for the electron correlations one substitutes @xmath46 with the corresponding matrix element of the effective interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the width , which defines the probability ( per unit time ) of the auger transition , one calculates starting from the following general formula : @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the partial width of the transition @xmath51 .    using ( [ auger_dipole.1 ] ) in ( [ width1.1 ] ) , one derives the following expression for the partial width of the dipole auger transition in the isolated atom : @xmath52      if the atom is encaged in a fullerene c@xmath53 , the atomic decay process can be strongly influenced due to the excitations ( real or virtual ) of the fullerene electrons @xcite .    to start with we mention , that the atomic auger decay can occur via the additional channel , diagrammatical representation of which",
    "is given in figure [ diagram1.fig](b ) @xcite . here",
    ", the energy @xmath54 released in the transition @xmath55 is transferred to the electron @xmath26 not directly , as in the process from figure [ diagram1.fig](a ) , but via the virtual excitation of the fullerene .",
    "the diagrams [ diagram1.fig](b ) constitute the correction term , @xmath56 , to the amplitude of the auger decay .",
    "hence , the total amplitude of the auger decay in the encapsulated atom reads @xmath57    physically , the virtual excitation implies that the coulomb interaction between two atomic electrons , @xmath23 and @xmath26 , is modified due to the polarization of the fullerene shell .",
    "the polarization is dynamic , i.e. it depends on the transition energy @xmath58 , so that @xmath56 is proportional to the dynamic susceptibility of the fullerene",
    ". thus , one can expect , that in those @xmath58-regions where the modulus of susceptibility is large enough , the additional channel can modify noticeably the width of the transition @xmath59 .    in @xcite",
    "the additional channel of the dipole auger decay was analyzed for an atom placed _ at the center _ of a spherically - symmetric fullerene .",
    "assuming the atomic radius @xmath60 to be much smaller than the fullerene radius @xmath61 , the authors expressed the amplitude @xmath62 in terms of dynamic dipole polarizability of the fullerene .",
    "then , carrying out the order - of - magnitude estimate they found that @xmath63 , i.e. , the correction is much smaller that the auger amplitude in the isolated atom in the whole range of @xmath0 .    below in the paper",
    "we demonstrate , that the relative magnitude of the correction term is governed not only by @xmath0 ( this has been already noted in @xcite ) but also is strongly dependent on the position of the atom inside the cage .",
    "the parameter , which defines this dependence , is the ratio @xmath64 , where @xmath7 stands for the displacement of the atom from the cage center .",
    "below in this section we demonstrate , that the correction term as a function of both @xmath58 and @xmath64 varies by orders of magnitude .",
    "this can result in the dominance of the additional channel over the direct auger decay ( see the case study presented in section [ numerics_sc2 + ] ) .",
    "let us outline the derivation of the correction term @xmath65 for the dipole auger transition occurring in the atom ( nucleus charge @xmath66 , average radius @xmath60 ) , located inside spherically - symmetric fullerene ( average radius of the cage @xmath61 , average width of the shell @xmath67 ) and displaced by @xmath68 from the cage center , see figure [ atom-cage.fig ] .     and",
    "@xmath67 , respectively .",

    "the quantity @xmath84 also is related to the multipole expansion of the electrostatic field created by electron charge distributed in the fullerene shell ( the sum is carried out over the fullerene electrons ) . to distinguish @xmath85 from @xmath81 we call the former as the operator of `` interior @xmath83-pole moment '' of the fullerene ( see [ multipolpolar_1 ] for the details ) .",
    "the argument @xmath7 on the left - hand side of ( [ d_auger.4 ] ) is added to stress that the amplitude is dependent on the displacement from the center .    inserting",
    "( [ atom - cage.4 ] ) into ( [ d_auger.4 ] ) , one carries out the intermediate algebra and arrives at the following expression for the amplitude of the _ dipole _ @xmath34 and @xmath35 transitions : @xmath86 here @xmath87 and @xmath88 stand for the radial matrix elements of the atomic dipole moment , @xmath89 is the fullerene s dynamic @xmath90-pole polarizability of the second kind .",
    "this type of polarizability appears when one is interested in the modification of the electric field inside the fullerene due to its polarization under the action of the @xmath90-pole external field whose source is also located in the fullerene interior .",
    "this is in contrast to the `` conventional '' polarizability @xmath91 which is responsible for the same effect but in the case where both the source and the observation point are located outside the fullerene ( see [ multipolpolar ] for more details ) .",
    "summing up ( [ auger_dipole.1 ] ) and ( [ d_auger_non_central4.1 ] ) one constructs the total amplitude @xmath92 of the dipole auger decay .",
    "then , using @xmath92 in ( [ width1.1 ] ) , one derives the following set of expressions , which defines the partial width of the transition @xmath93 in the encaged atom : @xmath94 the factor @xmath95 , which depends on the atom s displacement , takes into account the width modification due to the presence of the fullerene ( for an isolated atom @xmath96 ) . it can be written in the form @xmath97 the factor @xmath98 is constructed from the atomic characteristics only : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the partial radiative width of the transition @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the partial cross section of photoionization of the subshell @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is given by ( [ width2.2 ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath105 are dependent on the displacement @xmath7 and on the fullerene s dynamic multipole polarizabilities of the second kind : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the light velocity in the atomic units .",
    "as a function of the fullerene cage radius @xmath61 the polarizability @xmath108 scales as @xmath109 ( see ( [ multipolpolar_2.02 ] ) and ( [ modifiedpra.6 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the expansion parameter in the series ( [ d_auger_non_central5.13b ] ) is @xmath110 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath111 ( atom at - the - center ) only dipole terms with @xmath112 contribute to the sums ( [ d_auger_non_central5.13b ] ) .",
    "hence , one finds @xmath113 and @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the dynamic dipole polarizability of the fullerene ( the transformation from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , which leads to the approximate equality , is explained in [ appendix_b ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the factor ( [ d_auger_non_central5.12 ] ) reduces to @xmath118    expression ( [ d_auger_non_central5.14b ] ) was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the authors , estimating the magnitude of the correction term in the brackets as @xmath119 , derived @xmath120 .",
    "thus , it was tacitly concluded that the additional channel of the atomic auger decay , figure [ diagram1.fig](b ) , does not affect the decay rate if the atom is placed at the center .",
    "however , as the displacement @xmath7 from the cage center increases , the larger contribution to the sums from ( [ d_auger_non_central5.13b ] ) comes from the terms with higher @xmath121 .",
    "this leads to a noticeable increase in magnitude of the factor @xmath95 not only in the vicinity of the fullerene giant plasmon resonance but in a much wider range of transition energies @xmath122 .",

    "indeed , these correction terms are dependent also on the factor @xmath133 , whose magnitude is determined by atomic characteristics taken at given energy ( see equation ( [ d_auger_non_central5.13a ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , studying the curves in figure [ sigma_c80.fig ] one can speculate that , as the displacement increases , the region @xmath134 ev becomes favourable from the viewpoint the auger width modification due to the channel depictured in figure [ diagram1.fig](b ) . within the indicated interval",

    "the enhancement is more pronounced at @xmath137 ev ( see the solid curve in both graphs in figure [ sigma_c80.fig ] .",
    "this energy corresponds to the dipole plasmon resonance associated with the symmetric mode of the coupled oscillations of the charges induced at the fullerene surfaces ( see [ pra ] ) .",

    "therefore , a good candidate for the auger width modification due to the mechanism from figure [ diagram1.fig](b ) would be an atom whose auger spectrum has pronounced peaks in the range @xmath134 ev , and which , being encaged , is located far off - the - center . the molecule sc@xmath4n@c@xmath17 is a good example of this sort .",
    "indeed , three scandium atoms are symmetrically located far from the center being displaced by @xmath141  @xcite . in this complex , each scandium atom donates 2 electrons to the fullerene cage .",

    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the auger decay rate in an endohedral atom is very sensitive to the atom s location in the fullerene cage as well as to the energy @xmath0 released in the decay process .",
    "two additional decay channels have been considered , which appear in an endohedral system and lead to the modification of the rate .",
    "firstly , there is a correction to the direct auger - decay channel due to the change in the electric field at the atom caused by dynamic polarization of the fullerene electron shell by the coulomb field of the decaying vacancy . in principle",
    ", this correction can be of either sign ( depending on @xmath0 ) , and , thus , can either increase or decrease the decay rate . within the second channel",
    "the released energy is transferred to the fullerene electron via the coulomb interaction .",
    "the contributions of both additional mechanisms are expressed in terms of the fullerene dynamic multipole polarizabilities of the second kind .",
    "this type of polarizabilities appears when one is interested in the modification of the electric field in the interior of any hollow object ( e.g. , a fullerene ) due to its polarization under the action of the external field whose source is also located inside the object .",
    "this is in contrast to the `` conventional '' polarizability which is responsible for the same effect but in the case , when both the source and the observation point are located in the exterior .",
    "thus , one can expect the modification of the decay rate to be most pronounced in those @xmath0-regions where the polarizabilities of the second kind are large enough .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the correction terms are governed not only by the transition energy but also are strongly dependent on the position of the doped atom .",
    "( this feature is absent in the radiative decay process . )",
    "the parameter , which defines this dependence , is the ratio of the off - the - center atomic displacement @xmath7 from the fullerene center to the average radius @xmath61 of the cage .",
    "as @xmath64 increases the enhancement of the width occurs for the transitions whose energies are in the vicinity of the fullerene surface plasmons energies of high multipolarity .",
    "we have demonstrated that the correction terms as functions of both @xmath0 and @xmath64 vary by orders of magnitude .",
    "this can result in the dominance of the additional channels over the direct auger decay and can lead to pronounced broadening of the atomic emission lines .    on the basis of the developed formalism we carried out a case study for the system sc@xmath1@c@xmath2 .",
    "it has been demonstrated that narrow resonances in the spectrum of an isolated sc@xmath1 in the energy range @xmath3 ev are noticeably broadened if the ion is located strongly off - the - center ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "our model allowed us to carry out the quantitative analysis of the photoionization of the endohedral complex sc@xmath4n@c@xmath5 .",
    "we have demonstrated that due to the the non - central position of the three scandium atoms as well as to the fact that the multipolar surface plasmons energies of the fullerene lie within the indicated range , the additional decay channels can be responsible , at least partly , for the strong modification of the photoionization spectrum profile detected experimentally .",

    "in this appendix we present general definitions and discuss basic properties of different types of multipole polarizabilities which characterize the response of a hollow object to an external electric field . by a hollow object",
    "we will understand any object which has at least one cavity in its interior .",
    "a fullerene @xmath235 , whose ( average ) radius @xmath61 greatly exceeds the radius of valence electrons in a carbon atom , can be treated as a hollow object if one neglects the probability to observe electrons in most part of the fullerene interior .",

    "the polarization of this object leads to an additional electric field whose potential ( or / and strength ) depend on the multipolarity of the external field , on the distance from the system to the observation point , and on the ( multipole ) polarizability , i.e. the quantity which describes the system s response to the external field .",
    "if an object has no internal cavity ( e.g. , an atom , a simple molecule ) , it is natural to assume that a source of the external field ( e.g. , a point - like charge ) is located outside the object . then one can distinguishes two different cases : the observation point is located ( i ) outside or ( ii ) inside the object .",
    "the different quantities are responsible for the system s response in these two cases . conventionally ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the characteristic associated with case ( i ) is called a polarizability , whilst case ( ii ) is described by the quantity termed `` a shielding factor '' .    as discussed below , the response of a hollow object to the action of an external electric field can be described in terms of _ three _ different quantities .",
    "in addition to the two mentioned ones , the third quantity corresponds to the situation when both the external charge and the observation point are located inside the object .",
    "let us briefly discuss the quantum formalism which one can apply for a quantitative description of these quantities . for the sake of simplicity , we consider the following model hollow object ( called below a fullerene ) : a system of @xmath236 electrons located in the vicinity of the spherically - symmetric ionic cage of the radius @xmath61 .",

    "to avoid ambiguity we call this quantity the _interior _ @xmath83-pole moment.    under the action of the multipolar field @xmath250 the electron cloud in the fullerene becomes polarized .",
    "this polarization causes the change in the potential , @xmath251 , created by the electrons . applying standard perturbation theory",

    "see explanation in the text for the parameters used in the calculations .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we mention the following two features of the presented dependences .",
    "firstly , as it is seen from equation ( [ polariz.5 ] ) , with the growth of @xmath121 the frequencies @xmath307 and @xmath308 approach the same limit : @xmath307 goes to @xmath343 from below whereas @xmath308  from above . as a result ,",
    "the two resonances in both @xmath341 and @xmath342 merge as @xmath121 increases .",
    "secondly , the second ( antisymmetric ) surface plasmon peak is quite pronounced for @xmath342 ( i.e. , in the dynamic polarizability of the second kind ) whereas in the case of @xmath341 its magnitude relative to the symmetric peak is much smaller . as @xmath121 increases ( and until the peaks merge ) the heights of symmetric and antisymmetric resonances nearly equalize in the case of @xmath342 , whereas for @xmath341 the antisymmetric peak quickly disappears .",
    "the reason for such difference in the resonance curves behaviour is related to the different number of valence electrons participating in symmetric and antisymmetric modes , see ( [ polariz.3 ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath344 rapidly decreases with @xmath121 ( the ratio equals to @xmath345 for @xmath112 and to @xmath346 for @xmath347 ) .",
    "hence , the number of oscillators associated with the antisymmetric mode in @xmath341 , which is @xmath348 , rapidly decreases , thus destroying the peak at @xmath308 . on the contrary , in @xmath342 where the antisymmetric mode is defined by @xmath349 oscillators , the relative intensity of its peak increases .      to conclude appendix",
    "let us mention a transformation which allows one to _ approximately _ relate the polarizabilities @xmath266 and @xmath269 . to simplify the algebra we consider the case of a spherically symmetric fullerene with the cage radius @xmath61 and the thickness @xmath67 .",
    "assuming the strong inequality @xmath350 one reduces the interior @xmath83-pole moment @xmath246 to regular solid harmonics @xmath247",
    "@xmath246 ( see equation ( [ multipolpolar_1.03 ] ) ) as follows : @xmath351 using this result in ( [ multipolpolar_2.01 ] ) one arrives at @xmath352 sometimes such approximation is used to estimate the dynamic response of a fullerene to the external field ( see , e.g. , ( @xcite ) ) . however , the accuracy of the approximation is subject to ( comparatively ) low @xmath121-values and to a strong inequality @xmath350 .",
    "thus , if one considers , for example , the fullerene c@xmath144 , for which @xmath353 , then equation ( [ appendix_b.02 ] ) can be used only for the order - of - magnitude estimations and for @xmath154 .",
    "the accuracy will increase for giant fullerenes ( e.g. , for c@xmath354 where which @xmath355 ) .",
    "additionally , for low @xmath121-values this approximation neglects the difference between the profiles of symmetric and antisymmetric surface plasmon modes in @xmath266 , @xmath270 and @xmath269 ( to compare the profiles in @xmath269 and in @xmath266  see figure [ a_l_c80.fig ] ) .",
