    "our main result is a new form for the potential and electron density depth profiles in various planar sto structures due to the nonlinear dielectric response . in particular , for an accumulation layer in sto created by an external interfacial induction @xmath1 , we find an electron concentration @xmath32 that depends on the distance from the surface @xmath33 as @xmath2 , where the width @xmath28 decreases with @xmath1 as @xmath34 .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] provides a summary and conclusion .",
    "bulk sto typically is an @xmath4-type semiconductor with a concentration of donors @xmath54 .",
    "let us discuss the position of fermi energy @xmath55 in such crystals .",
    "the electron spectrum near the bottom of the conduction band is complicated  @xcite , and in order to make the problem of an accumulation layer tractable analytically we assume that it is isotropic and non - degenerate with the effective mass @xmath56 , @xcite where @xmath39 is free electron mass . within the hydrogenic theory of shallow donors , the donor bohr radius is equal to @xmath36 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the electron charge , and @xmath20 is dielectric constant of the material . at room temperature",
    "when @xmath59 , the bohr radius @xmath60 is so large that the mott criterion for the metal - insulator transition in doped semiconductors @xmath61 leads to a very small critical concentration @xmath62 . at helium temperatures @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus , at the experimentally relevant concentration of donors @xmath65 , we are dealing with a moderately doped semiconductor in which the fermi energy lies in the conduction band of sto . on the other hand , due to the relatively high effective mass",
    "the bulk fermi energy @xmath55 is smaller than the bending energy of the conduction band bottom near the interface ( see fig . [",

    "for example , for @xmath66 , the low temperature fermi energy calculated from the bottom of the conduction band is @xmath67 which can be up to @xmath68 times smaller than the bending energy of the conduction band bottom in an accumulation layer for gto / sto .",
    "therefore , we assume below that the fermi energy coincides with the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "we are interested in the electron distribution near an interface of sto .",
    "we consider the case when the axis @xmath33 is directed perpendicular to the interface ( plane @xmath69 ) and lies along the [ 100 ] axis of a cubic crystal of sto .",

    "this condition relates @xmath90 and @xmath80 ,    @xmath92    we note that @xmath93 and thus @xmath94 .",

    "the donor cluster atom becomes a positive ion with charge @xmath419 .",
    "recall that the tf approach is valid at all distances until @xmath259 .",
    "the first ionization energy of the cluster atom is then negligible ( @xmath420 ev ) .",
    "so the cluster atoms are always partially ionized .",
    "our goal below is to find this ionization charge for the spherical donor clusters .",
    "similar analyses for the cylindrical clusters can be found in ref . and are not repeated here .",
    "we assume that we have a small but finite three - dimensional concentration @xmath421 of spherical clusters and the charge @xmath422 , i. e. , the outer electron shell is still incompletely ionized .",
    "such a cluster can bind electrons with an ionization energy @xmath423 .",
    "we can find @xmath424 by equating this energy with the decrease in the free energy per electron @xmath425 due to the entropy increase ( the entropy increase can be derived according to @xmath426 104 of ref . ) , where @xmath427 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath428 is the concentration of ionized electrons and @xmath429 with @xmath430 as the debroglie wavelength of free electrons at temperature @xmath383 . at @xmath348 , @xmath431 , @xmath432 where @xmath433 is the electron mass and @xmath434 @xmath435 ( estimated from that the concentration of total donor electrons is around @xmath436 @xmath435 and each cluster contributes @xmath437 donor electrons ) , we get @xmath438 at @xmath439 k with @xmath440 which is a reasonable estimate .",
    "this shows that the outer electrons are completely ionized at temperatures that are not too low . for the inner core electrons ,",
    "the dielectric response is nonlinear and the attractive potential is stronger .",
    "so the ionization energy is higher @xmath441 for electrons at @xmath442 . at @xmath443",
    ", it is found that only at @xmath444 k can the inner electrons be ionized by a considerable quantity ( the @xmath445 tail is completely stripped then ) .",
    "so the inner electrons are robust against the thermal ionization .",
    "experimentally , charged clusters can be created controllably on the surface of lao / sto structure when the lao layer is of subcritical thickness @xmath446 unit cell @xcite . a conducting atomic force microscope ( afm ) tip is placed in contact with the top laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) surface and biased at certain voltage with respect to the interface , which is held at electric ground .",
    "when the voltage is positive , a locally metallic interface is produced between lao and sto where some positive charges are accumulated in the shape of a disc .",
    "the same writing process can also create a periodic array of charged discs .",
    "let us first concentrate on a disc of positive charge created in this manner on the sto surface .",
    "close to the surface and in the bulk sto , one should apply the plane solution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : conventration_nonlinear ] ) .",
    "when the distance @xmath262 from the disc center is large , i.e. , @xmath353 , the disc behaves like a charged sphere .",
    "our results for a sphere are still qualitatively correct in this case .    in a periodic array of highly charged discs with period @xmath164 ( see fig . 3a in ref . ) , the linear concentration of free electrons responsible for the conductance at a very low temperature is of the order of @xmath447 , where @xmath263 is the electron density around a spherical donor cluster given by sec . [",
    "sec : spherical ] .",
    "when the overlapping parts between neighboring discs belong to the outer electron shells , the corresponding density at @xmath448 is that of a thomas - fermi atom with charge @xmath16 . in this situation , the overlapping external atmosphere forms conductive  bridges \" between discs at low temperature .",
    "when @xmath383 increases , however , the outer electrons are ionized and the bridges are gone .",
    "these free electrons spread out over the bulk sto . at @xmath449 k , electrons are scattered mainly by the coulomb potential of donors and the corresponding mobility decreases with a decreased electron velocity . for the electrons ionized into the vast region of the bulk sto , they are no longer degenerate , so",
    "their velocity becomes much smaller at relatively low temperature .",
    "this results in a much smaller mobility of the ionized electrons than those bound along the chain .",
    "their contribution to the conductivity is thus negligible .",
    "the system becomes more resistive due to the ionization and one can observe a sharp decrease of the conductivity along the chain .",
    "in this paper we have studied the potential and electron density depth profiles in surface accumulation layers in crystals with a large and nonlinear dielectric response such as srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) in the cases of planar , spherical and cylindrical geometries .",
    "we use the landau - ginzburg free energy expansion for the dielectric response of sto and adopt the thomas - fermi approximation for its electron gas .    for the planar geometry",
    "we predict an electron density profile @xmath2 , where @xmath3 with @xmath1 as the surface induction and @xmath33 as the distance from the interface . here",
    "we skipped comparison of this result with the experimental data which can be found in ref . .",
    "the data generally show a reasonable agreement with our predictions .",
    "we extend our studies from a single accumulation layer to overlapping ones , and also investigate the electron  spill - out \" from a heavily @xmath4-type doped sto ( nsto ) into a moderately @xmath4-type doped sto .",
    "in the second part of this paper we study the collapse of electrons onto spherical and cylindrical donor clusters .",
    "such  fall - to - the - center \" originates from the very fast decrease of the electron potential energy near the cluster which is @xmath450 in the spherical case and in turn is a result of the strongly nonlinear dielectric response of sto .",
    "this leads to a very unusual two - scale shape of the electron density around the cluster .",
    "we show how one can verify such a shape experimentally .",
    "we are grateful to b. jalan , e. b. kolomeisky , m. schecter , and s. stemmer for helpful discussions .",
