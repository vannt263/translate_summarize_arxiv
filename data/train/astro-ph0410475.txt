    "reliable determinations of the oxygen and iron abundances in the atmospheres of metal - poor stars are of paramount importance for 21st century astrophysics .",
    "this is because the abundances of oxygen and iron in metal - poor stars represent fundamental astrophysical quantities for determining the ages of the oldest stars , for constraining the models of the chemical evolution of the galaxy , for estimating the yields of light elements ( lithium , beryllium and boron ) from spallation processes in the interstellar and circumstellar gas , for testing different scenarios of nucleosynthesis in supernovae , etc .",
    "such studies largely rely upon the oxygen - to - iron abundance ratio ( @xmath11}={\\rm log}{\\rm ( o / fe)}_{\\star}-{\\rm log}{\\rm ( o / fe)}_{\\odot}$ ] ) versus the stellar metallicity [ fe / h ] .",
    "the shape and spread of the [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation is still hotly debated in the literature ( e.g. , israelian et al .",
    "2001 ; asplund & garca prez 2001 ; melndez & barbuy 2002 ; nissen et al . 2002 ; fulbright & johnson 2003 ; takeda 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "the controversy is linked with discordant results obtained using different indicators of the oxygen abundance , such as : i ) the oxygen [ oi ] forbidden @xmath126300 line ; ii ) the oxygen oi infrared triplet at 77725  ; iii ) the oh lines in the near ultraviolet ; iv ) the oh lines in the infrared . more precisely , the oxygen abundance derived using all these lines agree more or less with each other for moderate metal - deficient disk stars having @xmath13 } \\le 0 $ ] . however , there are clear discrepancies among the results obtained for metal - poor halo stars with lower metallicities .",
    "some authors find that the [ o / fe ] ratio shows a plateau between 0.4 and 0.5 dex in the metallicity range -3@xmath14[fe / h]@xmath15 ( barbuy 1988 ; kraft et al .",
    "1992 ; fulbright & kraft 1999 ; asplund & garca prez 2001 ; caretta et al .",
    "2000 ; melndez & barbuy 2002 ) , while others find a linear increase with decreasing metallicity , reaching [ o / fe]@xmath16  dex at [ fe / h]@xmath17 ( abia & rebolo 1989 ; tomkin et al .",
    "1992 ; cavallo et al . 1997 ; israelian et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ; boesgaard et al . 1999 ; mishenina et al . 2000 ; and references therein ) . recently , nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have analyzed [ oi ] and [ feii ] lines within the framework of 3d atmospheric models and lte line formation concluding that there is a quasi - linear trend for [ fe / h]@xmath18 , with [ o / fe]@xmath19  dex at [ fe / h]@xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , an extensive 1d re - analysis of published equivalent widths for the oi ir and the forbidden [ oi ] lines ( see takeda 2003 ) shows that the discrepancy between oi and [ oi ] lines in metal - poor halo stars tends to be smaller for stars with higher effective temperatures ( @xmath21 ) and gravities ( @xmath22 ) , i.e. preferentially for dwarfs and subgiants than for giants .",
    "fulbright & johnson ( 2003 ) support this conclusion .",
    "in addition , the oxygen abundances in dwarfs derived from the oi ir lines tend to have values between those obtained with the uv oh and [ oi ] lines .      a key problem directly related with the [ o / fe ] issue in metal - poor stars is the reliability of the iron abundance determinations .",
    "in fact , the derivation of the iron abundance from fei and/or feii lines is a very complex problem that requires detailed non - lte investigations ( hereafter nlte ) like the one carried by shchukina & trujillo bueno ( 2001 ) and in this paper . in general",
    ", the fei lines suffer from uv overionization in the atmospheres of late - type stars ( athay and lites 1972 ; rutten 1988 ; shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 ) .",
    "this nlte effect tends to be substantially more important in metal - poor stars than in solar - like stars as a result of the lower electron density and of the weaker uv blanketing ( thvenin & idiart 1999 ; shchukina and trujillo bueno 2001 ; israelian et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ; shchukina et al .",
    "we should mention also that gratton et al.(1999 ) concluded that nlte effects are rather small in metal - poor stars .",
    "however , their calculations presumably overestimated the efficiency of inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms which thermalize the fei levels and thus almost restore lte conditions .",
    "it is of interest to point out that while the fei lines are ( in principle ) expected to be sensitive to the uv overionization mechanism , the lte approximation is thought to be suitable for weak lines of feii ( see , e.g. , asplund et al 1999 ; nissen et al .",
    "however , as we shall see below this does not have to be necessarily the case because many subordinate feii lines whose upper levels are of odd parity ( starting at @xmath23 ) might be partially filled by emission due to an optical pumping mechanism similar to that investigated by cram et al .",
    "( 1980 ) for the solar case .",
    "obviously , the solar case constitutes a fundamental reference for a reliable quantification of chemical abundances in other stars .",
    "the solar iron abundance appears to be fairly well determined now ( @xmath24(fe)=7.50@xmath25 ; see shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 )  that is , it is similar to the meteoritic value . in fact , this is the value adopted by nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in their study of the o / fe ratio in metal - poor stars .",
    "great progress has been also made towards a reliable determination of the solar oxygen abundance .",
    "the 1d modeling approach leads to discrepancies between the solar oxygen abundance determined from the permitted oi lines and from the [ oi ] and oh lines .",
    "abundance determinations from oh lines using the 1d model of holweger & m@xmath26ller ( 1974 ) suggested first a high oxygen abundance value ( @xmath27(o)=8.93@xmath28 ; see grevesse et al .",
    "1984 ; sauval et al . 1984",
    "; anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "several years later , grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) obtained an oxygen abundance that was lower by 0.1 dex .",
    "this lower value was found after using improved @xmath29 values and a slightly modified 1d model , which helped to remove the existence of a dependency of the derived oxygen abundance with the excitation potential of the lower level of the oh transitions .",
    "the forbidden [ oi ] line gives also a high oxygen abundance value when the contribution of the blend due to a nii line is ignored ( lambert , 1978 ; sauval et al .",
    "1984 ; holweger 2001 ) . however , the permitted oi lines at @xmath1277725   yield a value for the oxygen abundance that is lower by 0.2 dex ( kiselman 1993 ; holweger 2001 ) .",
    "some authors have argued that the existing nlte calculations for these spectroscopic indicators of the oxygen abundance might not be valid due to the neglect of inelastic collisions with hydrogen .",
    "for this reason the solar oxygen abundance derived from the [ oi ] forbidden line was considered as the most reliable one , because of the suitability of the lte approximation ( hence , uncertainties of collisional rates with hydrogen atoms do not play any role ) .",
    "another argument used to support a high value for the oxygen abundance is the small scatter in the oxygen abundances obtained from different oh lines .",
    "kiselman & nordlund ( 1995 ) tried to clarify the solar oxygen abundance issue by using a 3d solar photospheric model that is similar but less sophisticated than that of asplund et al .",
    "they concluded that a downward revision of the solar oxygen abundance is required , with respect to the value derived from [ oi ] and oh lines .",
    "more recently , allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have obtained a more precise estimate by taking into account the influence of the above - mentioned blend by the nii line and by using the 3d hydrodynamical model of asplund s et al .",
    "they found @xmath30(o)=8.69@xmath31 , which shows that the [ oi]-based abundance derived via the 3d approach is significantly lower than that derived from classical 1d model atmospheres . in a recent iau symposium on modeling of stellar atmospheres shchukina et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported that the oxygen abundance obtained via nlte synthesis of the solar oi ir triplet in the 3d solar photosphere model of asplund s et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is @xmath32(o)@xmath33 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with both allende prieto s et al .",
    "( 2001 ) conclusion and with the recent 3d analysis of asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who found excellent agreement between the averaged oxygen abundance values derived from [ oi ] , oi , oh vibration - rotation and oh pure rotation lines .",
    "it is currently believed that abundance discrepancies in metal - poor halo stars and the sun are dominated by deficiencies in the spectral line modeling .",
    "errors in the measurements of equivalent widths are of minor importance with the exception of weak [ oi ] and feii lines .",
    "all abundance indicators in metal - poor stars are to a different degree sensitive to the adopted stellar parameters ( @xmath21 , @xmath34 and [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "they have to depend also on atmospheric properties such as the temperature gradient and the ratio of the line to continuous opacity .",
    "large uncertainties could result from neglecting atmospheric inhomogeneities and velocity fields ( i.e. , granulation inhomogeneities produced by the stellar surface convection process ) .",
    "part of the discrepancies are probably due to nlte effects .",
    "there is now an abundance of literature concerning the iron and oxygen line formation problems in classical plane - parallel stellar atmospheric models ( thvenin & idiart 1999 ; mishenina et al .",
    "2000 ; kiselman 2001 ; takeda 2003 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the recent generation of 3d hydrodynamical models of stellar atmospheres have activated the present debates on the influence of granulation inhomogeneities and of nlte effects on the determination of chemical abundances in metal - poor stars ( see asplund et al .",
    "1999 ; asplund and garca prez et al . 2001 ; shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 ; nissen et al . 2002",
    "; asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this respect",
    ", it is very important to emphasize that the 3d hydrodynamical simulations of asplund and coworkers show that the atmospheres of metal - poor halo stars may have substantially lower kinetic temperatures than the radiative equilibrium temperatures of the ` classical ' theoretical 1d model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1993 ) and the marcs collaboration ( gustafsson et al .",
    "1975 ) .",
    "the previous discussion makes evident that detailed , 3d+nlte investigations of the iron and oxygen abundances are urgently needed .",
    "however , it is crucial that this type of analyses are carried out _ jointly _ for iron and oxygen , and using the same set of atmospheric models , continuum opacity package and radiative transfer code .",
    "the present paper presents the results of such an investigation .",
    "we study the nlte formation problem of the fei , feii and oi lines in a 3d hydrodynamical model of the atmosphere of the metal - poor star hd140283 .",
    "this classical halo subgiant is widely used for studies of the very early galaxy and the origin of the chemical elements . in order to quantify the impact of 3d simulations on the abundance determinations in hd140283 we carry out a detailed comparison with the 1d classical modeling . to this end",
    ", we use the 3d hydrodynamical atmospheric model of asplund s et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the star hd140283 , as well as a suitable grid of kurucz s 1d models .",
    "moreover , we evaluate the extent to which 3d+nlte effects influence the determination of the stellar parameters of this metal - poor subgiant .",
    "our paper considers also the case of the sun as a reference for stellar abundance determinations with emphasis on the solar oxygen abundance derived from the oi ir triplet . as in our nlte+3d analysis of the solar iron abundance ( shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 )",
    "we investigate here the solar oxygen abundance problem by using the same 3d hydrodynamical solar granulation model .",
    "in order to determine the stellar abundances of iron and oxygen we have to compare some of the properties of the observed spectral line profiles ( e.g. , their equivalent widths ) with those calculated via the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation in a given model of the atmosphere of the star under investigation . to this end",
    ", we have used the same nlte code and strategy that we applied in our previous investigation of the iron line formation problem in a 3d hydrodynamic model of the solar photosphere ( see shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 ) , with the only difference that we have now computed flux profiles .",
    "our 3d strategy for investigating the issue of the abundances of iron and oxygen in the metal - poor star hd140283 is similar to that of described by shchukina & trujillo bueno ( 2001 ) for solar - like atmospheres , but using a 3d snapshot model from asplund s et al .",
    "( 1999 ) stellar surface convection simulation .",
    "therefore , we have neglected the effects of horizontal radiative transfer on the atomic level populations -that is , we have used the so - called 1.5d approximation . as discussed by shchukina & trujillo bueno ( 2001 ) this",
    "is expected to be a good approximation for determining the stellar iron abundance from fei and feii lines .",
    "kiselman & nordlund ( 1995 ) already demonstrated that it is also a good approximation for the oxygen ir triplet .",
    "our nlte code is based on very efficient iterative methods ( trujillo bueno & fabiani bendicho 1995 ; socas - navarro & trujillo bueno 1997 ; trujillo bueno 2003 ) that were developed to facilitate radiative transfer simulations with complex atomic systems in realistic stellar atmospheric models .",
    "we have carried out both lte and nlte spectral line syntheses by using both the 1d and 3d models mentioned below . in each case , the abundances of iron and oxygen are modified iteratively till achieving the best fit to the observations .",
    "we have chosen 33 fei and 15 feii lines for our 3d and 1d determinations of the iron abundance in the halo subgiant hd140283 .",
    "the equivalent widths ( @xmath35 ) of all the fei lines and of 11 feii lines were obtained from high - resolution spectra observed a few years ago with the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory ( r. garca lpez , private communication ; see also allende prieto et al .",

    "overlapping wings of nearby strong lines cause large uncertainties in the equivalent width measurements of most of the solar fei lines listed in table 1 .",
    "the only exception are the lines at @xmath74   ( i.e. only 8 fei lines from 33 ones ) . in any case , the main reason why not the same lines can be used in the sun and hd140283 is that the line strengths are vastly different in the two cases .",
    "therefore , the weak iron lines in hd140283 are very strong and therefore ill - suited for abundance purposes in the sun . thus , to recalculate the iron abundance of the sun using the lines of table 1 is hardly possible .",
    "the solar fei lines used in our 3d solar abundance determination ( see table 1 in shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 ) were selected from the well - known `` kiel+oxford '' line list according to the criteria discussed by kostik , shchukina & rutten 1996 .",
    "the lines chosen by shchukina & trujillo bueno ( 2001 ) account for the iron abundance behaviour versus the lower - level excitation potential @xmath75 -that is , for the existence of both an abundance dependence on @xmath75 and a sizable scatter in the abundance values for each @xmath75 .",

    "the 3d+lte approach gives a lower abundance , i.e. @xmath27(fe)=7.43@xmath76 . neglecting the effect of granulation inhomogeneities leads to a considerably larger value ( @xmath27(fe)=7.62@xmath77 ; e.g. kostik et al .",

    ", near - uv overionization appears to be the main nlte mechanism for fei in this metal - poor star . both in the 1d and 3d models it causes an important underpopulation of the fei levels and hence a reduction in the opacity of the fei lines ( fig . 1 , left panel ) . as a result ,",
    "the atmospheric heights where the line optical depth reaches unity are shifted toward deeper layers where the line source functions turn out to be close to the planck function .",
    "the relevance of this effect increases with the vertical temperature gradient , which is larger above the granules . for this reason",

    "the calculated nlte profiles turn out to be much weaker than when the lte approximation is used ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . concerning nlte effects in feii lines",
    "it is very important to point out that in the granular regions we find a significant overpopulation of the excited levels of odd parity starting at @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) . according to cram et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and rutten ( 1988 ) this effect is caused by an excess in the uv continuum radiation field near 2600  , which leads to a pumping of the upper level populations of the feii lines . as a consequence , the source functions of the feii lines with high excitation energy of the upper level ( @xmath78  ev ) exceed significantly the planck function values .",
    "this implies that such feii lines are weaker than stipulated by the lte approximation and may even be in emission instead of in absorption .",
    "this radiative pumping mechanism takes place in both the 1d and 3d models .",
    "like in the case of fei lines it is sensitive to the vertical temperature gradient .",
    "the steeper the gradient , the larger the pumping . as a result ,",
    "in the granular regions where the temperature gradients are larger the effect is much more pronounced ( see fig .",
    "the importance of such an effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , which shows both nlte and lte results for two feii lines using the 3d model atmosphere of the metal - poor subgiant hd140283 .",
    "we point out that emission is much more pronounced for the emergent profiles that originate above the stellar granular regions , while above the intergranular lanes the spectral line profiles are hardly modified with respect to the lte case .",
    "allowing for departures from lte produces a drastic change in the calculated spatially averaged flux of the weak feii @xmath126247.56   line in the 3d model : the absorption profile is replaced by one in emission .",
    "note , that this spectral line is taken from the set of weak feii lines that nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) assumed to be insensitive to nlte effects .",
    "however , we find that such type of lines do suffer from the above - mentioned uv pumping mechanism because all of them belong to the aforementioned category of lines , i.e. their upper levels are of odd parity and are situated above the @xmath23-level .",
    "the stronger feii @xmath125316.62   line displayed in fig .",
    "3 is also from this category .",
    "figure 3 clearly demonstrates that the stronger the spectral line the smaller the relative effect of the uv - pumping . for",
    "this line emission arises only at the core of the `` granular '' profiles .",
    "spatial averaging masks completely such an emission , but makes the flux profile weaker than in lte .",
    "it is also of interest to mention that in the 1d stellar atmosphere model departures from lte produce similar changes in the fei and feii lines but they are less pronounced than in the 3d case .",
    "for instance , the flux profile of the weak feii @xmath126247.56   line turns out to be in absorption for the 1d+nlte case .    how large could be the impact of uv - overionization and uv - overexcitation on the iron abundance determination in the star considered ?",
    "it is obvious that in order to compensate for a weakening of the emergent spectral line profiles in the stellar atmosphere model under consideration the iron abundance must be increased in comparison with the lte case .",
    "figure  4 quantifies this conclusion .",
    "it shows the lte versus nlte iron abundances derived from either fei or feii lines in the 3d and 1d stellar atmospheric models of the metal poor star hd140283 .",
    "as seen in the figure , the nlte abundance corrections for the fei lines are extremely large in the 3d model ( @xmath79 dex ) and a bit smaller in the 1d case ( @xmath80 dex ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is very important to point out that nlte effects on the iron abundance are most pronounced for the weak feii lines .",
    "the four lines used by nissen et al ( 2002 ) for their iron abundance determinations reveal strikingly large deviations from lte . on average ,",
    "the nlte abundance corrections for the feii lines increase from @xmath81 dex in the 1d case to @xmath82  dex in the 3d model .",
    "when nlte effects are taken into account we find no difference between the mean fei - based abundances obtained via the 1d and 3d models ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "therefore , when nlte effects are taken into account the fei lines formed in the 3d model are hardly sensitive to granulation inhomogeneities . however , for the feii lines the 3d abundance correction ( 3d+nlte @xmath36 1d+nlte ) is significant  that is , 0.26  dex .",
    "when the lte approximation is used the mean iron abundance obtained via spectrum synthesis of fei lines in the 3d model is lower than for the 1d case ( cf .",
    "asplund et al . 1999",
    "; nissen et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the differences between the 1d and 3d determinations depend on the lower excitation potential @xmath75 of the spectral line under consideration .",
    "they range from @xmath80 dex at @xmath84  ev to @xmath85 dex at @xmath86  ev , while the mean difference is smaller ( @xmath87 dex ) . in contrast , on average the feii lines are insensitive to 3d effects when lte is assumed .",
    "there are several discrepancies indicating that the iron abundance obtained in sect .",
    "[ fe_abund ] for the star hd 140283 can not be considered as reliable , neither in the 1d case nor in the 3d case .",
    "for example , we have ( 1 ) a divergence of the average abundances derived from both ionization stages , ( 2 ) a correlation of the abundances derived from fei lines with the lower - level excitation potential and ( 3 ) a large scatter in the abundances derived from feii lines ( particularly , the weak ones ) . the elimination of any of such discrepancies can not be simply achieved in terms of uncertainties in observed equivalent widths , oscillator strengths , inelastic electron collisional rates and photoionization cross sections .",
    "our numerical experiments show that the typical errors introduced by uncertainties in such quantities do not exceed 0.1 dex ( see shchukina and trujillo bueno 2001 ) .",
    "the iron abundance error that results from neglecting the uv haze opacity for the metal - poor star hd140283 is even smaller than 0.1 dex . in our opinion ,",
    "a reasonable possibility for explaining the reported discrepancies is to revise the stellar parameters of the subgiant hd140283 .    in this section",
    "we aim at finding the `` best - choice '' of stellar parameters for the star hd140283 , both for the nlte and lte cases .",
    "it is important to emphasize from the outset that in our nlte computations we have neglected inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms for excitation and ionization . at present , there are no reliable values for the ensuing collisional rates .",
    "the often - used classical drawin ( 1968 ) formula leads to very uncertain estimates and to a substantial overestimation of the collisional rates when detailed quantum mechanical and/or laboratory data is available , such as for li and na ( see biberman et al .",

    "2004 ) , which explains why the conclusions of gratton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have been critized .",
    "obviously , inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms would tend to reduce the nlte effects .",
    "therefore , the difference between the nlte and lte iron abundances may be considered as the maximum effect that inelastic collisions might produce . in our opinion ,",
    "the tentative conclusion of korn , shi & gehren ( 2003 ) , achieved via a 1d+nlte analysis , that hydrogen collisions might be efficient in the atmosphere of hd140283 needs to be re - investigated in the light of 3d hydrodynamical models because , as pointed out by these authors , the lower temperatures of the 3d models would alleviate their need of invoking thermalizing collisions to counterbalance photoionization .",
    "our analysis for the revision of the stellar parameter is based on the following criteria :    \\i ) the average abundances obtained from fei and feii lines have to be equal .",
    "\\ii ) the `` best choice '' solution has to give the minimum mean standard deviation ( @xmath88 ) for the abundances derived from fei and feii lines .",
    "\\iii ) abundances have to be independent of the lower excitation potential ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to revise only the metallicity and the effective temperature .",
    "the given surface gravity of the star hd140283 is reliable , since it has been obtained from accurate _",
    "_ parallaxes .",
    "figure  5 helps us to find the `` best - choice '' of stellar parameters for the star hd140283 .",
    "the left panels show the variation of the fei and feii abundances with metalicity , @xmath21 , and @xmath40 in a suitable grid of 1d model atmospheres .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that changes in @xmath21 seriously affect the fei - based abundances . however , such changes in @xmath21 are unimportant for abundance determinations from feii lines . on the other hand ,",
    "the feii - based abundances are slightly sensitive to the changes in @xmath40 , which is not the case for the abundances obtained from feii lines .",
    "in addition , the dependence on metallicity is more pronounced for fei lines , while for feii lines there is no such a variation .",
    "it is interesting to note that when lte is assumed , then only the correlation of the inferred fei abundances with @xmath21 is present .      consider first the 1d+lte modeling case for the iron lines .",
    "figure  5 ( middle panel to the _ lhs _ ) and fig .",
    "4 ( bottom panel to the _ rhs _ ) show that in this case identical abundances from both fei and feii lines could be obtained around @xmath21 close to 5700 k. in fact , our detailed analysis gives @xmath89 k and [ fe / h]@xmath90 . with these stellar parameters feii - based abundances turn out",
    "to be insignificantly scattered ( @xmath91 dex ) around the average value . however , the abundances derived from fei lines show a sensitivity to the lower - level excitation potential ( @xmath75 ) that is similar to the trend seen in the bottom panel to the _ rhs _ of fig .",
    "4 .    secondly , consider the 1d+nlte modeling case . in order to reach a good agreement between nlte abundances derived from fei and feii lines",
    "we would have to reduce the effective temperature down to @xmath92 k and to increase the stellar metallicity up to [ fe / h]@xmath93 .",
    "with such stellar parameters the @xmath75-dependence of the fei abundances vanishes .",
    "however , the abundances derived from feii lines become undesirably spread around the mean value ( @xmath94 dex ) .      in order to achieve a reasonable estimation of the `` best choice '' of stellar parameters the curves of fig .  5 ( left panels ) have to be corrected for the 3d effects of granulation inhomogeneities .",
    "this means that we need to know how the 3d abundance corrections change with [ fe / h ] , @xmath21 and @xmath40 for both the lte and nlte cases .",
    "unfortunately , a suitable grid of 3d models for several effective temperatures and metalicities similar to that provided by kurucz for the 1d case is not yet available , besides the fact that nlte computations in 3d are presently very computationally costly .",
    "however , we can try to estimate the true stellar parameters of the star hd140283 via the following strategy , which is inspired by our conclusion that 3d effects are important for the fe i lines only if lte is assumed and that 3d effects are relevant for the fe ii lines only when we allow for departures from lte .",
    "firstly , let us choose the 3d+lte modeling approach",
    ". as we have seen , if lte is assumed then the fe i lines are sensitive to the 3d effects while the fe ii lines are not .",
    "therefore , if the lte approximation is used it is much safer to revise the stellar parameters via iron abundances derived from fe ii lines .",
    "we find @xmath95 and [ fe / h]@xmath96 ( see the bottom panel to the _ rhs _ of fig .  4 ) .",
    "secondly , consider the 3d+nlte approach .",
    "it is obvious that in this case we better avoid the use of fe ii lines because we have shown that they are sensitive to both 3d and nlte effects .",
    "however , we have demonstrated also that at least for the available 3d model of the star hd140283 the nlte iron abundance derived from fe i lines is very similar to that obtained via the 1d+nlte modeling approach .",
    "for this reason , we think that we can estimate the true stellar parameters by choosing fe i lines and a 1d+nlte modeling approach .",
    "we find that the standard deviation @xmath88 minimizes at @xmath97 k and [ fe / h]@xmath98 .",
    "now the mean iron abundance turns out to be @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the derived iron abundances with @xmath75 becomes negligible .      as we have just seen , depending on the approach used for modeling the iron lines we get four `` best choice '' sets for the stellar parameters of the star hd140283 , with @xmath21 in the range @xmath100 k and [ fe / h ] between @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "how large could be the impact of such uncertainties in the stellar parameters of the star hd140283 on the determination of the oxygen abundance ? the right panels of fig .  5",
    "clarify this issue .",
    "we can see that when 1d models are used then both the oi and [ oi]-based abundances are sensitive to changes in @xmath21 , but not too much to changes in @xmath40 and/or in metallicity . the sensitivity of the nlte abundance corrections to these parameters ( @xmath40 and metallicity ) is much smaller . on average , they vary between 0.17 and 0.19 dex for oi lines , while it is negligible for the [ oi ] line ( @xmath103 dex ) .",
    "our 1d+nlte modeling of oxygen lines shows that abundances derived from oi and [ oi ] lines give the same value ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) for @xmath105 k. we now point out that among our `` best choice '' sets of stellar parameters only one has a @xmath21-value ( @xmath92 k ) which considerably deviates from that with 5650 k. such relatively low value for the effective temperature ( i.e. , @xmath92 k ) causes a large disagreement between the nlte oi and [ oi]-based abundances amounting to @xmath106 dex .",
    "moreover , as we have indicated above the set of parameters @xmath92 k and [ fe / h]@xmath107 produces an unpleasant scatter of the feii - based abundances around the mean value . in view of these factors",
    "we think reasonable to eliminate such particular set of stellar parameters .",
    "the remaining three sets of stellar parameters , i.e. @xmath108 k & [ fe / h]@xmath109 , @xmath44 k & [ fe / h]@xmath109 , and @xmath110 k & [ fe / h]@xmath111 , correspond to the case of 1d+lte modeling for both fei and feii lines , to 3d+lte modeling of feii lines , and to 3d+nlte modeling of fei lines , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that this range of effective temperatures is similar to the typical uncertainty in the determination of @xmath21 via the application of the infrared flux method .",
    "the small differences in the effective temperature implies a rather small oxygen abundance variation .",
    "in particular , our 1d+nlte oxygen abundance determination from the oi ir lines using the former set gives @xmath112 , while the latter set leads to @xmath113 .",
    "for the [ oi ] line we get @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "we must consider now how the dependencies shown for the oxygen lines in the _ rhs _ panels of fig .",
    "5 are going to be modified due to the effect of granulation inhomogeneities .",
    "as mentioned above , a major obstacle to investigate this point is the lack of a suitable grid of 3d models . in any case , this 3d issue concerns especially the [ oi ] line given its significant sensitivity to granulation inhomogeneities .",
    "according to nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) the main effect is due to differences in the continuum opacities between the 1d and 3d models . since the opacity is provided primarily by @xmath116 atoms the strength of the weak [ oi ] line turns out to be inversely proportional to electron density .",
    "in the 3d hydrodynamical model of the star hd140283 , which has been obtained assuming @xmath44 k and [ fe / h]@xmath20 , the deficit of electrons is particularly large in the cool surface layers of the granular regions , while it is less pronounced in both the intergranular plasma and in the 1d model . as a result ,",
    "the spatially averaged equivalent width of the [ oi ] line in such a 3d model increases and , consequently , the derived oxygen abundance decreases in comparison with the 1d modeling result .",
    "obviously , the 3d correction obtained in sect .  [ o_abund ] for this forbidden line assuming that the stellar parameters are @xmath44 k and [ fe / h]@xmath20 can not be used for the 3d+nlte case with lower effective temperature ( @xmath110 k ) and higher metalicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath111 ) .    as pointed out by asplund et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the deficit in the number density of electrons depends mainly on the metalicity .",
    "3d hydrodynamical simulations for higher [ fe / h ] values will have larger surface temperatures and electron densities .",
    "thus , one can expect that at [ fe / h]@xmath117 the 3d abundance correction for the [ oi ] line has to be smaller .",
    "obviously , the _ exact _ value of such corrections will have to await the development of a new 3d model for the revised stellar parameters .",
    "it should be noted that such a sensitivity to 3d effects may be assumed also for the uv lines of oh . however , the impact on 3d abundance corrections when changing the metallicity from @xmath118 to @xmath101 seems to be rather small if we suppose that the results obtained by asplund & garca prez ( 2001 ) for dwarfs can be applied to the subgiant hd140283 ( see their table 2 , which shows that the 3d effects on the uv lines of oh is @xmath119 at [ fe / h]@xmath117 and @xmath120 at [ fe / h]@xmath17 ) . the additional conclusion that follows from their table 2 is a high sensitivity of the oxygen abundances derived from the oh molecules to the metallicity of the star . as a result , a 3d model with higher metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath117 ) might bring the oxygen abundances derived from molecules ( @xmath121 for @xmath122 ) to closer agreement with the abundance derived from the oi triplet ( @xmath123 for @xmath124 k. )    an extra problem is related with observations of the [ oi ] line in the star hd140283 . according to nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) this weak line ( @xmath125 m ) is blended with a stronger @xmath126 line ( @xmath127 m ) .",
    "these authors estimated that the available equivalent width measurements have an uncertainty of @xmath128  m  .",
    "such an uncertainty is very large , because it is about 50% of the observed equivalent width , and implies an uncertainty of @xmath129  dex in the derived oxygen abundance ( fig .  5 , middle right panel ) .",
    "alternatively , in a first approximation we could neglect the sensitivity of the oi lines to the granulation inhomogeneities .",
    "furthermore , the observation errors for these lines in hd140283 are relatively small . for example , the observed equivalent widths of the oi triplet that have been published in the literature ( abia & rebolo 1989 ; tomkin et al . 1992 ; nissen et al . 2002 ; g. israelian , private communication ) , and which we have used in our investigation , differ by about @xmath130  m .",
    "their impact on the derived oxygen abundance lies in the range @xmath131  dex ( fig .  5 , middle right panel ) .",
    "it is clear that the oi lines seem to be the most reliable lines for deriving the oxygen abundance in the star hd140283 .",
    "therefore , when the stellar parameters are revised neglecting 3d and nlte effects for the iron lines , and when the oxygen abundance derived from the oi lines is corrected for nlte effects , then the mean value of the oxygen - to - iron ratio seems to be [ o / fe]@xmath132 at [ fe / h]=@xmath133 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the quasi - linear trend of [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] obtained by nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) using standard 1d modeling . however , the key point to keep in mind is that a 3d+nlte modeling of the oi ir triplet ( using the 3d+nlte stellar parameters derived from the fei lines ) would give [ o / fe]@xmath134 at [ fe / h]=@xmath101 . obviously , the analysis of a single metal - poor star is not enough to opt for one of the following two possibilities : ( a ) a linear rise in the [ o / fe ] ratio vs. metallicity ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "11 of israelian et al . 2001 ) or ( b ) a plateau between 0.4 and 0.5 dex in the metallicity range -3@xmath14[fe / h]@xmath15 . and",
    "[ fe / h]=@xmath118 ) the nlte oxygen abundance ( @xmath135 ) derived from the oi ir triplet and the nlte fei - based iron abundance ( @xmath136 ) leads to a small oxygen - to - iron ratio ( [ o / fe]@xmath137 dex ) .",
    "moreover , there is no overabundance of oxygen at all if one uses the [ oi]-based abundance .",
    "it is also of interest to mention that in our preliminary study ( see shchukina et al .",
    "2003 ) we obtained a slightly larger value for [ o / fe ] because we used a smaller number of fei lines .",
    "] however , we think that our investigation indicates the `` road to be taken '' towards the resolution of the problem .",
    "we have derived the solar oxygen abundance from the oi ir triplet using asplund s et al .",
    "( 2000 ) 3d hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere and a nlte modeling approach .",
    "we find @xmath138 , which is in good agreement with the determinations of allende prieto et al .",

    "( 2003 ) and asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . actually , if for the oi ir triplet we use the same oscillator strengths adopted by asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we then obtain a value very similar to that reported by them ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) .    in agreement with previous investigations",
    ", we confirm that lte synthesis of fei lines in the 3d hydrodynamical model of this star gives flux profiles significantly different from those obtained in a 1d model for the same stellar parameters .",
    "however , when the lte approximation is used for the synthesis of feii lines we find negligible differences between the 1d and 3d cases .    the differences between the iron abundances obtained from fei lines when assuming lte in the 1d and 3d models of the star hd140283 turn out to depend on the lower excitation potential of the spectral line under consideration .",
    "the nlte abundance corrections for fei lines are significant , especially for the low - excitation lines in the 3d model .",
    "\\(2 ) contrary to a generally accepted belief , the feii lines turn out to be significantly affected by nlte effects .",
    "in particular , a full nlte modeling should be carried out for the feii lines with upper levels of odd parity starting from @xmath23 , and especially the weaker lines .      for the oi ir triplet",
    "the nlte correction of the oxygen abundance in the 1d and 3d models is practically the same and less than 0.2 dex .",
    "such a nlte correction is negligible for the [ oi ] line .",
    "we have confirmed that the mean value of the oxygen abundance derived from the oi ir lines is insensitive to 3d effects , while such effects reduce the abundance derived from the [ oi ] line by @xmath85 dex .    with the here presented nlte calculations for fe and o , both the 1d and 3d models lead to inconsistencies in the iron and oxygen abundance determinations .",
    "the discrepancies in the derived iron and oxygen abundances can not be removed by taking into account nlte and/or 3d effects . this result has led us to investigate whether these discrepancies can be resolved by a modification of the stellar parameters of the star hd140283 .",
    "we have shown that previous studies may have underestimated the metallicity of this star and overestimated its effective temperature .",
    "we find [ fe / h]@xmath141 ( instead of [ fe / h]@xmath142 ) and @xmath110 ( instead of @xmath44 ) . with these new stellar parameters the iron and oxygen abundances in the star",

    "besides the reported nlte effects for the fe ii lines , our main conclusion here is that the metalicity of this type of metal - poor stars might well be significantly larger than previously thought .",

    "<S> this paper presents the results of a detailed theoretical investigation of the impact of non - lte effects and of granulation inhomogeneities on the derived iron and oxygen abundances in the metal - poor halo subgiant hd140283 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on both the ` classical ' one - dimensional ( 1d ) stellar atmosphere models and on the new generation of three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamical models . </S>",
    "<S> the non - lte calculations presented here have been carried out without inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if non - lte effects are taken into account when synthetizing the fe i spectrum in both type of models , then the derived iron abundance turns out to be very similar in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent spectral line profiles in both models are very much weaker in non - lte than in lte because the uv overionization mechanism produces a very strong underpopulation of the fe i levels , in particular in the granular regions of the 3d model . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the non - lte effects on the derived iron abundance are very important , amounting to @xmath0 dex and to @xmath1 dex in the 3d and 1d cases , respectively . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we find that non - lte and 3d effects have to be taken into account for a reliable determination of the iron abundance from weak fe ii lines , because the significant overexcitation of their upper levels in the granular regions tend to produce emission features . as a result such fe ii lines are weaker than in lte and the abundance correction amounts to @xmath2 dex for the 3d case .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive also the oxygen - to - iron abundance ratio in the metal - poor star hd140283 by using the oi triplet at 77725    and the forbidden [ oi ] line at 6300  . </S>",
    "<S> our 3d results for the oxygen abundance confirm the values reported in some recent investigations . while the oxygen abundance derived from the oi ir triplet is not very sensitive to the presence of granulation inhomogeneities , such 3d effects amount to @xmath3  dex for the [ oi ] line . </S>",
    "<S> the non - lte abundance correction for the oi ir triplet turns out to be @xmath4  dex , approximately .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , when both non - lte and 3d effects are taken into account there still remains significant discrepancies in the iron abundances derived from fe i and fe ii lines , as well as in the oxygen abundances inferred from the oi and [ oi ] lines . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the discrepancies could be due to uncertainties in the stellar parameters of this metal poor star . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that adopting @xmath5 k ( instead of @xmath6 k ) and [ fe / h]@xmath7 ( instead of [ fe / h]@xmath8 ) substantially reduces the discrepancies in the abundances of iron and oxygen inferred from several spectral lines . under such circumstances we find [ o / fe]@xmath9 at [ fe / h]=@xmath10 . obviously , our tentative conclusion that the metalicity of this type of metal - poor stars is significantly larger than previously thought may have far - reaching implications in stellar astrophysics . </S>"
