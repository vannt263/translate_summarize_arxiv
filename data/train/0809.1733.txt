    "in refs . for the dirac - yang - mills system derived from qcd - lagrangian an unique family of compatible nonperturbative solutions was found and explored , which could pretend to describing confinement of two quarks .",
    "the applications of the family to the description of both the heavy quarkonia spectra and a number of properties of pions , kaons , @xmath9- and @xmath10-mesons showed that the confinement mechanism is qualitatively the same for both light mesons and heavy quarkonia . at this moment",
    "it can be described in the following way .",
    "two main physical reasons underlie linear confinement in the mechanism under discussion .",
    "the first one is that gluon exchange between quarks is realized with the propagator different from the photon - like one and existence and form of such a propagator is a _",
    "direct _ consequence of the unique confining nonperturbative solutions of the yang - mills equations .",
    "the second reason is that , owing to the structure of mentioned propagator , quarks mainly emit and interchange the soft gluons so the gluon condensate ( a classical gluon field ) between quarks basically consists of soft gluons ( for more details see refs . ) but , because of that any gluon also emits gluons ( still softer ) , the corresponding gluon concentrations rapidly become huge and form a linear confining magnetic colour field of enormous strengths , which leads to the confinement of quarks .",
    "this is by virtue of the fact that just magnetic part of the mentioned propagator is responsible for a larger portion of gluon concentrations at large distances since the magnetic part has stronger infrared singularities than the electric one . under the circumstances physically nonlinearity of the yang - mills equations effectively vanishes so the latter possess the unique nonperturbative confining solutions of the abelian - like form ( with the values in cartan subalgebra of su(3)-lie algebra ) which describe the gluon condensate under consideration .",
    "moreover , since the overwhelming majority of gluons is soft they can not leave hadron ( meson ) until some gluons obtain additional energy ( due to an external reason ) to rush out .",
    "so we also deal with confinement of gluons .",
    "the approach under discussion equips us with the explicit wave functions for every two quarks ( meson or quarkonium ) .",
    "the wave functions are parametrized by a set of real constants @xmath11 describing the mentioned _ nonperturbative _ confining su(3)-gluonic field ( the gluon condensate ) , and they are _ nonperturbative _ modulo square integrable solutions of the dirac equation in the above confining su(3)-field and also depend on @xmath12 , the reduced mass of the current masses of quarks forming meson .",
    "it is clear that under the given approach just constants @xmath13 determine all properties of any meson ( quarkonium ) , i. e. , the approach directly appeals to quark and gluonic degrees of freedom as should be according to the first principles of qcd .",
    "also it is clear that the constants mentioned should be extracted from experimental data .",
    "such a program has been to a certain extent advanced in refs . .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to continue obtaining estimates for @xmath11 for concrete mesons starting from experimental data on spectroscopy of one or another meson .",
    "we here consider charged pions and kaons and their leptonic decays @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stands for any meson from @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "of course , when conducting our considerations we shall rely on the standard quark model ( sqm ) based on su(3)-flavor symmetry ( see , e. g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so in accordance with sqm @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 respectively .    under the circumstances section 2",
    "contains main relations underlying our approach .",
    "section 3 is devoted to computing the electric form factor , the root - mean - square radius @xmath18 and the magnetic moment of the mesons under consideration in an explicit analytic form while section 4 gives an explicit analytic expression of the weak axial form factor for those mesons .",
    "results of sections 3 and 4 are used in section 5 for obtaining estimates for parameters of the confining su(3)-gluonic field for the mesons under discussion .",
    "section 6 employs the obtained parameters of su(3)-gluonic field to get the corresponding estimates for such characteristics of the mentioned field as gluon concentrations , electric and magnetic colour field strengths at the scales of the mesons in question . in section",
    "7 results of previous sections are applied to the problem of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "section 8 explores a possible connection of the results obtained with a phenomenological string - like picture of confinement while section 9 is devoted to discussion and concluding remarks .    at last , appendices a and b contain the detailed description of main building blocks for meson wave functions in the approach under discussion , respectively : eigenspinors of the euclidean dirac operator on 2-sphere @xmath19 and radial parts for the modulo square integrable solutions of dirac equation in the confining su(3)-yang - mills field .",
    "further we shall deal with the metric of the flat minkowski spacetime @xmath20 that we write down ( using the ordinary set of local spherical coordinates @xmath21 for the spatial part ) in the form @xmath22 besides , we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .    throughout the paper",
    "we employ the heaviside - lorentz system of units with @xmath27 , unless explicitly stated otherwise , so the gauge coupling constant @xmath28 and the strong coupling constant @xmath29 are connected by relation @xmath30 .",
    "further , we shall denote by @xmath31 the set of the modulo square integrable complex functions on any manifold @xmath32 furnished with an integration measure , then @xmath33 will be the @xmath34-fold direct product of @xmath31 endowed with the obvious scalar product while @xmath35 and @xmath36 stand , respectively , for hermitian and complex conjugation .",
    "our choice of dirac @xmath37-matrices conforms to the so - called standard representation and is the same as in ref .",
    ". at last @xmath38 means the tensorial product of matrices and @xmath39 is the unit @xmath40 matrix so that , e.g. , we have @xmath41 for any dirac @xmath37-matrix @xmath42 and so forth .    when calculating we apply the relations @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    finally , for the necessary estimates we shall employ the @xmath47-component ( volumetric energy density ) of the energy - momentum tensor for a su(3)-yang - mills field which should be written in the chosen system of units in the form @xmath48",
    "as was mentioned above , our considerations shall be based on the unique family of compatible nonperturbative solutions for the dirac - yang - mills system ( derived from qcd - lagrangian ) studied at the whole length in refs . .",
    "referring for more details to those references , let us briefly describe and specify only the relations necessary to us in the present paper .",
    "one part of the mentioned family is presented by the unique nonperturbative confining solution of the su(3)-yang - mills equations for gluonic field @xmath49 ( @xmath50 are the known gell - mann matrices , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) and looks as follows @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 with the real constants @xmath57 parametrizing the family . the word _ unique _ should be understood in the strict mathematical sense .",
    "in fact in ref .",
    "@xcite the following theorem was proved :    _ the unique exact spherically symmetric ( nonperturbative ) solutions ( i.e. depending only on @xmath58 ) of su(3)-yang - mills equations in minkowski spacetime consist of the family of ( 3)_.    it should be noted that solution ( 3 ) was found early in ref . @xcite but its uniqueness was proved just in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . besides , in ref . @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) it was shown that the above unique confining solutions ( 3 ) satisfy the so - called wilson confinement criterion @xcite .",
    "up to now nobody contested this result so if we want to describe interaction between quarks by spherically symmetric su(3)-fields then they can be only the ones from the above theorem .    as has been repeatedly explained in refs . , parameters @xmath59 of solution ( 3 )",
    "are inessential for physics in question and we can consider @xmath60 . obviously we have @xmath61 which reflects the fact that for any matrix @xmath62 from su(3)-lie algebra we have @xmath63 . also , as has been repeatedly discussed by us earlier ( see , e. g. , refs . ) , from the above form it is clear that the solution ( 3 ) is a configuration describing the electric coulomb - like colour field ( components @xmath64 ) and the magnetic colour field linear in @xmath58 ( components @xmath65 ) and we wrote down the solution ( 3 ) in the combinations that are just needed further to insert into the dirac equation ( 4 ) .    for the sake of completeness one should note that the similar unique confining solutions exist for all semisimple and non - semisimple compact lie groups , in particular , for su(@xmath66 ) with @xmath67 and u(@xmath66 ) with @xmath68 .",
    "explicit form of solutions , e.g. , for su(@xmath66 ) with @xmath69 can be found in ref . @xcite but it should be emphasized that components linear in @xmath58 always represent the magnetic colour field in all the mentioned solutions .",
    "another part of the compatible nonperturbative solutions for the su(3)- dirac - yang - mills system is given by the _",
    "unique _ nonperturbative modulo square integrable solutions of the dirac equation in the confining su(3)-field of ( 3 ) @xmath70 with the four - dimensional dirac spinors @xmath71 representing the @xmath72th colour component of the meson , so @xmath73 may describe relative motion ( relativistic bound states ) of two quarks in mesons and the mentioned dirac equation looks as follows @xmath74 where hamiltonian @xmath75 is @xmath76\\ ] ] @xmath77 with the gauge coupling constant @xmath28 while @xmath12 is a mass parameter and one should consider it to be the reduced mass which is equal , _ e. g. _ , for quarkonia , to half the current mass of quarks forming a quarkonium .    then the unique nonperturbative modulo square integrable solutions of ( 4 ) are ( with pauli matrix @xmath78 , for more details see refs . ) @xmath79 with the 2d eigenspinor @xmath80 of the euclidean dirac operator @xmath81 on the unit sphere @xmath19 , while the coordinate @xmath58 stands for the distance between quarks .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath82 is discussed in appendix a. we can call the quantity @xmath83 relative energy of @xmath72th colour component of meson ( while @xmath84 is wave function of a stationary state for @xmath72th colour component ) but we can see that if we want to interpret ( 4 ) as equation for eigenvalues of the relative motion energy , i. e. , to rewrite it in the form @xmath85 with @xmath86 then we should put @xmath87 for any @xmath72 so that @xmath88 . under this situation ,",
    "if a meson is composed of quarks @xmath89 with different flavours then the energy spectrum of the meson will be given by @xmath90 with the current quark masses @xmath91 ( rest energies ) of the corresponding quarks .",
    "on the other hand for determination of @xmath83 the following quadratic equation can be obtained @xmath92\\omega_j^2- 2(\\lambda_j - gb_j)g^2a_jb_j\\,\\omega_j+ [ ( \\lambda_j - gb_j)^2-(n_j+\\alpha_j)^2]g^2b_j^2- \\mu_0 ^ 2(n_j+\\alpha_j)^2=0\\ > ,   \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] that yields ( at @xmath93 ) @xmath94 @xmath95    where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , while @xmath102 are the eigenvalues of euclidean dirac operator @xmath81 on unit sphere with @xmath103 . it should be noted that in the papers we used the ansatz ( 6 ) with the factor @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 but then the dirac equation ( 4 ) would look as @xmath106 and in equation ( 7 ) the second summand would have the plus sign while the first summand in numerator of ( 8) would have the minus sign . in the papers we returned to the conventional form of writing dirac equation and",
    "this slightly modified the equations ( 7)(8 ) . in the given paper",
    "we conform to the same prescription as in refs . .    in line with the above we",
    "should have @xmath107 in energy spectrum @xmath90 for any meson ( quarkonium ) and this at once imposes two conditions on parameters @xmath108 when choosing some experimental value for @xmath109 at the given current quark masses @xmath110 .",
    "the general form of the radial parts of ( 6 ) is considered in appendix b. within the given paper we need only of the radial parts of ( 6 ) at @xmath111 ( the ground state ) that are [ see ( b.5 ) ] @xmath112 @xmath113 with @xmath114 while @xmath115 is determined from the normalization condition @xmath116 .",
    "consequently , we shall gain that @xmath117 at any @xmath118 and , as a result , the solutions of ( 6 ) may describe relativistic bound states ( mesons ) with the energy ( mass ) spectrum @xmath109 .",
    "it is useful to specify the nonrelativistic limit ( when @xmath119 ) for spectrum ( 8) . for that one should replace @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and , expanding ( 8) in @xmath124 , we shall get @xmath125 @xmath126 + \\left[\\frac{\\lambda_j g^2a_jb_j}{\\hbar(n_j+|\\lambda_j|)^2}\\ , \\mp\\mu_0\\frac{g^3b_ja_j^2f(n_j,\\lambda_j)}{\\hbar^3(n_j+|\\lambda_j|)^{7}}\\right ] z\\,+o(z^2)\\>,\\eqno(10)\\ ] ] where @xmath127 .    as is seen from ( 10 ) , at @xmath119 the contribution of linear magnetic colour field ( parameters @xmath128 ) to spectrum really vanishes and",
    "spectrum in essence becomes the purely nonrelativistic coulomb one ( modulo the rest energy ) .",
    "also it is clear that when @xmath129 , @xmath130 .    at last",
    ", one should specify the weak coupling limit of ( 8) , i.e. , the case @xmath131 . as is not complicated to see from ( 8) , @xmath132 when @xmath131 .",
    "but then quantities @xmath133 and wave functions of ( 9 ) cease to be the modulo square integrable ones at @xmath134 , i.e. , they cease to describe relativistic bound states . accordingly",
    ", this means that equation ( 8) does not make physical meaning at @xmath134 .",
    "we may seemingly use ( 8) with various combinations of signes ( @xmath135 ) before second summand in numerators of ( 8) but , due to ( 10 ) , it is reasonable to take all signs equal to plus which is our choice within the paper .",
    "besides , as is not complicated to see , radial parts in nonrelativistic limit have the behaviour of form @xmath136 , which allows one to call quantum number @xmath137 angular momentum for @xmath72th colour component though angular momentum is not conserved in the field ( 3 ) .",
    "so for meson ( quarkonium ) under consideration we should put all @xmath138 .",
    "finally it should be noted that spectrum ( 8) is degenerated owing to degeneracy of eigenvalues for the euclidean dirac operator @xmath81 on the unit sphere @xmath19 .",
    "namely , each eigenvalue of @xmath81 @xmath140 , has multiplicity @xmath141 so we has @xmath141 eigenspinors orthogonal to each other .",
    "ad referendum we need eigenspinors corresponding to @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) so here is their explicit form [ see @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 with the coefficient @xmath147 ( for more details see appendix a ) .",
    "within the present paper we shall use relations ( 8) at @xmath148 so energy ( mass ) of mesons under consideration is given by @xmath149 with @xmath150 for any @xmath151 whereas @xmath152 and , as a consequence , the corresponding meson ( quarkonium ) wave functions of ( 6 ) are represented by ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "it is evident for employing the above relations we have to assign some values to quark masses and gauge coupling constant @xmath28 . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , at present the current quark masses necessary to us are restricted to intervals @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , so we take @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 . under the circumstances ,",
    "the reduced mass @xmath12 of ( 5 ) will be @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",
    "as to gauge coupling constant @xmath161 , it should be noted that recently some attempts have been made to generalize the standard formula for @xmath162 $ ] ( @xmath163 is number of quark flavours ) holding true at the momentum transfer @xmath164 to the whole interval @xmath165 .",
    "we shall employ one such a generalization used in refs .",

    "we can define electromagnetic current @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",

    "on the other hand , we can directly calculate @xmath18 in accordance with the standard quantum mechanics rules as @xmath203 and the result will be the same as in ( 16 ) .",
    "so we should not call @xmath18 of ( 16 ) the _ charge _ radius of meson ( quarkonium) it is just the radius of meson ( quarkonium ) determined by the wave functions of ( 6 ) ( at @xmath148 ) with respect to strong interaction , i.e. , radius of confinement .",
    "now we should notice the expression ( 15 ) to depend on 3-vector @xmath189 . to rewrite it in the form holding true for any 4-vector @xmath204 ,",
    "let us remind that according to general considerations ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "unique _ modulo square integrable solutions of dirac ( schrdinger ) equation in the coulomb field [ condensate of huge number of ( virtual ) photons ] , i. e. , one employs the _ unique _ compatible nonperturbative solutions of the maxwell - dirac ( schrdinger ) system directly derived from qed - lagrangian to describe positronium ( or hydrogen atom ) spectrum .    to summarize , from the point of view of our approach both potential and string - like pictures of confinement arise only as some _ effective _ models derived in a certain way from the more fundamental theory based on exact solution ( 3 ) of su(3)-yang - mills equations .",
    "this conclusion is in concordance with the preliminary one obtained in ref .",
    "as is seen from tables 78 , at the characteristic scales of charged pions and kaons the gluon concentrations are huge and the corresponding fields ( electric and magnetic colour ones ) can be considered to be the classical ones with enormous strengths .",
    "the part @xmath286 of gluon concentration @xmath34 connected with the coulomb electric colour field is decreasing faster than @xmath287 , the part of @xmath34 related to the linear magnetic colour field , and at large distances @xmath287 becomes dominant .",
    "it should be emphasized that in fact the gluon concentrations are much greater than the estimates given in tables 78 because the latter are the estimates for maximal possible gluon frequencies , i.e. for maximal possible gluon impulses ( under the concrete situation of charged pions and kaons ) . as was mentioned in section 1 ,",
    "the overwhelming majority of gluons between quarks is soft , i. e. , with frequencies much less than @xmath288 @xmath289 ev , for example , in the case of pions , so the corresponding concentrations are much greater than those in tables 78 .",
    "the given picture is in concordance with the one obtained in refs . .",
    "as a result , the confinement mechanism developed in refs . and described early in section 1 is also confirmed by the considerations of the present paper .",
    "it should be noted , however , that our results are of a preliminary character which is readily apparent , for example , from that the current quark masses ( as well as the gauge coupling constant @xmath28 ) used in computation are known only within the certain limits and we can expect similar limits for the magnitudes discussed in the paper so it is necessary further specification of the parameters for the confining su(3)-gluonic field in charged pions and kaons which can be obtained , for instance , by calculating the width of decay @xmath290 with the help of wave function of @xmath291-meson discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and so on .",
    "we hope to continue analysing the given problems elsewhere .",
    "the results of present paper as well as the ones of refs .",
    "allow one to speak about that the confinement mechanism elaborated in refs .",
    "gives new possibilities for considering many old problems of hadronic ( meson ) physics ( such as nonperturbative computation of decay constants , masses and radii of mesons , chiral symmetry breaking and so forth ) from the first principles of qcd immediately appealing to the quark and gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is possible because the given confinement mechanism is based on the unique family of compatible nonperturbative solutions for the dirac - yang - mills system directly derived from qcd - lagrangian and , as a result , the approach is itself nonperturbative , relativistic from the outset , admits self - consistent nonrelativistic limit and may be employed for any meson ( quarkonium ) .",
    "the given paper to a certain degree summarizes studying nonet of pseudoscalar mesons realized in refs . within the framework of our approach",
    "and we can ascertain the fact that , on the whole , this nonet can be described from the unified point of view of our confinement mechanism . in line with the above ,",
    "obviously , one should now pass on to vector mesons ( @xmath183 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 ... ) and also to the light scalar mesons whose nature has been controversial over 30 years @xcite .",
    "as is clear from section 2 and appendices a , b , there exists a large number of relativistic bound states in the confining su(3)-gluonic field ( 3 ) so all the mentioned mesons can probably correspond to some of those states and be described by their own sets of parameters @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 of solution ( 3 ) .",
    "finally , one should think about possible ways to extend the approach over baryons , in particular , over nucleons .",
    "we here represent some results about eigenspinors of the euclidean dirac operator on two - sphere @xmath19 employed in the main part of the paper .",
    "when separating variables in the dirac equation ( 4 ) there naturally arises the euclidean dirac operator @xmath81 on the unit two - dimensional sphere @xmath19 and we should know its eigenvalues with the corresponding eigenspinors .",
    "such a problem also arises in the black hole theory while describing the so - called twisted spinors on schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes and it was analysed in refs .",
    ", so we can use the results obtained therein for our aims .",
    "let us adduce the necessary relations .    the eigenvalue equation for corresponding spinors @xmath238 may look as follows @xmath294    as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the natural form of @xmath81 ( arising within applications ) in local coordinates @xmath295 on the unit sphere @xmath19 looks as @xmath296=\\ ] ] @xmath297 with the ordinary pauli matrices @xmath298 so that @xmath299 .",
    "the equation ( a.1 ) was explored in refs .",
    "spectrum of @xmath300 consists of the numbers @xmath301 with multiplicity @xmath141 of each one , where @xmath302 .",
    "let us introduce the number @xmath303 such that @xmath304 and the corresponding number @xmath305 so @xmath306",
    ". then the conforming eigenspinors of operator @xmath81 are @xmath307 with the coefficient @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "these spinors form an orthonormal basis in @xmath310 and are subject to the normalization condition @xmath311 further , owing to the relation @xmath299 we , obviously , have @xmath312    as to functions @xmath313 then they can be chosen by miscellaneous ways , for instance , as follows ( see , e. g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath314 @xmath315 with the orthogonality relation at @xmath316 fixed @xmath317 it should be noted that square of @xmath81 is @xmath318 while laplacian on the unit sphere is @xmath319 so the relation ( a.8 ) is a particular case of the so - called weitzenbck - lichnerowicz formulas ( see refs .",
    "then from ( a.1 ) it follows @xmath320 and , when using the ansatz @xmath321 , @xmath322 , the equation @xmath320 turns into @xmath323 @xmath324 wherefrom all the above results concerning spectrum of @xmath81 can be derived @xcite .",
    "when calculating the functions @xmath325 directly , to our mind , it is the most convenient to use the integral expression @xcite    @xmath326 @xmath327 and the symmetry relations ( @xmath328 ) @xmath329 @xmath330 in particular @xmath331 @xmath332      if @xmath334 then @xmath143 and from ( a.3 ) it follows that @xmath335 , @xmath336 and we need the functions @xmath337 that are easily evaluated with the help of ( a.11)(a.13 ) so the eigenspinors for @xmath338 are @xmath339 while for @xmath340 the conforming spinors are @xmath341 with the coefficient @xmath342 .",
    "it is clear that ( a.14)(a.15 ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath145 @xmath343 so the relation ( a.5 ) is easily verified at @xmath139 .    in studying vector mesons and excited states of heavy quarkonia eigenspinors with @xmath344",
    "may also be useful .",
    "then @xmath345 , @xmath346 and we need the functions @xmath347 that can be evaluated with the help of ( a.11)(a.13 ) .",
    "computation gives rise to @xmath348 @xmath349 @xmath350 @xmath351 and according to ( a.3 ) this entails eigenspinors with @xmath352 in the form @xmath353 @xmath354 with @xmath355 , while eigenspinors with @xmath356 are obtained in accordance with relation ( a.5 ) .",
    "we here adduce the explicit form for the radial parts of meson wave functions from ( 6 ) . at @xmath111",
