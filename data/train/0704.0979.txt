    "what energy is the transition point of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) and extragalactic cosmic rays ( egcrs ) in cosmic ray spectrum is an intriguing problem in cosmic ray astrophysics .",
    "the observed spectrum of cosmic rays , over more than 12 orders of magnitude in energy , can be described by a power - law shape with several spectral breaks @xcite .",
    "the spectral breaks are interpreted as the transition points of sources to mainly contribute to the observed flux of cosmic rays .",
    "a spectral break at @xmath5 ev , so - called _ knee _ , has been thought of as the appearance of a maximum acceleration energy of protons at energetic objects in our galaxy , like supernova remnants .    at @xmath0 ev ,",
    "a spectral dip , called _ ankle _ , has been observed .",
    "traditionally , the ankle has been interpreted as a transition point from gcrs with a steep spectrum ( @xmath6 ) to egcrs with a harder spectrum ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is partly because cosmic rays above @xmath8ev could not be confined in the galaxy by the galactic magnetic field and their arrival distribution is highly isotropic .",
    "we call this traditional scenario _ ankle - transition scenario _ throughout this paper . in this scenario",
    ", it is an open problem how gcrs are accelerated up to @xmath8ev in our galaxy . on the other hand , it has been suggested recently that extragalactic protons with a steep injection spectrum ( @xmath9 ) can reproduce the ankle as a spectral dip due to bethe - heitler pair - creation with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons @xcite .",
    "this scenario , called _ proton - dip scenario _ throughout this paper , requires extragalactic protons at least down to @xmath10 ev . in the proton - dip scenario , the _ second knee _ , which is another spectral break at @xmath11 ev ,",
    "is interpreted as a transition point from gcrs to egcrs .",
    "it is an intriguing problem for the determination of cosmic ray origin which scenario is favored .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the two scenarios based on the energy spectrum of cosmic rays in observations .",
    "one of the key clues to determine the transition point is cosmic ray composition . in the ankle - transition scenario ,",
    "the composition of gcrs at @xmath0ev is expected to be dominated by heavy nuclei because of their capability of accelerating up to such high energy , while proton - dominated composition is required in the proton - dip scenario .",
    "thus , composition measurements may provide us with useful information on the transition scenarios . however , the results of composition measurements are difficult to constrain transition scenarios because the uncertainty of hadronic interaction models in the simulations of extensive air showers obstructs the accurate determination of the composition @xcite .    in this study , we focus on another key element , cosmogenic neutrinos , which are generated by photopion production between ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) propagating in intergalactic space and cosmic background photons , and through the successive decay of producing pions and muons .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos are a definite probe of egcrs .",
    "the estimations of the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos have been performed since the discovery of the cmb @xcite . a recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that cosmogenic neutrinos , coupled with uhecr results , would provide a sufficient description of the properties of uhecr sources .",
    "cosmic background radiation with the energy higher than the cmb ( e.g. , infrared ( ir ) , optical , ultraviolet ( uv ) ) can significantly contribute to the total flux of cosmogenic neutrinos because there is a large number of uhecrs which can generate neutrinos by interactions with such higher energy photons though the number of such photons is much smaller than the cmb @xcite .",
    "recent progress in the observations of high - redshift universe allows constructing detailed models of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ir to uv background ( ir / uv below ) radiation @xcite",
    "@xcite discussed the neutrino flux using the sed model constructed by ref .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite considered the propagation of uhe protons and estimated the resultant flux of cosmogenic neutrinos .",
    "based on this work , it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that cosmogenic neutrinos might be a key clue for determining the transition energy , but detailed discussions were not performed . on the other hand ,",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite estimated the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos on the assumptions of both a pure proton and mixed composition models .    motivated by these studies",
    ", we discuss whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a clue to judge which transition scenario is favored in detail in this study .",
    "we calculate the spectra of cosmogenic neutrinos following the two transition scenarios for this purpose for plausible physical parameter sets .",
    "since the neutrino fluxes depend on several physical parameters , like the maximum acceleration energy of uhecrs , the minimum energy of egcrs , the spectral shape of uhecrs , and the cosmological evolution of uhecr sources , we also investigate the parameter dependence of the neutrino fluxes and the capability of distinguishing between the two transition scenarios .",
    "we adopt an ir / uv background model other than a model used in refs .",
    "the neutrino fluxes are normalized by the fluxes and spectral shapes of accompanying uhecrs obtained in observations . for simplicity ,",
    "extragalactic magnetic field is neglected .",
    "the composition of egcrs are assumed to be purely protons in this study .",
    "egcr composition is an interesting problem in itself .",
    "the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) reported that the composition of cosmic rays above @xmath10ev is dominated by protons as a result of @xmath12 , the averaged depth of the shower maximum , measurement @xcite .",
    "a recent result by pierre auger observatory ( pao ) is consistent with the hires result within systematic uncertainty @xcite . on the other hand , studies of muon content in the extensive air shower ,",
    "another observable for uhecr composition , indicate a significant fraction of heavy nuclei above @xmath8ev @xcite .",
    "the accurate interpretation of these composition measurements is difficult because of our poor knowledge of hadronic interactions at ultra - high - energy , as mentioned above .",
    "the pao also reports the positional correlation between the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays above @xmath13ev and nearby active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite .",
    "if these agns are really the sources of the observed events , this fact implies the highest energy cosmic rays are dominated by protons because of small deflections by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "this implication is independent of the composition measurements .",
    "thus , an assumption that egcrs are dominated by protons up to the highest energies is reasonable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ method ] , we explain our calculation method of cosmogenic neutrino fluxes in detail . in section",
    "[ results ] , we address our results and discuss the detectability of cosmogenic neutrinos taking neutrino oscillation into account . in section [ discussion ] , several uncertainties on the neutrino flux are discussed .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , our calculation method of the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos is explained .",
    "the neutrino flux can be obtained by calculating the number of neutrinos produced by propagating protons injected from a source , and then by integrating such neutrinos over all sources .",
    "we explain the propagation of uhe protons and their interactions with cosmic background photons in section [ method_prop ] . in section [ method_neutrinos ] ,",
    "our treatment of neutrino production is described .",
    "then , we represent uhecr source models to calculate the total neutrino flux in section [ method_integration ] .",
    "protons propagating in intergalactic space interact with cosmic background photons and lose their energies through particle productions @xcite .",
    "they also lose their energies adiabatically due to the cosmic expansion since they propagate over cosmological distance .",
    "we consider two interactions with cosmic background photons : photopion production and bethe - heitler pair creation , and adiabatic energy - loss .    for cosmic background photons ,",
    "we take into account not only the cmb photons but also ir / uv background photons .",
    "background photons with the energies higher than the cmb photons allow protons with the energies lower than the threshold of photopion production with the cmb to generate neutrinos .",
    "thus , they increase the neutrino flux significantly while they do not change uhecr spectrum because of the smaller number density of ir / uv photons compared with the cmb @xcite .",
    "we adopt the best - fit model of the sed of ir / uv background photons calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "photopion production is the most essential process in this study .",
    "this process is treated stochastically .",
    "the mean free path of photopion production for a proton with energy @xmath14 , in an isotropic photon field , @xmath15 , is calculated as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19^{-1}$ ] .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the proton mass , the neutral pion mass , the speed of light , the velocity of the proton in the unit of the speed of light , the energy of cosmic background photons , and the lorentz invariant energy squared , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is the total cross section of photopion production and @xmath27 is the differential number density of cosmic background photons .",
    "@xmath26 is calculated by geant4 , a monte - carlo simulation tool - kit which can simulate photomeson productions @xcite .",
    "the geant4 can well reproduce the experimental total cross section of photopion production .",
    "the mean free paths in intergalactic space are calculated and used for every @xmath28 up to @xmath29 .",
    "the mean free paths at several redshifts @xmath30 are shown in fig.[fig : mfp ] .",
    "the mean free path at @xmath31 rapidly decreases above @xmath32ev where the channel of interactions with the cmb opens , which makes sharply cosmic ray spectrum steepening , so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) steepening @xcite . at @xmath31 , the minimum length of the mean free path @xmath33 is about 4 mpc .",
    "the interaction points of propagating protons are determined by a method used in ref.@xcite , based on @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "the inelasticity of photopion production , @xmath35 , is approximated by a conventional method as @xmath36/2 $ ] for single pion production , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the mass of the cosmic ray after an interaction ( proton or neutron ) , the pion mass generated in the reaction , respectively .",
    "for multipion production ( see section [ method_neutrinos ] ) , we approximately adopt this formula by replacing @xmath38 with the total mass of pions .",
    "this assumption does not almost affect the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos shown in section [ results ] .",
    "a typical inelasticity is 0.23 at @xmath39 , which is the lorentz invariant energy squared at the delta resonance in the total cross section of photopion production .",
    "cosmic background photons also make protons lose their energies through bethe - heitler pair creation , @xmath40 .",
    "fig.[fig : mfp ] also shows the energy - loss lengths of this process which are calculated following an analytical fitting function given by ref.@xcite .",
    "this energy - loss process can be treated in a continuous energy - loss approximation since its inelasticity is very small ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "since the energy - loss length is much shorter than the interaction length of photopion production for ir / uv photons at high - redshift universe , neutrino production related to ir / uv photons mainly occurs at about less than z=1 .",
    "the energy - loss rate of protons with energy @xmath14 due to the cosmic expansion is expressed as @xmath42^{1/2 } e,\\ ] ] where @xmath43cdm cosmology with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is assumed .",
    "we also treat this process as continuous process during propagation .",
    "the spectra of uhe protons and cosmogenic neutrinos are calculated as follows : first , we consider protons with @xmath46-@xmath47ev ejected from a source .",
    "this energy range is divided into 60 bins with @xmath48 and 2000 protons are ejected in each bin initially regardless of uhecr injection spectrum .",
    "the propagation of protons is calculated taking the energy - loss processes and pion production into account , and then the resultant spectra of uhe protons and neutrinos at the earth are recorded for each initial energy bin .",
    "the calculation of propagation stops when the energies of propagating protons reach @xmath49ev .",
    "neutrinos are assumed to lose their energies only due to the adiabatic energy loss .",
    "then , the resultant spectra sum up over all initial energy bins weighted by a given injection spectrum to obtain the spectra of uhe protons and cosmogenic neutrinos from a source . finally , the total spectra of protons and cosmogenic neutrinos are calculated by integrating their spectra from a source over all sources taking uhecr source - evolution models into account . the injection spectra and uhecr source - evolution models adopted in this study are explained in section [ method_integration ] .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos are produced by the decay of charged pions generated by photopion production of propagating protons with cosmic background photons .",
    "a charged pion decays into a muon and muon neutrino , @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "the muon decays into an electron and neutrinos , @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "there are many reaction modes for pions in photopion production , since protons with sufficient energies could produce more than one pions .",
    "the geant4 , which is used to calculate the total cross section , can also calculate exclusive cross section of each reaction mode , but it has some problems in parametrization .",
    "therefore , we combine the experimental data of exclusive cross sections similarly to ref.@xcite . in addition , it takes a large cpu time to fully simulate photopion production one by one .",
    "hence , we shall take a simpler treatment to calculate neutrino generation , as explained below .",
    "we consider @xmath54 as single pion production processes , and @xmath55 as double pion production processes .",
    "we adopt experimental results of the cross sections of these reactions below @xmath56 like refs .",
    "these cross sections are not confirmed well by experiments at @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we simply extrapolate the cross sections from @xmath58 gev@xmath59 to higher energy .",
    "then , we regard the total cross section minus the contributions of single and double pion production as the cross section of triple pion production , which generates @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the above treatment is sufficient unless multi - pion production processes are significant .",
    "once we judge that a propagating proton raises photopion production in calculation , the counterpart photon energy @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are determined by a method used in ref.@xcite .",
    "next , it is determined which reaction is realized based on the probabilities proportional to the cross section of each reaction mode at @xmath25 .",
    "the total energy of the produced pions is given by @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath63 is the energy of the pion for single pion production . for double or triple pion production , we assume the total energy , @xmath63 , to be divided equally into all pions . generated charged pions decay into muons and muon neutrinos .",
    "the energies of the products are calculated using the two body decay algorithm .",
    "the energies of the products of muon decay are calculated using the three body decay algorithm .",
    "the pions and muons decay immediately .",
    "neutrinos are also produced by the beta decay of neutrons , @xmath64 , which result from charged pion production .",
    "these neutrinos can contribute to the observed neutrino flux if the mean free path of the beta decay , @xmath65 , is shorter than that of photopion production of a neutron which is assumed to be equal to that of a proton . at @xmath31 , for example , the mean free path of the photopion production is comparable with that of beta decay of a neutron with @xmath66ev . hence , the neutron beta decay is also an important process for neutrino productions .",
    "this process generates only anti - electron neutrinos .",
    "the energies of the products are calculated using the three body decay algorithm .",
    "the total flux of cosmogenic neutrinos is calculated by integrating a neutrino flux from a source over all sources .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the number density and luminosity density of uhecr sources strongly affects on the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos . in this study , we consider four source - evolution models in which sources are uniformly distributed with cosmological evolution up to @xmath29 .",
    "the first is a uniform distribution without cosmological source - evolution ( unf ) .",
    "the second is a model following the luminosity density evolution of quasars ( qso ) , which is parametrized by ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath67 the third follows a star formation rate ( sfr ) deduced from the reconstruction of a ir / uv background flux used in this study , @xmath68 the fourth , the last model is motivated by an assumption that the observed uhecrs come from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "although the redshift distribution of grbs is still controversial and it is different between pre - swift and swift bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , one plausible rate history is that the grb rate is more enhanced at higher redshifts due to metalicity effect @xcite .",
    "it infers that the progenitors of grbs would favor metal - poor stars , and host galaxies of grbs would tend to have low metalicities @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall adopt such an evolution model , and refer this grb rate model as a `` grb - metalicity anti - correlation '' model . more specifically",
    ", we shall assume a following rate history , @xmath69 , which is used in ref.@xcite based on the calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "we use this parametrization in our fourth source - evolution model ( sfr+grbmac below ) . as for the star formation rate , @xmath70 in the third model",
    "is adopted .",
    "our results do not depend on the local grb rate which is somewhat uncertain so far , because we use the observed uhecr flux for the normalization of the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos .",
    "however , note that the lower local rate requires higher baryon loading per grb if uhecrs come from grbs .    as for the proton injection spectra at all sources , we assume a simple power - law spectrum , @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are a spectral index , the maximum acceleration energy of protons and the minimum energy of protons at sources respectively . these are treated as free parameters .",
    "if uhecr sources have a spectral index steeper than 2 , the total injection energy from a source could exceed the energy budget of possible candidates of uhecr sources .",
    "thus , @xmath74 is required as a cutoff . for conserving energetics , a broken power - law spectrum , for example",
    ", @xmath75 at lower energy than an energy @xmath76 , which is a break energy of the spectral index as parameter , was proposed @xcite .",
    "@xmath74 in this study should be interpreted as a minimum energy if uhecr injection spectrum can be expressed by a single spectral index .",
    "taking these source - evolution models into account , the total neutrino flux from all sources is calculated as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the source - evolution factor and the number of cosmogenic neutrinos with energy @xmath80 at the earth produced by protons with energy @xmath81 injected from a source at redshift @xmath30 per time at @xmath31 .",
    "the normalization factor of the neutrino flux and the value of @xmath72 are determined by fitting the observed uhecr spectra .",
    "in this section , the results of our calculations of the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos are described .",
    "first of all , we compare our calculated spectrum to a spectrum estimated by ref .",

    "in addition , our spectrum is divided into two spectra : the contributions of the cmb photons ( _ red dashed line _ ) and the others ( _ red dot - dashed line _ ) .",
    "differences between the two calculations are the treatment of photopion production and ir / uv background models .",
    "photopion production is treated by a simplified method explained in section [ method ] in this study , while fully simulated by using an event generator sophia @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite . for ir / uv background photons ,",
    "we adopt a model constructed by ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite used another model by ref .",
    "the other parameters are the same ones for comparison : @xmath84ev , @xmath85ev , the proton injection spectrum of @xmath86 , and a strong source evolution model defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "these fluxes are normalized by the same method as in ref.@xcite .",
    "our calculation well agrees with the estimation of ref .",
    "@xcite , but the neutrino fluxes at @xmath82 ev and above @xmath87 ev are about a factor of 2 smaller than those by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the discrepancy of the flux at @xmath82 ev is explained by the difference of adopted ir / uv background models as follows . at @xmath31 ,",
    "the number density of photons in the background model of ref.@xcite is about twice as small as that of ref.@xcite at @xmath88 ev . since photopion production dominantly occurs through the delta resonance , @xmath89 , the energy of protons which dominantly interact with photons of 0.2 ev is @xmath90 ev and the energy of produced neutrinos is @xmath82 ev . the mean free path of these protons for photopion production is @xmath91 mpc at @xmath31 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mfp ] ) , and therefore the universe is transparent against these protons .",
    "thus , the number of interactions is proportional to the photon number density , and then the ir / uv background radiation model by ref.@xcite leads to the neutrino flux twice as large as that in the background model used in this study at @xmath82 ev .",
    "note that these neutrinos are not generated at high - redshift universe because the energy - loss length of bethe - heitler pair - creation is much shorter than the interaction length of photopion production ( see fig.[fig : mfp ] ) .",
    "hence , a discussion above at @xmath31 is sufficient .",
    "the shape of the spectrum of cosmogenic neutrinos gives us useful information on ir background photons .",

    "finally , we revisit diffuse neutrino fluxes from agns and grbs and discuss the detectability of cosmogenic neutrinos . in fig.[fig : main ] , the diffuse neutrino flux from agns , maximally estimated in ref.@xcite , is shown .",

    "grbs are also possible candidates of the sources of uhe neutrinos . in principle",
    ", high - energy neutrinos from grbs can be distinguished from cosmogenic neutrinos since such neutrinos correlate with the prompt @xmath123-rays of grbs .",
