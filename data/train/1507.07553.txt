    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) host multiple stellar populations of widely ( sometime wildly ) different chemical composition and slightly different ages , as shown since longtime by spectroscopy and more recently by photometric studies ( see the review by gratton , carretta , bragaglia 2012 for a summary of observations , references and topics on gcs ) .",
    "the first evidence from abundance analyses in the last two decades of the past century revealed clear c - n , na - o anticorrelations , as well as the first correlations between na and al abundances in a few gcs , reviewed by e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "very different abundances of these light elements in coeval stars at the same evolutionary stage in otherwise monometallic stellar aggregates did negate the very same definition of simple stellar population .",
    "however this concept was not abandoned until two milestones were reached .",
    "first , theory provided the understanding that the observed abundance patterns could be generated by the simultaneous action of the nana and mgal cycles in the same stratification where the on part of the cno cycle is operating in h - buning at high temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the first observation of the na - o and mg - al anticorrelations among unevolved gc stars @xcite unambigously demonstrated that the na , al - enhanced , o , mg - depleted composition must be inherited by the most massive stars of a ( several ) previous stellar generation(s ) .",
    "since then , the ( anti)correlations among proton - capture elements have been understood to represent the true dna of gcs .",
    "these relations distinguish cluster stars from the other _ phylum _ of pop.ii field stars where only the basic evolutionary effects - first dredge - up and a second mixing episode after the red giant branch ( rgb ) bump in the luminosity function - on the lightest c and n elements are observed @xcite .",
    "the best studied chemical signature is the na - o anticorrelation , discovered by the lick - texas group ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so widespread that can be considered as the fingerprint of a _ bona fide _ globular cluster @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of this important tracer shows that almost all gcs are composed of multiple populations .",
    "the more recent photometric approach to multiple populations in gcs exploits the presence in the filter passbands of absorption features of proton - capture elements . in most cases only the lightest elements c ,",
    "n are involved , with impact on those blue / near - uv filters including nh , cn , and ch features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "using pseudo - color indexes , where stars of different generations are more or less separated owing the different chemical composition , it is at present routinely possible to uncover broad or split photometric sequences in most gcs .",
    "the recent addition of the f275w passband of the wfc3 camera @xcite , which samples an oh molecular band , is useful to connect these photometric sequences with heavier proton - capture elements like o ( and na , through the nena and on cycles ) .",
    "although no photometric filter seems to be presently able to detect differences in the heaviest elements involved in proton - capture reactions ( mg , al , si ) , space based uv photometry confirms that most gcs are formed by multiple populations .    however , some gcs are more multiple than others .",
    "the most recent case is ngc  2808 where @xcite separated five distinct populations using a combination of f275w , f336w , and f438w filters from @xmath4 .",
    "ngc  2808 is a pivotal object to investigate in detail the complex scenario of the origin of multiple populations in gcs , exploiting the wealth of photometric and spectroscopic data gathered for this cluster .",
    "apart from @xmath5 cen and m  54 , whose metallicity spread tells a tale of a different origin ( probably in / as a core of a former dwarf nucleated galaxy ) , ngc  2808 is the fifth more massive object in the catalogue by @xcite of galactic gcs ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the present day total mass is found to be the driving parameter in establishing the extent of chemical differences among multiple populations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cluster mass is one of the more relevant factors ( together with the metallicity ) in determining whether proton - capture reactions are able to proceed to temperatures so high to significantly affect the primordial level of heavier elements like mg , from type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "three distinct main sequences ( ms ) were known since long time to exist in this gc @xcite , one of the best examples of the impact on the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of helium , the main outcome of the h - burning at high temperature .",
    "the distribution of stars along its horizontal branch ( hb ) is multimodal @xcite and reach quite hot effective temperature , again a good signature of enhanced he abundance in a fraction of stars .",
    "our group is actively working since many years on the chemical composition of stars in ngc  2808 , gathering an unprecedented wealth of data .",
    "the first evidence of multiple populations in this cluster came from the analysis of na abundances in 81 giants from moderately high resolution flames spectra @xcite .",
    "the spread in [ na / fe ] [ x]= log(x)@xmath7 log(x)@xmath8 for any abundance quantity x , and log @xmath9(x ) = log ( n@xmath10/n@xmath11 ) + 12.0 for absolute number density abundances . ] was found to span a range of about 1 dex similar to what found in other gcs by the lick - texas group .",
    "soon after , @xcite confirmed the multiple populations in ngc  2808 by finding an extended na - o anticorrelation on the rgb from high resolution uves spectra of 20 stars , with [ o / fe ] ratios as low as -1 dex .",
    "this is not surprising , since there is a tight correlation between the extent of the na - o anticorrelation and the maximum temperature along the hb @xcite , both features driven again by the same factor , he .",
    "ngc  2808 was one of the gcs used by @xcite to define the interquartile range of the [ o / na ] ratio , iqr[o / na ] , as an efficient way to quantify the extension of the na - o anticorrelation and the relevance at large of changes in chemical composition due to the process of formation of a gc and its multiple population . abundance analysis of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analysis of giraffe spectra for 120 giants in ngc  2808 @xcite started our flames survey devoted to study the link between na - o anticorrelation and hb in about 25 gcs @xcite .",
    "however , being the first target considered in the survey , ngc  2808 was analysed with slightly different procedures from those used for the other gcs , in particular the scale of effective temperatures , efficiently tuned for all other gcs to minimize the impact of uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters on star - to - star errors in abundances .",
    "this unconsistency calls for a re - analysis of all the available material to derive the chemical composition of stars in ngc  2808 in homogeneous way with respect to the other gcs in the survey .",
    "first results of this re - analysis concerning the al abundances ( only available for 31 rgb stars with uves spectra ) were already presented in @xcite along with mg abundances .",
    "the stars were found clustered into three discrete groups with different chemical composition along the mg - al anticorrelation .",
    "the fractions of stars in the three components were found in excellent agreement with the number ratios computed by @xcite on the three mss .    in the present paper",
    "we provide the full derivation of the atmospheric parameters for all stars with available spectra from previous analyses . for 31 giants with uves datat we derived abundances of fe , o , na , si , ca , ti , sc , cr , mn , ni .",
    "homogeneous abundances of fe , o , na are derived again for the 123 giants with giraffe spectra and new abundances of mg , si , ca , ti , sc , cr , and ni were obtained for the first time for this large set of stars .",
    "homogeneous abundance ratios in our total sample extend the analysis of discrete components along the rgb of ngc  2808 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the analysis method and the derivation of the atmospheric parameters with associated errors , the results for abundances , the na - o and na - mg anticorrelations are presented in  3 , whereas the chemical tagging of multiple populations in ngc  2808 is discussed in  4 .",
    "finally , in  5 we summarise our findings .",
    "the observational material of the present re - analysis consists in uves spectra for 31 red giants and giraffe spectra for 123 giants , all acquired with the flames instrument @xcite at the eso vlt - ut2 telescope .",
    "we used proprietary uves data ( eso programme 072.d-0507 ) for 12 stars analysed in @xcite and uves spectra from the flames science verification for 19 stars whose analysis was done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these spectra have a resolution of r@xmath12 and a spectral range between 4800 and 6800   , with a small gap at about 5900   .",
    "coordinates and magnitudes for all 31 stars of the uves sample can be found in @xcite .    the giraffe spectra were taken with the high resolution grating and two setups , hr11 ( @xmath13 , wavelength range 5597 - 5840   ) and hr13 ( @xmath14 , wavelength range 6120 - 6405   ) . in this giraffe sample ,",
    "32 stars were observed with hr11 only , 28 with hr13 only and 63 have observations with both setups . coordinates and magnitudes for these giants",
    "are in @xcite .",
    "details of the observations and data reduction are reported in the original papers .",
    "fourteen out of 154 rgb stars were observed with both uves and giraffe , hence our final sample consists of 140 individual stars , all members of the rgb of ngc  2808 ( see the original papers by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spanning the magnitude range @xmath15 . in fig .",
    "[ f : cmd2808 ] the location of these rgb stars on the @xmath16 cmd from @xcite is shown . only one star is fainter than the rgb - bump level @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the optical photometry was integrated with @xmath18 band magnitudes from the point source catalogue of 2mass @xcite to derive atmospheric parameters as described in the next section .",
    "all the abundances derived in the present re - analysis rest on equivalent widths ( @xmath19s ) measured with the procedure described in @xcite and using the latest version of the package rosa @xcite .",
    "a first difference with the original analysis in @xcite is that this time the @xmath19s measured on the giraffe spectra were corrected to the system defined by @xmath19s from the higher resolution uves spectra .",
    "we used a linear regression between the two sets of measurements derived using 478 lines in common for the 14 stars observed with both instruments .",
    "the corrected @xmath19s from giraffe are plotted as a function of the uves @xmath19s in fig  [ f : ewcorr ] .",
    "the second step concerns the effective temperature ( t@xmath20 ) scale . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the giants of our sample were analysed using t@xmath20 values derived from @xmath21 colours and the calibration by @xcite .",
    "the new approach followed for the other 23 gcs and adopted here also for ngc  2808 is to use the above temperatures as first pass values : the final values adopted for all our target stars were obtained using an average relation between t@xmath22 and the @xmath18 apparent magnitudes of the rgb stars .",
    "this adopted procedure has three advantages : it decreases the star - to - star scatter in abundances due to uncertainties in temperatures ( magnitudes are more precise than colours ) , it minimises the impact of the differential reddening in ngc  2808 on derived t@xmath20 , and finally it is fully consistent with the procedure adopted for all the other gcs .",
    "surface gravities @xmath23 were obtained from bolometric corrections ( from alonso et al . ) , the newly derived effective temperatures , reddening and distance modulus from @xcite , and assuming masses of 0.85 m@xmath8 and @xmath24 as bolometric magnitude for the sun .",
    "finally , values of the microturbulent velocity @xmath25 were obtained by eliminating in each star trends of the abundances from fe  i lines with the expected line strength ( see magain 1984 ) .",
    "final abundances were derived from @xmath19 analysis , by choosing the model in the @xcite grid of solar - scaled lte model atmospheres with the overshooting option switched on , with the proper atmospheric parameters , whose abundance matched the one derived from fe  i lines . adopted line list , atomic parameters and solar reference abundances",
    "are described in @xcite .",
    "ngc  2808 is confirmed to be monometallic , as far the content of iron is concerned .",
    "on the homogeneous metallicity scale based on high resolution uves spectra @xcite the metal abundance in ngc  2808 is on average [ fe / h ]  i@xmath1 dex ( @xmath26 from the 31 stars observed with uves ( where the first and second error bars refer to the statistical and systematic errors , respectively , see next section ) . from the reanalysis of the 123 stars with giraffe spectra we derive on average [ fe / h ]  i@xmath27 dex ( @xmath28 .",
    "we then are entitled to merge the two subsample , adopting the values from uves for all abundances in the 14 stars observed with both instruments .",
    "the improvement due to the new homogeneous procedure is immediately evident in the decrease of the @xmath29 scatters associated to the mean fe values , the previous values being @xmath30 and @xmath31 for uves and giraffe , respectively .",
    "abundances of iron derived from singly ionized transitions are in very good agreement with the above values .",
    "we derived [ fe / h ]  ii@xmath32 dex @xmath33 dex , 31 stars ) and [ fe / h ]  ii@xmath34 dex @xmath35 dex , 91 stars ) from the uves and giraffe samples , respectively .",
    "derived abundances of [ fe / h ]  i and [ fe / h ]  ii are plotted as a function of the effective temperatures in fig .",
    "[ f : feteff28 ] , together with internal , star - to - star error bars as estimated in the next subsection .",

    "error bars on the right and on the left side are star - to - star errors for targets observed with uves and giraffe , respectively . ]",
    "abundances of fe , o , na , mg , al , si , ca , ti , cr , mn , and ni for 19 giants with uves spectra from the flames science verification were originally presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "o , na , mg , al , and si for the 12 rgb stars observed with uves in our flames survey were analysed originally with other 202 stars in 17 gcs in @xcite . these abundances are derived again using the new scale of atmospheric parameters discussed above for all 31 stars of the uves sample and are presented here for the first time , except for abundances of al and mg @xcite . for these stars , abundances of ti and cr were obtained using both neutral and singly ionized species , with results in excellent agreement .",
    "for the 123 stars in the giraffe sample , fe , o , na were revisited with respect to the values in @xcite obtained with the previous temperature scale and without correcting the @xmath19s to the uves system .",
    "abundances of mg , si , ca , ti , cr , ni are obtained for the first time in the present analysis . due to the limited spectral range of giraffe spectra , only transitions of neutral ti and cr",
    "were available for this set of giants .",
    "abundances of na were corrected for effects of departures from the lte assumption using prescriptions by @xcite , whereas abundance corrections for sc and mn as in @xcite were adopted to account for the hyperfine structure .    in summary",
    ", we obtained homogeneous abundances of the elements o , na , mg , si involved in proton - capture reactions .",
    "moreover , we derived abundances of elements representative of the @xmath0capture process ( ca , ti ) and of the fe - group ( sc , cr , mn , ni ) .",
