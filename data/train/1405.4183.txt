    "besides the hopping of electrons in the same orbital , we consider hybridization between different orbitals in neighboring sites .",

    "the interest in these chains goes back to schokley s work on surface states  @xcite .",
    "these states were investigated in detail  @xcite , but until recently it lacked the theoretical tools for their understanding , specially of the zero energy surface states  @xcite .    a cold atom version of the @xmath0-chain , the @xmath0-ladder , has recently been investigated in light of the new concepts of topological insulators  @xcite .",

    "is studied using a scattering approach that considers the end of the chain as a defect in a perfect crystal  @xcite .",
    "the scattering problem due to the defect has an associated @xmath3-matrix whose poles give the energies of the end states .    in spite of the different symmetries of the @xmath0 and @xmath1-wave chains",

    "this mapping is purely formal as the two systems have different symmetries and physical properties .",
    "the former is a non - interacting band insulator and the latter a @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "this mapping in the case of semi infinite chains leads to interesting results regarding the nature of the end states .",
    "we show that both the semi - infinite @xmath1-wave and @xmath0-chains have zero energy end modes when these systems are in non - trivial topological phases . for the @xmath1-wave chain , this zero energy mode",
    "is immediately recognized as a majorana fermion . for the @xmath0-chain , the zero energy state share many properties with those of a majorana mode .",
    "for example , the penetration length of the zero energy end modes of both models diverge at the topological transition separating the trivial from the non - trivial topological phases .",
    "exact diagonalization results confirm the correlation length exponent obtained analytically and are able to extend the results to parameter values away from the specific symmetric point and also include the effects of disorder .",

    "iii , using a @xmath3-matrix scattering approach we calculate the decay length of the end mode and compare with exact diagonalization results .",
    "while the analytical method is limited to a very specific choice of the parameters , the numerical method can also be extended to arbitrary values of these parameters and gives some insights on the nature of the end states in the topological phase . in sec .",
    "iv , we study robustness of the end states against disorder using exact diagonalization approach .",
    "we find that the end states survive for any values of the strength of the symmetric disorder . in sec .",

    "let us consider a one dimensional atomic system with two orbitals per site of angular momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "due to their different parities the hybridization between these orbitals in neighboring sites is antisymmetric .",

    "[ sp ] and  [ kita ] , respectively .",

    "<S> we study a two - band model of fermions in a 1d chain with an antisymmetric hybridization that breaks inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for certain values of its parameters , the @xmath0-chain maps formally into a @xmath1-wave superconducting chain , the archetypical 1d system exhibiting majorana fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenspectra , including the existence of zero energy modes in the topological phase , agree for both models . </S>",
    "<S> the end states too share several similarities in both models , such as the behavior of the localization length , the non - trivial topological index and robustness to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show by mapping the @xmath2- and @xmath1- fermions to two copies of majoranas , that the excitations in the ends of a finite @xmath0 chain are indeed conventional fermions though endowed with protected topological properties . </S>",
    "<S> our results are obtained by a scattering approach in a semi - infinite chain with an edge defect treated within the @xmath3-matrix approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we augment the analytical results with exact numerical diagonalization that allow us to extend our results to arbitrary parameters and also to disordered systems . </S>"
