    "the magnetic monopoles that arise in spontaneously broken gauge theories can easily be generalized to dyons that have a u(1 ) electric charge in addition to their magnetic charge .",
    "it then is natural to ask whether , in cases where the unbroken symmetry is non - abelian , it is possible to have monopoles carrying non - abelian electric charge .",
    "such objects , referred to as chromodyons , were first considered in the context of an su(5 ) grand unified theory . after attempts to construct such chromodyons failed  @xcite , it was shown that the non - abelian magnetic charge of the su(5 ) monopole creates a topological obstruction to the existence of non - abelian `` color '' electric charge  @xcite , and the issue",
    "was abandoned for a number of years . since then , however , it has been realized that , with other choices of gauge group , there can be monopoles with purely abelian magnetic charge , even though the unbroken gauge group is non - abelian  @xcite . because there is then no topological barrier to a color electric charge , it is natural to revisit the subject and consider whether chromodyons can exist .",
    "let us first recall how ordinary u(1 ) dyons arise .",
    "when there is an unbroken u(1 ) symmetry , any soliton with a nonvanishing charged field has a zero mode corresponding to a shift in the phases of the complex charged fields .",
    "exciting this mode in a time - dependent fashion produces a u(1 ) charge .",
    "if the u(1 ) symmetry is gauged , it may be possible to gauge transform away the time - dependence of the phase , but the gauge - invariant electric charge remains .",
    "the simplest example of this occurs with su(2 ) broken to u(1 ) , where the julia - zee dyon  @xcite arises from rotation of the phase of the massive vector boson fields in the core of the t  hooft - polyakov monopole  @xcite .",
    "similarly , if there is an unbroken non - abelian symmetry , excitation of the gauge orientation zero modes of a soliton gives rise to a non - abelian electric charge .",
    "in the theory with su(5 ) broken to @xmath1 , the unit monopoles have nontrivial fields that are not invariant under the unbroken su(3 ) .",
    "hence , one would expect to be able to generate dyons that were charged under the color su(3 ) ( hence the term `` chromodyon '' ) by exciting the resulting global gauge zero modes . however , abouelsaood  @xcite found that , because the gauge potential has a @xmath2 tail in the unbroken subgroup , some of the expected zero modes are non - normalizable , and the proposed construction does not go through .",
    "a deeper explanation for this was given by nelson and manohar  @xcite , and by balachandran et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that the non - abelian coulomb magnetic field creates a topological obstruction that prevents one from globally defining a basis for the unbroken color subgroup . this inability to define `` global color '' is the fundamental reason for the nonexistence of the su(5 ) chromodyons .",
    "these barriers to the existence of a chromodyon would both be absent if the total magnetic charge were purely abelian .",
    "this can certainly be achieved by assembling a collection of magnetic monopoles such that the non - abelian components of their charges sum to zero ; a two - monopole example of this was studied by coleman and nelson  @xcite .",
    "however , what we need to produce a chromodyon is a single monopole with purely abelian magnetic charge .",
    "while there are no such monopoles in the su(5 ) theory , they do exist in a theory with so(5 ) broken to u(1)@xmath3su(2 ) .",
    "these were first discovered  @xcite in the bps limit , where they appear as spherically symmetric classical solutions that are characterized by a `` cloud size '' @xmath4 that can take on any positive value .",
    "these can be interpreted as being composed of a massive monopole , carrying both abelian and non - abelian magnetic charge , and a massless monopole , with only non - abelian magnetic charge . at the semiclassical level ,",
    "the latter is manifested as a cloud of non - abelian field , of radius @xmath4 , that surrounds the core of the massive monopole and completely shields the non - abelian part of its magnetic charge . in the bps limit the energy is independent of @xmath4 . however ,",
    "if the lagrangian includes a nonvanishing potential , the cloud size is no longer arbitrary , but rather is fixed .",
    "this then gives a magnetic monopole whose long - range field lies only in the u(1 ) sector , but whose core transforms under the unbroken su(2 ) and thus gives rise to the gauge zero modes from which we might hope to construct a chromodyon .",
    "it is this system that we will study .",
    "we start , in sec .",
    "[ so5section ] , by constructing the static so(5 ) monopole .",
    "an analytic solution exists for the bps case .",
    "however , as we explain later on , the possibility of varying the cloud size makes these unsuitable for our purposes .",
    "instead , we must take for our starting point a non - bps monopole , for which the field equations must be solved numerically . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : siminitialdata ] , we construct a chromodyonic configuration from this monopole by applying an su(2 ) gauge rotation and solving for the @xmath5 field that is required by gauss s law .",
    "although this is not an exact static solution of the field equations , one might expect it to be close to the desired chromodyon .",
    "we test this by numerically simulating the time evolution with this as the initial configuration .",
    "we describe the details of this simulation in sec .",

    "the results are described in sec .",
    "[ slowdownsection ] .",
    "we find that , rather than evolving toward a stable chromodyon , the chromodyonic configuration continually radiates non - abelian charge .",
    "although we are not able to continue the simulation long enough to verify that this charge is completely radiated away , every evidence indicates that this will be the case .",

    "there are two appendices containing some technical details .",
    "we are interested in theories with lagrangian densities of the form @xmath6 here the gauge field @xmath7 and the adjoint representation higgs field @xmath8 are both written as imaginary antisymmetric @xmath9 matrices .    to describe the components of these and other adjoint representation fields , we will adopt the following conventions . in the defining representation ,",
    "the generators of so(5 ) are the ten 5@xmath35 matrices @xmath10 from these we can define six matrices @xmath11 that generate so(4)=su(2)@xmath3su(2 ) .",

    "so(5 ) can be broken to su(2)@xmath3u(1 ) in two inequivalent ways . in the first ,",
    "corresponding to the decomposition @xmath21 , the su(2 ) is the subgroup , with the generators @xmath22 , that rotates the first three components of a five - vector among themselves .",

    "we will henceforth assume that this has been done , so that @xmath29 vanishes identically .",
    "requiring that the fields be nonsingular at the origin gives the boundary conditions @xmath31 the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be nonzero at the origin .",
    "however , examination of the field equations , which we will display below , shows that nonsingular solutions must have @xmath34 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath35 .    to obtain the symmetry breaking that we want , the asymptotic value of the higgs field must lie in the subgroup generated by the @xmath36 , giving the boundary conditions @xmath37 with this choice ,",
    "the third - sector gauge fields are massive , so @xmath38 falls exponentially fast at large distance .",
    "the behavior of the other , massless , gauge fields depends on the magnetic charge . if the latter is a purely abelian unit charge , then at large distance @xmath39    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the bps limit of vanishing scalar potential there is a solution given by @xmath40 where @xmath4 is any positive real number and @xmath41    this solution can be interpreted as being composed of two distinct fundamental monopoles .",
    "one is a massive monopole , with core radius @xmath42 , whose magnetic charge has both non - abelian and abelian components .",
    "the other is a massless monopole that is manifested at the semiclassical level as a cloud of radius @xmath4 whose magnetic charge cancels the non - abelian part of the massive monopole s charge .",

    "hence , the long - range magnetic field , and thus the total magnetic charge , have only first - sector components and are purely abelian .",
    "one might think that the knowledge of the explicit analytic form of this monopole solution would make it an ideal case for constructing chromodyons .",
    "as we will see in the next section , this turns out not to be so .",
    "the difficulty arises from the fact that the energy of the bps monopole is independent of the cloud size @xmath4 , so that a small perturbation can cause the cloud to expand without bound . to avoid this problem",

    "it is easy to see what will happen if the initial configuration of eqs .  ( [ jzah ] ) and ( [ jza0 ] ) is allowed to evolve .",

    "it will shed energy by radiating massless photons , but the amount of this energy loss is constrained by the fact that exact dyon mass places a lower bound on the energy . as the dyon radiates its phase rotation will slow down and its core will expand . for small electric charge ( i.e. , @xmath240 ) , this slowing and expansion will both be small , and the system will quickly approach its final state . in particular , the slowing of the phase rotation will be far less than that which we found in our non - abelian simulation .",
