    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) structures of a protein are residue - wise quantities or symbols onto which some features of the native three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure are projected .",
    "1d structures are of interest for several reasons . for example , predicted secondary structures , a kind of 1d structures , are often used to limit the conformational space to be searched in 3d structure prediction . furthermore , it has recently been shown that certain sets of the native ( as opposed to predicted ) 1d structures of a protein contain sufficient information to recover the native 3d structure  @xcite .",
    "these 1d structures are either the principal eigenvector of the contact map  @xcite or a set of secondary structures ( ss ) , contact numbers ( cn ) and residue - wise contact orders ( rwco )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible , at least in principle , to predict the native 3d structure by first predicting the 1d structures , and then by constructing the 3d structure from these 1d structures .",
    "1d structures are not only useful for 3d structure predictions , but also helpful for intuitive understanding of the correspondence between the protein structure and its amino acid sequence due to the residue - wise characteristics of 1d structures . therefore , accurate prediction of 1d protein structures is of fundamental biological interest .",
    "secondary structure prediction has a long history @xcite .",
    "almost all the modern predictors are based on position - specific scoring matrices ( pssm ) and some kind of machine learning techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines .",
    "currently the best predictors achieve @xmath0 of 7779% @xcite .",
    "the study of contact number prediction also started long time ago @xcite , but further improvements were made only recently @xcite .",
    "these recent methods are based on the ideas developed in ss predictions ( i.e. , pssm and machine learning ) , and achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.680.73 .",
    "recently , we have developed a new method for accurately predicting ss , cn , and rwco based on a novel machine learning scheme , critical random networks ( crn )  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we briefly describe the formulation of the method , and recent improvements leading to even better predictions . the computer program for ss , cn , and rwco prediction named crnpred has been developed for the convenience of the general user , and a web interface and source code",
    "are made available online .",
    "_ secondary structures ( ss ) : _ secondary structures were defined by the dssp program @xcite . for three - state ss prediction , the simple encoding scheme ( the so - called ck mapping )",
    "was employed @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath1 helices ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 strands ( @xmath4 ) , and other structures ( `` coils '' ) defined by dssp were encoded as @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "note that we do not use the casp - style conversion scheme ( the so - called ehl mapping ) in which dssp s @xmath2 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 helix ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 helix ) are encoded as @xmath2 , and dssp s @xmath4 and @xmath10 ( @xmath3 bridge ) as @xmath4 .",
    "we believe the ck mapping is more natural and useful for 3d structure predictions ( e.g. , geometrical restraints should be different between an @xmath1 helix and a @xmath7 helix ) . for ss prediction",
    ", we introduce feature variables @xmath11 to represent each type of secondary structures at the @xmath12-th residue position , so that @xmath2 is represented as @xmath13 , @xmath4 as @xmath14 , and @xmath5 as @xmath15 .",
    "_ contact numbers ( cn ) : _ let @xmath16 represent the contact map of a protein .",
    "usually , the contact map is defined so that @xmath17 if the @xmath12-th and @xmath18-th residues are in contact by some definition , or @xmath19 , otherwise . as in our previous study ,",
    "we slightly modify the definition using a sigmoid function .",
    "that is , @xmath20\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the distance between @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for glycines ) atoms of the @xmath12-th and @xmath18-th residues , @xmath24 is a cutoff distance , and @xmath25 is a sharpness parameter of the sigmoid function which is set to 3 @xcite . the rather generous cutoff length of 12 was shown to optimize the prediction accuracy @xcite .",
    "the use of the sigmoid function enables us to use the contact numbers in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . using the above definition of the contact map , the contact number of the @xmath12-th residue of a protein is defined as @xmath26 the feature variable @xmath27 for cn",
    "is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the sequence length of a target protein .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath30 is introduced because we have observed that the contact number averaged over a protein chain is roughly proportional to @xmath30 , and thus division by this value removes the size - dependence of predicted contact numbers .    _",
    "residue - wise contact orders ( rwco ) : _ rwco was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "this quantity measures the extent to which a residue makes long - range contacts in a native protein structure . using the same notation as contact numbers ,",
    "the rwco of the @xmath12-th residue in a protein structure is defined by @xmath31 the feature variable @xmath27 for rwco is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath29 is the sequence length . due to the similar reason as cn , the normalization factor @xmath29 was introduced to remove the size - dependence of the predicted rwcos ( the rwco averaged over a protein chain is roughly proportional to the chain length ) .",
    "here we briefly describe the critical random network ( crn ) method introduced in @xcite which should be referred to for the details . unlike most conventional methods for 1d structure prediction [ except for",
    "some including the bidirectional recurrent neural networks @xcite ] , the crn method takes the whole amino acid sequence into account . in the crn method ,",
    "an @xmath33-dimensional state vector @xmath34 is assigned to the @xmath12-th residue of the target sequence ( we use @xmath35 throughout this paper ) .",
    "neighboring state vectors along the sequence are connected via a random @xmath36 orthogonal matrix @xmath37 .",
    "this matrix is also block - diagonal with the size of blocks ranging uniformly randomly between 2 and 50 .",
    "the input to the crn is the position - specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) , @xmath38 of the target sequence obtained by psi - blast  @xcite ( @xmath29 is the sequence length of the target protein ) .",
    "we impose that the state vectors satisfy the following equation of state : @xmath39\\ ] ] for @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an @xmath42 random matrix ( the 21st component of @xmath43 is always set to unity ) , and @xmath3 and @xmath1 are scalar parameters .",
    "the fixed boundary condition is imposed ( @xmath44 ) . by setting @xmath45 , the system of state vectors is made to be near a critical point in a certain sense , and thus the range of site - site correlation is expected to be long when @xmath1 is sufficiently small but finite  @xcite . in this way",
    ", each state vector implicitly incorporates long - range correlations .",
    "the 1d structure of the @xmath12-th residue is predicted as a linear projection of a local window of the pssm and the state vector obtained by solving eq .",
    "[ eq : eos ] : @xmath46 where @xmath27 is the predicted quantity , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the regression parameters . in the first summation ,",
    "each pssm column is extended to include the `` terminal '' residue . since eq .",
    "[ eq : pred ] is a simple linear equation once the equation of state ( eq . [ eq : eos ] ) has been solved , learning the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath49 reduces to an ordinary linear regression problem . for ss prediction ,",
    "the triple @xmath50 is calculated simultaneously , and the ss class is predicted as @xmath51 . for the cn and rwco prediction , real values are predicted ( 2-state prediction is also made for cn using the average cn for each residue type as the threshold for `` exposed '' or `` buried '' as in @xcite ) . the half window size @xmath52 is set to 9 for ss and cn predictions , and to 26 for rwco .",
    "since the crn - based prediction is parametrized by the random matrices @xmath37 and @xmath41 , slightly different predictions are obtained for different pairs of @xmath37 and @xmath41 .",
    "we can improve the prediction by taking the average over an ensemble of such different predictions .",
    "20 crn - based predictors were constructed using 20 sets of different random matrices @xmath37 and @xmath41 .",
    "cn and rwco are predicted as uniform averages of these 20 predictions .    for ss prediction , we employ further training .",
    "let @xmath53 be the prediction results of the @xmath54-th predictor for 1d structure @xmath55 ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , cn , and rwco ) of the @xmath12-th residue .",
    "the second stage ss prediction is made by the following linear scheme : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the weight obtained from a training set .",
    "finally , the feature variable for each ss class of the @xmath12-th residue is obtained by @xmath59 .",
    "this last procedure was found particularly effective for improving the segment overlap ( sov ) measure .",
    "another improvement is the addition of the amino acid composition of the target sequence to the predictor @xcite : the term @xmath60 was added to eq .",
    "[ eq : pred ] where @xmath61 is a regression parameter , and @xmath62 is the fraction of the amino acid type @xmath63 .",
    "we carried out a 15-fold cross - validation test following exactly the same procedure and the same data set as the previous study @xcite . in the data set ,",
    "there are 680 protein domains , each of which represents a superfamily according to the scop database ( version 1.65 ) @xcite .",
    "this data set was randomly divided so that 630 domains were used for training and the remaining 50 domains for testing , and the random division was repeated 15 times .",
    "no pair of these domains belong to the same superfamily , and hence they are not expected to be homologous .",
    "thus , the present benchmark is a very stringent one .    for obtaining pssms by running psi - blast , we use the uniref100 ( version 6.8 ) amino acid sequence database @xcite containing some 3 million entries .",
    "also the number of iterations in psi - blast homology searches was reduced to 3 times from 10 used in the previous study .",
    "this especially increased the accuracy of ss predictions .",
    "these results are consistent with the study of @xcite .",
    "one drawback of the crn method is the computational time required for numerically solving the equation of state ( eq . [ eq : eos ] ) . for that purpose , instead of the gauss - seidel - like method",
    "previously used , we implemented a successive over - relaxation method which was found to be much more efficient .",
    "let @xmath64 denote the stage of iteration .",
    "we set the initial value of the state vectors ( with @xmath65 ) as @xmath66.\\label{eq : init_eos}\\ ] ] then , for @xmath40 ( in increasing order of @xmath12 ) , we update the state vectors by @xmath67 - \\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(2\\nu)}\\}. \\label{eq : feos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , we update them in the reverse order .",
    "that is , for @xmath68 ( in decreasing order of @xmath12 ) , @xmath69 - \\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(2\\nu+1)}\\}. \\label{eq : beos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then set @xmath70 , and iterate eqs .",
    "( [ eq : feos ] ) and ( [ eq : beos ] ) until @xmath71 converges .",
    "the acceleration parameter of @xmath72 was found effective .",
    "the convergence criterion is @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "this criterion is much less stringent than previous study ( @xmath75 ) , but this does not affect the prediction accuracy significantly .",
    "convergence is typically achieved within 10 to 12 iterations for one protein .",
    "there are two main ingredients for the improved one - dimensional protein structure prediction in the present study .",
    "first is the use of large - scale critical random networks of 5000 dimension and 20 ensemble predictors .",
    "second is the use of a large sequence database ( uniref100 ) for psi - blast searches .",
    "as demonstrated in table  1 , the crn method achieves remarkably accurate predictions . in comparison with the previous study @xcite based on 2000-dimensional crns ( 10 ensemble predictors ) , the @xmath0 and @xmath76 measures in ss predictions",
    "improved from 77.8% and 77.3% to 80.5% and 80.0% , respectively .",
    "similarly , the average correlation coefficient improved from 0.726 to 0.746 for cn predictions , and from 0.601 to 0.613 for rwco predictions .",
    "the 2-state predictions for cn yields , on average , @xmath77 = 76.8% per chain and 76.7% per residue , and matthews correlation coefficient of 0.533 .",
    "a closer examination of the ss prediction results ( table 2 ) reveals the drastic improvement of @xmath3 strand prediction from @xmath78 = 61.9% to 69.3% ( per residue ) .",
    "although the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are slightly lower than in the previous study by 0.61.0% , the accuracies of other classes have improved by 2.54% .",
    "crnpred compares favorably with other secondary structure prediction methods .",
    "the widely used psipred program @xcite which is based on conventional feed - forward neural networks achieves @xmath0 of 78% . a more recently developed method , porter , @xcite which is based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks achieves @xmath0 of 79% .",
    "an even more intricate method based on bidirectional segmented - memory recurrent neural networks @xcite shows an accuracy of @xmath0 = 73% ( this rather low accuracy may be attributed to the small size of training set used ) .",
    "however , it should be reminded that these studies are based on different data sets for both training and testing as well as the definition of secondary structural categories .",
    "therefore , these comparisons may not be very informative , but only give a rough estimation of relative performance .",
    "regarding the contact number prediction , crnpred , achieving @xmath81 = 0.75 , is the most accurate method available today .",
    "the simple linear method @xcite with multiple sequence alignment derived from the hssp database @xcite showed a correlation coefficient of 0.63 . a more advanced method based on support vector machines ( local window - based ) achieves a correlation of 0.68 per chain@xcite .",
    "it is known that the number of homologs found by the psi - blast searches significantly affects the prediction accuracies @xcite .",
    "we have examined this effect by plotting the accuracy measures for a given minimum number of homologs found by psi - blast ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for example",
    ", we see in fig . 1 that , for those proteins with more than 100 homologs , the average @xmath0 for ss predictions is 82.2% .",
    "the effect of the number of homologs significantly depends on the type of 1d structure . for ss prediction",
    ", @xmath0 steadily increases as the number of homologs increases up to 100 , but it stays in the range between 82.0 and 82.4 until the minimum number of homologs reaches around 400 , and then it starts to decrease . for cn prediction , @xmath81 also increases steadily but more slowly , and it does not degrade when the minimum number of homologs reaches 500 .",
    "this tendency implies that cn is more conservative than ss during protein evolution , which is consistent with previous observations @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", rwco exhibits a peculiar behavior .",
    "the value of @xmath81 reaches its peak at the minimum number of homologs of 80 beyond which the value rapidly decreases .",
    "this indicates that rwco is not evolutionarily well conserved .",
    "it was observed that the accuracies of ss and cn predictions constantly increased when the dimension of crns was increased from 2000 to 5000 , but such was not the case for rwco ( data not shown ) .",
    "rwco seems to be such delicate a quantity that it is very difficult to extract relevant information from the amino acid sequence .",
    "finally , we note on practical applicability of predicted 1d structures .",
    "we do not believe , at present , that the construction of a 3d structure purely from the predicted 1d structures is practical , if possible at all , because of the limited accuracy of the rwco prediction .",
    "however , ss and cn predictions are very accurate for many proteins so that they may already serve as valuable restraints for 3d structure predictions . also , ss and cn predictions may be applied to domain identification often necessary for experimental determination of protein structures .",
    "crnpred has been proved useful for such a purpose @xcite .",
    "although of the limited accuracy , predicted rwcos still exhibit significant correlations with the correct values . since rwcos reflect the extent to which a residue is involved in long - range contacts , predicted rwcos may be useful for enumerating potentially structurally important residues .",
    "an interesting alternative application of the crn framework is to regard the solution of the equation of state ( eq . [ eq : eos ] ) as an extended sequence profile . by so doing , it is straightforward to apply the solution to the profile - profile comparison for fold recognition @xcite .",
    "such an application may be also pursued in the future .",
