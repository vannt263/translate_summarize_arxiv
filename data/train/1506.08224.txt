    "classical laws of transport on electrical networks have been established by gustav kirchhoff in 1845 .",
    "they rely on three fundamental hypotheses .",
    "two of them are energy and charge conservation leading respectively to the so - called voltage and current laws .",
    "the third one is ohm s law which states that the current @xmath0 along a wire @xmath1 of the network is proportional to the voltage drop between the vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 connected by this wire  : @xmath4 @xmath5 being the length of the wire , @xmath6 its cross section and @xmath7 the drude conductivity .",
    "we now understand that this third hypothesis relies on the assumption of diffusive motion of the charge carriers at the microscopic level , within a classical description . in particular",
    ", it is not appropriate to describe quantum effects ( like aharanov - bohm effect ) or non - diffusive regime ( ballistic regime , quantum hall effect ) .",
    "after the fundamental breakthrough proposed by rolf landauer to describe the electrical conductance as a transmission coefficient , a generalization of laws of transport beyond classical transport was highly desirable .",
    "it has been formalized in a beautiful work by markus bttiker  ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the regime of linear transport , a convenient description is to start by introducing the conductance matrix @xmath8 which relates the currents at the contacts ( also called terminals ) of the circuit to the values of the voltage at these terminals @xmath9 this relation is completely general in the limit of linear transport .",
    "the two first kirchhoff s laws imply  : @xmath10 expressing the conservation of current , and the invariance of the current distribution against a global shift of the potentials ( gauge invariance ) . as a generalization of landauer s formula ,",
    "elements of the conductance matrix are related to transmission coefficients @xmath11 where the factor @xmath12 stands for the spin degeneracy . at this level ,",
    "the formalism is completely general and no hypothesis is made on the nature of electrical transport which is totally encoded in the transmission coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "these coefficients are related to the scattering matrix which may be determined explicitly within specific models .",
    "for example , in the regime of the integer quantum hall effect , the current is carried by edge states which makes the problem effectively one - dimensional and allows for a simple construction of the scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "more generally , the scattering matrix may be constructed efficiently by assuming strictly one - dimensional character , like in a network of strictly one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires @xcite .",
    "another powerful approach applies to devices in which the electron dynamics can be considered as ergodic , leading to a random matrix formulation of quantum scattering @xcite . in the present article , we consider the case of metallic samples made of weakly disordered wires such that the electron dynamics is _ diffusive _ , as it is the case in narrow metallic wires deposited on a substrate @xcite ( see also the recent experiments @xcite ) , or wires etched in a two - dimensional - electron gas  @xcite .",
    "is the ratio of the voltage between two contacts @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the current injected at contact @xmath14 and collected at contact @xmath15.__,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    bttiker emphasized the importance of the measurement process when a quantum circuit is connected to the outside macroscopic world  @xcite .",
    "the measured resistance is not only a property of the system itself but also depends on the way it is connected to the outside world .",
    "moreover , although the concept of conductance is natural from a theoretical point of view , experiments most frequently deal with voltage measurements  : current is injected and collected at two specific contacts and voltages are measured at any pair on contacts playing the role of _ voltage probes _",
    "[ fig:4tr ] ) .",
    "therefore , the relevant quantities characterizing the response of the device are the four - terminal resistances defined as @xmath16 by appropriate inversion of relation ( [ eq : idev ] ) , bttiker could relate the four - terminal resistances to the elements of the conductance matrix , therefore to the transmission coefficients  @xcite  : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is any minor of the dimensionless conductance matrix .",
    "the expression is valid when all indices are different .    in this paper , we are interested in transport properties of mesoscopic diffusive wires , where quantum interferences lead to small deviations to ohm s law .",
    "this is the so - called _ weak - localisation regime_. for classical transport , simple application of ohm s law leads to the expression of the transmission coefficients , which amounts to classical addition of resistances and conductances ( kirchhoff ) .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the elements of a matrix which encodes the conductances of all the links of the network , defined below in eq ..    for a single wire of length @xmath19 , it is well - known that the weak - localisation correction to the classical transmission coefficient can be written as  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an average over disorder configurations .",
    "the so - called cooperon @xmath22 measures the contribution of interfering closed electronic diffusive trajectories .",
    "we have shown that in a network of diffusive wires , this simple relation generalizes to  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 labels all the wires of the network .",
    "@xmath25 is the localisation length  . ] in the infinitely long wire with @xmath26 conducting channels  @xcite , @xmath27 the elastic mean free path and @xmath28 a dimensionless parameter of order unity , which will be given below .    from the knowledge of the quantum corrections",
    ", we will show in this paper that the quantum correction to the classical four - terminal resistance is @xmath29 this expression is quite simple since the weights attached to each wire have a simple interpretation  : they express the sensitivity of the classical four - terminal resistance when the resistance of this wire is modified .",
    "similarly we have found convenient expressions for the correlation functions of the transmission coefficients , from which one can obtain the correlation functions of the four - terminal conductances . like the weak - localisation correction , these expressions involve contribution of all the wires , which are weighted by similar factors @xmath30 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4trcorrel1],[eq:4trcorrel2],[eq:4trcorrel3],[eq:4trcorrel4 ] ) .",
    "these equations , which are , with eq .  , the main results of the article , will be illustrated by several examples in simple devices .    before going specifically to the analysis of quantum transport in networks of quasi one - dimensional weakly disordered wires , we close the section with some general remarks as the concept of four - terminal resistance ( 4tr ) , of",
    "which bttiker has been one of the main promotors , has been extremely fruitful in mesoscopic physics .",
    "let us mention few directions  :    * in the early developments of the landauer - bttiker approach , the concept of four - terminal resistance has helped clarifying the question of contact resistance .",
    "the concept of contact resistance is the `` mesoscopic version '' of the electric resistance appearing when the electronic fluid is injected from a macroscopic conductor into a small hole ( known as sharvin resistance @xcite ) .",
    "the role of contact resistances has been nicely explained in several papers of bttiker @xcite ( see also chapter  5 of  @xcite ) . * a fundamental aspect of quantum transport concerns the symmetry of transport coefficients  : symmetry with respect to current sources and voltage probes exchange , and symmetry with respect to the reversal of the magnetic field @xmath31 . extending these ideas to coherent conductors",
    ", bttiker has demonstrated the symmetry relation for the 4trs  @xcite @xmath32 * the concept of 4tr provides an illuminating description of the integer quantum hall effect @xcite from the edge state picture introduced by halperin @xcite , as it allows to compute straightforwardly the longitudinal and hall resistances ( see also bttiker s beautiful review article @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , this framework permits to analyze in simple terms other more subbtle effects , like the scattering between edge states at opposite boundaries due to a constriction , leading to so - called anomalous hall effect  @xcite , or by impurities @xcite , the description of transport in a hall cross @xcite , etc . *",
    "another issue which has been put forward by bttiker with others , and which will be central in the present article , concerns the _ nonlocal _ nature of quantum transport , and the influence of voltage probes on the transport properties of a coherent conductor .",
    "motivated by a set of experiments in multiconnected metallic wires @xcite ( see also whasburn and webb s review @xcite ) , various authors have analyzed the role of voltage probes in devices made of disordered wires by various approaches  : maekawa , isawa and ebisawa @xcite , bttiker @xcite , divincenzo , kane and lee @xcite , chandrasekhar , prober and santhanam @xcite , hershfield and ambegaokar @xcite .",
    "a more general discussion of nonlocality of weak localisation in networks of metallic wires was made possible within the theory developed by us in ref .",
    "@xcite . our formalism has allowed us to study how altshuler - aronov - spivak oscillations of the magnetoconductance are affected by the network geometry @xcite ( this was beautifully demonstrated by earlier experiments in arrays of lithium rings by bishop , dolan and licini @xcite ) , or the role of electronic interactions @xcite .    the outline of the paper is as follows  : in the next section we introduce a classical description of electronic transport in networks of metallic wires .",

    "the relation between the two matrices is thus @xmath380 , where @xmath381 is the projector on the vector @xmath382 , where @xmath383 is the number of contacts .",
    "we write more conveniently  : @xmath384 since we will have to consider differences between potentials at various contacts , the relation @xmath385 will be useful .",

    "as we have discussed in the body of the text , the quantum contributions to the transport coefficients are naturally expressed for the _ conductance _ matrix , as linear response theory provides formulae for the conductivity or the conductance . on the other hand , resistances , which are in general complicated functions of the set of all conductance matrix elements , are more easy to handle in most situations , and usually the relevant quantities in most experiment .",
    "we show in this appendix how one can go from the quantum contributions to the conductance matrix elements to the equivalent contributions to the four - terminal resistances .",
    "let us consider a general quantity , function of the conductance matrix elements @xmath391 , where @xmath392 is a short notation for a function of all matrix elements @xmath393  ; the quantity @xmath394 may be for example a four - terminal resistance .",
    "we now show how the quantum contributions to the quantity @xmath394 can be related to the quantum contributions to the conductance . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to analyze the scaling with the number of channels @xmath26 , which is a large parameter .",
    "( which is simply @xmath395 for a wire of length @xmath19 , with @xmath396 ) , however in a complex network of metallic wires , involving several lengths , there is no unique such parameter . ]",
    "considering the set of conductance matrix elements @xmath397 , the disorder average is given by two contributions  : a classical term and the weak localisation correction  : @xmath398 .",
    "other quantum contributions of interest are the mesoscopic ( sample to sample ) fluctuations , defined by @xmath399 and characterized by the correlation functions @xmath400 .",
    "as we have recalled in the text , the three quantities present the @xmath26 dependences @xmath401 we now deduce two useful properties .      writing @xmath399 , the fluctuation is smaller than the average , @xmath402 , and vanishes on average by definition . as a consequence @xmath403      using this property ,",
    "we can split the average into a classical part and the wl correction  : @xmath404 .",
    "hence the average of the physical quantity takes the form @xmath405 we identity the second term as the weak localisation correction to @xmath394  : @xmath406      if we consider two quantities @xmath394 and @xmath31 functions of the transmissions , following the same lines , we deduce the expression for the correlation function @xmath407      @xmath162 * wl correction to the four - terminal resistances  :* it is now straightforward to get the weak localisation correction to the four - terminal resistance .",
    "we deduce from the property , the average resistance and conductance do not , up to correction of order @xmath408 due to the correlations between transmissions .",
    "however the relation is obviously satisfied for a given realization of disorder  : @xmath409 . ]",
    "@xmath410 . then expanding the conductances as @xmath411 , and using ( [ di4tr ] ) and the property , one get @xmath412 using ( [ eq : texmonprl04 ] ) and once again the equation ( [ di4tr ] ) we finally get .",
