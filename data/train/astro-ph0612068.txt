    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are sources of luminous x - ray emission , and at cosmological distances agn are routinely selected from deep x - ray ( @xmath4kev ) exposures ( @xcite ) .",
    "highly obscured ( @xmath5 ) agn are thought to be a major contributor to the hard x - ray background ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the majority of them might not be detected in these x - ray surveys because a large fraction of their soft x - ray , uv , and optical emission is absorbed , and presumably reradiated in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to detect this population of heavily obscured agn , many of which have focused on the mir emission where the obscured radiation is expected to be reemitted ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or on combinations of mir and multiwavelength data ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the mid - ir , agn can often be distinguished by their characteristic power - law emission ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "this emission is not necessarily due to a single source , but can arise from the combination of non - thermal nuclear emission and thermal emission from various nuclear dust components ( @xcite ) .",
    "we summarize here the properties of galaxies showing the characteristic power - law behavior expected for agn in the _ spitzer _",
    "@xmath0 m bands detected in the _ chandra _ deep field north and south ( cdf - n and cdf - n ) studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we also discuss results from other ir - based methods to detect high-@xmath6 obscured agn .",
    "we use @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we chose two cosmological fields with deep x - ray coverage ( cdf - n : 2ms and cdf - s : 1ms , see @xcite for details ) to look for obscured agn .",
    "we selected as power - law galaxies sources that were detected in each of the four irac ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 m ) bands and whose irac spectra could be fitted as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spectral index .",
    "we used a minimum @xmath14 criterion to select galaxies whose irac seds followed a power law with spectral index @xmath15 .",
    "the choice for the spectral index was based on the empirical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of bright qso selected in the optical , x - rays and near - ir ( e.g. , @xcite ) and seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two slight differences in the two catalogs of ir power - law galaxies . in",
    "the cdf - s @xcite started the selection of the power - law candidates from the @xmath16 m catalog of @xcite , without any further requirements on the flux limits of the irac catalogs .",
    "@xcite in the cdf - n instead imposed a strict s / n@xmath17 flux density cut in each of the irac bands but did not require a @xmath16 m detection , although virtually all of the power - law galaxies in the cdf - n were also detected at @xmath16 m down to @xmath18jy ( equivalent to the 80% completeness limit of the cdf - s , see @xcite ) .    to minimize the chances of selecting non - active galaxies we constructed optical - mir seds ( see  4 ) , and compared them with theoretical and observational templates of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we rejected any source selected via the power - law criteria whose sed resembled a star - forming galaxy .",
    "the final samples included 92 and 62 galaxies in the cdf - s and cdf - n , respectively ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "a small ( @xmath19 , depending on the field ) fraction of the power - law galaxies , typically the optically bright x - ray sources ( see next section ) , have spectroscopic redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite in cdf - s ) .",
    "we supplemented the available spectroscopic redshifts with photometric ones estimated with an improved version of the method described by @xcite .",
    "we find that the ir power - law galaxies tend to lie at significantly higher redshifts ( @xmath20 ) than the x - ray sources ( median @xmath21 , see @xcite for a review ) in both fields .",
    "@xcite and @xcite defined agn selection criteria based on _",
    "spitzer_/irac color - color diagrams .",
    "the lacy et al criterion is based on sdss qsos , and therefore excludes agn in which the host galaxy dominates the mir ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as agn obscured in the mid - ir .",
    "our power - law galaxies fall along a straight line well within the lacy et al diagram , although they do not cover completely the available color space ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the stern et al criteria are based on the observed properties of spectroscopically classified agn , and provide a closer match to our power - law technique . while the color - color selected samples comprise a higher fraction of the low x - ray luminosity agn than does the power - law selected sample , the color criteria select more sources not detected in x - rays , due at least in part to a higher degree of contamination from ulirgs dominated by star formation ( fig .  1 and @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite obtained follow - up optical spectroscopy of objects selected according to @xcite in the _ spitzer _ first look survey and swire xmm - lss fields .",
    "their sample is flux - limited at @xmath16 m , although their objects are much brighter ( @xmath22mjy , median of 5mjy , and median @xmath23-band magnitudes @xmath24mag ) than our power - law galaxies ( @xmath25mjy , and @xmath26mag for those detected by combo-17 see next section ) , and on average their agn are closer @xmath27 compared with @xmath28 for our power - law galaxies .",
    "the location of this sample on the @xcite irac color - color diagram ( figure  7 in @xcite ) is almost identical to the positions of the power - law galaxies shown in fig  1 ( right panel ) .",
    "their selection technique has proven to be very effective at selecting agn as their follow - up spectroscopy shows that approximately 90% have agn signatures with one - third of them showing broad - line regions , thus an obscured - to - unobscured ratio of 2:1 ( see  5 for the power - law galaxies ) .",
    "all these properties seem to indicate that these color - color selected galaxies represent the brightest end of the power - law galaxies .",
    "in both cdf - n and cdf - s we found that approximately 50% of the ir power - law galaxies were detected in at least one _ chandra _ band using the x - ray catalogs of @xcite . in the cdf - s we stacked the x - ray data of a few individually undetected galaxies ( at off - axis angles of @xmath29 ) and found a significant detection in the hard - band ( @xmath30 ) and a tentative detection in the soft band ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "for @xmath32 these would correspond to observed soft and hard luminosities of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with obscured agn . since the x - ray exposure of the cdf - n is twice that of cdf - s we searched for faint x - ray emission at the positions of the power - law galaxies not in the @xcite catalog .",
    "we found that the x - ray detection rate increases to 77% at the @xmath1 level .",
    "the power - law galaxies make up a significant fraction of the high x - ray luminosity sample , as our selection criteria require the agn to be energetically dominant .",
    "the lower luminosity x - ray sources not identified as power - law galaxies tend to be dominated by the @xmath35 m stellar bump in the optical to near - ir bands ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a large fraction of ir luminous high-@xmath6 galaxies have been found to host agn ( e.g. , scuba galaxies @xcite ) , and ir luminous galaxies at @xmath36 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we measured the total ir ( @xmath2 m ) luminosity of the cdf - s power - law galaxies from the rest - frame @xmath37 m luminosity .",
    "although our procedure to compute ir luminosities is similar to that of @xcite , we took special care to use @xmath37 m to ir luminosity ratios specific to the class of galaxies in study .",
    "in particular , galaxies whose seds resemble those of optical qsos ( see  4 and fig .  3 ) show @xmath37 m to ir luminosity ratios significantly lower than the typical values of cool ulirgs and some warm ulirgs ( e.g. , mrk  231 ) .",
    "all the ir power - law galaxies are highly luminous .",
    "about 30% are in the hyperluminous class ( @xmath38 ) , 41% are ulirgs ( @xmath39 ) , and all but one of the rest are lirgs ( @xmath40 ) . at the lower ir luminosity end ( @xmath41 )",
    "a large fraction are detected in x - rays and tend to have seds similar to those of optical qsos ( see next section ) .",
    "about one - quarter of the cdf - s ir power - law galaxies are optically faint i.e. , were not detected by combo-17 ( @xcite ) down to a limit of @xmath42mag .",
    "moreover , the fraction of power - law galaxies not detected in x - rays increases toward fainter @xmath23-band magnitudes ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , an indication of their obscured nature as also revealed by their seds ( see also  5 ) . a number of works ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) have demonstrated that x - ray to optical flux ratios can be useful for distinguishing between agn and star - forming galaxies for sources detected in deep x - ray exposures . fig .",
    "2 ( left panel ) shows that the majority of the galaxies ( or their upper limits ) in the cdf - s are consistent with being agn or transition objects based on the x - ray vs. @xmath23-band diagram ( similar results are found for the cdf - n galaxies ) .",
    "the location of the ir power - law galaxies on this diagram ( see @xcite ) indicates x - ray luminosities ( or upper limits ) above @xmath43 , as also shown by the right panel of fig .  2 .",
    "the rest - frame hard x - ray/@xmath37 m ratios of the ir power - law galaxies are similar to those of local warm ulirgs ( i.e. , those containing an agn ) and qso .     included in the sample of predominantly star - forming galaxies selected at @xmath16 m by @xcite .",
    ", width=445 ]",
    "using available multiwavelength datasets ( see @xcite for references ) of the two cosmological fields we constructed seds for our sample .",
    "the spectroscopic classifications ( broad vs. narrow lines ) tend to agree with two distinct types of seds . about 40% of the cdf - s ir",
    "power - law galaxies detected in x - rays are classified as blagn and have seds ( fig .",
    "3 ) similar to the average radio - quiet qso sed of @xcite , that is , with an optical  to  mid - ir continuum almost flat in @xmath44 with a uv bump .",
    "the remaining x - ray sources with narrow lines ( nlagn ) have seds similar to the blagn but their uv and optical continua are much steeper ( obscured ) , and some of them resemble local warm ulirgs .",
    "the majority of the power - law galaxies not detected in x - rays ( fig .",
    "4 ) have steep seds similar to the nlagn or ulirg class as they tend to be optically fainter ( see  3 ) and possibly more obscured ( see  5 ) than the x - ray sources .",
    "in contrast with our power - law galaxies , massive galaxies from the virmos vlt deep survey ( vvds , @xcite ) at @xmath45 with @xmath16 m detections from the sample of @xcite are predominantly star - forming galaxies with a prominent stellar bump at @xmath35 m due to an evolved ( red giants and supergiants ) stellar population . moreover , the seds of power - law galaxies are also significantly different from those of the majority of optically - dull agn in the cdf - s which show seds dominated by stellar light originating in the host galaxy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "4 shows the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) acs ( @xcite ) observed optical morphologies of optically - bright power - law galaxies in the cdf - s .",
    "the power - law galaxies spectroscopically classified as blagn ( and sed type ) display bright nuclear point sources suggesting that the optical light is dominated by the agn , which is consistent with the fact that our power - law criteria selects the most x - ray luminous agn ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the power - law galaxies without broad lines ( those classified as hex or lex by @xcite ) have disky or irregular morphologies .",
    "a morphological characterization of the ir power - law galaxies not detected in x - rays is difficult as only about half of them are detected in the goods / acs images and they are faint . as can be seen for a few examples in fig .",
    "4 they have irregular , knotty , and/or interacting morphologies , and do not appear to contain bright point sources .",
    "in the distant universe the x - ray background and luminosity synthesis models predict global obscured ( @xmath46 ) to unobscured ratios of 3:1 to 4:1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , significantly higher than the observed ratios of spectroscopically identified x - ray sources in deep fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) including those detected in the mid - ir ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the intrinsic column densities of each of the x - ray well detected and weakly x - ray emitting power - law galaxies in the cdf - n .",
    "we also included a few cdf - s ir power - law galaxies ( @xcite ) for which @xcite estimated the x - ray column densities .",
    "the column density distribution of the power - law galaxies ( fig .",
    "7 ) is significantly different from that of optically bright x - ray agn with spectroscopic classifications ( see also @xcite ) , including the optically - dull agn which are believed to suffer strong obscuration ( @xcite ) . from fig .",
    "7 it is clear that the weakly detected ir power - law galaxies are consistent with being obscured ( @xmath47 ) but not compton - thick ( @xmath48 ) . if all the x - ray non - detected power - law galaxies",
    "are obscured , the maximum obscured ratio is 4:1 ( for the cdf - n power - law galaxies ) .",
    "this @xmath49-based obscured fraction of power - law galaxies agrees well with the ratio of blagn ( unobscured ) sed vs. nlagn ( obscured ) seds found in the cdf - s .",
    "we can finally estimate the ratio of obscured to unobscured mid - ir detected agn in the cdf - s .",
    "the unobscured agn are all those x - ray sources ( detected in the hard band to make sure they are agn ) with @xmath50 , whereas in the obscured category we include all obscured x - ray sources with @xmath51 , and all the obscured ir power - law galaxies .",
    "we find an observed ratio of obscured to unobscured agn of 2:1 in the cdf - s .",
    "comparing with the predictions of @xcite for the @xmath16 m detected agn number density we find that our sample of power - law galaxies only accounts for approximately 20% of all the mid - ir emitting obscured agn in the cdf - n .",
    "this fraction can be as high as @xmath52 in the cdf - s as a result of larger sample of power - law galaxies there ( we did not impose irac high s / n detections , see  2 and @xcite for details ) . the remainder should have seds dominated by or strongly affected by the host galaxy or red power - law seds that fall below the irac detection limit .",
    "this is not surprising as our power - law criteria require the agn to be energetically dominant in the near to mid - ir .",
    "the selection of ir - bright optically - faint galaxies has been suggested as another method for identifying obscured agn ( @xcite ) , although the selection criteria ( @xmath53 and @xmath54mjy ) were set so that irs follow - up spectroscopy could be obtained .",
    "these criteria select mostly high-@xmath6 ( median @xmath55 ) galaxies , with only a small fraction showing the characteristic aromatic feature emission of star formating galaxies .",
    "the majority have irs spectra similar to local agn - dominated ulirgs with either a featureless power - law rest - frame mid - ir continuum or deep silicate features at @xmath56 m .",
    "in addition , their seds lack a strong @xmath35 m stellar bump , and are similar to those of ir power - law galaxies .",
    "their properties are consistent with being optically obscured agn - powered ulirgs with @xmath57 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "only a few galaxies in the cdf - n and cdf - s fall within the @xcite flux density cuts .",
    "we can instead compare with the @xmath16m/@xmath11 m vs. @xmath16m/@xmath23-band diagram criterion proposed by @xcite to select obscured agn .",
    "the location of our cdf - n power - law galaxies on this diagram can be seen in fig .",
    "we also show the comparison x - ray sources ( from @xcite ) and other irac sources in the field that do not meet the power - law criteria .",
    "we find that all these samples cover a large range in colors , but the power - law galaxies comprise a significant fraction ( @xmath58 ) of the highly optically reddened members of the comparison x - ray sample .",
    "this suggests that the power - law selection is capable of detecting both optically obscured and unobscured agn , and that a large fraction of the ir - bright / optically - faint sources in the comparison sample have power - law seds in the near and mid - ir ( fig .",
    "radio emission is another good way to select agn as it is unaffected by dust absorption .",
    "@xcite in the cdf - n used a radio to mid - ir ratio to select galaxies that are too bright in radio to be star - forming galaxies .",
    "they found that @xmath59% of their radio - loud agn are not detected in x - rays suggesting strong obscuration .",
    "@xcite looked for a population of radio intermediate and radio quiet agn by selecting @xmath16 m sources ( @xmath60mjy ) with radio emission and imposed a flux density cut at @xmath61 m to filter out type-1 and radio - loud qsos .",
    "they found a population of qsos at @xmath62 ( median @xmath32 , the epoch of qso maximum activity ) with a ratio of obscured to unobscured of ( @xmath63):1 , and postulated that this population of obscured agn may be responsible for most of the black hole growth in the young universe .",
    "m over @xmath23-band flux ratio.,width=453 ]",
    "deep x - ray cosmological surveys are efficient at detecting agn at high-@xmath6 but they only account for a @xmath64 1:1 ratio of obscured - to - unobscured agn , whereas synthesis models of the x - ray background require ratios of between 3:1 and 4:1 .",
    "thus there is a significant population of obscured ( @xmath65 ) agn being missed by current deep x - ray ( @xmath4kev ) observations .",
    "we describe searches for this population .",
    "our selection criterion is based on the characteristic ir power - law emission shown by local qsos . by selecting galaxies with power - law emission in the _ spitzer_/irac bands ( @xmath66 m )",
    "we avoid high-@xmath6 galaxies whose seds are dominated by stellar emission and star formation peaking at @xmath35 m .",
    "only @xmath67% of ir power - law galaxies are detected in deep ( @xmath68ms ) x - ray exposures .",
    "this fraction increases to 75% if we include weakly detected x - ray sources at the @xmath1 level in the field with the deepest x - ray exposure ( cdf - n ) .",
    "the optical ( faint ) , ir ( mostly ulirgs and hyper luminous ir galaxies ) , and x - ray properties , the x - ray column densities @xmath49 ( moderately obscured , but not compton - thick ) and redshift ( @xmath20 ) distributions , and sed shapes of a large fraction ( up to @xmath69 ) of ir power - law galaxies are significantly different from bright x - ray selected agn .",
    "this may indicate that a large fraction of ir power - law galaxies are good candidates to host obscured agn , and could account for a ratio of 2:1 of obscured - to - unobscured agn at high-@xmath6 .",
    "other mid - ir based criteria ( e.g. , @xcite ) are also finding populations of obscured agn",
    ". there might be a significant overlap between populations of bright mid - ir agn selected with all these methods , and thus a complete census of the _ entire _ obscured agn population is needed to determine whether we can account for the obscured fraction of the x - ray background .",
