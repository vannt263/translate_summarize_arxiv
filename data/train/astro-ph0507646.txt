    "star clusters , we explore the feasibility of detecting directly the low mass pre  main sequence stars in young stellar populations . in section",
    "ii , we outline our approach to simulating the integrated near ",
    "ir light from very young rich star  forming events . in section iii , we discuss our results as a function of input model assumptions , and in section iv we discuss the uncertainties in constraining the ratio of high to low mass stars using the technique described here .",
    "we have simulated the integrated near  infrared spectrum from a stellar population using the assumptions outlined below .",
    "first , we assume single star  forming events with total mass 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 populated in monte carlo fashion by either a salpeter ( 1955 ; hereafter s55 ) or chabrier ( 2003 ; hereafter c03 ) imf from 0.1100 m@xmath3 at ages of 1 , 3 , and 10 myr .",
    "we take into account the effects of main sequence and post  main sequence evolution using starburst99 ( leitherer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this program also includes nebular emission that results from interaction of the ionizing flux from the most massive stars formed with the surrounding medium as it evolves along with the ensemble radiation field . because we are interested in detecting low mass stars directly as a fraction of the integrated light in the near  infrared , the high mass stars and nebular emission . ]",
    "simply provide a featureless continuum against which we wish to detect spectral features from late  type stars .",
    "we also include , for the first time , the effects of _ pre  main sequence _",
    "( pms ) evolution explicitly on the integrated light of the stellar population .",
    "we use the models of seiss et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to provide appropriate mass  luminosity relationships as a function of time over a broad range of stellar masses . for populations",
    "1/3/10 myr old , all stars @xmath0 7/5/3 m@xmath3 are pms respectively .",
    "this corresponds to 0.971/0.956/0.911 % of all stars with total masses of of approximately 0.69/0.63/0.51 @xmath6 the cluster mass in the pms component for 1/3/10 myr respectively ( assuming a chabrier , 2003 imf ) .",
    "we adopt tables of intrinsic colors and bolometric corrections as a function of effective temperature and spectral type from cox ( 2000 ) and use these to estimate the contribution of each pms star to the integrated j ( 1.25 @xmath4 m ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath4 m ) , and k  band ( 2.2 @xmath4 m ) light . for each star ,",
    "a mass is assigned based on probabilities from the input imf .",
    "for the assumed age , this translates into a temperature and bolometric luminosity . for the model temperature ,",
    "a color and bolometric correction is adopted resulting in a calculated absolute m@xmath7 , m@xmath8 , and m@xmath9 magnitude . based on this temperature ,",
    "we select a continuum normalized snr @xmath1 50 spectrum at r=1000 from the library of meyer ( 1996 ) with weighting according to its absolute flux to produce the integrated pms spectrum for the low mass stars .",
    "we then combined the pms spectrum with the appropriately flux  weighted continuum from starburst99 for the high mass main sequence and post  main sequence stars , along with the nebular continuum to produce the total integrated spectrum of the population as a function of age ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the integrated pms spectra shown in figure 1 exhibit late  type features due to cai at 2.26 @xmath4 m and the first  overtone co absorption at 2.29 and 2.32 @xmath4 m ( prominent in stars @xmath5 k0 ) as well as features of mgi at 2.28 @xmath4 m ( seen in stars from f2m1 ) as noted by ali et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , hinkle and wallace ( 1997 ) , and kleinmann and hall ( 1986 ) . while these features are difficult to see against the continuum of the high mass stars and nebular emission , they are detected at the 1 % level in high signal  to  noise ratio spectra .",
    "table 1 shows the breakdown of relative flux in the j , h , and k  bands as a function of age and input imf .",
    "the nebular continuum dominates at the youngest ages and becomes less important with time ( leitherer et al .",
    "however , the low mass stars are also brightest at the youngest ages due to their pms nature , partially off  setting the effect of strong nebular continuum .",
    "it appears that the low mass pms stars contribute a roughly constant fraction to the integrated k  band flux from @xmath0 1 to @xmath5 3 myr ( @xmath5 0.07 to @xmath0 0.04 for the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf ) though this effect is commonly ignored .",
    "once the most massive stars evolve to become m supergiants at an age of @xmath1 8 myr years , they dominate the continuum and the pms stars become @xmath0 1 % of the integrated k  band flux making them almost impossible to detect .",
    "however , at ages @xmath0 8 myr , the low mass stars are detectable through the co absorption features against the continuum of the high mass stars and nebular continuum .    we have investigated the diagnostic power of the spectral features indicated in figure 1 by measuring the equivalent width of the features as a function of age and input imf using the splot routine within iraf .",
    "variations in determining the local continuum for each spectral feature provide the error estimates in the equivalent widths . as can be seen in table 2 , the combined strength of the ( cai+co ) indices , which are dominated by stars cooler than 3500 k and less than 0.5 m@xmath3 from ages 13 myr ( siess et al . 2000 ) , decrease by factors of 2.13 ( s55 ) and 3.28 ( c03 ) as the populations age and the low mass stars become less luminous .",
    "note that the combined index evolves more from 13 myr for c03 ( shallower imf ) compared to s55 since it is more sensitive to stars 0.20.5 m@xmath3 , whose luminosities are evolving faster than the stars @xmath0 0.2 m@xmath3 . the mgi index , tracing stars with temperatures between 37007000 k , is the same for both imfs at 1 myr where it is dominated by stars @xmath5 1.0 m@xmath3 ( siess et al . 2000 ) : at high masses the imf slopes are the same . again",
    "because this index is dominated by higher mass stars from the c03 imf whose luminosities are changing faster , it changes more from 13 myr compared to s55 ( factors of 3.36 versus 2.61 ) .",
    "note that the mass range sampled by the mgi feature , attributed to warmer stars compared to the cai+co index , decreases with time from with the upper mass limit going from 4 m@xmath3 ( 1 myr ) to 2.5 m@xmath3 ( 3 myr ) .",
    "while the equivalent width ratio given in the last column of table 2 @xmath10+ew[co 2 - 0)])/ew[mgi]$ ] does not evolve significantly from 13 myr for the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , both values are distinguished from the range of values realized from the s55 imf .",
    "the difference between the 1 myr s55 value and the 3 myr old c03 value is @xmath11 .",
    "although the snr of the spectra required in order to accurately measure the weak mgi feature probably exceeds 300 at r = 1000 , our simulations suggest that we can distinguish between the c03 and s55 imfs at the @xmath1 3 @xmath12 level provided we can estimate the age of the stellar population to within a factor of three .",
    "we have demonstrated that , given our model assumptions are correct , it should be possible to discern the presence of the low mass stars in a very young unresolved stellar population .",
    "this would place important constraints on the ratio of high to low mass stars , and thus the imf , in extreme star  forming environments .",
    "we now examine how sensitive the conclusions presented above are to the assumptions we have made .",
    "would utilizing different pms evolutionary calculations make a difference ? replacing the mass  luminosity  temperature relationships of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as a function of age with those of palla and stahler ( 2000 ) or dantona mazzitelli ( 1994 ) would result in a change of @xmath0 10 % in the absolute k  band magnitude of a 1 m@xmath3 star at an age of 1 myr .",
    "while there are larger uncertainties in the pms evolutionary models at lower masses ( e.g. hillenbrand and white , 2004 ) , the qualitative behavior of the models within our simulations will be the same .",
    "we have assumed that starburst99 correctly predicts the amount of nebular continuum for the unresolved population .",
    "the prescription used is described in leitherer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and assumes that all ionizing photons contribute with high efficiency to producing the observed free  free emission .",
    "we considered the effects of changing the maximum stellar mass from 100 m@xmath3 to 130 and 200 m@xmath3 in our model stellar clusters . moving the maximum mass to 130 m@xmath3 made only a 1.3 % decrease to our prediction for the integrated k ",
    "band contribution from pms stars to 5.7 % ( increasing the continuum dilution of the late  type absorption features ) , while increasing the maximum mass to 200 m@xmath3 decreased the integrated k  band light to 5.4 % for a 1 myr old population assuming a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf ( cf .",
    "table i ) .",
    "oey and clarke ( 2005 ) have presented evidence for a universal maximum stellar mass between 120200 m@xmath3 while figer ( 2005 ) suggests a maximum observed stellar mass of 130 m@xmath3 based on observations of the arches cluster ( see massey , 1999 for an alternative point of view ) .",
    "further , if , as is observed in some star  forming complexes , the hii region has broken out of the molecular cloud over an appreciable solid angle , the estimated free ",
    "free continuum is an upper limit , making our predicted line strengths for low mass stars a lower limit .",
    "we have also neglected the presence of circumstellar disks which could produce an additional veiling continuum further diluting the observed late ",
    "type stellar features from low mass stars .",
    "however , not all young stellar objects exhibit excess continuum emission at 2.3 @xmath4 m and typical excess emission appears to peak at longer wavelengths ( meyer et al .",
    "1997 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "further we have also underestimated the absorption line strength of the co feature , which is surface gravity sensitive , as we have used higher gravity dwarf star templates to represent lower gravity pms objects .",
    "these two effects tend to cancel .",
    "how does our choice of r=1000 affect the detectable of the low mass stars ? while lower spectral resolution might make it easier to detect the spectral features ( nyquist sampled at r @xmath5 300 ) at the required snr , it may be important to obtain higher resolution spectra in order to constrain the surface gravity of the dominant stellar population responsible for the stellar absorption .",
    "if any supergiant stars contribute to the integrated light observed at 2.3 @xmath4 m , r @xmath0 3000 spectra should enable their identification due to the extremely low surface gravity , to which co is sensitive ( aaronson et al .",
    "1978 ; meyer et al . 1998 ) . in this preliminary work",
    ", we have ignored the effects of metalicity .",
    "starburst galaxies are thought to have higher than solar metalicity , which would increase the absorption line strengths predicted in our simulations .",
    "one degeneracy in constraining the slope of the imf with which we must contend is that between the ratio of high to low mass stars and the luminosity of the pms population as a function of age ( see table 1 ) . if one assumed an age of 3 myr for what was actually a 1 myr old cluster , one might erroneously favor a steeper imf ( e.g. s55 ) rather than a c03 imf based on analysis of the ca+co absorption strength alone",
    "however , the line ratio analysis outlined above can distinguish between imfs with powerlaw indices that differ by @xmath1 1.0 dex above and below 1 m@xmath3 ( e.g. between s55 and c03 ) provided that the age of the stellar population can be constrained within a factor of @xmath6 3 . recent work on modelling the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of",
    "starburst galaxies suggest that ages for them can be derived within factors of @xmath6 3 given @xmath5 four points on the sed including the u and b  bands as well as near  ir data ( anders et al .",
    "in addition , it is vital to know whether or not the cluster might contain supergiants ( corresponding to ages @xmath5 8 myr ) which will dominate the near  ir continuum once they appear . vazquez and leitherer ( 2005 ) present model seds for very young starbursts that indicate it is relatively straight  forward to distinguish clusters @xmath0 and @xmath5 10 myr based on the energy emitted between 3001000 @xmath13 despite the uncertainties in the theoretical models .",
    "further , gonalez delgado and prez ( 2000 ) show that results from sed modelling which include uv data agree well with other techniques and give a consistent age of 3 myr for the stellar populations associated with the hii region ngc 604 in m 33 .",
    "how can we treat uncertainties in the level of free  free emission ? rather than rely on the model predictions outlined above for the relative ratios of nebular emission to stellar emission , it would be very valuable to constrain the amount of nebular emission through observations .",
    "since free  free emission from such a young stellar population becomes increasingly dominant at longer wavelengths , one could measure the free  free emission directly at centimeter wavelengths where it is expected to dominate dust and compare the inferred amount in the near  ir to the predictions of starburst99 .",
    "spatially resolved observations of the hii regions in m17 by ando et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate qualitative agreement between observed ir emission and predicted free  free emission extrapolated from centimeter observations .",
    "an additional check on this extrapolation would be the predicted reddening corrected br @xmath14 line flux given the observed free ",
    "free emission .",
    "if one is able to detect the weak mgi feature discussed above , the line ratio suggested in table 2 would render the measurement insensitive to uncertainties in the continuum veiling due to free  free emission .",
    "removal of the free  free contribution to the observed near  ir spectrum and a model of the integrated stellar spectrum would place a direct constraint of the ratio of high to low mass stars .",
    "such constraints are sensitive to the relative slope of the imf between 10100 m@xmath3 and 0.11.0 m@xmath3 , crucial for precise estimates of the mass  to  light ratios for older stellar populations .",
    "is this observational approach feasible ?",
    "several candidate super ",
    "star clusters found in the overlap region of the interacting galaxy pair ngc 4038/39 exhibit weak co absorption and are thought to be @xmath0 10 myr old ( mengel et al .",
    "2002 ) indicating that they lack late  type supergiants .",
    "these targets have k  band magnitudes between 14@xmath15 ( kassin et al .",
    "we estimate that it would take @xmath1 10 hours at r @xmath1 1000 to obtain snr @xmath1 300 in the k  band to detect late  type features from low mass stars in a @xmath16 young super  star cluster on an 8 meter telescope .",
    "added information available through spectral observations in the j and h  bands may make application of this technique easier .",
    "despite all the caveats listed above , we believe the experiment is worthwhile , given the important implications of the observations .",
    "we would like to thank the claus leitherer for the helpful suggestion that we investigate the effects of free  free emission on the integrated spectra of starbursts at young ages , as well as an anonymous referee for suggestions that improved the presentation of this paper .",
    "we also thank the organizers of the imf@50 conference ( evidge corbelli , franscesco palla , and hans zinnecker ) for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this work at the abetto de spinoza , and morten andersen along with kelsey johnson for comments on a draft of the paper .",
