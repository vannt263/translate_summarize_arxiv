    "@xcite indicates that instanton effects could also trigger chiral symmetry breaking at comparably large value of @xmath12 .",
    "besides being of theoretical interest , the physics of a chiral transition could have consequences for electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , since near - critical gauge theories provide a natural framework for walking technicolor theories @xcite .    if a phase transition is second order , a useful approach is to find a tractable model in the same universality class .",
    "for chiral symmetry , a natural order parameter is the @xmath13 complex matrix field @xmath14 describing mesonic degrees of freedom .",

    "for the zero - temperature transition as a function of @xmath1 , a similar approach might also be tried .",
    "it was suggested in ref.@xcite , however , that while the order parameter vanishes continuously as @xmath16 , the transition is not second order . with the gap equation dominated by an infrared fixed point of the gauge theory ,",
    "the transition was argued to be continuous but infinite order .",
    "it has also been noted @xcite that because of the associated long range conformal symmetry , the masses of all the physical states , not just the scalar mesons are expected to scale to zero with the order parameter .    in this paper",
    "we nevertheless suggest that an effective potential using only the low lying mesonic degrees of freedom might be employed to model at least some aspects of the zero - temperature chiral phase transition .",
