    "consider a semi - transparent mirror , the glass of your window , for example .",
    "the mirror partially reflects light and is partially transparent .",
    "if the material of the mirror is not absorptive the incident light is exactly split into the reflected and the transmitted component .",
    "now , light consists of photons , of indivisible light particles . how does this beam splitter act on individual photons @xcite ?",
    "how are photons split ? or , in another experiment @xcite , suppose you take a semi - silvered mirror with 50:50 transmission - reflection ratio .",
    "you let exactly one photon propagate towards the frontside of the mirror and you send another single photon towards the backside , and let them interfere .",
    "the interference between two light beams depends on their relative phase . if the phase difference is right , the sum of the two incident beams , the two photons , emerge behind the mirror and if they interfere with the opposite phase they appear in front of the mirror .",
    "but single photons are not supposed to carry a precise phase , because phase is a wave property and individual photons are particles .",
    "so what happens @xcite ?",
    "such conundrums are beginning to occupy people s minds for other reasons than purely academic curiosity , because they may fundamentally alter our approach to secure data communication @xcite .",
    "suppose that alice wants to send a secret message to bob , carried by photons in a glass fiber @xcite or through space @xcite .",
    "eve , the eavesdropper , tries to intercept the message without getting caught . clearly ,",
    "in order to do so , she must probe the stream of messenger photons , for example using something like a beam splitter .",
    "however , knowing the principal quantum effects of beam splitters , alice and bob may infer from the statistical properties of the transmitted photons that their secrecy is at risk and may discard the communication channel . in a more sophisticated eavesdropping attempt , eve might amplify the incident light and extract , by beam splitting , the bits that are sufficient for her .",
    "the rest , with the same amplitude as the original , is transmitted to bob .",
    "would alice and bob notice eve s subtle interception ?",
    "the quantum physics of simple optical instruments , such as beam splitters and amplifiers , is clearly important when the quantum nature of light is used for practical ( or academic ) purposes . equally importantly , some seemingly simple questions about light and the relatively simple experiments to demonstrate their intriguing answers do both illuminate and challenge our understanding of the quantum world @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in studying the quantum physics of simple optical instruments we may see connections to a much wider and sometimes quite exotic range of physics .",
    "for example , the hawking radiation of black holes @xcite is related to the quantum optics of moving media and combines aspects of beam splitters and amplifiers .    in this article",
    "we analyze the principles of quantum - optical networks where two or more beams of light interact with each other .",
    "the networks are assumed to be linear in the sense that the output amplitudes depend on the input amplitudes by a linear transformation , although the physics of such networks may be based on non - linear optics @xcite .",
    "the article is intended as a primer , as a nearly self - consistent tutorial , rather than a literature survey .",
    "the reader should be familiar with basic quantum mechanics and statistics , and perhaps with optics and some elementary field theory .",
    "however , when appropriate , we quote the major mathematical results needed , instead of deriving them , for not overburdening this article .",
    "we use the notation of the book @xcite and some of the basic results of quantum optics explained there .",
    "first we begin with an example , quantum light in planar dielectrics",
    ". then we extend the central features of this example to quantum - optical networks in general .",
    "we describe the quantum physics of such networks in the heisenberg picture and in the schrdinger picture , and with the help of quasiprobability distributions such as the wigner function @xcite . in sec .",
    "4 we develop the quantum optics of the beam splitter , because this simple device is the archetype of all passive optical instruments , and because the beam splitter is capable of demonstrating many interesting aspects of the wave - particle dualism . in sec .",
    "5 we analyze absorbers and amplifiers , which are irreversible devices , and show how they can be described by effective models , such as fictitious beam splitters and parametric amplifiers . in sec .",
    "6 we develop the quantum theory of parametric amplifiers and phase - conjugating mirrors .",
    "parametric amplifiers have been widely used to experimentally demonstrate the nonlocality of quantum mechanics in versions of the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox @xcite .",
    "section 7 returns to the starting point , to quantum light in dielectric media .",
    "we show how moving media may establish analogs of black holes and we analyze the essentials of hawking radiation @xcite . throughout this article ,",
    "whenever possible , we try to use models that are simple but not too simple .",
    "many passive optical instruments such as lenses or beam splitters consist of dielectric materials like glass that influence the propagation of light without causing much absorption .",
    "dielectrics are linear - response media  their effect on light is proportional to the electromagnetic field strengths .",
    "the field induces microscopic dipoles in the atoms constituting the dielectric medium .",
    "the dipoles constitute macroscopic electric polarizations and magnetizations that are proportional to the applied electromagnetic field and which act back onto the field .",
    "an isotropic medium is characterized by two spatially dependent proportionality factors , the electric permittivity @xmath0 and the magnetic permeability @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we assume that the medium is not dispersive and not dissipative . in this case",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are real and do not depend on the frequency of light within the frequency window we are considering . the square root of the product of @xmath0 and @xmath1 gives the refractive index that describes the degree to which the phase velocity of light in the medium deviates from the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath2 .",

    "optical instruments act primarily on the classical wave - like properties of light . in the regime of far - field optics ,",
    "the instrument is spatially well separated from the light sources and from the places where the light is detected or otherwise applied to . in this situation , we can decompose both the incident light and the outgoing light into plane waves .",

    ", the transfer matrix does not directly describe how the two incident light modes interfere with each other to produce the outgoing modes .",
    "in one spatial dimension , the directions of light propagation are fairly restricted  the incident light can come from the left or from the right of the dielectric structure .",
    "waves incident from the left , @xmath67 , are partially reflected and partially transmitted , but beyond the structure the waves must propagate to the right .",

    "the two sets of modes are adapted to two distinct physical situations  the incident modes refer to quantum light that enters the dielectric structure from outside , whereas the outgoing modes are the ones that leave the structure .",
    "the scattering matrix completely characterizes a perfect piece of dielectric structure in the regime of far - field optics , describing how incident light beams are transformed into outgoing beams . in one spatial dimension ,",

    "one often tries to operate with as few modes as possible .",
    "much care is spent on aligning the equipment to make sure that most of the quantum light of interest is indeed captured in a few well - controlled modes . on the other hand",
    ", one can construct , in a controlled way , optical networks , also called multiports @xcite , from the basic building blocks such as beam splitters and mirrors @xcite , networks with interesting quantum properties , in particular in the limit when many elements are involved @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we could add phase - conjugating mirrors @xcite or parametric amplifiers @xcite to our catalogue of simple optical instruments , although they are experimentally less simple than dielectric structures .",
    "parametric amplifiers @xcite and phase - conjugating mirrors @xcite are active devices  they require a source of energy , mostly light of a higher frequency .",
    "yet these active devices share a key property with the passive instruments  they are linear devices in the sense that the input modes are linear transformations of the output modes .",
    "however , this linear transformation may involve the hermitian conjugated mode operators .",
    "a phase - conjugating mirror , for example , produces the complex - conjugated image of the incident wave front @xmath22 , which , in quantum optics , is associated with the hermitian conjugated mode operator @xmath26 , the creation operator .",

    "therefore , @xmath90 is a square matrix .",
    "we get for the determinant @xmath91 consequently , the jacobian of the mode transformation has unity modulus  the phase - space volume is conserved , as we would expect from canonical transformations according to liouville s theorem @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics requires that the number of input modes is exactly the same as the number of output modes .",
    "modes that are `` empty '' contribute nevertheless to the quantum properties of the device .",

    "the vacuum noise behind a mirror matters @xcite , and so do the vacuum fluctuations of modes prior to amplification .    when the optical instrument transforms annihilation operators into annihilation operators without involving their hermitian conjugates , as it is the case for the one - dimensional dielectric structures analyzed in sec .  2 or for passive optical multiports in general @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath92 we see that the unitarity ( [ eq : unib ] ) of the beam - splitter matrix @xmath77 is not a coincidence  it follows from the conservation of the commutation relation ( [ eq : comm ] ) in light scattering . as a consequence of the unitarity of @xmath77 ,",
    "the total number of photons is conserved , @xmath93 passive optical instruments conserve the total energy .",
    "active devices such as phase - conjugating mirrors @xcite or parametric amplifiers @xcite combine annihilation and creation operators . consequently , the total number of photons is not conserved , in general , indicating that active devices rely on external energy sources .",
    "the linear transformation ( [ eq : linear ] ) of mode operators describes the transformation of the incident quantum light into the emerging quanta in a peculiar manner . in the mode transformations , the quantum state of light is invariant , but its relation to physical observables changes , similar to the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics .",
    "a given quantum superposition of photons , frozen in space and time , is seen first as constituting the incident modes and then as leaving in the outgoing modes .",
    "the schrdinger picture gives perhaps a more natural approach to understanding the quantum effects of optical instruments on light . here",
    "the instrument changes the state of light , whereas the mode operators remain invariant .",
    "in other words , in the schrdinger picture the incident and the emerging modes are the same and the optical instrument operates like a black box on the quantum state of light . this picture is especially suitable for analyzing laboratory situations where a few well - controlled modes enter the instrument and leave it in other equally - well - controlled modes , describing how the quantum state is transformed .",
    "the heisenberg and the schrdinger picture ought to agree on their quantum - mechanical predictions , on expectation values , and this is how we deduce the quantum - state transformations from the linear mode transformations ( [ eq : linear ] ) @xcite .    we describe the quantum state of light in terms of the density operator ( also called density matrix ) @xcite .",
    "we require for any physical observable of light , for any function of the mode operators , that the expectation values in the two pictures agree , @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the density operator of the outgoing light .",

    "the @xmath106 operator plays the role of the effective hamiltonian for the quantum - optical network @xcite , generating the linear mode transformation ( [ eq : linear ] ) in the heisenberg picture .",
    "this hamiltonian depends on the logarithm of the transformation matrix @xmath90 , which is a multivalued function with infinitely many branches .",

    "we derive the hamiltonian for the linear mode transformation ( [ eq : linear ] ) described by the beam - splitter matrix ( [ eq : rot ] ) .",

    "therefore , the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) of the beam splitter is @xmath128 the hamiltonian indicates that photons from mode 1 are annihilated and converted into photons of mode 2 , and vice versa , which is just what we expect from a beam splitter .",

    "the oldest known paradigm of geometric guidance is fermat s principle @xcite : light rays follow the shortest optical paths where the path length is measured with respect to the refractive index .    a dielectric medium acts on light , in focusing or scattering light , but , according to the principle of _ actio et reactio _ , light also acts on the medium , in exerting optical forces .",
    "we have ignored these forces here , assuming that the medium is very heavy .",
    "the light forces turn out to follow geometric ideas , too .",
    "the medium perceives the electromagnetic field as a space - time geometry as well .",
    "light and dielectric matter see each other as geometries @xcite .",
    "finally , the idea that media modify the geometry of space and time can be turned around , at least speculatively .",
    "can one interpret space - time curvature , _",
    "i.e. _  gravity , as generated by a hypothetical fluid , as an emergent phenomenon in condensed - matter physics @xcite ?",
    "sir isaac newton speculated in 1675 @xcite that gravity acts through `` an aetherial medium , much of the same constitution with air , only the vibrations far more swift and minute '' , one of sir isaac s departures to hypotheses .",
    "much later , in 1968 , andrei sakharov , father of the soviet hydrogen bomb , dissident and nobel peace price laureate , noticed @xcite that einstein s general relativity could appear as the effect of fluctuations of the quantum vacuum , the modern form of the aether .",
    "the effective metric of light in moving media @xcite does not cover all possible space - time manifolds , but the generated geometries are rich enough to include horizons .",
    "the horizon is the place where the flow speed @xmath399 exceeds the speed of light in the medium , @xmath382 . here , according to the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) , the measure of time , @xmath406 , is zero  time appears to stand still .",
    "light propagating against the current freezes .",
    "in fact , black holes have been termed `` frozen stars '' @xcite .",
    "immediately before the horizon , any outgoing light struggles to escape .",
    "the closer the distance to the horizon , the more optical cycles it takes to move forward . in turn",
    ", the wave length of light shrinks to zero at the horizon . on the other side of the horizon ,",
    "no counter - propagating light is able to escape anymore .",
    "let us turn these words into formulae .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath0 is constant .",
    "in this case the general solution of the wave equation ( [ eq : wavef ] ) is @xmath407 note that also the complex conjugate , @xmath408 , is a solution , because the wave equation ( [ eq : wavef ] ) is real .",
    "suppose , without loss of generality , that the medium flows from the right to the left such that @xmath399 is negative .",
    "hence @xmath409 describes counter - propagating and @xmath410 co - propagating wavepackets .",
    "the @xmath411 are the null coordinates in the global medium frame .",
    "( note that in more than one spatial dimension such a frame does not exist in general . )",
    "assume that the velocity @xmath399 exceeds the effective speed of light at one point , say @xmath412 , such that @xmath413 the positive constant @xmath203 describes the velocity gradient at the horizon , the analogue of the surface gravity at the event horizon of a gravitational hole .",
    "in the vicinity of the horizon we get @xmath414 with the integration constants @xmath415 . therefore ,",
    "to escape from the horizon takes an exponentially long time .",
    "assuming monochromatic light , where @xmath416 , we see that the phase @xmath122 of the light wave is logarithmic in @xmath417 .",
    "consequently , the wavelength @xmath418 is indeed proportional to the distance from the horizon , @xmath419 we also see that the @xmath420 coordinate distinguishes the left and the right side of the horizon .",
    "the constants @xmath415 must be positive on the right and negative on the left side , for not running into problems with complex time . the horizon cuts space into two disconnected parts .",
    "consider the quantum theory of light for our artificial black hole , the moving medium .",
    "as usual @xcite , the quantum field @xmath20 consists of a set of modes with the mode functions @xmath22 and the bose annihilation operators @xmath23 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : modeex ] ) . in the moving medium ,",
    "the mode functions are subject to the wave equation ( [ eq : wavef ] ) .",
    "the modes are normalized according to a scalar product that ought to stay invariant in time and that should approach the scalar product ( [ eq : scalar ] ) in the limiting case when the medium is at rest .",
    "we put @xmath421 the scalar product ( [ eq : scalarmove ] ) is the desired one , because it agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalar ] ) when @xmath399 vanishes and the product is indeed a constant in time , because of the conservation law @xmath422 after these general remarks on quantum light in moving media we return to the optical black hole .",
    "consider the monochromatic modes with frequency @xmath39 that are propagating against the current , the mode function @xmath423 on the right side of the horizon and the function @xmath424 on the left side , @xmath425 the unity step functions @xmath426 indicate that @xmath423 is only supported on the right side , whereas @xmath424 exists solely on the left side .",
    "note that the mode @xmath424 on the left side beyond the horizon oscillates with the negative frequency @xmath427 , in order to represent a proper positive - norm mode ( [ eq : orthonorm ] ) .",
    "in fact , we see from @xmath428 that the normalization integral ( [ eq : scalarmove ] ) is positive for negative @xmath429 , as is the case beyond the horizon . negative frequencies @xmath39 correspond to negative energies @xmath430 .",
    "consequently , the artificial black hole does not have a natural ground state , at least in our simplified model where the permittivity @xmath0 and the flow @xmath399 are given and fixed , ignoring the backaction of the light onto the medium .",
    "the vacuum state , the state of zero photons , traditionally the ground state , may thus depend on the history of the horizon , on the catastrophic event creating the black hole . in space , the gravitational collapse creates the black hole . in our laboratory analogue , the medium must have been accelerated in the past to form a stationary flow with a horizon . consider the quantum theory of light in the heisenberg picture where the field operators evolve and the quantum state of light remains constant . trace the mode functions back into their pre - horizon history , in order to find the decisive signature of the modes that distinguishes the initial quantum vacuum , and hence the final vacuum , too .",
    "complex analysis provides us with elegant theoretical tools for this purpose @xcite .    before the horizon has been formed , the vacuum modes stretched over the entire medium .",
    "counter - propagating waves consisted of superpositions of plane waves with positive wavenumbers , @xmath431 consider the analytic continuation of the vacuum modes to complex @xmath3 values .",
    "the @xmath432 are analytic on the upper half plane , because here @xmath433 decays for positive wavenumbers @xmath42 , such that @xmath432 can not develop singularities .",
    "now , imagine that the original modes evolve during the formation of the horizon where the medium is gently accelerated to exceed the effective speed of light beyond one point .",
    "a smooth process can not fundamentally alter the analytic properties of waves .",
    "consequently , we can employ the analyticity of the mode functions as a marker to distinguish the vacuum state of light .",
    "the modes @xmath423 and @xmath424 are clearly non - analytic , because they lack support on either one of the horizon sides .",
    "yet we can glue @xmath423 and @xmath434 together to form analytic wave functions @xcite .",
    "close to the horizon , we have @xmath435 circumventing the horizon on the upper half plane , we use the property @xmath436 , and find the combinations @xmath437 that are analytic on the upper half plane when @xmath438 the vacuum modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are normalized according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : orthonorm ] ) with the scalar product ( [ eq : scalarmove ] ) , taking into account that both @xmath423 and @xmath424 are normalized and orthogonal , and that the norm of @xmath408 is the negative norm of @xmath7 . the mode transformations ( [ eq : bogo ] ) imply that @xmath439 the black hole acts as a parametric amplifier , transforming the incident vacuum into the two - mode squeezed vacuum state ( [ eq : tmsv ] ) , the entangled einstein - podolsky - rosen state @xcite .",
    "the steeper the velocity gradient @xmath203 the stronger is the entanglement and hence the energy of the two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "the horizon generates photon pairs , both propagating against the current , but one escaping on the right side of the horizon and the other drifting to the left .",
    "somehow the flow must provide the energy for the photon production that , in turn , will cause friction . in space",
    "@xcite , the gravitational field surrounding the black hole , created by the mass of the collapsed object , should provide the energy for the emerging hawking radiation .",
    "the black hole is evaporating and is getting smaller .",
    "all black holes are similar , apart from their scales @xcite .",
    "therefore , smaller holes generate larger gradients of the gravitational potential .",
    "consequently @xcite , the evaporation is accelerating , until the black hole explodes in a grand fiery finale .    if we confine ourselves to the right side of the horizon , our natural place in the case of gravitational black holes , we perceive the two - mode squeezed vacuum ( [ eq : tmsv ] ) as the thermal state ( [ eq : thermal ] ) with the temperature ( [ eq : tzeta ] ) , the hawking temperature @xmath440 the temperature depends only on the velocity gradient @xmath203 , the analogue of the surface gravity of the hole .",
    "consequently , the hawking temperature ( [ eq : hawking ] ) is the same for the entire spectrum , which is highly non - trivial .",
    "the black hole appears as a black - body radiator in thermal equilibrium @xcite , a mysterious result @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the black hole acts as an active optical instruments , as a parametric amplifier .",
    "so far , we have ignored the passive optical properties of the hole , the analogue of the gravitational lens @xcite . here",
    "we sketch how these properties are taken into account , _",
    "i.e. _ , how to include the light scattering of the optical black hole . in our simple one - dimensional example , scattering occurs only when the permittivity @xmath0 of the medium varies in space , because the solution ( [ eq : axt ] ) for constant @xmath0 maintains co- and counter - propagating light as the separate waves @xmath409 and @xmath410 .",
    "when @xmath0 varies , we represent the monochromatic modes on the two sides of the horizon as @xmath441 where the @xmath442 , @xmath443 and @xmath46 are slowly varying functions of @xmath3 .",
    "similar to sec .",
    "2.3 , we construct the transfer matrix ( [ eq : connex ] ) in order to connect @xmath442 and @xmath46 between the various points on the right side of the horizon .",
    "also in the case of moving media , the transfer matrix exhibits the structure ( [ eq : trans ] ) with the determinant ( [ eq : det ] ) .",
    "the latter property is a consequence of the conservation law ( [ eq : consmove ] ) that implies for monochromatic modes @xmath444 substituting the structure ( [ eq : astructure ] ) with the transfer - matrix connection ( [ eq : connex ] ) gives the differential equation for the determinant ( [ eq : det ] ) .",
    "similar to sec .",
    "2.4 , we use the transfer matrix to define the in and out modes , but starting here with the outgoing modes , @xmath445 where @xmath446 describes an outgoing counter - propagating wave , whereas @xmath447 refers to a co - propagating wave .",
    "the @xmath446 wave originates at the horizon , propagating to the right , whereas @xmath447 propagates to the left at @xmath448 and crosses the horizon without anything unusual happening .",
    "we assume that at @xmath448 the effective speed of light , @xmath382 and the flow @xmath399 approach constants such that light approaches plane waves with the wavenumbers @xmath449 in this case @xmath450 obeys the asymptotics @xmath451 and @xmath452 satisfies the corresponding asymptotics similar to the complex conjugate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : as1 ] ) . on the other side of the horizon",
    ", we define an outgoing counter - propagating wave by @xmath453 we find that @xmath447 is orthogonal to @xmath446 with respect to the scalar product ( [ eq : scalarmove ] ) on the right side of the horizon .",
    "furthermore , @xmath447 is automatically orthogonal to @xmath454 on the left side , because here the two waves oscillate at opposite frequencies .",
    "consequently , the @xmath446 , @xmath447 , @xmath454 establish a set suitable for the mode expansion ( [ eq : modeex ] ) of quantum light , the set of the outgoing modes .",
    "the ingoing modes are the two analytic vacuum modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bogo ] ) , and a mode @xmath455 that is connected to @xmath446 and @xmath447 by the scattering matrix @xmath77 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mediab ] ) on the right side of the horizon .",
    "we thus arrive at the transformations @xmath456 consequently , the performance of the black hole as a passive optical instrument is entirely due to the light scattering on the right side of the horizon .",
    "the scattering matrix describes the fraction ( [ eq : mediab ] ) of the generated hawking radiation that reaches the detector at @xmath457 .",
    "the rest of the generated light is scattered into co - propagating waves across the horizon and lost .",
    "the black - body radiation of the hole is thus moderated by the grey - body factor @xmath458 .",
    "we have gone a long way from studying a piece of glass to the quantum physics of black holes .",
    "objects as diverse as beam splitters , multiports , interferometers , fibre couplers , polarizers , gravitational lenses , parametric amplifiers , phase - conjugating mirrors and black holes have something in common  they act on light as simple optical instruments , _ i.e._as linear optical networks .",
    "a linear optical network turns a set of incident light modes into an equal number of outgoing modes by a linear transformation .",
    "if the transformation does not mix annihilation and creation operators the instrument is passive and it does conserve the total number of photons .",
    "otherwise , the instrument is active and requires an energy source ( or drain ) .",
    "such optical networks are reversible devices where , in principle , all the outgoing modes can be reversed to restore the incident modes . however , we can also model irreversible devices such as absorbers or amplifiers by fictitious beam splitters or parametric amplifiers , respectively , where we keep track of only one of the outgoing modes .",
    "the quantum noise of the unobserved modes accounts for the absorption or amplification noise and the mode itself represents the absorption or amplification reservoir .",
    "our starting point has been the quantum optics of a dielectric slab , say a piece of glass .",
    "this simple example indicates how to develop a quantum theory of light in dielectric media and it shows how the mode transformations of passive optical instruments come about .",
    "we have developed the theoretical tools to analyze the quantum physics of linear optical networks and we have applied them to a few characteristic situations , to the splitting and interference of photons and to the manifestation of quantum correlations in parametric downconversion .",
    "we have sketched how to describe irreversible processes in quantum mechanics and how to apply this theory to determine effective models for absorbers and amplifiers . finally , we returned to the starting point , revisiting the quantum optics in dielectrics .",
    "we showed that the creation of a horizon turns a passive medium into an active device , similar to the quantum black hole .",

    "<S> simple optical instruments are linear optical networks where the incident light modes are turned into equal numbers of outgoing modes by linear transformations . for example , such instruments are beam splitters , multiports , interferometers , fibre couplers , polarizers , gravitational lenses , parametric amplifiers , phase - conjugating mirrors and also black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the article develops the quantum theory of simple optical instruments and applies the theory to a few characteristic situations , to the splitting and interference of photons and to the manifestation of einstein - podolsky - rosen correlations in parametric downconversion . how to model irreversible devices such as absorbers and amplifiers is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the article develops the theory of hawking radiation for a simple optical black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is intended as a primer , as a nearly self - consistent tutorial . </S>",
    "<S> the reader should be familiar with basic quantum mechanics and statistics , and perhaps with optics and some elementary field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum theory of light in dielectrics serves as the starting point and , in the concluding section , as a guide to understand quantum black holes . </S>"
