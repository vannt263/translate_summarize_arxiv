    "excitons in semiconductors are a simple and very convenient analog of an atomic system . like atoms , excitons can form molecules ( biexcitons @xcite ) and ions ( trions @xcite ) .",
    "the rydberg energy and bohr radius of excitons are @xmath0  mev and @xmath1  nm as compared to @xmath0  ev and @xmath2  nm for atoms .",
    "this makes excitons more susceptible to external fields and allows one to implement in the laboratory conditions that are achievable only at extreme places of the universe for atoms .",
    "examples include the stabilization of the electron - hole liquid by a magnetic field @xcite and spatial separation of electrons and holes by an electric field in quantum wells ( qws ) , which makes excitons indirect , suppressing the formation of exciton complexes and enhancing exciton radiative lifetime @xcite .",
    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a system of ultracold atoms two decades ago @xcite together with rapid progress in nanotechnology inspired the work which has led to the attainment of bec in a system of spatially indirect excitons in qws @xcite and exciton polaritons in microcavities @xcite .",
    "atomic bec was achieved at temperatures of @xmath3  k , which comprises the main difficulty in the experiment . on the other hand",
    ", the bec of excitons can be reached at temperatures of @xmath4  k due to their much smaller effective mass compared to the atomic mass .",
    "excitons inevitably interact with thermal reservoir , the lattice , through the emission and absorption of phonons , and exciton system cooling is accomplished via the lattice cooling . on the other hand ,",
    "an atomic system can be left on its own in a magneto - optical trap without interaction with any thermal reservoir , and the temperature of such a system is decreased by laser and evaporative cooling techniques @xcite . similarly to atomic bec , the achievement of exciton bec suffers from inelastic exciton - exciton collisions leading to biexciton formation @xcite and even to collapse into electron - hole liquid @xcite .",
    "the exciton system in direct gap semiconductors suffers also from radiative recombination .",
    "this is why exciton bec was searched for indirect excitons with suppressed recombination and coulomb attraction .",
    "so far , it was believed that the main effect of exciton radiative recombination and biexciton formation on bec is the decrease of exciton population which can be faster than thermalization of the system with the lattice @xcite . in this case",
    ", it would be possible to attain bec for resonant excitation of cold gas of direct excitons within an exciton population lifetime which is @xmath5  ns in gaas qws .",
    "this lifetime and even exciton recombination time @xcite are longer than exciton thermalization time @xcite .",
    "however , so far , only coherence mediated by the exciting laser was observed for exciton gas at low densities @xcite , and no signatures of spontaneous coherence were reported for direct excitons , to the best of our knowledge . in this paper , we show that exciton and biexciton recombination leads to significant heating of the exciton system .",
    "this imposes a new restriction on the possibility of exciton bec .",
    "in particular , recombination heating makes it impossible to achieve bec in a system of direct excitons in gaas qws even for resonantly excited cold exciton gas .",
    "first , we determine the exciton and biexciton recombination times in qws . in previous studies , the exciton recombination time ( radiative decay time of low - momenta radiative excitons )",
    "was extracted from the photoluminescence ( pl ) kinetics of resonantly created excitons using sophisticated models taking into account different scattering mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the exciton recombination time was also determined in four - wave mixing experiments @xcite and calculated theoretically @xcite . here , by using exciton - resonant excitation with different polarizations and powers and also different temperatures ,",
    "we clearly show contributions of different dephasing processes to the decay rate of the fast component in the pl kinetics and determine the exciton recombination time .",
    "the biexciton recombination time so far was determined only in four - wave mixing experiments @xcite and calculated theoretically @xcite . in this study , we determine biexciton recombination time directly by observing the decay of biexciton pl and rise of exciton pl upon the resonant excitation of biexcitons .",
    "heating by exciton recombination ( evaporative optical heating ) was considered previously theoretically for free carriers @xcite and indirect excitons @xcite in qws",
    ". however , to study this effect experimentally , one has to measure fairly small temperature changes . here , we develop and ground a sensitive method to determine the exciton temperature dynamics based on the temperature dependence of the exciton population decay rate .",
    "we show both theoretically and experimentally that , for the considered system of direct excitons , the exciton temperature is higher than the lattice temperature by @xmath6  k due to exciton recombination heating .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the formation of biexcitons followed by their recombination also contributes significantly to the heating of the system . with increasing excitation power , the temperature increases by an amount proportional to the ratio of the biexciton and exciton concentrations , and this amount becomes as high as @xmath0  k.",

    "is significantly reduced with respect to the exciton line as the e - h density decays with time ( fig .",
    "[ spectra](a ) ) .",
    "we attribute this low - energy line to biexciton emission",

    "the spectrum is fitted with two lorentzian peaks ( lines in fig .",
    "[ spectra](a ) ) to determine the intensities , widths , and spectral positions of the exciton and biexciton lines .",
    "the intensity of the biex line decays about two times faster than the intensity of the ex line ( fig .",
    "[ spectra](b ) ) as expected for biexcitons @xcite , and the biexciton nature of the biex line will be further confirmed throughout the paper .",
    "here we determine the exciton recombination time ( radiative decay time of low - momenta radiative excitons ) by investigating the exciton dynamics with temporal resolution of about 5  ps for exciton - resonant linearly polarized excitation .",
    "figure  [ exdec](a ) shows exciton intensity dynamics registered in polarization parallel ( @xmath18 , solid curves ) and perpendicular ( @xmath19 , dashed curves ) to the excitation polarization .",
    "two decay components are clearly seen in the @xmath18 polarization kinetics , while the @xmath19 polarization kinetics shows the slow component only .",
    "we interpret these observations as follows .",
    "a resonant excitation pulse creates a large population of low-@xmath20 radiative excitons with wave vectors within the light - cone .",
    "accordingly , the fast component is induced by the initial low-@xmath20 exciton recombination and scattering towards the nonradiative reservoir , while the slow component corresponds to the decay of the reservoir exciton population .",
    "the contribution of a spin relaxation to the decay of the fast component is small @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the pl decay in @xmath18 polarization would be accompanied by the comparable pl rise in the @xmath19 polarization , which is not seen in the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ exdec](a ) ) . the initial scattering of the low-@xmath20 excitons to the nonradiative states corresponds to the increase of the mean exciton energy ( temperature ) either due to the absorption of phonons ( the corresponding scattering rate is @xmath21 ) or to the formation of biexcitons ( the corresponding rate is @xmath22 ) .",
    "indeed , each biexciton formation event releases energy for the exciton system approximately equal to the biexciton binding energy . for the decay rate of the fast component neglecting the scattering back from the reservoir we can write @xmath23 . as the excitation density @xmath24",
    "is increased , the rate of biexciton formation increases and @xmath25 should decrease , which we do observe in the experiment ( black squares in fig .",
    "[ exdec](b ) ) . in the limit of @xmath26",
    "we have @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , for circularly polarized excitation , the fast component decay time for the co - polarized intensity is almost independent of @xmath24 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that biexciton formation is suppressed for circularly polarized exciton population since total biexciton spin equals zero @xcite .",
    "an increase in the lattice temperature @xmath28 should favor phonon absorption and lead to an increase in @xmath21 , causing a decrease in @xmath25",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ exdec](c ) shows that @xmath25 is almost independent of @xmath28 , indicating that @xmath29 . as we show in the following , interaction with phonons",
    "is characterized by times of @xmath30  ps .",
    "note also that at low @xmath24 secondary emission can preserve laser - mediated coherence for a time comparable to @xmath31 @xcite , which , of course , does not prevent exciton radiative decay at the rate @xmath32 .",
    "finally , at small @xmath24 , @xmath33 and we get the exciton recombination time @xmath34  ps .",

    "@xmath15 k. ]    [ secbiex ]    now we determine the biexciton recombination time ( radiative lifetime ) by investigating the exciton - biexciton dynamics with a temporal resolution of about 5  ps for biexciton - resonant linearly polarized excitation ( fig .",
    "[ biexdec ] ) .",
    "biexciton - resonant excitation implies the absorption of two photons leading to the creation of a biexciton having an energy of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we used the excitation photon energy @xmath37 detuned by @xmath38  mev from the exciton resonance .",
    "figure  [ biexdec ] shows , that for this excitation energy , the biexciton intensity greatly exceeds the exciton intensity at short times .",
    "then , the biexciton intensity rapidly decays with a characteristic time @xmath39  ps . the decay of the biexciton intensity is accompanied by an increase in the exciton intensity , which starts to decrease at later times .    the simplest scenario explaining the experimental observations is the following . an excitation pulse creates biexciton population .",
    "in a process of biexciton radiative decay , one of the e - h pairs constituting a biexciton recombines to give a photon with energy @xmath40 and leaves an exciton .",
    "thus , the radiative decay of biexciton population is accompanied by the creation of the same amount of excitons . subsequently excitons",
    "either decay radiatively or form secondary biexcitons giving much weaker emission at longer times , so the latter process can be neglected . according to this scenario",
    "the time - integrated biexciton intensity should be equal to the time - integrated exciton intensity .",
    "in the experiment , however , the total exciton intensity exceeds the total biexciton intensity by a about factor of @xmath41 for all considered excitation powers ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ biexdec ] , solid squares and circles , respectively ) .",
    "this fact indicates that excitons can be formed not only as a result of biexciton radiative decay , but also as a result of biexciton dissociation .",
    "furthermore , the excitation pulse can create some initial exciton population which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ biexdec ] as a nonzero value of the exciton intensity corresponding to the maximal biexciton intensity .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ biexdec ] demonstrates that both exciton and biexciton time - integrated intensities show almost identical power dependences , which at low @xmath24 can be approximated by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , with the exponent about twice as large as that for the excitons upon exciton - resonant excitation ( @xmath44 , open squares in the inset , the sublinear dependence might be related to the fact that we do not register the emission in the direction of the direct reflection of the resonant beam which shows a large secondary emission intensity within a few picoseconds @xcite ) .",
    "these @xmath24-dependences confirm the fact that biexcitons are created by two - photon absorption process .",
    "furthermore , the possible initial exciton population is also created by two - photon rather than by the standard one - photon absorption process .",
    "however , more likely all the excitons are created from decay or dissociation of biexcitons only , and the initial exciton population reflects the number of excitons created from biexcitons within our time resolution .",
    "the dynamics of the exciton - biexciton system can be described by the following rate equations @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the exciton and biexciton concentrations , respectively ; @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the times of the whole exciton population radiative decay , biexciton recombination , and biexciton dissociation , respectively ; the term @xmath51 describes biexciton formation from two excitons . in the description of the fast stage we disregard the formation of secondary biexcitons described by the last term in both equations .",
    "this process determines the biexciton intensity when quasiequilibrium between exciton and biexciton populations is established .",
    "this intensity is much smaller than the biexciton intensity at the considered fast stage for the same level of the exciton intensity ( compare figs .",

    "however , @xmath70 and @xmath49 have different physical meanings .",
    "the exciton recombination time determines the rate of radiative decay of only low-@xmath20 radiative excitons , while the total exciton population , mainly consisting of nonradiative reservoir , decays at longer times @xmath71  ps , as it follows from the experiment ( fig .",

    "biexciton radiative decay is allowed for any biexciton wave vector since it can be transmitted to the residual exciton .",

    "@xcite , where @xmath49 was calculated for all biexciton momenta . on the other hand , calculations performed for biexcitons with almost zero momentum within the giant oscillator strength model @xcite as well as four - wave mixing experiments , which also probe almost zero - momentum biexcitons , @xcite give somewhat smaller biexciton recombination times : 20 and 11  ps , respectively .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath67  ps is much smaller than the biexciton recombination time evaluated in ref .",

    "this assumption is not valid .",
    "now , let us consider the behavior on the time scale @xmath74 .",
    "one can easily estimate that , contrary to the common belief @xcite , the biexciton population is much smaller than the exciton one even for comparable exciton and biexciton intensities @xmath75 : @xmath76 .",

    "the biexciton population is driven by the excitons just like the nonequilibrium polariton population in a microcavity is driven by the exciton reservoir @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the absolute value of the exciton density @xmath46 .",
    "poor knowledge of the qw absorption coefficient makes it difficult to determine @xmath46 directly from the excitation density . for our estimates",

    ", the temperature dynamics is described by the equation @xmath158 leading to @xmath159 the last term determines the temperature increase due to biexciton recombination . to calculate this term ,",
    "one should obtain the time dependence of @xmath46 and @xmath47 from eqs .",
    "( [ biexformx ] ) and ( [ biexformb ] ) .",
    "however , the constants @xmath48 , @xmath50 and formation rate @xmath51 in these equations in turn depend on @xmath101 . to get an approximate expression for the last term in eq .",
    ", we put @xmath160 and @xmath161 and disregard the dependence of @xmath48 on @xmath101 .",
    "finally , @xmath162 thus , biexciton recombination can increase the internal temperature by as much as @xmath163 .    ) with different powers .",
    "lines in fig .",
    "[ figtdynbiex](b ) show biexponential fits .",
    "@xmath15 k. ]    figure  [ figtdynbiex](b ) shows the exciton temperature dynamics for different powers of exciton - resonant excitation .",
    "the corresponding exciton and biexciton intensities are shown in fig .",
    "[ figtdynbiex](a ) . for the lowest excitation power",
    ", the temperature monotonously increases to the steady - state value @xmath164 . on the other hand , for higher powers , when the biexciton intensity becomes comparable to the exciton intensity ( fig .",
    "[ figtdynbiex](a ) ) , the temperature first increases above @xmath164 and then decreases to @xmath164 .",
    "this initial temperature rise results from biexciton recombination heating and is proportional to @xmath165 .",
    "as the biexciton intensity becomes much lower than the exciton intensity , the temperature relaxes to @xmath164 .",
    "the dependences in fig .",
    "[ figtdynbiex](b ) are fitted with double - exponential functions in accordance with eq .   with the temperature decay time",
    "set to @xmath166  ns .",
    "the described heating mechanisms cancel out the possibility of exciton bec in the considered system even for resonant excitation .",
    "indeed , the system temperature can not be lower than @xmath167  k for a time longer than few tens of picoseconds even for @xmath168 .",
    "this already gives a bec threshold density of at least @xmath169  @xmath88 which is of the same level as the exciton saturation density @xmath170  @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , an increase in the exciton density leads to a proportional increase in the temperature due to biexciton recombination heating @xmath171 .",
    "experiment shows that even a moderate increase in @xmath46 , to the level when @xmath172 becomes comparable to @xmath173 , leads to an increase in @xmath101 up to @xmath0  k. this effect forbids exciton bec even if one forgets about exciton saturation .",
    "a consistent picture of exciton and biexciton recombination in gaas / algaas quantum wells has been developed .",
    "the exciton recombination time has been determined to be @xmath69  ps , while the radiative decay time of the whole exciton population including large - momentum nonradiative part is @xmath174 k / ns@xmath175 .",
    "the biexciton recombination time , which also characterizes the radiative decay of the whole biexciton population , has been determined to be @xmath176  ps . as a result of @xmath177 ,",
    "the biexciton concentration is significantly lower than one would expect in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is also much lower than the exciton concentration , while the exciton and biexciton emission intensities can be comparable .",
    "thus , the main role of the biexciton states in the thermodynamics of the whole system is that they provide an additional radiative channel for excitons .",
    "a method of determining the temperature dynamics of the exciton system has been developed .",
    "it is based on the proportionality of the radiative decay time of the whole exciton population and temperature of the exciton system and also takes into account biexciton recombination channel .",
    "the method has been tested in experiments with different excess energies of the excitation photons which define the initial temperatures of the system .",
    "the heating of the exciton system by exciton recombination has been analyzed theoretically and revealed in the experiment .",
    "this effect is analogous to evaporative cooling in atomic systems .",
    "an increase in the temperature due to recombination heating ( @xmath167  k in the qws under study ) is proportional to the exciton recombination rate and inversely proportional to the rate of cooling by acoustic phonons .    if has been shown that biexciton formation and subsequent recombination also lead to an increase in the exciton temperature by an amount proportional to the ratio of the biexciton and exciton emission intensities . for comparable biexciton and exciton intensities",
    ", this increase can be as large as tens of kelvins .",
    "the revealed recombination heating effects imply new restrictions on the bose - einstein condensation of excitons .",
    "these restrictions cancel out bec in many exciton systems even where the thermalization rate exceeds the radiative decay rate ( like direct excitons in gaas / algaas qws ) and even for resonantly created cold exciton gas .",
