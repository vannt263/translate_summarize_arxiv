    "the distance has normally been assumed to be @xmath3 , as derived by the parallax of 0.034  ( jenkins @xcite , vogt 1981 ) , however the new _ hipparcos _ satellite measurements give a value of @xmath4pc ( @xmath5mas ) .",

    "@xcite ) . in the x - rays ,",
    "three strong flares have been observed with exosat , ginga and asca , with an energy release of @xmath8 in the first two cases .",
    "the flare seen by exosat in the 0.05 - 7kev energy band lasted longer than a day , with a rise time of @xmath9 hours , a peak phase of at least 2 hours and a long decay unfortunately not continuously observed by exosat because of perigee passages .",
    "the quiescent value was reached again only two days after the occurrence of the peak of the flare ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "the intense ginga flare has been only partially observed during the decay phase , however it was still so intense to be detected up to 18kev , with a power - law tail at energies greater than 10kev ( doyle et al .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , the asca flare lasted for about 18 hours , with an enhancement of a factor of @xmath10 in the iron abundance during the rise phase of the flare ( mewe et al .",
    "@xcite ) and a total energy of @xmath11erg .",
    "quiescent x - ray emission from has also been observed by the rosat pspc during the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , dempsey et al . @xcite and @xcite ) and as a pointed target ( huenemoerder & baluta @xcite ) .",
    "the rass observation showed a luminosity of @xmath12ergs@xmath13 with a bimodal temperature distribution with a high and a low temperature component of @xmath14 and @xmath15mk , respectively .",
    "the emission measure ratio , @xmath16 was @xmath17 and no interstellar absorption was constrained by the data ( dempsey et al .",
    "the pointed observation lasted 60ksec for an eventual 18ksec effective observing time .",

    "eventually , the best  fit coronal metal abundance turned out to be 0.3 - 0.4 @xmath24solar .    since both the exosat and ginga flares were observed during the minima of the photometric wave , and a large number of uv and optical flares",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect.[sec : data ] we describe the data sample and the analysis technique applied . in sect.[sec : results ] the results are presented , and they are finally discussed in sect.[sec : discussion ] .",
    "the _ beppo_sax satellite carries aboard a number of x - ray detectors able to cover a wide energy range , from 0.1 to 300kev ( boella et al .",
    "actually , apart from some very intense x - ray flares , the study of coronal sources can only be performed with the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs , parmar et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the two medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs , boella et al .",
    "still these instruments are sensitive to a large energy range .",
    "in particular the lecs covers the range from 0.1 to 10 kev , with a spectral resolution comparable at the lowest energies to that of ccd detectors ( such as those used on asca ) .",
    "favata et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have argued on the basis of spectral simulations of asca and _ beppo_sax lecs spectra that the broader spectral band of the latter instrument should allow a better determination of the overall coronal metallicity , even if the lower resolution at higher energies makes it difficult to determine the individual metal abundances .",
    "the mecs detectors cover only the 1.710kev energy range but they have an effective area about two times larger than that of the lecs , allowing the study of the fek complex at @xmath26kev more effectively .    _",
    "beppo_sax observed from december 5 to 6 1997 for about 19 hours ( observation sequential number 10161001 ) , yielding @xmath27ks and @xmath28ks of effective observing time in the lecs and mecs detectors , respectively .",
    "the difference in exposure time is due to the fact that the lecs can only operate when in the earth shadow .",
    "the data analysis has been based on the linearized , cleaned , event files , obtained by the _ beppo_sax science data center ( sdc ; giommi & fiore @xcite ) on - line archive .",
    "the light curves and spectra were extracted using the ftools ( v. 4.0 ) package , with an extraction region of 8.5 and 4  radius for the lecs and the mecs , respectively .",
    "the different regions are due to a broader point spread function ( psf ) for the lecs at low energies , while above 2kev the lecs and mecs psfs are essentially comparable .",
    "the considered extraction regions contain more than 90% of the counts for all energies .",
    "the light curve analysis has been performed with the xronos ( v.4.02 ) package , while for the spectral analysis we used the xspec ( v.10.0 ) package , with the response matrices released by the sdc in september 1997 .",
    "the spectra were rebinned following the recipe provided by the sdc .",
    "the rebinning samples the instrumental resolution with the same number of channels , three in our case , at all energies .",
    "lecs and mecs background spectra were accumulated from blank fields available at the public sdc ftp site ( see fiore et al .",
    "@xcite ; parmar et al .",
    "lecs data have been analyzed only in the 0.14kev range due to still unsolved calibration problems at higher energies ( fiore et al .",
    "the lecs and mecs spectra were always conjunctly fit after having allowed a rescaling factor for lecs data in order to take into account the uncertainties in the inter - calibration of the detectors .",
    "the rescaling factor turned out to be @xmath29 , which is within the acceptable range of @xmath30 ( fiore et al .",

    "as mentioned above , interesting spectral information could also be obtained in some cases from the phoswich detector system ( frontera et al .",
    "@xcite ) aboard _ beppo_sax , even if this detector had been designed to provide the best sensitivity at energies relatively higher than those typical for a stellar corona .",
    "the energy range covered by the pds is from 15 to 300kev .",
    "hard x - ray emissions ( @xmath31kev ) have been detected during strong flares from active stars ( pallavicini et al .",
    "@xcite ) . during the present observation ,",
    "however , no convincing evidence of a pds detection has been found .",
    "this is not surprising since coronal sources have been detected with the pds only during the rise and the peak phase of strong x - ray flares , and not during the decay phase ( which was the only one observed for ) .",
    "the optical observations were performed in the standard bv filters , using the marcon 50-cm telescope of the brera astronomical observatory at merate ( italy ) , equipped with a photon - counting photometer ( emi9789qa ) .",
    "( ) and ( ) were used as comparison stars .",
    "in fig.[fig : lc ] we show the total mecs light curve and the 2.0 - 10.0kev / 0.1 - 1.5kev ( mecs / lecs ) hardness ratio .",
    "the best fit exponential plus constant fit of the mecs light curve is also shown . the quiescent value determined at the end of",
    "the observation turns out to be @xmath32ctss@xmath13 while the flare decay time is @xmath33hours .",
    "the background amounts only to roughly one hundredth of the source flux and has been stable for the whole observation .",
    "variability is clearly present , the flux in the @xmath34kev band decreases by a factor @xmath35 in about 10 hours .",
    "this behavior would suggest that we are observing the tail of a long - lasting flare .",
    "unfortunately , the optical observations do not help in this respect since during the _",
    "beppo_sax observation bad weather at merate prevented us to perform any photometry .",
    "observations could only be performed on the next night ( december 6 - 7 ) when the source did not show any sign of activity .",
    "no variability larger than the observational uncertainties was detected ; the standard deviations of the differential measurements - ( @xmath36mag in both colors ) are similar to those measured between the comparison stars .",

    "no significant differences have been found in the results obtained with the two models and therefore we report here only the mekal results .",

    "the @xmath40 minimization statistics was applied throughout the paper .",
    "abundance variations in the source spectrum have been modeled through the use of a single parameter , the global `` metallicity '' @xmath41 , by assuming a fixed ratio between individual elemental abundances and the corresponding solar photospheric values as given by anders & grevesse ( @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite ; mewe et al .",
    "@xcite ) where the derived interstellar reddening amounted to @xmath44 @xmath23 . indeed ,",
    "applying the relation @xmath45 ( paresce @xcite ) a value of @xmath46 is obtained , rather close to the value obtained by the analyses of rosat , exosat and euve data and still an order of magnitude lower than the result obtained by the fit of _",
    "beppo_sax data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     satisfactory fits to the data were not possible with single  temperature models .",
    "two  temperature models with @xmath42 fixed to @xmath47 @xmath23 were also not able to provide satisfactory fits to the data and strong residuals are clearly visible below 0.4kev ( fig.[fig : totnhfix ] ) . to check",
    "if this result could be related to the source variability the observation was subdivided in two distinct parts ( fig.[fig : lc ] ) , and lecs and mecs spectra were accumulated for the first and second part separately . however , even in these two cases we did not obtain any satisfactory fits with this @xmath42 value ( table[tab : spec1 ] ) and the results for the two time intervals were essentially indistinguishable .",
    "c    in all three cases significant improvement to the fits are obtained by two  temperature models with @xmath42 and the metal abundance free to vary . in these cases",
    "the metal abundance value is lower and more similar to the value found from the rosat ( huenemoerder & baluta @xcite ) , asca and euve data ( mewe et al . 1997 ) .",
    "fit models are shown in figures[fig : totnhfix ] and [ fig : totnhfree ] and refer to two  temperature mekal models for the whole data set with @xmath42 either frozen to @xmath48 @xmath23 or free to vary .",
    "consequently , our _ beppo_sax data can be only fitted assuming a large @xmath42 .",

    "this anomaly may be due either to a problem in the calibration of the lecs detector below 0.5kev ( i.e. where @xmath42 is estimated in case of values lower than @xmath49 @xmath23 ) or to an incorrect source modeling evidenced by the wide _",
    "beppo_sax energy range .",
    "c    two - temperature fits performed removing the energy channels below 0.4kev show that any interstellar absorption ( up to few @xmath50@xmath23 ) is adequate to fit the data ( i.e. @xmath42 is no more constrained ) .",
    "the fits are always statistically acceptable ( @xmath51 ) and the metal abundance remains unchanged ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "on the contrary , the data can not be fitted with solar abundance even with the addition of a third temperature component .",
    "this is also true if we use the photosperic abundance ( @xmath53 ) derived by ottmann et al .",

    "1997 ) using euve and asca data determined the differential emission measure ( dem ) distribution of this source .",
    "they found a bimodal distribution for the data of both satellites , with the two peaks centered at @xmath54 and @xmath55 mk for the asca data . in both cases the dem analysis gave results fully consistent with the one obtained using a two  temperature fit .",
    "our _ beppo_sax results are similar to the asca ones , we essentially find the same two temperatures ( see table[tab : spec2 ] ) , but the asca softer em is larger than the harder one , while our harder em is a factor of two larger than the softer one",
    ". this could be due to the decay phase of the flare , that we seem to have detected .",
    "however , our results are also essentially in agreement with those derived by the rosat data analysis of huenemoerder & baluta ( @xcite ) once we take into account the small rosat energy band - width . in that case",
    "the rosat light curve only shows a steady linear decline from the beginning of the observation of @xmath56 without significant evidence of flare activity .",

    "( @xcite ) is correct , we have a discrepancy by a factor @xmath9 between the photospheric and the coronal metallicities , similarly to what has been reported for other active stars ( e.g. , mewe et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to explain the observed metallicity gradient two possible mechanisms",
    "are often invoked : the so called first ionization potential ( fip ) effect and the hydrostatic equilibrium stratification .",
    "the fip - effect has been invoked to explain the observed abundance gradient in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the elements with a high fip ( n , o , ne , ar ) are underabundant in the corona , with respect h , by a factor of 3 - 4 compared to the photosphere . on the contrary , elements with a low fip ( fe , mg , si , ca , na ) are overabundant ( meyer @xcite , feldman & widing @xcite ) . in case",
    "the fip - effect is effectively working in , we should expect that overall metallicity @xmath41 ( which is essentially determined by fe ) is enhanced ( and not depleted , as observed ) with respect to the photospheric value .",
    "moreover , elements such as fe , mg and si , which have the same fip ( @xmath64ev ) , should have approximately the same ratio between their coronal and photospheric abundances .",
    "our _ beppo_sax data do have not enough resolution to constrain the abundances of individual elements , but the coronal abundances derived from the asca and euve observations by mewe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) do not appear to confirm this expectation in the case of .",
    "in fact , whereas fe , mg and si have similar photospheric abundances ( ottmann et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the fe and si coronal abundances reported by mewe et al . ( @xcite ) differ by a factor of 2 . if the coronal abundances derived by us and others from x - ray observations are correct , and do not depend significantly on uncertainties on the atomic data and on the modeling ( including neglected possible line opacity effects , cf . schrijver et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and if the photospheric abundances derived by ottmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) are also correct , there is a clear discrepancy in between photospheric and coronal abundances .",
    "however , the fip - effect is unlikely to be the cause for this discrepancy .",
    "the second scenario , proposed by mewe et al .",
    "( @xcite , see also van den oord & mewe , @xcite ) , and widely discussed by ottmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , consists of the possibility that a reduction in the metal coronal abundance is simply the effect of the establishment of hydrostatic equilibrium . the scale height for each ion depends on the mass and charge and the depletion of the coronal abundances compared to the the photospheric ones may even reach a factor within @xmath34 .",
    "the whole problem seems rather complex and is still lacking of a full and satisfactory theoretical treatment",
    ". however , ottmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , neglecting the effect of the ion charge , conclude that for an agreement between observations and predictions for fe , mg and si can be found in the sense that the correct direction of the effect is predicted .",
    "an interesting alternative and/or complementary explanation for these observations has been proposed recently by drake ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism consists in the possibility that the depletion of the coronal abundances is only apparent and actually due to the enhancement of the coronal he abundance .",
    "the gross result would be that of a lowering of the ratio between lines and continuum , just what is actually measured to derive the metal abundance from x - ray observations of stellar coronae . in stellar coronae with temperature @xmath65k , in fact",
    ", the continuum emission is driven by inelastic collisions between electrons and h and he nuclei .",
    "he in coronae can be more abundant than in the photosphere due to a fractioning of the composition analogous at the fip - effect ( see , for instance , meyer @xcite ) .",
    "there is , moreover , the possibility that he nuclei are braked due to an inefficient coulombian drag in the wind acceleration phase ( see geiss @xcite ) . to mimic the metal abundances we derived in this paper ( @xmath66 , or [ fe / h]@xmath67 )",
    "would be necessary to assume that the ratio between the he and the h coronal abundance for is more than a factor of ten higher than that in the sun ( see fig.1 in drake @xcite , i.e. an he abundance comparable to or higher than that of the h ) .",
    "we tried to fit the x - ray spectra assuming a coronal metal abundance equal to the photospheric one determined by ottmann et al . ( @xcite ) and letting the he abundance free to vary .",
    "however , we could not find a good fit to the data in this way .",
    "thus , this does not seem to be a valid explanation for the case .",
    "the energy released by the flare we detected is not easy to compute .",
    "we can only derive a lower limit assuming that the beginning of the flare is coincident with the beginning of our observation .",
    "we also assume that the best - fit parameters reported in table[tab : spec2 ] for the first part of the observation are adequate for an average description of the spectral features of the flare .",
    "in such a case , with a minimum flare duration of @xmath54hours the total fluence released amounts to @xmath68erg@xmath23 . with a distance of @xmath69pc",
    "this translates in a total energy release of @xmath70erg , to be compared with the energy released by the quiescent flux of the star in the same amount of time ( @xmath71erg ) .",
    "the quiescent luminosity observed by bepposax is of the order of @xmath72ergs@xmath13 ( see tables[tab : spec2 ] and [ tab : spec1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the recent revision of the system distance by _ hipparcos _ moved the system @xmath73 farther than previously assumed .",
    "this implies that previous estimates of luminosities and total energy release for were underestimate by a factor @xmath35 . taking this into account , the _",
    "beppo_sax observed luminosity is in agreement with those recorded in the previous rosat pspc observation ( dempsey et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; huenemoerder & baluta @xcite ) .",
    "the statistics of our observation eventually do not allow us to perform any time - resolved analysis and the only partial coverage of the phenomenum prevent us to try to model the flare in order to derive more flare parameters and to discriminate between different theoretical scenarios .",
    "a new _ beppo_sax observation of lasting 150ks has been approved , with the aim of detecting a strong flare .",
    "however , even if a large flare is catched and modeling of the flare will become possible , this new observation will not solve the problem of the low coronal metallicities found for this source by different satellites and of their apparent discrepancy with the photospheric values .",
    "this is a topic that will better be addressed with future more sensitive , and with better spectral resolution , x - ray missions like chandra , xmm and astro  e . with these missions",
