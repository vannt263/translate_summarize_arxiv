    "some tasks , due to their complexity , can not be carried out by single individuals .",
    "they need the concourse of sets of people composing teams .",
    "teams provide a structure and means of bringing together people with a suitable mix of individual properties ( such as competences or personality ) . this can encourage the exchange of ideas , their creativity , their motivation and job satisfaction and can actually extend individual capabilities . in turn",
    ", a suitable team can improve the overall productivity , and the quality of the performed tasks .",
    "however , sometimes teams work less effectively than initially expected due to several reasons : a bad balance of their capacities , incorrect team dynamics , lack of communication , or difficult social situations .",
    "team composition is thus a problem that has attracted the interest of research groups all over the world , also in the area of multiagent systems .",
    "mas research has widely acknowledged competences as important for performing tasks of different nature @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of the approaches represent capabilities of agents in a boolean way ( i.e. , an agent either has a required skill or not ) .",
    "this is a simplistic way to model an agent s set of capabilities as it ignores any skill degree . in real life , capabilities are not binary since every individual ( e.g. human or software ) shows different performances for each competence .",
    "additionally , the mas literature has typically disregarded significant organizational psychology findings ( with the exception of several recent , preliminary attempts like @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "numerous studies in organizational psychology @xcite underline the importance of personality traits or _ types _ for team composition .",
    "other studies have focused on how team members should differ or converge in their characteristics , such as experience , personality , level of skill , or gender , among others @xcite , in order to increase performance .    in this paper , we focus on scenarios where a complex task requires the collaboration of individuals within a team .",
    "more precisely , we consider a scenario , where there are _ multiple instances of the same complex task_. the task has a task type and a set of competence requests with competence levels needed to solve the task .",
    "we have a pool of human agents characterized by gender , personality , and a set of competences with competence levels .",
    "our goal is to partition agents into teams so that within a task all competence requirements are covered ( whenever possible ) and team members work well together .",
    "that is , each resulting team is both _ proficient _ ( covers the required competences ) and _ congenial _ ( balances gender and psychological traits ) .",
    "we refer to these teams as _",
    "synergistic teams_. we define the _ synergistic value _ of a team as its balance in terms of competence , personality and gender .",
    "each synergistic team works on the very same task .",
    "this scenario is present in many real - life settings , for instance a classroom or a crowdsourcing task . with this purpose",
    ", we design an algorithm that uses a greedy technique both to match competences with the required ones and at the same time to balance the psychological traits of teams members .",
    "this paper makes the following contributions . to start with ,",
    "we formalise the synergistic team formation problem as the problem of partitioning a group of individuals into teams with limited size .",
    "we provide an approximate local algorithm to solve the team composition problem .",
    "we empirically evaluate the algorithm using real data .",
    "preliminary results show that our algorithm predicts better the performance of teams than the experts that know students social situation , background and competences",
    ".    * outline . * the remaining of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ related ] opens with an overview of the related work .",
    "section  [ pers ] gives the personality background for our model .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the synergistic team composition problem and section  [ sec : teamform ] presents our algorithm to solve the synergistic team composition problem .",
    "then , section  [ sec : results ] presents results of our algorithm in the context of team composition in the classroom . finally , section  [ sec : discuss ] discusses our approach and future work .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , @xcite is the only model that considers both personality and competences while composing teams .",
    "there , the influence of personality on different task allocation strategies ( minimizing either undercompetence or overcompetence ) is studied .",
    "henceforth , this work is the most relevant for us , however there are substantial differences between our work and @xcite .",
    "firstly , authors do not propose an algorithm to compose teams based on _ both _ personality and competences .",
    "secondly , gender balance is not considered in their setting .",
    "finally , @xcite does not provide an evaluation involving real data ( only an agent - based simulation is presented ) .",
    "the rest of the literature relevant to this article is divided into two categories as proposed in @xcite : those that consider agent capacities ( individual and social capabilities of agents ) and those that deal with agent personality ( individual behaviour models ) .    * capacity . * the capacity dimension has been exploited by numerous previous works @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our work , where the competences are graded , in the majority of works agents are assumed to have multiple binary skills ( i.e. , the agent either has a skill or not ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite use agents capabilities to compose one k - robust team for a single task .",
    "a team is @xmath0-robust if removing any @xmath0 members from the team does not affect the completion of the task .",
    "@xcite uses competences and communication cost in a context where tasks sequentially arrive and teams have to be composed to perform them .",
    "each task requires a specific set of competences and the team composition algorithm is such that the workload per agent is fair across teams . *",
    "* in the team formation literature , the only two models to our knowledge considering personality to compose teams are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite uses belbin theory to obtain human predominant",
    "_ roles _ ( we discuss this method in section [ pers ] ) . additionally , the gender is not taken into account while composing heterogeneous teams , which we believe may be important for team congeniality . regarding @xcite , farhangian et al .",
    "use the classical mbti personality test ( this method is discussed in section [ pers ] ) .",
    "they look for the best possible team built around a selected leader . in other words ,",
    "the _ best _ team for a particular task is composed .",
    "gender balance is not considered in this setting .",
    "finally , although @xcite s team composition considered real data , the resulting teams performance was not validated in any real setting ( bayesian theory was used to predict the probability of success in various team composition conditions ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the most prominent approaches to measure human personality and we explain the details of the method we have decided to examine .",
    "personality determines people s behaviour , cognition and emotion .",
    "different personality theorists present their own definitions of personality and different ways to measure it based on their theoretical positions .",
    "the most popular approach is to determine personality through a set of questions .",
    "there have been several simplified schemes developed over the years to profile human personality .",
    "the most populars are :    1 .   the five factor model ( aka ffm or `` big five '' ) , which uses five broad dimensions to describe human personality @xcite ; 2 .",
    "belbin theory @xcite , which provides a theory on how different role types influence teamwork ; and 3 .",
    "the myers - briggs type indicator ( mbti ) scheme designed to indicate psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "ffm personality instruments fail to detect significant sex differences in personality structures .",
    "it is also argued that the big five dimensions are too broad and heterogeneous , and lack the specificity to make accurate predictions in many real - life settings @xcite .",
    "regarding belbin theory , the results of previous studies considering the correlation between team composition and team performance are ambiguous .",
    "even though some research shows weak support or does not show support for this theory at all @xcite , it remains popular .",
    "finally , the mbti measure consists of four dimensions on a binary scale ( e.g. either the person is extrovert or introvert ) . within this approach",
    ", every person falls into one of the sixteen possible combinations of the four letter codes , one letter representing one dimension .",
    "this approach is easy to interpret by non - psychologists , though reliance on dichotomous preference scores rather than continuous scores excessively restricts the level of statistical analysis @xcite .",
    "having considered the arguments above , we have decided to explore a novel method : the post - jungian personality theory , which is a modified version of the myers - briggs type indicator ( mbti ) @xcite , the `` step ii '' version of quenk , hammer and majors @xcite . the questionnaire to determine personality is short , contains only 20 quick questions ( compared to the 93 mbti questions ) .",
    "this is very convenient for both experts wanting to design teams and individuals doing the test since completing the test takes just a few minutes ( for details of the questionnaire , see @xcite ) .",
    "douglass j. wilde claims that it covers the same psychological territory as mbti @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the mbti measure , which consists of four binary dimensions , the post - jungian personality theory uses the _ numerical _ data collected using the questionnaire @xcite .",
    "the results of this method seem promising , since within a decade this novel approach has tripled the fraction of stanford teams awarded national prizes by the lincoln foundation @xcite .",
    "the test is based on the pioneering psychiatrist carl gustav jung s cognitive - mode personality model @xcite .",
    "it has two sets of variable pairs called psychological functions :    * * sensing / intuition ( sn ) *  describes the way of approaching problems * * thinking / feeling ( tf ) *  describes the way of making decisions    and two sets of psychological attitudes :    * * perception / judgment ( pj ) *  describes the way of living * * extroversion / introversion ( ei ) *  describes the way of interacting with the world    for instance , for the feeling - thinking ( tf ) dimension , a value between -1 and 0 means that a person is of the feeling type , and a value between 0 and 1 means she is of the thinking type .",
    "psychological functions and psychological attitudes compose together a personality .",
    "every dimension of a personality ( ei , sn , tf , pj ) is tested by five multiple choice true / false questions .",
    "in this section we introduce and formalise our team composition problem .",
    "first , section [ ssec : basic ] introduces the basic notions of agent , personality , competence , and team , upon which we formalise our problem .",
    "next , we formalise the notion of task assignment for a single team and a single task , and we characterise different types of assignments .",
    "sections [ ssec : proficiency ] and [ ssec : congeniality ] show how to evaluate the proficiency and congeniality degrees of a team . based on these measures , in section [ ssec : synergisticproblem ]",
    "we formalise the _ synergistic team composition problem_.      in our model , we consider that each agent is a human .",
    "we characterise each agent by the following properties :    * a unique _ identifier _ that distinguishes an agent from others ( e.g. i d card number , passport number , employee i d , or student i d ) . *",
    "_ human agents are either a man or a woman . * a _ personality _ represented by four personality traits .",
    "each personality trait is a number between -1 and 1 . *",
    "a _ set of competences_. a competence integrates knowledge , skills , personal values , and attitudes that enable an agent to act correctly in a job , task or situation @xcite .",
    "each agent is assumed to possess a set of competences with associated competence levels .",
    "this set may vary over time as an agent evolves .",
    "next , we formalise the above - introduced concepts .    a _ personality profile _",
    "is a vector @xmath1 ^ 4 $ ] , where each @xmath2 represents one personality trait .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the whole set of competences , where each element @xmath4 stands for a competence .",
    "a _ human agent _ is represented as a tuple @xmath5 such that :    * @xmath6 is the agent s identifier ; * @xmath7 stands for their gender ; * @xmath8 is a personality profile vector @xmath1 ^ 4 $ ] ; * @xmath9}$ ] is a function that assigns the probability that the agent will successfully show competence @xmath10 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath11 as the _ competence level _ of the agent for competence @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that when an agent does not have a competence ( or we do not know about it ) , the level of this competence is zero .",
    "henceforth , we will note the set of agents as @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , we will use super - indexes to refer to agents components .",
    "for instance , given an agent @xmath13 , @xmath14 will refer to the @xmath6 component of agent @xmath15 .",
    "we will employ matrix @xmath16^{n \\times m}$ ] to represent the competence levels for each agent and each competence .",
    "a _ team _ is any non - empty subset of @xmath17 with at least two agents .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 @xmath19 the set of all possible teams in @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that agents in teams coordinate their activities for mutual benefit .      in this section",
    "we focus on how to assign a team to a task .",
    "a task type determines the competence levels required for the task as well as the importance of each competence with respect to the others .",
    "for instance , some tasks may require a high level of creativity because they were never performed before ( so there are no qualified agents in this matter ) .",
    "others may require a highly skilled team with a high degree of coordination and teamwork ( as it is the case for rescue teams ) .",
    "therefore , we define a task type as :    a task type @xmath20 is defined as a tuple + @xmath21 such that :    * @xmath22 $ ] importance given to proficiency ; * @xmath23 $ ] importance given to congeniality ; * @xmath24 is a competence required to perform the task ; * @xmath25 $ ] is the required competence level for competence @xmath26 ; * @xmath27 $ ] is the importance of competence @xmath26 for the success of task of type @xmath20 ; and * @xmath28 .",
    "we will discuss the meaning of @xmath29 and @xmath30 further ahead when defining synergistic team composition ( see subsection [ ssec : synergisticproblem ] ) .",
    "then , we define a task as :    a _ task _ @xmath31 is a tuple @xmath32 such that @xmath20 is a task type and @xmath33 is the required number of agents , where @xmath34 .",
    "henceforth , we denote by @xmath35 the set of tasks and by @xmath36 the set of task types .",
    "moreover , we will note as @xmath37 the set of competences required by task type @xmath20 .",
    "given a team and a task type , we must consider how to assign competences to team members ( agents ) .",
    "our first , weak notion of task assignment only considers that all competences in a task type are assigned to some agent(s ) in the team :    given a task type @xmath20 and a team @xmath38 , an assignment is a function @xmath39 satisfying that @xmath40 .",
    "[ ssec : proficiency ]    given a task assignment for a team , next we will measure the _ degree of competence _ of the team as a whole",
    ". this measure will combine both the degree of under - competence and the degree of over - competence , which we formally define first . before that",
    ", we must formally identify the agents that are assigned to each competence as follows .    given a task type @xmath20 , a team @xmath41 , and an assignment @xmath42 , the set @xmath43 stands for the agents assigned to cover competence @xmath44 .",
    "now we are ready to define the degrees of undercompentence and overcompetence .    given a task type @xmath20 , a team @xmath41 , and an assignment @xmath42 , we define the degree of undercompetence of the team for the task as : @xmath45    given a task type @xmath20 , a team @xmath41 , and an assignment @xmath42 , we define the degree of overcompetence of the team for the task as : @xmath46    given a task assignment for a team , we can calculate its competence degree to perform the task by combining its overcompetence and undercompetence as follows",
    ".    given a task type @xmath20 , a team @xmath41 and an assignment @xmath42 , the competence degree of the team to perform the task is defined as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 $ ] is the penalty given to the undercompetence of team @xmath41 .",
    "notice that the larger the value of @xmath49 the higher the importance of the competence degree of team @xmath41 , while the lower the value @xmath49 , the less important its undercompetence .",
    "the intuition here is that we might want to penalize more the undercompetency of teams , as some tasks strictly require teams to be at least as competent as defined in the task type .",

    "[ prop1 ]    given that ( 1 ) @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] ; ( 2 ) if @xmath52 then @xmath53 ; and ( 3 ) if @xmath54 then @xmath55 .",

    "function @xmath65 is used to measure how proficient a team is for a given task assignment . however",
    ", counting on the required competences to perform a task does not guarantee that the team will succeed at performing it .",
    "therefore , in the next subsection we present an evaluation function to measure _ congeniality _ within teams . unlike our measure for proficiency , which is based on considering a particular task assignment , our congeniality measure will solely rely on the personalities and genders of the members of a team .",
    "[ ssec : congeniality ]    inspired by the experiments of douglass j. wilde @xcite we will define the team utility function for congeniality @xmath66 , such that :    * it values more teams whose sn and tf personality dimensions are as diverse as possible ; * it prefers teams with at least one agent with positive ei and tf dimensions and negative pj dimension , namely an extrovert , thinking and judging agent ( called etj personality ) , * it values more teams with at least one introvert agent ; * it values gender balance in a team .",
    "therefore , the higher the value of function @xmath66 , the more diverse the team is . formally , this team utility function is defined as follows : @xmath67 where the different parameters are explained next .",
    "* @xmath68 and @xmath69 : these variances are computed over the sn and tf personality dimensions of the members of team @xmath41 . since we want to maximise @xmath70 , we want these variances to be as large as possible .",

    "@xmath89 is a parameter to weigh the importance of a gender balance and @xmath90 .",
    "notice that for a perfectly gender balanced team with @xmath91 we have that @xmath92 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath89 , the more important is that team @xmath70 is gender balanced . similarly to reasoning about @xmath73 and @xmath87 , we assess @xmath93 . in order to make this factor less important than the others in the equation we experimentally assessed that @xmath94 is a good compromise .    in summary",
    ", we will use a utility function @xmath70 such that : @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath94 .      depending on the task type , different importance for congeniality and proficiency should be given .",
    "for instance , creative tasks require a high level of communication and exchange of ideas , and hence , teams require a certain level of congeniality . while , repetitive tasks require good proficiency and less communication . the importance of proficiency ( @xmath29 ) and congeniality ( @xmath30 ) is therefore a fundamental aspect of the task type .",
    "now , given a team , we can combine its competence value ( in equation [ eq : uprof ] ) with its congeniality value ( in equation [ eq : ucon ] ) to measure its _",
    "synergistic value_.    given a team @xmath41 , a task type @xmath97 and a task assignment @xmath98 , the synergistic value of team @xmath41 is defined as : @xmath99 where @xmath22 $ ] is the grade to which the proficiency of team @xmath41 is important , and @xmath23 $ ] is the grade to which the task requires diverse personalities .    at ( axis cs:0.25,0.5 )    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     ;    ( axis cs:0,-1 ) rectangle ( axis cs:0.5,1 ) ; ( 0,0 )  ( 1,0 ) ;    [ tbl : parameters ]    figure [ tbl : parameters ] shows the relation between the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in general , the higher the @xmath29 ,",
    "the higher importance is given to the proficiency of a team .",
    "the higher the @xmath30 the more important is personality diversity .",
    "notice , that the @xmath30 can be lower than zero .",
    "having @xmath30 negative , we impose that the congeniality value will be as low as possible ( to maximize @xmath100 ) and so , team homogeneity is preferred .",
    "this situation may happen while performing tasks in unconventional performance environments that have serious consequences associated with failure . in order to quickly resolve issues",
    ", a team needs to be proficient and have team - mates who understand one another with minimum communication cost ( which is associated to homogeneity of a team ) .      in what follows",
    "we consider that there are multiple instances of the same task to perform . given a set of agents @xmath17 ,",
    "our goal is to split them into teams so that each team , and the whole partition of agents into teams , is balanced in terms of competences , personality and gender .",
    "we shall refer to these balanced teams as _ synergistic teams _",
    ", meaning that they are both congenial and proficient .",
    "therefore , we can regard our team composition problem as a particular type of set partition problem .",
    "we will refer to any partition of @xmath17 as a team partition .",

    "as @xmath107 is not necessarily a natural number , we may need to allow for some flexibility in team size within a partition .",
    "this is why we introduced above the condition @xmath104 . in practical terms , in a partition we may have teams differing by one agent .",
    "we note by @xmath108 the set of all team partitions of @xmath17 constrained by size @xmath33 .",
    "henceforth , we will focus on team partitions constrained by some size . since our goal is to find the most competence - balanced and psychologically - balanced team partition",

    "notice that the use of a bernoulli - nash function over the synergistic values of teams will favour team partitions whose synergistic values are balanced .",
    "now we are ready to cast the synergistic team composition problem as the following optimisation problem :    given task @xmath109 and set of agents @xmath17 the * synergistic team formation problem ( stfp ) * is the problem of finding a team partition constrained by size @xmath33 , together with competence assignment for its teams , whose synergistic value is maximal .",
    "formally , the stfp is the problem of finding the partition in @xmath114 and the task assignments @xmath112 for the teams in @xmath101 that maximises @xmath115 .",
    "in this section we detail an algorithm , the so - called _ _ , which solves the synergistic team formation problem described above",
    ". we will start from describing how to split agents into a partition ( see subsection [ ssec : dist ] ) .",
    "next , we will move on to the problem of assigning competences in a task to team members ( see subsection [ ssec : asg ] ) , so that the utility of synergistic function is maximal .",
    "finally , we will explain _ _ that is a greedy algorithm that quickly finds a first , local solution , to subsequently improve it , hoping to reach a global optimum .",
    "we note by @xmath116 the number of agents in @xmath17 , by @xmath117 the target number of agents in each team , and by @xmath118 the minimum total number of teams , @xmath119 .",
    "we define the quantity distribution of agents in teams of a partition , noted @xmath120 as : @xmath121    note that depending on the cardinality of @xmath17 and the desired team size , the number of agents in each team may vary by one individual ( for instance if there are @xmath122 agents in @xmath17 and we want to compose duets ( @xmath123 ) , we split agents into two duets and one triplet ) .",
    "there are different methods to build an assignment .",
    "we have decided to solve our assignment problem by using the minimum cost flow model @xcite .",
    "this is one of the most fundamental problems within network flow theory and it can be efficiently solved .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , it was proven that the minimum cost flow problem can be solved in @xmath124 time with @xmath125 nodes and @xmath33 arcs .",
    "our problem is as follows : there are a number of agents in team @xmath41 and a number of competence requests in task @xmath31 .",
    "any agent can be assigned to any competence , incurring some cost that varies depending on the agent competence level of the assigned competence .",
    "we want to get each competence assigned to at least one agent and each agent assigned to at least one competence in such a way that the total cost ( that is both undercompetence and overcompetence ) of the assignment is minimal with respect to all such assignments .",
    "formally , let @xmath126 be a directed network defined by a set @xmath127 of @xmath125 nodes and a set @xmath128 of @xmath129 directed arcs .",
    "there are four types of nodes : ( 1 ) one source node ; ( 2 ) @xmath130 nodes that represent agents in team @xmath41 ; ( 3 ) @xmath131 competence requests that form task type @xmath20 ; and ( 4 ) one sink node .",
    "each @xmath132 @xmath133 has an associated cost @xmath134 that denotes the cost per unit flow on that @xmath132 .",
    "we also associate with each @xmath132 @xmath133 a capacity @xmath135 that denotes the maximum amount that can flow on the arc .",
    "in particular , we have three kinds of edges : ( 1 ) supply arcs . these edges",
    "connect the source to agent nodes .",
    "each of these arcs has zero cost and a positive capacity @xmath136 which define how many competences at most can be assigned to each agent . ( 2 ) transportation arcs .",
    "these are used to ship supplies .",
    "every transportation edge @xmath133 is associated with a shipment cost @xmath137 that is equal to : @xmath138 where @xmath139 $ ] is the penalty given to the undercompetence of team @xmath41(see subsection [ ssec : prof ] for the definition ) .",
    "( 3 ) demand arcs .",
    "these arcs connect the competence requests nodes to the sink node .",

    "an alternative way to measure students competences level can be by calculating the collective assessments of each competence ( like proposed by @xcite ) .    finally , having competences ( intelligences ) , personality and actual performance of all students , we are able to calculate synergistic values for each team .",
