    "asymmetry in the charge pumping relative to the sign of the chirp rate was discussed in our recent publication ( see fig .  4 in ref .  ) .",
    "one of the reasons for the asymmetry is related to the time spent by the local pulse in the region of frequencies at and just below the resonance .",
    "this region provides the main contribution to charge transfer ( see discussion of fig .  3 in ref .",
    ") . since time spent in this region by the positively chirped pulse is smaller than that by the pulse with equal negative chirp rate ( the positively chirped local pulse is shorter ) , one expects to observe an asymmetry as represented by the result of calculations using local em field influenced only by spp modes driving the junction ( see curve with triangles in fig .  [ fig6 ] )",
