    "the coexistence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) long - range order of the ru moments with a superconducting ( sc ) state in the ruthenate - cuprates rusr@xmath2rcu@xmath22o@xmath23 ( ru-1212 ) and rusr@xmath2(r , ce)@xmath2cu@xmath2o@xmath5 ( ru-1222 ) , where r = gd , eu , has been intensively studied in the recent years.bauernfeind , mclaughlin , bernhard , liu , felner02 , xue02 , williams02 , williams03 among several major open issues , the interplay between the transport properties and magnetism has received a great deal of attention.@xcite on the other hand , there are few reports on the intergrain properties , which exhibit very interesting features . the broad resistive sc transition ( @xmath24 @xmath25 15 - 20 k ) observed in good quality ru-1212 ceramic samples has been consistently explained in terms of a strong intergrain contribution and spontaneous vortex phase formation in the grains , as evidenced through microwave resistivity measurements in powders dispersed in an epoxy resin.@xcite an abrupt reduction in the suppression rate of the intergranular flux activation energy with the increase in magnetic field has been observed at @xmath8 = 0.1 t in polycrystalline ru-1212 , through a study of the @xmath26-@xmath27 characteristic curves.@xcite this behavior has been ascribed to a spin - flop transition of the ru - sub - lattice , leading to a decrease of the effective local field at the junctions . in addition , a preliminary report@xciteon @xmath26-@xmath27 curves for ru-1222 suggests that the low values obtained for the intergranular current density @xmath11 is possibly related to its magnetic behavior , indicating that more investigation is needed to clarify this point .",
    "the peak of the sc intergrain transition , as determined from the derivative of the resistive curves , is quite intense and narrow in both ruthenate - cuprate systems.@xcite this result is at variance with the high-@xmath20 cuprates , exhibiting a smeared intergrain peak of small amplitude as a consequence of a broad - in - temperature phase - lock process across a wide distribution of link qualities .",
    "the results for the ruthenate - cuprates have been interpreted as a consequence of the effects of the ru - magnetization on the grain boundaries , in such a way that the intergrain percolation occurs only through a fraction of high quality junctions.@xcite these reports clearly evidence that the magnetization in the grains leaves a sizable effect in the connectivity of the weak link network .",
    "whether this unique feature of the ruthenate - cuprates changes the essentials of the intergrain properties in comparison to the high-@xmath20 superconductors remains an open issue ; a quantitative determination of the parameters characterizing the intergrain coupling in these compounds is still lacking .",
    "since the early works in the high-@xmath20 superconductors , ac magnetic susceptibility has proved to be a useful tool to characterize their granular properties.@xcite in particular , a critical state model for granular superconductors was used to calculate the temperature , and both ac and dc magnetic field dependence of the complex susceptibility , @xmath28 , for sintered bulk samples of yba@xmath22cu@xmath14o@xmath15 ( ybco),@xcite ( bi , pb)@xmath2sr@xmath2ca@xmath2cu@xmath14o@xmath5 and bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath23,muller91 with excellent results . in this investigation",
    "we present detailed measurements of the ac magnetic susceptibility as a function of frequency @xmath29 and amplitude @xmath30 of the driving field in polycrystalline rusr@xmath2gd@xmath31ce@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath32 .",
    "we show that the simple models proposed to describe the dependence on these parameters of the imaginary part of the susceptibility , @xmath7 , in the conventional cuprates@xcite quantitatively accounts for the behavior of the dissipation peak in ru-1222 . nevertheless , the parameters characterizing the intergrain properties , as the pinning potential depth , the full penetration field and the critical current density , are considerably lower in ru-1222 as compared to the high-@xmath20 cuprates .",
    "we propose that these results are due to effects of the ru magnetization within the grains on the connectivity of the weak link network . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "as already mentioned , the critical state model has been successfully used to characterize the granular properties of high-@xmath20 superconductors . in particular",
    ", it was shown that a flux creep term added to the current density term in the critical state equation accurately accounts for the shift in the @xmath7 peak to higher temperatures with increasing frequency of the ac field.@xcite in the following , we briefly review the essential ideas of this approach necessary to conduct the discussion ; details can be found in the previously mentioned reports .",
    "we compare our results with bulk ybco , for which more detailed data is available",
    ". one interesting prediction of the model is that larger shifts should be observed with decreasing average grain size and critical current density at the intergrain junctions.@xcite since the connectivity of the weak link network in ru-1222 is expected to be affected by the ru - magnetization in the grains and the ru-1222 average grain radius @xmath50 @xmath25 1 @xmath18 m is lower than those reported for the ybco sample ( @xmath177 - 10 @xmath18 m ) , this compound is a suitable material to verify this point .",
    "the five times larger temperature shift @xmath51 due to a frequency variation , observed for ru-1222 as compared with ybco [ @xmath52(ybco)@xmath170.4 k @xcite ] for the same @xmath39 interval confirms these predictions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath8*(@xmath49 ) for the ru-1222 bulk sample is reduced by a factor of four [ @xmath53*(@xmath49)@xmath54 = 20 oe for @xmath29 = 1 khz @xcite ] , also pointing to a weak intergrain connectivity .",

    "as the frequency is increased , the intergranular vortices have less time to creep into the superconductor during each ac cycle .",
    "then , in order to obtain the full penetration condition , a weaker intergranular pinning force density is needed to compensate a less efficient creep . since the pinning force density weakens with increasing temperature , @xmath37 must increase with the rise in frequency .        where @xmath59(@xmath60 ) is the local macroscopic flux density due to the external field , @xmath60 is the coordinate perpendicular to the slab , and @xmath61(@xmath8,@xmath9 ) is the pinning force density given by      where @xmath0(@xmath63 ) is the pinning depth potential",

    "( 6 ) for the calculation of @xmath11(0 , 0)@xmath70 requires the knowledge of @xmath19(0 ) .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the intragrain london penetration length has some peculiarities in the ruthenate - cuprates .",
    "it has been demonstrated for ru-1222 that the intragrain superfluid density 1/@xmath85 does not follow by far the linear correlation with @xmath33 observed for homogeneous cuprates.@xcite also , it was found that @xmath19 is very sensitive to the partial pressure of oxygen during the final annealing , varying between 0.4 @xmath18 m",

    "instead , we look for a confirmation of the validity of the critical state model by taking the @xmath11(0 , 0)@xmath70 value obtained from the frequency shift , and derive @xmath19(0 ) . taking @xmath11(0 ,",

    "this should be related not only to the underdoped character of the ruthenate - cuprates , as revealed by hall effect and thermopower measurements,@xcite but also to a very distinctive feature of these compounds .",
    "both ru-1212 and ru-1222 exhibit structural domains of coherent rotated ruo@xmath21 octahedra , separated by antiphase boundaries with local distortions and defects.@xcite this characteristic has been proposed to be the source of the strong intragrain granularity observed in these compounds , with the boundaries acting as intragrain josephson junctions between the structural domains.garcia03a within this scenario , the magnetic field penetrates the grains not only through their crystallographic borders but also through the antiphase boundaries , increasing the penetrated volume and leading to an enhanced effective @xmath19 and to a small and sometimes missing meissner signal .",
    "therefore , the obtained @xmath19(0 ) provides a reliable estimate , and confirms the validity of the critical state approach .",
    "finally , we address the magnitude of the local field at the intergranular junctions due to the ru magnetization , @xmath91 .",
    "the use of the critical state model , leading to a decreasing field profile in the ceramic as its center is approached , is valid only if the external field is comparable to @xmath92 . in the case where @xmath30 is much smaller than @xmath91 ,",
    "its effect on the connectivity of the weak link network is negligible , and no amplitude dependence for the position of the @xmath7-peaks would be observed . in other words",
    ", a large @xmath91 will result in a flat intrinsic field profile unaffected by @xmath30 .",
    "magnetic fields of the order of 600 - 700 oe have been measured by muon spin rotation@xcite and gd - electron paramagnetic resonance@xcite in sites located near to the ruo@xmath2 layers .",
    "however , the dipolar field rapidly decays with distance , and the local field at the junctions can be considerably smaller . defects and imperfections in the region of the intergrain boundaries can locally affect the magnetic order of the ru moments , diminishing the effective field . an estimation of @xmath91 can be performed using the value reported for the intergrain critical current in the isomorphous non - ferromagnetic nb-1222 compound ( @xmath93 = 1545 a/@xmath12 at @xmath94 = 5 k ) @xcite ) .",
