    "interference is inherent to any fully connected multi - user wireless network .",
    "as the number of devices sharing the spectrum with high rate demands grows , wireless networks become more and more interference limited .",
    "the significance of interference on the operation of a wireless network renders it natural to focus on its high snr performance to obtain design insights and characterize the interaction between the signals .",
    "thus , degrees of freedom ( dof ) , which characterizes the scaling of the transmission rates of wireless networks in high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) regime , is an important metric to measure the performance of an interference - limited system .",
    "interference alignment was shown to achieve the optimal dof for a variety of interference - limited wireless networks @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors have shown that the optimal dof @xmath2 can be achieved for the 2-user multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) x channel with @xmath3 antennas at each node , using symbol extensions and interference alignment , demonstrating the achievability of non - integer dof @xmath4 with constant channel for @xmath5 . for @xmath6 with constant channels , the dof @xmath7 is shown to be achievable in @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite further generalized the result to the @xmath0 user x channel , and showed that the optimal dof is @xmath8 with single antenna nodes and a time - varying channel .",
    "reference @xcite showed that interference alignment achieves the optimal dof of the @xmath1-user interference channel , @xmath9 , with single antenna nodes and time - varying channel .",
    "follow up studies on the dof of the interference channels , for example , the simo interference channel , the @xmath1-user @xmath0 mimo interference channel , and interference channel with cooperation and cognition , can be found in references @xcite .    to effectively implement interference alignment , it is crucial to have global instant csit which can be difficult to obtain for practical systems",
    ". reference @xcite has studied the dof region of the @xmath10-user mimo broadcast channel and the @xmath10-user mimo interference channel without csit , and loss of dof is observed for many scenarios of interest .",
    "reference @xcite has further generalized the results to @xmath1-user broadcast and interference channels , and also derived outerbounds on dof region for the @xmath1-user x channel .",
    "this reference has established that without csit , the transmitters can not steer the signals to the exact desired directions to guarantee that the interference is aligned together at the receivers , which causes the performance degradation in terms of dof .    while loss of dof is observed when no csit is available at the transmitters , reference @xcite has observed that as long as the channel s correlation structure is known at the transmitters , without any knowledge of the exact channel coefficient , interference alignment is still possible for certain wireless networks .",
    "reference @xcite has further developed this idea and proposed the blind interference alignment strategies using staggered antennas , which can artificially create the desired channel correlation pattern by switching the antennas used by the receivers . for systems where csit is completely unknown",
    "however , loss of dof appears to be inevitable .",
    "a more practical assumption about csit is that the transmitter may have delayed csi .",
    "the delayed csit model characterizes the channel variation and the delay in the feedback of csi from receivers , and thus is important from both theoretical and practical perspective .",
    "the delayed csit assumption is first studied in the context of the @xmath1-user broadcast channel @xcite , i.e. , a channel with a transmitter having @xmath1 antennas and @xmath1 receivers each with a single antenna , where the transmitter has accurate and global csit delayed by several time slots .",
    "it is shown that the delayed csit can be useful for interference alignment and the dof can be improved significantly compared to the case without csit .",
    "this delayed csit assumption is then applied to various channel models such as the general broadcast channels , interference channels and x channels , and improvement on the dof compared to the cases without csit can be found in references @xcite .",
    "the delayed csit is an interesting assumption which , in fact , shows that feedback of delayed csi can provide capacity gain for multi - destination wireless networks , which is in contrast with various single - destination models @xcite .",
    "however , there is a performance degradation with the delayed csit assumption compared to when global csit is available .",
    "for example , the dof for the @xmath1-user broadcast channel with delayed csit is shown in @xcite to be @xmath11 , whereas with global csit , the optimal dof is @xmath1 .",
    "the operation of relaying , although is beneficial in improving the achievable rates for many multi - user wireless networks @xcite , is shown in reference @xcite to be unable to provide dof gain for the fully connected interference channel and x channel with full csi at all nodes . in this context , relaying is shown to be useful only to facilitate interference alignment for some specific scenarios .",
    "for quasi - static channels , references @xcite have proposed strategies to utilize the relay to randomize the channel coefficients at the receivers , and the optimal dof can be achieved although the channel is not time varying within the transmission blocks .",
    "reference @xcite has proposed relay - aided interference alignment schemes that can achieve the optimal dof of the @xmath1-user interference channel with finite time extensions . for networks that have limited csi ,",
    "it is shown in reference @xcite that using a relay , the optimal dof for the @xmath1-user interference channel can be achieved when all the nodes have local csi only , provided that the relay has more antennas than the total number of single - antenna transmitters . for networks that are not fully connected , for example ,",
    "the multi - hop relay networks , references @xcite have studied the dof under either global csit or delayed csit assumptions .",
    "whereas the study of relaying on the dof of fully connected wireless networks so far focused on using relays to facilitate interference alignment , in this work , we aim to theoretically study the impact of relaying on the dof from another perspective .",
    "we focus on understanding whether , and to what extent , relays can improve the dof of wireless networks when the source nodes , i.e. , the transmitters , are _ blind _ in the sense that no csit is available . in this paper , we mainly consider the case when relays have global csi as a first step to investigate the impact of relays on the dof of wireless networks without csit .",
    "the justification of the setting is that it is likely that the relay nodes are located in between the sources and the destinations and could have access to more accurate csi .",
    "the relays can be small base stations at fixed locations with more power resources and computing capability , and obtaining csi can be less challenging .",
    "specifically , we study the dof of the x channel and the interference channel with single - antenna users and half - duplex multi - antenna relays , where no csi is available at the transmitters , but global csi can be obtained at the relays and the receivers .",
    "we first design a _ joint beamforming _ based transmission scheme for the general @xmath0 x channel with relays .",
    "we show that when each relay is equipped with @xmath12 antennas , with @xmath13 relays , the dof @xmath8 can be achieved , which is the same optimal dof as the case when csit is available .",
    "we then consider two special cases : the @xmath1-user x channel with a multiple antenna relay and the @xmath1-user x channel with single antenna relays .",
    "for the case when relay nodes are only equipped with single antenna , the optimal dof can be achieved with @xmath14 relays . for the case with one multiple antenna relay",
    ", we can design a different scheme with less computational complexity that uses _ partial interference alignment _ at the relay and joint beamforming to show the achievability of optimal dof @xmath15 using one relay with @xmath16 antennas .",
    "note that in the above results , the channel is required to be time varying in order to achieve the optimal dof .",
    "an interesting feature of the dof optimal interference alignment scheme using relays is that only finite channel usage is required to achieve the exact optimal dof , whereas for the general @xmath0 x channel without relays but with csit , infinite channel uses are required .",
    "the case when there is no csit but relays only have delayed csi is also investigated .",
    "using the techniques developed for the x channel , we further show that interference alignment is possible for the @xmath1-user interference channel without csit with the help of half - duplex relays .",
    "for the general case , we design a two - slot transmission scheme using joint beamforming , and show that it requires @xmath17 relays with @xmath12 antennas to achieve the dof @xmath18 , which is exactly the same optimal dof as the case with csit .",
    "we then consider two special cases : the case with one relay with @xmath16 antennas , and the case with @xmath19 single antenna relays .",
    "note that the special case when the relay has @xmath16 antennas is also investigated in reference @xcite .",
    "when we have one relay with @xmath16 antennas , joint beamforming is not necessary for interference alignment and the channel does not need to be time varying .",
    "however , when we have @xmath19 relays each with a single antenna , joint beamforming is required to achieve interference alignment and the channel does need to be time varying .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated relay - aided interference alignment schemes for the x channel and the interference channel , when no channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitters ( csit ) is available . in particular ,",
    "we have considered models where intermediate relay nodes have access to csi , and can compensate for the lack of csi at the transmitters .",
    "we have first investigated the @xmath0 x channel without csit assisted by relays with global csi .",
    "we have designed a transmission scheme and established sufficient conditions between the number of relays and the number of antennas at the relays such that the same optimal dof as the case when csit is available can be achieved . for the @xmath1-user interference channel without csit ,",
    "we have shown that relays can provide interference alignment to achieve the optimal dof @xmath9 using a 2-slot transmission scheme . in general , we have shown that the optimal dof @xmath9 can be achieved using @xmath17 relays with @xmath12 antennas .    in this paper , the focus has been on recovering the optimal dof using relays with global csi , as if transmitters had global csi when in reality they have none .",
    "an interesting direction is quantifying the impact of partial or delayed csi at the relays on the dof in the presence of delayed or zero csi at the transmitters .",
    "this is left as future work .",
    "we denote the message from transmitter @xmath28 to receiver @xmath34 as @xmath139 .",
    "we wish to send @xmath267 messages in @xmath268 channel uses . in the first @xmath1 slots , the transmitters",
    "send the messages to the relay and the receivers , and in the rest @xmath16 slots , the relay performs partial interference alignment and joint beamforming with the transmitters to align all the interference into a @xmath16 dimensional space .",
    "now we need to obtain the vectors @xmath274 to partially align the interference at the receivers .",
    "we let @xmath275 where @xmath276 .",
    "since we have exactly @xmath16 equations to solve for @xmath16 variables , and the channel coefficients are drawn from the continuous distribution , there exist non - zero vectors @xmath277 almost surely .",
    "for each @xmath279 , we choose a weighting coefficient @xmath280 , where @xmath281 , and a beamforming vector @xmath204 .",
    "we choose the beamforming vectors such that @xmath282^t)$ ] , where @xmath283 $ ] denotes a matrix taking the vector @xmath284 as its columns for all @xmath285 .",
    "the matrix @xmath286^t$ ] has dimension @xmath287 , and thus its null space is non - empty , which guarantees the existence of @xmath204 .            for receiver @xmath44 , @xmath293 , @xmath70 ,",
    "are the messages that it needs to decode , which should span a @xmath1 dimensional space .",
    "there are a total of @xmath268 dimensions available for the received signals , and hence we should align the rest interference signals into a @xmath16 dimensional space . with the help of the relay ,",
    "we have already aligned the interfering data streams @xmath294 , into a one dimensional space for each fixed @xmath100 .",
    "if we can steer the data stream @xmath295 into the same dimension of the signal space , then we are able to keep all the interference into a @xmath16 dimensional space .",
    "this is feasible by choosing the parameters @xmath296 such that equation at the beginning of previous page is satisfied for all @xmath297 .",
    "it is easy to verify that after aligning the interference , the intended messages @xmath293 occupy a @xmath1-dimensional space , which does not intersect with the @xmath201-dimensional space of the interfering signals , and thus they can be decoded using a zero - forcing decoder to completely eliminate the interference .",
    "therefore we are able to send @xmath267 messages with @xmath268 slots , and the dof @xmath15 is achievable .",
