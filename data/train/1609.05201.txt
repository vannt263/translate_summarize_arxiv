    "present astrophysical observational programmes monitoring compact stars ( cs ) have provided new , high - quality data for their static properties , thermal and spin evolution .",
    "these modern measurements constrain the equation of state ( eos ) and the transport properties of dense matter in cs interiors @xcite , for a recent review see  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the evidence for high masses @xcite and large radii @xcite of css , suggests that the eos at high densities must be sufficiently stiff .",
    "this prompts the question for the possibility of deconfined quark matter at css interiors @xcite . in this debate",
    ", it has been demonstrated that microscopic models of quark matter eos allow for extended quark cores of cs , while satisfying current mass and radius constraints @xcite .",
    "this offers still a broad spectrum of possible realizations of hybrid stars in nature , as classified recently in ref .",
    "the two extreme scenarios are the _ masquerade _ case @xcite , where the corresponding quark - hadron hybrid stars appear to have almost identical static properties to pure neutron stars , and the _ high - mass twin _",
    "case @xcite associated with a strong first - order phase transition .",
    "the latter can be identified by observing css with similar high masses ( such as psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite ) but significantly different radii .",
    "this requires an accuracy of radius measuments of about 500 m , as it shall be provided by the nicer mission of nasa @xcite , planned for launch in the near future . in the case of a smooth cross - over transition ,",
    "i.e. the masquerade case , precise observations of cs mass and/or radii will not allow to provide evidence for the existence of quark matter at their interiors .",
    "in such a situation , the transport properties of dense matter may provide the decisive diagnostic tool via the cooling history of cs .",
    "besides cold css , also in protoneutron stars ( pns ) the transport properties play a crucial role .",
    "pnss are born hot and lepton rich in the violent event of a core - collapse supernova .",
    "they deleptonize and cool on a timescale on the order of 1030  s via the emission of neutrinos of all flavors @xcite .",
    "the appearance and role of quark matter in pns and core - collapse supernovae has long been studied by means of conducting numerical studies @xcite , also in particular as the trigger of the actual supernova explosion via a strong first - order phase transition at high density .",
    "this launches a strong hydrodynamics shock wave , in addition of the standard supernova standing bounce shock , and the release of an outburst of neutrinos of all flavors @xcite .",
    "those neutrinos are released during the shock passage across the neutrinospheres of last scattering , located always at low densities where matter is composed of hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the future observation of such neutrino signal may reveal yet unknown details of the associated with the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "the caveat in all these studies was the treatment of neutrino interactions in quark matter , which was treated at the level of nucleons only .",
    "this approximation is valid when temperatures are on the order of 10  mev or above .",
    "however , during the long - term evolution of deleptonizing protoneutron star , as the core temperature decreases below about 1  mev , weak interactions at the quark level become important . unlike in studies of cooling cs , where neutrino - quark interactions are treated at different levels of sophistication @xcite , for supernova studies the general framework has to be derived along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the cooling and spin evolution of cs depends sensitively on the thermal and transport properties of dense matter , the latter can be determined from the observation of cooling css , with particular emphasis on young objects like cassiopeia  a @xcite .",

    "if quark matter is present in the cs interior we expect it to be in a color - superconducting state which entails a strong dependence on the pairing pattern and the sizes of pairing gaps . in the present study",
    ", we will focus on the discussion of direct urca neutrino emissivities and bulk viscosities of color - superconducting quark matter .",
    "the numerical analysis is based on a nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) type model , allowing a consistent description of the density and temperature dependent quark masses , pairing gaps and chemical potentials under neutron star constraints .",
    "the resulting phase diagram suggests that three - flavor phases of the color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) type occur only at rather high densities @xcite and render hybrid star configurations gravitationally unstable @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to large pairing gaps in cfl quark matter , the r - mode instabilities can not be damped @xcite and cooling is inhibited @xcite .    by this reasoning , we shall focus on two - flavor quark matter as the relevant case for discussion of quark deconfinement in css as well as in the protoneutron star evolution during supernova collapse . due to the pairing instability the scalar antitriplet diquark correlations form a condensate in the color superconducting 2sc phase with a critical temperature @xmath0 that is on the order of @xmath1 mev @xcite . within the polyakov - loop extension of the njl model",
    ", this temperature may even reach up to the pseudocritical temperature @xmath2 mev found in recent lattics qcd simulations @xcite for the chiral and polyakov - loop transition at vanishing baryon number densities , see @xcite .",
    "the standard 2sc phase , however , pairs only two of the three colors ( e.g. , red - green ) of quarks , leaving color unpaired ( blue quarks in this example ) on which then the rapid direct urca cooling process may proceed , too rapid in comparison with compact star phenomenology .",
    "this problem has prompted the introduction of a purely phenomenological gap ( x - gap ) for the quarks of the unpaired color @xcite .",
    "for a recent investigation of such a fully gapped 2sc phase see @xcite , which may be contrasted to the transport @xcite and cooling properties @xcite in the original 2sc phase . in this context",
    "also the anisotropic crystalline color superconductivity phases have been discussed , which have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is an unsatisfactory situation to have no candidate for the microscopic pairing pattern that could justify the phenomenological x - phase in the 2sc+x model of the fully gapped 2sc phase .",
    "one alternative is provided by the isotropic color - spin - locking ( iso - csl ) phase suggested in @xcite modifying earlier work on spin-1 color superconducting phases @xcite . the iso - csl phase is a single flavor pairing scheme and therefore rather inert against isospin asymmetry and strong magnetic fields , thus qualifying as a robust pairing pattern for compact star applications .",
    "technically the description of the transport and cooling properties of this phase follows that of the family of spin-1 color superconductors which have been studied in detail in @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we will focus on two - flavor color - superconducting phases in css , the 2sc+x phase of ref .",

    "this will form the basis of further phenomenological in astrophysics , with applications to supernovae and css .",
