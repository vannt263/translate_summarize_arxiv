    "the evolution is more similar to the elastic case with , however , equilibrium states replaced by non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "the velocity distributions in these adiabatic or steady states are very different from a maxwell boltzmann distribution .",
    "the subsequent stage of evolution involves transport phenomena and complex hydrodynamic phenomena of clustering and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "the interest in granular matter in general has strongly stimulated new developments in the kinetic theory of granular fluids and gases , which show surprising new physics .",
    "a granular fluid is a collection of small or large macroscopic particles , with short range repulsive hard core interactions , in which energy is lost in inelastic collisions , and the system cools when not driven . when rapidly driven , gravity can be neglected .",
    "the dynamics is based on binary collisions and ballistic motion between collisions , which _ conserve total momentum_. so these systems can be considered to be a granular _ fluid or gas_. the prototypical model for these so - called rapid granular flows is a fluid or gas of perfectly smooth mono - disperse inelastic hard spheres , and its non - equilibrium behavior can be described by the nonlinear boltzmann equation @xcite .",

    "the intriguing question is , what is the generic feature causing overpopulated tails , possibly even power law tails , in systems of _ inelastic _ particles , how does the overpopulation depend on the scattering cross sections , and on the different forms of energy input .",
    "the generic feature is the mechanism for overpopulation , and not the specific shape of the tails .",
    "finally , from the point of view of nonequilibrium steady states , the structure of velocity distributions in elastic and dissipative systems , including the high energy tail , is a subject of continuing research , as the universality of the gibbs state of thermal equilibrium is lacking outside thermal equilibrium , and a possible classification of generic structures would be of great interest in many fields of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",

    "the exponent in the algebraic tail depends qualitatively in the same manner on the degree of inelasticity as in 2- and 3-dimensional maxwell models . in section 3 the nonlinear boltzmann equation",
    "is constructed for inelastic generalizations of the classical repulsive power law potentials , to which we refer as inelastic repulsive scatterers or irs - models .",
    "this is done for freely cooling as well as for systems driven by thermostats or heat sources .",

    "@xmath471{fig3.eps}\\ ] ]    these results establish the existence of scaling solutions @xmath197 with algebraic tails , where the exponent @xmath16 is the solution of the transcendental equation with @xmath433 .",
    "the exponent @xmath79 behaves as a function of @xmath42 qualitatively the same as in the simple inelastic bgk model of section 2 .    using a somewhat different analysis krapivsky and",
    "ben - naim @xcite independently obtained the same results for the algebraic tails in freely cooling maxwell models .      _ free cooling : _ + as mentioned already in section 3.3 , baldassarri et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained an exact solution @xmath23 of the scaling equation for the one - dimensional maxwell model in free cooling , and they demonstrated the importance of this scaling solution by means of monte carlo simulations . in doing",
    "so they found that @xmath20 for different classes of initial distributions can be collapsed for _ long _ times @xmath256 on this exact scaling solution @xmath23 , when @xmath472 is plotted versus @xmath473 .",
    "we briefly illustrate here how this solution is obtained from the one - dimensional scaling equation .",
    "one first verifies that the following function , @xmath474 with arbitrary positive @xmath475 is a solution , that can be fourier inverted .",
    "it gives the scaling form , @xmath476 to determine the scaling form that satisfies the normalizations , we expand in powers of @xmath477 to obtain , @xmath478 comparison of this result with shows that @xmath479 .",
    "moreover , it confirms the ansatz used to find solutions with small-@xmath405 singularities .",
    "comparison also shows the value of the coefficient @xmath480 $ ] in , and the high energy tail is @xmath481 with @xmath482 $ ] .",
    "the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath483 can not be determined within the asymptotic method .",
    "_ white noise driving : _ + for the one - dimensional maxwell model driven by white noise the steady state solution has also been found exactly with the help of the fourier transform method @xcite .",
    "the characteristic function satisfies in that case a nonlinear finite difference equation , which can be solved by iteration . however , the analytic structure is rather complex , and makes it difficult to extract analytic information from that solution .",
    "the observation that @xmath484 $ ] has an exponential high energy tail , was probably first made in numerical work of van der hart and nienhuis @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analytic prediction about the asymptotic tail was given in @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath485 for all maxwell models , independent of the dimensionality @xmath486 , at least with the normalization , @xmath487 , used in this article .",
    "this result follows directly from and the value @xmath488 , given in item 3 below .",
    "furthermore , additional numerical and analytical work was also published by marconi and puglisi @xcite , and by antal et al .",
    "only recently more detailed analytic results have been extracted from the rather complex structure of the exact solution @xcite .",
    "we have studied asymptotic properties of scaling or similarity solutions , @xmath489 , of the nonlinear boltzmann equation in spatially homogeneous systems composed of particles with _ inelastic _ interactions for large times and large velocities .",
    "the large @xmath490 and @xmath491scales are relevant because on such scales the universal features of the solutions survive , while details of the initial distributions , of interaction strength , and degree of inelasticity , are mostly lost .",
    "the behavior of these scaling states , which describe nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) , is less universal than the state of thermal equilibrium , because the form of the ness distribution @xmath7 depends on the way of driving the dissipative systems .",
    "scaling solutions are very well suited to expose the universal features of the velocity distribution functions , because the velocities , @xmath473 , are measured in units of the r.m.s .",
    "velocity or instantaneous width @xmath32 of the distribution .",
    "the real importance of the scaling solutions is that the actual solutions @xmath0 for large classes of initial distributions @xmath492 ( essentially initial data without over - populated tails -see @xcite ) rapidly approach these scaling solutions in the sense that after a short transient time the data @xmath493 can be collapsed on a single scaling form @xmath23 , as first observed by baldassarri et al . in mc simulations of the nonlinear boltzmann equation for a one - dimensional inelastic maxwell model .",
    "this rapid approach to a universal scaling function applies both to systems driven by a gaussian or by a white noise thermostat , as well as for freely cooling systems , which show scaling behavior , identical to systems driven by a gaussian thermostat .",
    "originally this scenario had the status of a conjecture for systems of inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath3 ) and inelastic maxwell models(@xmath4 ) , as formulated in @xcite where also some analytical evidence for the approach to a scaling form has been presented . for maxwell models",
    "the conjecture has been rigorously proven in the mean time by bobylev et al . @xcite .",
    "the analysis in section 4.1 also suggests what the basic criterion us for the approach of irs - models to the scaling form . if the energy balance equation has a stable / attractive fixed point solution , @xmath494 , then the distribution function @xmath0 approaches  in the sense detailed in the paragraphs above  a stable ness described by the scaling solution .",
    "the analysis in section 4.1 of the energy balance equation also suggests that cases of marginal stability are candidates for power law tails , where the freely evolving inelastic maxwell model is a well known example .",
    "a further candidate system for power law tails is an irs - model with @xmath315 , driven by white noise .",
    "these properties , and the relation between marginal stability and power law tails is further explored in @xcite , where in addition the analytic predictions of the present paper are confirmed by mc simulations .    in this article",
    "we have focussed on the properties of the scaling solution , and in particular on its high energy tail . here",
    "we have introduced the boltzmann equation for new classes of inelastic interactions , named inelastic repulsive scatterers or irs - models , corresponding to pseudo - repulsive power law potentials , with collision probabilities proportional to @xmath495 , covering hard scatterers like inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath328 ) and soft scatterers like pseudo - maxwell molecules ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the energy loss in an inelastic interaction is proportional to the inelasticity , @xmath496 , where @xmath42 is the coefficient of restitution .",
    "we have studied two typical cases : freely evolving systems in homogeneous cooling states , without energy supply , and systems with energy supply , driven by gaussian thermostats with negative friction or driven by gaussian white noise .",
    "the homogeneous cooling laws in these systems are described by the granular temperature @xmath497 , with a long time decay as @xmath498 or @xmath499 $ ] , where @xmath256 is the external ( laboratory ) time , and @xmath294 is the internal time or collision counter , and @xmath287 is proportional to the inelasticity @xmath299 .",
    "an interesting feature of all irs - models is that their scaling forms generically have a stretched gaussian high energy tail , @xmath500 $ ] . in _ freely cooling _",
    "irs - models with @xmath12 the stretching exponent @xmath11 satisfies @xmath501 . among the irs - models at the stability threshold only the freely cooling maxwell model has been analyzed in the present paper , and it does yield power law tails , @xmath374 , and the exponent @xmath16 has been calculated from a transcendental equation . in the irs - models with @xmath12 , driven by white noise , there exist again stretched gaussian tails with @xmath502 . all known results for higher dimensional inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath4 ) and inelastic maxwell models ( @xmath3 ) are recovered in the present analysis .    in irs - models with positive @xmath2 the tails are always stretched gaussians , and they are determined only by the loss term in the boltzmann equation . in the freely cooling maxwell model , and more generally at a stability threshold  which are the cases leading to power law tails @xcite  the loss and gain term in the nonlinear boltzmann equation are of comparable size , and partially balancing each other .",
    "we also have analyzed in section 2 an inelastic bgk model , introduced by brey et al @xcite , and generalized it to an energy dependent collision frequency , and we added energy source terms to this kinetic equation as well . in all cases",
    "the scaling solution can be calculated exactly .",
    "the freely cooling model shows an algebraic tail , @xmath197 with an exponent @xmath503 . for white noise driving one",
    "finds asymptotically @xmath504 $ ] with @xmath505 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the overpopulated high energy tails in the inelastic bgk - models , both for free cooling as well as for white noise driving , are essentially the same as for the more complicated maxwell models .",
    "however , the present extension to an energy dependent collision frequency does not capture the generic features of the less - singular stretched gaussian tails for the irs - models with @xmath12 , as predicted by the nonlinear boltzmann equation for these models .",
