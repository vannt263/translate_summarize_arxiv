    "@xcite , cherny and obloj @xcite , and zhang et al .",

    "however , the distributional study of ruin quantities in de finetti s dividend problem can be transformed to the study of drawdown quantities for the underlying surplus process ; see kyprianou and palmowski @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",

    "the distributional study of drawdown quantities is not only of theoretical interest , but also plays a fundamental role in the aforementioned applications .",

    "@xcite , zhang and hadjiliadis @xcite , and zhang @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , lvy processes and time - homogeneous diffusion processes are two main classes of markov processes for which various drawdown problems have been extensively studied .",
    "the treatment of these two classes of markov processes has typically been considered distinctly in the literature . for lvy processes ,",
    "it s excursion theory is a powerful approach to handle drawdown problems ( e.g. , avram et al .",
    "@xcite , pistorius @xcite , and mijatovic and pistorius @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite , and zhang @xcite ) . here",
    "again , lehoczky s approach relies on the continuity of the sample path of the underlying model , and hence is not applicable for processes with upward jumps .",

    "the joint law is expressed as the solution to an integral equation which involves two - sided exit quantities of the underlying process @xmath4 .",
    "the uniqueness of the integral equation for the joint law is also investigated . in particular",
    ", the joint law possesses explicit forms when @xmath4 has only one - sided jumps or is a lvy process ( possibly with two - sided jumps ) . in general , our main result reduces the drawdown problem to fundamental two - sided exit quantities",
    ".    the main idea of our proposed approach is briefly summarized below . by analyzing the evolution of sample paths over a short time period following time @xmath27 and using renewal arguments",
    ", we first establish tight upper and lower bounds for the joint law of @xmath26 in terms of the two - sided exit quantities . then",
    ", under mild regularity conditions , we use a fatou s lemma with varying measures to show that the upper and lower bounds converge when the length of the time interval approaches @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to an integro - differential equation satisfied by the desired joint law .",
    "finally , we reduce the integro - differential equation to an integral equation .",
    "when @xmath4 is a spectrally negative markov process or a general lvy process , the integral equation can be solved and the joint law of @xmath26 is hence explicitly expressed in terms of two - sided exit quantities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
