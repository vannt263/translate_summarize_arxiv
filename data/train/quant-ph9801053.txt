    "during the last years different kinds of systems for the generation of squeezed light have been proposed and realized .",
    "the bistable device obtained by placing a non - linear kerr medium inside an optical cavity is one of them .",
    "when the bistability turning point is approached , the fluctuations in one of the field quadratures of the incoming beam are reduced below shot noise @xcite .",
    "nearly perfect squeezing is expected when the non - linear medium is a lossless kerr medium @xcite . squeezing via the optical kerr effect was experimentally demonstrated at the output of a bistable cavity containing an atomic beam@xcite or a cloud of cold atoms released from a magneto - optical trap @xcite .",
    "most theoretical treatments have simplified the description of the field - matter interaction by modeling the laser beam as a plane - wave [ 1 - 7 ] .",
    "thanks to these works , the squeezing mechanism in this system is well understood and it has been shown that this kind of device has the potential to generate very large squeezing .",
    "there is now a need for more complete models , either to analyze experimental results of current experiments or to estimate the limitations of future set - ups . for more realistic systems",
    "it is clear that the plane wave description has to be modified to account for the spatial structure of the laser beam .",
    "when dealing with a non - linear medium made of atoms , a first step consists in averaging the mean field as well as the fluctuations over the beam profile in order to take into account the differences of light intensity and of coupling strength at different localizations inside the beam @xcite .",
    "this leads to a modification of the bistability curve and of the squeezing obtainable with the device . only in the limit of an ideal kerr medium ( characterized by a @xmath0 susceptibility )",
    "this single transverse mode approach leads to results identical to the plane wave model @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the interaction of a light beam with a non - linear medium gives rise to transverse spatial effects which may have a strong influence on the quantum fluctuations of the beam @xcite . for a kerr medium ,",
    "the first effects of the non - linearity ( before the appearance of spatial instabilities ) are self focusing or self defocusing .",
    "when dealing with a medium inside an optical cavity , these effects produce a coupling between different transverse modes , which depends on the intracavity intensity and changes not only the mean field but also field fluctuations . in particular the non - linear coupling produces an excess noise which is appreciable even if the cavity is perfectly matched to the spatial structure of the input beam .",
    "the existence of this coupling is of course well known , and most of the time cavities are designed to avoid a degeneration between a transverse mode and the fundamental mode of the cavity .",
    "single mode operation is thus achieved . however , as we will show in this paper , transverse modes have to be taken into account even for an input mode which is perfectly matched to the fundamental mode of a nondegenerate cavity",
    ". we will evaluate their effect on the quantum noise reduction and show that they can constitute a limiting factor for squeezing obtainable in the fundamental mode .",
    "we study in particular the influence of higher order transverse cavity modes on optical bistabilty and on different kinds of quantum noise reduction .",
    "the calculations are based on a linear input - output formalism where fluctuations are linearized around the working point of the system @xcite .",
    "we describe the spatial beam structure in terms of gauss - laguerre modes .",
    "the effect of the kerr non - linearity is then a coupling between the transverse modes . in section",
    "ii , we derive the coupling coefficients between the modes for a light beam propagating through a thin kerr medium . to present our approach",
    "we study in section iii the propagation through a thin medium in free space .",
    "the modes coupling is at the origin of non - linear losses for the fundamental mode .",
    "we show that the fluctuations associated to these losses are not vacuum fluctuations but correspond to phase conjugated noise . in section",
    "iv we consider a kerr medium inside an optical cavity .",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the excess noise produced in the fundamental mode through the coupling to higher order modes . in free space , this excess noise",
    "can not be neglected since its strength is of the same order of magnitude than the strength of the parametric noise modification . however",
    ", if the kerr medium is placed in a cavity , the cavity provides a mode selection which can lead to an important reduction of the perturbing effect of higher order transverses modes on the fundamental mode .",
    "when the cavity is non degenerate and the transverse mode spacing is large compared to the cavity width , one can perform a perturbative treatment in order to evaluate the influence of transverse mode coupling on the fundamental cavity mode .",
    "the fundamental mode may also accidentally coincide with a higher order mode corresponding to an other longitudinal mode family . in this case",
    ", one can calculate steady state and fluctuations by performing a two mode approximation described in the second part of section iv .",
    "the analysis of transverse mode coupling will finally enable us to estimate the validity limit of a single mode approximation .",
    "the discussion of the results as well as some conclusive remarks will be presented in section v. details of the calculations are exposed in the appendix .",

    "the parametric term may be readily obtained by differentiating equation ( [ a0 ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to the usual parametric change of quantum fluctuations and is obtained similarly in the single mode approximation .",
    "the additional fluctuations can be understood as a consequence of the losses experienced by the fundamental mode due to its coupling to higher order modes .",
    "they correspond mainly to phase conjugated noise .",
    "indeed in first order , they may be written as : @xmath62 their correlation function @xmath63 is characteristic of the mode coupling by the kerr medium and we will find it again in the following . notice that even for small non - linearities this additional noise is never negligible .",
    "we come now to the case where the non - linear medium is not in free space but placed inside an optical cavity . we will consider the input field to be perfectly matched to the fundamental gaussian mode of the cavity ( @xmath64 for the input beam ) .",
    "inside the cavity higher order transverse modes become important due to non - linear coupling . however , because of the cylindrical symmetry of the problem , we do not have to consider higher order modes with non - circular symmetry ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the cavity is supposed to be single ended , with an input mirror of amplitude transmissivity @xmath66 . in the limit of a high finesse cavity it is possible to derive an evolution equation for the intracavity field amplitude by evaluating the modification of the field during one roundtrip .",
    "the roundtrip propagation of the transverse mode @xmath67 gives rise to a phase shift @xmath68 which is the sum of the detuning @xmath69 of the fundamental mode and integer multiple of the longitudinal phase spacing @xmath70 and the transverse phase spacing @xmath71 between different transverse modes . in a first approach",
    ", we will suppose the spacing between longitudinal modes to be much larger than @xmath71 . in this limit , only one family of modes corresponding a longitudinal index @xmath72 has to be considered .",
    "this assumption will be given up in the last section , where we will consider also the influence of different longitudinal cavity modes .",
    "compared to the case of field propagation through a non - linear medium placed in free space , the field evolution equation inside the cavity has now to contain additional terms which take into account losses of the intracavity field as well as transmission of the input field through the cavity coupling mirror : @xmath73 @xmath74 is the roundtrip time of the field inside the cavity . in the last term",
    "one recognizes the field modification due to the presence of the kerr medium . for an empty cavity at resonance ,",
    "the mean amplitude of the fundamental mode is @xmath75 where the mean amplitude of the fundamental mode is @xmath76 .",
    "we can then define normalized mode amplitudes @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively for the intracavity , input and output fields .",
    "they obey a dimensionless evolution equation @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a dimensionless time , @xmath82 is the normalized phase shift of mode @xmath43 and @xmath83 the normalized non - linear coupling coefficient .",
    "the output field is given as a sum of the reflected input field and the transmitted intracavity field : @xmath84 in a single mode approximation , the intracavity intensity exhibits bistable behaviour because of the intensity dependent phase shift .",
    "this phenomenon occurs as soon as the non - linear phase shift @xmath85 of the field is of the same order than the cavity width @xmath86 .",

    "although we consider an input field which is spatially matched to the fundamental cavity mode , we nevertheless have to take into account fluctuations entering the cavity through all possible input modes .",
    "the output fluctuations can be deduced from @xmath91 we have denoted here @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 the fluctuations of the normalized amplitudes @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "as mentioned in the beginning of this section we will first consider the case where the transverse mode spacing is large compared to the cavity bandwidth .",
    "( @xmath98 ) . hence",
    ", when the fundamental mode is nearly resonant , higher order transverse modes are far off resonance and their amplitudes will be small compared to the amplitude of the fundamental mode .",
    "this situation allows one to adopt a perturbative treatment of the coupling between fundamental and higher order modes , where the latter enter as first order quantities .",

    "the first bracket gives the loss in the fundamental mode due to energy transfer to higher order modes .",
    "the last three terms in the second bracket describe the non - linear phase shift of the fundamental mode by the presence of higher order modes .",
    "energy transfer and phase shift arise as soon as higher order transverse modes exist , but they are the smaller the more distant the perturbing transverse modes are from a cavity resonance .",
    "however , they increase with increasing intensity in the fundamental mode . at lowest order ,",
    "their expressions are given by @xmath102 by comparing this relation to the free space situation ( cf . equation ( [ freeloss ] ) ) , one notices that the relations depend now on the cavity width @xmath86 as well as on the transverse mode spacing @xmath103 . in general",
    "the cavity may therefore suppress or enhance the non - linear losses depending on whether the fundamental mode and higher order modes are degenerate or not .",
    "for the non degenerate cavity that we consider here the cavity reduces the non - linear losses considerably .",

    "one can now analyze perturbatively the intracavity fluctuations of higher order modes .",
    "we present the detailed calculation in the appendix ( [ app2 ] ) where we give in particular the results for non - linear phase shifts and losses as well as for the transfer function . here",
    "we will concentrate on the calculation and discussion of the physically more interesting quantity , the fluctuations in the output beam .",
    "we might first rewrite the intracavity fluctuations in a more compact form as the sum of two contributions , one coming from the input fluctuations the other from non - linear coupling : @xmath122 the fluctuations in the output beam may now be calculated with the help of expression ( [ alphaout ] ) : @xmath123 their correlation function is found to split into the same distinct parts , the input noise which is transformed by the cavity and the added noise due to non - linear coupling : @xmath124 the propagator @xmath125 of fluctuations in the fundamental mode is uniquely determined by the matrix @xmath126 given in the appendix ( [ app2 ] ) .",

    "we have considered only one longitudinal mode and assumed the corresponding fundamental mode and transverse modes to be non degenerate .",
    "however , complications might arise when a transverse mode corresponding to a different longitudinal mode coincides with the fundamental mode of the cavity . in that case",
    "we expect important changes in the mean intracavity intensity as well as in the quantum fluctuations of the fundamental mode .",

    "different bistability curves correspond to different transverse mode orders @xmath43 .",
    "the relative linear detuning between the fundamental mode and the transverse mode is here chosen to be zero .",
    "as soon as the mode order is larger than 4 , the modification of the intracavity intensity of the fundamental mode due to non - linear coupling with the transverse mode becomes negligible compared to the single mode approximation ( dashed line ) .",

    "figure 3 shows the optimum noise reduction in the fundamental mode as a function of the dimensionless frequency @xmath108 .",

    "clearly , the effect of different non - linear coupling compared to the single mode approximation ( dashed line ) is a reduction and even suppression of the squeezing in the fundamental mode due to added    noise coming from the perturbing mode , even though the spatial structure of the fundamental mode is perfectly matched to a cavity mode .",
    "it has to be noticed that this perturbation is higher than what would have been expected from the examination of the bistability curves : for the mode @xmath158 , the steady state ( figure 1(e ) ) is almost the steady state of the single mode cavity and only a small fraction of the incoming photons is transferred to the second mode .",

    "the squeezing at    zero frequency is here almost perfect .",
    "this result has to be seen in comparison with figure 3 where we had shown the optimum squeezing in the output beam for the same experimental parameters but measured with a local oscillator the spatial structure of which was not optimized .",
    "it can also be noticed that here the noise reductions obtained for a coupling with different transverse modes show little differences .",
    "this can be understood from the squeezing mechanism .",
    "the bistability turning point is a critical point at which fluctuations in one of the field quadratures diverge . since the system is lossless , fluctuations in the conjugated field quadrature have to tend to zero when the turning point is reached .",
    "compared to quadrature squeezing the influence of non - linear coupling on intensity squeezing is very differ-    ent .",
    "figure 6 shows a comparison of the attainable intensity squeezing for a coupling to various modes .",
    "clearly , this squeezing is very robust against the mode coupling .",
    "furthermore the curves for various modes show little differences .",
    "as expected from the squeezing by a lossless medium the noise at zero frequency is not modified since the total photon number is conserved .",
    "it also has to be noticed that for a coupling with mode @xmath160 , the energy transfer from the fundamental mode to the transverse mode is not negligible . as a consequence",
    "the spatial structure of the beam going out of the cavity is quite different from the fundamental mode .",
    "its intensity fluctuations are nevertheless reduced and this reduction corresponds to the one that could be expected from the single mode situation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the non - linear coupling between transverse modes in a kerr medium and its effect on bistability and quantum noise if the medium is placed inside a cavity .",
    "whereas in free space the non - linear coupling becomes important as soon as the non - linear phase shift is appreciable , the use of an optical cavity can reduce significantly the perturbing effect of the transverse modes by selecting only a few modes .",
    "when fundamental and higher order modes belong to the same longitudinal mode family and only the fundamental mode is resonant , it is possible to treat higher order transverse modes perturbatively .",
    "the non - linear coupling leads to losses for the fundamental mode associated with an excess noise which contains a contribution from phase conjugated noise .",
    "the non - linear loss scales with the inverse of transverse mode spacing .",
    "perturbations due to higher order transverse modes can therefore be neglected as soon as the transverse mode spacing becomes large compared to the cavity width . in this case",
    "a single mode approximation is valid .    in an experiment",
    "the fundamental mode may accidentally coincide with a transverse mode corresponding to a different longitudinal mode family . in this case",
    ", one can perform the calculations in a two mode approximation .",
    "we have shown that even if the spatial structure of the input beam is perfectly adapted to the fundamental mode of the cavity , the non - linear coupling produces an excess noise in the fluctuations of the fundamental mode and therefore can limit the optimum squeezing .",
    "the perturbation always arises when low order modes ( @xmath161 ) coincide resonantly with the fundamental mode during the resonance scan of the cavity .",
    "the reduction or even suppression of the obtainable squeezing occurs then in the central part of the noise spectrum .",
    "quadrature squeezing in the fundamental mode is thus sensitive on perturbations by higher order modes .",
    "however , it is possible to recover the optimum squeezing in the output beam if the spatial structure of the local oscillator is optimized .",
    "fluctuations are then not measured in the fundamental mode but in a mode corresponding to a linear superposition of the fundamental and the perturbing mode .",
    "in contrast to quadrature squeezing quantum noise reduction in the total output intensity of the fundamental mode turns out to be very robust to perturbations by higher order modes .",
    "hence , a kerr medium inside an optical cavity remains a good intensity `` noise eater '' even when taking into account higher order transverse modes .",
