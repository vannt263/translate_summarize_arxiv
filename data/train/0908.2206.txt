    "in this note we derive stretched exponential bounds on the connectivity function for the vacant set of random interlacements on @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the model of random interlacements has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "it heuristically describes the microscopic structure left in the bulk by random walk on a cylinder with base a large @xmath7-dimensional discrete torus , or by random walk on a large @xmath8-dimensional torus , when the walk respectively runs for times proportional to the square of the number of sites in the base , or to the number of sites in the torus , cf .",

    "further extensions to more general graphs can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the bounds presented here pertain to a very specific region of the non - percolative regime of the vacant set of random interlacements . knowing whether this region actually coincides with the whole non - percolative regime outside the critical point is an important question with direct implications for the asymptotic behavior of the disconnection time of discrete cylinders with bases which become large , cf .",
    "the results in the present note do not answer this question , but they indicate that in the case where the two regions differ , there is a marked transition in the decay properties of the connectivity function ( roughly from a polynomial to a stretched exponential decay ) , as one moves across another ( and then distinct ) critical point , which has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will now describe the model and state our main result .",
    "we refer to section 1 for precise definitions .",
    "random interlacements consists of a cloud of paths which constitute a poisson point process on the space of doubly infinite @xmath0-valued trajectories modulo time - shift , tending to infinity at positive and negative infinite times .",
