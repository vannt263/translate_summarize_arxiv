    "analysis of structures far from equilibrium and their evolution has necessitated the development and implementation of several new techniques  @xcite .",
    "the underlying physical systems are dissipative and typically exhibit sensitive dependence on initial states  @xcite ; i.e. , differences between nearly identical patterns increase in time .",
    "further , although structures formed from distinct initial states differ in detail , they appear to share features that depend only on control parameters of the physical system .",
    "these observations led prigogine and collaborators to propose the use of irreversible statistical analysis using ensembles of solutions of a system  @xcite .",
    "however , it is a non - trivial task to identify measures appropriate to analyze a given class of structures .",
    "we consider properties of large aspect ratio patterns that are formed via spontaneous symmetry breaking from a noisy , but otherwise structureless initial state .",
    "patterns are generated when an external control parameter crosses a threshold , initiating a local bifurcation to a periodic array ; these arrays are typically , striped , square , triangular or hexagonal  @xcite .",
    "however , due to translational and rotational invariances of the underlying system , the location and orientation of these local patches are not synchronized over the entire domain . as they grow",
    ", these patches compete with each other to produce complex patterns seen in experimental and model systems  @xcite , see figures  [ snapshot0 ] , [ snapshot_exp ] and [ snapshot ] .",
    "these structures , whose details are sensitively dependent on the initial state , can be considered to belong to the ensemble of patterns .",
    "assume that such a spatio - temporal pattern can be represented by a scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "several functionals of @xmath2 have been proposed as measures to be used in statistical descriptions .",
    "most of these are modeled on related quantities from equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the width of the structure factor @xmath3  @xcite ( i.e. , the width of the peak in the azimuthal average of @xmath4 is one of the more frequently studied examples .",
    "it has been shown that the evolution of a pattern from a noisy initial state consists of two distinct stages  @xcite : @xmath5 is obeyed until the peak amplitude of the field @xmath2 saturates , beyond which time the pattern coarsens and the decay becomes slower .",
    "for the swift - hohenberg equation , elder et al .",
    "@xcite , cross and meiron  @xcite , and hou et al .",
    "@xcite found that during this second stage @xmath3 decreased as @xmath6 when the dynamics was noise free and at a faster rate @xmath7 otherwise .",
    "additional quantities have been introduced to describe the second relaxation region .",
    "hou et al .",
    "@xcite measured cumulative domain wall length as a function of time . for noise - free ( resp .",
    "noisy ) dynamics , it was shown to decay as @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) .",
    "cross et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a stripe orientation correlation field decayed as @xmath9 .",
    "notice that in the second relaxation stage , distinct measures ( which probe multiple features of a pattern ) decay at different rates .",
    "a systematic way to study such variations is to define a field to quantify the  local \" disorder , and to use multiple moments of this field to construct a family of characteristics to describe the dynamics of various lengthscales associated with the pattern  @xcite .",
    "such a class appropriate for labyrinthine patterns , referred to as the disorder function , has been introduced  @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath10 { \\bigg/ } k^{2\\beta } , \\label{defn}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the wavevector associated with the local planform , @xmath12 denotes the mean of @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the area of the pattern , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) has been normalized to be scale invariant . in this definition ,",
    "the field used to quantify the local disorder is the magnitude @xmath17 of the helmholtz operator .",
    "the integrand is non - zero at locations where the local wave - number deviates from its global mean @xmath18 , and those where the planforms are curved .",
    "( the latter can be seen by considering a region of stripes with a radius of curvature @xmath19 ; i.e. , @xmath20 . there",
    "@xmath21 . )",
    "distinct `` moments '' @xmath22 can be used to emphasize particular features of a pattern ; for example , large values of @xmath22 provide a higher weight to defects  @xcite .",
    "methods to calculate @xmath15 for ( noisy ) experimental patterns have been introduced  @xcite . in this paper , we will describe spatio - temporal dynamics using @xmath23 . as can be easily seen , for each @xmath22 , @xmath24 is the ratio of a wave number associated with the moment @xmath22 of the helmholtz operator and @xmath18 .",
    "the disorder function analysis of the evolution of patterns under model spatio - temporal dynamics from an initially noisy state reveals the presence of two stages  @xcite , consistent with the analysis of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "it is found that during the first stage spatio - temporal dynamics is essentially linear , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a universal exponent  @xcite .",
    "thus , the wave number associated with each moment @xmath22 reduces at a rate @xmath27 , and the corresponding lengthscale grows as @xmath28 .",
    "the second stage , domain - coarsening , exhibits more complex behavior .",
    "the relaxation is described by @xmath29  @xcite . unlike @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath31 is model dependent ; i.e. , the corresponding relaxation is not universal , and wave numbers associated with multiple moments decay with rates that depend on @xmath22 .",
    "these conclusions were recently validated in a set of experiments on pattern formation in a vibrated layer of brass beads  @xcite .",
    "however , the experiments showed , in addition , that for very long times the patterns reach a third stage ; here , the indices @xmath32 are independent of @xmath22 , but their common value is not universal . the work reported in this paper shows that the presence of this final stage in systems far from the onset of patterns is one observable consequence of stochasticity in the underlying spatio - temporal dynamics .",
    "the results complement recent demonstrations on effects of noise in systems close to the onset of patterns  @xcite .",
    "the model system used in our studies is an extension of the swift - hohenberg equation  @xcite , which describes the dynamics of a scalar field @xmath1 via @xmath33 @xmath34 sets the rate of diffusion , @xmath35 is the distance from pattern onset , @xmath36 is the strength of a non - variational term  @xcite , and @xmath11 is the wave number of the underlying planform .",
    "@xmath37 is a stochastic term such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the strength of the noise ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent stochastic and noise - free spatio - temporal dynamics . for suitable control parameters , random initial states (",

    "several snapshots from such an evolution under noise - free dynamics are shown in figure  [ snapshot0 ] @xcite .",

    "i , @xmath44 is significantly smaller than its value at large times ; hence , spatio - temporal dynamics can be approximated by the linear partial differential equation @xmath45 the fourier transform of @xmath1 satisfies @xmath46 for a given noisy initial state , this solution can be used to evaluate integrals in eqn .",

    "results shown in figure  [ delta ] can be used to compute @xmath52 . at a given time @xmath48",
    ", we use the five nearest points ( @xmath48 and the closest two points on both sides ) to calculate the slope of the curves @xmath53 vs. @xmath54 using a least squares fit . as shown in figure  [ sigma0 ] , this analysis confirms that @xmath55 during stage i.    the onset of stage ii coincides with the saturation of the peak value of the field @xmath2 and beyond this time the relaxation of @xmath56 is slower .",
    "further , as seen from figure  [ sigma0 ] , @xmath57 varies both with @xmath48 and @xmath22 .",
    "the variation with @xmath22 implies that the wave numbers associated with @xmath24 decay at rates which depend on @xmath22 ; i.e. , lengthscales associated with multiple features of these patterns grow at different rates  @xcite .",
    "the spatio - temporal dynamics shown in figure  [ snapshot0 ] retains this feature even for very large times , when the pattern consists of a few large domains .",
    "typically , @xmath58 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath22 during stage ii ; thus , the mean distance between defects ( @xmath59  @xcite ) grows at a slower rate than ( for example ) the mean curvature or domain size .",
    "exceptions occur during the removal of defect(s ) or small domains from a pattern .",
    "these events can be identified by a sudden rapid decrease in @xmath60 , an example of which is seen near @xmath61 in figure  [ delta ] .",
    "figure  [ defects ] shows the pattern prior to and following the absorption of a small domain into a larger one .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath62 and @xmath58 during this metamorphosis is shown in figure  [ delta_def](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath58 which is monotonic before and after the change takes on a more complex form during the transition .",
    "this method can be used to identify domain disappearance even when it is difficult to recognize the change visually ( as often happens in patterns with a large number of domains ) .",
    "the pattern forming experiments were conducted with 0.165 mm bronze spheres contained in a vertically oscillated circular container with a diameter of 140 mm  @xcite .",
    "the layer is four particle diameters deep , and the cell is evacuated to 4 pa so that hydrodynamic interaction between the grains and surrounding gas is negligible .",
    "the control parameters are the frequency @xmath63 of the sinusoidal oscillations and the peak acceleration of the container relative to gravity , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the amplitude of the oscillation and @xmath66 is the gravitational acceleration . as @xmath63 and @xmath67",
    "are changed , a variety of temporally subharmonic patterns including locally square , striped , or hexagonal patterns are observed  @xcite .",
    "the textures analyzed consisted of patterns with square planforms  @xcite .",
    "the granular surface is visualized by illuminating the cell using a ring of leds surrounding the cell and is strobed at the drive frequency of the container .",
    "the light is incident at low angles and the scattering intensity is a nonlinear function of the height of the layer ; scattering from peaks ( valleys ) creates bright ( dark ) regions.this intensity field is used to represent the structures  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ snapshot_exp ] shows four snapshots during the evolution of an experimental pattern , and figure  [ delta_exp ] shows the corresponding behavior of @xmath43 .",
    "stages i and ii , analogous to those seen in patterns of the model system , can be observed .",
    "it was confirmed that the onset of stage ii corresponded to the saturation of the peak amplitude  @xcite . using the leftmost interval shown in figure  [ delta_exp ] , the evolution during stage i was shown to be consistent with @xmath68 , although there were insufficient data points for the result to be conclusive  @xcite . beyond this stage ,",
    "the relaxation was much slower , and @xmath58 depends on @xmath22  @xcite , see figure  [ expt ] .",
    "however , it was observed that at much longer times ( e.g. , during the rightmost interval in figure  [ delta_exp ] ) the patterns reach a stage where @xmath58 is independent of @xmath22 , and its value is not the universal 1/2 of the first stage , see figure  [ expt ] .",
    "behavior analogous to stage iii in experimental patterns is not observed in the spatio - temporal dynamics such as that shown in figure  [ snapshot0 ] , even at very large times when the pattern consists of a few domains . clearly , one or more ingredients that are necessary for the description is missing from the model we have used .",
    "candidates include non - variational terms , finite size effects and stochastic terms .",
    "in particular , only finite subdomains of the experimental system are analyzed ( in contrast the model system has periodic boundary conditions ) , and stochasticity has been shown to play a role in the dynamics near the onset of patterns  @xcite .",
    "integration of the model system shows that neither the addition of non - variational terms ( @xmath69 ) to the spatio - temporal dynamics nor conducting the analysis on smaller sub - domains give a transition away from stage ii , even at very large times . on the other hand , we find that the addition of stochastic terms does lead to such a transition , and that the new stage has characteristics described in the last section .",
    "figure  [ snapshot ] shows four snapshots during the development of such a structure under the swift - hohenberg equation with stochastic terms ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath42 is qualitatively similar to figure  [ delta ] .",
    "the principal difference that can be gleaned from the analysis of a single moment @xmath15 is an increase in the decay rate , particularly in stage ii .",
    "@xmath52 exhibits features that are similar to the corresponding noise - free dynamics ; it is independent of @xmath22 in stage i , but is a function of @xmath22 following saturation of the field @xmath2 .",
    "however , at very large times , @xmath52 is once again seen to be independent of @xmath22 , taking a value that depends on control parameters , see figure  [ sigma ] .",
    "it is also found that the onset of stage iii advances with increasing intensity of the stochastic terms .",
    "for sufficiently large values of @xmath39 the dynamics can move directly from stage i to iii .",
    "the implication of the @xmath22 independence of @xmath71 is that all lengthscales associated with the pattern grow at the same rate during stage iii .",
    "this assertion can be tested by studying the relaxation of the width of the structure factor and the defect density . for the analysis , we used averages for four nominally identical runs with parameters given in figure  [ snapshot ] . the mean decay rate of the width of the structure factor at time @xmath72 of figure  [ sigma ] is found to be @xmath73 , in agreement with @xmath74 .",
    "secondly , the mean number of defects at @xmath72 ( xx how was this calculated ? ) is found to decrease like @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "the associated lengthscale ( i.e. , the mean distance between defects ) grows with an index @xmath77 , once again consistent with the value of @xmath74 .",
    "we set out to compare and contrast pattern dynamics in distinct systems .",
    "it is important to note that such a task can only be achieved using  configuration independent \" characteristics ; i.e. , measures that depend on control parameters of the underlying system , and not on the ( random ) initial states . for complex patterns with local planforms such as stripes , squares or hexagons ( e.g. ,",
    "figures  [ snapshot0 ] , [ snapshot_exp ] and [ snapshot ] ) , such measures include the width of the structure factor  @xcite , defect density  @xcite , length of domain boundaries  @xcite , and the disorder function  @xcite .",
    "analysis of patterns generated in the swift - hohenberg equation and on a vibrated layer of brass beads show that during early times all components of the disorder function relax as @xmath78 .",
    "we showed that the index can be obtained by noting that during this stage the intensity of the field representing the pattern is sufficiently small and hence the spatio - temporal dynamics can be considered to be linear .",
    "the saturation of the field is followed , in each case , by a second stage where the relaxation is non - universal and the growth indices @xmath58 are @xmath22 dependent ; the latter implies that the growth of distinct features of patterns occur at different rates .",
    "experimental patterns exhibit a third stage at times very long compared to the vibrational period of the container  @xcite , where @xmath58 is once again independent of @xmath22 .",
    "it is not possible to differentiate it from stage ii by analyzing the behavior of a single index ; rather , it requires the use of the entire family of indices @xmath52 . unlike in stage",
    "i , the value of @xmath58 is not universal .",
    "stage iii is not present in spatio - temporal dynamics under the non - stochastic swift - hohenberg equation , even when non - variational terms and finite - size effects are included .",
    "our work suggests that the ingredient required to initiate stage iii is stochasticity of the underlying spatio - temporal dynamics .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath60 was constructed to quantify disorder in patterns that consist of local planforms which satisfy the helmholtz equation  @xcite .",
