    "various models have been proposed to describe the present acceleration of the universe , which is confirmed by analyzing different astrophysical data @xcite .",
    "these models can be roughly classified into two classes : i ) considering extra terms in the einstein equations through the cosmological constant or exotic matter with negative pressure such as the quintessence scalar field .",
    "ii ) modifying the einstein theory of gravity such that at large scale the required negative pressure is provided .",
    "the `` teleparallel '' model of general relativity is one of these models in which one uses the curvatureless weitzenbock connection instead of the usual levi - civita torsionless connections @xcite . in this",
    "context vierbeins are considered dynamical fields .",
    "the study of universe acceleration in this framework has been the subject of many papers in recent years @xcite .",
    "there is some similarity between this model and elko @xcite dark energy model which may be related to the relation between the torsion and spinors .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another problem concerning dark energy models is the coincidence problem which states why nowadays the order of dark matter and dark energy densities , despite their different evolutions are the same .",
    "this may be restated as why the dark energy density was so small and negligible at the earlier epochs .",
    "in this paper we consider a spatially flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , and try to study the onset of acceleration in the framework of teleparallel gravity via the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we also take a look at the coincidence problem . to this end , we establish our model such that the scalar field is initially settled down at the minimum of its potential which we take to be zero . indeed , the scalar field potential is assumed to have a @xmath0 symmetry with a zero minimum value . an interaction source between dark matter and dark energy",
    "is required to hold the scalar field at this minimum . as the nature of dark matter and dark energy",
    "has not yet been clarified ( and as it is customary in the literature ) , we consider the interaction only between dark sectors and do not consider nongravitational interaction between baryonic matter and dark sectors and so evade local gravitational tests .    in this way dark energy",
    "does not contribute in the total energy density of the universe at earlier eras .",
    "but , if we want to relate onset of acceleration to symmetry breaking , this procedure produces a problem in the minimal case : in the minimal case where the friedmann equations have the same form as the usual general relativity , the acceleration can not occur in a scalar field model with negative potential @xcite .",
    "so if initially the potential is zero , as the symmetry breaking reduces the value of the potential , the acceleration will not happen in this model @xcite .",
    "this was our motivation to consider a coupling between dark energy and scalar torsion and construct a non minimally coupled model .",
    "although teleparallel model of gravity with a non - minimally coupled scalar field to the scalar torsion has been mostly used in flrw cosmology to study the present acceleration of the universe , but it was also the subject of study in other situations : the post - newtonian limit of this model was discussed in @xcite and it was shown that the model is compatible with solar system observations . as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "this feature is quite different from the usual scalar - tensor theories which require strict conditions on the parameter space to become consistent with the solar system tests .",
    "spherically symmetric structures supported by this model has also been the subject of some studies : in @xcite , non - minimally coupled scalar field in the teleparallel framework was used to introduce a new class of boson stars with some novel characteristics .",
    "asymptotically ads hairy black hole solutions in three dimensions and in the context of teleparallel gravity were studied in @xcite .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions for models in which the scalar field is non - minimally coupled to the scalar torsion via a derivative coupling , was studied in @xcite , where a new class of wormhole - like solutions was presented .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the second section we introduce the teleparallel model with two couplings : the coupling of the scalar field to the torsion scalar and the coupling of dark matter to dark energy . for the latter , beside the phenomenological method",
    ", we present a possible framework based on an action . in the third section",
    "we explain how these couplings hold the scalar field at the minimum of the effective potential at early and late times .",
    "finally , we discuss the stability of the model in the fourth section .",
    "we use units @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a universe filled with dark energy scalar field , @xmath2 , and pressureless dark and baryonic matters in the context of teleparallel model of gravity .",
    "this model is described by the action @xcite @xmath3 @xmath4 indicates the contribution of baryonic and cold dark matters . in terms of the vierbeins , the metric tensor may be expressed as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the torsion scalar @xmath10 in which @xmath11 .",
    "variation of ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to @xmath12 gives the equations of motion @xmath13 @xmath14 is defined through @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to @xmath4 ( not to be confused with the total energy momentum tensor ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lagrangian density associated to pressureless baryonic and dark matters .    to study the cosmological aspects of the model",
    ", we consider a spatially flat flrw space - time @xmath19 for which @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the scale factor .",
    "the hubble parameter is @xmath22 . for a homogeneous scalar field @xmath23 , from ( [ 3 ] ) , we obtain the friedmann equations @xmath24 where baryonic and cold dark matter energy densities are introduced by @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .    by defining effective energy density and pressure for",
    "the scalar field dark energy as @xmath27 the friedmann equations take their usual forms @xmath28 variation of the action with respect to the scalar field gives @xmath29 therefore , from ( [ r2 ] ) one can see that the scalar field satisfies the continuity equation @xmath30 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy their own continuity equations , the total energy density , @xmath31 , satisfies @xmath32    as the nature of dark sectors has not yet been clarified , it is legitimate to consider ( possible ) interaction between them .",
    "this idea was first introduced to alleviate the coincidence problem , that is to explain why the order of magnitude of dark energy density is the same as that of dark matter , despite their different evolutions . in the minimal models in einstein s",
    "theory of gravity this procedure has been employed in the literature to transmit energy density from the scalar field to dark matter , but in our case as we will show , this interaction serves to hold the scalar field at the zero level of its energy in earlier eras .    following",
    "@xcite we consider an interaction between dark sectors , i. e. between the scalar field and cold dark matter , via the source @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the trace of the energy momentum tensor of dark matter .",
    "taking such an interaction ( as we reveal ) also has roots in brans - dicke models .",
    "general covariance implies that @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the energy momentum tensor of dark matter , quintessence , and baroynic matter respectively . for homogenous scalar field @xmath23 , ( [ r5 ] ) gives @xmath37 and @xmath38 _ note that we have not considered any non - gravitational interaction between dark sectors and baryonic matter , so relax any local gravitational constraints _ , therefore @xmath25 satisfies as usual @xmath39 whose solution is given by @xmath40 , where we take the present scale factor as @xmath41 .",
    "subscript @xmath42 denotes the value of a parameter at the present time .",
    "it is interesting to note that our chosen interaction may also be obtained from an action . to see this",
    ", we consider the action @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 matter component that is baryonic or dark matter , and @xmath46 is specified by the conformal transformation @xmath47 considering different conformal coupling for different species violates the weak equivalence principle but ( in the presence of not very well known components ) is customary in the literature , e.g. in the mass varying neutrino model @xcite , or in the model of variable gravity @xcite .",
    "for ordinary baryonic matter we take @xmath48 and for cold dark matter @xmath49 .",
    "the transformed metric in the _ dark matter _",
    "sector is then given by @xmath50 .",
    "using @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy momentum tensor in the tilde frame , variation of the action with respect to @xmath2 gives @xmath53 which for pressureless dark matter becomes @xmath54 to find this we used @xmath55 giving @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( [ r6 ] ) is the same as ( [ 9 ] ) provided that we take @xcite @xmath57    variation of the action with respect to the tetrad @xmath58 gives @xmath59 which , by substituting @xmath60 , yields our previous friedmann equations .",
    "therefore the equations of motion may be rederived via an action context .",
    "both approaches are phenomenological ( resulting interactions have not base in a fundamental theory ) although the second approach has roots in brans - decke theory of gravity @xcite,@xcite .",
    "hereinafter , we use a rescaled dark matter energy density , which is rather a mathematical object , defined by @xmath61 to simplify ( [ r6 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) as @xmath62 to derive ( [ 13 ] ) we used also @xmath63 which holds in flrw space - time .",
    "so @xmath2 evolves in an effective potential specified by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is simply given by @xmath66 .",
    "this simplicity will help us establish our model .",
    "note that the interaction between dark sectors does not enter in the friedmann equations explicitly , but modifies the continuity equations of dark components . in the following we use ( [ 13 ] ) and the friedmann equations ( [ 6 ] ) to study the positive acceleration of the universe .",
    "the second derivative of the scale factor , i. e. @xmath67 , has the same sign as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "so for @xmath70 we have an accelerated ( decelerated ) universe .",
    "we aim to establish a model where initially the scalar field was settled down at the zero minimum of its potential such that it had no contribution in the energy density of the universe .",
    "this is motivated by the coincidence problem which states why the dark matter and dark energy , despite their different evolutions have the same order today or in other words why the dark energy density was much smaller than dark matter at early times . besides , we require that the acceleration becomes positive in the present epoch . for our goal",
    "we try to use the symmetry breaking process .",
    "to do so we choose the well - known @xmath0 symmetric potential @xmath71 and consider @xcite @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 are positive constants .",
    "evenness of @xmath75 guarantees @xmath0 symmetry of the effective action .",
    "@xmath76 is assumed as an inverse mass squared scale such that @xmath77 .",
    "therefore terms containing higher power of @xmath2 are absent in the polynomial supposed in([20 ] ) .",
    "the chosen form for @xmath75 allows the symmetry breaking via the scale factor evolution .    to see how this model can express an initial matter dominated decelerated universe that precedes an acceleration phase arisen from the symmetry breaking ,",
    "let us write the equation of motion of the scalar field as @xmath78 where the effective potential is @xmath79 so we can define an effective mass by @xmath80 we assume that initially the field was settled down at the point @xmath81 which is the solution of the field equation and is the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "in this era @xmath82 and @xmath65 defined by ( [ r7 ] ) equals @xmath26 , hence @xmath83 and @xmath84 if @xmath85 then when matter densities are large enough ( @xmath86 is small enough ) , the squared of the effective mass term is positive and the shape of the effective potential is concave and @xmath81 is a stable point . to satisfy ( [ r8 ] ) for @xmath87 , we must have @xmath88 .",
    "based on these remarks , we can model our theory such that the field was settled down initially at the point @xmath81 which is the solution of ( [ 13 ] ) and also is the minimum of the effective potential . in this era",
    "the universe was matter dominated and was in deceleration phase @xmath89 so initially the dark energy did not contribute in the universe s ingredients : @xmath90 .",
    "the relative densities are defined through @xmath91 . in this era , the ratio of matter energy densities was a constant @xmath92 to derive the second equality , we used @xmath93 which holds when @xmath81 . during its evolution the scale factor increases and becomes greater than a critical value @xmath94 specified by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and subscript @xmath42 as before denotes the value of a parameter at the present era .",
    "when this happens , the squared of the effective mass becomes negative and the tachyonic scalar field leaves the previous vacuum , i. e. @xmath81 ( which is now the new local maximum of the effective potential ) , and rolls down towards the new stable vacuum of the system with a rate of order @xmath98 and the @xmath0 symmetry breaks .",
    "it is worth noting that in the minimal model @xmath99 , after the symmetry breaking the scalar field rolls down its potential and @xmath100 becomes negative forbidding the universe to accelerate ( see ( [ 18 ] ) ) .",
    "_ therefore @xmath101 is necessary for onset of acceleration_.    the minimum of the effective potential is derived from @xmath102 when the scale factor crosses the limit ( [ 27 ] ) , the scalar field rolls towards the minimum of the effective action and begins a damped oscillation around it and finally tends to @xmath103 specified by ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "using ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) we deduce that @xmath25 and @xmath65 are decreasing functions of time .",
    "hence , we expect that if @xmath104 tends to a non - zero constant , they approach zero at late time . whence we expect the following consistent solution for the system at late time @xmath105 which specifies a de sitter space time . for the minimal case @xmath99 , or the einstein theory of gravity we have @xmath106 which yields @xmath107 .",
    "thus solution ( [ 30 ] ) is not acceptable in the minimal case",
    ". for @xmath108 either @xmath109 or @xmath110 is negative so we restrict ourselves to @xmath87 .",
    "this reveals the importance of @xmath111 for initial vanishing of dark energy ( see the discussion after ( [ r8 ] ) ) .    the solution of ( [ 30 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath112 so after leaving the first vacuum @xmath81 , the scalar field goes towards the new minimum of the effective potential , begins a damped oscillation around it and eventually settles down at @xmath103 .",
    "to investigate the evolution of the system more precisely late time and to examine the stability condition for the fixed points we perform a dynamical phase analysis . by defining the variables @xmath113 , we find an autonomous system of differential equations @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "fixed points are obtained as @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 there exists also an additional condition coming from the friedmann equation @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "the deceleration parameter at the fixed points is @xmath125    after some computations , we find that at point ii , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "so we deduce @xmath128 and ( [ 37 ] ) leads to @xmath129 resulting in a deceleration phase .",
    "similarly for point iii , we obtain @xmath130 and @xmath131 resulting in @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 holds in this case too .",
    "so accompanied by iv , points ii and iii can be classified in a group describing a decelerated universe , @xmath132 , dominated by baryonic and dark matter .",
    "now consider point i. by equating @xmath103 with @xmath133 , we can derive @xmath134 from ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "hence point @xmath135 is the same as the critical point considered in the previous section .",
    "the stability of this fixed point can be examined by studying small perturbations around the fixed points : @xmath136 .",
    "we obtain @xmath137 where    @xmath138    eigenvalues of @xmath139 for point i are derived as @xmath140 in the other points @xmath139 has a positive eigenvalue ( which equals 3 ) . if the ( real parts ) of the eigenvalues ( [ 41 ] ) are negative then point i is stable .",
    "this is satisfied for @xmath141    substituting @xmath133 from ( [ 31 ] ) in the above inequality , we find that point i is stable for @xmath142 therefore , if we choose our parameters such that ( [ 43 ] ) is satisfied , all eigenvalues in ( [ 41])become negative and ( [ 30 ] ) describes an attractor solution , towards which the system tends .",
    "but we remember that among the initial situations , the coincidence problem may be alleviated when @xmath2 was settled down at @xmath81 initially ( i.e. before that the scalar factor crossed @xmath143 in ( [ 27 ] ) ) .    to get more physical intuition about the model and its viability , let us depict some figures via numerical methods showing the evolution of the system .",
    "the evolution of the quintessence is depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) using the equations of motion ( ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 13]))and the friedmann equations . to depict this figure",
    ", we assumed that the velocity of the scalar field slightly deviates from zero due to fluctuation around the unstable point @xmath81 after the symmetry breaking .",
    "figure ( [ fig1])shows that the scalar field leaves @xmath81 after the symmetry breaking and tends towards the critical point about which it begins a damped oscillation and finally settles down in a time of order @xmath144 .    in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) the deceleration parameter is depicted using the friedmann equation and ( ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) ) , showing that in a time of order the hubble time the universe experiences transitions from deceleration to the acceleration phase and remains finally in the acceleration phase .",
    "the equation of state parameter of the scalar field is illustrated in fig([fig3 ] ) showing that , at late lime , this parameter is near @xmath145 , which is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "note that crossing the phantom divide line by the scalar field in the nonmimimal teleparallel model was discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a spatially flat flrw space - time was considered in the teleparallel model of gravity .",
    "we tried to describe the onset of late time acceleration via @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "we related this phenomenon to coupling of the quintessence to the torsion .    attributing the acceleration to @xmath0 symmetry breaking",
    "was studied in the hybrid quintessence model as well as in the symmetron model in the usual einstein model of gravity @xcite . however , in these models as , via the symmetry breaking procedure , the scalar field rolls down its potential after its initial stay , the potential decreases while the kinetic energy increases and this is not in favor of acceleration , this can be seen from relation ( [ 18])(with @xmath99 this relation has the same form as the einstein model of gravity ) .",
    "in other words , in these models , it would be better for acceleration that the field stay at its initial position ( with a positive potential ) instead of moving via the symmetry breaking .",
    "so , in these theories , if even a positive acceleration happens ( as it is confirmed numerically in @xcite ) , it is driven by a positive term included initially in the potential playing the role of a cosmological constant and has nothing to do with the symmetry breaking which even reduces the potential@xcite .",
    "this acceleration ends as the quintessence overshoots and oscillates about the new minimum of the effective potential .    in the coupled teleparallel model",
    "the situation changes extremely . as the deceleration factor takes a new form in the non minimally coupled teleparallel model ( see ( [ 18 ] ) ) , a negative coupling provides the conditions required for acceleration , and in contrast to the minimal model drives the universe to a de sitter space time in the late time .",
    "so the deceleration to acceleration phase occurs .",
    "such a transition to a de sitter space - time is forbidden in the minimal case ( see the discussion after ( [ 30 ] ) ) .",
    "the other feature of our model is that the acceleration begins in a universe in which the dark energy density had zero contribution initially .",
    "this is due to the coupling between dark energy and scalar torsion providing a concave effective potential and consequently providing a positive squared effective mass in the early eras ( see [ 23 ] ) .",
    "conditions to have attractor solutions were also derived in ( [ 43 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the deceleration factor and the scalar field and also its equation of state parameter were depicted numerically showing the possibility of having a stable acceleration phase in a time of order of the present hubble time .",
