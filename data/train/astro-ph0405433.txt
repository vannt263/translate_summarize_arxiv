    "the physics in all systems dominated by black holes is essentially the same , and it is governed by the same scaling laws .",
    "the main differences derive from the fact that the scales of length and time of the phenomena are proportional to the mass of the black hole .",
    "if the lengths , masses , accretion rates , and luminosities are expressed in units such as the gravitational radius ( r@xmath0 = 2gm / c@xmath1 ) , the solar mass , and the eddington luminosity , the same physical laws apply to stellar - mass and supermassive black holes @xcite . for a black hole of mass m",
    "the density and mean temperature in the accretion flow scale with m@xmath2 and m@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "for a given critical accretion rate , the bolometric luminosity and length of relativistic jets are proportional to the mass of the black hole .",
    "the maximum magnetic field at a given radius in a radiation dominated accretion disk scales with m@xmath4 , which implies that in the vicinity of stellar - mass black holes the magnetic fields may be 10@xmath5 times stronger than in the vecinity of supermassive black holes @xcite . in this context , it was proposed @xcite that supermassive black holes in quasars and stellar - mass black holes in x - ray binaries should exhibit analogous phenomena .",
    "based on this physical analogy , the word  microquasar \" @xcite was chosen to designate compact x - ray binaries that are sources of relativistic jets ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "a galactic superluminal ejection was observed for first time in the black hole x - ray binary grs 1915 + 105 , at the time of a sudden drop in the batse 20 - 100 kev flux @xcite . since then",
    ", relativistic jets with comparable bulk lorentz factors @xmath6 = 1/[(1-@xmath7)@xmath1)]@xmath8 as in quasars have been observed in several other x - ray binaries @xcite . at present , it is believed that all x - ray accreting black hole binaries are jet sources .",
    "galactic microquasar jets usually move in the plane of the sky @xmath910@xmath10 times faster than quasar jets and can be followed more easily than the later ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "because of their proximity , in microquasars two - sided jets can be observed , which together with the distance provides the necessary data to solve the system of equations , gaining insight on the actual speed of the ejecta . on the other hand , in agn located at @xmath11100 mpc",
    ", the jets can be imaged with resolutions of a few times the gravitational radius of the supermassive black hole , as was done for m 87 @xcite .",
    "this is not presently possible in microquasars , since such a precision in terms of the gravitational radius of a stellar - mass black hole would require resolutions a few hundreds of kilometers .",
    "then , in terms of the gravitational radius in agn we may learn better how the jets are collimated close to the central engine . in summary ,",
    "some aspects of the relativistic jet phenomena associated to accreting black holes are better observed in agn , whereas others can be better studied in microquasars .",
    "therefore , to gain insight into the physics of relativistic jets in the universe , synergy between knowledge of galactic and extragalactic black hole is needed .",
    "microquasars have allowed to gain insight into the connection between accretion disk instabilities and the formation of jets . in @xmath91 hour of simultaneous multiwavelength observations of grs 1915 + 105 during",
    "the frequently observed 30 - 40 min x - ray oscillations in this source , the connection between sudden drops of the x - ray flux from the accretion disk and the onset of jets were observed in several ocassions @xcite ( see figure 3 ) .        from these observations",
    "we have learned the following :    \\a ) the jets appear after the drop of the x - ray flux ,    \\b ) the jets are produced during the replenishment of the inner accretion disk ,    \\c ) the jet injection is not instantaneous .",
    "it can last up to @xmath910 min ,    \\d ) the time delay between the jet flares at wavelengths of 2@xmath12 m , 2 cm , 3.6 cm , 6 cm , and 21 cm are consistent with the model of adiabatically expanding clouds that had been proposed to account for relativistic jets in agn @xcite ,    \\e ) synchrotron emission is observed up to infrared wavelengths and probably up to x - rays .",
    "this would imply the presence in the jets of electrons with tev energies ,    \\f ) vlba images during this type of x - ray oscillations @xcite showed that the ejecta consist on compact collimated jets with lengths of @xmath9100 au .",
    "\\g ) there is a time delay of @xmath95 min between the large drop of the x - ray flux from the accretion disk and the onset of the jets .",
    "these @xmath95 minutes of silence suggest that the compact object in grs 1915 + 105 has a space - time border , rather than a material border , namely , a horizon as expected in relativistic black holes . however , the absence of evidence of a material surface in these observations could have alternative explanations .",
    "after the observation of this accretion disk - jet connection in a microquasar , an analogous connection was observed in the quasar 3c 120 @xcite , but in scales of years rather than minutes .",
    "this time scale ratio is comparable to the mass ratio between the supermassive black hole in 3c 120 and the stellar black hole in grs 1915 + 105 , as expected in the context of the black hole analogy .",
    "x - ray emission has been observed with chandra and xmm - newton in the radio jets , lobes and hot spots of quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "x - ray photons can be produced by inverse compton scattering from the environment of the central engine up to distances of @xmath9100 kpc @xcite .",
    "synchrotron x - ray radiation has been detected in some sources , most notably in the jet of m 87 .",
    "steady , large - scale radio jets are associated to x - ray persistent microquasars @xcite . extended x - ray emission associated to the radio emission was observed in the galactic source ss433/w50 up to distances of @xmath930 pc from the central engine @xcite ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the x - rays extend in the same direction as the sub - arcsec , precessing jets .",
    "the jets in ss433 are hadronic , move with a velocity of 0.26c , and have a kinetic power of @xmath910@xmath13 erg s@xmath2 . since no hot spots have been detected in the shock regions 30 pc away from the central engine , ss433/w50 can not be considered a scale - down analog of a fr ii radio galaxy .",
    "most microquasars with extended jet emission have morphologies analogous to fr i s rather than fr ii s radiogalaxies .",
    "the recent discovery of radio @xcite and x - ray @xcite moving jets in microquasars rise the possibility of studying the formation of radio and x - ray lobes in real time .",
    "these observations show that jets may transport energy in a  dark \" way , namely , in a way that is radiatively inefficient , until shocks are produced .",
    "synchrotron x - ray emission from shocks at large distances from the central engines imply that microquasars are potential sources of cosmic rays and electrons with up to tev energies .",
    "the bulk lorentz factors @xmath6 in microquasars and quasars have similar values , and it had been proposed @xcite that microquasars with jet axis that form angles @xmath1110@xmath14 with the line of sight should appear as  microblazars \" , showing analogous phenomena to blazars . due to",
    "relativistic beaming , in microblazars the brightness of outbursts is enhanced by factors of 8 @xmath15 @xmath6@xmath10 and the interval of time of the phenomena is reduced by factors of 1/2 @xmath15 @xmath6@xmath16 .",
    "then , microblazars should appear as intense sources of high energy photons with very fast variations of flux , which makes them difficult to find and to follow . due to this difficulty and to the relatively low statistical probability of small angles between the jet axis and the line of sight @xcite , it is not surprising that most of the microquasars studied so far exhibit large angles ( @xmath1730@xmath14 ) between the jet axis and the line of sight .",
    "it has been proposed that microblazars may be more frequently found in high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) @xcite . in such binaries , gamma - rays can be produced by inverse compton of the jet particles with the uv photons radiated by the massive donnor star .",
    "in fact , the three microquasars so far proposed as counterparts of variable egret unidentified sources are hmxbs with similar properties @xcite .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 and ss 433 have been invoked @xcite as the milky way counterparts of the two most numerous classes of super - eddington x - ray sources ( ulxs ) in external galaxies . grs 1915 + 105",
    "is a long lasting transient outburst x - ray binary with an evolved donnor of @xmath91 m@xmath18 , whereas ss 433 is a persistent black hole hmxb @xcite .",
    "ss 433 type of ulx s are preponderantly found in starburst galaxies like the antennae , whereas luminous x - ray sources of low mass as grs 1915 + 105 may also be found in galaxies with a low rate of star formation .",
    "most of the ulx s would be stellar - mass black hole microquasars with the following possible properties :    \\1 ) hmxbs that host massive stellar black holes ( m @xmath17 40 m@xmath18 ) with isotropic radiation @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) hmxbs and lmxbs that host stellar black holes ( m @xmath9 10 m@xmath18 ) with anisotropic radiation @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) a few ( @xmath111% ) may be microquasars with relativistic boosted radiation .",
    "these should be very bright , highly time - variable , and have a hard x - ray/@xmath19-ray photon spectrum .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although less numerous , it is not exculded that some ulx s could be accreting black holes of intermediate - mass ( 100 - 1000 m@xmath18 ) .",
    "several teams of researchers are exploring interesting x - ray / radio correlations .",
    "microquasars in the low - hard state exhibit radio / x - ray correlations @xcite . in the low - hard state",
    "the power output of quiescent black holes is jet - dominated and when the system moves to a high soft state the radio jets are quenched .",
    "the same seems to take place in agn @xcite .",
    "a scheme to unify low - power accreting black holes has been proposed @xcite , where the black holes in sgr a@xmath20 , liners , fr i , and bl lac would be analogous to microquasar black holes in the low - hard state .    following studies @xcite of correlations between radio and bolometric luminosities , a fundamental plane of black hole activity in terms of the black hole mass and x - ray and radio core luminosities is proposed @xcite .",
    "this correlation holds for radiativelly inefficient accretion , not for bright thin synchrotron emitting states .    at present , these empirical correlations have large scatters .",
    "however , if they became more robust , the mass of black holes could be inferred from the x - ray and radio fluxes , independently of theoretical models .",
    "time variations of flux may be correlated with the mass of the black hole .",
    "\\1 ) the duration of the x - ray flares observed in stellar - mass black holes and in sgr a * seem to be proportional to the mass of the black holes . in cygnus x-1 and other x - ray black hole binaries , flares with durations of 1 - 10 ms are observed @xcite . on the other hand in sgr a@xmath20 , x - ray flares lasting 400 - 10,000 sec have been observed with chandra @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite",
    ". as expected , the time ratios of the power variabilities are comparable to the black hole mass ratios .",
    "\\2 ) for a given black hole spin , the maximum frequencies of quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of flux are expected to be proportional to the mass of the black hole . in 4 microquasars , 3:2 twin peak x - ray qpos of maximum frequency in the range of 100 - 500 hz",
    "have been observed , from which angular momenta a = j/(gm / c@xmath1 ) = 0.6 - 0.9 have been derived @xcite . on the other hand , 17 min infrared qpos have been reported in sgr a@xmath20 , from which it has been inferred an angular momentum a = 0.52 @xcite . as expected , these qpos appear to scale with the mass of the black hole .",
    "if the 17 min qpo in sgr a@xmath20 is confirmed as a component of a twin peak fix qpo of maximum frequency , this correlation could be used to derive black hole masses , and in particular , those of the super - eddington x - ray sources in external galaxies @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) some properties of the aperiodic variability ( noise ) in agn and x - ray binaries seem to be correlated with the mass of the compact objects .",
    "the break time scale in the power spectra density of black holes seems to scale linearly with the mass of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the broad band break time in the sey 1 ngc 3516 scales linearly with that of cyg x-1 in the low - hard state @xcite .",
    "if this type of correlation is confirmed it could also be used to estimate the mass of black holes in extragalactic super - eddington x - ray sources .",
    "agn frequently exhibit broad iron k@xmath21 lines skewed to low energies @xcite .",
    "the shape of these lines is consistent with emission from the surface of an accretion disk extending from about 6 to more than 40 gravitational radii .",
    "occasionaly the red wing of the line extends below 4 kev and the current explanation is that the disk extends within 6 gravitational radii implying that the black hole is rapidly spinning .",
    "now it is widely believed that this spectral feature is a probe of the immediate environment of black holes @xcite . until recently , only smeared edges with little evidence for line emission had been observed in galactic black hole binaries .",
    "but after chandra , xmm - newton and beppo - sax , similar emission iron lines to those in agn were found , even in the asca archive @xcite .    besides emission lines skewed to low energies , analogous spectra to agn - like warm absorbers",
    "are observed in some x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the absorption is variable and it is believed to be produced in a dense local disk wind rather than in the ism . a finding possibly related to these absorption lines is the discovery with integral of black hole binaries with strong x - ray absorption , much larger than that derived from optical and infrared observations , which also implies that the absorption is local rather than in the ism .",
    "the iron line in stellar black hole binaries can be used to investigate :    \\1 ) the physical models of the k@xmath22 line .",
    "because of the short dynamical time scales , the shape of the line can be correlated with the x - ray state of the accretion disk , and corona - disk interactions .",
    "\\2 ) the dense plasma outflows from accreting black holes .",
    "the study of warm absorber lines similar to those seen in seyferts may be important to estimate the mass outflows in x - ray binaries .",
    "\\3 ) the spin of the accreting black hole .",
    "this is important to test models where the jets are powered by the spin of the black hole .    at present , the main constrain to derive the slope of the iron lines is due to the uncertainties on the shape of the continuum at energies @xmath178 kev .",
    "grbs of long duration may be caused by the formation of a black holes in collapsars @xcite or highly magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that half of the compact objects are produced in primordial binaries and that after their formation a significant fraction ( @xmath920% ) remain in binary systems @xcite , leaving microquasars as remnants .",
    "it is believed that grbs take place in close massive binaries because :    \\1 ) the core must be spun up by spin - orbit interaction in order to provide enough power to the jet that will drill the collapsing star all the way from the core up to the external layers @xcite .",
    "2 ) grbs seem to be associated to sne ic .",
    "this is the class of sne that do not show h and he lines , implying that before the explosion the progenitor of those grbs had lost the h and he layers .",
    "these layers are more easily lost if the progenitor was part of a massive binary that underwent a common envelope phase @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sne ic exhibit 4 - 7 % polarization , which are an indication of asymmetric explosions probably caused by collimated jets .",
    "it is believed that stellar black holes can be formed in two different ways : either the massive star collapses directly into a black hole without an energetic supernova explosion , or an explosion occurs in a protoneutron star , but the energy is too low to completely unbind the stellar envelope , and a large fraction of it falls back onto the short - lived neutron star , leading to the delayed formation of a black hole @xcite . if the collapsar takes place in a binary that remains bound , and the core collapse produced an energetic supernova , it will impart the center of mass of the system with a runaway velocity , no matter the explosion being symmetric or asymmetric .",
    "therefore , the kinematics of microquasars can be used to constrain theoretical models on the explosion of massive stars that form black holes .    using this method",
    "it has been shown that the x - ray binary cygnux x-1 was formed in situ and did not receive an energetic trigger from a nearby supernova @xcite .",
    "if the progenitor of the black hole and its parent association cygnus ob3 are coeval , the progenitor mass was greater than 40 m@xmath18 , and during the collapse to form the 10 m@xmath18 black hole of cygnus x-1 , the upper limit for the mass that could have been suddenly ejected is @xmath91 m@xmath18 , much less than the mass ejected in a typical supernova .",
    "theoretical models suggest that larger mass remnants are associated to subluminous supernovae @xcite .    furthermore , the kinematics of grs 1915 + 105 derived from vlba proper motion of the compact jet for the last 5 years",
    "@xcite show that the 14@xmath234 m@xmath18 black hole @xcite in this x - ray binary probably was formed promptly , as the black hole in cygnus x-1 .",
    "of course , these observations do not exclude the possibility that high mass stellar black holes could also be formed with strong natal kicks , and runaway as unbound solitary black holes , which would be difficult to detect .    on the other hand , the kinematics of gro j1655 - 40",
    "has been a confirmation @xcite of the indirect evidence for an energetic supernova explosion in the formation of this low - mass black hole , inferred earlier from the chemical composition of the donnor star @xcite .",
    "more recently , the observation of the runaway x - ray binaries ls 5039 @xcite and lsi + 61@xmath14303 @xcite confirmed that neutron stars may be formed with strong natal kicks .",
    "it is commonly believed that massive stars with masses above and below a fix mass limit leave black holes and neutron stars , respectively . however , the destiny of a massive star depends on several other factors besides on the mass , such as the metallicity and whether it is solitary or in a binary .",
    "more massive stars evolve to the supernova stage faster , and a lower limit for the mass of the progenitor of the compact object can be determined assuming that the progenitor was coeval with the stars of the parent cluster .",
    "it has been found that the neutron star x - ray binary lsi + 61@xmath14303 was shot out from its birth place in the cluster of massive stars ic 1805 and that the progenitor of the compact object may have had a mass @xmath17 56 m@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , this cluster is in a complex region and a lower mass progenitor can not be ruled out since sequential star formation could have taken place in that region .",
    "the location of magnetars ( soft gamma - ray repeaters ) in clusters of massive stars also sugest that neutron stars may have very massive stellar progenitors .",
    "two of the four known magnetars ( sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 ) are inside dust - enshrouded clusters of massive stars @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that irrespective of their mass there may be a unique universal mechanism for relativistic jets in accreting black holes @xcite ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "although in agn , microquasars and grb sources there are different physical conditions , it was proposed that all jets are produced by an unique electromagnetic mechanism , in which charged plasma is accelerated by electric fields that are generated by a rotating magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the most popular grb jet models at this time are baryon dominated , and the factors that control the jet power , collimation and speed , remain unknown .",
    "besides the targeted observations of known black hole binaries that are reported in other contributions of these proceedings , the gps survey is revealing new hard x - ray sources with spectral properties that are characteristic of accreting black holes .",
    "the observed hard x - ray properties of stellar mass and supermassive black holes are very similar and for obscured sources it is usually needed to determine the redshift of the counterpart to know whether the hard x - ray source is a compact object of stellar mass in a binary or an agn .    in the gps with integral several hard x - ray sources were discovered hidden behind large columns of interstellar gas and dust @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength follow up of these sources is showing that some are dust enshrouded high mass black hole binaries , such as igr j16318 - 4848 @xcite and ax j1639.0 - 4642 = igr j16393 - 4643 @xcite . it is interesting that igr j16393 - 4643 is , as the microquasars ls 5059 and lsi + 61@xmath14303 , inside the error circles of egret sources of high - energy gamma - ray emission , and that these three microquasars have similar properties @xcite .    the number of detections of agn in the gps is smaller than expected on the basis of the sensitivity of integral , and some of the newly discovered hard x - ray sources may be extragalactic @xcite . in fact , after the discovery with granat of a seyfert 1 galaxy at a redshift of 0.021 behind the galactic center @xcite , integral is detecting new hard x - ray agn .",
    "figure 6 shows that igr j21247 + 5058 is the hard x - ray counterpart of the radiogalaxy 4c 50.55 @xcite .",
    "the source igr j18027 - 1455 is probably also an agn , because the photometric properties of the infrared and optical counterpart are not consistent with those of a stellar object @xcite .",
    "the multiwavelength approach to the hard x - ray sources revealed by integral is in progress .",
