    "it can be easily seen from fig.2(a ) that velocity decreases relatively with increasing values of magnetic field parameter .",
    "it happens because of the fact that when blood flows under the influence of magnetic field , the action of magnetization applies a rotational motion on the charged particles of the blood .",
    "the continuous rotational motion of charged particles causes red blood cells to be more suspended in blood plasma and this increases the internal viscosity of the blood .",
    "increased viscosity affects the blood flow by increasing the value of flow resistance , this causes decrement in the value of blood velocity .",
    "lorentz force opposes the motion of blood particles , which reduces velocity of the blood flow @xcite .    from fig.2(b )",
    "it is clear that as the value of magnetic field parameter increases , temperature profile decreases . as it has been discussed above that with an increment in the value of magnetic field parameter results as increasing value of viscosity .",

    "it can be seen clearly from fig.3(b ) that , as value of the grashof number increases , temperature profile also increases .",
    "so increase in the grashof number is for to increase the rate of heat transfer effect at the arterial wall .",
    "figs.4(a ) and 4(b ) in fig.[fig.4 ] display the graphical features of porosity parameter on the profiles of velocity and temperature .",
    "it is clear from fig.4(a ) that velocity profile increases with increasing values of the porosity parameter .",
    "so in the case of porosity parameter velocity has its minimum value at middle of the artery .",
    "velocity profile with porosity parameter shows this behavior may be because , when a fraction of the voids volume over the total volume increases , it can be more possible for fluid to move from one place to another place in the artery .",
    "fig.4(b ) marks that the temperature profile increases with increasing values of porosity parameter and it takes place may be because of viscous nature of the fluid which decreases with increasing values of velocity .",
    "figs.5(a ) and 5(b ) in fig.[fig.5 ] illustrates the distribution of velocity and temperature profiles for different values of the hematocrit parameter @xmath26 .",
    "fig.5(a ) shows that the velocity profile decreases with increasing values of hematocrit parameter . in blood hematocrit",
    "is the volume percentage of red blood cells , and in the artery as the number of red blood cell increases in volume , density of blood flow increases relatively .",
    "increased density of blood slows down the flow of blood and this causes decreased velocity of the blood flow .    from fig.5(b )",
    "it can be clearly observed that as the value of hematocrit parameter increases , temperature profile decreases and so increase in the value of @xmath26 is to decrease the rate of heat transfer at the stationary artery wall .",

    "it can be seen from fig.6(a ) that as the value of the heat source parameter increases , velocity of the blood flow decreases . from fig.6(b ) it is clear that as value of the heat source parameter increases , temperature profile decreases respectively .",
    "it is observed through these figures that velocity and temperature achieves its maximum value at the wall of the artery and attain minimum value at middle of the artery for heat source parameter .",
    "figs.7(a ) and 7(b ) in fig.[fig.7 ] illustrate the distribution of velocity and temperature profiles for different inclination angles of the artery .",
    "fig.7(a ) shows that as the angle made by the artery from vertical axes changes increasingly from @xmath119 to @xmath120 , velocity profile decreases respectively .",

    "<S> in this paper , effects of heat transfer on the blood flow through a stenosed , inclined non - tapered porous artery subject to the action of external magnetic field is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> viscosity is assumed as variable viscosity with variable hematocrit throughout the region of the artery . </S>",
    "<S> governing equations have been modeled by taking blood as incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) newtonian fluid . </S>",
    "<S> energy equation is formulated by taking an extra factor of the heat source in its equation . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear momentum equations are simplified under the assumption of mild stenosis . </S>",
    "<S> homotopy perturbation method ( hpm ) is used to solve nonlinear equations of velocity and temperature profiles . </S>",
    "<S> effects of porosity parameter ( z ) , applied magnetic field parameter ( m ) , variable hematocrit parameter(hr ) , brinkman number ( br ) , heat source parameter ( q ) and the grashof number ( gr ) on velocity and temperature profiles are discussed graphically . + * keywords : * newtonian fluid , incompressible fluid , stenosis , magneto hydro dynamical fluid ( mhd ) , inclined porous artery , variable viscosity , homotopy perturbation method . </S>"
