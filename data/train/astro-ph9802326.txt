    "of all ground - based observatory sites that have been tested for submillimeter - wave sky quality , the best results have come from the amundsen - scott south pole station . in the current decade , a year - round observatory has been established at the pole by the center for astrophysical research in antarctica ( cara ) , an nsf science and technology center .",
    "cara operates three major telescope facilities : ast / ro ( the antarctic submillimeter telescope and remote observatory , a 1.7-m telescope@xcite ) , python ( a cosmic microwave background experiment ) , and spirex ( the south pole infrared explorer , a 60-cm telescope ) .",
    "these facilities are conducting site characterization and astronomical investigations from millimeter wavelengths to the near - infrared@xcite .",
    "profiles of temperature , pressure , and water vapor above the pole have been measured at least daily for decades by the south pole meteorology office@xcite .",
    "measured water vapor values are extremely low because the air is dessicated by frigid temperatures ( annual average : -49c , median winter pwv : 0.25 mm ) .",
    "winds at the pole are unusually low ( maximum recorded wind speed over 30 years : 25 m / s ) , and rain is completely absent@xcite .",
    "atmospheric opacity at the pole has been routinely measured at 225 ghz and 492 ghz using skydip techniques@xcite .",
    "the 225 ghz results are comparable to those made at the proposed nrao millimeter array site at atacama , chile .",
    "this , together with the significantly higher atmospheric pressure at the pole , necessarily implies that the pwv and submillimeter - wave opacity at the pole are somewhat better than at atacama .    a wide - field",
    ", off - axis 10 m diameter submillimeter - wave telescope has been proposed for the south pole by an international consortium .",
    "the south pole 10 m ( sp 10 m ) telescope will be a powerful and highly flexible instrument , usable for a wide variety of submillimeter observations in observational cosmology , star formation , chemistry and dynamics of the interstellar medium , galactic structure , and solar system studies",
    ". the sp 10 m telescope will be optically superior to existing telescopes with respect to scattered radiation , cross - polarization , and field of view and will be located at a site which is consistently much more transparent in the submillimeter - wave atmospheric windows than any other existing or proposed observatory site@xcite .",
    "it will therefore be orders of magnitude faster than existing instruments and capable of detecting much weaker sources .",
    "it will greatly enhance submillimeter - wave capability in the southern hemisphere and provide a single - dish complement to the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) submillimeter array ( sma ) and the nrao millimeter array ( mma ) .",
    "it will make use of large , sensitive bolometer and heterodyne array detectors which are advanced versions of those currently in use on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "the 10 meter telescope will be able to feed 1000 pixels in a detector array .",
    "a workshop was held at harvard university on 28 march 1997 to discuss science goals for the sp 10 m project .",

    "the spatial frequency at which this peak occurs depends on the fundamental cosmological parameter @xmath0 .",
    "additional smaller peaks are expected at multiples of the peak spatial frequency .",
    "present cmbr observations show a clear maximum in the anisotropy spectrum at a spatial scale somewhere near 1 , but the spectrum lacks detail and the harmonic peaks at smaller scales have not yet been seen .",
    "the sp 10 m will study the damping tail region at arcminute scales , providing a strong test of the acoustic oscillation model and providing measurements of peak positions that will augment the lower spatial frequency information obtained with meter - class telescopes .",
    "data from the sp 10 m will be particularly vital if the universe turns out to be open , and the main spatial frequency peak occurs at scales near 0.1 . to study primary anisotropy at arcminute angular scales , it will be important to simultaneously understand the secondary contribution to anisotropy due to sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) distortion in galaxy clusters between the recombination last scattering surface and the observer . because of the low sky noise available at the pole , the sp 10 m can be used over a wide range of frequencies , including the 200 - 300 ghz range of frequencies required to allow spectral separation of thermal s - z effect from primary anisotropy . since there are @xmath1 to @xmath2 visible clusters of galaxies , both the small beam size and wide spectral range of the sp 10 m will be needed to locate the cluster - free regions of sky that will be observed for primary anisotropy studies .

    ".    the thermal component of the s - z effect can be used in combination with x - ray data to provide a measure of the hubble constant ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "in addition , when combined with a measurement of electron temperature , the ratio of the kinematic and thermal component amplitudes provides a direct measurement of the cluster s peculiar velocity relative to the rest frame of the cmb .",

    "<S> a 10 meter diameter submillimeter - wave telescope has been proposed for installation and scientific use at the nsf amundsen - scott south pole station . </S>",
    "<S> current evidence indicates that the south pole is the best submillimeter - wave telescope site among all existing or proposed ground - based observatories . </S>",
    "<S> proposed scientific programs place stringent requirements on the optical quality of the telescope design . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , reduction of the thermal background and offsets requires an off - axis , unblocked aperture , and the large field of view needed for survey observations requires shaped optics . </S>",
    "<S> this mix of design elements is well - suited for large - scale ( square degree ) mapping of line and continuum radiation from submillimeter - wave sources at moderate spatial resolutions ( 4 to 60 arcsecond beam size ) and high sensitivity ( millijansky flux density levels ) </S>",
    "<S> . the telescope will make arcminute angular scale , high frequency cosmic microwave background measurements from the best possible ground - based site , using an aperture which is larger than is currently possible on orbital or airborne platforms . </S>",
    "<S> the telescope design is homologous . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational changes in pointing and focal length will be accommodated by active repositioning of the secondary mirror . the secondary support , consisting of a large , enclosed beam , permits mounting of either a standard set of gregorian optics , or prime focus instrumentation packages for cmbr studies . </S>",
    "<S> a tertiary chopper is located at the exit pupil of the instrument . </S>",
    "<S> an optical design with a hyperboloidal primary mirror and a concave secondary mirror provides a flat focal surface . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively large classical aberrations present in such an optical arrangement can be small compared to diffraction at submillimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> effective use of this telescope will require development of large ( 1000 element ) arrays of submillimeter detectors which are background - limited when illuminated by antenna temperatures near 50 k.    = = = latex = l.42ex -.15emtex # 1= # 1#2=.45 = .45 # 1#2#3#4#5#6#7    to#2    ' '' '' </S>"
