    "the structure of scalar mesons in terms of fundamental constituents is still an open question and widely debatted , for a review see refs .  .",
    "we are interested in the scalar - isoscalar meson @xmath3 , but the formalism we are going to present in this talk is of general interest and applicable to any scalar meson . besides the quantum numbers , what is known about the @xmath3 is its mass and width : @xmath4  mev and @xmath5  mev .",
    "hence , the @xmath3 is a rather narrow state , already known , as well as other scalar resonances , for over thirty years from @xmath6 scattering.@xcite a general analysis of data leads to a picture suggesting that the scalar mesons above 1  gev can be identified as conventional @xmath7 nonet with some possible admixture of gluons , whereas light scalar mesons below or near 1  gev form a flavor nonet _ predominantly _ made of @xmath8 states.@xcite the @xmath3 being the product of a resonant two - pion state at the hadronic level may lead one to think of it as a four - quark state , which is also favored by the observation that such a configuration yields the right quantum numbers without the need for an orbital angular momentum to make a @xmath9 state .",
    "moreover , studies of the scalar mass spectrum below 1  gev suggest a @xmath8 state as originally advocated by jaffe.@xcite on the other hand , scalar mesons produced in @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays leading to three pseudoscalar mesons@xcite seem to indicate a @xmath7 content , although higher statistics in these experiments is desirable .",
    "the emergence of the @xmath3 as a pole of the @xmath6 amplitude in the @xmath12-wave@xcite is also well established in three - body decays of @xmath13-mesons .",
    "recently , distinct peaks about 1  gev were observed in the @xmath6 effective mass range distributions of @xmath14 decays by the babar and belle collaborations.@xcite as of yet , these newer data do not allow to discriminate between a two - quark or a four - quark description of the @xmath3 . nonetheless ,",
    "viewing the @xmath3 _ exclusively _ as a @xmath7 or a @xmath8 state may prove to be misleading . in the case of @xmath14",
    "decays there are plausible reasons to limit oneself to the @xmath7 picture of the naive quark model . due to the large @xmath13-mass ,",
    "the outgoing mesons behave as massless particles , which prompts to expand the corresponding bound states in terms of fock states .",
    "quark configurations like @xmath8 or @xmath15 therefore belong to higher fock states .",
    "it was already suggested by cheng , chua and yang@xcite that the @xmath7 component of the energetic @xmath3 may be more important , as _ two _ rapid @xmath7 pairs are less likely to form a fast moving @xmath3 . in our model",
    "we therefore neglect higher fock contributions to the bound state .",
    "after we have settled down to the @xmath7 state of the @xmath3 , we ought to be concerned with its flavor content .",
    "since the branching ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 have almost the same magnitude , the @xmath3 state must necessarily contain @xmath18 , @xmath19 as well as @xmath20 components .",
    "we write the wave function as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mixing angle and @xmath23 .",
    "we are concerned with an effective description of hadronic corrections to the weak vertex in charged current - quark transitions @xmath24 , @xmath25 which drive the weak decays @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the exponents @xmath28 denote the flavor content of the scalar @xmath7 state . to this end",
    ", we calculate the pseudoscalar to scalar @xmath29 transition amplitude @xmath30 corresponding to the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in a relativistic quark model .",
    "the momenta @xmath31 and @xmath32 belong to the initial pseudoscalar and final scalar meson , respectively .",
    "the transition amplitude is generally decomposed into two terms @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the transition form factors , @xmath36 and the weak current is @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "transition amplitude in relativistic constituent quark model . ]    in the dispersion relation approach , the form factors are derived from the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and expressed through the double spectral representation as @xmath40 the vertex @xmath41 describes the bound - state transition to the constituent quarks and @xmath42 are spectral densities to be discussed below .",
    "the wavefunction of a bound state with negative energy is related to the vertex by @xmath43 where , at the pole , @xmath44 is the mass of the bound state . in the case of @xmath7 pairs , nevertheless , the strong interaction properties lead to confinement , commonly approximated by a harmonic oscillator , and the bound state occurs at @xmath45 . following the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the mass pairs @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the scalar and pseudoscalar meson , respectively .",
    "confinement does smear out the pole and the smooth form of the wavefunction is the usual gaussian one .",
    "it is therefore more convenient to use the wavefunction @xmath50 in eq .   rather than the vertex function , as the pole position cancels .",
    "the normalization of the vertices @xmath41 and therefore of @xmath50 is determined by the rescattering of the two constituent quarks in the meson . including the proper relativistic normalization , a wavefunction like that in eq .",
    "is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the reduced mass of the @xmath7 pair , @xmath53 is the modulus of the center - of - mass quark momentum and@xcite @xmath54 in eq .  , @xmath55 is the normalization of a scalar meson @xmath56 whereas @xmath57 is that of a pseudoscalar meson @xmath58 .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 controls the size of the meson and has to be deduced phenomenologically .",
    "this can be done for @xmath13- and @xmath10-mesons by using constraints like the meson decay constant known from experiment . for neutral scalar mesons",
    "the situation is more tricky  owing to charge conjugation invariance , the @xmath3 can not be produced via a vector current .",
    "alternatively , one defines a scalar decay constant @xmath60 associated with the scalar current , although its value is only vaguely known from theoretical estimations .",
    "we prefer to determine @xmath61 and @xmath62 by fitting @xmath63 @xmath64 branching fractions , as will be discussed in more detail in ref .  .     for the @xmath65 transition @xmath66 ( lower curve )",
    "compared to the @xmath67 transition @xmath68 ( upper curve ) . ]    the spectral densities @xmath42 in eq .",
    "are obtained from the double discontinuities of the triangle diagram.@xcite we apply the landau - cutkosky rules , thus the internal quarks are put on - mass shell ( @xmath69 , to calculate these discontinuities for a @xmath65 transition : @xmath70 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one has the condition @xmath71 and the tilda on the external momenta expresses their off - shellness in the dispersion approach with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these momenta are the dynamical variables in the double dispersion relation of eq .  .",
    "having the explicit form of the spectral densities , one can calculate the space - like form factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath74 and an analytical continuation in @xmath2 yields the time - like equivalent for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the dispersion relations applied to the relativistic quark model allow to derive @xmath76 and @xmath77 transition form factors for the full momentum range , and in particular for the kaon mass @xmath78 needed in the decays @xmath14 .",
    "this is done without any extrapolation and the quark model solely determines the behavior of the form factors . as an example",
    ", we show the _ preliminary _ function @xmath34 for the @xmath79 to @xmath12 transition @xmath66 compared to that for the @xmath79 to @xmath79 transition @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in an upcoming paper,@xcite",
    "we will give an estimate for the errors of these transition form factors . with this work ,",
    "we hope to better determine one component of the hadronic matrix elements in the factorization approach for @xmath13- and @xmath10-decays into scalar mesons , for which most of the uncertainties stem from the non - perturbative character of qcd .",
