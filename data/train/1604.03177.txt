    "this heavy neutrino can be produced on their mass - shell and the decay rates receive an enhancement due to the resonant effect @xcite .",
    "the effects of such a sterile heavy neutrino with masses around 100 mev to a few gev have been widely studied in @xmath1 three - body decays : @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 final state mesons .",
