    "cellular automaton ( ca ) can be used as discrete mathematical models for a variety of phenomena@xcite .",
    "one remarkable feature for ca being used as a model lies in the fact that the setup is mathematically simple . since both dependent and independent variables are discrete and a set of values which the dependent variable takes is finite , a rule table is more suitable for representing logical expression in a ca model .",
    "thus , ca is free from mathematical conditions such as continuity and differentiability .    due to the complete discreteness of ca ,",
    "mathematical tools for analyzing its solutions of ca are very different from those for analyzing solutions of other mathematical objects such as differential equation , finite - difference equation and coupled map lattice .",
    "pattern analysis , graph theory and statistical mathematics are often used to analyze ca @xcite . however , in seeking for a general solution starting from arbitrary initial data of a ca , this difference often becomes an obstacle .",
    "compact expression of solution using special functions is rarely available for ca due to its discreteness .",
    "one of the bridges between discrete and continuous mathematics to solve this problem was found in the area of integrable system . by applying the following simple formula for the transformation of variables ,",
    "@xmath0 we can obtain ca from a finite - difference equation with continuous variables .",
    "this procedure is called ` ultradiscretization'@xcite .",
    "solution of the finite - difference equation can be ultradiscretized by the same procedure .",
    "for example , we obtain a binary ca called ` box and ball system ' from the discrete lotka ",
    "volterra equation through the above transformation@xcite .",
    "moreover , the elementary ca of rule number 184 ( eca184 ) is obtained from the discrete burgers equation@xcite .",
    "eca184 is considered in the subsequent section .",
    "note that we can obtain the differential equation and its corresponding solution by taking a continuum limit for a finite - difference equation and its solution .",
    "the continuous analogue to the discrete lotka ",
    "volterra equation is the korteweg ",
    "de  vries equation and that to the discrete burgers equation is the burgers equation .",
    "therefore three different discrete levels of equations are directly related each other through two types of limiting procedure .",
    "replacing basic operations is another way to obtain an ultradiscrete equation from a finite - difference one .",
    "equation ( [ max - plus ] ) shows that the addition of the finite - difference equation corresponds to the @xmath1 operation of the ultradiscrete one .",
    "the multiplication and division correspond to @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively since we have @xmath4 though the subtraction is not well - defined for the ultradiscrete equation , we can automatically obtain the ultradiscrete equation and its solution through a procedure of replacing @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively if the subtraction is not included explicitly in the finite - difference equation and its solution .",
    "the algebra defined by operations of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is called ` max - plus algebra'@xcite .",
    "binary operations such as and , or and not can be easily converted to max - plus operations . since ca can be defined by binary operations , a rule table of ca",
    "is usually transformed into a max - plus equation .",
    "in contrast to a binary solution to the original ca , the solution to a max - plus equation is real - valued . in this sense , both the equation and the solution are extended to the real value range when we use max - plus algebra .",
    "we should point out that it is important but difficult to express a rule table of ca by an appropriate max - plus equation in order to grasp the behavior of solution analytically .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose max - plus expression for rule table , general solution and asymptotic behavior of a class of evolutional binary ca .",
    "the sum of values of dependent variables at all spatial sites is conserved through time evolution in this class .",
    "eca184 is included in this class .",
    "such ca can be used as an important digital model for transportation or flow phenomena . in regard to the asymptotic behavior of solution for this type of ca , a phase transition can often be observed @xcite . in order to clarify the asymptotic behavior mathematically , finding",
    "a general solution for this type of ca is necessary .",
    "it is found that the max - plus expression is more suitable in finding such a general solution .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : classification ] , we define the class of ca as mentioned above and show examples of solution and observed asymptotic properties . in section",
    "[ sec : max - plus analysis ] , by giving the max - plus expressions of evolution rules , we present general solutions of the ca and , further , analyze the asymptotic behavior based on general solutions . in section  [ sec :",
    "remarks ] , concluding remarks are given . in [ sec : formulas ] , some convenient formulas about max and min operations are listed . in [ sec : proof solution ] , we prove the solution to a specific ca . in [ sec : proof asymptotic ] , we prove the asymptotic behavior of the solution .",
    "let us consider the following evolution equation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are integers , representing the time step and the space site number , respectively . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are also integer constants .",
    "assume that the value of @xmath12 takes either 0 or 1 , thus the above equation ( [ gen eq ] ) gives an evolution rule of binary ca .",
    "the binary function @xmath13 has @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) arguments and we call this ca ` @xmath14-neighbors ca ' .      using a transformation of coordinates defined by @xmath16 , the above equation ( [ gen eq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath17 thus , the solutions to these two equations ( [ gen eq ] ) and ( [ trans1 ] ) can be transformed from one to the other .",
    "therefore , we can identify equation ( [ trans1 ] ) for any @xmath18 with ( [ gen eq ] ) .    applying the transformation @xmath19 to ( [ gen eq ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath20 and can identify ( [ trans2 ] ) with ( [ gen eq ] ) by the same reasoning .",
    "moreover , if we ` flip ' the dependent variable @xmath12 , that is , if we apply the transformation @xmath21 , it follows that @xmath22 although the function @xmath23 is generally different from @xmath13 , we can still identify ( [ trans3 ] ) with ( [ gen eq ] )",
    ".    moreover , there are cases where @xmath13 of ( [ gen eq ] ) does not depend on all of its arguments , for example , in the following equation @xmath24 the number of formal arguments of @xmath13 is three ( 3-neighbors ) but @xmath13 does not depend on the last argument .",
    "therefore , this equation is reduced to @xmath25 , which is of 2-neighbors ca .",
    "let us consider another equation , @xmath26 in which , the values of @xmath12 s at even ( odd ) sites at time @xmath27 depend only on those at even ( odd ) sites at time @xmath8 .",
    "thus , this equation is reduced to @xmath25 , which becomes 2-neighbors ca by the separation of even and odd sites . in the present paper",
    ", we exclude the equations which are reductive to those of less than @xmath14-neighbors from a class of @xmath14-neighbors .",
    "let us consider the following condition for any @xmath8 , @xmath28 which means the sum of @xmath12 , that is , the number of 1 s at all space sites is conserved for arbitrary @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the number of particle at @xmath9-th site and @xmath8-th time step , and each ` 1 ' in the solution represent a particle .",
    "therefore , the particles move among the sites according to the evolution rule defined by ( [ gen eq ] ) without creation or annihilation .",
    "we call the ca satisfying the condition ( [ cons ] ) ` particle ca ' ( pca ) in this sense .",
    "classification and statistical analysis of pca was reported by fuk and boccara@xcite .",
    "if a ca defined by ( [ gen eq ] ) is pca under appropriate boundary conditions , it can always be written in a conservation form , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a ` flux ' for the ` density ' @xmath12@xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath32 is necessary for a particle ca because a system with zero particle will produce zero flux .",
    "this condition can be used to determine an indefinite constant in the expression of @xmath33 .    in what follows ,",
    "we list up all pca of 1-neighbor to 4-neighbors identified in subsection  [ identification ] .",
    "label ` @xmath8 ' or ` @xmath8-@xmath34 ' is assigned to each pca where @xmath8 denotes the number of neighbors , and @xmath34 denotes the subclass of the same neighbors ca if it exists .",
    "rules of pca are defined in the form of ( [ flux ] ) together with a rule table of @xmath33 .",
    "the upper row of the table shows all possible combinations of binary arguments and the lower row gives the values of @xmath33 .",
    "* pca1 : @xmath35 , @xmath36 * pca2 : none * pca3 : @xmath37 @xmath38 * pca4 : @xmath39 @xmath40    for simplicity , let @xmath41 represent the initial time step of the evolution . for pca1 , we have always a trivial static solution @xmath42 .",
    "pca3 is equivalent to eca184 @xcite , which is related to a simple traffic congestion model @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will discuss the dynamics of particles and the asymptotic behavior of solutions for pca3 and 4 .",
    "although the max - plus analysis of pca3 ( eca184 ) was already given in @xcite , we here give a briefly review as a typical scenario of max - plus analysis .    from the rule table of @xmath33",
    ", we can determine the dynamics of a particle system .",
    "in what follows , we show the motion representations of pca3 and pca4 .",
    "note that ` 1 ' denotes a site occupied by a particle and ` 0 ' denotes an empty site .",
    "the motion representation for each pca gives the configurations in which only neighborhoods resulting in a particle motion assuming that by default , in all other cases , particles do not move @xcite . the arrow indicates the initial and final positions for a moving particle in one time step .",

    "the relation between the density and the average flux per site reflects this critical phenomenon well .",

    "the constant is defined by @xmath50 the value of @xmath51 is independent of the initial distribution of particles and depends solely on the density @xmath46 for pca3 , 4 - 1 , 4 - 2 and 4 - 3 , whereas for pca4 - 4 , the value of @xmath51 depends on both the density @xmath46 and the initial condition .",
    "the graph of @xmath51 vs. @xmath46 is called ` fundamental diagram ' in the area of traffic flow analysis .",
    "we use this terminology throughout the present paper and abbreviate it as fd .",

    "the flux function of pca3 was found to be @xmath57 if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are binary . thus , the evolution rule can be rewritten in the following max - plus form , @xmath60 using a transformation of variable from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , @xmath61 we obtain the evolution rule for @xmath13 @xmath62 note that , for simplicity , an arbitrary constant occurring in the process of deriving ( [ potential pca3 ] ) is set to 0 .    the initial value problem of ( [ potential pca3 ] ) can be easily solved as @xmath63 the inverse relation of ( [ trans pca3 ] ) is @xmath64 with an arbitrary constant @xmath18 , from which we have @xmath65 therefore , it is obvious that @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 . using above inequalities , we have @xmath70 for large enough @xmath8 .",

    ", @xmath75 is a constant irrespective of @xmath9 . since @xmath73 , there exists at least one site @xmath9 satisfying @xmath76 or @xmath77 , which resulting in a zero value for the above constant .",

    "similarly we obtain @xmath79 in the case of @xmath80 .",
    "this relation gives fd of pca3 as shown in figure  [ fig : pca3 ] .",
    "this pca is known as the fukui  ishibashi model used for traffic congestion analysis@xcite and its euler and lagrange representation",
    "are studied using max - plus expression@xcite .",
    "asymptotic behavior for the solution of pca4 - 1 is similar to that of pca3 except a few slight differences : 1 ) critical value of @xmath46 is @xmath81 , 2 ) for the smaller region of @xmath46 ( @xmath82 ) , all particles move with a speed of 2 at large enough @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution equation of pca4 - 1 can be described in the following max - plus form , @xmath83 introducing a transformation @xmath84 we obtain @xmath85 by choosing an appropriate value for the arbitrary constant .",

    "it can be shown that the evolution equation of pca4 - 2 is @xmath92 through a transformation , @xmath93 it follows , from ( [ eq pca4 - 2 ] ) , that the evolution equation to @xmath13 is @xmath94 the general solution to equation ( [ potential pca4 - 2 ] ) turns out to be @xmath95    by expanding rhs of ( [ sol pca4 - 2 ] ) , specific examples of @xmath96 for @xmath97 , 2 , 3 are given as @xmath98 the proof for the general solution ( [ sol pca4 - 2 ] ) satisfying ( [ potential pca4 - 2 ] ) is given in [ sec : proof solution ] .    moreover , at large enough @xmath8 , the asymptotic behavior of the solution , as well as the value of @xmath51 , can be shown to be : @xmath99 the proof of the above results is given in [ sec : proof asymptotic ] . in summary , the analytical results reveal the steady state solutions and fd as shown in figure  [ fig : pca4 - 2 ] .",

    "we are unable to find a general solution to this type of pca in the max - plus form .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the condition that the value of @xmath12 is binary in the proof of solutions for pca4 - 2 and 4 - 3 .",
