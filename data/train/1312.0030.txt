    "<S> in order to construct a @xmath0-quadratic spline over an arbitrary triangulation , one can split each triangle into 12 subtriangles , resulting in a finer triangulation known as the powell - sabin 12-split . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown previously that the corresponding spline surface can be plotted quickly by means of a hermite subdivision scheme @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a nodal macro - element on the 12-split for the space of quintic splines that are locally @xmath1 and globally @xmath2 . for quickly evaluating any such spline , </S>",
    "<S> a hermite subdivision scheme is derived , implemented , and tested in the computer algebra system . using the available first derivatives for phong shading </S>",
    "<S> , visually appealing plots can be generated after just a couple of refinements . </S>"
