    "in the last decade anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes and especially their thermodynamics have attracted considerable interest due to the ads / cft duality . according to the ads / cft conjecture",
    "the thermodynamics of the ads black holes is related to the thermodynamics of the dual cft residing on the boundary of the ads space .",
    "it is well - know that the ads schwarzschild black hole is thermodynamically unstable when the horizon radius is small , while it is stable for large radius ; there is a phase transition , named hawking - page transition@xcite , between the large stable black hole and a thermal ads space .",
    "this phase transition is explained by witten as the confinement / deconfinement transition of yang - mills theory in the ads - cft correspondence @xcite .    besides einstein - hilbert action , in their low - energy limit string theories give rise to effective models of gravity in higher dimensions which involve the higher powers of curvature terms @xcite .",
    "however , the higher powers of curvature could in common give rise to a fourth or even higher order differential equation for the metric , and it would introduce ghosts and violate unitarity , therefore , the higher derivative terms may be a source of inconsistencies . among the gravity theories with higher derivative terms ,",
    "the so - called lovelock gravity @xcite is quite special .",
    "its equations of motion contain the most symmetric conserved tensor with no more than two derivative of the metric and it has been proven to be free of ghosts when expanding about the flat space , evading any problem with unitarity @xcite . in this paper , we restrict ourself to explore the first four terms of the lovelock gravity . among these terms , the first term is cosmological term , the second term is einstein term , and the third and the fourth terms are the second order lovelock(gauss - bonnet ) and third order lovelock terms , respectively .    in third order lovelock gravity , the static spherically symmetric black hole solutions",
    "were firstly found in @xcite .",
    "then , they also showed that the asymptotically flat uncharged black hole of third order lovelock gravity may has two horizons , a fact that does not happen in lower order lovelock gravity .",
