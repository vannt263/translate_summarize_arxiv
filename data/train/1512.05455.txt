    "the development of accurate and computationally tractable _ ab initio _ methods for studying correlated electronic systems ranging from single molecules to bulk materials",
    "@xcite is an area of wide interest .",
    "feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite has long attracted attention due to its ability to include exact correlation and finite temperature effects , as well as providing a method that can simultaneously treat electronic and geometric degrees of freedom .",
    "the path integral formulation is one of a number of methods commonly referred to as quantum monte carlo ( qmc)-based algorithms  @xcite .",
    "in general , the use of qmc - based algorithms are hindered by the so - called minus sign problem in which the fluctuating sign of the fermionic density matrix leads to statistical errors that scale exponentially with inverse temperature and system size .",
    "the minus sign problem  @xcite remains a great challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry .    in quantum chemistry",
    ", there are a number of methods used to include electron correlation .",
    "commonly used methods include density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , configuration interaction ( ci )  @xcite , many body perturbation theory(mbpt )  @xcite and coupled cluster(cc )  @xcite .",
    "the cc method has been regarded as the `` gold '' standard  @xcite . these approaches , while very useful , have well - known deficiencies such as the approximate inclusion of correlation ( dft ) , size inconsistency ( truncated ci , such as with single and double excitations or with single , double , and triple excitations ) , or non - variational energies ( cc ) . therefore it is important to investigate alternative approaches .",
    "there are three major numerical methods used to study strongly correlated many body systems .",
    "these are exact diagonalization , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , and qmc .",
    "exact diagonalization is only feasible for small systems since it scales exponentially with the system size .",
    "dmrg has become useful for certain classes of molecules with an order of 50 strongly correlated electrons  @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo method was first introduced and developed by fermi , teller , and metropolis  @xcite .",
    "qmc , unlike exact diagonalization and dmrg , is a scalable method that can be applied to multi - dimensional lattice systems . however , qmc does have the minus sign problem in fermionic and frustrated quantum systems .",
    "a variety of methods have been proposed to alleviate the minus sign problem in qmc .",
    "these include auxiliary field monte carlo  @xcite , shifted contour auxiliary field monte carlo  @xcite , and fixed node diffusion monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a resummation path integral approach  @xcite , which is similar to the silk method , phaseless auxiliary - field qmc  @xcite , a finite temperature version of diffusion monte carlo  @xcite , and full configuration interaction qmc  @xcite have been developed .",
    "the sign - learning kink ( silk ) qmc algorithm originally developed by hall  @xcite can be used to overcome the minus sign problem .",
    "silk has previously been used to study the 3@xmath23 hubbard model and atoms using a small basis set  @xcite .",
    "an approximate version of the method has been used to study small molecules  @xcite .",
    "this method uses a novel learning process to overcome the minus sign problem .",
    "the goal of this work is to investigate the ability of the silk method to reduce the sign problem and accurately calculate potential energy surfaces in model systems with relatively small basis sets .",
    "investigation of the scalability of the method is left for future work .",
    "therefore , silk qmc calculations are performed on h@xmath0o , n@xmath0 , and f@xmath0 at a number of different geometries .",
    "the results of the calculations are compared to the results to exact diagonalization and a variety of quantum chemistry methods and demonstrate that the silk method is accurate and that it reduces the minus sign problem for all geometries .",
    "assume there are a finite set of states composed of slater determinants @xmath3 formed from orthogonal , one electron spin orbitals .",
    "with hamiltonian , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the canonical partition function @xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 using @xmath8 and the identity @xmath9 the partition function becomes    @xmath10    @xmath11 is introduced as a discretization variable that allows for the evaluation of the matrix elements by expanding the exponential , _",

    "horizontal lines correspond to diagonal matrix elements and slanted lines correspond to off - diagonal matrix elements that are referred to as kinks .",
    "the lines at the beginning and end of a kink configuration wrap around due to the @xmath23 operation required by the partition function .",
    "the zero kink configuration contains matrix elements for a single state , the two kink configuration contains matrix elements for just two states , etc .",
    "note that the number of kinks and the number of states are not necessarily equal to each other as it is seen in the four kink configuration . ]",
    "the first term is non - negative .",
    "the @xmath24 is also non - negative since the off - diagonal matrix elements appear as @xmath25 and with @xmath26 and @xmath27 = 1 , @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the sign problem is due to terms with @xmath29 .",
    "the silk method uses a learning algorithm to construct new states as linear combinations of the initial @xmath30 states that minimize the magnitude of the contributions from terms with @xmath29 and thereby reduces or eliminates the sign problem .",
    "[ equ : finaleqn ] has the form of a grand canonical partition function and thus monte carlo methods may be used to evaluate the partition function and its properties .",

    "the average energy of the system can be evaluated using @xmath32 , @xmath33 where kink configurations are sampled from @xmath34 .",
    "simulations are performed in two stages .",
    "the first stage is a `` learning '' period and is used to construct an improved description of the states of the system .",
    "we choose the lowest energy hartree - fock state as the initial state . as the grand canonical simulation proceeds , additional states are inserted and removed and a list is maintained of states that have appeared . at fixed intervals ( 30 iterations in our calculations ) or",
    "when the number of kinks present at the end of a monte carlo pass exceeds a specified number ( 9 in our case ) , the hamiltonian is diagonalized in the sub - space of the states that have appeared since the last diagonalization ( or the start of the simulation ) .",
    "the state is then set to the lowest energy state ( a zero - kink configuration ) and the simulation is continued .",
    "the learning period ends when there are only zero and two kinks configurations present for an extended number of monte carlo passes . at this point ,",
    "the expectation is that the partition function will be dominated by kink configurations with a small number of kinks ( dominated by configurations with 0 or 2 kinks ) as the current set of states will better approximate the ground state of the system than the initial ones .",
    "as currently implemented , the learning stage can be thought of as using the simulation to construct configuration interaction ( ci ) states . in the present work ,",
    "the learning period ranged from 8,000 to 119,000 passes .",
    "the second stage in the simulation is the data acquisition during which the states are not modified and the grand canonical simulation proceeds in the standard way .",
    "if the number of kinks increases dramatically during this stage ( perhaps due to the simulation exploring a previously unexplored region of phase space ) a diagonalization is performed and the second stage is restarted . in the calculations where additional diagonalizations were performed the diagonalization made an insignificant change in the ground and excited state energies . between 1,000 and 2,000",
    "monte carlo passes were used in the second stage .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm consists of two types of moves : change of state and insertion / removal of states .",
    "the former is performed in the standard way using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the latter uses the metropolis algorithm as follows .",

    "so , further optimization is possible by storing often - needed matrix elements in memory .",

    "it is also possible to halt the learning stage at an earlier point , when the ground silk state is not as accurate an approximation to the exact ground state , but when the sign problem is alleviated but not eliminated and rely on the monte carlo sampling to provide the exact energy .",
    "this would reduce the computational effort required to evaluate the matrix elements since fewer diagonalizations will have occurred .",
    "an investigation of the efficacy of a shorter learning period is left for future work .",
    "the silk method requires the knowledge of the off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian . as the size of the system increases",
    ", the number of off - diagonal matrix elements increases factorially and it is not possible to store the matrix elements or the ci coefficients for the ground and excited states that would allow for on - the - fly evaluation of the matrix elements . as such , without a procedure to accurately truncate the number of determinants used to describe the ground and excited state wavefunctions , the use of the all possible determinants in a silk calculation will be limited to relatively small systems .",

    "such truncated sets of determinants are often sufficient for the study of chemical systems . in cases",
    "where restrictions to single and double excitations are not sufficient , more sophisticated methods of truncation , such as the one developed by maurits@xcite , will be needed .",
    "the silk qmc is a versatile method to calculate the ground state energy of molecular systems . since the path integral formulation uses the canonical partition function it is possible to use the silk method to simulate the motion of the atoms at a finite temperature .",
