    "a growing number of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) have been found to show discontinuous stellar distributions along the horizontal - branch ( hb ) .",
    "some of them are clearly bimodal with a hb clump of red stars and a tail of blue , hot stars populating the blue side of the rr lyrae strip ( ngc2808@xcite ; ngc1851@xcite ; ngc6229@xcite ) and more recently ngc362 ( @xcite ) , ngc6388 and ngc6441 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in other clusters the stellar distribution in the hb blue tails ( bts ) is interrupted by underpopulated regions or `` gaps '' ( see for example ngc6752@xcite ; m15@xcite ) .",
    "ngc2808 ( @xcite ) shows both phenomena : it has both a red clump and an extended blue sequence with three groups separated by narrow gaps .",
    "the maximum possible extent of the hb tail is @xmath2mag where it reaches the he - burning main sequence .",
    "this limit is reached in a number of clusters , including ngc6752 , ngc2808 , @xmath3  cen and the subjects of this paper , m13 and m80 . these extreme blue tail ( ebt )",
    "clusters form an important subclass of bt clusters .",
    "all clusters found to date with ebts have indistinguishable , close to @xmath4 . however , not all bt clusters with this metallicity have ebts .",
    "for example , m79 has a bt which extends 3mag below the level of the hb but still falls far short of the he - burning main sequence ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bluest stars in ebts are often separated from their slightly cooler counterparts by a gap analogous to that seen for the subdwarf b stars in the galactic field .",
    "the distribution in color along the hb is understood to be due to a distribution in the envelope masses of stars leaving the red - giant branch ( rgb ; see rood 1973 , buonanno et al .",
    "1985 , @xcite ) . clusters with extended blue hb sequences often show gaps whose physical origin is still a mystery .",
    "they can not be produced by standard single population hb simulations except as statistical artefacts ( @xcite , @xcite , but see also the claims by @xcite ) .",
    "if gaps are observed at the same location in more than one cluster hb sequence , then statistical fluctuation is unlikely to be the cause .",
    "the reality and origin of gaps has been the subject of several studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to bear in mind , though , that even though gaps in cluster hbs may be most apparent in the clusters at metallicity @xmath5 but their causes may still be active in clusters at different abundances . in metal - rich clusters ,",
    "the hbs are collapsed to the red , and gaps that might be present are obscured . in the most metal - poor regime , the sensitivity of a star s initial position on the zahb to envelope mass ( @xmath6 ) is reduced .",
    "a gap in mass @xmath7 that produces a gap at @xmath8 would not necessarily produce a gap at @xmath9 .",
    "instead , a dip in the stellar density might result as suggested for m92 by crocker et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) .    apart from age variations ( see the discussion in the review by stetson et  al .",
    "1996 ) , theoretical studies of hb morphology all require assumptions about the amount and distribution of mass loss on the rgb . unfortunately , the precise understanding of mass loss from cool stars is one of the most vexing problems in stellar evolution theory . indeed , the basic underlying mechanism(s ) for mass loss has ( have ) not been firmly identified . here ,",
    "we adopt as a working hypothesis that _ there is a relationship between gaps and mass loss . _",
    "this suggests that either there is more than one mass loss mechanism or that a single mechanism can lead to a multiplicity of results . by adopting this hypothesis",
    ", we hope to advance our understanding of both phenomena .",
    "there are some indications that the structural parameters of the parent cluster ( see @xcite ) or stellar rotation ( @xcite ) might play a role in hb morphology .",
    "both could plausibly affect mass loss directly .",
    "in addition , both might lead to mixing phenomena occurring on the rgb ( see @xcite ) .",
    "multimodal hbs could easily arise : additional mass loss occurs if the rotation rate exceeds some critical value ; a star visits the cluster center or not while on the upper rgb ; a star mixes or not . because these and other candidate processes are difficult or impossible to model from first principles , a first crucial step in understanding is to secure data for and make comparisons between clusters .",
    "when do gaps occur ?",
    "what are the physical parameters ( , ) of the gaps ?",
    "comparisons must be made to explore the different dimensions of parameter space , e.g. , central cluster density at fixed abundance ; abundance at fixed density .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the hb morphology of three clusters with hb tails of similar metallicity ( @xmath10 ) but different hb tails .",
    "m13 and m80 , using data taken from our cycle 5 hst / wfpc2 program ( go-5903 ) , and m3 from our cycle 4 hst / wfpc2 program ( go-5420 ) .",
    "we study the detailed morphology of the hb sequence in far - uv/@xmath11/optical colors , since in uv cmds the hb is approximately horizontal even at high . to the extent",
    "possible , we make comparisons with gap locations previously observed in other clusters ( ngc2808 , ngc6752 , ngc6681 , @xmath12  cen ) .",
    "exposures for m80 and m13 were taken through the @xmath13 ( @xmath1 f336w , f439w , f555w ) and the mid- and far- uv filters ( f255w , f160bw ) mapping the cluster cores . here",
    "we use only @xmath0 , far - uv exposures .",
    "the cmds presented here are _ preliminary results _ of the four wfpc2 fields obtained with the the pc located on the cluster center . the detailed description of the exposures and data reduction procedure will be given elsewhere ( see @xcite for a brief description ) .",
    "all the instrumental magnitudes have been converted to a fixed aperture and then calibrated to the stmag system using table 9 in holtzman et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "figure  [ m80 ] shows the @xmath14 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for more than 13,000 stars identified in the central region of m80 .",
    "all the stars found in the pc and wfs cameras are plotted .",
    "the reader is referred to figure  1 of ferraro et  al .",
    "( 1997b ) for the cmds of m13 and m3 .",
    "the most notable features of the m80 cmd are : ( 1 ) a very long blue tail of the hb , extending @xmath15 mag ( just as seen in m13 , ngc6752 and the blue side of ngc2808 ) ; ( 2 ) a non - uniform of the stellar distribution along the hb , with at least 4 groups of stars separated by gaps at @xmath16 , 17.5 , and 18.8 . ( 3 ) a relatively large population of supra - hb stars , which will be discussed further in dorman et  al .",
    "( 1997b ) ; and ( 4 ) a large population of blue stragglers , more similar to that found in m3 than to m13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we anticipated a substantial uv bright population on the basis of integrated uv colors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the long blue tail of the m80 hb has been previously observed in the deep @xmath17 cmd of shara and drissen ( 1995 ) .",
    "their hb extension ( ranging from @xmath18 down to @xmath19 ) agrees well with that found from our cmd .",
    "however , the four groups of hb stars clearly visible in our figure 1 can be barely identified in the shara & drissen cmd , perhaps due to their use of aperture photometry which typically gives larger errors than psf fitting .",
    "recently , the long blue tail of the hb has also been observed in a ground - based study of the outer parts of the cluster ( @xcite ) , but again the gaps are only barely visible in that diagram .",
    "the metallicity of m80 is similar to that of m3 and m13 . the zinn ( 1985 )",
    "scale gives the metallicities of m3 , m13 , and m80 respectively as ( 1986 ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 note that new high resolution spectra suggest higher  values for m3 and m13 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , ( kraft et  al .",
    "1992 ) and @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( carretta and gratton 1997 [ cg97 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the determination of the abundance differential between the clusters is more robust than the absolute value .",
    "using equation 7 in cg97 to convert the zinn value to cg97 scale gives @xmath27 for m80 .    to get a better impression of the similarities in the overall morphology in the cmd we align the clusters in the @xmath28 cmd , shifting the cmds to match the m13 principle sequences and then co - adding the result .",
    "the shifts necessary are : @xmath29 and @xmath30 for m80 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 for m3 .",
    "the color shifts imply @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see dorman et  al .",
    "1997b for further discussion ) .",
    "figure  [ cmdall ] shows the combined cmd , in which more than 50,000 stars have been plotted .",
    "as can be seen from the small scatter along the rgb and hb the sequences match well , showing the high degree of similarity of the main branches in the cmd for these clusters . moreover the hb multi - group distribution is still ( perhaps more obviously ) present . for this to be the case",
    "the gaps along the hb of these clusters must have very similar locations in the cmd .",
    "in addition , the hb of m3 nicely matches the reddest part of the hb in m13 and m80 . note that in this plane the rr lyrae gap occurs at @xmath35 and the red hb covers a quite small range in color , since the @xmath36 color is quite insensitive to @xmath37 for temperatures less than or equal to those of rr lyrae stars ( @xcite ) .    in order to bring out the similarities ,",
    "we show in figure 3 a comparison of the hb of each cluster in the @xmath38 plane after alignment .",
    "the relative population of hb stars in the three clusters is 292 , 230 and 163 in m80 , m13 and m3 , respectively ( only non - variable stars have been considered ) .",
    "these numbers reflect the larger mass estimated for m80 and the large fraction of m3 stars which is variable .",
    "figure  [ 160cmd ] shows the comparison of the hb of m13 and m80 in the ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) plane . a shift of @xmath41 and @xmath42 has been applied to m80 to match the m13 sequence .",
    "figure  [ uuvcmd ] shows the @xmath43 cmd .",
    "the gaps are more obvious in some planes than in others , but each gap we discuss is present in each plane .",
    "several important features can be seen in these figures .",
    "first , the location of the cooler gap in m13 and m80 , labeled g1 , is almost coincident with the blue edge of the bulk of the hb population in m3 .",
    "second , the hottest gap is found in similar positions in both m13 and m80 .",
    "third , m80 appears to have another gap , g2 . in figure  [ uuvcmd ]",
    "we see that the m80 stars between g1 and g2 define a sequence somewhat more luminous than that of the adjacent regions or in the comparable part of m13 ( see panel c ) .",
    "finally , figures  [ 160cmd ] and [ uuvcmd ] show an additional gap , g0 , located at @xmath44 .",
    "g0 is less apparent in the @xmath45 cmd because of the compression of the  scale in the @xmath46 color .",
    "however , careful examination of figure  3 does reveal features which can be associated with g0 .",
    "a preliminary comparison with the theoretical models ( dorman et  al .  1993 ) shows that g1 is located at @xmath47 , g2 at @xmath48 and g3 at @xmath49 in m13 and @xmath50 in m80 , and g0 at @xmath51 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that g0 , g1 , and g3 are located at nearly the same temperature ( within 1500 ) in each cluster .",
    "in order to study the stellar distribution along the hb properly and to test for the existence and significance of features like gaps , rood & crocker ( 1985 , hereafter rc85 ) and crocker et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) introduced a coordinate which was `` linear '' along the entire length of the hb .",
    "such a coordinate was required to avoid `` artificial '' features ( clumps , etc . )",
    "generated by the saturation of the color index as it becomes insensitive to changes in the temperature .",
    "rc85 defined a @xmath52 coordinate which measured the star position along the hb as its projection on the theoretical zahb ( see figure  1 in rc85 ) .",
    "analogously ferraro et  al .",
    "( 1992a , b ) , dixon et  al.(1996 ) , and , more recently catelan et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) have used a coordinate @xmath53 , based only on observable quantities .",
    "utilizes the mean ridge line for the linear coordinate along the hb in the observational plane",
    ". we will use  to study the peculiar distribution along the hb tail for the m13 , m80 pair in more detail .    because of the high degree of similarity of the main branches in m13 and m80 ( see fig 2 ) , as first step we have selected the non - evolved hb stars in the @xmath38 plane in the co - aligned sample .",
    "a total sample of 492 stars ( 221 in m13 and 271 in m80 ) has been fit by a 6th order polynomial to define the mean ridge line .",
    "each star was then projected onto the ridge line , and a curvilinear coordinate ( @xmath53 ) has been computed along it .",
    "the zero point of the @xmath53 coordinate has been arbitrarily taken to be @xmath54 .",
    "the  distributions for each cluster and the co - added sample are shown in figure  [ lhb ] . from the inspection of panels ( a ) and ( b ) in figure  [ lhb ] ,",
    "it is evident that the stellar distribution along the tail of these clusters is quite complex .",
    "despite the fact that neither hb is uniformly populated and the hb distribution is quite different in the two clusters , there are some striking similarities in their overall morphology . these similarities are generally best seen in the co - added sample displayed in panel ( c ) .",
    "note in particular :    1 .",
    "the global length of the two hbs is approximately the same ( @xmath55 ) ; only one star in m80 ( located at @xmath56 ) has been found beyond this limit .",
    "the bulk of the reddest stars ends at the same location @xmath57 .",
    "the bluest groups start at the same location @xmath58 .",
    "the co - added sample shows at least three main groups of stars that could be modeled individually by separate gaussian distributions with different means and dispersions .",
    "these groups are separated by two underpopulated regions ( at @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "additional `` depressions '' in the star counts are located at @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in the following",
    "we denote the three main groups of stars as follows :    ubt : :    upper blue tail hb stars : @xmath63 mbt : :    mid - blue tail hb stars : @xmath64 lbt : :    lower blue tail hb stars @xmath65 .",
    "it is the presence    of a substantial population of lbt stars which sets ebt clusters apart    from other bt clusters .",
    "the relative population of the hb stars in these groups , and the values are given in table  1 .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of stars in the lbt is much larger in m13 ( @xmath66 ) than in m80 ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "( 1997 ) have recently discussed the problem of determining the statistical significance of the gaps . from an extensive set of the synthetic hbs they found that the procedure described by hawarden ( 1971 ) and newell ( 1973 ) , often adopted to evaluate the significance of gaps ( e.g. , ferraro & paresce 1993 , crocker et  al .",
    "1988 ) , substantially overestimates their statistical significance . as a first attempt to quantify the probability of finding gaps along the blue hb , they assumed that the stellar distribution in @xmath53 coordinate is uniform , and computed the probability of a gap of given depth ( number of stars in a given range of @xmath53 less than some value ) anywhere along the hb sequence . under this idealized assumption",
    "the probability is naturally governed by the binomial distribution    to follow their procedure we first plot in figure  [ lhbcum ] the normalized cumulative  distribution for m13 and m80 . in this plot",
    "the gaps should appear as horizontal regions , and their location is indicated by arrows .",
    "the typical size of the gaps in this coordinate is @xmath68 and the hb sequences has length up to @xmath69 divide the bt into 15 bins of width @xmath70 given the total number of hb stars and the number of stars actually found in each gap , one can evaluate the probability that a gap of similar depth would be found somewhere along the blue hb .",
    "the bluest gap in m13 ( g3 ) has quite a low statistical significance , with the probability that it is due to chance @xmath71 .",
    "however , the probability that this depression in the star counts occurs _ close to the same @xmath53 value in both clusters _ remains small .",
    "all the other gaps that can be seen in the @xmath38 cmd , are deep enough to have quite high a statistical significance ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the variation of hb morphology among clusters of similar metallicity is known as the _ second parameter _ ( ) problem .",
    "however , all of the complexities of hb morphology may not be so easily classified .",
    "the  problem has aspects that require comment here as a result of these new observations .    1 .",
    "there is evidence in favor of a `` global '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) . by `` global '' we mean some process or circumstance that acts to vary hb morphology at fixed metallicity in the cluster system as a whole .",
    "we exclude from `` global '' individual differences between cluster hb morphology that might arise through exceptional circumstances in certain clusters ( e.g. , ngc2808 ) .",
    "one possible global  that has been explored extensively is age ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , which shifts the peak of the hb color distribution to the blue .",
    "parameters that characterize the bulk hb morphology ( @xcite ) do not describe the overall extension of the bt .",
    "bts may be driven by a special `` , '' which we will call the .",
    "fusi pecci et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) and buonanno et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) noted a strong correlation between the blue tail extension and the cluster central density , which they suggested as `` a '' .",
    "stellar rotation ( @xcite ) and helium mixing ( @xcite ) are other plausible s. in addition , there is a subset of the bt clusters with highly extended blue tails ( ebt clusters ) in which mass loss goes to completion in a significant fraction of the hb stars . until recently , ngc6752 was the only known example of this morphology ( @xcite ) , but in the last few years it has been joined by @xmath12 cen ( @xcite ) , ngc2808 ( @xcite ) , in addition to m13 and m80 .",
    "features like the bt gaps may be regarded as  `` fine structure . ''",
    "our tentative working assumption is that this fine structure is imposed on the hb by rgb mass loss .",
    "mass loss `` structure '' could well be linked to different physical processes like cluster core interactions or stellar rotation , or perhaps by other unknown factors  i.e .",
    ", whatever is driving the bts is also establishing the hb fine structure .",
    "the results of the processes causing these fine structure phenomena may look very different in clusters of higher and lower metallicity .    in ferraro",
    "et  al .",
    "( 1997b ) , we made a comparison of the hb morphology of m3 and m13an extreme example of a second parameter pair .",
    "since the relative locations of the main loci ( rgb , hb , ms - to ) of those clusters was quite similar , we argued that that _ age can not be responsible for the hb differences observed in m3 and m13_. since the fiducial sequences of m13 and m80 can also be aligned , there is _ no reason to infer that the age of m80 is significantly different from that of m3/m13_.    we can now bring m80 into the discussion to illuminate further the possible role of cluster dynamics on hb morphology .",
    "m3 and m13 have almost the same central density ( @xmath73 ) but different hb morphology ( ferraro et  al .",
    "m80 is one of the most concentrated clusters in the galaxy ( @xmath74 ) which has no evidence for a core collapsed state ( i.e. its surface brightness profile can be modeled by a king - michie model ) .",
    "despite the fact that m80 s core density is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of m13 , its hb morphology is very similar .",
    "thus , either cluster density is not affecting hb structure in m13 & m80 , or different s are at work in the clusters . coupled with the fact that density can not account for the m3/m13 difference",
    ", this appears to rule out density as the sole .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation between bts and high density seems very strong and can not be discounted .",
    "almost every high density cluster with @xmath75 has a blue tail .",
    "even some high metallicity , high density clusters ( ngc6388 and ngc6441 @xcite ) have now been found to have the analog to a bt . in ngc6388 , for example , @xmath76 of the stars in core have suffered a large degree of mass loss . yet 47  tuc ( @xcite ) , which is almost as dense , has only a small number of blue hb stars , very few of which are in the core .    beyond the observed correlation ,",
    "an attraction of high cluster density as a  is that it is easy to imagine that a multi - modal distribution blue stars might be produced through tidal interactions .",
    "one possibility was presented by sosin et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) discussing the case of ngc2808 .",
    "they argue that the ebt with gaps in that cluster might arise through groups of stars undergoing events that strip discrete amounts of mass from rgb envelopes .",
    "the expectation would be that the most extreme mass loss happens to the stars with the highest number of interactions .",
    "a consequence of this mechanism is that the bluest stars would be relatively rare , which is not what is observed .",
    "likewise high density should be correlated with the number of capture - binaries ( @xcite ) . while binary evolution might account for sparsely populated bts like the few stars in m3 , or perhaps the few ehb stars beyond the bulk of the bt in m15 , the substantial bts we discuss here are almost certainly some variant of single hb stars .",

    "2 .   if one allows for some imprecision in the @xmath12  cen results there is a suggestion that all ebt clusters have a gap ( g3 in m13 , m80 , ngc6752 , and g2 in ngc2808 ) at @xmath88 . we will call this the 18kk gap .",
    "3 .   g0 & g1 occur in many but not all clusters .",
    "the location and widths of these gaps may vary cluster to cluster , but are at similar locations in the clusters in which they are present .",
    "hb / post - hb evolutionary tracks change morphology at a  similar to that of g3 .",
    "the hotter stars ( so - called extreme - hb or ehb ) evolve essentially vertically in the h - r diagram and do not return to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) after core he exhaustion .",
    "the entire post - hb evolution is spent at high  as  stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cooler stars return to the agb .",
    "it is tempting to identify the `` 18kk '' gap with the onset of ehb behavior ( newell 1973 ) .",
    "rood et  al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) show that the transition from normal hb track morphology to ehb morphology does not produce a gap .",
    "however , a combination of this factor plus considering mass loss to be function of a random ( but unimodal ) mass loss efficiency ( @xmath89 ) as suggested by dcruz et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) can produce a gap ( whitney et  al.1997 ) .",
    "basically , a large range in @xmath89  produces ehb stars and thus a pile - up on the hot end of the hb .",
    "coupled with a sparse population along the rest of the bt , this can lead to gap near but not necessarily at the normal - hb - ehb transition . while the dcruz et  al.(1996 ) result was based on a specific model , they argued that the result was more general and that the distribution of stars below the ehb gap could lead to observational evidence as to how the rgb mass loss turns - off ( rood et  al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "the gap we have labeled g0 occurs frequently enough that it may be real .",
    "it occurs near the hot end of the traditional `` horizontal '' ( in the @xmath79 cmd ) hb .",
    "this gap is present in some but not all clusters .",
    "the gaps g1 and g2 are more complicated because g2 appears in m80 but not m13 .",
    "we suggest the following scenario ( refer to all three panels of figure  [ uuvcmd ] for the following discussion . )",
    "our working hypothesis is that bt - gaps arise because rgb mass loss does not uniformly populate the zahb .",
    "it seems unlikely that a mass loss process would produce a zahb region completely devoid of stars , and more likely that there would be a mass loss range with low probability .",
    "this would produce a sparsely populated region of the zahb , which in combination with small number statistics could produce a gap .",
    "we suggest that the entire g1g2 region is a `` sparse population gap '' ( recall that the m80 stars in this region are slightly overluminous with respect to the cooler stars ) .",
    "such a gap might contain a few near zahb stars .",
    "in addition , it might contain stars which originated from the more richly populated regions on the hot side of the gap that are now evolving back toward the agb .",
    "the latter are analogous to the rr  lyrae population in clusters like m92 and would be more luminous than the bulk of the hb stars .",
    "( this group would not be present in g3 assuming our identification of g3 as the ehb gap is correct . ) as luck would have it most of the g1g2 stars in m13 are from the sparse zahb group , and those in m80 have evolved from the hotter parts of the hb .",
    "no explanation for the g0 and g1/g2 leaps forward .",
    "one possibility is that there are two mass loss mechanisms , ml1 and ml2 , driven by different engines . in all clusters mechanism 1",
    "operates and produces a mean mass loss of @xmath90 .",
    "ml1 almost certainly is a function of metallicity .",
    "for example , fusi pecci et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) argue that very metal - poor stars probably lose less total mass . in clusters where ml1 is the predominant mass loss mechanism",
    ", one observes normal  behavior .",
    "in addition , a global  like age would produce the expected behavior , e.g. , increasing age @xmath91 bluer hb .",
    "a second mechanism operates to different degrees in different clusters and on individual stars within each cluster . in some clusters it is insignificant compared to ml1 . where it is significant",
    ", ml2 is basically the .",
    "ml2 is probably driven by different engines including cluster density and stellar rotation .",
    "it may be accompanied by subsidiary effects like he - mixing which lead to diverse outcomes .",
    "if ml2 operates very efficiently , some hb stars are effectively removed from the distribution of ml1-only hb stars producing a gap .",
    "if ml2 is only mild , the ml1 + ml2 stars might form a tail merging into the ml1-only hb .",
    "this might fit the bimodality - without - a - gap suggested by crocker et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) for clusters like m92 .    whether an alternate mechanism could mimic ml2 without additional",
    "mass is not clear . in the sweigart ( 1997 )",
    "he - mixing models , substantial mixing was usually accompanied by substantial mass loss , although the free - parameter space is large enough that this might not be required . in general",
    "though , it is easier to modify the composition of a rgb envelope if most of the envelope has been lost .    clearly , building a case for a scenario like that above will require data from more clusters and a more precise determination of the gap parameters in each cluster . also requiring further study",
    "is the nature of the gaps . are there forbidden zones which should be completely devoid of stars except those scattered in by observational error ? perhaps as suggested above , they are just underpopulated regions ?",
    "there are other cluster phenomena which may be related to hb morphology .",
    "even if a causal connection can not be established it is worth searching for correlations .",
    "the phenomenon most likely correlated with bts is rgb mixing as shown through the abundances of the cno elements .",
    "@xcite noted the difference in rgb cno processing in their study of m3 & m13 .",
    "they searched for similar correlations in other clusters .",
    "in particular they note that the most highly processed super - oxygen - poor stars ( sop ) of kraft et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) are found only in clusters with very blue hbs .",
    "as far as we are aware , the required abundance study of m80 has not been done .",
    "we might predict on the basis of hb morphology that m80 will have sop stars .",
    "@xcite noted a possible correlation between hb - morphology and cluster ellipticity .",
    "for the m3/m13 pair this seemed an interesting possibility ( ferraro et  al.1997b ) .",
    "for m80 the ellipticity is 0.06 , compared to 0.01 & 0.12 for m3 & m13 , respectively .",
    "so the correlation is neither strengthened nor weakened since m80 could be inclined to our line of sight .",
    "another perhaps remote possibility is a correlation with the parameters of the clusters orbits in the galaxy ( e.g. , dauphole et  al .",
    "the current sample of cluster orbits is small and does not include m80 .",
    "using _ hst _  uv / visual observations we have found that the hb of the globular cluster m80 has a long blue tail extending below the ms - to .",
    "the stellar distribution along the hb is not uniform , but contains four gaps .",
    "s hb is strikingly similar to that which we have found earlier in m13 . in particular , the locations of three of the gaps are similar . because of this we argue that the gaps are real , i.e. , they are not statistical fluctuations , and that the gaps owe their origin to some yet unidentified physical process  most probably associated with rgb mass loss .",
    "the role of central density in determining the hb morphology of m80 , m3 , and m13 is not at all simple . m13 and m3 have similar ( lowish ) densities and very different hbs .",
    "the density of m80 is almost two orders of magnitude higher and its hb morphology is quite similar to that of m13 .",
    "the correlation of density and hb - bts in other clusters is quite strong .",
    "we present a tentative working scenario : first , the problem is perhaps not a single game ( e.g. , cricket and baseball  similar sports which are indistinguishable and incomprehensible to non - aficionados ) ; second , there many players participating in the  games , to different degrees from cluster - to - cluster and star - to - star .",
    "though this may seem to be _ ad hoc _ , we note that nature is complex and that these stars have lived crowded together for billions and billions of years .",
