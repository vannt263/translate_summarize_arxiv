    "radiative association of @xmath0 and @xmath1 produces @xmath2 in various vibrational - rotational states .",
    "recent studies of @xmath3 chemistry in the early universe indicated the necessity of accounting for the vibrational - rotational state distribution of the @xmath2 population in the absence of local thermodynamic equilibrium , which accordingly requires `` state - resolved '' , i.e. , vibrational - rotational state resolved , calculations of data for the @xmath4 radiative association process and for the inverse process , photodissociation of @xmath2 .",
    "the absence of such data in the literature was noted by  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "the necessary data to calculate radiative association and photodissociation cross sections for each vibrational - rotational level of @xmath2 are presented .",
    "cross sections so assembled can then be summed or averaged as required for particular applications , e.g. , rate coefficients for non - local thermal equilibrium models .",
    "in addition to being useful for early universe chemistry models , @xmath2 photodissociation cross sections enter in models of the solar atmosphere  @xcite , where @xmath2 is vibrationally excited  @xcite , and in models of the atmospheres of da white dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "the radiative association reaction @xmath5 and its inverse process photodissociation @xmath6 for a photon of energy @xmath7 are related through microscopic reversibility  @xcite , where @xmath8 ) denotes the vibrational @xmath9 and rotational @xmath10 quantum number of the molecular ion .",
    "the rate coefficients for  ( [ ra - rxn ] ) calculated by  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are in agreement . the cross section summed over all bound states @xmath11 of @xmath2 was given by  @xcite .",
    "the photodissociation cross sections for ( [ pd - rxn ] ) were calculated by  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . where individual data for select @xmath11 levels and photon energies @xmath7 is given there is general agreement between their calculations .",
    "a tabulation of the photodissociation cross sections for each of the vibrational states @xmath12 is given in the report of  @xcite .",
    "recently , calculations of the photodissociation cross sections were carried out for applications to da white dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "the cross section for radiative association  ( [ ra - rxn ] ) is  @xcite @xmath13 , \\ ] ] and @xmath14 is the matrix element of the transition dipole moment between the continuum wave function of energy @xmath15 and angular momentum @xmath10 and the bound vibrational - rotational wave function , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the reduced mass of the colliding system , @xmath7 is the photon energy , and @xmath18 is the probability of approach in the @xmath19 electronic state .    the cross section for photodissociation is  @xcite @xmath20   .\\ ] ]    in eqs .",
    "( [ ra - cross - all ] ) and ( [ pd - cross - all ] ) the nuclear spin symmetry weighting is omitted and it can be included later if the cross sections are being folded into a temperature distribution  @xcite .",
    "the effect of centrifugal distortion is negligible for the repulsive @xmath19 state and it is a good approximation to replace @xmath21 and @xmath22 by @xmath10 in eqs .",
    "( [ ra - cross - all ] ) and ( [ pd - cross - all ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath23 and the cross section for photodissociation is @xmath24 a comparison of  ( [ ra - cross ] ) and ( [ pd - cross ] ) shows that @xmath25 in accordance with microscopic reversibility  @xcite .",
    "thus , tabulation of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath26 , @xmath15 , and @xmath27 provides the necessary information for calculations of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , subject to the requirement @xmath30 for either  ( [ ra - cross ] ) or ( [ pd - cross ] ) , where @xmath26 is the vibrational - rotational eigenvalue in the @xmath31 state measured with respect to the dissociation limit ( taken to be zero here ) .",
    "the born - oppenheimer potential energy surfaces for the ground @xmath31 state and excited @xmath19 state were calculated using the methods described by  @xcite and extended asymptotically as in  @xcite .",
    "the transition dipole moment was calculated using a variational method  @xcite and extended using the asymptotic formula of  @xcite .",
    "energy differences and oscillator strengths are in excellent agreement with the recent calculations of  @xcite .",
    "there are 423 bound vibrational - rotational levels for @xmath2 in the @xmath31 state . in the present work , the born - oppenheimer potential is used and adiabatic , relativistic , and radiative corrections are ignored .",
    "it is worth noting that more precise approaches yield the same number of bound levels  @xcite , but due to the inclusion of higher order corrections the resulting eigenvalues differ from those obtained using only the born - oppenheimer potential . for the present purposes ,",
    "the corrections are not needed .",
    "the energy - normalized continuum wave functions on the @xmath32 state were evaluated as in  @xcite .",
    "the quantities are calculated at a range of energies from the threshold energy @xmath33 for photodissociation of level @xmath11 to a maximum photon wavelength of @xmath34 ( 22.5  ev or 0.828 a.u . ) .",
    "only values of @xmath35 are listed .",
    "table  [ table ] gives the vibrational quantum number @xmath9 , the rotational quantum number @xmath10 , the relative energy @xmath15 in atomic units of energy ( 27.2114 ev ) , the eigenvalue @xmath33 in @xmath36 , the photon wavelength @xmath37 in nm , and the value of @xmath27 in atomic units .",
    "the photodissociation cross section in units of @xmath38 is  @xcite @xmath39 with @xmath40 in nm and @xmath27 in atomic units .",
    "the radiative association cross section in units of @xmath38 is  @xcite @xmath41 with @xmath40 in nm , @xmath15 in atomic units , and @xmath27 in atomic units .",
    "@xcite calculated the photodissociation cross section for @xmath42 to @xmath43 using the potential energy surfaces calculated by @xcite .",
    "there are slight differences between the accurate potential energy surfaces of the present work and the early calculations of @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "agreement is generally good between the current calculations and the tabulated values of @xcite . in figure  ( [ pd - fig ] ) for @xmath44 , a plot of @xmath29 calculated from the data in table  ( [ table ] ) is presented .",
    "the representation is very good and the tabulated data reflect the peaks arising from the @xmath45 bound state wave function .",
    "the present tabulated data can be interpolated using cubic splines , but due to the oscillations several intervals should be selected .",
