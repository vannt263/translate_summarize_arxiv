    "damped lyman-@xmath0 systems observed in qso spectra are characterized by large neutral hydrogen column densities .",
    "the systems at high redshift have been claimed to arise through large disks , progenitors of present - day galaxies ( e.g. wolfe 1995 ) , but this is a matter of debate .",
    "earlier searches for associated 2 molecules , though not systematic , have led to small values or upper limits on the molecular fraction ( black et al .",
    "1987 ; chaffee et al . 1988 ; levshakov et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this is intriguing as , in the disk of our galaxy , all clouds with @xmath15(hi ) @xmath16 have @xmath15(h@xmath6 ) @xmath17 ( e.g. jenkins & shaya 1979 ) .",
    "more recently , ge & bechtold ( 1999 ) , have searched eight dla systems for molecular hydrogen using the mmt moderate resolution spectrograph ( @xmath18  =  1   ) .",
    "they detect molecular hydrogen in two of them with surprisingly large molecular fractions ( @xmath4  =  0.22 at @xmath19 toward q 0013@xmath3004 , see also ge & bechtold 1997 , ge et al . 1997 ; and @xmath4  =  0.07 at @xmath20 toward q 1232@xmath21082 ) . for other systems ,",
    "they find upper limits on @xmath4 ranging between @xmath22 and 10@xmath8 .",
    "reliable measurement of 2 column densities is achieved only from high spectral resolution data however . for the @xmath23 dla system toward pks 0528@xmath3250 , srianand & petitjean ( 1998 )",
    "have estimated , from high - resolution data , @xmath5(h@xmath6 ) @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which is a factor of fifteen smaller than what had been claimed from low - resolution data ( foltz et al .",
    "1988 ; see however levshakov & varshalovitch 1985 ) .",
    "formation of h@xmath6 is expected on the surface of dust grains if the gas is cool , dense and mostly neutral , and from the formation of negative hydrogen if the gas is warm and dust free ( see e.g. jenkins & peimbert 1997 ) .",
    "destruction is mainly due to uv photons .",
    "the effective photo - dissociation of h@xmath6 takes place in the energy range @xmath27 ev through lyman - werner band line absorption .",
    "constraints on the kinetic and rotational excitation temperatures , the particle density and the radiation field can be derived from 2 absorption .",
    "a direct determination of the local radiation field could have important implications for our understanding of the link between dla systems and star formation activity at high redshift .",
    "we present here a high - resolution mini - survey of dla systems focussed on the search for 2 molecules .",
    "section  2 describes the data , section  3 details the sample , while results are given and discussed in sections  4 and 5 .",
    "the ultra - violet and visible echelle spectrograph ( dodorico et al . 2000 ) mounted on the eso kueyen 8.2  m telescope at the paranal observatory has been used on april 5 to 8 and 29 , 2000 to obtain high - spectral resolution spectra of eight previously known dla systems at @xmath2  @xmath14  1.8 .",
    "settings have been adjusted in both arms to cover the 2 werner and lyman series absorption range together with several important metal absorption lines .",
    "the slit width was 1  arcsec ( the seeing @xmath18 was most of the time better than 0.8  arcsec ) and the ccds were binned 2@xmath72 resulting in a resolution of @xmath2845000 . the exposure time @xmath282  hours was split into two exposures .",
    "the data was reduced using the uves pipeline , a set of procedures implemented in a dedicated context of midas , the eso data reduction package .",
    "the main characteristics of the pipeline is to perform a precise inter - order background subtraction for science frames and master flat - fields , and an optimal extraction of the object signal rejecting cosmic ray impacts and subtracting the sky at the same time .",
    "wavelengths were corrected to vacuum - heliocentric values and individual 1d spectra were combined together .",
    "the resulting s / n ratio per pixel is of the order of 10 at @xmath283500     and 20 at @xmath286000   .",
    "results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "in addition to the eight dla systems observed during our mini - survey , we have used eso public data on two qsos : q  0000@xmath3263 and q  1101@xmath3264 have been observed during , respectively , uves commissioning and science verification .",
    "we have included in our sample the system at @xmath2  =  1.839 toward q  1101@xmath3264 although it does not qualify as a dla system following the conventional definition , log  @xmath5(h  i )  @xmath14  20.3 .",
    "indeed , the former definition has no physical grounds . for log  @xmath5(h",
    "i )  @xmath14  19.5 , damped wings are conspicuous and although care should be exercized when discussing ionization corrections , in most cases , these corrections are small ( e.g. petitjean et al . 1992 ; viegas 1995 ) .",
    "we use the standard definition [ x / h ]  =  log  @xmath29(x ) @xmath3 log  @xmath29(x)@xmath30 where @xmath29 is the metallicity of species x relative to hydrogen .",
    "solar metallicities are from savage & sembach ( 1996 ) .",
    "our data confirms the presence of 2 absorption at @xmath2  =  2.3377 toward pks  1232 + 082 ( fig .",
    "[ h2 ] ) , previously detected by ge & bechtold ( 1999 ) .",
    "we summarize and complement here the results presented elsewhere ( srianand et al .",
    "the metallicity in the corresponding log  @xmath5(h  i )  =  20.9@xmath310.1 dla system , estimated from lines of mg  ii , s  ii and si  ii is 6.3@xmath310.7@xmath710@xmath32 solar .",
    "iron is depleted by a factor of @xmath285 compared to this ; the depletion factor is therefore reduced compared to previous measurements .",
    "the molecular fraction @xmath4  = 4@xmath710@xmath8 is two orders of magnitude smaller than what has been claimed previously from low - resolution data .",
    "absorption profiles corresponding to transitions from @xmath33  @xmath14  1 rotational levels are consistent with a single component at the same redshift as c  i absorption .",
    "lines from the @xmath34 and 1 levels are broader and are well fitted with four components at  =  2.3372 , 2.3374 , 2.3377 and 2.3378 .",
    "the respective excitation temperatures between the levels @xmath33  =  0 and @xmath33  =  1 are @xmath35 , 78@xmath36 , 170@xmath37 and 67@xmath38  k.    the physical conditions within the cloud at @xmath2  =  2.3377 can be constrained directly from the observation of h@xmath6 , c  i , c  i@xmath39 , c  i@xmath40 and c  ii@xmath39 .",
    "the kinetic temperature is defined by the @xmath33  =  0@xmath31 2 excitation temperature , 100  @xmath1  @xmath9  @xmath1  300  k ; the particle density is then constrained using the @xmath5(c  ii@xmath39)/@xmath5(c  ii ) column density ratio , 30  @xmath1  @xmath10  @xmath1  50  @xmath11 ; and uv pumping is estimated , from the @xmath33  =  4 and 5 2 populations , to be of the same order as in our galaxy ( see srianand et al .",
    "2000 and srianand & petitjean 1998 for the derivation of these numbers ) .",
    "this shows that molecules are present even in gas with low metallicity and low depletion into dust grains .",
    "this is a consequence of moderately high local uv flux _ and _ low ( @xmath9  @xmath1  300  k ) temperature .",
    "two systems are at redshift close to the emission redshift of the quasar .",
    "they are real dla systems ( see wolfe & briggs 1981 , briggs et al .",
    "1984 for q  1157 + 014 and leibundgut & robertson 1999 for q  2059@xmath3360 ) .",
    "note that when peculiar velocity is taken into account , the systems with @xmath2  @xmath28  @xmath41 can be located far away from the quasar .",
    "moreover , out of the three systems where 2 is detected so far , one , toward q  0528@xmath3250 , has a redshift larger than the qso emission redshift .",
    "it is included in our sample because the measurement has been obtained from high spectral resolution data ( srianand & petitjean 1998 ) .",
    "we have searched the spectra for lines from the @xmath33  =  0 and @xmath33  =  1 rotational levels .",
    "we detect absorption from the @xmath33  =  1 level in none of the systems .",
    "we thus consider as an upper limit on the total 2 column density the sum of the ( tentative ) detection or upper limit for the @xmath33  =  0 level and the upper limit on the @xmath33  =  1 level .",
    "although , for typical physical conditions prevailing in such gas , the first two levels are the most populated , in principle , the higher @xmath33 levels can be populated as well .",
    "this implies an uncertainty on the upper limits of about a factor of two .",
    "recently , levshakov et al . (",
    "2000 ) have claimed the presence of 2 molecules in the @xmath2  =  3.3901 dla system toward q  0000@xmath3263 from the detection of a weak feature they identified as 2 l(4 - 0)r(1 ) .",
    "no other line is detected however and the probability that the feature be associated with another metal or lyman-@xmath0 line is high .",
    "we have therefore considered the measurement as an upper limit , @xmath5(2 )  @xmath1  10@xmath42  @xmath25 for t@xmath43  =  50  k.    we detect weak but consistent features at the redshifted positions of l(4 - 0)r0 and l(2 - 0)r0 at @xmath2  =  2.374 toward q  0841 + 129 . other detectable lines are blended .",
    "we tentatively derive @xmath5(2)(j=0 )  =  3.66@xmath310.9@xmath710@xmath44  @xmath25 .    due to incomplete wavelength coverage",
    ", we do not observe the lyman-@xmath0 line at @xmath2  =  3.171 toward q  1451 + 123 .",
    "lyman-@xmath0 damping wings are clearly seen in the intermediate resolution spectrum of bechtold ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use their equivalent width and derive log  @xmath5(h  i )  @xmath28  19.7 which is consistent with other lines of the lyman series present in our spectrum .",

    "ge & bechtold ( 1999 ) tentatively claimed a correlation between 2 abundance and relative heavy element depletion into dust grains as indicated by [ zn / cr ] ( zinc and chromium are assumed , respectively , undepleted and heavily depleted into dust grains as in our galaxy ) .",
