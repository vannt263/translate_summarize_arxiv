    "activity recognition represents a major research area within mobile and pervasive / ubiquitous computing @xcite .",
    "prominent examples of domains where activity recognition has been investigated include smart homes  @xcite , situated support  @xcite , automatic monitoring of mental and physical wellbeing  @xcite , and general health care  @xcite .",
    "modern smartphones with their advanced sensing capabilities provide a particularly attractive platform for activity recognition as they are carried around by many people while going about their everyday activities .",
    "the vast majority of activity recognition research relies on supervised learning techniques where handcrafted features , e.g. , heuristically chosen statistical measures , are extracted from raw sensor recordings , which are then combined with activity labels for effective classifier training . while this approach is in line with the standard procedures in many application domains of general pattern recognition and machine learning techniques  @xcite , it is often too costly or simply not applicable for ubiquitous / pervasive computing applications .",
    "the reasons for this are twofold .",
    "firstly , the performance of supervised learning approaches is highly sensitive to the type of feature extraction , where often the optimal set of features varies across different activities @xcite .",
    "secondly , and more crucially , obtaining reliable ground truth annotation for bootstrapping and training activity recognizers poses a challenge for system developers who target real - world deployments .",
    "people typically carry their mobile device while going about their everyday activities , thereby not paying much attention to the phone itself in terms of location of the device ( in the pocket , in the backpack , etc . ) and only sporadically interacting with it ( for making a call or explicitly using the device s services for , e.g. , information retrieval ) .",
    "consequently , active support from users to provide labels for data collected in real - life scenarios can not be considered feasible for many settings as prompting mobile phone users to annotate their activities while they are pursuing them has its limitations .",
    "apart from these limitations , privacy and ethical considerations typically render direct observation and annotation impracticable in realistic scenarios .",
    "possible alternatives to such direct observation and annotation include : _",
    "( i ) _ self - reporting of activities by the users , e.g. , using a diary  @xcite ; _ ( ii ) _ the use of experience sampling , i.e. , prompting the user and asking for the current or previous activity label  @xcite ; and _ ( iii ) _ a combination of these methods .",
    "while such techniques somewhat alleviate the aforementioned problem by providing annotation for at least smaller subsets of unlabeled data , they still remain prone to errors and typically can not replace expert ground truth annotation .",
    "whereas obtaining reliable ground truth annotation is hard to achieve , the collection of , even large amounts of , _ unlabeled _ sample data is typically straightforward .",
    "people s smartphones can simply record activity data in an opportunistic way , without requiring the user to follow a certain protocol or scripted activity patterns .",
    "this is especially attractive since it allows for capturing sensor data while users perform their natural activities without necessarily being conscious about the actual data collection .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a novel framework for activity recognition .",
    "our approach mitigates the requirement of large amounts of ground truth annotation by explicitly exploiting _ unlabeled _ sensor data for bootstrapping our recognition framework .",
    "based on the self - taught learning paradigm  @xcite , we develop a sparse - coding framework for unsupervised estimation of sensor data representations with the help of a _ codebook _ of basis vectors ( see section  [ sec : system : codebook ] ) .",
    "as these representations are learned in an unsupervised manner , our approach also overcomes the need to perform feature - engineering .",
    "while the original framework of self - taught learning has been developed mainly for the analysis of non - sequential data , i.e. , images and stationary audio signals  @xcite , we extend the approach towards time - series data such as continuous sensor data streams . we also develop a basis selection method that builds on information theory to generate a codebook of basis vectors that covers characteristic movement patterns in human physical activities . using _",
    "activations _ of these basis vectors ( see section  [ sec : system : fex_and_classifier_training ] ) we then compute features of the raw sensor data streams , which are the basis for subsequent classifier training .",
    "the latter requires only relatively small amounts of labeled data , which alleviates the ground truth annotation challenge of mobile computing applications .",
    "we demonstrate the benefits of our approach using data from two diverse activity recognition tasks , namely transportation mode analysis and classification of activities of daily living ( the opportunity challenge @xcite ) .",
    "our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better results than the state - of - the - art , namely pca- based feature learning , semi - supervised en - co - training , and feature - engineering based ( supervised ) algorithms , while requiring smaller amounts of training data and not relying on prior domain knowledge for feature crafting . apart from successful generalization across recognition tasks",
    ", we also demonstrate easy applicability of our proposed framework beyond modality boundaries covering not only accelerometer data but also other commonly available sensors on the mobile platform , such as the gyroscopes , or magnetometers .",
    "the focus of our work is on developing an effective framework that exploits unlabeled data to derive robust activity recognizers for mobile applications .",
    "the key idea is to use vast amounts of easy to record unlabeled sample data for unsupervised _",
    "feature learning_. these features shall cover general characteristics of human movements , which guarantees both robustness and generalizability .",
    "only very little related work exists that focus on incorporating unlabeled data for training mobile activity recognizers .",
    "a notable exception is the work by amft who explored self - taught learning in a very preliminary study for activity spotting using on - body motion sensors  @xcite .",
    "however , that work does not take into account the properties of the learned codebook which play an important role in the recognition task .",
    "the idea of incorporating unlabeled data and related feature learning techniques into recognizer training is a well researched area in the general machine learning and pattern recognition community . in the following",
    ", we will summarize relevant related work from these fields and link them to the mobile and ubiquitous computing domain .",
    "a number of general learning paradigms have been developed that focus on deriving statistical models and recognizers by incorporating unlabeled data .",
    "although differing in their particular approaches , all related techniques share the objective of alleviating the dependence on a large amount of annotated training data for parameter estimation .",
    "learning from a combination of labeled and unlabeled datasets is commonly known as _ semi - supervised learning _  @xcite .",
    "the most common approach to semi - supervised learning is _ generative models _ , where the unknown data distribution @xmath0 is modeled as a mixture of class conditional distributions @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ( unobserved ) class variable .",
    "the mixture components are estimated from a large amount of unlabeled and small amount of labeled data by applying the expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm .",
    "the predictive estimate of @xmath3 is then computed using bayes formula .",
    "other approaches to semi - supervised learning include _ self - training _ , _ co - training _ , _ transductive svm _",
    "( tsvm ) , _ graphical models _ and _ multiview learning_.    semi - supervised learning techniques have also been applied to activity recognition , e.g. , for recognizing locomotion related activities  @xcite , and in smart homes  @xcite . in order to be effective , semi - supervised learning approaches need to satisfy certain , rather strict assumptions  @xcite .",
    "probably the strongest constraint imposed by these techniques is that they assume that the unlabeled and labeled datasets are drawn from the same distribution , i.e. , @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "the unlabeled dataset has to be collected with strict focus on the set of activities the recognizer shall cover .",
    "this limits generalization capability and renders the learning error - prone for real - world settings where the user might perform extraneous activities , or no activity at all  @xcite .",
    "our approach provides improved generalization capability by relaxing the equality condition for the distributions of unlabeled and labeled datasets , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "an alternative approach to dealing with unlabeled data is _ active learning_. techniques for active learning aim to make the most economic use of annotations by identifying those unlabeled samples that are most uncertain and thus their annotation would provide most information for the training process .",
    "such samples are automatically identified using information theoretic criteria and then manual annotation is requested .",
    "active learning approaches have become very popular in a number of application domains including activity recognition using body - worn sensors  @xcite .",
    "active learning operates on pre - defined sets of features , which stands in contrast to our approach that automatically learns feature representations . in doing so , active learning becomes sensitive to the particular features that have been extracted , hence limiting its generalizability .",
    "explicitly focusing on generalizability of recognition frameworks , _ transfer learning",
    "_ techniques have been developed to bridge , e.g. , application domains with differing classes or sensing modalities  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", knowledge acquired in a specific domain can be transferred to another , if a systematic transformation is either provided or learned automatically .",
    "transfer learning has been applied to ubiquitous computing problems , for example , for adapting models learned with data from one smart home to work within another smart home  @xcite , or to adapt activity classifiers learned with data from one user to work with other users  @xcite . in these approaches",
    "the need for annotated training data is not directly reduced but shifted to other domains or modalities , which can be beneficial if such data are easier to obtain .    as an alternative approach to alleviating the demands of ground truth annotation so - called _ multi - instance learning _",
    "techniques have been developed .",
    "these techniques assign labels to sets of instances instead of individual data points  @xcite . multi - instance learning has also been applied for activity recognition tasks in ubiquitous computing settings  @xcite . to apply multi - instance learning ,",
    "labels of the individual instances were considered as hidden variables and a support vector machine was trained to minimize the expected loss of the classification of instances using the labels of the instance sets .",
    "multi - instance learning also operates on a predefined set of features and therefore has limited generalizability .      exploiting unlabeled data",
    "can also be applied at the feature level to derive a compact and meaningful representation of raw input data .",
    "in fact , feature learning , i.e. , unsupervised estimation of suitable data representations , has been actively researched in the machine learning community  @xcite .",
    "the goal of feature learning is to identify and model interesting regularities in the sensor data without being driven by class information .",
    "the majority of methods rely on a process similar to generative models but employ efficient , approximative learning algorithms instead of em  @xcite .",
    "data representations for activity recognition in the ubiquitous or mobile computing domain typically correspond to some sort of `` engineered '' feature sets , e.g. , statistical values calculated over analysis windows that are extracted using a sliding window procedure  @xcite .",
    "such predefined features often do not generalize across domain boundaries , which requires system developers to optimize their data representation virtually from scratch for every new application domain .",
    "only recently , concepts of feature learning have been successfully applied for activity recognition tasks .",
    "for example , mntyjrvi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite compared the use of principal component analysis ( pca ) and independent component analysis ( ica ) for extracting features from sensor data . in their approach , either pca or ica was applied on raw sensor values .",
    "a sliding window was then applied on the transformed data and a wavelet - based feature extraction method was used in combination with a multilayer perceptron .",
    "similarly , pltz _ et al .",
    "_  employed principal component analysis to derive features from tri - axial accelerometer data using a sliding window approach  @xcite",
    ". however , instead of applying the pca on the raw sensor values , they used the empirical cumulative distribution of a data frame to represent the signals before applying pca @xcite .",
    "moreover , they investigated the use of restricted boltzmann machines  @xcite , to train an autoencoder network for feature learning .",
    "minnen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered activities as sparse motifs in multidimensional time series and proposed an unsupervised algorithm for automatically extracting such motifs from data .",
    "a related approach was proposed by frank _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who used time - delay embeddings to extract features from windowed data and fed these features to a subsequent classifier .",
    "contrary to the popular fourier and wavelet representations , which suffer from non - adaptability to the particular dataset  @xcite , we employ a data - adaptive approach of representing accelerometer measurements .",
    "the data - adaptive representation is tailored to the statistics of the data and is directly learned from the recorded measurements .",
    "examples of data - adaptive methods include pca , ica and matrix factorization .",
    "our approach differs from common data - adaptive methods by employing an _ over - complete _ and sparse feature representation technique . here",
    ", over - completeness indicates that the dimension of the feature space is much higher than the original input data dimension , and sparsity indicates that the majority of the elements in a feature vector is zero .",
    "we propose a sparse - coding framework for activity recognition that uses a codebook of basis vectors that capture characteristic and latent patterns in the sensor data . as the codebook learning is unsupervised and operates on unlabeled data , our approach effectively reduces the need for annotated ground truth data and overcomes the need to use predefined feature representations , rendering our approach well suited for continuous activity recognition tasks under naturalistic settings .",
    "figure  [ fig : framework ] gives an overview of our approach to learning activity recognizers .",
    "we first collect unlabeled data , which in our experiments consists mainly of tri - axial accelerometer measurements ( upper part of figure  [ fig : framework:1st ] ) .",
    "we then solve an optimization problem ( see section  [ sec : system : codebook ] ) to learn a set of basis vectors  _ the codebook _  that capture characteristic patterns of human movements as they can be observed from the raw sensor data ( lower part of figure  [ fig : framework:1st ] ) .",
    "once the codebook has been learned , we use a small set of labeled data to train an activity classifier ( figure  [ fig : subfig2 ] ) .",
    "the features that are used for training the classifier correspond to so - called _ activations _ , which are vectors that enable transferring sensor readings to the feature space spanned by the basis vectors in the codebook .",
    "after model training , the activity label for new sensor readings can be determined by transferring the corresponding measurements into the same feature space and applying the learned classifier .",
    "we consider sequential , multidimensional sensor data , which in our experiments correspond to measurements from a tri - axial accelerometer or a gyroscope .",
    "we apply a sliding window procedure on the measurements to extract overlapping , fixed length frames .",
    "specifically , we consider measurements of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a vector containing all measurements within the @xmath8 frame and @xmath9 is the length of the frame , i.e. , the unlabeled measurements are represented as the set @xmath10    in the first step of our approach , we use the unlabeled data @xmath11 to learn a codebook @xmath12 that captures latent and characteristic patterns in the sensor measurements .",
    "the codebook consists of @xmath13 basis vectors @xmath14 , where each basis vector @xmath15 represents a particular pattern in the data .",
    "once the codebook has been learned , any frame of sensor measurements can be represented as a linear superposition of the basis vectors , i.e. , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the activation for @xmath18 basis vector when representing the measurement vector @xmath7 ; see figure  [ fig : reconstruction ] for an illustration .",
    "the task of learning the codebook @xmath19 from unlabeled data @xmath11 can be formulated as a regularized optimization problem ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , we obtain the codebook as the optimal solution to the following minimization problem : @xmath20 equation  [ eq : optimization ] contains two optimization variables : ( i ) the codebook @xmath12 ; and ( ii ) the activations @xmath21 . the regularization parameter @xmath22 controls the trade - off between reconstruction quality and sparseness of the basis vectors .",
    "smaller values of @xmath22 lead to the first term , i.e. , the quadratic term in equation  [ eq : optimization ] , dominating , thereby generating basis vectors whose weighted combination can represent input signals accurately .",
    "in contrast , large values ( e.g. , @xmath23 ) shift the importance towards the regularization term , thereby encouraging sparse solutions where the activations have small @xmath24-norm , i.e. , the input signal is represented using only a few basis vectors .",
    "the constraint on the norm of each basis vector @xmath25 is essential to avoid trivial solutions , e.g. , very large @xmath25 and very small activations @xmath26",
    "note that equation [ eq : optimization ] does not pose any restrictions on the number of basis vectors @xmath13 that can be learned .",
    "in fact , the codebook can be over - complete , i.e. , containing more basis vectors than the input data dimension ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) .",
    "over - completeness reduces sensitivity to noise , whereas the application of sparse - coding enables deviating from a purely linear relationship between the input and output , enabling the codebook to capture complex and high - order patterns in the data  @xcite .",
    "the minimization problem specified in equation  [ eq : optimization ] is not convex on both @xmath12 and @xmath28 simultaneously .",
    "however , it can easily be divided into two convex sub - problems , which allows for iterative optimization of both @xmath12 and @xmath28 , thereby keeping one variable constant while optimizing the other .",
    "effectively this corresponds to solving a l@xmath29-constrained least squares problem while optimizing for @xmath12 keeping @xmath28 constant , followed by optimizing @xmath28 whilst keeping @xmath12 constant , i.e. , solving an l@xmath30-regularized least square problem  @xcite . the solution to the optimization problem , specifically in the case of a large dataset and highly over - complete representation , is computationally expensive  @xcite .",

    "algorithm  [ alg : codebook ] summarizes the procedure , where the featuresignsearch algorithm ( line [ fsign ] ) solves the l@xmath30-regularized least square problem ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the codebook is derived by using standard least square optimization ( line [ lagrange ] ) .",
    "the convergence of the algorithm is detected when the drop in the objective function given in equation  [ eq : optimization ] is insignificant between two successive iterations .",

    "the activations are now @xmath46 dimensional vectors , i.e. , @xmath47 , and the measurements are represented using a convolution of activations and basis vectors , i.e. , @xmath48 . however , this approach is computationally intensive , rendering it unsuitable to mobile devices . instead of modifying the optimization equation itself ,",
    "we have developed a basis vector selection technique based on an information theoretic criterion .",
    "the selection procedure reduces redundancy by removing specific basis vectors that are structurally similar .    in the first step of our codebook selection technique ,",
    "we employ a hierarchical clustering of the basis vectors .",
    "more specifically , we use the complete linkage clustering algorithm  @xcite with maximal cross - correlation as the similarity measure between two basis vectors : @xmath49 the clustering returns a hierarchical representation of the similarity relationships between the basis vectors . from this hierarchy , we then select a subset of basis vectors that contains most of the information . in order to do so , we first apply an adaptive cutoff threshold on the hierarchy to divide the basis vectors into @xmath50 clusters . for illustration ,",
    "figure  [ fig : dendrogram ] shows the dendrogram plot of the hierarchical relationships found within a codebook of @xmath51 basis vectors .",
    "the red line in the figure indicates the cutoff threshold ( @xmath52 ) used to divide the basis vectors into @xmath53 clusters .",
    "next , we remove from each cluster those basis vectors that are not sufficiently informative .",
    "specifically , we order the basis vectors within a cluster by their empirical entropy , where @xmath54 is the probability of the @xmath55 histogram bin . ] and discard the lowest 10-percentile of vectors .",
    "the basis vectors that remain after this step constitute the final codebook @xmath56 used by our approach .",

    "once the codebook has been learned , we use a small set of labeled data to train a classifier that can be used to determine the appropriate activity label for new sensor readings .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the set of measurement frames for which ground truth labels are available and let @xmath58 denote the corresponding activity labels . to train the classifier , we first map the measurements in the labeled dataset to the feature space spanned by the basis vectors .",
    "specifically , we need to derive the optimal activation vector @xmath59 for the measurement @xmath60 , which corresponds to solving the following optimization equation : @xmath61 once the activation vectors @xmath59 have been calculated , a supervised classifier is learned using the activation vectors as features and the labels @xmath62 as the class information , i.e. , the training data consists of tuples @xmath63 .",
    "the classifier is learned using standard supervised learning techniques . in our experiments we consider decision trees , nearest - neighbor , and support vector machines ( svm ) as the classifiers ; however , our approach is generic and any other classification technique can be used .    to determine the activity label for a new measurement frame @xmath64",
    ", we first map the measurement onto the feature space specified by the basis vectors in the codebook , i.e. , we use equation  [ feature ] to obtain the activation vector @xmath65 for @xmath64 . the current activity label",
    "can then be determined by giving the activation vector @xmath65 as input to the previously trained classifier .",
    "the codebook selection procedure based on hierarchical clustering also helps to improve the running time of above optimization problem while extracting feature vectors and therefore suits well for mobile platforms .",

    "in order to study the effectiveness of the proposed sparse - coding framework for activity recognition , we conducted an extensive case study on transportation mode analysis .",
    "we utilized smartphones and their onboard sensing capabilities ( tri - axial accelerometers ) as mobile recording platform to capture people s movement patterns and then use our new activity recognition method to detect the transportation modes of the participants in their everyday life , e.g. , walking , taking the metro and riding the bus .",
    "knowledge of transportation mode has relevance to numerous fields , including human mobility modeling  @xcite , inferring transportation routines and predicting future movements  @xcite , urban planning  @xcite , and emergency response , to name but a few  @xcite .",
    "it is considered as a representative example of mobile computing applications @xcite .",
    "gathering accurate annotations for transportation mode detection is difficult as the activities take place in everyday situations where environmental factors , such as crowding , can rapidly influence a person s behavior .",
    "transportation activities are also often interleaved and difficult to distinguish ( e.g. , a person walking in a moving bus on a bumpy road ) .",
    "furthermore , people often interact with their phones while moving , which adds another level of interference and noise to the recorded signals .",
    "the state - of - the - art in transportation mode detection largely corresponds to feature - engineering based approaches  @xcite , which we will use as a baseline for our evaluation .      for the case study",

    "we also include the same cross - validation results as obtained using pca based feature learning with ecdf normalization ( section  [ sssec : pca ] ) .",
    "additionally we include the performance of a feature - engineering method using the feature set proposed by pltz _",

    "the mcnemar tests prove that improvements by sparse - coding are statistically significant ( @xmath95 , each ) for all three sensor configurations .",
    "when focusing on ubiquitous computing applications ( especially using mobile devices ) , computational requirements play a non - negligible role in system design .",
    "consequently , we now discuss some practical aspects of our sparse - coding framework for activity recognition .",
    "the most time - consuming part of our approach is the construction of the codebook , i.e. , the extraction of the basis vectors .",
    "the time that is needed for constructing the codebook depends , among other things , on the size of the unlabeled dataset , the number of basis vectors , the sparsity requirement , and the dimensionality of data , i.e. , the length of the data windows .",
    "the second most time - consuming task is the training of the supervised classifier using the labeled dataset .",
    "however , there is no need to perform either of these tasks on the mobile device as _ online recognition _ of activities is possible as long as the codebook and the trained classifier are transferred to the mobile device from remote servers or cloud .",
    "the most computationally intensive task that needs to be performed on the mobile device during online recognition is the mapping of measurements onto the basis vectors , i.e. , the optimization task specified by equation  [ feature ] . to demonstrate the feasibility of using our framework on mobile devices , we have carried out an experiment where we measured the runtime of the feature extraction using a dataset consisting of @xmath96 frames and with varying codebook sizes .",
    "the results of this evaluation are shown in figure  [ runtime ] . as expected , the runtime increases as the size of the codebook increases .",
    "this increase is linear in the number of basis vectors , with the pruning of basis vectors further reducing the runtime .",
    "the total time that is needed to run the feature extraction for @xmath96 frames is under @xmath97 milliseconds ( evaluated on a standard desktop pc , solely for the sake of standardized validation experiments ) for a codebook consisting of @xmath98 basis vectors . with the computational power of contemporary smartphones ( such as the samsung galaxy sii , which was used for data collection in the transportation mode task )",
    "the sparse - coding based approach is feasible for recognition rates of up to @xmath99 hz with moderately large codebooks and frame lengths ( @xmath100s ) .",
    "this performance is sufficient for typical activity analysis tasks  @xcite .",
    "ubiquitous computing opens up many possibilities for activity recognition using miniaturized sensing and smart data analysis .",
    "however , especially for real - world deployments the acquisition of ground truth annotation of activities of interest can be challenging , as activities might be sporadic and not accessible to well controlled , protocol driven studies in a naturalistic and hence representable manner .",
    "the acquisition of ground truth annotation in these problem settings is resource consuming and therefore often limited .",
    "this limited access to labeled data renders typical supervised approaches to automatic recognition challenging and often ineffective .",
    "in contrast , the acquisition of unlabeled data is not limited by such constraints .",
    "for example , it is straightforward to equip people with recording devices  most prominently smartphones  without the need for them to follow any particular protocol beyond very basic instructions .",
    "however , typical heuristic , i.e.  hand - crafted , approaches to recognition common in this field are unable to exploit this vast pool of data and are therefore inherently limited .",
    "we have presented a sparse - coding based framework for human activity recognition with specific but not exclusive focus on mobile computing applications . in a case study on transportation mode analysis we detailed the effectiveness of the proposed approach .",
    "our sparse - coding technique outperformed state - of - the - art approaches to activity recognition .",
    "we effectively demonstrated that even with limited availability of labeled data , recognition performance of the proposed system massively benefits from unlabeled resources , far beyond its impact on comparable approaches such as pca .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed approach by evaluating it on a different domain and sensor modalities , namely the analysis of activities of daily living .",
    "our approach outperforms the analyzed state - of - the - art in the opportunity @xcite challenge . with a view on mobile computing applications",
    "we have shown that  even if computationally intensive  inference is feasible on modern , hand - held devices , thus opening this type of approach for mobile applications .",

    "<S> we propose a sparse - coding framework for activity recognition in ubiquitous and mobile computing that alleviates two fundamental problems of current supervised learning approaches . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ it automatically derives a compact , sparse and meaningful feature representation of sensor data that does not rely on prior expert knowledge and generalizes well across domain boundaries . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ it exploits unlabeled sample data for bootstrapping effective activity recognizers , i.e. , substantially reduces the amount of ground truth annotation required for model estimation . </S>",
    "<S> such unlabeled data is easy to obtain , e.g. , through contemporary smartphones carried by users as they go about their everyday activities .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the self - taught learning paradigm we automatically derive an over - complete set of basis vectors from unlabeled data that captures inherent patterns present within activity data . through projecting raw sensor data onto the feature space defined by such over - complete sets of basis vectors </S>",
    "<S> effective feature extraction is pursued . </S>",
    "<S> given these learned feature representations , classification backends are then trained using small amounts of labeled training data .    </S>",
    "<S> we study the new approach in detail using two datasets which differ in terms of the recognition tasks and sensor modalities . </S>",
    "<S> primarily we focus on a transportation mode analysis task , a popular task in mobile - phone based sensing . </S>",
    "<S> the sparse - coding framework demonstrates better performance than the state - of - the - art in supervised learning approaches . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we show the practical potential of the new approach by successfully evaluating its generalization capabilities across both domain and sensor modalities by considering the popular opportunity dataset . </S>",
    "<S> our feature learning approach outperforms state - of - the - art approaches to analyzing activities of daily living .    </S>",
