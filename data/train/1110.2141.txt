    "the  experiment at slac s 2  ran from 2000 - 2008 measuring the products of asymmetric @xmath11 collisions . during this time , it gathered a dataset consisting of 432.89at a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy equal to the 4s mass .",
    "in addition , data were taken at the 3s and 2s resonances , as well as cm energy points below each resonance .",
    "finally , in 2008 a scan was performed covering the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath12 ) region from 10.54@xmath13to 11.20@xmath13 in 5@xmath14steps , followed by additional running at points spread around the @xmath15 peak .",
    "a detailed description of the  detector can be found in ref .",
    "tracking of charged particles is provided by the combination of an inner , five - layer silicon tracker ( svt ) and an outer , 40-layer drift chamber ( dch ) .",
    "momentum information is provided by the use of a 1.5-tesla solenoidal magnetic field surrounding the tracking subdetectors .",
    "photon and electron energy measurements are provided by a csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "charged particle identification at  is achieved using a likelihood - based approach combining specific ionization ( @xmath16 ) measurements from the dch and svt , energy deposition in a @xmath17 electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) , and measurements of cherenkov radiation produced in the detector of internally - reflected cherenkov light ( dirc ) . an instrumented flux return ( ifr )",
    "provides additional information for discriminating @xmath18 from @xmath19 .",
    "semileptonic decays of @xmath21 mesons provide a valuable probe of the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "lepton universality in the standard model means that differences in the semileptonic branching fractions to @xmath22 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 arise only through the mass splitting among the three .",
    "therefore , deviations from the predicted ratios of branching fractions would be a sign of new physics .",
    "however , due to their more complicated nature , @xmath21 semileptonic decays to @xmath23 are not as precisely measured as those to @xmath22 or @xmath18 .",
    "the first study presented here is an update of the  measurement of exclusive @xmath21 decays to @xmath24 , with improvements in both the size of the dataset used and the efficiency of the selection relative to the previous  measurement @xcite .",
    "the variable used to study these semileptonic decays to @xmath23 is the ratio of the semileptonic branching fraction to @xmath23 to the branching fraction to the light leptons @xmath25 @xmath26 which is both theoretically well - controlled and allows for certain experimental systematic uncertainties to cancel in the ratio .",
    "standard model predictions predictions for this quantity are given in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this quantity is potentially quite sensitive to charged currents induced by new physics , for example the existence of an extra higgs doublet @xcite .      for this measurement , events with a single well - identified @xmath22 or @xmath18 candidate",
    "are selected .",
    "the rest of the tracks in the event are used to reconstruct a @xmath21 and a @xmath29 candidate .",
    "the @xmath21 candidate , referred to as the  tag \" @xmath21 , is reconstructed in the event from one of over 1000 possible hadronic decay modes , constraining all the daughter tracks to come from the event s primary vertex . for each @xmath30 candidate ,",
    "the following quantities are used to suppress combinatoric backgrounds : the difference of the reconstructed @xmath21 energy and the beam energy in the center of mass , and the mass of the @xmath21 candidate calculated using the known collision energy @xmath31 for this measurement , @xmath30 candidates are required to satisfy @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the remaining tracks in the event are used to form a @xmath5 candidate decaying via @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 where @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "if possible , @xmath2 candidates are reconstructed via @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath2 reconstructions involve updating the fit of their daughter tracks using the added constraint that their masses be equal to the world average values @xcite .",
    "this improves the resolution on the missing energy and momentum in the event .    in cases where an event may be reconstructed in more than one way ,",
    "one of the possibilities is chosen by the use of extra energy deposited in the calorimeter .",
    "the extra energy in an event is defined as scalar sum of the energy deposited in the emc that is both isolated from any charged tracks and not used as a photon candidate in the reconstruction of the @xmath21 or @xmath2 .",
    "the reconstruction which minimizes this quantity is selected , while the others are discarded .",
    "the final part of the reconstruction is the construction of a @xmath44 control sample .",
    "unused photon candidates in the emc are combined to form @xmath45 candidates .",
    "valid @xmath45 candidates are required to have an invariant mass between 120@xmath14and 150@xmath14 .",
    "events with these @xmath45 candidates are used to estimate the background coming from @xmath21 decays to highly excited charm states , which subsequently feed - down into the @xmath5 or @xmath2 samples due to errors in reconstruction and limited detector acceptance .",
    "semileptonic decays to @xmath23 are distinguished by examining the kinematics of the lepton candidate and the missing energy and momentum in the event .",
    "the true value of the variable @xmath46 is bounded from below by @xmath47 , so requiring @xmath48 removes much of the background from semileptonic decays to @xmath22 and @xmath18 .",
    "backgrounds in this measurement are further controlled by the use of four multivariate selectors , trained to discriminate signal events against @xmath49 , continuum , and charge - crossfeed backgrounds in the four signal samples .",
    "eight additional selectors are used to remove background in the four @xmath50 samples , with one selectors for each channel trained against background from other semileptonic decays and one trained against @xmath49 combinatoric background .      the result is extracted using a two - dimensional fit in the variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively the momentum of the lepton in the center - of - mass frame and the invariant mass of the missing energy and momentum in the event .",
    "the fit is performed simultaneously on eight data samples : four signal @xmath53 samples and four @xmath50 samples .",
    "signal and background shapes are taken from simulation using non - parametric kernel estimators @xcite .",
    "the relative normalization of background from charge - crossfeed and continuum events are fixed using simulation in all samples .",
    "the background is fixed in the signal and normalization samples , but not the @xmath50 samples .",
    "simulation is used to create constraints between the various samples , for example the yield of @xmath54 events determines the amount of @xmath54 feed - down into the @xmath5 sample .",
    "these constraints are used for all such yields except for the feed - down of @xmath55 into @xmath5 , which is left floating due to the very high statistics in this channel .",
    "this leaves 22 free parameters in the fit : the primary yield in each sample ( i.e. @xmath56 or @xmath57 in the @xmath5 sample ) ( twelve parameters ) , the background in the four @xmath50 samples ( four parameters ) , and the two @xmath55 feed - down yields already mentioned .",
    "in addition to the 22 parameter fit ( referred to as the _ unconstrained fit _ ) , a separate fit is performed in which the yields of the charged and neutral @xmath29 components are constrained using known isospin relations in the decays of charged and neutral @xmath21 mesons .",
    "isospin constrained fit _ has 13 free parameters .",
    "the unconstrained fit is shown with the normalization region projected in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] and the signal region in [ fig : sig ] .",
    "the preliminary results are summarized in table [ tab : tauresult ] .",
    "both the @xmath5 and @xmath2 are consistent with the standard model expectation at the level of 1.8 standard deviations .",
