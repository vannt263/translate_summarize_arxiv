    "conclusive observational evidences from supernovae luminosity distances @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite indicate that our universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion . understanding the nature of this cosmic acceleration is one of the greatest challenges in contemporary physics .",
    "theoretically , the leading explanation to it is a cosmological constant in the context of general relativity ( gr ) . despite its notable success in describing the current cosmological data sets",
    ", this standard paradigm suffers from several problems : the measured value of the cosmological constant is far smaller than the prediction of the quantum field theory and there is a coincidence problem as to why the energy densities of matter and the vacuum energy are of the same order today ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "it is also possible to explain the acceleration as driven by a mysterious component called dark energy , which is some kind of dynamical fluid with negative and time - dependent equation of state @xmath8 .",
    "however , to understand the nature of the dynamical dark energy is even harder than that of the cosmological constant in fundamental physics .    on the other hand , modified gravity theories are proposed as a promising alternative at explaining the observed accelerating expansion of our universe .",
    "the idea is that gr might not be accurate on cosmological scales , and that the universe may obey a different law of gravity .",
    "one of the simplest attempts is the so - called @xmath0 gravity , in which the ricci curvature @xmath9 in the einstein - hilbert action of gr is replaced by an arbitrary function of @xmath9 in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this model introduces an extra scalar degree of freedom which enables it to reproduce the accelerating expansion history of the universe with any effective dark energy equation of state @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , any specifically designed @xmath8 other than @xmath10 is less interesting because it can hardly be well - motivated in fundamental physics given the fact that we are still lack of knowledge about the nature of dark energy at the moment , and the observations do seem to favour @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , it is of particular interest to investigate the family of @xmath0 models that can exactly reproduce the @xmath1cdm background expansion history .",
    "the motivation behind this is threefold .",
    "first , this family of @xmath0 models can only be distinguished from the standard @xmath1cdm model in the perturbed space time , and any deviations from the @xmath1cdm growth history are direct consequences of the extra degree of freedom . this family of models can be considered as an ideal benchmark for testing the existence of scalar degrees of freedom in general modified gravity theories .",
    "second , the brans - dicke theory @xcite and general coupled dark energy models @xcite in the einstein frame are equivalent to @xmath0 gravity in the jordan frame through conformal transformations as long as the distribution of the scalar curvature @xmath9 is continuous .",
    "this equivalence is rigorous in mathematics @xcite and can also be well explained in physics @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 gravity is not simply a stand - alone gravity theory but an equivalent representation for a wide class of modified gravity theories which involve extra scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "third , this family of @xmath0 models do have the well - defined lagrangian formalism in the spatially flat universe @xcite , which is valid for the whole expansion history of the universe from the past to the future .",
    "the model is no longer simply a phenomenological model .",
    "the field equations can be deduced from the fundamental principle of least action . moreover ,",
    "the model has only one more extra parameter than that of the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "because of the importance of this specific family of @xmath0 models , in this paper , we will further investigate the impact of the extra scalar degree of freedom on the large - scale structure in both the linear and the non - linear regimes using @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "we will first review the linear power spectrum for a large portion of parameter space using a modified version of camb code @xcite and address the importance of the chameleon mechanism @xcite for @xmath0 gravity to evade local tests of gravity .",
    "then we will implement a large suite of @xmath2-body simulations based on ecosmog code @xcite to examine the non - linear effect on the matter power spectrum of our @xmath0 model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] , we describe the details and summarize the distinct features of our @xmath0 model . in section  [ linear ] , we review the linear power spectrum of the model using accurate numerical results . in section  [ nonlinear ] , we examine the non - linear power spectrum using a large suite of @xmath2-body simulations , and discuss the chameleon effect in our model . in section  [ conclusions ] , we summarize and conclude this work .",

    "no matter how small we choose the parameter @xmath73 , there is a factor of @xmath74 enhancement in the effective newtonian constant as @xmath75 trends to infinity , @xmath76 and this is known as `` scalar - tensor '' @xcite or equivalently `` low - curvature '' @xcite regime . the curvature @xmath77 is well suppressed and no longer tracks the matter density field ( as it does in gr ) .",
    "the enhancement in the effective newtonian constant @xmath69 could render @xmath0 gravity models unable to pass the local tests . on the other hand , this enhancement would also increase the linear power of matter in @xmath0 gravity on the smallest scales at present time compared to the @xmath1cdm model . as a result , the ratio @xmath78 in fig .",

    "the ratio of the matter power spectrum , therefore , is @xmath84 which is scale - independent and only depends on the initial conditions .",

    "we have also generalized the ppf fitting formula @xcite to fit our simulation results , and the new fitting formula works very well for individual @xmath0 models .",
    "however , it is still challenging to find a single formula which could fit well for all these models at different redshifts , due to the scale - dependent growth history and the chameleon effect .",
    "finally , it is very important to note that even in the model with @xmath4 where the chameleon mechanism could work efficiently in the dense regions and there are no significant signatures in the matter power spectra , in low density regions where @xmath171 or in voids where @xmath172 , the compton condition @xcite is violated and the strength of the gravity could substantially differ from the gr result , which provides a smoking gun for testing the modified gravity theories , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to investigate the halo and void properties in our @xmath0 model , and this will be a subject for future work .    _",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the non - linear matter power spectrum in a specific family of @xmath0 models that can reproduce the @xmath1cdm background expansion history , using high resolution @xmath2-body simulations based on the ecosmog code . </S>",

    "<S> we also examine the chameleon mechanism for our models and find that it works throughout the cosmic history in dense regions , for our @xmath0 models with @xmath4 . on the other hand , for models with @xmath5 , we find no chameleon screening in dense regions at late times ( @xmath6 ) , which means that those models could be ruled out due to the factor - of-@xmath7 enhancement to the strength of newtonian gravity . </S>",
