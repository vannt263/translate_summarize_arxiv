    "[ section - introduction ]    recent improvements in multidisciplinary methods and , particularly , the availability of powerful computational tools are giving researchers an ever greater opportunity to investigate societies in their complex nature .",
    "the adoption of a complex systems approach allows the modeling of macro  sociological or economic structures from a bottom  up perspective  understood as resulting from the repeated local interaction of socio  economic agents  without disregarding the consequences of the structures themselves on individual behavior , emergence of interaction patterns and social welfare .",
    "agent based models ( abm ) are at the leading edge of this endeavor . when designing an agent model , one is inevitably faced with the problem of finding an acceptable compromise between realism and simplicity .",
    "if many aspects are included into the agent description , the model might be plausible with regard to the individual behaviors , but it will be impossible to derive rigorous analytical results .",
    "in fact , it can even be very hard to perform systematic computations to understand the model dynamics if many parameters and rules are included .",
    "on the other hand , models that allow for an analytical treatment often oversimplify the problem at hand . in abm",
    ", we can find the whole spectrum between these two extremes .",
    "while simplicity is often favored by physicists in order to be able to apply their well  developed tools from statistical physics , more realistic descriptions are often desired by researchers in the humanities because they are interested in incorporating into the model a reasonable part of their qualitative knowledge at the micro and macro scales .",
    "both views have , of course , their own merits .",
    "our paper is a contribution to interweaving two lines of research that have developed in almost separate ways : the markov chain approach and abms .",
    "the former represents the simplest form of a stochastic process while the latter puts a strong emphasis on heterogeneity and social interactions .",
    "the main expected output of our markov chain strategy applied to abm is a better understanding of the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic dynamical properties .",
    "moreover , we aim to contribute not only to the understanding of the asymptotic properties of abm but also to the transient mechanisms that rule the system on intermediate time scales . for practical purposes",
    "this is the most relevant information for two reasons : first , in our case the chains are absorbing , so the asymptotic dynamics is trivial and second , they describe the evolution of the system before external perturbations take place and possibly throw it into a new setting",
    ".    agent  based opinion models , a particular case of abm , are among the most simple models in the literature and are therefore a suitable starting point for the analysis . especially for _ binary opinion models _",
    "several results have been obtained by previous authors using analytical tools , as shown in the review on social dynamics by castellano and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the most intensively studied model is the _ voter model _ , originally developed by kimura and weiss @xcite as a model for spatial conflict of two species ( see also refs .",
    "the analysis of binary opinion models is usually based on mean  field arguments .",
    "the microscopic agent configuration is mapped onto an aggregate order parameter , and the system is reformulated on the macro  scale as a differential equation which describes the temporal evolution of that parameter .",
    "a mean  field analysis for the voter model on the complete graph was presented by slanina and lavicka in ref .",
    "@xcite , and naturally , we come across the same results using our method as the first part of approach .",
    "slanina and lavicka derive expressions for the asymptotic exit probabilities and the mean time needed to converge , but the partial differential equations that describe the full probability distribution for the time to reach the stationary state is too difficult to be solved analytically ( @xcite , pag.4 ) .",
    "analytical results based on the same methods have been obtained for the voter model on @xmath4dimensional lattices ( @xcite ) as well as for networks with uncorrelated degree distributions ( @xcite ) .",
    "one step to a more realistic agent description ( though still a caricature ) is achieved by allowing the agents to make n  ary choices . among the most popular models that realize",
    "this is the axelrod model @xcite , which uses vectors as state variables and bounded confidence ( @xcite ) . in both models ,",
    "the interaction probability is a function of the agent similarity such that similar agents tend to interact and so become more similar in the interaction . in the axelrod model as well as in",
    "other bounded confidence models , this leads to the emergence of clustering as agents converge in homogeneous subgroups while an appropriate distance in between these subgroups increases .",
    "an analytical treatment of this process is already quite difficult ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an approximate mean  field analysis ) .",
    "our markov chain approach shows how restrictions in the agent communication lead to the emergence of new absorbing states in the associated markov chain which correspond to system states where different opinions co  exist .",
    "the usefulness of the markov chain formalism in the analysis of more sophisticated abms has been discussed by izquierdo and co - workers ( @xcite ) , who look at 10 well  known social simulation models by representing them as a time  homogeneous markov chain . among these models",
    "are the schelling segregation model ( @xcite , for which some analytical results are available , for example , in refs.@xcite ) , the axelrod model ( considered above ) and the sugarscape model from epstein and axtell @xcite .",
    "the main idea of izquierdo and co - workers @xcite is to consider all possible configurations of the system as the state space of the markov chain .",
    "despite the fact that all the information of the dynamics on the abm is encoded in a markov chain , it is difficult to learn directly from this fact , due to the huge dimension of the configuration space and its corresponding markov transition matrix .",
    "the work of izquierdo and co - workers mainly relies on numerical computations to estimate the stochastic transition matrices of the models .    in our opinion , a well posed mathematical basis for these models may help the understanding of many of their observed properties . linking the micro",
    " description of an abm to a macro  description in the form of a markov chain provides information about the transition from the interaction of individual actors to the complex macroscopic behaviors observed in social systems .",
    "in particular , well known conditions for lumpability make it possible to decide whether the macro model is still markov .",
    "conversely , this setting can also provide a suitable framework to understand the emergence of long range memory effects .    in sociology ,",
    "the concepts of micro and macro have long been an important subject of analysis . different but related meanings have been advocated by different authors ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) , running from `` micro as dealing with individuals and macro as dealing with populations '' to `` micro as social processes that engender relations among individuals and macro as the structure of different positions in a population and their constraints on interaction '' . in any case",
    "the terms micro and macro relate in this context the action of individuals or small groups based on their mutual relations and the emergence of collective societal scopes .",
    "one of the first acknowledged synthetic formulations of this linkage between micro and macro in sociology studies is from max weber ( @xcite , pag.29 ) from where we quote the following basic observation : `` within the realm of social action , certain empirical uniformities can be observed , that is , courses of action that are repeated by the actor or ( simultaneously ) occur among numerous actors ''",
    ". we shall see how a stylized version of this belief is incorporated in our study when passing from micro to macro dynamics .",
    "talcott parsons @xcite later introduced the notion of internalization , posing an interesting question on the retroaction of the macro on the micro level of the models , to which we shall come back in section [ section - projected ] .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this topic .    on the other hand our work is certainly related to the social network literature , another old outstanding branch of sociology .",
    "sociograms , an important tool in social studies , had already been introduced by jacob levy moreno in the 30s , ( @xcite , @xcite ) inducing a graph representation of social relations , thus opening the way to social network based research .",
    "this approach has been developed since the seminal studies of john barnes @xcite and it expanded rapidly with the work of mark granovetter @xcite and many others . in our case , however , as in plenty of other models the emphasis is on the dynamics of the processes rather than on the structure alone ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the key notions to understand the micro ",
    "macro linkage is emergence .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite to describe various levels of emergence present in the sociological literature and comment on the links with our work .",
    "first the so called _ descriptive emergence _ problem : are `` the macroproperties a common property of many microunits '' or are they something fundamentally different ?",
    "this question is clearly addressed in our work .",
    "in fact , starting from a `` simple aggregative procedure '' @xcite on the individual attributes to define the macro level , we show how the nonlinearity features of dynamical process may naturally create `` something else '' at least in a stylized model .",
    "next , related to parson s phenomenon of internalization _ practical emergence",
    "_ stands for the possible discrepancy , `` if the macrostructural properties of a social system no longer correspond to the internalized rules and interactions of the individual actors '' , which leads to `` a practical problem for the individuals acting in this system '' . at the end of section [ subsection - delta2-transient ]",
    "we discuss a possible quantification , in a very rough sense , of this `` falling out '' ( @xcite , pag.339 ) of the micro and macro levels .",
    "finally , `` far more controversial '' ( @xcite , pag.339 ) _ explanatory emergence",
    "_ stands for a process leading to autonomous dynamics of structures ( @xcite , pags.280 - 303 )",
    ". we shall comment on this possibility in section [ section - generalizations ] , without really answering the question , but indicating how it could be taken into account in the framework of our models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section - microdynamics ] , starting from the idea introduced by izquierdo and co - workers @xcite we rigorously treat a class of abm as markov chains . our main idea is to give a solid basis to the link from a micro to a macro description in the abm context and fully explore the potential of this construction , a task to which sections [ section - projected ] and [ section - opinion - projected ] are devoted .",
    "generalizations concerning different opinion representations as well as opinion models with other interaction mechanisms are then discussed in section [ section - generalizations ] .",
    "we find that our method may be an attractive alternative to mean - field approaches and this approach can provide new perspectives on the modeling of opinion exchange dynamics , and more generally of other abm .",
    "we end up with some final remarks and a prospective for further work in section [ section - conclusion ] .",
    "[ section - microdynamics ]    here we consider the class of abm defined by a set n of agents , each one characterized by individual attributes that are taken in a finite list of possibilities .",
    "the meaning or the level of abstraction of the content of such attributes is not important as long as it can be codified in a finite , possibly very large , set of possibilities .",
    "the agents should also be able to regularly update their attributes according to the information conveyed from other agents as well as to their actual state .",
    "the collective updating process of the attributes of the agents at each time step consists of two parts .",
    "first a random choice of a subset of agents is made according to some probability distribution @xmath5 .",
    "the number of agents chosen at each time may also be random .",
    "then the attributes of the agents are changed ( updated ) according to some rule , called a dynamical rule , which depends on the the subset of agents selected at this time .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the individual state or attribute space and we call the configuration space @xmath7 the set of all possible combination of attributes of the agents , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "it is noteworthy pointing out the meaning of the distribution @xmath5 in cases where an abm is used to model human ( or animal , biological , etc . )",
    "it should be thought as the idealized footprint of a collective structure , in the sense of constraints upon agent agency as well as enablers .",
    "see , for example , ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a precise sense of structure as used in this context ) .",
    "notice that , at this level , the dynamics of the model is defined in the configuration space , which seeks to describe the dynamics of each agent in full detail .",
    "we shall refer to this as micro dynamics .",
    "let @xmath9 be a finite set ( ex . the configuration space of an abm ) and @xmath10 index a collection of maps @xmath11 and @xmath5 a probability distribution on @xmath10 . if @xmath12 is a sequence of independent random maps , each having distribution @xmath5 , and @xmath13 has distribution @xmath14 , then the sequence @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 is a markov chain on @xmath7 with transition matrix @xmath17 : @xmath18    conversely ( @xcite ) , any markov chain has a random map representation ( rmr ) .",
    "therefore ( [ rmr1 ] ) and ( [ rmr2 ] ) may be taken as an equivalent definition of a markov chain which is particularly useful in our case , because it shows that an abm that can be described as above is , from a mathematical point of view , a markov chain and can be treated following the approach developed in this work .",
    "this class includes the models described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to motivate and exemplify our point of view we introduce a model of opinion dynamics that is a particular case of the class of abm described above .",
    "we shall come back to this model during the paper to illustrate our results and to show how they lead up to final conclusions in this particular case .    to define the opinion model ,",
    "let us consider a population @xmath19 of @xmath20 agents and denote the opinion , which is the single attribute of agent @xmath21 at time @xmath22 as @xmath23 , where we assume that each agent can choose out of @xmath24 different alternative opinions so that the agent state space @xmath25 has @xmath24 states .",
    "let @xmath26 describe the opinions of all the agents at time @xmath22 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ opinion configuration _ or the _ opinion profile _ of the population",
    ". then the _ configuration space _ of the model is @xmath27 , the space of all possible configurations @xmath28 .    in this very simple opinion model the willingness of two agents ( @xmath29 ) to communicate depends on the similarity of their opinions",
    "this can be encoded in form of a confidence matrix @xmath30 such that @xmath31 if the opinions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are sympathetic @xmath34 if they are not .",
    "the confidence matrix came from the fact that we can define this matrix by means of a confidence threshold , usually defined by means of a threshold on a distance on the set @xmath6 of the possible opinions .",
    "the confidence matrix is defined , for any pair ( x , y ) of elements of @xmath35 by @xmath36 if the relative confidence @xmath37 is below threshold and @xmath38 if not .",
    "notice that a confidence matrix is a generalization of the notion of confidence threshold .",
    "] in the iteration process of this model , an agent pair @xmath39 is chosen at random `` to meet '' according to a probability distribution @xmath5 , ex .",
    "@xmath5 is the uniform distribution , @xmath40 , for all @xmath29 .",
    "if two agents @xmath41 meet and @xmath42 then agent @xmath21 imitates agent @xmath43 , that is @xmath44 , which brings us to define an updating function by @xmath45 .",
    "if , instead , @xmath46 the opinion configuration is not changed . because in this version of the model the first chosen agent always imitates the second , the model",
    "is sometimes called a directed opinion model .",
    "in fact we treat a more general class of abm with the following characteristics :    ( h1 ) there is a finite number @xmath20 of agents .",
    "the set of all agents is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "each agent is characterized by a single attribute which takes a value among @xmath47 possible alternatives .",
    "the set of @xmath47 elements of possible situations is denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "the configuration space is the set @xmath48 of all possible combinations of the situations for the @xmath20 agents .",
    "therefore , if @xmath49 we write @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "( h2 ) there is a @xmath52 matrix @xmath53 with entries @xmath54 or @xmath55 called the * confidence matrix * and an updating function denoted by @xmath56 that is a function from @xmath57 into @xmath57 .",
    "( h3 ) the abm is defined as a discrete time random walk in the configuration space @xmath58 .",
    "if the walker is in a configuration @xmath59 at time @xmath22 , it will jump to the configuration @xmath60 under the following prescription :    1 .",
    "two agents , it is easy to generalize what follows in this case by just defining @xmath5 , @xmath53 and @xmath56 accordingly . ] @xmath21 and @xmath43 are chosen according to a given probability distribution @xmath5 on @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   compute @xmath62 . if @xmath63 the walker does nt move . if @xmath64 then the walker moves to a configuration @xmath65 which defers from @xmath59 only eventually in the value of the attributes of the agents @xmath21 and @xmath43 .",
    "that is :    @xmath66    and @xmath67    [ no - alpha ]    the use of a confidence matrix @xmath53 is just a matter of convenience .",
    "it would be possible to absorb @xmath53 in @xmath56 by forcing @xmath68 .",
    "we use this double encoding of the updating rule to follow the tradition in the field , assigning the updating rule @xmath56 to `` the model '' and the confidence matrix @xmath53 to `` a parameter of the model '' .    as is clear from the previous discussion , under the hypotheses ( h1 ) , h(2 ) , ( h3 ) the abm is an homogeneous markov chain with state space @xmath58 being the configuration space and a transition probability @xmath69 as defined below .",
    "notice that , according to the transition rule described above , the possible jumps are constrained to a ball of `` hamming '' radius 2 around the actual configuration .",
    "we describe now the transition probability matrix of the markov chain according to eq .",
    "( [ rmr2 ] ) .",
    "let us say that a pair of configurations @xmath59 and @xmath60 are * adjacent * if all the agents have the same attribute values in x and in y except possibly the agents @xmath21 and @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath70 if @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these are denoted @xmath73 .",
    "then we define a transition probability matrix @xmath17 of a markov chain by    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    where @xmath77    notice that the summation in ( [ phat1 ] ) is needed because , in general , the updating function is not one to one in the configuration space so several links may join two given adjacent configurations .",
    "we shall see an example of such a situation in the opinion model .",
    "the transition probability matrix of a markov chain is of dimension @xmath78 and it describes the evolution of any initial distribution on the configuration ( state ) space . the comparison with a numerical simulation starting from some particular initial configuration may therefore be performed using the corresponding dirac distribution .",
    "but , even in this case , the markov analysis will spread this initial concentrated distribution in the course of the updating process .",
    "clearly it is possible to use other initial distributions for the markov chain , and each distribution will correspond to a set of numerical simulations with different initial configurations chosen according to the distribution .",
    "each row of the transition probability matrix has at most @xmath79 non  zero elements ( including a loop ) .",
    "this is due to the adjacency criteria , which encodes the fact that only a pair of agents may change their state from one step to the other .",
    "in fact , the non zero elements inside the row @xmath59 are determined by the possible choices of couples @xmath80 of components ( agents ) of @xmath59 .",
    "these non  zero elements will appear in the columns corresponding to the @xmath60 adjacent to @xmath59 for which @xmath64 .    despite the fact that all the information of the dynamics of the abm is encoded in such a markov chain , it is not always easy to learn directly from this fact , because of the over large dimension of the configuration space and its corresponding markov transition matrix .",
    "as an example of a question that may be answered at this level , we mention the characterization of absorbing configurations . these are the @xmath50 such that , for any @xmath81 , @xmath63 or @xmath82 and they are easy to identify even in the case of bounded confidence models .",
    "it is clear that the properties of the transient dynamics are most relevant for markov chains with absorbing configurations .",
    "the analytical study of these properties is based upon the corresponding fundamental matrix @xcite .",
    "but such computation needs to invert a matrix of order @xmath83 that can be performed only numerically .",
    "therefore another strategy is lacking to go further in this direction . in the next section",
    "we shall present one possibility to overcome this difficulty .",
    "as already noticed , the directed opinion model is a special case of such a formalism .",
    "there , only one coordinate of the configuration may change at each step .",
    "the transition probability matrix @xmath17 is obtained from ( [ phat1 ] ) , ( [ phat2 ] ) , ( [ phat3 ] ) and([kappa ] ) by restricting the corresponding sums to the first index @xmath21 only .",
    "one immediate consequence of the topology of this transition matrix is that in the opinion model the only absorbing configurations are complete consensus ( all the agents having the same opinion ) or mutually antagonistic ( agents having opinions @xmath84 and @xmath85 for which @xmath86 for all pairs @xmath87 ) .",
    "recall that , with probability one , the system falls in one of the absorbing states in finite ( although not uniform ) time .",
    "therefore we see how in this model the lack of confidence allows for new absorbing states , stabilizing non",
    " consensual opinion profiles .",
    "[ section - projected ]    a projection of a markov chain with state space @xmath58 is defined by a new state space @xmath88 and a ( projection ) map @xmath89 from @xmath58 to @xmath88 .",
    "the meaning of the projection @xmath89 is to lump sets of micro configurations in @xmath58 accordingly to some macro property in such a way that , for each @xmath90 , all the configurations of @xmath58 in @xmath91 share the same property .",
    "in fact such projections are important when catching the `` macroscopic '' properties of the corresponding abm because they are in complete correspondence with a classification based on an observable property of the system . to see how this correspondence works",
    "let us suppose that we are interested in some factual property of our agent based system .",
    "this means that we are able to assign to each configuration the specific value of its corresponding property .",
    "regardless of the kind of value used to specify the property(qualitative or quantitative ) , the set @xmath88 needed to describe the configurations with respect to the given property is a finite set , because the set of all configurations is also finite .",
    "let then @xmath92 be the function that assigns to any configuration @xmath93 the corresponding value of the considered property . it is natural to call such @xmath94 an observable of the system .",
    "now , any observable of the system naturally defines a projection @xmath89 by lumping the set of all the configurations with the same @xmath94 value .",
    "conversely any ( projection ) map @xmath89 from @xmath58 to @xmath88 defines an observable @xmath94 with values in the image set @xmath88 .",
    "therefore these two ways of describing the construction of a macrodynamics are equivalent and the choice of one or the other point of view is just a matter of taste .",
    "the price to pay in passing from the micro to the macrodynamics in this sense ( @xcite , @xcite ) is that the projected system is , in general , no longer a markov chain : long memory ( even infinite ) may appear in the projected system .",
    "given the transition probability and the initial distribution defining the first markov chain in @xmath58 , we are interested in the projected measure @xmath95 defined for all cylinders @xmath96 $ ] of @xmath88 by :    @xmath97 = \\hat\\mu \\pi^{-1 }   [ x_{(1)},x_{(2 ) } , \\dots , x_{(r)}]\\ ] ]    where @xmath98 denotes the corresponding probability for the initial markov chain .",
    "the conditions for a projection of a markov chain still to be a markov chain are known as lumpability ( or strong lumpability ) , and necessary and sufficient conditions for lumpability are known @xcite . in general it may happen that , for a given markov chain , some projections are markov and others not .",
    "therefore a judicious choice of the macro properties to be studied may help the analysis . in order to establish the lumpability in the cases of interest we shall use symmetries of the model . for further convenience",
    ", we state a result for which the proof is easily given thm .",
    "6.3.2 of @xcite :    [ proposition_lumpability ] let @xmath99 be a markov chain and @xmath100 a partition of @xmath58 .",
    "suppose that there exists a set @xmath101 of bijections of @xmath58 ( therefore a group of symmetries ) such that :    \\(1 ) @xmath101 preserves the partition : for any @xmath102 and any atom @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 .",

    "so lumpability of this partition leans on condition ( 3 ) of proposition([proposition_lumpability ] ) : the invariance of the markov transition matrix @xmath133 under the permutation group of agents .",
    "notice that no restriction on the confidence matrix is needed for it only depends on the opinions and not on the labeling of the agents .",
    "in fact , the probability distribution @xmath5 must be invariant under the permutation group @xmath132 and therefore uniform : @xmath40 , for all pair of agents ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing at this point that the uniform distribution , corresponding to the most unstructured dynamical rule , still entails emergent organized patterns in the system of opinions .",
    "because the set of opinions is dynamically organized , the homogeneity of the uniform distribution on the agent population has an implicit structure when viewed through the opinion content .",
    "moreover , for some other distributions @xmath5 , it may be possible to refine the partition so as to get lumpability .",
    "for instance , if the agents are divided in subsets in which @xmath5 is constant , then the partition defined by an equal number of opinions inside each subclass is lumpable . in this case",
    "@xmath53 will depend on the pair labeling of agents together with their respective opinions and not only on the latter .",

    "there is , however , an unexpected subtlety when we are interested in the macrodynamics of the agents ranked by only one of their attributes , for instance if the agents are separated in @xmath270 different groups according to the number of agents sharing their first attribute .",
    "then the partition is no longer lumpable , and therefore the evolution of the correspondent random variables ( for instance , the number of elements of each group ) is not a markov chain .",
    "again , in this case , new memory effects may appear from this choice of aggregation to build the macrodynamics .",
    "the proof can be done as in ( [ eq : f1t3.ya ] ) and ( [ eq : yanolumpprob ] ) .",
    "we shall finish this section by noticing a trick that makes it possible to extend the previous analysis to systems where the agents are defined on a lattice or , more generally , on a graph .",
    "they may coexist in some nodes of the graph or , sometimes they may even move on it . then , in some cases , it is possible to reduce the model to the framework of our work by defining the agents as the nodes in the graph and including the presence or lack of an actor in the prescription of the attributes defining the elements of @xmath35 as well as the topology of the graph accordingly in@xmath53 .",
    "[ section - conclusion ]    an important mark of abms is their ability to include arbitrary levels of heterogeneity and stochasticity ( or uncertainty ) into the description of a system of interacting agents .",
    "while computer simulations are often suited for making important dynamical trends of these models visible , a rigorous characterization of the different dynamical phases is difficult .    in this work",
    "we analyze the dynamics of an abm from a markovian perspective and derive explicit statements about the possibility of linking a microscopic agent model to the dynamical processes of macroscopic observables that are useful for a precise understanding of the model dynamics . in this way the dynamics of collective variables may be studied , and a description of macro dynamics as emergent properties of micro dynamics , in particularly during transient times , is possible . in our context , the random map representation ( rmr ) of a markov process helps to understand the role devoted to the collection of ( deterministic ) dynamical rules used in the model from one side and of the probability distribution @xmath5 governing the sequential choice of the dynamical rule used to update the system at each time step from the other side .",
    "the importance of this probability distribution , often neglected , is to encode the design of the social structure of the exchange actions at the time of the analysis . not only , then , are features of this probability distribution concerned with the social context the model aims to describe , but also they are crucial in predicting the properties of the macro  dynamics . if we decide to remain at a markovian level , then the partition , or equivalently the collective variables , to be used to build the model may be compatible with the symmetry of the probability distribution @xmath5 . in a sense",
    "the partition of the configuration space defining the macro  level of the description has to be refined in order to account for an increased level of heterogeneity or a falloff in the symmetry of the probability distribution .",
    "it is , however , clear that , in absence of any symmetry , there is no other choice for this partition than to stay at the micro  level and in this sense , no markovian description of a macro  level , is possible in this case .    at this point",
    "two possible approaches could be explored in the future : first to identify in specific models other natural symmetries inducing a markovian description of their macro counterpart and to study the evolution of the corresponding collective behavior ; and second , to tackle the problem of describing the dynamics of the macro variables in cases where they are not markovian .",
    "for this purpose the cases where @xmath5 is not homogeneous ( or symmetric ) but has special structural properties seem to be a crucial issue for further research .",
    "this point must have an important impact in the understanding of descriptive emergence since it is a ( the , in abm context ) source of long memory effects in the dynamics of the formation of collective social patterns .",
    "another important prospect concerns the measure of practical emergence or discrepancy , the gap between the macro - structural properties of a social system and internalized rules or intentions of the individual actors .",
    "the measure of this gap should lead to more elaborate gauges whose dynamics themselves call for new specific investigation .    as pointed out in section [ section - introduction ] , under certain circumstances the macro process may undergo dynamical changes in its own structural rules .",
    "this fact is referred to as explanatory emergence .",
    "it can be understood either as a consequence of some external ( to the model ) inputs or on the basis of deep accelerations of the micro dynamics that in turn bring about the processes of change at the macro level . in both cases",
    "this question opens up to new theoretical as well as very interesting practical developments .    in an abm",
    "as presented in section  [ section - microdynamics ] , the macro - structural patterns of social relations are encoded in the probability distribution @xmath5 , or its generalization when the model allows a simultaneous updating depending on more than two agents . therefore a dynamics of this structure may be incorporated in the model as a dynamics of the probability distribution , allowing it to be time dependent : @xmath275 .",
    "this can be done at different levels .",
    "the simplest one occurs when the structural dynamics is assumed to be autonomous , in the form of a master - slave system where the dynamics of the probability distribution is defined independently of the evolution of the process .",
    "it is natural to suppose that this dynamics is slow with respect to a fast dynamics of the agent changes .",
    "a more sophisticated modeling consists of coupling the individual agent dynamics with the dynamics of the distribution .",
    "this corresponds to assuming a feedback of the agent dynamics on the evolution of the structural rules fixing the macro dynamics . in both cases",
    "a rigorous treatment of the problem is sufficiently compelling to deserve further research .",
    "the formalization of the relations between the micro and the macro levels in the description of the dynamics of agent based models as well as their mathematical characterization is a step towards a mathematical theory of emergence in complex adaptive systems . in this work",
    "we showed how a markov chain approach , in particular the use of the notion of lumpability , provides useful instruments for the analysis of the link from a microscopic abm to macroscopic observables .",
    "further research is needed to deepen our understanding of this link in a more general setting .",
