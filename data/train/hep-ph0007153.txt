    "in order to understand the nature of the gottfried sum rule violation @xcite two different drell - yan experiments were performed @xcite .",
    "the integrated result for the asymmetry from a more complete fermilab experiment @xcite is @xmath4 \\ ; dx$ ] = 0.09 @xmath5 0.02 , to be compared with the nmc result : @xmath4 \\ ; dx$ ] = 0.148 @xmath5 0.039 .",
    "the nmc integral asymmetry apears slightly bigger .",
    "it was suggested recently @xcite that the difference can be partly due to large higher - twist effects for @xmath6 .",
    "recently the hermes collaboration @xcite used semi - inclusive unpolarized production of pions to extract the asymmetry .",
    "we discuss briefly a disturbing role of some nonpartonic processes which cloud the extraction of the asymmetry from semi - inclusive dis .",
    "in the quark - parton model ( see fig.1a ) the generalized semi - inclusive structure function can be written as @xmath7 where the sum runs over the quark / antiquark flavours @xmath8 , @xmath9 are quark distribution functions and @xmath10 are so - called fragmentation functions .",
    "the isospin and charge conjugation symmetries allow to reduce the number of fragmentation functions to two : favoured @xmath11 and unfavoured @xmath12 . for strange quarks does not enter the quantity analyzed here ( [ exp_extract ] ) . ]    in the qpm one can combine semi - inclusive cross sections for the production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 on proton and neutron targets to isolate a quantity sensitive to the flavour asymmetry @xcite @xmath15 - [ 1 + r(x , z ) ] }       { j(z ) [ 1 - r(x , z ) ] + [ 1 + r(x , z ) ] } \\ ; , \\label{exp_extract}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the absence of other mechanisms",
    "the equation can be used to extract the @xmath18-dependence of the difference @xmath2 .    in order to demonstrate the effect of nonpartonic components on the extraction of @xmath2 asymmetry we need to fix the effective fragmentation functions which the main partonic term will be calculated with .",
    "most of the model fragmentation functions were constructed in the context of @xmath19 pion production data , where amount of @xmath13 and @xmath14 produced is equal , and do not manage to describe separately multiplicity distributions of positive and negative pions in dis @xcite .",
    "besides separate yields of @xmath13 and @xmath14 the qpm formula ( [ exp_extract ] ) directly depends also on the ratio of unfavoured and favoured fragmentation functions .",
    "surprisingly only a rather old field - feynman parametrization @xcite provides a good representation of the available @xmath20 pion production data in the hermes kinematical region @xcite .",
    "this parametrization will be used in the following analysis .",
    "for small @xmath21 , as in the case of the hermes experiment , some mechanisms of nonpartonic origin may become important too .",
    "for instance the virtual photon can interact with the nucleon via its intermediate hadronic state .",
    "such a mechanism can be described within the vector dominance model ( vdm ) .",
    "the photon could also fluctuate into a pair of pions , where both or one of them interact with the nucleon .",
    "some exclusive processes can produce pions directly or as decay products of heavier mesons .    to our best knowledge none of such processes",
    "has been investigated in the literature .",
    "their influence on the extracted @xmath2 asymmetry also remains unknown . here for illustration we discuss only two of them .",
    "let us start from the vdm component ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "it was shown recently that the inclusion of the vdm contribution and a related modification of the partonic component help to understand the behaviour of structure functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 at small @xmath21 and broad range of bjorken-@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this model was confirmed by a recent analysis of the @xmath21-dependence of the world data for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the model for inclusive structure functions @xcite can be generalized to semi - inclusive production of pions : @xmath24 the second sum above runs over vector mesons @xmath25 and @xmath26 decribes a correction factor due to finite fluctuation time of virtual photon into vector mesons for large @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the inclusive cross section for pion production in vector meson ( @xmath27 ) scattering off proton and neutron is not known experimentally . in analogy to the total cross section the pion production inclusive cross section @xmath28 can be estimated as : @xmath29 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma(\\rho^0",
    "n \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\pm } x ) & \\approx &    1/2 \\ ; [ \\sigma(\\pi^+ n \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\pm } x )           + \\sigma(\\pi^- n \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\pm } x ) ] \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] experimental data from the abbcchw collaboration @xcite at @xmath30 = 8 , 16 gev correspond approximately to the range of the hermes experiment @xcite .    however , the experimental spectra for @xmath31 contain components due to peripheral processes , which are specific , different for different beams .",
    "we wish to note that peripheral processes in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 reactions do not contribute to the @xmath34 reaction and should be eliminated ; only nondiffractive components for @xmath35 reactions should be taken into account .",
    "this requires a physically motivated parametrization of the @xmath36 data .",
    "therefore we have parametrized the experimental differential cross sections for four different reactions @xmath31 from @xcite as a sum of central and peripheral components @xmath37 the details of the analysis will be given elsewhere @xcite . because the cm - energy of the abbcchw collaboration is very similar to that of the hermes experiment , we believe that the parametrization is suitable in the limiting range of energy relevant for the hermes experiment @xcite .",
    "the cross sections on the neutron can be obtained from those on the proton by assuming isospin symmetry for the hadronic reactions .",
    "the analysis of experimental data @xcite combined with the assumption of isospin symmetry strongly indicate that for the _ nondiffractive _ components @xcite @xmath38 this automatically means that the vdm contribution modifies the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([exp_extract ] ) .    in fig.2",
    "we show a modification of the measured hermes quantity @xmath39 due to the vdm component . in the present calculation",
    "the photon - proton cm energy was fixed at the average hermes value @xmath40 = 5.0 gev@xmath41 and the quark fragmentation component was rescalled by a factor @xmath42 ( see eq.([su_semi ] ) ) .",
    "the solid line represents @xmath39 obtained directly from the parton distributions @xcite . as can be seen from the figure the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([exp_extract ] ) clearly deviates from the partonic result .",
    "thus , if not canceled by other effects , the quark flavour asymmetry extracted from semi - inclusive experiments in the simple qpm approach seems to be highly overestimated .      the exclusive meson production @xmath44 is not included in the fragmentation formalism and may also modify the extraction of @xmath2 asymmetry .",
    "the pion exclusive channels ( @xmath45 ) contribute at @xmath46 1 , i.e. outside of the range of the hermes kinematics and will be ignored here .",
    "the pions from decays of light vector mesons can be important in the context of the @xmath2 asymmetry .",
    "the production of @xmath43 mesons ( @xmath47 ) seems to be of particular importance .",
    "first of all the @xmath48 channel is know to be the dominant exclusive channel in the @xmath49 scattering . secondly , because @xmath3 decays predominantly into two pions it will produce pions with @xmath50 .",
    "a detailed calculation @xcite shows that the dispersion of the decay - pion @xmath51-distribution is large and therefore this effect could be observed at large @xmath51 where hadronization rate is rather small . below as an example we shall consider the @xmath3 elastic production only .    the elastic @xmath3-production contribution ( diagram ( c ) in fig.1 ) to semi - inclusive structure function can be written formally as @xmath52 the cross section for proton and neutron target and their difference can be estimated within the regge approach as well as in a qcd inspired quark - exchange model .",
    "it is not clear a priori what is the applicability range of these models . in this short note",
    "we shall try to understand the elastic @xmath3 meson production only within the regge phenomenology .",
    "this requires an analysis of relevant experimental data for the proton and deuteron targets simultaneously .",
    "while for the proton target there are data in quite a broad kinematical range of @xmath18 and @xmath21 @xcite ( although slightly different from the hermes kinematics ) , there is almost no data for the deuteron target .",
    "we have parametrized the existing experimental data for exclusive @xmath3 production by means of the following simple regge - inspired reaction amplitude @xmath53 \\cdot c_{is}(t ) \\left ( \\frac{s}{s_0 } \\right)^{-1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\pm & \\left [ \\frac{-1+i}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\right ] \\cdot c_{iv}(t ) \\left ( \\frac{s}{s_0 } \\right)^{-1/2 } % \\right ] ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\cdot \\left [ \\frac{m_{\\rho}^2}{m_{\\rho}^2+q^2 } \\right ] \\delta_{\\lambda_{n ' } \\lambda_{n } } \\delta_{\\lambda_{v } \\lambda_{\\gamma } } \\label{regge_amplitude}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with `` @xmath54 '' for proton and `` @xmath55 '' for neutron , respectively . in practical application",
    "we shall assume the same t - dependence of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and take @xmath59 .",
    "the free parameters in eq.([regge_amplitude ] ) i.e. @xmath60 , @xmath56 and @xmath61 have been fitted to the existing experimental data for @xmath62-integrated differential cross section for @xmath3 production on hydrogen @xcite . in this fit",
    "we have limited to the experimental data with @xmath63 3 gev ( to avoid resonances ) and @xmath64 10 gev@xmath41 ( above genuine hard qcd processes should reveal ) and fixed the slope parameter @xmath65 = 6 gev@xmath66 in exponential @xmath62-distribution which is known experimentally .",
    "all other details of the analysis will be discussed in @xcite .    from the fit to the proton data we have obtained only a sum of the coefficients @xmath61 .",
    "the separation into the isoscalar and isovector contributions can not be done in a model independent way .",
    "the size of the isovector @xmath67-exchange contribution was estimated long ago for total photoproduction cross section ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "our regge model can be applied to both real and virtual photoproduction and exclusive as well as inclusive case @xcite .",
    "we have used the data for real photoproduction total cross section and the data for exclusive @xmath68 photoproduction to estimate the size of the isovector amplitude @xcite i.e. the strength of @xmath67-reggeon exchange .",
    "although the difference of the cross sections for exclusive @xmath3 photoproduction on the neutron / proton targets calculated with resulting amplitudes is small , its effect on the @xmath69 ratio extracted by the hermes collaboration , shown in fig.3 , is not negligible at all .",
    "we show in the figure the `` measured '' hermes quantity as a function of bjorken-@xmath18 for a few values of @xmath51 for a fixed @xmath40 = 5 gev . as in the case of the vdm contribution",
    "the qpm term was modified by the factor @xmath42 according to our prescription for inclusive structure functions @xcite .",
    "the semi - inclusive production of pions was recently used to determine the @xmath70 asymmetry in the nucleon sea . in the present analysis",
    "we have investigated a few effects beyond the quark - parton model which may influence the so - extracted asymmetry .    according to our estimation the interaction of the resolved hadron - like component of the photon with the nucleon leads to an artificial enhancement of the measured @xmath2 asymmetry in the region of small @xmath18 .",
    "this enhancement depends on @xmath51 very weakly .",
    "the elastic production of @xmath3 meson is equally important .",
    "this effect , however , modifies the measured @xmath2 asymmetry in the opposite direction from the resolved photon component , but the two effects cancel only within a narrow interval of @xmath51 .",
    "the elastic @xmath3 production makes the r.h.s . of eq.([exp_extract ] ) @xmath51-dependent invalidating somewhat averaging done in @xcite .",
    "here we have only shortly discussed two effects .",
    "a more detailed analysis of these two and other effects will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally we wish to conclude that nonperturbative effects beyond qpm may substantially disturb the extraction of the @xmath2 asymmetry from semi - inclusive production of pions in dis .",
    "such an extraction requires a carefull combined analysis including many nonpartonic effects together with main partonic term .",
    "in addition we would like to point out that some of the effects discussed in the present paper may also influence the extraction of the polarized quark distributions from semi - inclusive production of pions in dis .",
