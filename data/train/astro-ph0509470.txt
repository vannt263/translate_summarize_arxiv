    "this is the first time such a large and homogeneous analysis of the orbital anisotropy can be performed using integral - field stellar kinematics and relatively general models .",

    "the slow - rotators are more common among the brightest systems , they are generally classified as e from photometry alone , they can display misalignement between the photometric and kinematical axes , indicating they can not all be axisymmetric , they tend to appear nearly round and to have an almost isotropic velocity dispersion tensor .",

    "while the fast - rotators can be described as a family of oblate anisotropic galaxies , seen at different inclinations , the slow - rotators are inconsistent with this distribution .",
    "the presence of kinematical misalignments indicates that the slow - rotators are ( weakly ) triaxial systems .",

    "the diagram appears to be populated by the two groups of ( i ) weakly triaxial and nearly isotropic slow - rotators ( ii ) nearly oblate and anisotropic fast - rotators .",
    "the significant anisotropy of the fast - rotators agrees with the recent results of numerical simulations ( burkert & naab 2005 ) suggesting a formation process from gas rich disk galaxies , followed by disk heating due to minor mergers or secular evolution .",
    "the slow - rotators have long been considered the result of equal mass collisionless mergers ( barnes 1988 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) but from our new data they appear significantly rounder and closer to isotropic than current numerical simulations predict .",
    "we are currently investigating the reasons of the differences between our new @xmath0 and the ones previously derived from long - slit spectroscopy , including selection effects .",
    "we speculate that the two classes of fast and slow - rotating galaxies may be the relics of the different formation paths followed by early - type galaxies when loosing their gas content and moving from the `` blue cloud '' to the `` red sequence '' , in the `` quenching '' scenario of faber et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in that picture",
    "the fast - rotators are naturally associated to the spiral galaxies whose disks were quenched by ram - pressure stripping or other processes not involving significant mergers .",
    "subsequent disk heating associated to minor mergers or secular evolution can explain the correlation between the thickening of the disk and the vertical velocity dispersion ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the slow - rotators can be generated by a sequence of ` dry ' mergers ( i.  e.  involving little amount of gas ) along the red sequence , or due to major violent gas rich mergers in which the gas component was rapidly expelled by a starburst or a central agn ."
