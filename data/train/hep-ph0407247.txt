    "these are theoretical _ predictions _ , as the sather and rodionov papers were published in 1992 and 1994 , respectively , well before the analysis of the nutev data . like the isoscalar corrections to the pw ratio ,",
    "the csv corrections involve the ratio of identical moments of parton distributions , and are thus independent of @xmath23 ; consequently they do not depend on any details of qcd evolution .",
    "the negative sign of the result means that csv corrections will decrease the discrepancy between the nutev result for the weinberg angle , and the weinberg angle extracted from the extremely precise data obtained from electron - positron colliders near the @xmath92 mass .",
    "indeed , the predicted csv corrections to the pw ratio remove roughly 40% of the magnitude of the nutev anomaly . as discussed in the preceding section , less than 1% of the valence quark momentum",
    "is carried by the relevant csv combination , so this is well within the experimental limits on quark momentum .",
    "londergan and thomas @xcite showed that sather s formula of eq .",
    "[ eq : satanl ] provided an analytic estimate of csv corrections to the pw ratio ; taking the second moment of sather s equations gives d _ = d _ + ; u _",
    "= ( u _ - 2 )",
    "[ eq : intuv ] sather s approximation predicts that the csv correction to the pw ratio depends only on the fraction of nucleon momentum carried by up and down valence quarks .",
    "[ eq : intuv ] predicts that @xmath93 will be positive and @xmath94 negative , in agreement with the theoretical model results .",
    "it is especially interesting that sather s analytic approximation allows one to calculate the csv correction to the pw ratio directly from valence quark pdfs , without ever having to calculate specific csv distributions .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ eq : intuv ] , we also calculated the csv correction to the pw ratio using the cteq4lq phenomenological parton distribution @xcite at @xmath95 gev@xmath57 , obtaining @xmath90  again in agreement with the results obtained from the two quark model calculations .",
    "[ eq : intuv ] shows why the csv corrections are so similar in various models ; the correction depends only on the momentum carried by up and down valence quarks , a quantity well determined in pdfs .    since the nutev group @xcite did not directly measure the pw ratio",
    ", one must multiply the csv pdfs with the relevant functional in eq .",
    "[ eq : func ] @xcite .",
    "this requires evolving the csv parton distribution functions from the quark - model scale to @xmath96 gev@xmath57 , the average momentum transfer for the nutev experiment .",
    "after qcd evolution and folding with the nutev functionals , the resulting csv corrections to the nutev result are @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the rodionov , sather and cteq4lq pdfs , respectively .",
    "the csv corrections decrease the nutev discrepancy in the weinberg angle by about 30% , or one standard deviation .",
    "while some groups have obtained substantially smaller estimates for the charge symmetry violating contribution to the nutev anomaly @xcite , in the first case the constraint on baryon number was not respected while the second paper assumed a completely different mechanism for parton csv . on the other hand , as we discuss next , the phenomenological values for csv allow considerably larger isospin violation than any of the theoretical estimates .",
    "valence quark csv makes a substantially larger contribution than sea quark csv to the extraction of the weinberg angle from neutrino dis .",
    "using the sea - quark csv and the best - fit value for valence quark csv obtained by the mrst group , would remove roughly @xmath99 of the nutev anomaly .",
    "the value @xmath100 , within the 90% confidence limit found by mrst , would completely remove the nutev anomaly , while the value @xmath101 would double the discrepancy .",
    "the mrst results show that isospin violating pdfs are able to completely remove the nutev anomaly in the weinberg angle , or to make it twice as large , without serious disagreement with any of the data used to extract quark and gluon pdfs .",
    "there are other possible corrections to the weinberg angle extracted by the nutev experiment , but for the most part the corrections are small and/or well understood .",
    "the correction for the neutron excess in iron is large , but apparently well known @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections are also large , but also believed to be under control @xcite , although the radiative corrections are being re - analyzed @xcite .",
    "the situation with strange quarks is not certain .",
    "spontaneously broken chiral su(3 ) @xmath102 su(3 ) symmetry implies an asymmetry between @xmath103 and @xmath104  @xcite . as a direct consequence of such an asymmetry",
    "there is a correction to the extraction of the weinberg angle that depends on the momentum asymmetry s _ = _ 0 ^ 1 xdx .",
    "[ eq : sasym ] a positive ( negative ) value for @xmath105 , meaning that strange quarks carry more ( less ) net momentum than strange antiquarks , would decrease ( increase ) the size of the weinberg anomaly . the strange quark and antiquark distributions can be extracted from the cross sections for opposite sign dimuons in reactions induced by neutrinos or antineutrinos ; such reactions have been measured by the ccfr @xcite and nutev @xcite collaborations .",
    "the nutev group has extracted strange and antistrange pdfs from the dimuon production reactions ; they obtain values for @xmath105 that are consistent with zero , or perhaps small and negative @xcite .",
    "the cteq group on the other hand @xcite , has included the dimuon data in a global fit of pdfs ; they obtain positive values for @xmath105 that could account for roughly one - third of the weinberg angle anomaly . in both nutev and cteq analyses",
    "the strange quark distributions are determined from the same ccfr / nutev dimuon data , but at present the two analyses obtain qualitatively different results for the strange quark momentum asymmetry .    in conclusion",
    ", it seems that the magnitude of csv effects allowed by the mrst fit makes charge symmetry violation one of the only viable explanations for the anomalous value of the weinberg angle obtained in the nutev neutrino experiment .",
    "if csv effects are sufficiently large to remove the weinberg angle anomaly , such effects should be visible in various other experiments .",
    "we had previously suggested several experiments that could potentially reveal the presence of parton csv @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of those effects were based on theoretical calculations that predicted substantially smaller csv effects than are allowed by mrst .",
    "it is clearly of great interest now to investigate this issue experimentally .",
