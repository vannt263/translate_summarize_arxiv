    "o - type stars are most commonly found within young open clusters and ob associations in the spiral arms of the galaxy @xcite , and the binary frequency among these cluster and association members is significantly higher ( between @xmath1 ) than among field o stars ( @xmath2 ) and runaways ( about @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "multiple o star systems in clusters are particularly influential in the dynamics of the cluster because stars will be ejected both through supernova explosions in close binaries and through close gravitational encounters of stars with binaries .",
    "triple o star systems containing a close pair and a more widely separated component are particularly important sites of gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "hd  16429  a ( hip  12495 , v482  cas , sao  12383 , bd+@xmath4 ) is an o9.5 ii ( ( n ) ) star @xcite and a member of the cas ob6 association @xcite .",
    "it has two optical companions , component b at a separation of 6.66 arcsec , and c at a separation of 53.2 arcsec @xcite .",
    "hd  16429  b is an f4 v star @xcite , which indicates that it is not physically associated with a. component c is more likely associated based upon its magnitude and color ( see  4 ) .",
    "the a component was itself found to be a speckle binary with a separation of 0.30 arcsec @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that one component of a may also be a spectroscopic binary , making it a triple system , but they were unable to identify the period of this close pair .",
    "all of the components of the heirarchical hd  16429 system are shown in figure 1 .",
    "other observations have shown hd  16429  a to be a radio emitter @xcite as well as a weak x - ray source @xcite .",
    "the radio and x - ray emission probably originates in the stellar winds @xcite .",
    "here i present evidence to confirm that hd  16429  a is a triple star system with a spectroscopic binary component ( hd  16429  ab1 ) and a radial velocity stationary companion ( hd  16429  aa ) .",
    "the aa and ab1 components were isolated using a doppler tomography algorithm , but the ab2 component remains hidden .",
    "approximate spectral types and relative flux contributions are presented for the two visible components .",
    "finally , i discuss the stars in the immediate vicinity of hd  16429  a and their relationship to the cas  ob6 association .",
    "thirty - five optical spectra of hd  16429  a were obtained with the kitt peak national observatory 0.9-m coud feed telescope during runs in 2000 october and 2000 december .",
    "the spectra have a resolving power @xmath5 using the long collimator , grating b ( in second order with order sorting filter og550 ) , camera 5 , and the f3 kb ccd , a ford aerospace @xmath6 device .",
    "these arrangements produced a spectral coverage of @xmath7  .",
    "usually two exposures of 15 minutes duration were taken each night , separated by @xmath8 hours .",
    "the spectrum of the rapidly rotating a - type star , @xmath9  aql , was observed each night for removal of atmospheric water vapor and o@xmath10 bands .",
    "also , the o - type stars hd  34078 and hd  47839 were observed as spectral comparisons .",
    "each set of observations was accompanied by numerous bias , flat field , and th  ar comparison lamp calibration frames .",
    "the dates of observation are given in table  1 .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines in iraf .",
    "all the spectra were rectified to a unit continuum by fitting line - free regions .",
    "the removal of atmospheric lines was done by creating a library of @xmath9  aql spectra from each run , removing the broad stellar features from these , and then dividing each target spectrum by the modified atmospheric spectrum that most closely matched the target spectrum in a selected region dominated by atmospheric absorptions .",
    "some glitches appeared as artifacts of the removal of the atmospheric telluric lines , and these were excised by linear interpolation .",
    "the spectra from each run were then transformed to a common heliocentric wavelength grid .",
    "radial velocities were measured by fitting a parabola to the line cores of h@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , but several factors made it difficult to obtain consistent measurements .",
    "the h@xmath11 line shows variable p cygni emission that pushes the line s center blueward . due to this certain contamination",
    ", radial velocities from the h@xmath11 line were not used .",
    "in addition , measurements of the @xmath14 line have a slightly lower mean radial velocity than the mean for the @xmath12 line .",
    "this could be due to different relative line strengths of the lines in the blended stars , contamination from @xmath15 absorption in one component , or a radial velocity gradient due to outflowing winds ( see  4 ) .",
    "however , the difference in their mean velocities is small and only corresponds to a difference of 1.4 pixels on the chip , so the mean velocity of the two lines was used in this analysis .    to account for small deviations in radial velocity due to the wavelength calibration ,",
    "the interstellar lines present in the spectra were inspected .",
    "a large number of interstellar features were identified from the lists of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and especially @xcite .",
    "an interstellar spectrum was created by extracting these lines from the mean hd  16429 spectrum , and then it was cross correlated with each individual spectrum to measure any systematic radial velocity shift ( generally @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 ) .",
    "the velocity shift was subtracted from the measured radial velocities , and the resulting velocities are shown in the third column of table 1 . in the next section , i will show that these radial velocities actually represent the results of line blending between a single - lined spectroscopic binary and a stationary component .",
    "visual inspection of the spectra revealed radial velocity variations indicative of an orbital period of about 3 days , but a more precise period search was done using a version of the discrete fourier transform and clean deconvolution algorithm of @xcite ( written in idl by a.  w.  fullerton ) .",
    "the most significant signal found in the cleaned power spectrum occurs at the period @xmath18  d. relics of this signal also occur at integer multiples of this frequency , but the true period can not be shorter because there are no significant changes in radial velocity over the @xmath8 hour intervals between the observations from a given night .",
    "this period was used with the non - linear , least - squares fitting program of @xcite to solve for the orbital elements .",
    "the best fit was obtained by allowing the period to vary slightly , to an improved value of @xmath19  d , and assigning only half weight to one point with very large scatter near 0.95 phase .",
    "the resulting preliminary orbital elements are listed in the second column of table  2 , and the radial velocity curve is illustrated in figure  2 with the dotted line .",
    "note that this curve has been shifted in phase so that the epoch , @xmath20 , corresponds to the final time of periastron , discussed below .",
    "the observed minus calculated velocity errors ( @xmath21 ) based on this preliminary solution are given in table  1 , column  4 .",
    "the root - mean - square of the velocity residuals is comparable to the scatter in the best measured lines .",
    "there are a number of other radial velocity measurements for hd  16429  a in the literature ( 10 by @xcite , 15 by @xcite , and 1 by @xcite ) , so these measurements were combined with those in table  1 to refine the orbital period .",
    "since each investigation used different spectral lines and wavelength regions to measure velocities , the results may have systematic differences .",
    "however , the agreement between data sets was reasonable , and including the additional measurements significantly improved the orbital period ,",
    "@xmath22  d.    the speckle results @xcite indicate that at least two bright components were recorded in these spectra , so i created grayscale images of the spectral lines as a function of orbital phase to search for evidence of multiple components .",
    "figure  3 shows the plot of the @xmath12 line .",
    "it clearly reveals signs of a single - lined spectroscopic binary , ab1 , superimposed upon a stationary component , aa , with similar systemic velocity , consistent with expectations from the speckle observations . because the stationary component s lines are blended with the moving component , the preliminary radial velocity semiamplitude of the moving component is probably greatly underestimated , and perhaps the preliminary eccentricity and longitude of periastron are misrepresented as well .    to determine the true orbital elements of the ab1 component ,",
    "the aa component was isolated using a two - component tomographic separation and then subtracted from the observations .",
    "tomographic separation relies upon the radial velocity estimates of the stars and their flux ratio to recreate the spectra of the individual stars @xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses the observed composite spectra , approximate flux ratios of the stars , the center of mass velocity , @xmath23 , and the velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath24 , of component ab1 to calculate the solution using an iterative least squares technique . for the aa component ,",
    "the velocity amplitude was set to 0 .",
    "a three - component separation was not attempted because of the extreme faintness of the ab2 spectroscopic component .",
    "even the two - component separation was difficult because the true velocity amplitude , @xmath24 , of ab1 is unknown , and visual inspection of figure 2 reveals that it could be as high as 200  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the tomographic separation is not very sensitive to the choice of the relative flux contribution of the components .",
    "initially , an equal flux contribution was assumed , and the value was later refined according to the methods discussed in the following section .",
    "i computed tomographic separations for a grid of assumed semi - amplitudes for @xmath25  km  s@xmath17 . in order to identify the best fit value of @xmath24 , i used the separated components to recreate a set of synthetic spectra for each observation which",
    "was then compared to the original spectra .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath14 line regions were used separately to compute the @xmath26 error between the observed and recreated spectra .",
    "the errors associated with the @xmath14 line were slightly larger because that line is located in a region with many atmospheric telluric lines , so it was correspondingly noisier after the telluric removal process .",
    "the values of @xmath24 corresponding to the minimum error for each line were then averaged to obtain the optimal value of @xmath27  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "once the aa component was isolated , i subtracted its profile from the observed spectra to attain profiles of the ab1 component alone , and then i measured the radial velocities of ab1 in the same way as before .",
    "these unblended radial velocities are listed in column 5 of table  1 .",
    "the new orbital elements of the spectroscopic binary were calculated using the same technique discussed above and are included in the last column of table  2 .",
    "table 1 , column 2 lists the orbital phase from periastron based on this final solution . although the optimal @xmath24 is @xmath28  km  s@xmath17 , the orbital fitting program found a slightly higher value of @xmath29  km  s@xmath17 , but these estimates are consistent within errors .",
    "figure  2 includes the final radial velocities for the moving component as the solid points and the theoretical radial velocity curve as the solid line , and the new grayscale plot of the isolated moving component is shown in figure  4 . the signal to noise ratio is too low to positively identify the anti - phase motion of the spectroscopic companion ab2 in this plot .",
    "the flux ratio of the two visible components of hd  16429  a was determined using their observed speckle magnitudes , @xmath30 ( mason & hartkopf 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "the stationary star contributes a stronger signal in the spectra , and it is also the brighter component with 61  @xmath31 of the overall luminosity .",
    "this star is hd  16429  aa described by @xcite , whereas the visible moving component is hd  16429  ab1 .",
    "the flux ratio can also be estimated using the equivalent width of each component s @xmath12 line .",
    "@xcite found that in late o stars of all luminosity classes , the equivalent width of this line is roughly constant ( but with a large scatter ) , and i adopted the method of @xcite to determine the flux ratio of the stars from their observed equivalent widths . assuming an intensity ratio @xmath32 for the tomographic reconstruction , the resulting equivalent widths of the reconstructed moving and stationary component spectra are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the relative continuum intensities are then @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , and the absolute line strengths are @xmath37 and @xmath38 . because the true strengths of the lines are the same in each star , the true intensity ratio is @xmath39 . by integrating over the @xmath12 line in each component and comparing their equivalent widths ,",
    "the contribution of the stationary component was found to be about @xmath40 of the system s total luminosity .",
    "this value agrees reasonably well with that obtained from speckle observations , but is less accurate because of the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath12 widths , so i adopted the flux ratio from the speckle observations .",
    "figure  5 presents a plot of the reconstructed spectra , using the final @xmath41  km  s@xmath17 and normalized for their flux contribution .",
    "the figure also shows the aa and ab1 components compared to two stars of similar spectral type , hd 34078 and hd 47839 .",
    "the comparison spectra have been smoothed using a gaussian profile so that their fwhm and line depths more closely match those of the separated components .",
    "this smoothing does not significantly affect the equivalent widths of the lines .",
    "the spectra of the aa and ab1 components have also been smoothed slightly to reduce noise .",
    "the tomographic separation of the spectra revealed that both visible components of hd  16429  a have strong h@xmath11 and lines .",
    "the smoothed spectra of hd  34078 and hd  47839 have lines of similar strength , although stronger h@xmath11 profiles . h@xmath11 emission is common in luminous o stars ( luminosity classes i , ii , and iii ) , so the difference in line strengths is likely due to emission in hd  16429  a. ( hd  34078 and hd  47839 are both main sequence o stars with no emission . )",
    "the emission may not have been distributed properly between the two component stars during the tomographic separation because it varies on a non - orbital timescale .",
    "the original blended spectra showed striking p  cygni emission in the h@xmath11 line , which is associated almost entirely with the aa component in the reconstructions .",
    "this widely - separated member of the triple system is probably the more evolved of the group since it has such strong emission from stellar winds .",
    "since it is the more luminous , the stationary component corresponds to the o9.5 ii type that was assigned to the system by @xcite .",
    "the ( ( n ) ) suffix used by walborn to indicate slightly broadened lines probably reflects the line blending with the ab1 component .",
    "the line strengths are similar to those in hd 34078 , an o9.5 v star .",
    "the absence of significant provides further confirmation of the spectral type .",
    "the separation also revealed weak @xmath42 , 6683 , and 6891 absorption in the ab1 component .",
    "lines only appear in o spectra , disappearing entirely in the earliest b spectra .",
    "their presence indicates that this star is hotter than the brighter aa star . comparing the strengths of these lines with those in hd 47839",
    "reveals that the moving component is a slightly later , o8 spectral type , although the luminosity class can not be specified by the comparison .",
    "however , the difference in speckle magnitudes is consistent with an o8  iii - v classification for hd  16429  ab1 @xcite .",
    "the second spectroscopic companion , ab2 , remains hidden even after the tomographic separation ( fig .",
    "4 ) , but the statistical method of @xcite suggests that it is a massive , early b - type star . for single - lined spectroscopic binaries consisting of a primary of mass @xmath43 and a secondary of mass @xmath44 , with a mass ratio @xmath45 , the mass function is given by @xmath46  sin  @xmath47  @xmath48 .",
    "it can not be solved uniquely for both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but mazeh & goldberg recommend an iterative solution based on a random distribution of both parameters . given the known mass function and the primary mass , the mass ratio can be calculated for each possible inclination and then averaged over the range of inclinations . using a mass of @xmath51 for the o8  iii - v primary @xcite and @xmath52 from the final orbital solution ,",
    "the probable mass ratio is 0.6 .",
    "this is inconsistent with a low mass compact companion , but suggests instead a @xmath53 early b - type star @xcite . the ab2 component remains hidden because its flux is overwhelmed by the two brighter o stars . if these masses are adopted , then the orbital inclination is approximately @xmath54 , and no eclipses are expected ( or observed by hipparcos ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are several stars in the vicinity of hd  16429  a , including the be x - ray binary ls  i  + @xmath0 , that have similar radial velocities , proper motions , apparent @xmath55 magnitudes , and @xmath56 colors ( summarized in table  3 ) .",
    "parabolic fits of the @xmath12 and @xmath14 lines in the tomographically isolated spectrum of the aa component provided its average radial velocity of @xmath57  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "this is somewhat different than the systemic velocity of the spectroscopic pair , @xmath58  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "however , the observed difference in @xmath59 in hd  16429  aa and ab1 is probably due to differing wind velocities of the two stars .",
    "radial velocities of photospheric lines are known to reflect the outward acceleration of the line formation region @xcite .",
    "ls  i  + @xmath0 has a systemic velocity @xmath60  km  s@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "no radial velocities are available for hd  16429  c or als  7378 .",
    "the proper motion of each star is from the simbad database . for hd  16429  aa and ab1 , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "were found using the values from @xcite and the flux ratio determined above . for ls",
    "i  + @xmath0 , those values were found by averaging those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ls  i  + @xmath0 has a somewhat redder @xmath56 than the other stars , but it has previously been identified with the cas ob6 association by @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 for the remaining stars are from the simbad database . based on these similarities , hd  16429  a and its neighbors probably make up a small sub - cluster within the cas ob6 association .",
    "the stars in this sub - cluster were probably born in the same generation of star formation and therefore have approximately the same age and distance .",
    "@xcite used main sequence fitting to determine a distance of @xmath61  kpc to the cas ob6 association .",
    "however , @xcite used a kinematical model of the galaxy to determine the distance to ls  i  + @xmath0 based on the velocities of absorption lines in its spectrum , and they placed that system at a closer distance of @xmath62  kpc ( confirmed by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore i adopted a distance of 2.0  kpc for the group .",
    "placing the stars on evolutionary tracks in a color - magnitude diagram is difficult since the reddening is variable across the association @xcite . for hd  16429",
    "a , the spectral type of each component was used to obtain its intrinsic @xmath56 @xcite , which was then combined with the observed @xmath56 for the system @xcite to determine its reddening , @xmath63 , and absolute magnitude , @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite provides @xmath65 for ls  i  + @xmath0 .",
    "the reddening of hd  16429  c and als  7378 was estimated assuming that each is a b0 v star ( based on their @xmath66 and @xmath55 magnitudes relative to hd  16429  a ) and following the same procedure used for hd  16429  a. table 3 also lists the @xmath63 and @xmath64 for each star in the sub - cluster .",
    "@xcite provides temperatures of massive stars based on their spectral types , and i used her calibration to find their temperatures and bolometric corrections @xcite .",
    "their luminosities were found using the expression log  @xmath67 .",
    "the evolutionary tracks for non - rotating stars of @xcite , based on log @xmath20 and log @xmath68 , provide estimates of the current and initial stellar masses as well as stellar ages , and these are also included in table 3 . it is interesting to note that the initial mass of hd  16429  aa places a lower limit on the initial mass of the neutron star progenitor in ls  i  + @xmath0 . it must have originated in a star with more than 39 @xmath69 when the group formed @xmath70 myr ago to have evolved more quickly than hd  16429  aa .",

    "i also thank david wingert and wenjin huang for taking many of the observations , and the kpno staff for their assistance and travel support .",
