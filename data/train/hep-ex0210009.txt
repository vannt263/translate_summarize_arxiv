    "within the context of 3-flavor neutrino flavor mixing @xcite , the atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite have observed @xmath1 oscillations with @xmath2  ev@xmath3 and @xmath4 , while solar neutrino experiments@xcite indicate @xmath5  ev@xmath3 and @xmath6 . unlike the quark mixing matrix , neutrino mixing appears near - maximal .",
    "only upper bounds @xcite exist on the process @xmath7 at the atmospheric @xmath8 .",
    "if the angle @xmath9 is not zero , and in fact is reasonably large , then the potential exists at conventional long - baseline neutrino beams to measure this rare process and to use it to observe cp violation in the lepton sector and determine the mass hierarchy of neutrinos @xcite .    to first order the appearance of @xmath10 in a pure @xmath0 beam in vacuum",
    "is given by @xmath11 , which is approximately @xmath12 at the atmospheric @xmath13 .",
    "given the chooz bounds @xcite an experiment to observe this transition must be sensitive at the 1% level .",
    "this transition is modified in matter by a factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15  gev is the resonance energy in the earth s crust at the atmospheric @xmath8 .",
    "neutrino ( antineutrino ) transitions are enhanced ( depreciated ) by this factor under the normal mass hierarchy , while the opposite occurs for an inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "this transition is also modified by a factor which depends on the phase @xmath16 of the neutrino mixing matrix , potentially yielding the opportunity to observe a cp - violating difference between @xmath17 and @xmath18 transitions .",
    "figure  [ ellipse ] shows the probabilities for these transitions at an @xmath13 accessible with the numi beam .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the neutrino spectra possible in numi@xcite , both for the initial minos experiment@xcite on - axis , and at three possible off - axis angles , where the resulting neutrino energy from off - axis pion decays becomes rather narrowly peaked and near - independent of pion energy due to two - body decay kinematics@xcite . at 14  mrad ,",
    "the peak is near oscillation maximum , and the intrinsic @xmath10 from the beam is of order 0.4% under the peak ( see figure  [ bckgd ] ) , coming primarily from muon decays . of greater magnitude",
    "is the potential background to a @xmath10 appearance search from neutral current @xmath0 interactions , which leave a small hadronic visible energy in the detector ( see figure  [ bckgd ] ) .",
    "a study of detector designs for an off - axis experiment will be required to assess how frequently these are misidentified as charged current @xmath10 interactions .",
    "the event rate spectra in figures  [ spectra ] and [ bckgd ] are possible with the baseline numi beam design , so that if @xmath19 ( at the chooz limit ) , a 20  kt numi experiment at 712  km with similar @xmath10 efficiency and nc rejection as superk might observe 86 oscillated @xmath10 s in 5 years , with a background of 10 nc s and 10 intrinsic beam @xmath10 . for jhf @xcite , the similar numbers are 123 signal , 11 beam @xmath10 , and 11 nc s in their phase i. note that the lower proton beam power at numi is mitigated by the higher cross sections for 1.8  gev neutrinos . to measure matter effects ( hence the sign of @xmath20 ) or the phase @xmath16 will require running in @xmath21 mode and additional upgrades to the proton beam intensity from the main injector @xcite because of the lower antineutrino event rates",

    "protons of 120  gev are fast - extracted ( spill duration 8.6  @xmath35sec ) from the main injector ( mi ) accelerator and bent downward by 58  mrad toward soudan , mn .",
    "the beamline is designed to accept @xmath36  protons per pulse ( ppp ) .",
    "the spill repetition rate is 0.45  hz , giving @xmath37  protons on target per year .",
    "the main injector is fed up to 6 batches from the booster accelerator , of which 5 batches are extracted to numi . it is likely that when main injector operates at full intensity in multi - batch mode it will have @xmath38 , and emittances up to 40@xmath39  mm - mrad .",
    "initiatives to produce higher intensity beam from the main injector without constructing a proton driver upgrade , including barrier rf stacking of more than 6 booster batches , could increase the beam intensity by a factor of 1.5 at the expense of some emittance growth .",
    "the numi optics will maintain losses below @xmath40 .",
    "a recent redesign of the primary beamline replaced a long free drift region with a fodo lattice , increasing the momentum acceptance to @xmath41 at 40@xmath39  mm - mr .",
    "injection errors of @xmath421  mm lead to targeting errors of @xmath420.5  mm .",
    "the beamline has 21 bpm s of 50  @xmath35 m accuracy , 19 dipole correctors , and 10 retractable secondary emission foil profile+halo monitors .",
    "the primary beam is focused onto a graphite production target @xcite of 6.4@xmath43 20@xmath43  940  mm@xmath44 segmented longitudinally into 47 fins .",
    "the target is water cooled via stainless steel lines at the top and bottom of each fin and is contained in an aluminum vacuum can with beryllium windows .",
    "it is electrically isolated so it can be read out as a budal monitor @xcite .",
    "the target has a safety factor of about 1.6 for the fatigue lifetime of 10@xmath45 pulses ( 1 numi year ) given the calculated dynamic stress of @xmath46  protons / pulse and 1  mm spot size .",
    "a prototype target was tested in the main injector at peak energy densities exceeding that expected in numi .",
    "studies indicate that the existing numi target could withstand up to a 1  mw proton beam if the beam spot size is increased from 1  mm to 3  mm @xcite .",
    "the particles produced in the target are focused by two magnetic horns @xcite .",
    "the 200  ka peak current produces a toroidal field which sign- and momentum - selects the particles from the target .",
    "the relative placement of the two horns and the target optimizes the momentum focus for pions to a particular momentum , hence the peak neutrino beam energy .",
    "the neutrino spectra from two energy settings , called the low energy ( le ) and medium energy ( me ) beams , are shown in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "to fine - tune the beam energy , the target is mounted on a rail - drive system with 2.5  m of travel along the beam direction , permitting remote change of the beam energy without accessing the horns and target @xcite .",
    "measurements on a horn prototype show the expected @xmath47 fall - off of the field to within a percent .",
    "the horns are designed to withstand 10@xmath45 pulses ( 1 numi year ) , and tests of the prototype horn have so far achieved this .",
    "the particles are focused forward by the horns into a 675  m long , 2  m diameter steel pipe evacuated to @xmath42  0.1  torr .",
    "this length is approximately the decay length of a 10  gev pion .",
    "the entrance window to the decay volume is a spherical bell - shaped steel window 1.8  cm in thickness , with a 1.5  mm thick aluminum window 1  m in diameter at its center where 95% of the entering pions traverse .",
    "the decay volume is surrounded by 2.5 - 3.5  m of concrete shielding .",
    "twelve water cooling lines around the exterior of the decay pipe remove the 150  kw of beam heating .",
    "earlier plans to instrument the decay volume with a current - carrying wire ( called the hadron hose @xcite ) which would provide a toroidal field that continuously focuses pions along the decay pipe length , have been abandoned due to budget constraints .    at the end of the decay volume",
    "is a beam absorber consisting of a 1.2@xmath431.2@xmath432.4  m@xmath44 water - cooled aluminum core , a 1  m thick layer of steel blocks surrounding the core , followed by a 1.5  m thick layer of concrete blocks .",
    "the core absorbs 65  kw of beam power , but is capable of taking the full proton beam power of 400  kw for up to an hour in the event of a mistargeting . in the event of a proton intensity",
    "upgrade the core would require no modification , but the steel blocks might require cooling .",
    "ionization chambers are used to monitor the secondary beam .",
    "an array is located immediately upstream of the absorber , as well as at three muon pits , one downstream of the absorber , one after 8  m of rock , and a third after an additional 12  m of rock .",
    "these chambers monitor the remnant hadrons at the end of the decay pipe , as well as the tertiary muons from @xmath39 and @xmath48 decays .",
    "when the beam is tuned to the medium energy configuration , the pointing accuracy of the muon stations can align the neutrino beam direction to approximately 50  @xmath35radians in one spill .",
    "beam tests@xcite of these chambers indicate an order of magnitude safety factor in particle flux over the 10@xmath49/cm@xmath3/spill expected in numi before space charge buildup affects their operation .",
    "the numi beam will turn on in 2004 , with the first experiment , minos , ready to take data . beyond minos ,",
    "a potential physics program is to exploit the intense numi beam in an off - axis experiment , where sensitivities to @xmath32 at the percent level would allow competitive measurements to see if this rare transition is large enough for cp violation studies . additionally , the numi physics program is unique and complements that at the jhf in that matter effects and the neutrino mass hierarchy may be explicitely studied along with the potential cp - violating phase @xmath16 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my numi / minos colleagues , particularly jim hylen , bruce baller , dixon bogert , bob ducar , dave pushka , adam para , debbie harris , mark messier , and karol lang .",
    "many of the oscillations studies grew out of a fermilab study group and a letter of intent written to fermilab this year .",
