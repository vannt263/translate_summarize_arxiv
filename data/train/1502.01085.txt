    "note that the initial state we are using only has short bonds , and by looking at the metastable domain wall quasi - eigenstate we also find that it is dominated by short bonds , very similar to the ground state .",
    "our results show the presence of excited states which are very different and which can be components of the initial state ( which they have to be in order to appear as a result of the pqmc procedure ) , at least in part because of the over - completeness and non - orthogonality of the vb basis . the total fraction of bonds longer than @xmath75 , i.e. , those that can generate changes in the winding number , is graphed versus the system size in fig .",

    "[ fig9 ] shows results for @xmath53 as well as the extreme case of @xmath111 .",
    "we find @xmath171 for @xmath53 and @xmath172 for @xmath111 ( with error bars on the exponents of about 10% ) . in the effective real - time model , with the critical domain wall energy scaling as @xmath173 , the form ( [ decayrate ] ) of the decay rate derived in the vbs ( where the energy difference scales as @xmath4 ) becomes @xmath174 at @xmath53",
    "the exponent @xmath175 remains positive with the values of @xmath109 and @xmath21 obtained above , and , thus , the transition rate out of the original @xmath79 sector in real time is exponentially small .",
    "interesting , for @xmath111 our results suggest @xmath176 ( within estimated error bars ) and if this exponent indeed vanishes , and if the two - state model is to be taken seriously ( which perhaps is asking too much of it in this extreme case ) , then the high - winding states would actually have a shorter than exponentially long life time at the critical point .",
    "going to coupling ratios @xmath177 , entering the antiferromagnetic state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , the winding number sectors should become completely unstable .",
    "indeed , here the energy above the ground state computed with different @xmath178 quickly decays to @xmath103 and , unlike the results at @xmath149 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , it is not possible to discern any converged functional form .",
    "we have demonstrated a mechanism of decay of domain walls in a vb solid state of a quantum spin system , through fluctuations of the topological winding number which effectively counts the number of domain walls in a system .",
    "the mechanism requires the wave function to contain vbs of length proportional to the system size , which is explicitly excluded in an effective description of vb solids with a qdm .",
    "the domain walls become stable in the thermodynamic limit , or , in other words , the winding number is an emergent conserved quantum number .",
    "the life time in imaginary time scales as a power of the system size and we have argued , based on a simple two - state model for two winding sectors , that this translates into an exponentially small transition rate out of an initial winding - number sector in real time .    at a critical point separating the vb solid and an antiferromagnetic ground state ( the putative deconfined quantum - critical point @xcite ) , we have also found stable winding numbers in the thermodynamic limit and a power - law decay of the excitation energy with the system size .",
    "the energy decay exponent contains information on the spectrum of the effective @xmath170 gauge - field model describing this phase transition , and our quantitative results from the power - law scaling , along with exponents obtained previously for other quantities,@xcite lend support to the @xmath179 field theory of deconfined quantum - criticality.@xcite it would be interesting to study in detail the domain wall energy in the whole range of states between the maximally ordered vb solid and the critical point , to make further quantitative comparisons with the theory .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the consequences of long vbs in spin liquid phases as well ( noting that the critical point we have consider corresponds to an algebraic spin liquid at an isolated point ) . to our knowledge , the expected quasi - degenerate topological multiplet has never been observed in su(2 ) invariant @xmath180 spin - liquid candidate hamiltonians @xcite ( which are amenable to vb descriptions and whose topological numbers should be similar to the even - odd winding discussed in ref .  ) .",
    "this could be due to the splitting being relatively large , perhaps still exponentially small but with a large prefactor , or there could be some cross - over from a different form when the system size is still relatively small and the effects of longer vbs could be significant . it should be noted here that , because of the over - completeness of the vb basis , to fix the winding number of an initial state it must overlap with states also outside the subspace of the topological multiplet of a gaped spin liquid .",
    "some of these states may also have an enhanced fraction of long vbs , as we found here in the transitional states out of simple short - bond domain wall states .",
    "spin liquids in frustrated spin models can not be investigated with the pqmc methods we have used here , due to sign problems , but it may be possible to study this issue with exact diagonalization techniques based on vbs,@xcite though the limitation in system size may make it difficult to clearly observe the effects of long bonds",

    "<S> we study the mechanism of decay of a topological ( winding - number ) excitation due to finite - size effects in a two - dimensional valence - bond solid state , realized in an @xmath0 spin model ( @xmath1-@xmath2 model ) with six - spin interactions and studied using projector monte carlo simulations in the valence bond basis . a topological excitation with winding number @xmath3 contains domain walls , which are unstable due to the emergence of long valence bonds in the wave function , unlike in effective descriptions with the quantum dimer model ( which by construction includes only short bonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the life time of the winding number in imaginary time , which is directly accessible in the simulations , diverges as a power of the system length @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy can be computed within this time ( i.e. , it converges toward a `` quasi - eigenvalue '' before the winding number decays ) and agrees for large @xmath4 with the domain - wall energy computed in an open lattice with boundary modifications enforcing a domain wall . constructing a simplified two - state model which can be solved in real and imaginary time , and using the imaginary - time behavior from the simulations as input , we find that the real - time decay rate out of the initial winding sector is exponentially small in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the winding number rapidly becomes a well - defined conserved quantum number for large systems , supporting the conclusions reached by computing the energy quasi - eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> including heisenberg exchange interactions which brings the system to a quantum - critical point separating the valence - bond solid from an antiferromagnetic ground state ( the putative `` deconfined '' quantum - critical point ) , we can also converge the domain wall energy here and find that it decays as a power - law of the system size . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the winding number is an emergent quantum number also at the critical point , with all winding number sectors becoming degenerate in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the description of the critical point in terms of a u(1 ) gauge - field theory . </S>"
