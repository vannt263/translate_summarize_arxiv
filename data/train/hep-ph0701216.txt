    "during the recent years , we have seen a tremendous progress in @xmath3 physics @xcite .",
    "the data agree globally with the kobayashi  maskawa ( km ) mechanism of cp violation , i.e.  with the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , we have also hints for discrepancies , which could be first signals of new physics ( np ) .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties are still too large to draw firm conclusions .",
    "thanks to the start of the lhc , exciting new perspectives will arise in the autumn of 2007 , also for @xmath3-decay studies @xcite . the lhcb experiment will allow us to fully exploit the physics potential of the @xmath1-meson system , and precision determinations of the angle @xmath15 of the unitarity triangle will become possible , , @xmath16 notation . ] which are a key ingredient for the search of np in the flavour sector .",
    "let us therefore have a closer look at @xmath1 decays into final states with charm , which is the topic of wg5 of the ckm2006 workshop , where this talk was given .",
    "the notation and formulae for the cp asymmetries in decays of neutral @xmath17 mesons ( @xmath18 ) are given as follows @xcite : @xmath19,\\label{acp - timedep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denote the  direct \" and  mixing - induced \" cp - violating observables , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 , which should be accessible in the @xmath1-meson system because of the expected sizeable width difference @xmath22 , satisfies @xmath23 these observables are governed by @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the @xmath25@xmath26 mixing phases @xmath27 are an important input for the following discussion .",
    "the data for the cp violation in @xmath28 ( and similar decays ) imply @xmath29 @xcite . performing a measurement of the untagged , time - dependent three - angle distribution of the @xmath30\\phi[\\to k^+k^-]$ ] decay products @xcite ,",
    "the d0 collaboration has recently reported the following result @xcite : @xmath31 consequently , this phase is still not stringently constrained .",
    "however , it is very accessible at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the determinations of the @xmath32 work also in the presence of cp - violating np contributions to @xmath25@xmath26 mixing , provided we have negligible contributions of this kind to the corresponding decay amplitudes , which is a very plausible ( and testable , see below ) assumption for the @xmath28 and @xmath33 decays . for the following discussion",
    ", we hence assume that the @xmath32 are known .",
    "in this section , we have a fresh look at the strategies proposed in @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath2-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions , which relates down and strange quarks in the same way as the isospin symmetry relates down and up quarks , is used to extract @xmath15 from @xmath34 decays with tree and penguin contributions .",
    "the conceptual advantage of these @xmath2-spin strategies is  in contrast to the  conventional \" @xmath35 flavour - symmetry strategies  that no additional dynamical assumptions , such as the neglect of annihilation topologies , have to be made .      in the sm",
    ", the decay amplitudes of @xmath37 and @xmath28 channels can be written as follows : @xmath38\\\\ a(b^0_d\\to j/\\psi k_{\\rm",
    "s})&= & \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}\\right){\\cal a}'\\left[1+\\epsilon a'e^{i\\theta'}e^{i\\gamma } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are cp - conserving strong quantities . the untagged rates @xmath41 allow us to introduce @xmath42 where phsp denotes a straightforward phase - space factor .",
    "on the other hand , tagged , time - dependent rate measurements allow us to extract @xmath43 as well as @xmath44 @xmath45 it is an important feature of the @xmath36 system that the corresponding decays are related through the interchange of all down and strange quarks .",
    "the @xmath2-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions hence implies : @xmath46 consequently , ( [ a - rel ] ) and ( [ a - thet - rel ] ) allow us to determine the quantity @xmath47 introduced in ( [ h - def ] ) . here",
    "@xmath2-spin - breaking corrections to ( [ a - rel ] ) have the most important impact : @xmath48 whereas corrections to ( [ a - thet - rel ] ) play a minor rle because of the @xmath49 suppression in ( [ h - def ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath15 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 can be extracted from @xmath47 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "illustration of the extraction of @xmath15 and @xmath50 from the @xmath36 system through contours in the @xmath15@xmath50 plane.,scaledwidth=27.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bspsik - cont ] , we illustrate this determination : using @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 as input parameters , we obtain @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these observables can be converted into the contours shown in the figure , where the one following from the cp asymmetries @xmath61 and @xmath62 is _ theoretically _ clean .",
    "the intersection of the two contours allows a transparent extraction of @xmath15 and @xmath50 ( we have excluded additional solutions arising for unphysically large values of @xmath63 ) .",
    "another interesting aspect of this strategy is that we have so far not used the @xmath4@xmath5 mixing phase @xmath8 . the @xmath2-spin relation ( [ a - thet - rel ] ) allows us  in combination with the extracted values of @xmath15 , @xmath50 and @xmath51  to control the penguin uncertainties affecting the determination of @xmath8 from ( [ acpmix - bdpsik ] ) .",
    "these corrections received quite some attention @xcite , and can actually be controlled at the lhc through the data for the @xmath64 channel . for the practical implementation ,",
    "also the @xmath2-spin relation @xmath65 is very useful .",
    "the strategy discussed above has also a counterpart in the @xmath1-meson system .",
    "as we noted above , @xmath9 can be extracted from @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "since we have two vector mesons in the final state , the cp eigenstates have to be disentangled through the @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath68 $ ] angular distribution . here",
    "it is convenient to introduce linear polarization states @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( cp even ) ; @xmath72 ( cp odd)@xmath73 , which allow us to write @xmath74.\\ ] ] as @xmath75 in the sm , the penguin effects have a significant impact in this case , at least at the 20% level ( which may be enhanced through final - state interaction effects ) .",
    "therefore , the question of how to control these effects arises , which is particularly relevant for lhcb upgrade plans .",
    "these uncertainties can actually be controlled through an analysis of the @xmath76 , @xmath66 system @xcite : using @xmath8 and the @xmath2-spin symmetry , @xmath15 and the hadronic parameters @xmath77 can be extracted , allowing us to include the penguins in the extraction of @xmath9 .      in the sm , the decay amplitudes take the form @xmath79\\\\",

    "we may then , as in ( [ h - def ] ) , introduce a quantity @xmath82 furthermore , we may write @xmath83 as well as @xmath84 @xmath85 since the @xmath86 decays are again related through the interchange of all @xmath87 and @xmath88 quarks , the @xmath2-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions implies @xmath89 consequently , ( [ a - rel - d ] ) and ( [ a - thet - rel - d ] ) allow us to determine @xmath90 , where the @xmath2-spin - breaking corrections to ( [ a - rel - d ] ) have the most important impact : @xmath91 because of the @xmath49 suppression in ( [ htilde - def ] ) , corrections to ( [ a - thet - rel - d ] ) play a minor rle .",
    "finally , we may extract @xmath15 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 from the measured values of @xmath90 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdd - cont ] . in this example , we have used the input parameters @xmath54 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which yield the observables @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "it should be noted that the contour following from @xmath102 , @xmath103 is _ theoretically _ clean .",
    "illustration of the extraction of @xmath15 and @xmath92 from the @xmath104 system through contours in the @xmath15@xmath92 plane.,scaledwidth=27.0% ]    an interesting by - product of this strategy is that we can now also control the penguin effects in the extraction of @xmath9 from ( [ amixbsdsds ] ) .",
    "this avenue provides an attractive alternative to the conventional determination of the @xmath6@xmath7 mixing phase through the @xmath66 angular analysis .",
    "the determination of @xmath15 from @xmath105 tree decays suffers currently from large uncertainties : @xmath106   ( 82\\pm 20)^\\circ & \\mbox{(utfit ) . } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] this unfavourable situation can be significantly improved at lhcb @xcite , where also @xmath1 decays into final states with charm play an important rle .",
    "the key feature of these decays is that both a @xmath25 and a @xmath109 meson may decay into the same final state @xmath110 , thereby leading to interference between mixing and decay processes .",
    "this phenomenon brings @xmath32 and @xmath15 into the game , which enter actually in the combination @xmath111 . in the case of @xmath112 ,",
    "corresponding to the final states @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the interference effects are governed by a hadronic parameter @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the usual side of the unitarity triangle , and are hence large . on the other hand , for @xmath117 with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , a doubly cabibbo - suppressed hadronic parameter @xmath120 enters , which leads to tiny interference effects .",
    "if the @xmath121 and @xmath122 terms of the time - dependent decay rates are measured , @xmath111 can be extracted in a theoretically clean way @xcite . since",
    "the mixing phases @xmath32 are known , this determination can be converted into a measurement of @xmath15 .",
    "however , the practical implementation is affected by problems : we encounter an eightfold discrete ambiguity for @xmath111 , which has to be resolved for the search of np .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath117 case , an additional input is required to extract @xmath123 , since @xmath124 interference effects would have to be resolved , which is impossible .    as was pointed out in @xcite , a combined analysis of @xmath125 and @xmath126",
    "allows us to resolve these problems with the help of the @xmath2-spin symmetry . in this strategy , where @xmath123 has not to be fixed and @xmath127 enters only through a @xmath128 correction , which can be determined through untagged @xmath1 rates , an unambiguous value of @xmath15 can be extracted",
    "the first studies for lhcb are very promising @xcite , and are currently further refined .",
    "these transitions are the colour - suppressed counterparts of the @xmath107 channels .",
    "if we consider the cp eigenstates @xmath132 of the neutral @xmath133 mesons , we may introduce the following untagged rate asymmetry @xcite : @xmath134 which allows us to constrain @xmath15 through @xmath135 .",
    "additional observables are provided by the coefficients @xmath136 and @xmath137 of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 terms of the cp asymmetries , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to define the following combinations : @xmath138,\\ , \\langle s_{f_s}\\rangle_\\pm\\equiv\\frac{1}{2}\\left[s_+^{f_s}\\pm s_-^{f_s}\\right].\\ ] ] an unambiguous determination of @xmath15 is then possible with the help of the following expression @xcite : @xmath139+\\bigl[\\eta_{f_s}\\langle s_{f_s}\\rangle_-- \\sin\\phi_q\\bigr],\\ ] ] where @xmath140 depends on the angular momentum @xmath141 of the @xmath142 final state .",
    "let us finally have a look at the @xmath143 counterparts of the @xmath129 , @xmath130 , ... and @xmath131 modes .",
    "the relevant interference effects are governed by hadronic parameters @xmath144 .",
    "consequently , these decays are not promising for the extraction of @xmath15 .",
    "however , since their observable combinations @xmath145 , which are defined in analogy to ( [ cpm - spm ] ) , satisfy the simple relation @xmath146 they offer extremely clean extractions of @xmath147 @xcite . in comparison with the @xmath66 and @xmath10 determinations ,",
    "the theoretical accuracy is one order of magnitude higher .",
    "moreover , as no penguin contributions are present , these determinations are very robust with respect to np effects at the decay amplitude level , which is an interesting topic in view of the low value of @xmath148 and the  tension \" in the fits of the unitarity triangle",
    ". in particular , np effects entering through @xmath4@xmath5 mixing or through tiny effects at the @xmath149 amplitude level ( for instance , through penguin - like topologies ) could be distinguished this way .",
    "decays of @xmath1 mesons into final states with charm offer various determinations of @xmath15 . in these strategies ,",
    "the @xmath2-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions provides a powerful tool , allowing us to fully exploit the physics potential of the @xmath1 mesons through a simultaneous analysis of the @xmath2-spin related @xmath150 decays .",
    "we also encountered interesting  by - products \" for the @xmath3-physics programme at the lhc , including ways to control the penguin uncertainties in the extractions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 from @xmath28 and @xmath151 , respectively , which seem to be particularly relevant for lhcb upgrade plans , and an alternative determination of @xmath9 with the help of @xmath152 .",
    "the cleanest determinations of the mixing phases @xmath9 and @xmath8 are offered by the pure tree decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively",
    ". these channels would be very interesting for the search of np , but are unfortunately extremely challenging for lhcb . on the other hand , they may be accessible at an @xmath153 super-@xmath3 factory .",
