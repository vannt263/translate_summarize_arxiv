    "very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath1-ray  astronomy is the term used to describe observations in the energy range from 300gev to 100tev .",
    "ground - based instruments operating in this energy domain typically have large collecting areas , good angular resolution and relatively large fields of view .",
    "the atmospheric erenkov  imaging technique is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "twenty five years of gamma ray observations in the mev to gev range , have produced nearly 300 cataloged sources . during its lifetime ,",
    "the egret experiment aboard cgro made the most significant contribution to the list of detected sources , although its relative insensitivity to the arrival direction of 100 mev photons means that the location of many sources are only known to within @xmath2 .",
    "the majority of sources are , as yet , not firmly associated with objects at other wavelengths . in many cases the egret error circle is populated by a number of prospective x - ray , optical and radio sources which are all candidate associations .",
    "observations of eight unidentified egret sources , listed in table [ obs::sources ] , were made with the whipple 10 m imaging atmospheric erenkov  telescope in arizona usa .",
    "the instrument and its characteristics are described in @xcite . for off - axis and extended sources the telescope is operated in on - off mode .",
    "each 28 minute scan of the source region is followed by a 28 minute control run offset from the source by 30 minutes in right ascension and in time .",
    "taking the control data in this manner compensates for differences in brightness that are a function of elevation and azimuth ."
