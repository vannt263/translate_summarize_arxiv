    "in this introductory section , we will present the related background for introducing the concept of skew energy for oriented graphs .",
    "some basic definitions are also given .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple undirected graph on order @xmath5 with vertex set @xmath6 and edge set @xmath7 .",
    ". then the adjacency matrix of @xmath0 is the @xmath9 symmetric matrix @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 if the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are adjacent , and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath1 be an oriented graph of @xmath0 with the orientation @xmath2 , which assigns to each edge of @xmath0 a direction so that the resultant graph @xmath1 becomes an oriented graph or a directed graph .",
    "then @xmath0 is called the underlying graph of @xmath1 .",
    "the skew - adjacency matrix of @xmath1 is the @xmath9 matrix @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 if @xmath18 is an arc of @xmath1 , otherwise @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath3 is a skew - symmetric matrix .",
    "actually , this skew - adjacency matrix of an oriented graph @xmath1 was first introduced by tutte @xcite in 1947 , where he defined a matrix @xmath20 $ ] with @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 is an arc of @xmath1 , otherwise @xmath19 , where @xmath24 is a formal variable . using this matrix",
    ", he showed that the graph @xmath0 has a perfect matching if and only if @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , it was proved ( see @xcite for examples ) that the number of perfect matchings in a graph @xmath0 with @xmath26 edges is enumerated by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the set of all oriented graphs of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that when we take every @xmath29 , the resultant matrix is just the skew - adjacency matrix @xmath3 .    among the orientations of a graph @xmath0 ,",
    "the pfaffian orientations play an important role in the enumeration of perfect matchings of @xmath0 .",
    "a pfaffian orientation of @xmath0 is such an orientation for the edges of @xmath0 under which every even cycle @xmath30 of @xmath0 such that @xmath31 has a perfect matching has the property that there are odd number of edges directed in either direction of the cycle @xmath30 . in other words ,",
    "a pfaffian orientation of @xmath0 is such an orientation for the edges of @xmath0 under which every even cycle @xmath30 of @xmath0 such that @xmath31 has a perfect matching is oddly oriented . in 1961 , the physicists fisher @xcite , kasteleyn @xcite and temperley @xcite used the pfaffian orientations of a graph to enumerate the number of perfect matchings in a graph .",
    "it was showed that the number of perfect matchings in @xmath0 is equal to the square root of @xmath32 , where @xmath2 is a pfaffian orientation of @xmath0 . for more on the pfaffian orientations , we refer to robertson , seymour and thomas @xcite ( ann . math . , 1999 ) , and thomas @xcite ( 45min invited speech at the icm 2006 ) .    for an oriented graph @xmath1 of an undirected graph @xmath0 , there is the adjacency matrix @xmath33 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath34 if @xmath35 is an arc of @xmath1 , and @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "it is clear that for the adjacency matrix of @xmath0 , we have @xmath37 ; whereas for the skew - adjacency matrix of @xmath1 , we have @xmath38 . the adjacency matrix @xmath39 of a graph @xmath0 has been well - studied .",
    "it has a characteristic polynomial , and it is symmetric and therefore all its eigenvalues are real . among many topics about it , we mention the energy of a graph , which is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all its eigenvalues .",
    "the concept of the energy was introduced by gutman in @xcite . since in theoretical chemistry , the energy of a given molecular graph is related to the total @xmath40-electron energy of the molecule represented by that graph .",
    "consequently , the graph energy has some specific chemistry interests and has been extensively studied .",
    "we refer to the survey @xcite and the book @xcite for details . up to now",
    ", there are various generalizations of the graph energy , such as the laplacian energy , signless laplacian energy , incidence energy , distance energy , and the laplacian - energy like invariant for undirected graphs .",
    "the skew energy of oriented graphs is another direction of generalization for the energy of graphs .",
    "first of all , we recall some definitions . the characteristic polynomial of a skew - adjacency matrix @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath41 is said to be the skew - characteristic polynomial of the oriented graph @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath42 . from linear algebra",
    "it is known that the eigenvalues of @xmath3 are just the solutions of the equation @xmath43 , which form the spectrum of @xmath3 and are said to be the skew - spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath3 is skew - symmetric , every eigenvalue of @xmath3 is a pure imaginary number or 0 .",
    "analogous to the definition of the energy of a simple undirected graph , the skew energy of an oriented graph @xmath1 , proposed first by adiga , balakrishnan and so @xcite and denoted by @xmath4 , is defined as the sum of the norms of all the eigenvalues of @xmath3 .",
    "there are situations when chemists use digraphs rather than graphs .",
    "one such situation is when vertices represent distinct chemical species and arcs represent the direction in which a particular reaction takes place between the two corresponding species .",
    "so , people hope that this skew energy will have similar applications as energy in chemistry .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ matrix ] , we summarize the results about the skew - characteristic polynomial of oriented graphs . then in section [ properties ] , we collect some basic properties of the skew energy of oriented graphs and state the integral formulas for the skew energy .",
    "section [ bipartite ] is used to survey the results about bipartite graphs with @xmath44 .",
    "general bounds of the skew energy for oriented graphs are given in section [ bound ] , and in which the progress on characterizing the oriented graphs achieving the upper bound are described .",
    "the skew - spectra of various products of graphs are determined in section [ product ] and therein their applications in skew energy are illustrated .",
    "section [ extremal ] outlines some results on extremal oriented graphs with regard to skew energy .",
    "section [ random ] is concerned with the skew energy of random oriented graphs .",
    "the last section , section [ conclude ] , is for concluding remarks . in each of the sections , we propose some open problems for further study .",
    "this section is used to summarize the results about the skew - characteristic polynomials and skew - spectra of oriented graphs .",
    "first we give some definitions .",
    "let @xmath0 be an undirected graph .",
    "an @xmath45-matching of @xmath0 is an edge subset of @xmath45 edges such that every vertex of @xmath0 is incident with at most one edge in it .",

    "let @xmath1 be an oriented graph of @xmath0 and @xmath30 be an undirected even cycle of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath30 is said to be _ evenly oriented _ relative to @xmath1 if it has an even number of edges oriented in clockwise direction ( and now it also has an even number of edges oriented in anticlockwise direction , since @xmath30 is an even cycle ) ; otherwise @xmath30 is _ oddly oriented_.    recall that a linear subgraph @xmath47 of @xmath0 is a disjoint union of some edges and some cycles in @xmath0 .",
    "a linear subgraph @xmath47 of @xmath0 is called _ even linear _",
    "if @xmath47 contains no odd cycle , i.e. , the number of vertices of @xmath47 is even .",
    "denote by @xmath48 the set of all evenly linear subgraphs of @xmath0 with @xmath49 vertices .",
    "these definitions in undirected graphs are the same as that in oriented graphs . for a linear subgraph @xmath50 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath51 and @xmath52 the number of evenly oriented cycles and oddly oriented cycles in @xmath47 relative to @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath1 be an oriented graph of a graph @xmath0 with the skew - adjacency matrix @xmath3 .",
    "let the skew - characteristic polynomial @xmath42 of @xmath1 be @xmath53 the following theorem , obtained by hou and lei in @xcite , characterizes the coefficients of skew - characteristic polynomial of an oriented graph , which is analogous to the famous sachs theorem @xcite for an undirected graph .",
    "@xcite[coefficient ] let @xmath1 be an oriented graph of a graph @xmath0 with the skew - characteristic polynomial @xmath54",
    ". then @xmath55 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the number of evenly oriented cycles and the number of oddly oriented cycles of @xmath47 relative to @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for all odd @xmath49 .    in @xcite , gong , li and",

    ". therefore , for an oriented graph with no even cycles , its skew - characteristic polynomial has a special form as follows .",
    "@xcite[noeven ] let @xmath0 be an undirected graph with no even cycles and @xmath1 be an oriented graph of @xmath0 .",

    "it should be noted that gong and xu @xcite considered weighted oriented graphs .",

    "besides , cavers et al .",
    "@xcite obtained more general results by considering weighted diagraphs which allows loops and dicycles of length @xmath70 .",
    "in this section , we first state some basic properties of the skew energy of oriented graphs , which can be directly derived from definition together with elementary knowledge of linear algebra .",
    "then we state the integral formulas for the skew energy in terms of the skew - characteristic polynomial , which play a key role in determining the extremal oriented graphs for skew energy in given graph classes .",
    "it is known that for any undirected graph with @xmath26 edges , there are @xmath71 different orientations .",

    "another oriented graph @xmath72 of @xmath0 , obtained from @xmath1 by reversing the orientations of all arcs between @xmath74 and @xmath76 , is said to be obtained from @xmath1 by switching with respect to @xmath74 .",

    "if @xmath1 and @xmath72 are switching - equivalent , then @xmath1 and @xmath72 have the same spectra and hence @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath77 be a labeled oriented tree rooted at vertex @xmath66 .",
    "it is showed that , through reversing the orientations of all arcs incident at some vertices other than @xmath66 , one can transform @xmath77 to another oriented tree @xmath78 in which the orientations of all arcs go from low labels to high labels . by using this and theorem [ reverse ] , adiga , balakrishnan and so in @xcite deduced some results on the skew energy of oriented trees .",
    "@xcite the skew energy of an oriented tree is independent of its orientation .",
    "@xcite [ tree ] the skew energy of an oriented tree is the same as the energy of its underlying tree .",
    "it follows that all results about the energy of undirected trees can be immediately copied to the skew energy of oriented trees .",

    "we would like to propose the following problems :    is there any other changing of the directions of some arcs that does not change the skew energy of an oriented graph ?",
    "is there any changing of the directions of some arcs that increases the skew energy of an oriented graph ? or more difficultly , is there a sequence of arcs such that if we successively change the directions of the arcs , then the skew energy increases every step ?",
    "another interesting problem is the following one :    how to construct families of oriented graphs such that they have equal skew energy but they do not have the same spectra ?",
    "next we will present the explicit expression of the skew energy for an oriented cycle @xmath86 . fix a vertex and",
    "label the vertices of @xmath86 successively . reversing the arcs incident to a vertex if necessary",
    ", we obtain a new oriented cycle with arcs going from low labels to high labels possibly except one arc .",

    "@xcite let @xmath87 be the oriented cycle with the same directions for all arcs and @xmath88 be the oriented cycle with same directions for all arcs except one arc .",
