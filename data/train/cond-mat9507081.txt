    "in this article we develop a quasiclassical method for studying the influence of disorder on magnetooscillations in 2d electronic systems .",
    "our original motivation was the problem of quantum particles in random magnetic fields which has attracted considerable interest during the last few years .",
    "only quite recently realizations of a random magnetic field acting on a 2d electron gas have been prepared and investigated .",
    "one possible way of generating a random magnetic field is to use a type ii disordered superconductor with randomly pinned flux lines in an external magnetic field as the substrate for the 2d electron gas @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may use a magnetically active substrate such as a demagnetized ferromagnet with randomly oriented magnetic domains @xcite .",
    "the main interest in the random magnetic field problem derives , however , from effective field theories of interacting electron systems , for which the interaction may be shown to be mediated by fictitious gauge fields .",
    "the first example of this class is the gauge field theory of high@xmath0 superconductivity compounds @xcite .",
    "there the gauge fields arise as a tool to implement the projection of the hilbert space onto a subspace of states without double occupancy of lattice sites .",
    "these gauge fields are long  range correlated , with correlation function diverging as @xmath1 for wavevector @xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to a short  range correlated random magnetic field .",
    "the second example is provided by the composite fermion picture of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite . there",
    "the electrons are represented by fermions with an even number of magnetic flux tubes attached . at half - filling of the lowest landau band ,",
    "the average field due to the flux tubes cancels the external magnetic field , leaving the problem of fermions moving in a random magnetic field generated by the flux tubes .",
    "the correlations of the corresponding vector potential are also long - ranged .    for a short - range correlated magnetic field , implying a long - range correlated vector potential , the total scattering rate of a charged quantum particle diverges in born approximation @xcite .",
    "this is due to the divergence of the differential scattering cross - section for forward scattering .",
    "the usual self - consistent treatment of strong scattering has been shown to be insufficient @xcite , as it violates gauge invariance .",
    "the dominance of small angle scattering calls for a quasiclassical description .",
    "we therefore employ the quasiclassical approximation method for the path integral representation of this problem .",
    "an additional advantage of the path integral formalism is the explicit gauge invariance , in contrast to the usual perturbation theory methods .    for the 2d @xmath3 heterostructures on which the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite is observed ,",
    "the quasiclassical treatment is appropriate for the following resasons . in these systems , the donors are located in a remote layer separated by a large distance @xmath4 from the electron gas plane .",
    "thus , the random potential created by these impurities has a large correlation length @xmath5 , and the small  angle scattering dominates , which can be properly described within the quasiclassical approximation . in a strong magnetic field , such that the landau level filling factor @xmath6 is close to @xmath7 , a statistical transformation can be applied as mentioned above , converting the electrons into so - called composite fermions @xcite",
    ". then a random magnetic field appears , on top of the smooth random potential .",
    "the quasiclassical path integral approach allows to study the effect of both types of random field on equal footing .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we use the path integral formalism to calculate the total and the transport scattering rates in long  range correlated random potentials .",
    "we check that the obtained results are in agreement with the conventional perturbation theory . in section 3",
    "we study the influence of a long  range random potential on the oscillations of the density of states and the conductivity in a magnetic field . in section 4",
    "we generalize the results of the two preceding sections on the case of a random magnetic field ( rather than random potential ) .",
    "finally , in section 5 we apply the above formalism to the system of composite fermions in the fqhe device near @xmath8 , where both long  range random potential and random magnetic field are important .",
    "section 6 contains a discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "some of the results of this article have been published in the form of short communications @xcite .",
    "in this section we develop the quasiclassical path integral formalism and apply it to the calculation of total and transport scattering rates in a random potential with large correlation length .",
    "these results can also be obtained within conventional perturbation theory , so that this section has mainly methodological character .",
    "it is instructive , however , to see how the quasiclassical treatment reproduces results of the perturbation theory , in the case when both are applicable .",
    "we consider a quantum particle of mass @xmath9 and energy @xmath10 moving in 2d in a static random potential @xmath11 with gaussian distribution characterized by the correlation function @xmath12 we assume @xmath13 to be a smooth function of @xmath14 depending on the absolute value @xmath15 only , with a characteristic length scale @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the wave length ( we set @xmath18 throughout the paper ) .",
    "we review first results of the standard perturbation theory .",
    "the total scattering rate can be found in the born approximation as @xmath19 where @xmath20 ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 eq.([2 ] ) can be transformed as follows @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the density of states ( dos ) on the fermi surface and @xmath25 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the above assumption of the long  range character of @xmath26 , @xmath16 , allows to approximate the bessel function in ( [ 4 ] ) by its asymptotic expression , yielding @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the fermi velocity .",
    "this result holds under the condition of applicability of the born approximation , which is @xmath29    expression for the transport scattering rate @xmath30 differs from that for @xmath31 by an additional factor @xmath32 .",
    "we have thus , in full analogy with eq.([4 ] ) , @xmath33w(r)\\ . \\label{6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using now the relations @xmath34 ; @xmath35'=zj_0(z)$ ] and integrating by part , we reduce eq.([6 ] ) to the form @xmath36 for a long range potential , @xmath16 , we find thus @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\ & & = -{m\\over p_f^3}\\int_0^\\infty dr { w'(r)\\over r } \\label{8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last line we used the assumption that @xmath26 is an analytic function of @xmath14 at @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 .",
    "in the remaining part of this section we rederive eqs.([5 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) in the path integral approach @xcite . to calculate @xmath40",
    ", we consider the ( retarded ) single  particle green function @xmath41\\right\\ } \\label{9}\\ ] ] after averaging over the disorder ( which we will denote by angular brackets ) , we get @xmath42\\right\\ } \\label{10}\\ ] ] in the absence of the second term in the exponent , eq.([10 ] ) describes the free particle green function @xmath43 , which can be found exactly by the saddle  point method .",
    "the saddle point is given by the classical trajectory @xmath44 ; @xmath45 , which yields in 2d @xmath46 we use now the fact that the correlator @xmath26 is smooth , and thus the full expression ( [ 10 ] ) can still be evaluated quaiclassically .",
    "furthermore , we assume the random potential to be relatively weak , so that the second term in the action in ( [ 10 ] ) can be considered as a perturbation .",
    "formally , this means @xmath47 .",
    "then the effect of the random potential term is given by its value on the saddle  point trajectory .",
    "assuming now @xmath48 , as in eq.([6 ] ) , we get @xmath49 with @xmath40 as in eq.([5 ] ) .",
    "we find therefore that _ the single particle relaxation rate can be simply found by evaluating the random potential  induced term in the action on a classical trajectory . _    as we will see now , calculation of the transport time in this formalism is much more elaborate .",
    "we start from the kubo formula for the conductivity @xmath50\\hat{v}_x[g_r(e)-g_a(e)]\\rangle \\label{13}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the system volume , @xmath52 is velocity operator and @xmath53 , @xmath54 denote retarded and advanced green functions respectively . as usual , the leading contribution is given by the terms @xmath55 , which can be rewritten in time representation as @xmath56 the product of the green function can be expressed in terms of the path integral , in analogy with eq.([10 ] ) ( we omit here the vertex velocity operators for simplicity and restore them in the end of calculation ) : @xmath57 - { 1\\over 2 } \\int_0^{t_2 } \\int_0^{t_2 } dt\\ , dt'\\ , w[\\bbox{r_2}(t)-\\bbox{r_2}(t ' ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left .",

    "the saddle point trajectory for the action in ( [ 15 ] ) is @xmath58 however , this does not give the leading contribution to ( [ 15 ] ) . in mathematical terms , the failure of the usual saddle point approximation is related to the fact that for @xmath59 and @xmath60 close to each other ( this condition is implied by the factor @xmath61 in eq.([14 ] ) ) the impurity  induced terms in the action in ( [ 15 ] ) nearly cancel each other on this trajectory .",
    "moreover , this happens always , when @xmath62 and @xmath63 traverse the same trajectory in the same time , so that the vicinities of all such trajectories may be expected to be relevant . physically speaking ,",
    "this is because the conductivity is determined by the time scale in which the direction of velocity of the particle changes by an angle of order @xmath64 .",
    "since in a long  range potential small  angle scattering is typical , this happens after many scattering events .",
    "the corresponding classical trajectory is smooth , but globally is typically very different from a straight line .",
    "these considerations suggest to study contributions from a class of paths @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which fluctuate by a small amount about a common smooth , but otherwise arbitrary , trajectory @xmath67 , traversed with a constant ( by absolute value ) velocity @xmath68 .",
    "though these trajectories are not really saddle points of the action , they are `` nearly saddle points '' and can be expected to dominate the path integral .",
    "thus , we represent the two paths @xmath65 and @xmath66 in ( [ 15 ] ) in the form @xmath69 where we define @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the variable @xmath72 in eq.([16a ] ) is confined to the interval @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "note that the typical values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are expected to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 .",
    "now we expand the action ( [ 15 ] ) in @xmath79 .",
    "the leading contribution from the kinetic energy terms reads : @xmath80 for the disorder  induced terms in the action ( [ 15 ] ) we use the taylor expansion @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 $ ] . then the last three terms in ( [ 15 ] ) combine to @xmath84\\over|\\bbox{\\rho}(t)-\\bbox{\\rho}(t')| } r_-^\\bot(t)r_-^\\bot(t ' ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -&{1\\over 2}\\int_0^{t_+}\\int_0^{t_+}dt\\,dt ' w''[|\\bbox{\\rho}(t)-\\bbox{\\rho}(t')| ] r_-^\\|(t)r_-^\\|(t ' ) \\label{19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we separated the fluctuations @xmath79 into the longitudinal @xmath85 and transverse @xmath86 parts with respect to the direction of velocity @xmath87 .",
    "as is expected on physical grounds and will be justified below , the relevant trajectories have nearly constant absolute value of velocity @xmath88 .",
    "we also expect , in view of eq.([5a ] ) , the fluctuations @xmath89 to be varying slowly on the time scale @xmath90 .",
    "then eq.([19 ] ) reduces to @xmath91 with @xmath92 and assuming again @xmath93 . finally , substituting ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) into eq.([14 ] ) , we get @xmath94 we integrate first over the longitudinal fluctuations @xmath85 .",
    "this produces the @xmath95function @xmath96 , thus restricting the integral to the trajectories @xmath97 with constant velocity @xmath98 , as was expected .",
    "further , the integral over @xmath74 gives then @xmath99 , fixing the value of @xmath100 .",

    "we apply the method to the situation when the perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "we consider a 2d gas of charged particles subject to a uniform magnetic field @xmath114 and a smooth random potential @xmath11 defined by eq.([1 ] ) . we will assume the impurity scattering to be relatively weak , so that @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "our quasiclassical treatment will be valid for a random potential with correlation length @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the magnetic length .",
    "eq.([28 ] ) is opposite to the condition of applicability of the self - consistent born approximation @xcite .",
    "the de haas  van alphen oscillations ( dhvao ) of the density of states ( dos ) were studied in this regime in @xcite by approximate summation of all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "we will demonstrate that this can be achieved in a more elegant way from the path integral formalism .",
    "we will also show that the shubnikov  de haas oscillations ( sdho ) of conductivity can be described in this way , as well .",
    "we consider first the dos , which can be found from the single  particle green function ( [ 10 ] ) as @xmath119 in the quasiclassical approximation , the green function @xmath120 can be represented as a sum over closed classical orbits @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 labels the orbits , @xmath123 is a factor originating from the path integration over the vicinity of the classical orbit @xmath122 , and @xmath124 is an action in the energy representation . in the absence of the random potential",
    ", we would have just a free particle in uniform magnetic field .",
    "the classical trajectories are then the cyclotron orbits with radius @xmath125",

    "they are well resolved if @xmath141 . in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath142 , the representation ( [ 36 ] ) is appropriate , where all harmonics except the first one can be omitted : @xmath143 the dependence of the amplitude of oscillations on the magnetic field has the same form @xmath144 as for the short range potential , so that if one plots @xmath145 versus @xmath146 ( so - called dingle plot @xcite ) , one expects to get a linear behavior .    in the case of ultra - long - range potential with @xmath147",
    ", we find @xmath148 .",
    "the landau levels have again a gaussian shape : @xmath149 ^ 2\\right\\}\\ , \\label{39}\\ ] ] which in this case reflects their inhomogeneous broadening . the oscillating part of the dos in eq.([38 ] ) , @xmath150 , is now equal to @xmath151 so that the dingle plot is expected to be quadratic .    as we have already mentioned , the above results for the dos oscillations in a long range potential were obtained in @xcite by resummation of the perturbation theory expansion @xcite .",
    "besides being simpler and physically more transparent , the present derivation has the advantage that it can be straightforwardly generalized to sdho of conductivity or to the case of random magnetic field .",
    "the conductivity oscillations were recently considered in the framework of the path integral approach for the case of short  range random potential ( @xmath152 ) in @xcite .",
    "the authors of these papers started from the kubo formula ( [ 14 ] ) , representing each green function as a sum over classical trajectories in uniform magnetic field and taking scattering into account by including the factor @xmath153 .",
    "a trajectory is characterized by a number of cyclotron revolutions @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , eq.([14 ] ) is reduced to a double sum over the winding numbers @xmath154 .",
    "the non - oscillating contribution to the conductivity corresponds then to the terms with @xmath155 , whereas the @xmath156-th harmonic of the oscillations is described by the terms with @xmath157 .",
    "this holds for our problem of smooth random potential as well .",
    "the only difference is that the relevant trajectories are now not exactly cyclotron circles , but rather are very close to them , however drifting a little from one revolution to another .",
    "the typical total number of revolutions of each trajectory is of order of @xmath115 ; in this time the shift of the center of cyclotron movement for a typical trajectory is of order @xmath158 .",
    "this is completely analogous to the consideration of conductivity in zero magnetic field in section 2 , where the characteristic trajectories dominating the path integral were smooth ( i.e. _ locally _ close to straight lines ) , but not really straight lines .    the non - oscillating contribution @xmath159 to the conductivity is given by the trajectories for @xmath53 and @xmath54 having equal number of cyclotron revolutions and following closely each other within a distance @xmath160 , as in section 2 .",
    "then the impurity  induced terms in ( [ 15 ] ) cancel each other again to a great extent , leading to @xmath161 .",
    "the exact evaluation of the conductivity @xmath159 is however much more complicated in the present situation , since the trajectories return to positions close to the preceding ones after @xmath162 revolutions and may interact through the impurity correlator .",
    "this may lead to a deviation of @xmath163 from its value calculated in zero magnetic field in section 2 .",
    "we leave this problem aside in the present article and concentrate on the exponential damping of the oscillations by disorder .",
    "the leading contribution to oscillations ( the first harmonic ) corresponds to the case when one of the trajectories has one extra cyclotron revolution as compared to another one .",
    "then the contribution to the effective action in ( [ 15 ] ) from this part of the trajectory is not cancelled and leads to a suppression of the amplitude of oscillations .",
    "we get @xmath164 with @xmath132 given by eq.([34 ] ) .",
    "thus , impurity scattering leads to the same @xmath165 exponential damping of the sdho , as for the dos oscillations . depending on the relation between @xmath135 and @xmath158 ,",
    "this factor takes the form @xmath166 as in eqs .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) , ( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "in this section we consider the oscillations of dos and conductivity in the case when the carriers are subject to a random magnetic field rather than to a random potential .",
    "the properties of a quantum particle moving in a random magnetic field have been intensively discussed in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "we are aware by now of three completely different physical systems , for which the random magnetic field problem is relevant . in the first class of system the random magnetic field is generated by a substrate on top of which the 2d electron gas is placed .",
    "realizations of the substrate are a type ii superconductor with randomly pinned flux lines @xcite , or a demagnetized ferromagnet with randomly oriented domains @xcite .",
    "the second is the state with spin  charge separation of high@xmath0 superconducting materials @xcite . to describe it ,",
    "one introduces a fictitious @xmath167 gauge field interacting with charge carriers . here , the transverse ( magnetic ) component of the gauge field is the most important .",
    "the existence of gauge field fluctuations in high-@xmath168 compounds can be inferred @xcite from experimental observations of unusual weak localization corrections to the magnetoconductance @xcite .",
    "finally , the third application concerns the fqhe system in the vicinity of @xmath8 filling factor of the landau level .",
    "this will be studied in more detail in the next section .",
    "we consider a gaussian distributed random magnetic field @xmath169 ( perpendicular to the 2d plane ) with the correlator @xmath170 we will assume the weak disorder case , which means @xmath171 . let us first reconsider the evaluation of scattering rates in section 2 for this type of disorder",
    ". for the one - particle green function we have , instead of ( [ 10 ] ) : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is a vector potential corresponding to the magnetic field @xmath169 .",
    "however , the correlator @xmath174 is gauge - dependent , so that eq.([44 ] ) does not allow to define meaningfully the single particle relaxation time @xmath40 , as it was possible for the random potential case .",
    "we will discuss the problem of definiton of @xmath40 below .",
    "for the transport time , the problem of gauge invariance does not apply .",
    "the analogue of eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) reads @xmath175 where we used the stokes theorem to rewrite the effective action in the explicitly gauge - invariant form . here",
    "@xmath176 is so - called non - oriented , or amprean , area inside the closed curve formed by the two trajectories @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we recall , in particular , that the non - oriented area enclosed by @xmath126 windings of a trajectory is the geometrical area multiplied by @xmath177 .",

    "the quasiclassical method describes correctly only the small angle scattering , so it is able to give an expression for the differential scattering rate @xmath185 for @xmath186 only .",
    "the transport scattering rate @xmath187 can be found in this way up to a numerical coefficient only : @xmath188 .",
    "the exact value can be found from the perturbation theory calculation , which gives @xcite @xmath189 in full agreement with eq.([50 ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath190    as we can see from eqs.([50 ] ) , ( [ 51 ] ) , the total scattering rate @xmath191 diverges at @xmath192 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the contribution @xmath193 to the action from the random magnetic field is proportional to the area , rather than to the length , of the trajectory .",
    "we will see below , when studying dhvao and sdho , that the cyclotron motion of the particle provides a natural regularization of this divergency .",
    "however , this regularization is determined by the geometry of the experiment considered .",
    "thus , _ the single particle relaxation time in the random magnetic field is dependent on the geometry of the problem_.    we turn now to the consideration of magnetooscillations in the case when a uniform magnetic field @xmath114 is applied in addition to the random one . as in section 3 , we will assume a relatively strong field , meaning @xmath115 , or according to eq.([52 ] ) , @xmath194 .",

    "the charge carriers are then characterized by their lattice mass @xmath211 , which for @xmath212 is equal to @xmath213 , @xmath214 being the free electron mass .",
    "the potential @xmath215 , eq.([59 ] ) , gets screened by the 2d electron gas into @xmath216 when writing eq.([60 ] ) , we assumed that the dos determining the screening is practically constant : @xmath217 .",
    "taking into account the magnetooscillations of the dos here would lead to a non - linear screening , see @xcite .",
    "however , since our primary interest is in the region of large @xmath218 where the amplitude of oscillations is small , we can neglect this non - linear effect .",
    "we also assume the impurity positions to be uncorrelated ( see , however , the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "then we find that the total random potential of the impurities is described by the correlator @xmath26 , see eq.([1 ] ) , with the fourier transform @xmath219 according to section 3 , we find then for the amplitude of oscillations @xmath220 with @xmath132 given by eq.([34 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath221 we find @xmath222 whereas for @xmath223 @xmath224 \\ ; \\nonumber\\\\ & & { 1\\over\\tau^*_0}=[2w(0)]^{1/2}= { 1\\over m_b d_s}({\\pi n_i})^{1/2}\\ . \\label{64}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the systems under consideration the usual assumption is that concentrations of donors and charge carriers coincide : @xmath225 .",
    "then the condition of weak oscillations @xmath226 reduces to @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , in the region of small oscillations ( where our derivation is justified ) , eq.([63 ] ) has to be applied .",
    "now we consider the oscillations in strong magnetic field , near half filling of the landau level : @xmath227 .",
    "it was observed experimentally that in this region the longitudinal resisitivity shows oscillations with minima at @xmath228 , very much reminiscent to its behavior in low magnetic fields where conventional sdho take place .",
    "this feature did not find an explanation within the original hierarchy theory of the fqhe @xcite . to explain it , jain @xcite proposed a concept based on converting the electrons into composite fermions by attaching to them an even number of flux quanta .",
    "a field - theoretical formalism based on the jain s idea was developed by lopez and fradkin @xcite . in this approach , the statistical transformation of electrons into composite fermions is implemented by introducing a chern  simons ( cs ) gauge field interacting with electrons .    following a similar approach halperin , lee and read",
    "@xcite developed a theory for the half filled landau level ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this theory gives an explanation for many experimentally observed properties of the @xmath8 state , such as a non - zero value of the longitudinal resistivity , an anomaly in the surface acoustic wave propagation @xcite , and a dimensional resonance of the composite fermions @xcite .",
    "it predicts the formation , at half filling , of a metallic state with well defined fermi surface . from this point of view",
    ", the @xmath228 series can be considered as the usual @xmath229 shubnikov  de haas oscillations ( sdho ) for the composite fermions , providing an explanation for the prominence of the above fqhe states .",
    "details of the cs gauge field formalism can be found e.g. in @xcite and are not presented here .",
    "the statistical transformation attaches to each electron an even number @xmath230 of flux quanta of the cs gauge field . to describe the vicinity of the @xmath8 state , we take @xmath231 ; the same formalism with @xmath232 can be applied to the @xmath233 state .",
    "in the mean field approximation , the statistical magnetic field @xmath234 cancels exactly the externally applied field @xmath114 at @xmath8 . when the filling factor @xmath6 is tuned away from @xmath8 ,",
    "the effective uniform magnetic field is equal to @xmath235 . for @xmath6 close to @xmath7 , the number of filled landau levels of composite fermions @xmath236 , so that the problem can be considered quasiclassically .",
    "although a static impurity creates a scalar potential ( [ 59 ] ) only , it acquires also a vector component due to screening by fermions and mixing with the cs field . in the random phase arrroximation one gets @xmath237 where we united scalar @xmath238 and vector @xmath239 potentials in a covariant vector @xmath240 ; the vector @xmath241 represents the bare impurity potential , eq.([59 ] ) and therefore has only @xmath242 non - zero component .",
    "the tensors @xmath243 and @xmath244 represent the bare gauge field propagator and the current - density response tensor of the composite fermions , respectively .    to evaluate eq.([dais ] ) we use the coulomb gauge @xmath245 , go to the momentum space and choose the momentum @xmath246 to be directed along the @xmath247-axis : @xmath248 , @xmath249 . then @xmath240 has only 2 non - zero components corresponding to @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and both k and u become @xmath252 matrices @xcite :    @xmath253    where @xmath254 is the effective mass of fermions , @xmath255 is the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath256 is the coulomb propagator , and @xmath257 is the hall conductivity of composite fermions .    substituting ( [ tens ] ) in ( [ dais ] ) , we find @xmath258 where @xmath259 in the limit @xmath260 .",
    "depending on relations between parameters of the problem , one can find various regimes of behavior of the oscillations amplitude .",
    "we will concentrate on a regime which is the most relevant to the experiment .",
    "let us compare the first and the second term in denominator of ( [ scr ] ) .",
    "as we will see below , the typical momenta are @xmath261 , and we get for @xmath231 @xmath262 where @xmath263 , and we used typical experimental parameters @xcite @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and the experimentally estimated value for the ratio @xmath266 . for the not too large @xmath218 we are interested in , it is thus a reasonable approximation to neglect all but the first term in the denominator of ( [ scr ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath267    the random field action @xmath268 ( analogous to @xmath132 in section 3 or @xmath193 in section 4 ) is given by @xmath269 where the integration goes around a cyclotron orbit .",
    "averaging over the impurity configurations , we find @xmath270 here @xmath271 means integration along the cyclotron orbit and corresponds to the electric field contribution , whereas @xmath272 goes over the area surrounded by the orbit and describes the magnetic field contribution . taking into account that @xmath273 , we have @xmath274 .",
    "thus for relevant momenta @xmath275 and level numbers @xmath218 , @xmath276 is a reasonable approximation . in this case eq.([act ] ) reduces to @xmath277 note that electric and magnetic field fluctuations give equal contributions in this limit . according to sections 3,4 , this gives for the oscillating part of the conductivity : @xmath278 } \\label{sxxa}\\ ] ] where we introduced a parameter @xmath279 which is given according to eq.([act2 ] ) by @xmath280    let us briefly consider now effect of finite temperature @xmath281 .",
    "first of all , the sdho are then suppressed by the usual factor @xmath282 originating from the fermi distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fermions are scattered by the thermal fluctuations of the gauge field .",
    "the propagator of gauge field fluctuations is given by @xmath283 in particular for the @xmath284 component determining the magnetic field fluctuations , we get @xmath285+{v(q)\\over ( 2\\pi\\tilde{\\phi})\\sp{2}}. \\label{d11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the quasistatic approximation we find @xmath286 and consequently for the amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations @xmath287 if @xmath288 , we have @xmath289 and @xmath290",
    ". therefore , the effective magnetic susceptibility @xmath291 much exceeds its bare value @xmath292 , leading to a strong suppression of the fluctuations ( [ 79 ] ) , ( [ 80 ] ) .",
    "a similar suppression of the gauge field fluctuations in external magnetic field was found in @xcite where the magnetoconductivity of the doped mott insulators was studied .",
    "the contribution of the fluctuations ( [ 80 ] ) to the random field action @xmath293 , eq.([72 ] ) , is @xmath294 i.e. is small at @xmath295 compared to the standard term @xmath296 and decreases with @xmath218 .",
    "the slope of the dependence of @xmath297 on @xmath146 at @xmath298 is conventionally used to extract a value of the effective mass @xmath299 @xcite .",
    "this procedure is based on the assumption that @xmath300 , so that @xmath301 .",
    "the additional attenuation factor @xmath302 , eq.([81 ] ) , would then lead to a fictitious @xmath303 correction to the effective mass resulting in its apparent decrease with @xmath218 at moderately large @xmath218 .",
    "let us compare our findings with available experimental results . in fig.1",
    "we present low ",
    "temperature experimental data for the amplitude of @xmath304 from @xcite ( @xmath305 , @xmath306 ) .",
    "it is seen that they can be fitted well by @xmath307 $ ] , whereas a conventional @xmath308 fit is much worse .",
    "therefore the data apparently show the behavior @xmath309 predicted by eq.([sxxa ] ) .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath310 which is found from such a fit is @xmath311 at the same time the theoretical estimate according to eq.([tau ] ) ( with use of the parameters of @xcite ) gives @xmath312 if one uses the experimental value of the effective mass @xmath313 .",
    "a similar discrepancy is found for the low  field relaxation time : eq.([63 ] ) for @xmath314 gives @xmath315 , whereas the value quoted in @xcite is @xmath316 .",
    "we note also that the theoretically estimated values for the transport relaxation rate at @xmath8 are typically @xmath317 times greater than extracted from experimental mobilities @xcite .",
    "therefore the theory seems to overestimate relaxation rates systematically .",
    "this situation has been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "the considerable increase of relaxation times was attributed to the correlations in positions of charged impurities due to their mutual coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "we still encounter a problem , however , when trying to explain the above discrepancy in the value of @xmath310 in this way .",
    "the correlations between impurities lead to a damping of the correlator @xmath318 , eq.([61 ] ) by a certain @xmath319dependent factor .",
    "since the mechanism of suppression of sdho and the characteristic momenta are the same near @xmath320 and @xmath8 , we expect a suppression of the action @xmath132 in ( [ 62 ] ) and @xmath293 in ( [ act ] ) by roughly the same factor . for the case of low fields",
    "this factor is @xmath321 . at the same time , to reconcile the experimental data in the vicinity of @xmath8 with eq.([tau ] ) , we need this factor to be @xmath322 ^ 4\\simeq 2300 $ ] , i.e 150 times larger !",
    "it is not clear to us , what could be the source of such a drastic weakening of the random fields .",
    "more recently , experimental data @xcite on sdho near @xmath8 on a better quality sample have been published .",
    "the obtained dingle plot [ fig.3(a ) of ref.@xcite ] is again highly nonlinear and can be well fitted by our formula ( [ sxxa ] ) .",
    "the fit yields in this case the value @xmath323 , whereas the theoretical estimate according to eq.([tau ] ) using the appropriate values of @xmath206,@xmath207 and @xmath299 gives @xmath324 .",
    "the discrepancy is somewhat smaller than for the sample from @xcite but still very large .",
    "now we discuss experimental data at higher temperatures . as a result of their analysis ,",
    "an experimental value of the effective mass as a function of @xmath218 was obtained in @xcite . at moderately large @xmath218 @xmath299",
    "was found to be slowly decreasing with @xmath218 in agreement with our results . for larger @xmath218 ,",
    "a sharp increase of @xmath299 was observed in @xcite , the origin of which is not clear to us .",
    "let us note that the suggestion made in @xcite to explain the non - linearity of the dingle plot by this variation of the effective mass is not supported by our results , since @xmath299 drops out from eq.([sxxa ] ) .",
    "we have shown in this article that the path integral formalism in the quasiclassical approximation allows one to study the density of states and the conductivity of a system of charge carriers scattered by a long - range correlated random potential or a random magnetic field .",
    "we focussed attention on the oscillatory behavior of these quantities as a function of an applied magnetic field . for a random potential of correlation length @xmath135",
    ", we found the magnetooscillations in both quantities to be attenuated exponentially , the exponent being @xmath325 for @xmath204 and @xmath326 for @xmath327 , where @xmath328 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath158 the cyclotron radius in the external magnetic field . in the case of a random magnetic field of correlation length @xmath329 ,",
    "the magnetooscillations are again exponentially damped , this time with exponent @xmath326 for @xmath330 and @xmath331 for @xmath332 .",
    "our results show that the amplitude of magnetooscillations as a function of the magnetic field can be used to identify the scattering potential or random magnetic field .    finally , we considered the fqhe system near @xmath8 in the composite fermion picture . here the chern  simons field of the flux tubes attached to every fermion gives rise to static random field fluctuations at impurity sites , where fermions may be trapped . for experimentally relevant values of input parameters ,",
    "the damping of magnetooscillations is found to be proportional to @xmath333 $ ] .",
    "this is in good agreement with experimentally obtained highly non - linear dingle plots which can be very well fitted by a quartic dependence .",
    "however , the experimental value of the parameter @xmath310 is about 8 times greater than our theoretical estimate .",
    "this means that the random fields are much weaker than we expect them to be .",
    "taking into account correlations between impurities seems not to resolve this discrepancy , as we discussed in the end of the preceding section .",
    "it is not clear to us at present whether this additional weakening of random fields can be explained within the composite fermions theory or else implies a certain inconsistency of this theory .",
    "this work was initiated by the late arkady aronov , and was partially done in collaboration with him .",
