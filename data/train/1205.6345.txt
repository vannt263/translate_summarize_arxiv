    "in fact , as suggested in @xcite , sufficiently short and intense pulses from x - ray lasers may allow for the imaging of single protein molecules .",
    "this article describes a possible future upgrade of the european xfel .",
    "we present a study for a dedicated beamline for single - biomolecular imaging .",
    "the main idea is to use one of the free undulator tunnels of the european xfel for providing the user community with the three sase1 , sase2 and sase3 lines , with the addition of a fourth beamline where the combination of @xmath2 tw peak power in the energy range between @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev , and tunability of the pulse duration from @xmath3 fs to @xmath4 fs will provide significantly better conditions for single shot coherent imaging of protein molecules than at other xfel facilities .",
    "the european xfel equipped with a dedicated bio - imaging beamline represents a development half way in between a proof - of - principle and a fully dedicated bio - imaging xfel facility with high - rate of protein structure determination .",
    "the main advantage of the new beamline is the operation point at @xmath2 tw with @xmath3 fs-@xmath13 fs long pulses in the particular energy range between @xmath0 kev and @xmath13 kev , where the diffraction signal is strong .",
    "operation at @xmath2 tw in this peculiar energy range will not be accessible to other xfel facilities at least until the end of the next decade .",
    "these characteristics would enable new exciting possibilities for coherent imaging of protein molecules with size larger than @xmath4 nm .",
    "understanding the biological function of molecules such as proteins , requires the knowledge of their atomic structure .",
    "today , x - ray crystallography is a major technique to determine the atomic structure of proteins .",
    "however , there is still a serious limiting factor : in fact , many molecules fail to form crystals , which prevents x - ray protein crystallography from fully realizing its potential @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is known that about @xmath14 of biomolecules , in particular membrane proteins , do not crystallize .",
    "hence , the scattering signal is too small to be useful .",
    "increasing the number of photons in the pulse without decreasing its duration does not help , since radiation damage severely limits structural studies of single biomolecules .",

    "the elastically scattered photons are recorded by a detector array placed downstream .",

    "the advantage of using an xfel source is in the ultrashort time scale of the xfel pulse .",
    "the scattering pattern can be recorded before the molecule is destroyed .",
    "this effect is known as diffraction before destruction @xcite .",

    "the fwhm focal spot size should be about @xmath15 times larger than the sample size .",
    "for example , a spot size of @xmath16 nm is good for sample sizes smaller than @xmath4 nm . the total number of different proteins smaller than @xmath4 nm is about @xmath17 .",
    "structure determination of many of these ( about @xmath18 ) has been successfully performed @xcite .",
    "the largest number of biologically interesting structures are in the size range between @xmath4 nm and @xmath19 nm .",
    "the total number of different structures of this kind is over @xmath20 .",
    "only very few of these structures have been determined @xcite .",
    "let us estimate the minimum number of required photons per xfel pulse for successful imaging of single biomolecules .",
    "an incident photon flux of @xmath21 photons@xmath22mm@xmath23 is sufficient for obtaining a reasonably good image of a protein molecule like a lysozyme ( 14 kd ) with a size of about @xmath24 nm at photon energy of @xmath25 kev @xcite .",
    "the `` diffraction - before - destruction '' method requires a pulse duration shorter than @xmath4 fs .",
    "the number of photons per pulse required for a typical experiments is about @xmath26 .",
    "an important problem parameter is the number of scattered photons per effective pixel , which is proportional to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radiation wavelength . as a result",
    ", lower photon energies result in a stronger diffraction signal",
    ". however , a decrease in the photon energy limits the resolution .",
    "a balance may be reached in the photon energy range between @xmath0 kev and @xmath13 kev .",
    "the main application of the beamline proposed in this work is for single shot imaging of individual protein molecules .",
    "it will provide coherent x - ray radiation with properties superior to the existing and planned xfel sources .",
    "the x - ray beam will be delivered in ultrashort pulses with a duration between @xmath3 fs and @xmath4 fs , with @xmath2 tw peak power , and within a very wide photon energy range between @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev , which covers the k - edge energies from sulfur to selenium .",
    "the beamline is also designed to provide photon energies down to water window at @xmath5 kev .",
    "we believe that our developments will open exciting possibilities for structure determination of protein molecules with size larger than @xmath4 nm and in the @xmath0 kev - @xmath13 kev photon energy range of operation .",
    "for the realization of the bio - imaging beamline we propose to use the same undulator technology optimized for the generation of soft x - rays at the european xfel .",
    "the installation and commissioning of the new beamline can take place gradually . in the beginning",
    ", the new beamline would just extend the soft x - ray ( sase3 ) beamline and take advantage of the long xtd4 tunnel .",
    "an additional undulator composed by @xmath29 cells would be added into the @xmath30 m - long xtd4 tunnel .",
    "this undulator would extend the existing sase3 line , composed by @xmath31 cells , and have the same period of sase3 , in order to obtain a total cell number of @xmath7 . with this , sase3 would be de facto converted into a bio - imaging beamline . then",
    ", a new soft x - ray beamline , identical to the sase3 baseline , could be installed in the free @xmath32 m - long xtd3 tunnel .",
    "the combination of self - seeding and tapered undulator techniques would allow to meet the design output peak power of @xmath2 tw .",
    "the bio - imaging beamline would be equipped with two different self - seeding setup , one to provide monochromatization in the soft x - ray range , between @xmath5 kev and @xmath33 kev , and one to provide monochromatization in the hard x - ray range between @xmath34 kev and @xmath1 kev .",
    "a border region exists between the soft and the hard x - ray range .",
    "in fact , the x - ray optics for the self - seeding scheme adopted in one range is not suitable for the other , and vice versa .",
    "self - seeding schemes with crystal monochromators work above @xmath35 kev , where diamond crystals can be used .",
    "crystals with the right lattice parameters and with sufficiently narrow linewidth are difficult to be obtained .",
    "diffraction gratings with single metal layer coating ( au , pt ) have good first order efficiency at grazing angles up to @xmath3 kev , but at higher energies their throughput is usually too low .",
    "such gratings are conceived for the soft- x - ray self - seeding setup at the lcls . a combination of these two self - seeding setups with a tunable gap , @xmath7 cells - long undulator would allow to meet the design goal of @xmath2 tw for photon energies ranging between @xmath5 kev and @xmath33 kev , and between @xmath34 kev and @xmath1 kev .",
    "however , the users of the bio - imaging beamline mainly wish to investigate their samples in the energy range between @xmath0 kev and @xmath13 kev , where the diffraction signal is strong .",
    "finding a solution suitable for this spectral range is major challenge for self - seeding designers",
    ". a promising approach in this direction consists in using a fresh bunch technique in combination with self - seeding and tapering techniques .",
    "we will show how installation of an additional chicane behind the soft x - ray self - seeding setup enables an output peak power around @xmath2 tw for photon energy ranges between @xmath0 kev and @xmath13 kev .",
    "the combination self - seeding , fresh bunch and tapered techniques has the advantage that it does not need any significant change in the grating monochromator design proposed by the lcls crew , which is still under active investigation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the duration of the x - ray pulse is important for bio - imaging experiments . in particular , for energies smaller than @xmath13 kev , the pulse duration should be shorter than @xmath13 fs .",
    "we will show how the pulse duration can be tuned within @xmath3 fs and @xmath4 fs , still operating with nominal electron bunch distributions .",
    "the two design electron energies for the new beamline will be @xmath4 gev and @xmath36 gev , at a design charge of 0.1 nc .",
    "when the bio - imaging beamline will run at @xmath4 gev electron energy , it will be necessary to run all the fel lines at the same energy , although this may not be the preferred mode of operation for sase1 and sase2 users . however , this electron energy is still one of the nominal electron energies for the european xfel , and is compatible with the operation of sase1 and sase2 in the x - ray energy range up to @xmath25 kev .",
    "after conversion of the sase3 beamline as described in this report there will be several future upgrade options for a dedicated bio - imaging beamline . to avoid interference with other beamlines , the photon energy range of the self - seeding setup with grating monochromator",
    "can be extended up to @xmath13 kev , and the minimal design electron energy can be increased up to @xmath37 gev .",
    "a promising approach in this direction consists in using diffraction gratings with very shallow groove depths , capable of working at very small angles of incidence .",
    "recently , a holographic laminar grating has been realized and characterized in the energy range between @xmath0 kev and @xmath13 kev at the incidence angle of @xmath38 degree , showing up to @xmath39 efficiency @xcite .",
    "self - seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow the sase bandwidth and to produce nearly transform - limited x - ray pulses @xcite-@xcite . in its simplest configuration the self - seeding setup in the hard x - ray regime",
    "consists of two undulators separated by photon monochromator and an electron bypass beamline , typically a 4-dipole chicane .",
    "the two undulators are resonant at the same radiation wavelength . the sase radiation generated by the first undulator passes through the narrow - band monochromator , thus generating a transform - limited pulse , which is then used as a coherent seed in the second undulator .",
    "chromatic dispersion effects in the bypass chicane smear out the microbunching in the electron bunch produced by the sase lasing in the first undulator . electrons and",
    "monochromatized photon beam are recombined at the entrance of the second undulator , and the radiation is amplified by the electron bunch in the second undulator , until saturation is reached .",
    "the required seed power at the beginning of the second undulator must dominate over the shot noise power within the gain bandpass , which is order of a few kw .    despite the unprecedented increase in peak power of the x - ray pulses for sase x - ray fels ( see e.g. @xcite ) , some applications , including single biomolecule imaging , require still higher photon flux . the most promising way to extract more fel power than that at saturation",
    "is by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator @xcite-@xcite .",
    "also , a significant increase in power is achievable by starting the fel process from a monochromatic seed rather than from noise @xcite-@xcite . tapering consists in a slow reduction of the field strength of the undulator in order to preserve the resonance wavelength , while the kinetic energy of the electrons decreases due to the fel process .",
    "the undulator taper could be simply implemented as a step from one undulator segment to the next .",
    "the magnetic field tapering is provided by changing the undulator gap .",
    "the proposed setup is not simple as discussed above and is composed of four undulators separated by three magnetic chicanes as shown in fig .",
    "[ biof3 ] .",
    "these undulators consist of @xmath40 , @xmath0 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 undulator cells , respectively .",
    "each magnetic chicane is compact enough to fit one undulator segment .",
    "the installation of chicanes does not perturb the undulator focusing system . the implementation of the self - seeding scheme for soft x - ray and hard x - ray would exploit the first and the third magnetic chicane , respectively . both self - seeding setups should be compact enough to fit one undulator module .    for soft x - ray self - seeding ,",
    "the monochromator usually consists of a grating @xcite .",
    "recently , a very compact soft x - ray self - seeding scheme has appeared , based on a grating monochromator @xcite .",
    "the proposed monochromator is composed of only three mirrors and a rotational vls grating .",
    "it is equipped with an exit slit only .",
    "a preliminary design of the grating monochromator adopts a constant focal - point mode in order to fix the slit location .",
    "the delay of the photons is about @xmath42 ps .",
    "the monochromator is continuously tunable in the photon energy range between @xmath5 kev and @xmath33 kev .",
    "the resolution is about @xmath43 .",
    "the transmission of the monochromator beamline is close to @xmath39 .",
    "the magnetic chicane delays the electron electron bunch accordingly , so that the photon beam passing through the monochromator system recombines with the same electron bunch .",
    "the chicane provides a dispersion strength of about @xmath3 mm in order to match the optical delay and also smears out the sase microbunching generated in the first @xmath40 cells of the undulator .",
    "the final design is under active investigations , and is subject to many changes @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we studied the performance of the above - described scheme for the european xfel upgrade . for bio - imaging beamline",

    "a monochromator usually consists of crystals in the bragg geometry .",
    "a conventional 4-crystal , fixed exit monochromator introduces optical delay of , at least , a few millimeters , which has to be compensated with the introduction of an electron bypass longer than one undulator module . to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "a simpler self - seeding scheme was proposed in @xcite , which uses the transmitted x - ray beam from the single crystal to seed the same electron bunch , fig .",

    "we propose to use a diamond crystal with a thickness of @xmath8 mm . for a symmetric c(400 ) bragg reflection , it will be possible to cover the photon energy range from @xmath34 kev to @xmath1 kev .",
    "one of the main technical problems to provide bio - imaging capabilities in @xmath0 kev - @xmath13 kev photon energy range is the extension of the self - seeding grating monochromator design from @xmath3 kev up to @xmath13 kev .",

    "our solution is based in essence on the fresh bunch technique @xcite and exploits the above described conservative design of self - seeding setup based on a grating monochromator .",
    "the hardware requirement is minimal , and in order to implement a fresh bunch technique it is sufficient to install an additional magnetic chicane at a special position behind the soft x - ray self - seeding setup .",
    "the function of this second chicane is both to smear out the electron bunch microbunching , and to delay the electron bunch with respect to the monochromatic soft x - ray pulse produced in the second undulator . in this way",
    ", only half of the electron bunch is seeded , and saturates in the third undulator .",
    "finally , the second half of the electron bunch , which remains unspoiled , is seeded by the third harmonic of the monochromatic radiation pulse generated in the third undulator , which is also monochromatic .",
    "the final delay of the electron bunch with respect to the seed radiation pulse can be obtained with a third , hard x - ray self - seeding magnetic chicane , which in this mode of operation is simply used to provide magnetic delay .",
    "the monochromatic third harmonic radiation pulse used as seed for the unperturbed part of the electron bunch is in the gw power level , and the combination of self - seeding and fresh bunch technique is extremely insensitive to non - ideal effects .",
    "the final undulator , composed by @xmath41 cells , is tuned to the third harmonic frequency , and is simply used to amplify the x - ray pulse up to @xmath2 tw output power level .",
    "it should be noted that the delay of the radiation pulse with respect to the electron bunch in the second and in the third chicane has a different sign .",
    "the solution to this problem is to install a mirror chicane within the second magnetic chicane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ biof2 ] .",
    "the function of the mirror chicane is to delay the radiation in the range between @xmath2 kev and @xmath33 kev relatively to the electron bunch .",
    "the glancing angle of the mirrors is as small as @xmath0 mrad . at the undulator location ,",
    "the transverse size of the photon beam is smaller than @xmath8 mm , meaning that the mirror length would be just about @xmath13 cm .",
    "the single - shot mode of operation will relax the heat - loading issues .",
    "the mirror chicane can be built in such a way to obtain a delay of the radiation pulse of about @xmath44 m .",
    "this is enough to compensate a bunch delay of about @xmath45 m from the magnetic chicane , and to provide any desired shift in the range between @xmath46 m and @xmath47 m .",
    "note that for the european xfel parameters , @xmath2 nm microbunching is washed out with a weak dispersive strength corresponding to an @xmath48 in the order of ten microns .",
    "the dispersive strength of the proposed magnetic chicane is more than sufficient to this purpose .",
