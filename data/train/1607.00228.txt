    "accretion can proceed under different scenarios . in principle , when falling matter has non - zero initial angular momentum , then the accretion disk may form down to the innermost marginally stable orbit ( isco ) .",

    "accretion disks in lmxb are hot in their central part , having the gas temperature of the order of @xmath1 k. for the purpose of this paper , relativistic corrections and radial advection were neglected , since we model basic disk emission . if the compact object in lmxb is a neutron star , then we should expect that the neutron star is hot , with @xmath2 up to a few @xmath3 k. such system is bright in x - ray domain , and the derivation of the total shape of its intensity spectrum is the principal aim of this paper .",

    "the secondary is not visible in x - rays and that star is only important to estimate the size of the roche lobe , and therefore , the outer disk radius . since the emitting source such as lmxb is not spherically symmetric then we have to reject standard formula that the observed luminosity is just proportional to the flux ( in ergs per second per one @xmath4 ) emitted from the unit surface of a spherical star @xcite . in case of the disk - like system we have to compute the observed intensity starting from the basic formula i.e. eq .  [ 1 - 27 ] . in @xcite . in this paper we derived such formula appropriate to the lmxb with neutron star , but",
    "the same calculation can be done for any non - spherical system .",
    "we calculated the observed intensity assuming that both the neutron star and the accretion disk radiate as black bodies .",

    "2 .   energy dependent flux of radiation in plane parallel geometry : @xmath7 is the average of the specific intensity @xmath5 weighted by cos@xmath8 ( zenithal angle ) , and represents the energy flux flowing through one @xmath4 on the surface of the emitter .",

    "this flux represents intrinsic property of the source of radiation .",
    "3 .   at the same time",
    ", infinitesimal energy @xmath10 can be measured by a distant observer , because specific intensity does not change in the empty space along the ray path . that energy is defined as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a solid angle in steradian [ sr ] .",
    "this formula is applicable for the flat space , and we assume it in this paper . in case",
    "when the emitter is located close to the black hole , both general and special relativistic corrections should be taken into account as shown by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . a4 ) .",
    "+ integrating eq .",
    "[ row:1 ] over the solid angle subtended by the source , we obtain energy dependent intensity : @xmath13 per unit time measured by one @xmath4 of the detector .",
    "this quantity has the same unit as energy dependent flux and diminishes with the increasing distance to the observer .",
    "but it is not an intrinsic property of the source , and we show below how it depends on the source geometry .          assuming that the emitter is spherically symmetric neutron star surface , we can define its observed monochromatic intensity following standard formula derived by @xcite ( eq .  1 - 27 ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes specific intensity and @xmath16 is the solid angle subtended by the area as seen by an observer .",
    "the integration undergoes over solid angle which is small enough to substitute @xmath17 , where ds is the surface of the star defined as an annulus @xmath18 normal to the line of sight , and @xmath19 is the distance to the observer . for spherically symmetric neutron star with the radius @xmath20",
    "we get : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angle between direction of the light beam and the normal to the surface .",
    "since @xmath23 , the solid angle becomes @xmath24 , and finally we obtain : @xmath25 we note here , that the observed intensity per detector area is proportional to the flux emitted from 1  @xmath4 of the star s surface , only due to the spherical shape of the emitting region .    in case of axisymmetric standard geometrically thin accretion disk ( for example :",
    "* hereafter ss73 ) , the same procedure gives : @xmath26 where the monochromatic intensity , @xmath15 emitted in the specific direction is integrated over the whole disk surface from the inner to outer disk radii .",

    "we have checked that for the typical mass of the secondary less than the solar mass , there is enough space for the disk of a radius up to 1000 @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "the lowest value of this angle corresponds almost to the `` edge on '' disk , while the highest value to `` face on '' disk .",
    "we use the lowest value of @xmath58 , since for smaller viewing angles the disk geometrical thickness is large enough to cover neutron star completely .",
    "furthermore , in ss73 model , the disk height increases with radius , and for the disk seen `` edge on '' , we observe only the disk rim .",
    "we are aware of this problem , but to show the basic mutual attenuation effect we neglect the disk height .",

    "presented spectra are broad , and the double bump structure in the observed intensity spectrum is clearly visible for some set of parameters .",

    "this means that optical signal is not associated with the emission from an outer disk .",

    ", the neutron star atmosphere is 3.5 times hotter , but the warm absorption column is by 0.2 smaller , than the same values reported by @xcite .",

    "in this paper we theoretically explained the appearance of non - spherical emission by proper computation of the amount of energy which goes directly towards observer .",
    "we defined full set of terms for observed intensity of a non - spherical system , consisting of a neutron star and the accretion disk .",
    "we took into account attenuation effects as seen by a distant observer at various aspect angles .",
    "we demonstrated that the overall continuum shape shows two peaks .",
    "the lower energy peak is caused by the accretion disk emission , whereas higher energy bump is due to the neutron star .",
    "the position of the transition between peaks and their relative normalization is self consistently computed by our formulae .",
    "contrary to the spherically symmetric emission the neutron star contribution in our model depends on the aspect angle , due to attenuation effect .    in this paper we showed ,",
    "that if the observed intensity of a source was correctly computed , even without relativistic correction and without light from the boundary layer , then we obtain the double bump source spectrum due to the double non - spherically symmetric , emitting region .",
    "such double bump spectrum , or the broadness of the spectral disk component , are very often observed in x - ray band of accreting objects .",
    "we attempted to fit the x - ray spectrum of lmxb xte  j1709 - 267 , downloaded from _ xmm - newton _ archive .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral data are too narrow co cover and fit our model , because we have no points below 0.5 kev .",
    "the additional points in optical and uv domains are necessary to discriminate our model parameters .",
    "unfortunately , the double bump structure predicted by our model of lmxb with an accretion disk is difficult to observe since it falls into a photon energy range less then 0.5 kev .",
    "if the non - spherical emitting system contains hot compact corona @xcite instead of the neutron star , the double peak structure should be visible in x - ray domain .",
    "we argue that for some parameters the total spectrum from both components can explain soft x - ray excess in those objects .",
