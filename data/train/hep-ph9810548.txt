    "however , recent data on inclusive high @xmath2 jets from fermilab @xcite and high @xmath3 events at hera @xcite remind us that there are still large uncertainties in the parton distributions at large @xmath1 .",
    "the precise knowledge of parton distributions at large @xmath1 is very important in search for signals of new physics at very high energies , which might be reached only by the partons with large momentum fraction @xmath1 at the colliders .    according to the qcd perturbation theory ,",
    "parton distributions at large @xmath1 and high @xmath3 can be derived from the parton distributions at large @xmath1 and lower @xmath3 by solving the dglap evolution equations .",
    "however , data from most physical observables are only sensitive to the parton distributions in the intermediate or small @xmath1 region , because of the phase space integration and the fact that the parton distributions decrease very fast as @xmath1 increases .",
    "it is believed that structure functions measured in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) at large bjorken @xmath0 and low @xmath3 might be the best source to get the direct information on the parton distributions at large @xmath1 .",
    "but , at large @xmath0 and low @xmath3 , the structure functions receive significant power corrections @xcite , and these power corrections confuse the determination of the parton distributions .",
    "in general , there are two types of power corrections , known as the kinematic and the dynamical power corrections .",
    "the kinematic power corrections is due to the fact that the nucleon has a finite mass , @xmath4 .",
    "such power corrections have been systematically discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical power corrections are the results of the interactions between quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the dynamical power corrections are in general proportional to the multiparton correlation functions or the matrix elements of high twist operators , which are different from the normal parton distributions .",
    "because of the large number of unknown multiparton correlation functions , the actual size of the dynamical power corrections to the structure functions have not been well understood theoretically . in this paper , we derive analytically the leading dynamical power corrections to the structure functions , and provide the numerical estimates of the power corrections .",
