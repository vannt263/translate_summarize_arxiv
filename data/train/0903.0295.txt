    "lutz twists have been a fundamental tool in studying contact structures in dimension 3 .",
    "they have been used to construct contact structures on all closed oriented 3-manifolds and to manipulate the homotopy class of plane field of a given contact structure . in particular ,",
    "lutz @xcite used this construction to give the first proof that all homotopy classes of plane fields can be realized by contact structures .",
    "we recall that a lutz twist alters a contact structure on a solid torus neighborhood of a transverse curve by introducing an @xmath1-family of overtwisted disks ( see below for a precise definition ) .",
    "an overtwisted disk in a contact 3-manifold @xmath2 is an embedded disk in @xmath3 that is tangent to @xmath4 only along its boundary and at one interior point .",
    "a contact manifold is called overtwisted if it contains an overtwisted disk and otherwise it is called tight . starting with eliashberg s fundamental paper @xcite defining the tight versus overtwisted dichotomy , these notions have taken a central role in 3 dimensional contact geometry .",
    "overtwisted contact structures are completely classified @xcite and exhibit a great deal of flexibility , appearing to be fairly topological in nature . much of the insight into such structures has come from careful analysis of the lutz twist construction and natural questions that arose from it .",
    "there is not a great deal known about contact structures in dimensions above 3 . specifically , there are few constructions of contact structures and few tools to manipulate a given contact structure .",
    "we introduce one such tool by giving a possible generalization of a lutz twist to all odd dimensions . as a consequence we reprove and",
    "slightly strengthen a result proved by niederkrger and van koert in @xcite that every @xmath5dimensional manifold that has a contact structure can be given a non - fillable contact structure .",
    "the proof in fact produces an embedded overtwisted family ( that is a plastikstufe in the language of @xcite ) by changing the given contact structure in a small neighborhood of any @xmath6dimensional isotropic submanifold @xmath7 ( with trivial conformal symplectic normal bundle ) .",
    "the overtwisted family is modeled on @xmath7 ( that is @xmath7 is the elliptic singular locus of the family , see subsection  [ sec : families ] below ) .",
    "this construction is analogous to creating an overtwisted disk in dimension three by performing a lutz twist along a knot in the neighborhood of a point ( an overtwisted disk is a 3dimensional overtwisted family ) .",
    "overtwisted families , in dimensions above three , were first considered in @xcite as an obstruction to symplectic fillability of a contact structure , though precursors of them go back to gromov s work @xcite . in @xcite presas",
    "gave the first examples of overtwisted families in a closed contact manifold of dimension greater than three .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath2 be a contact manifold of dimension @xmath8 and let @xmath7 be an @xmath6dimensional isotropic submanifold with trivial conformal symplectic normal bundle .",
    "then we may alter @xmath4 in any neighborhood of @xmath7 to a contact structure @xmath9 that contains an overtwisted family modeled on @xmath10 moreover , we may assume that @xmath9 is homotopic to @xmath4 through almost contact structures .",
    "a corollary is the following result originally proven , modulo the statement about the homotopy class of almost contact structures and core of the overtwisted family , via a delicate surgery construction in @xcite based on subtle constructions in @xcite .",
    "we call a contact structure if it contains an overtwisted family .",
    "( we use the adjective `` weakly '' since it is not clear that this is the most appropriate generalization of overtwisted to dimensions above 3 , though it does share some properties with 3 dimensional overtwisted contact manifolds . )",
    "[ maincor ] every odd dimensional manifold that supports a contact structure also supports a weakly overtwisted , and hence non ( semi - positive ) symplectically fillable , contact structure in the same homotopy class of almost contact structure .",
    "moreover , we can assume the overtwisted family is modeled on any @xmath6dimensional isotropic submanifold with trivial conformal symplectic normal bundle .",
    "we also observe the following non uniqueness result which can also be found in @xcite .",
    "[ nonunique ] there are at least three distinct contact structures on @xmath11 .",
    "we remark that our proof relies on cut - and - paste techniques and branch cover techniques that seem to be new to the literature .",
    "these techniques should be useful in constructing contact structures on higher dimensional manifolds and will be more fully explored and systematized in a future paper .",

    "the situation is more difficult .",

    "as discussed in subsection  [ sec : almost ] an obstruction to two almost contact structures being homotopic is the chern classes of the almost contact structure . in dimension 3",
    "it is well known that lutz twisting affects the first chern class of the contact structure . in higher dimensions",
    "this is not the case .    in the proof of theorem  [ main ] above we showed that the homotopy class of almost contact structure is unchanged by a lutz twist , but one might ask if the homotopy class can be affected with a generalized half lutz twist ( should it ever be defined ) .    [ chern ] let @xmath2 be a closed contact @xmath5-manifold for @xmath596 suppose @xmath597 is an embedded isotropically parameterized family of transverse curves in @xmath2 with @xmath7 of dimension @xmath255 if @xmath9 is obtained from @xmath4 by altering the contact structure in a neighborhood of @xmath253 then the chern classes of @xmath598 and @xmath599 are equal for @xmath600      one can easily construct a handle decomposition of @xmath3 in which a neighborhood of @xmath253 can be taken to be a union of handles of index larger than or equal to @xmath601 moreover the contact structures @xmath4 and @xmath9 are the same outside a neighborhood of @xmath602 that is away from the handles that make up the neighborhood .",
    "as @xmath603 is the primary obstruction to the existence of a @xmath604-frame over the @xmath605 skeleton of @xmath3 we see that @xmath603 of @xmath4 and @xmath9 must be the same for @xmath606    in dimension 3 one can use lutz twists to produce contact structures in any homotopy class of almost contact structure .",
    "one might hope to do this in higher dimensions as well , but clearly proposition  [ chern ] shows our notion of lutz twist ( even a more general one than defined here ) can not achieve this .",
    "so we ask the following question .",
    "is there some notion of lutz twisting , or some other modification of a contact structure , that will guarantee that any manifold @xmath3 admitting a contact structure admits one in every homotopy class of almost contact structure ?      in @xcite the weakly overtwisted contact structures came from weakly overtwisted contact structures of lower dimension .",
    "more precisely , the core of the overtwisted families constructed in dimension @xmath8 were constructed as a product of @xmath1 and an overtwisted family in dimension @xmath607 starting in dimension 3 where the core is just a point , one sees that all the cores of overtwisted families constructed in @xcite are tori of the appropriate dimension .",
    "the weakly overtwisted contact structures constructed in @xcite were constructed by taking the previous examples and performing surgery on the ambient manifold without affecting the overtwisted family .",
    "thus , once again , we see that all the overtwisted families are modeled on tori . from our construction",
    "we can show the following result .",
    "[ anycore ] let @xmath2 be a contact manifold of dimension @xmath8 .",
    "given any @xmath6dimensional isotropic submanifold @xmath7 in @xmath2 with trivial conformal symplectic normal bundle there is a contact structure @xmath9 on @xmath3 that contains an overtwisted family modeled on @xmath10 moreover , if @xmath7 is any abstract @xmath6dimensional manifold ( that is not necessarily already embedded in @xmath3 ) with trivial complexified tangent bundle , then there is a contact structure on @xmath3 with overtwisted family modeled on @xmath10    the first statement is clear as we can find an embedded isotropically parameterized family of transverse curves @xmath253 as in section  [ sec : getfamily ] and then use theorem  [ thm : genlutz ] to perform a lutz twist to produce a contact structure @xmath9 with an overtwisted family modeled on @xmath10    for the second statement we need to see that given a @xmath7 with the required properties we can embed it in @xmath2 as an isotropic submanifold with trivial conformal symplectic normal bundle .",
    "it is clear , due to the dimensions involved , that @xmath7 can be embedded in a ball in @xmath473 it is well known that isotropic submanifolds of dimension less than @xmath44 satisfy an h - principle @xcite .",
    "this @xmath608-principle states that if an embedding @xmath609 is covered by a bundle map @xmath610 to @xmath4 sending the tangent planes of @xmath7 to isotropic spaces in @xmath4 then the embedding can be isotoped to an isotropic embedding .",
    "thus we need to construct a bundle map @xmath610 to @xmath611 sending @xmath612 to an isotropic subspace of @xmath613 in the end we will also want the conformal symplectic normal bundle to be trivial .",
    "this implies that we need to see a bundle isomorphism from @xmath614 to @xmath615 since @xmath200 can be taken to have its image in a darboux ball of @xmath3 we can assume that @xmath611 is the trivial bundle @xmath616 now it is clear that if @xmath617 is trivial then we have such an isomorphism .    from this theorem",
    "we see that it is easy to produce overtwisted families modeled on many manifolds .",
    "in particular , any oriented 2manifold , respectively 3manifold , can be realized as the core of an overtwisted family in a contact 7 , respectively 9 , manifold .",
    "moreover , the vanishing of the first pontryagin class of the tangent bundle of a 4manifold is sufficient to guarantee it can be made the core of an overtwisted family in a contact 11manifold .",
    "it would be very interesting to know the answer to the following question .",
    "if @xmath618 contains an overtwisted family modeled on @xmath7 does it also contain an overtwisted family modeled on any , or even some , other @xmath6manifold @xmath470 ( satisfying suitable tangential conditions ) ?    in dimension 3 ,",
    "overtwisted contact structures are very flexible and various questions about them usually have a topological flavor .",
    "that is , if something is true topologically then it is frequently true for overtwisted contact structures . for example ,",
    "if two overtwisted contact structures are homotopic as plane fields in dimension 3 then they are isotopic , @xcite .",
    "we also know that any overtwisted contact structure is supported by a planar open book ( just like any 3manifold ) , @xcite .",
    "thus if overtwisted families are the `` right '' generalization of overtwisted disks to higher dimensional manifolds then we would expect to have similar results .",
    "an affirmative answer to the question above would essentially say you have a lot of flexibility in the cores of overtwisted families .",
