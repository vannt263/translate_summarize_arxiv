    "molecular dynamics ( md ) methods are a useful technique to study the properties of liquid systems , and the last two decades have witnessed a large increase in the application of _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics methods ( aimd ) based on the density functional theory @xcite ( dft ) for the treatment of the electron system .",
    "this theory allows calculation of the ground state electronic energy of a collection of atoms , for given nuclear positions , and also yields the forces on the nuclei via the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "it allows md simulations in which the nuclear positions evolve according to classical mechanics with the electronic subsystem following adiabatically .",
    "most aimd methods are based on the kohn - sham ( ks ) orbital representation of the dft ( ks - aimd methods ) which , at present , poses heavy computational demands which limit the size of the systems that can be studied as well as the simulation times .",
    "however , some of these constraints are eased in the so - called orbital - free _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics ( of - aimd ) method , which by disposing of the electronic orbitals of the ks formulation provides a simulation method where the number of variables describing the electronic state is greatly reduced , enabling the study of larger samples ( several hundreds of particles ) and for longer simulation times ( tens of ps ) .",
    "this paper reports the results of an _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics simulation on the static and dynamic properties of liquid silicon ( l - si ) at thermodynamic conditions near its triple point .",
    "si is an interesting material with many peculiar properties which , along with its technological importance , has stimulated intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work .",
    "its high - density forms include the crystalline , amorphous and liquid phases with the former two being covalently bonded and semiconducting and the latter one metallic . at melting si undergoes a semiconductor - metal transition along with a density increase of @xmath0 10% and significant changes in the local atomic structure .",
    "this evolves from an open one , with a tetrahedral fourfold coordination , to a more compact liquid structure with a white - tin - type arrangement preserving the local tetrahedrality and with an approximate sixfold coordination .",
    "@xcite    most theoretical studies on l - si have focused on its static structural properties and have resorted to classical md simulations in which the liquid system was characterized by effective interatomic potentials constructed either empirically by fitting to experimental data @xcite , or derived from some approximate theoretical model . @xcite .",
    "more recently , some ks - aimd calculations @xcite have been reported , although the results dealt with electronic and static properties only because of the computational constraints inherent in this method .",
    "stich _ et al _",
    "@xcite performed the first ks - aimd calculation for l - si near the triple point using 64 particles , a non - local bachelet - hamann - schluter type pseudopotential @xcite and the local density approximation ( lda ) for the electronic exchange and correlation energies .",
    "subsequently , a more comprehensive study was performed @xcite with a larger number of atoms ( 350 particles ) and a spin dependent generalized gradient approximation for electron exchange and correlation .",

    "et al _ @xcite using 64 atoms and a non - local , troullier - martins type , pseudopotential @xcite these _ ab - initio _ studies have provided accurate descriptions of the local liquid structure and valuable insights into the the valence electron charge densities , but , by necessity , they were too short to address dynamical properties ( besides the self - diffusion coefficient ) and these properties will now be the main focus of the present report which , to our knowledge , is the first _ ab - initio _",

    "although all experimental @xmath1 s show a distinctive shoulder at the high-@xmath2 side of the main peak , there are some discrepancies in the positions and heights of the first peak , its shoulder and the second peak .",
    "experimental investigations of the dynamic structure of l - si have been hampered by the large adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath3 m / s ) , which prevents the use of the inelastic thermal neutron scattering ( ins ) technique for investigating the collective excitations for small @xmath2-values .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical structure of l - si near the triple point has been investigated recently by hosokawa _",
    "et al _ @xcite using high - resolution inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) which has no such kinematic restrictions . the measurements by hosokawa _",

    "another key ingredient of the energy functional is the the local ionic pseudopotential , @xmath31 , describing the ion - electron interaction .",

    "is performed every ionic time step by using a quenching method which results in the ground state electronic density and energy .",

    "this shape has strong similarities with the md simulation results for liquid water at room conditions @xcite , although the @xmath120 of l - si always remains positive whereas in liquid water it takes negative values after the bump .",

    "in contrast , the simple liquid metals show a very different pattern with both @xmath144 and @xmath145 oscillating about zero .",
    "the @xmath120 also shows oscillations which , beyond the first minimum , are primarily determined by the @xmath144 which also dominates the large @xmath34 behaviour of @xmath120 .    the longitudinal and transverse components of the power spectrum are shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath120 for simple liquids , gaskell and miller , suggested that the appearance of a peak in @xmath122 at a frequency well below @xmath151 was indirect evidence that the liquid system can sustain the propagation of shear waves .",
    "the present results which show that l - si lacks both the frequency peak and shear waves , are consistent with their suggestion .",
    "finally , we note that the diffusion coefficient , which is proportional to @xmath152 , is completely determined by the transverse component which contributes @xmath0 99 % of the total .",
    "the time ft of @xmath117 gives its frequency spectrum , @xmath153 , known as the self - dynamic structure factor , which has experimental importance due to its connection with the incoherent part of the ins cross - section .",
    "the @xmath153 exhibits , for all @xmath2-values , a monotonic decay with frequency from a peak value at @xmath154 .",
    "usually , @xmath153 is characterized by the peak value , @xmath155 , and the hwhm , @xmath156 , which are frequently reported normalized with respect to the values of the hydrodynamic ( @xmath2 @xmath73 0 ) limit , by introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",

    "indeed , it has been found @xcite that liquid simple metals near their triple point have an oscillating @xmath159 , stemming from the `` cage effect '' , whereas for a dense gas it decreases monotonically from unity at @xmath2=0 to a @xmath161 behaviour at large @xmath2 .",
    "the results for l - si for both @xmath159 and @xmath160 are more similar to those for a dense gas , which must be a consequence of the open structure .",
    "an indirect check on the reliability of these results may be provided by the mc theory @xcite which , has already shown its capability to account for the experimental @xmath159 and @xmath160 in liquid simple metals @xcite at @xmath2 @xmath72 @xmath7 . according to the mc theory    @xmath162    for small @xmath2-values , where @xmath163 , @xmath164 and the functions @xmath165 and @xmath166 are given in ref . .",
    "in both equations the first term is the hydrodynamic result and the second one accounts for the coupling of mass diffusion with the collective modes .",

    "( [ modecp ] ) and the results are also shown in fig .",
    "[ delsig ] . for @xmath2 @xmath72",
    "@xmath7 the of - aimd and mc theory results are in good agreement , similar to that found for simple metals .",
    "this agreement points to the ability of the mc theory to describe the single particle dynamics , and presumably the collective dynamics too , in l - si .",
    "several static and dynamic properties of l - si at a thermodynamic state close to the triple point have been evaluated .",
    "the simulations have been performed using the orbital free _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics method combined with a first - principles local pseudopotential constructed within the same framework .",
    "the results obtained for the static structure are comparable to those obtained by earlier ks - aimd calculations @xcite , and are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "we also stress the good description provided by the of - aimd method for the orientational correlations , as described by the bond - angle distribution function , @xmath56 .",
    "the obtained structural magnitudes are in vein with other previous _ ab - initio _ studies which suggested for l - si a local structure consisting in a mixture of both tetrahedrally bonded atoms and a higher coordinated structure ( probably a distorted metallic white - tin structure ) .",
    "this latter assertion is based on the idea @xcite that for non - close packed systems , the structure of the molten state resembles that of the high pressure solid state .",
    "if we now recall that in crystalline si the semiconducting diamond structure contracts with pressure and transforms at 12 gpa to the metallic white - tin structure , this latter one looks as the most likely to be appear in l - si .",
    "although the _ ab - initio _ methods based on the kohn - sham approach provide a deeper insight into those physical magnitudes related to bonding and electronic properties @xcite , their heavy computational demands have precluded their application to the study of the dynamic properties of liquids .",
    "indeed , the calculation of the dynamical properties in l - si has been the main aim of the present calculations which , incidentally were spurred by recent ixs data @xcite .",
    "moreover , we stress that this is the first _ ab - initio _",
    "study on the dynamical properties of l - si .",
    "the intermediate scattering functions , @xmath69 , have at low-@xmath2 values , a strong diffusive component which is comparable to what has been found in liquid ge , but is at variance with the liquid simple metals where the diffusive component is much weaker .",
    "the dynamic structure factors , @xmath75 , show collective density excitations over a similar range of wavelenths as those in liquid simple metals .",
    "moreover , the dispersion relation of the excitations closely follows the existing experimental data @xcite .",
    "the transverse current correlation functions , @xmath107 , show extremely weak oscillations around zero and take positive values for most of the time .",
    "this shape leads to spectra , @xmath108 , with no inelastic peaks which in turn reflect the absence of shear waves .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the analysis of the spectra of the vacf and appears as an effect of the low coordination number with its attendant negligible `` cage effect '' .",
    "this is also reflected in the single particle dynamics , as embodied in the vacf and the self - intermediate scattering functions , leading to a behaviour different from that typical of the liquid simple metals near melting .",
    "nevertheless , the mc theory appears capable of accounting for the single - particle dynamics in l - si .",
    "calculated self - diffusion and shear viscosity transport coefficients were in fair agreement with experiment and/or other _ ab - initio _ calculations .    up to now",
    ", the of - aimd method has shown its ability to provide an accurate description of the bulk static and dynamic properties in simple liquid systems @xcite .",
    "however , the present results for the static and dynamic properties of l - si illustrate the potential of the of - aimd method for treating liquid systems with remnants of covalent bonding and therefore open new venues concerning its range of applicability .",
