    "in fact it is sufficient that the operad @xmath13 fulfills certain coherence conditions . then the free @xmath13-algebra generated by a set @xmath14 of variables is always a @xmath15-hopf algebra with the diagonal @xmath16 ( also called co - addition ) as a comultiplication .",
    "there canonically exists an operad @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . a table of pairs @xmath19 ( triples in fact , if coassociativity of the comultiplication is replaced by a different law )",

    "we describe the free unitary @xmath7-algebra @xmath34 together with @xmath16 in more detail .",
    "we also explicitly describe the graded dual @xmath35 , which is equipped with a shuffle multiplication that is a sum of the shuffles . for @xmath11-hopf algebras",
    "one may pass to the appropriate subalgebras and quotients .",
    "an analogon of the poincar - birkhoff - witt theorem for the operads @xmath11 is proved in section 5 , see theorems  [ thmpbw ] and  [ thmpbwdual ] .",

    "moreover , we note that there are cocommutative @xmath0-hopf algebras ( with the same coalgebra structure ) associated to the given @xmath11-hopf algebras . in section 6 , we discuss the generating series and characteristic functions for the operads of primitives . here",
