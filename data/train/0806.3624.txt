    "the electroweak ( ew ) production of a standard model higgs boson in association with two hard jets in the forward and backward regions of the detector  frequently quoted as `` vector - boson fusion '' ( vbf)is a cornerstone in the higgs - boson search both in the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc and also plays an important role in the determination of higgs - boson couplings at this collider .",
    "higgs+2jets production in pp collisions proceeds through two different channels .",
    "the first channel corresponds to a pure ew process .",
    "it comprises the scattering of two ( anti-)quarks mediated by @xmath3- and @xmath4-channel w- or z - boson exchange , with the higgs boson radiated off the virtual weak boson .",
    "it also involves higgs - boson radiation off a w- or z - boson produced in @xmath5-channel quark  antiquark annihilation ( higgs - strahlung process ) , with the weak boson decaying hadronically .",
    "the second channel proceeds through strong interactions , the higgs boson being radiated off a heavy - quark loop that couples to any -1 parton of the incoming hadrons via gluons  @xcite .    in the weak - boson - mediated processes , the two scattered quarks are usually visible as two hard forward jets , in contrast to other jet production mechanisms , offering a good background suppression ( transverse - momentum and rapidity cuts on jets , jet rapidity gap , central - jet veto , etc . ) . applying appropriate event selection criteria ( see e.g.   and references in )",
    "it is possible to sufficiently suppress background and to enhance the vbf channel over the hadronic higgs+2jets production mechanism .    in order to match the required precision for theoretical predictions at the lhc , qcd and ew",
    "corrections are needed .",
    "when vbf cuts are imposed , the cross section can be approximated by the contribution of squared @xmath3- and @xmath4-channel diagrams only , which reduces the qcd corrections to vertex corrections to the weak - boson  quark coupling .",
    "explicit next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations in this approximation exist since more than a decade @xcite , while corrections to distributions have been calculated in the last few years @xcite .",
    "recently , the full nlo ew and qcd corrections to this process have become available @xcite .",
    "this calculation includes , for the first time , the complete set of ew and qcd diagrams , namely the @xmath3- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-channel contributions , as well as all interferences at nlo .",
    "higher - order loop - induced interference effects between vbf and gluon  gluon fusion have been examined in and turn out to be completely negligible .",
    "very recently , also the additional supersymmetric qcd and ew corrections within the mssm have been evaluated  @xcite and found to be typically below or at the 1% level .    in these proceedings",
    "we briefly summarize the calculation of the nlo ew and qcd corrections presented in and give new results on distributions for a higgs - boson mass of @xmath0 .",
    "we have calculated the complete qcd and ew nlo corrections to higgs - boson -1 production via weak vbf at the lhc . at lo",
    ", this process receives contributions from the partonic processes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "all lo and one - loop nlo diagrams are related by crossing symmetry to the corresponding decay amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "the qcd and ew nlo corrections to these decays were discussed in . in our calculation of the corrections , which is described in detail in , we partially made use of the results on the related higgs decays .",
    "the electroweak nlo corrections have been supplemented by the leading two - loop heavy - higgs - boson effects  @xcite proportional to @xmath10 .    in the @xmath5-channel diagrams intermediate w and z  bosons can become resonant , corresponding to @xmath11 production with subsequent gauge - boson decay . in order to consistently include these resonances",
    ", we use the `` complex - mass scheme '' at the one - loop level  @xcite , which respects all relations that follow from gauge invariance . in this approach the w- and z - boson masses",
    "are consistently considered as complex quantities , defined as the locations of the propagator poles in the complex plane .",
    "the tensor integrals are evaluated using the reduction techniques of refs .",
    "@xcite , which include direct reductions of pentagon integrals to boxes and specific methods to treat exceptional phase - space configurations in a numerically stable way .",
    "real corrections consist of gluon and photon emission and processes with @xmath12 and @xmath13 initial states .",
    "the mass singularities from collinear initial - state splittings are absorbed via factorization by the usual pdf redefinition both for the qcd and photonic corrections .",
    "technically , the soft and collinear singularities are isolated in the dipole subtraction method following , and the result was checked with the phase - space slicing method .",
    "each part of the whole calculation has been worked out twice and independently , and all corrections are implemented in a flexible monte carlo event generator based on multi - channel integration .",
    "numerical results for the higgs - mass dependence and the scale dependence of the total cross section with and without vbf cuts as well as distributions for @xmath14 have been presented in . some distributions for @xmath15",
    "have been published in . here",
    "we summarize the size of the different contributions to the total cross section and show some more distributions for @xmath15 .",
    "all presented results are based on the input parameters as given in .",
    "since quark - mixing effects are suppressed , the ckm matrix is set to the unit matrix .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling is fixed in the @xmath16 scheme , i.e.  it is set to @xmath17 , because this accounts for electromagnetic running effects and some universal corrections of the @xmath18 parameter .",
    "we use the mrst2004qed pdf @xcite which consistently include @xmath19 qed corrections and a photon distribution function for the proton . in our default",
    "set - up we use only four quark flavours for the external partons , i.e.  we do not take into account the contribution of bottom quarks , which is suppressed . partonic processes involving b  quarks",
    "are , however , included in our code in lo .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are set to @xmath20 , 5 flavours are included in the two - loop running of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we apply typical vbf cuts to the outgoing jets as described in detail in .    in",
    "we summarize the impact of different contributions to the integrated cross sections with and without vbf cuts for higgs masses between 120 and @xmath0 , for @xmath23 , and for @xmath24 in per cent of the corresponding lo cross section .",
    "previous calculations of the vbf process @xcite have consistently neglected @xmath5-channel contributions ( `` higgs strahlung '' ) , which involve diagrams where one of the vector bosons can become resonant , as well as the interference between @xmath3- and @xmath4-channel fusion diagrams . for small higgs - boson masses",
    "the contributions of @xmath5-channel diagrams , @xmath25 , range between 10% and 30% when no cuts are applied .",
    "with vbf cuts , the @xmath5-channel contributions are strongly suppressed , yielding less than @xmath26 of the cross section for all the studied higgs - boson masses .",
    "the contributions from interferences between @xmath3- and @xmath4-channel diagrams , @xmath27 , are below @xmath28 with or without vbf cuts and thus negligible . consequently ,",
    "applying typical experimental vbf cuts , the contributions from @xmath5-channel diagrams and @xmath29-channel interferences can be safely neglected .",
    "next , we list in the contributions arising at lo from processes that include b - quarks in the initial and/or final states .",
    "these are included in our programs but not in the default set - up . for higgs - boson masses below @xmath30",
    ", they increase the total cross section without cuts by about 4% and the one with cuts by about 2% . for larger higgs - boson masses",
    "their impact is smaller .    in the lower part of contributions of various nlo corrections",
    "are listed .",
    "both electroweak and qcd corrections are at the level of 510% .",
    "the qcd corrections are dominated by the previously known diagonal contributions , i.e.  by the vector - boson  quark  antiquark vertex corrections to squared lo diagrams , @xmath31 .",
    "all other qcd contributions , i.e.  qcd corrections to interferences between the different lo diagrams and interferences with gg - fusion and g - splitting diagrams ( see for a precise definition ) , summarized in @xmath32 , are at the per - mille level and even partially cancel each other .",
    "they are not enhanced by contributions of two @xmath3- or @xmath4-channel vector bosons with small virtuality and therefore even further suppressed when applying vbf cuts . for the electroweak corrections we give the impact of the quark  quark induced processes , @xmath33 , and the one of the photon induced processes , @xmath34 separately .",
    "the latter turn out to be @xmath35 and reduce the complete electroweak corrections for small higgs - boson masses .",
    "the dominant two - loop correction due to higgs - boson self - interaction , which is contained in @xmath33 , is completely negligible in the low-@xmath36 region , but becomes important for large higgs - boson masses and yields @xmath37 for @xmath24 which constitutes about @xmath38 of the total ew corrections . obviously for higgs masses in this region and above the perturbative expansion breaks down , and",
    "the two - loop factor @xmath39 might serve as an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the ew corrections to distributions for @xmath15 are qualitatively similar to those for @xmath14 presented in .",
    "the distributions in the transverse momentum @xmath40 of the harder tagging jet @xmath41 ( jet with highest @xmath42 passing all cuts ) and the distribution in the azimuthal angle separation of the two tagging jets for @xmath15 have been presented in . here",
    "we show some additional distributions for @xmath15 .    in",
    "we provide the distribution in the transverse momentum @xmath43 of the higgs boson .",
    "the differential cross section drops strongly with increasing @xmath43 . as for @xmath14",
    "both the relative ew and qcd corrections increase in size and reach @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fi : mwp ] shows the rapidity distribution of the higgs boson .",
    "while the qcd corrections distort this shape by about 10% , the relative ew corrections turn out to to be flat where the distribution is sizeable . in ,",
    "we depict the distribution in the rapidity of the harder tagging jet .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the tagging jets are forward and backward located .",
    "the ew corrections vary between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the qcd corrections exhibit a strong dependence on the jet rapidity .",
    "they are about @xmath48 in the central region but become positive for large rapidities , where they tend to compensate the ew corrections .",
    "shape changes due to the full corrections reach @xmath49 .",
    "radiative corrections of strong and electroweak interactions have been discussed at next - to - leading order for higgs - boson production via vector - boson fusion at the lhc .",
    "all discussed effects have been implemented into a flexible monte carlo generator .",
    "the electroweak corrections affect the cross section by @xmath50 , and are thus as important as the qcd corrections in this channel .",
    "they do not simply rescale distributions but induce distortions at the level of 10% .",
    "effects from photon - induced processes , @xmath5-channel contributions , and interferences are small once vector - boson fusion cuts are applied . for intermediate higgs - boson masses",
    "the remaining theoretical uncertainty is below the uncertainty from pdfs and expected experimental errors .",
