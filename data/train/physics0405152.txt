    "electrophoresis is the standard method of dna separation by length ( viovy , 2000 ) .",
    "since the mobility of dna molecules in free solution is independent of their length , the dna is commonly introduced into a gel , which serves as a random sieve .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiency of gel electrophoresis decreases with the length of the dna .",
    "moreover , bioanalytic devices are more and more miniaturized , and incorporating random gels with characteristic pore sizes in the nanometer range into future nanodevices will presumably become increasingly problematic . therefore , much recent effort has been devoted to designing and making well - defined microstructured devices for dna separation ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , han , 1999 ; 2000 ; 2002 ; bader , 1999 ; hammond , 2000 ; duong , 2003 ) .    in this paper , we focus on a geometry proposed by han and coworkers ( han , 1999 ) , which is based on the idea of entropic trapping .",
    "the dna is introduced into a small microchannel with alternating deep regions and shallow constrictions .",
    "the channel thickness in the constrictions is much smaller than the radius of gyration of the dna molecules .",
    "the deep region is large enough to accommodate the equilibrium shape of the dna molecules .",
    "entering the constrictions is thus entropically penalized , and the deep regions can be interpreted as entropic traps . a schematic cartoon of the structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "-direction is much larger ( @xmath0 ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in these structures , han  made the counterintuitive observation that long dna molecules travel _ faster _ than short molecules .",
    "they explained their finding by means of a simple kinetic model . in order to escape from one of the deep regions ,",
    "the dna must overcome an activation barrier @xmath1 .",
    "the escape process is initiated by a thermally activated stretching of a chain portion ( length @xmath2 ) into the shallow constriction .",
    "this costs entropic penalty proportional to @xmath2 , but it also decreases the electric potential energy by an amount @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electric field . hence there exists a critical length @xmath5 , below which the entropy penalty dominates and the chain is driven back into the deep region . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the energy gain dominates and the chain escapes .",
    "the free energy at @xmath7 represents the activation barrier for the escape process .",
    "it depends solely on the electric field , .",
    "the rate of escape attempts , @xmath8 , increases with the chain size , since the amount of polymer in contact with the constriction is larger for larger chains .",
    "the mean trapping time in this simple model is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath11 the boltzmann factor .",
    "this implies that long chains travel faster .",
    "the results of han  have motivated recent monte carlo simulations by tessier  ( 2002 ) .",
    "these authors used the bond fluctuation model , a well - known lattice model for polymers , to study the mobility of polymers in a geometry similar to that suggested by han  within local monte carlo dynamics ( single monomer moves ) .",
    "their results confirm the trapping picture of han , and even details of the kinetic model .",
    "for example , they present evidence that the penetration depth @xmath2 of the chain into the constriction can be used as a `` reaction coordinate '' for escaping , with a critical value @xmath5 .",
    "when looking more closely at the simulation data , one notices that the trapping in the system of tessier  is unexpectedly strong .",
    "although the width of the constriction is more than twice as large as in the experiments ( in units of the persistence length ) , the molecules spend almost the entire time in a trapped state , and very little time traveling , even at intermediate fields .",
    "this effect might be an artifact of the lattice model .",
    "we note that the width of the constriction in the simulations is just 10 lattice constants , while every monomer occupies a cube with 8 lattice sites , and the average bond length is 2.8 lattice constants . moreover , the monte carlo dynamics is not realistic .",
    "monomers are picked and moved randomly ( with some moves being rejected ) , whereas in the real system , they are pulled into the constriction by the electric force .",
    "dynamic monte carlo is known to reproduce diffusional and relaxational dynamics in systems near local equilibrium . nevertheless , it is not clear how well it can be applied to study driven systems .",
    "the details of the dynamics should matter particularly at higher electric fields , in situations where the chains travel so fast that they no longer reach local equilibrium in the traps .",
    "therefore , simulations of off - lattice models with a more realistic dynamical evolution are clearly desirable .    as a first step in this direction , chen and escobedo ( 2003 )",
    "have recently studied the free energy landscape of chains in a single , non - periodic trap with monte carlo simulations of an ( off - lattice ) bead - spring model .",
    "the initial configuration in these simulations is that of a fully relaxed chain in the absence of an electric field .",
    "with that starting point , the free energy barrier @xmath12 turns out to depend on the chain length for short chains , and to level off at higher chain lengths . the data for",
    "@xmath12 do not seem to support the relation @xmath13 . since the simulations still used monte carlo , the results on dynamical properties were limited .    in the present paper , we present brownian dynamics simulations of a full ( non - equilibrium ) periodic array of entropic traps .",
    "we employ a rouse - chain model , such as has been successfully used by others to study the migration of dna in various geometries ( deutsch , 1987 ; 1988 ; matsumoto , 1994 ; noguchi , 2001 ) .",
    "our main result is the observation of a new trapping mechanism in geometries such as fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] , which is at least as important as that suggested by han , and which can also be exploited to achieve molecular separation .",
    "the insight gained from our study should be useful for the design of future , improved molecular separation devices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe and discuss the model and give some technical details on the simulation .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we model a single dna molecule as a chain with pairwise interactions @xmath14 this potential describes soft , purely repulsive interactions between beads of diameter @xmath15 .",
    "the beads are connected by springs with the spring potential @xmath16 the spring constant was chosen very large , @xmath17 , in order to prevent chain crossings .",
    "the molecule is confined in a structured channel with a geometry similar to that used by han .",
    "the thickness of the shallow constrictions and thick regions is @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , the length of a deep region is 80 @xmath15 , and the total length of a period is @xmath20 . in the lateral direction",
    ", the channel is infinite .",
    "the chain beads are repelled from the walls of the channel by means of a wall potential essentially identical to ( [ eq : lennard - jones ] ) , , where @xmath21 is the distance of a bead to the closest wall point .",
    "the details of the wall potential do not influence the results , as long as it is repulsive and short ranged .",
    "note that the effective width of the channel , _ i.  e. _ , the width of the space accessible to a bead , is reduced by @xmath22 with this potential . a snapshot of a chain in such a channel is shown in fig . [ fig : snapshot ] .",

    "we assume that the charges do not interact with one another .",
    "this will be discussed further below .",
    "the distribution of the electric potential @xmath25 in the channel was calculated numerically by solving the laplace equation with von neumann boundary conditions at the walls , where @xmath26 is the surface normal ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system is described by a kramer s equations ( risken , 1989 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total force acting on bead @xmath29 , and @xmath30 its velocity , and @xmath31 is a friction coefficient .",
    "the random noise @xmath32 fulfills @xmath33 with @xmath34 or @xmath35 . the random noise and the friction mimics the effect of the solvent surrounding the dna .",
    "the chains differ from standard rouse chains ( doi , 1986 ) by their excluded volume interactions and by the inertia @xmath36 of the beads . with the parameters of our model ( @xmath37 , see the discussion further below ) , the chains exhibit rouse dynamics on length scales of the order the gyration radius of the chain , @xmath38 ( streek , 2002 ) .",
    "several important physical factors are neglected in the model .",
    "first , electrostatic interactions within dna chains are not taken into account .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the debye screening length in typical electrophoresis buffers is only a few @xmath39 , comparable to the diameter of the double helix .",
    "second , we do not consider electro - osmotic flow , or flow in general .",
    "this reflects the experimental situation reported by han .",
    "third , hydrodynamic interactions are disregarded .",
    "this is partly justified by the theoretical observation that for polyelectrolytes dragged by an electric field , the hydrodynamic interactions should be screened over distances larger than the debye length , since the counterions are dragged in the opposite direction ( viovy , 2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the argument is only strictly valid as long as no non - electric forces are present ( long , 1996 ) . in our case ,",
    "the walls of the channels exert non - electrical forces which stop the polymers , but do not prevent the counterions in the debye layer from moving .",
    "thus the chains experience an additional trapping force from the friction of the counterions .",
    "this effect is disregarded in our model .",
    "furthermore , diffusion is not treated correctly even in free solution .",
    "the diffusion constant of rouse chains scales as @xmath40 with the chain length @xmath41 .",
    "including hydrodynamic interactions , one expects zimm scaling @xmath42 , where the gyration radius @xmath38 scales like for self - avoiding chains .",
    "experimentally , the diffusion constant of dna in typical buffer solutions is found to scale as @xmath43 ( stellwagen , 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , a full treatment which accounts correctly both for the ( dynamically varying ) counterion distribution as well as the hydrodynamic interactions is not feasible with standard computational resources .",
    "the simplifications of our model influence the results quantitatively , but do presumably not change them by orders of magnitude . the qualitative behavior should not be affected .",
    "keeping these caveats in mind , we can now proceed to establish a quantitative connection with the experimental setup of han .",
    "the natural units in our model are related to the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath31 , @xmath44 ( the charge per bead ) , and @xmath10 ( the temperature ) .",
    "more specifically , the energy unit is @xmath45 , the length unit is @xmath15 , the time unit is , and the electric field unit is @xmath46 . throughout the paper , all quantities shall be given in terms of these natural units .",
    "they shall now be related to real ( si ) units .",
    "since the experiments are carried out at room temperature , the energy unit is @xmath47 .",
    "the length unit is obtained from matching the persistence length of the model chains , @xmath48 ( streek , 2002 ) with that of dna , @xmath49 , yielding @xmath50 .",
    "the persistence of the chain is also used to determine the number of base pairs ( bp ) per bead .",
    "a dna molecule contains approximately 150 bp on a stretch of length @xmath51 . in our model ,",
    "the average bond length between two beads is @xmath52 ( streek , 2002 ) , thus we have 1.9 beads per persistence length , and one bead represents roughly 80 bp . the elongation for a chain crossing with minimal energy is @xmath53 , which corresponds to an energy barrier @xmath54 for crossing .",
    "the boltzmann - factor for this energy barrier turns out to be less than @xmath55 . to check the simulation program ,",
    "the bond length distribution was compared to the boltzmann - factor and very good agreement was found .",
    "furthermore , no bond ever exceeded a length of @xmath56 .",
    "thus no chain crossing occured in our simulations .",
    "the time scale @xmath57 is calculated from the diffusion constant @xmath58 . for rouse chains of length @xmath41 , @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 experimentally , stellwagen  ( 2003 ) have recently reported the relation @xmath60 choosing as reference a chain of length 40 kbp ( @xmath61 ) , we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the unit of the electric field can be identified from matching the mobility @xmath63 of free chains .",
    "the theoretical value is @xmath64 . in experiments ,",
    "the mobility depends strongly on the choice of the buffer .",
    "unfortunately , han  do not report explicit measurements of the free - chain mobility of dna in the buffer used in their experiments . in the microchannel",
    ", they observe that the overall mobility saturates at high field strengths .",
    "the apparent maximum mobility @xmath65 results from an average over a slow motion in the reduced electric field of the deep regions , and a fast motion in the enhanced electric field of the constrictions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snapshot ] ) . for large periods @xmath66 ,",
    "the ratio of these two field strengths is simply the inverse of the thickness ratio @xmath67 .",
    "one can then derive a relation between the true free chain mobility @xmath63 and the apparent mobility @xmath65 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the relative lengths for the deep regions and shallow constrictions , respectively ( @xmath71 ) .",

    "however , the results of stellwagen  can probably not be applied here , because the mobility depends strongly on the buffer .",

    "the depth of the constriction was @xmath86 in the experiments .",

    "when comparing field strengths , we must keep in mind that the electric field in the channel is not homogeneous ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] ) . in our geometry , the electric field in the constriction",
    "is enhanced by a factor of 2.5 . in the experimental setup ,",
    "the enhancement factor is only @xmath96 , due to the fact that the length ratio between the shallow and deep regions is different ( 50:50 in the experiment , 20:80 in the simulations ) .",
    "the ratio of field strengths in the shallow and deep regions in our simulations is roughly 4 . in the experimental geometry ,",
    "it is @xmath97 for large periods @xmath98 and smaller otherwise .",

    "we note that the actual value of the mass has no influence on the static properties of the chain ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , the chain flexibility ) , nor on the diffusive part of the dynamics .",

    "( [ eq : tau ] ) may also depend on @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting @xmath4-dependence can be rather complex . in the field range of our simulation",
    ", the resulting relation can be approximated by the empirical law .",
    "like the fast time scale , the slow time scale also decreases with the chain length , but the dependence here is very weak .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of the data was not sufficient for a quantitative analysis .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , then characterizes an escape from a low - force region .",
    "we note that extended chains in a corner experience a net electric force towards the wall , even though the field lines of course never enter the wall ( see fig .",

    "the chain must either move against the force , or change its shape . in both cases",
    ", it has to overcome a free energy barrier before it can get rescued from the field lines .",
    "a simple ansatz would predict the escape probability to be proportional to the diffusion constant @xmath148 , and to the area covered by the chain , @xmath149 , or the total chain length @xmath41 .",
    "this would yield a very weak net chain length dependence @xmath150 or @xmath151 , which is consistent with the observed behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ) .",
    "thus the slow time scale itself does not contribute much to the chain length dependence of the mobility .",
    "the main effect comes from the fact that the _ relative number _ of chains caught in the field - free region depends on the chain length .",
    "the travel time from one channel to the next for undeflected chains is slightly smaller than @xmath152 .",
    "we assume that chains have to diffuse at least over a distance @xmath153 into the field - free region ( direction @xmath154 , see fig .",

    "scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we can test this prediction under the assumption that the two time scales @xmath135 and @xmath136 are sufficiently far apart that they can be separated . in that case , one can choose a time @xmath143 such that almost all undeflected chains have left the trap , while almost all deflected chains are still in the field - free region .",
    "@xmath161 can then be approximated by the relative number @xmath162 of chains left in the field - free region at the time @xmath143 .",
    "[ fig : pcum ] shows the result of such an estimate .",

    "to summarize , we have presented the first off - lattice brownian dynamics simulation of dna migration in an entropic trap array .",
    "we reproduce the experimentally observed phenomenon that the mobility increases with the chain length .",
    "this result can be traced back to two distinct mechanisms .",
    "the first mechanism has already been discussed by han : chains get delayed at the narrow channels connecting the traps .",
    "they escape through the channels with a probability which is proportional to the radius of gyration of the chain and thus scales as @xmath174 .",
    "however , we found that this effect accounts only in part for the total chain length dependence . in the second mechanism ,",
    "the chains are trapped with a certain probability at the side and in the corner of the box .",
    "the characteristic time for escaping such a configuration is very long .",
    "the trapping probability increases with the diffusion constant , which is in turn inversely proportional to the chain length . as a result ,",
    "the mobility increases with the chain length .    to our best knowledge",
    ", this mechanism has not yet been described in the literature .",
    "it becomes relevant when the period @xmath98 of the structure is small .",
    "indeed , han  have studied structures with periods ranging from @xmath175 to @xmath176 @xmath177 ( han , 1999 ) , but they reported separation by length only for their smallest structure with @xmath178 , in a system with dimensions comparable to those studied here .    we have observed a number of other phenomena , which we shall not describe in detail here .",
    "in contrast to chen  ( chen , 2003 ) , we have considered truly non - equilibrium systems .",
    "subsequent escapes can not necessarily be considered as independent events .",
    "the longest chains @xmath109 do not recover the equilibrium coil structure in the middle of the trap , but they remain stretched in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "moreover , our data seem to provide evidence that chains even retain some memory of the previous escape process . at high fields ,",
    "successive escape times seem to be correlated .",
    "unfortunately , the statistical quality of the data is not good enough to allow for a more thorough analysis .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated when the shallow channel is made wider .",
    "whereas in the cases presented here , long chains migrated faster than short chains , we have observed the inverse effect in microfluidic system with wider channels ( duong , 2003 ) .",
    "the effect as well as other , even more unexpected phenomena , can be reproduced in simulations .",
