    "the knowledge of the absolute mass of at least one mass eigenstate or one neutrino flavour opens new windows for progress in the mentioned fields : for verification of mass generating models of the standard model it would be a crucial test if the models predict correctly the still unmeasured hierarchy or degeneracy amongst the mass eigenstates . within the hierarchical models , the classification into normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy is another benchmark for verification between such models . also cosmological important questions like the composition of the energy density of the universe , or the theory of large scale structure evolution rely on the knowledge of the absolute neutrino masses . + here in this article ,",
    "current and scheduled experiments , which aim to measure the neutrino mass with sub - ev sensitivity are listed and compared against each other .",
    "an introductionary section of neutrino mixing ( sec.[sec_mixing ] ) is given to emphasize that the masses derived from cosmology ( sec.[sec_cosmo ] ) , neutrinoless double beta decay searches ( sec.[sec_nnbb ] ) and single beta decay spectroscopy ( sec.[sec_singleb ] ) differ in their meanings . in sec.[sec comparison ] the systematic differences amongst the methods are compared .",
    "the question if neutrinos are even massive has been answered clearly positive by neutrino oscillation experiments in recent years .",
    "these results establish , that the leptonic neutrino eigenstates @xmath3 are superpositions of 3 mass eigenstates @xmath1 : @xmath4 the mixing matrix u can be parameterized as a product of a 3x3 matrix ( with 4 mixing angles and 1 cp violating phase ) and a diagonal matrix @xmath5 with 2 majorana phases @xmath6@xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations experiments are exclusively sensitive to the 3x3 matrix and the differences of the squared mass eigenstates @xmath7 .",
    "+ by measuring the mass of one neutrino flavor ( e.g. @xmath8 ) the masses of the other two flavors can be derived through the mixing matrix and the @xmath9 as measured or constrained from oscillation experiments .",
    "the laboratory measurements focus exclusively on the electron neutrino mass @xmath10 as here the highest experimental sensitivity on the mass is given .",
    "the existence of neutrino mixing means that care has to be taken in comparing `` neutrino masses '' from different observations . the observable in single beta decay experiments ( see sec.[sec_singleb ] ) @xmath11 is given as @xmath12 the masses derived from neutrinoless double beta decay searches ( ): @xmath13 instead are dependant on the majorana phases @xmath6 . only in the case of vanishing majorana phases , equals , otherwise @xmath14 .",
    "the neutrino mass  derived from cosmological observation @xmath15 is the sum over the mass eigenstates independent of the mixing matrix u. + from the neutrino oscillation measurements boundaries on , and can be inferred due to the constraint @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following benchmarks for experimental sensitivities :    * if ( , ) is below 0.2 ( 0.1,0.6 ) , degenerate models are excluded .",

    "experiments with sensitivities of @xmath18 m  have the potential to exclude inverted mass models . * a lower bound of @xmath19 mcan be inferred , equivalent to @xmath20 m , independant of mass hierachy . for the lower bound can approach zero due to the mentioned cancellation effects by the majorana phases .",
    "the neutrino density @xmath21 is one parameter out of 11 in the standard cosmological model .",
    "the density is related to the number of massive neutrinos and the neutrino mass by @xmath22 where h is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc . as expressed by eq.[omeganu ] cosmological data determines the incoherent sum of all neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "massive neutrinos contribute to the cosmological matter density @xmath23 , but get non - relativistic so late that perturbations in neutrinos up to scales around the causal horizon at matter - radiation equality is suppressed .",

    "the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum from large scale structure ( lss ) surveys is by now the most often used measurement to access matter distributions . at present there exist two large galaxy surveys with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite and the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfrg)@xcite . the statistics and systematic understanding of these data samples allowed the first observation of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao)peak @xcite- well known from cmb observations- in galaxy distributions . including bao helps to break the degenarcy of @xmath25 with the number of neutrino species @xmath26 but also determines@xmath23 more reliable @xcite .",

    "currently the most precise measurement of the lya power spectrum comes from the sloan digital sky survey [ 19 , 20 ] .    for breaking degeneracies amongst the cosmological parameters ,",
    "the lss data is preferably combined with data from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . here",
    ", use of wmap data is standard but also further inclusion of other data sets ( e.g. acbar , cbi , vsa , boomerang ) , which are more sensitive to high multipole modes , exist .",

    "the snls catalog is widely used in this context .      table 1 shows examples of different analyses .",
    "the table claims certainly no completeness of the many analysdes published in the recent years , especially since the release of wmap , 2dfgrs and sdss data .",

    "upper limits @xmath28 in the range of @xmath29 { \\mbox{$\\rm ev$}}$ ] can be inferred when analyzing exclusively single data sets or combining them just with one other . when combining several data sets sub - ev limits are obtained , where those in the range @xmath30{\\mbox{$\\rm ev$}}$ ] are regarded as robust and are often quoted in publications .",
    "by adding more information the limits can even be pushed .",

    "double beta decay is an allowed rare transition between two nuclei with the same mass number ( a ) that changes the nuclear charge ( z ) by two units .",
    "the decay only occurs if the initial nucleus is less bound than the final one , and both must be more bound than the intermediate nucleus .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled in nature for many even - even nuclei , and the double beta decay has been observed for many isotopes .    on the other hand , the neutrinoless decay , @xmath71 violates lepton number conservation and is therefore forbidden in the standard electroweak theory .",
    "the process is mediated by an exchange of a light neutrino , which must be a majorana particle .",
    "the experimental signature of the process is the simultaneous emission of 2 electrons , where the sum of their kinetic energies add up to a monoenergetic line at the position of the q - value of the decay .",
    "thus , the experimental observable are number or upper limits of signal counts or equivalent half - lives @xmath72 .",
    "the decay rate is proportional to the square of the effective majorana mass : @xmath73 denotes the exact calculable phase space factor and  is the matrix element for the nuclear transition , which must be theoretically calculated , as they are not related @xmath74 to the measurable matrix elements in normal double beta decay .",

    "substantial efforts are undertaken in searches to access the = 50 mev region to distinguish between normal and inverted mass hierachy in the neutrino sector .",

    "the last experiments were performed by the mainz@xcite and troitsk@xcite group .",

    "the highest sensitivity on the mass scale of neutrinos comes from cosmological observations .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the quoted limits on  are only valid within the used cosmological model and also depend on the priors used for the parameters . additionally , there is also model - dependance due to astrophysical uncertainties e.g. the bias between dark matter and galaxies @xcite .",
    "input from laboratory measurements will help to improve the systematics of cosmological analysis .",
    "a showcase for this is the correlation of the equation of state of dark energy @xmath102 with  in a flat @xmath103 cold dark matter standard model .",

    "also it as been shown ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) that the combining of laboratory measurements with cosmological observations improves siginificantly the sensitivity on  and help to constrain cosmological models .",
    "+ from the laboratory measurements the masses from show a higher sensitivity compared to the single beta decay method .",
    "nevertheless , the model dependance arises from the fact that  can only occur if neutrinos are majorana particles . on the other hand ,",
    "examining the experimental possibilities of future experiments it looks like as the  searches are the only way to explore neutrino masses below 100 m under laboratory conditions . as the uncertainty on the nuclear natrix element is a severe drawback for the  measurement , efforts are undertaken to improve the calculations .",
    "for example , in reference @xcite it is claimed that the uncertainty can be reduced to @xmath105 when the matrix elements are computed within a continuum qrpa ansatz .",
    "+ model - independant limits arise exclusively from single beta decay analysis .",
    "theses limits can be regarded as conservative as it always holds that @xmath106 .",
    "several next generation experiments are under way , all with the sensitivity to answer within the next years if neutrinos are degenerated and if the neutrino mass is a crucial parameter for cosmological questions .",
    "as the methods are complimentary to each other in the sense that they measure different superpositions of the mass eigenstates a reliable answer to these fundamental questions can be expected .",
    "the most clean answer to that will come from the katrin experiment . for exploring mass regions below 100 mev the model - dependant approaches of cosmology and  have to be applied , at least on the time scale of the next decade .",
