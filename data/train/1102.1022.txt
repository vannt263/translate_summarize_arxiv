    "the simple `` closed - box '' model of galaxy evolution @xcite predicts a correlation between the stellar mass and the gas - phase metallicity of a galaxy ( the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ) .",
    "such a relation is indeed seen in the nearby universe @xcite . and is found to be in place out to @xmath18 @xcite , progressively evolving to lower metallicities . tracing the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and its evolution to even earlier times will provide insight into the earliest epochs of galaxy evolution , while allowing us to probe the relative importance of various galactic - scale phenomena proposed at @xmath13 .",
    "however , studying the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation beyond @xmath16 is challenging because the nebular emission lines required for robust metallicity measurements ( e.g. , h@xmath19 , h@xmath20 , n@xmath21ii @xmath22 , o@xmath21iii @xmath23 , o@xmath21ii @xmath24 ) shift into different near- and mid - ir wavebands , where existing spectrographs have reduced sensitivity compared to the optical band .",
    "this is aggravated by the faintness of the galaxies , making individual abundance measurements nearly impossible .    an alternative way to determine metallicities at @xmath25 ( and in principle at @xmath26 and beyond @xcite )",
    "is absorption spectroscopy of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) optical / near - ir afterglows .",
    "long - duration grbs are known to be associated with the deaths of massive stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , and therefore with sites of active star formation .",
    "the large optical luminosities of grb afterglows and their intrinsic featureless spectra provide a unique way to measure interstellar medium ( ism ) metallicities for galaxies at @xmath27 from rest - frame ultraviolet metal absorption lines and ly@xmath19 absorption . since the afterglows are significantly brighter than the underlying host galaxies , this technique allows us to measure metallicities independent of the galaxy brightness .",
    "this approach has now been exploited at least to @xmath28 using optical spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and with near - ir spectrographs it can be implemented to @xmath29 .",
    "naturally , to explore the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation at @xmath25 we also require a determination of the grb host galaxy stellar masses , and hence follow - up infrared observations with the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope to probe the rest - frame optical luminosity .",
    "we present the first large set of _ spitzer _",
    "observations for grb host galaxies at @xmath2 , and combine the inferred masses with measured metallicities to explore the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation beyond @xmath30 .",
    "a full analysis is presented in laskar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , to be submitted to apj .",
    "we obtained deep observations ( about 2 hr per target ) of 20 long - duration grb host galaxies in the range @xmath31 using the 3.6 @xmath32 m  band of the infra - red array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) on - board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "the effective wavelength of the irac 3.6 @xmath32 m  band probes the rest - frame spectral energy distribution ( sed ) redward of about 5500 and therefore provides a robust measure of the stellar mass .",
    "we used optical afterglow images to perform relative astrometry on the _ spitzer _  mosaics and to locate the grb hosts . at the depth of our observations , _",
    "spitzer _",
    "images are confusion - limited for faint sources , requiring us to model and subtract nearby contaminating sources in 3 cases .",
    "we detect 5 grb hosts at 3.6 @xmath32 m  ( grbs 050319 , 050814 , 060707 , 060210 , and 060926 ) , with flux densities ranging from about 0.55 to 1.65 @xmath5jy , with a typical upper limit of about 0.25 @xmath5jy ( 3@xmath33 ) . to assess the typical flux density of the non - detected hosts we carry out a stacking analysis of 11 non - detections with accurate relative astrometry .",
    "the stacked image does not show a detection down to a 3@xmath33 limit of @xmath34 njy .",
    "+      computing stellar masses from observed luminosities in a given wave - band requires knowledge of the mass - to - light ratio and hence the stellar population age and metallicity . when multi - band photometry is available , modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using stellar population synthesis models can be used to determine stellar masses , provided that a single stellar population is assumed . when multi - band photometry is not available , the resulting uncertainty in the mass - to - light ratio ( e.g. , at @xmath35 @xmath32 m ) is about an order of magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here",
    ", since we lack broad - band photometry , we determine a range of mass - to - light ratios for each galaxy in the observed 3.6 @xmath32 m  band using a wide range of population ages and the single stellar population models of @xcite with a salpeter imf and assuming an instantaneous burst of star formation ( e - folding time , @xmath36 ) .",
    "as expected , the 3.6 @xmath32 m  mass - to - light ratio for these models increases with stellar population age beyond @xmath37 myr .",
    "an upper bound on the mass - to - light ratio is achieved by setting the stellar population age to the age of the universe at each host redshift ( @xmath38 gyr at the median redshift of our sample ) .",
    "we stress that this leads to a very conservative maximum mass for each host galaxy since studies of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and ly@xmath19 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath25 indicate typical population ages of @xmath39 gyr @xcite . the median age for long - duration grb hosts at @xmath40 of about 70 myr @xcite is probably more typical .",
    "the variation in mass - to - light ratio between these age values is about an order of magnitude .",
    "the maximal masses inferred for our sample are @xmath41 m@xmath4 , while the typical ( maximal ) upper limits are @xmath42 m@xmath4 .",
    "the masses inferred for a 70 myr old population are about @xmath43 m@xmath4 , with typical upper limits of @xmath44 m@xmath4 .",
    "the mass limit from the stack of 11 grb hosts is @xmath45 m@xmath4 for a 70 myr old population , and @xmath46 m@xmath4 for the maximal age .",
    "we also include a literature sample of 5 long - duration grb hosts at @xmath25 , incorporating two detections with maximal masses of @xmath47 m@xmath4 ( grb060510b ; @xcite ) and @xmath48 m@xmath4 ( grb080607 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a typical optical afterglow spectrum exhibits a wide range of ism absorption features due to rest - frame uv transitions of low- and high - ionization metal species , which allow a direct determination of the column density of these elements along the grb line of sight through the host galaxy .",
    "combined with a determination of the neutral hydrogen column density via the ly@xmath19 line , it is possible to determine the ism abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use s@xmath21ii , when available , as a measure of the metallicity , primarily since sulfur is not strongly depleted onto dust .",
    "we also place lower limits on the metallicity using si@xmath21ii , si@xmath21iv and c@xmath21ii detections reported by @xcite .    of the 18 grbs in our sample , six have determined [ s / h ] values ,",
    "five have no metallicity information , and six have upper limits on their metallicity from non - detections of s@xmath21ii as well as lower limits based on si@xmath21ii or si@xmath21iv detections . for grb050908 , the metallicity upper limit ( @xmath49 z@xmath50 ) is not meaningful and we only report a lower limit based on a c@xmath21ii detection . using these values we find a wide range of metallicities ( using the solar abundance values from @xcite ) : @xmath51 z@xmath4 for the _ spitzer_-detected grb hosts , which have stellar masses of @xmath52 m@xmath4 .",
    "we divide the grbs with available metallicity information ( either a metallicity detection or a bounded range ) into two mass bins  the 3.6 @xmath32 m  detections with @xmath53 m@xmath50 ( group 1 ) and the objects included in the stack ( group 2 ) . for each group",
    ", we perform a monte carlo simulation to estimate the mean metallicity , yielding @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 intervals ) . for group 1 ,",
    "the mean of the maximum inferred stellar masses is @xmath57 m@xmath50 , while that of the masses inferred from the 70 myr populations is @xmath58 m@xmath50 . to obtain mass estimates for group 2 , we scale our stack limit obtained for 11 non - detections by @xmath59 . using the mean maximum mass - to - light ratio of the objects in group 2 yields an upper limit on the mean stellar mass of these seven objects of @xmath60 , while using the mean mass - to - light ratio at 70 myr yields a mass limit of @xmath61 .    in figure 2",
    ", we present the absorption line metallicities plotted versus the stellar masses inferred from our _ spitzer _",
    "observations and the literature studies .",
    "the 6 grb hosts that do not have any constraints on their ism metallicity are excluded from this plot .",
    "we find that our two points fall below the observed relations at @xmath62 , providing evidence that the galaxy @xmath0-@xmath1 relation continues to evolve at @xmath2 , with our stack range probing a somewhat lower mass scale than the lbg studies at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "and @xmath64 intervals for estimates of the mean metallicity at two mass bins of @xmath65 m@xmath4 ( 3.6 @xmath5 m detections ) and @xmath66 m@xmath4 ( scaled stack limit - see text ) .",
    "the dashed vertical line indicates the upper limit on the mean mass of the stack for a 70 myr population .",
    "these data are consistent with a decline in metallicity with lower stellar mass  an @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* filled squares ) ; the curves at @xmath71 are @xmath0-@xmath1 relations re - calibrated by @xcite .",
    "our two points at @xmath2 fall below these relations , suggesting that the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation continues to evolve to @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig : mz ] ]",
    "we present the first study of the galaxy mass - metallicity relation at redshifts of @xmath2 using grb afterglow absorption metallicities and _ spitzer _  follow - up observations .",
    "five of the 20 grb hosts in our sample are detected above a 3@xmath33 flux density threshold of 0.25 @xmath5jy , corresponding to a typical stellar mass of @xmath73 m@xmath4 .",
    "we further place a limit of @xmath74 m@xmath4 on the non - detected hosts based on a stacking analysis .    using the metallicities of the host galaxies ( inferred mainly from s@xmath21ii ) we find a range of @xmath75 at a fixed stellar mass of @xmath65 m@xmath4 .",
    "the mean metallicity at this mass scale is about @xmath76 z@xmath4 .",
    "the mean metallicity associated with 7 of the 11 the non - detected hosts , which have an upper limit of @xmath66 m@xmath4 , is @xmath15 z@xmath4 .",
    "thus , there appears to be an overall decline in metallicity with decreasing mass , a hint of an @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "furthermore , our two points on the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation lie below the relations at lower redshifts , suggesting that the relation continues to evolve at least to @xmath77 .",
    "clearly , additional observations are required to confirm and increase the statistical significance of this result .",
    "a sample of 20 additional grbs at @xmath25 from 2007 through the present is available for study .",
    "this will allow us to double the existing sample .    the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( jwst ) will provide a much deeper view of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation at high redshift .",
    "for instance , the nircam instrument on jwst will allow us to detect grb hosts at @xmath30 down to a mass of @xmath78 m@xmath4 , and at @xmath79 to @xmath80 m@xmath4 with similar integration times as our observations .",
    "equally important , the nirspec instrument ( @xmath81 @xmath32 m ) will allow us to determine emission - line metallicities for some of the hosts , and hence to cross - calibrate the afterglow absorption metallicities . with on - going afterglow absorption metallicity measurements",
