    "the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) , detected by wilson ( 1955 ) on plates of the palomar sky survey , is at @xmath11 ( j2000.0 ; mateo 1998 ) on the sky .",
    "its galactic coordinates are @xmath12 .",
    "several published estimates of the distance to ursa minor disagree by more than their combined uncertainties .",
    "olszewski & aaronson ( 1985 ) and cudworth , olszewski , & schommer ( 1986 ) determine a distance modulus , @xmath13 , of @xmath14 , which corresponds to a heliocentric distance of @xmath15  kpc .",
    "these two studies are not independent because they use the same photometric calibration .",
    "this distance is in agreement with those measured by nemec , wehlau , & mendes de oliveira ( 1988 ) , @xmath16  kpc , and mighell  &  burke ( 1999 ) , @xmath17  kpc .",
    "the latter value comes from @xmath18 and @xmath19 images of the central region in ursa minor taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "however , carrera  ( 2002 ) determine @xmath20 , which gives a distance of @xmath21  kpc ( note an erroneous entry of 70  kpc for the distance in their table  3 ) .",
    "bellazzini  ( 2002 ) find a similar value : @xmath22 .",
    "about 0.3  mag of the 0.41  mag difference between the distance moduli of cudworth , olszewski , & schommer ( 1986 ) and bellazzini  ( 2002 ) comes from different values for the absolute magnitude of the horizontal branch .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this article to resolve the uncertainties in the globular cluster distance scale , however the larger distance is based on more modern stellar models and is probably in better agreement with hipparcos parallaxes for subdwarfs ( reid 2003 ; gratton  2003 ) and the age of the universe derived by wmap ( bennett  2003 ) .",
    "thus , this study adopts a distance of 76  kpc for the purpose of deriving distance - dependent quantities .",
    "ursa minor is one of the least luminous galactic dsphs .",
    "irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 : ih hereafter ) report its luminosity to be @xmath23 .",
    "reflecting their larger estimate of the distance , carrera  ( 2002 ) report @xmath24 .",
    "these luminosities are based on the structural parameters from ih : a core radius of @xmath25  arcmin and a tidal radius of @xmath26  arcmin .",
    "kleyna  ( 1998 ) find similar structural parameters for ursa minor .",
    "however , martnez - delgado  ( 2001 ) and palma  ( 2003 ) find a more extended radial profile , which implies a larger luminosity .",
    "palma  ( 2003 ) determine that both blue horizontal branch stars and stars identified as giants on the basis of photometry in the washington - band system extend beyond the tidal radius of ih .",
    "they argue that the luminosity of ursa minor is 2.7@xmath27 larger than the value of ih .",
    "based on both the larger radial extent and the larger distance , bellazzini  ( 2002 ) adopt a luminosity of @xmath28 .",
    "our study likewise adopts this value .",
    "several studies find that the stars of ursa minor are old , metal - poor , and of similar age .",
    "olszewski & aaronson ( 1985 ) constructed a @xmath18 _ versus _",
    "@xmath29 color - magnitude diagram for the dsph using data from ground - based observations .",
    "the diagram reveals that the stars of ursa minor have ages and metallicities similar to those of the metal - poor globular cluster m92 .",
    "the study interprets the few stars brighter and bluer than the main - sequence turnoff as blue stragglers .",
    "carrera  ( 2002 ) confirm this basic picture using ground - based data in the @xmath30 , @xmath18 , @xmath31 , and @xmath19 bands .",
    "an analysis of hst data by mighell & burke ( 1999 ) reveals the same picture : the stars of ursa minor are about 14  gyr old , formed in a single burst that lasted less than 2 gyr , and are metal - poor  with a metallicity @xmath32 } \\approx -2.2 $ ]  dex .",
    "all of these characteristics indicate that the stars in ursa minor formed in a single burst during the earliest stages of the formation of our galaxy .",
    "ursa minor has little or no gas : searches for neutral hydrogen by young ( 2000 ) and for ionized hydrogen by gallagher ( 2003 ) yield no positive detections , only placing upper limits of @xmath33 on hi and @xmath34 on hii .",
    "the absence of gas is consistent with the old stellar population in ursa minor ; however , the question of why ursa minor quickly stopped forming stars whereas the similar dsph carina did not remains unanswered .    with the possible exception of sagittarius ,",
    "ursa minor has the greatest flattening among the known galactic dsphs .",
    "ih derive an ellipticity of @xmath35 and a position angle for the major axis of @xmath36  degrees .",
    "kleyna  ( 1998 ) derive similar values .",
    "the ellipticity of ursa minor is distinctly larger than those of the other dsphs ( again excluding sagittarius ) , which range from 0.1 to 0.35 ( ih ) .",
    "the left - hand panel in figure  [ fields ] shows a @xmath37 section of the sky in the direction of ursa minor from the digitized sky survey .",
    "the dashed and solid ellipses delineate the core and tidal radii of ursa minor from ih .",
    "hartwick & sargent ( 1978 ) and aaronson ( 1983 ) were the first to measure radial velocities for 12 stars in ursa minor , finding a systemic velocity of about @xmath38  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "hargreaves ( 1994 ) find a mean heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath39  km  s@xmath1 from the radial velocities of 35 giants .",
    "armandroff , olszewski , & pryor ( 1995 ) combined the data from hargreaves ( 1994 ) and from olszewski , aaronson , & hill ( 1995 ) with their own measurements to obtain mean radial velocities for a sample of 94 stars .",
    "excluding one possible non - member , the mean heliocentric radial velocity is @xmath40  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "our study adopts this last value .",
    "the adopted value is in a reasonable agreement with the most recent determination of this quantity by wilkinson ( 2004 ) , who derive @xmath41 km  s@xmath1 from the measured radial velocities for 162 stars .",
    "the dispersion of velocities within a dsph provides information about its mass and how the mass is distributed .",
    "aaronson & olszewski ( 1987 ) report a velocity dispersion for ursa minor of @xmath42  km  s@xmath1 from radial velocities of seven stars .",
    "this dispersion indicated for the first time that the mass greatly exceeds that expected from stars alone .",
    "subsequent measurements have confirmed the large dispersion : hargreaves  ( 1994 ) find @xmath43  km  s@xmath1 from a sample of 35 giants and armandroff , olszewski , & pryor ( 1995 ) find @xmath44  km  s@xmath1 from a sample of 93 giants .",
    "the larger sample of radial velocities in wilkinson  ( 2004 ) provides information on the dependence of velocity dispersion on the projected radius .",
    "the bottom panel of their figure  1 shows that the velocity dispersion is constant at about 12  km  s@xmath1 to a radius of approximately 32  arcmin ; beyond this radius , the velocity dispersion drops sharply to about 2  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "hargreaves  ( 1994 ) and armandroff , olszewski , & pryor ( 1995 ) assume virial equilibrium , that light follows mass , and the luminosity and structural parameters from ih to calculate a mass - to - light ratio in solar units , @xmath45 , of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty for the second of these values includes only the contribution from the velocity dispersion , whereas the uncertainty for the first value includes the contributions from all of the relevant parameters . making the same assumptions and using one of the above velocity dispersions , ih , kleyna  ( 1998 ) , and carrera  ( 2002 )",
    "infer similarly large values of @xmath48 : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and 70 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , palma  ( 2003 ) find @xmath51 .",
    "they derive a surface density profile from a sample of stars selected to be members of ursa minor using three - color washington - band photometry .",
    "fitting a king model to this profile produces a tidal radius of @xmath52  arcmin . this value is larger than those derived by ih and kleyna  ( 1998 ) , which affects the derived mass and luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "palma  ( 2003 ) also note that the @xmath53 could be even smaller if the velocity dispersion tensor of the dsph is anisotropic .",
    "richstone  &  tremaine ( 1986 ) caution that the @xmath53 calculated using king s method will be overestimated or underestimated depending on whether the velocity dispersion is larger in the radial or tangential directions , respectively . despite a lack of any evidence for an anisotropic dispersion tensor , palma  ( 2003 ) conclude that the @xmath48 of ursa minor may be as low as 16 .",
    "the larger distance , hence larger luminosity , found by bellazzini  ( 2002 ) further reduces the lower limit on the @xmath48 to 7 .",
    "palma  ( 2003 ) note that a power law with an index of @xmath54 is a better fit to the surface density profile of ursa minor at radii between 20  arcmin and 100  arcmin than is a king model .",
    "they argue that such a profile indicates that the galactic tidal force has produced a halo of escaping stars around the dsph .",
    "they also argue that a @xmath53 near the lower limit allowed by the uncertainty in the mass estimate is more consistent with a picture in which `` this system is very likely undergoing significant mass loss due to its tidal interaction with the milky way . ''",
    "gmez - flechoso  &  martnez - delgado ( 2003 ) have made the above argument more quantitative .",
    "they derive @xmath55 for ursa minor by evolving an @xmath56-body model of the dsph in a potential of the milky way on an orbit constrained by the proper motion of the dsph from schweitzer , cudworth , & majewski ( 1997 ) , varying the @xmath53 of the dsph in order to match the surface brightness profile of the model dsph with the observed profile .",
    "the study finds that an acceptable match exists only if ursa minor has @xmath48 within a factor of two of @xmath57 .",
    "gmez - flechoso & martnez - delgado ( 2003 ) argue that their lower value for the @xmath53 is consistent with the values derived from the velocity dispersion if the maximum possible effect from radial anisotropy is taken into account .",
    "they also argue that the observed velocity dispersion `` could be inflated by the effects of the substructures in the main body '' or by departures from virial equilibrium due to the galactic tidal force .",
    "the numerical simulations of piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) show that , if the galactic tidal force causes a departure from virial equilibrium , then escaping stars produce a velocity gradient  an apparent rotation  along the projected major axis of the dsph .",
    "hargreaves  ( 1994 ) and armandroff , olszewski , & pryor ( 1995 ) both found a statistically significant velocity gradient , but along the minor axis instead of the major axis . subtracting the velocity gradient from the radial velocities",
    "does not reduce the measured velocity dispersion significantly .",
    "kroupa ( 1997 ) and klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) show that the velocity gradient is hidden if the tidal debris is aligned along the line of sight to the dsph .",
    "palma ( 2003 ) rule out this alignment because it would produce more broadening of the horizontal branch than they observe .",
    "thus , a departure from virial equilibrium can not explain the difference between the @xmath53 found by gmez - flechoso & martnez - delgado ( 2003 ) and those found using the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "olszewski  &  aaronson ( 1985 ) discovered a statistically significant change in surface density across their 3  arcmin  @xmath27  5  arcmin field and interpreted this variation as evidence for substructure in ursa minor .",
    "it is now known that the highest peak in the surface density of the dsph is near the eastern edge of this field .",
    "demers  ( 1995 ) also detect a statistically significant clump of stars at the same location , which causes a step in the surface density profile at a radius of about 1  arcmin .",
    "the deep _ hst _ photometry of battinelli  &  demers ( 1999 ) supports the existence of this clump and may also suggest the presence of additional structure within the clump .",
    "other studies of substructure have focused on a possible secondary peak or `` shoulder '' in the surface density profile , first noted by ih , that is about 15  arcmin northeast of the primary peak .",
    "kleyna  ( 1998 ) , eskridge & schweitzer ( 2001 ) , and palma  ( 2003 ) demonstrate that a `` shoulder '' in the profile is statistically significant , though a secondary peak is not .",
    "kleyna  ( 2003 ) used measured radial velocities for stars in ursa minor to demonstrate the presence of a distinct sub - population with a velocity dispersion of 0.5  km  s@xmath1  much smaller than the 8.8  km  s@xmath1 of the whole sample of velocities  at the location of the `` shoulder . ''",
    "excluding the stars in this substructure from the sample would increase the measured velocity dispersion of the dsph and , thus , the inferred @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the presence of substructure does not reconcile the @xmath53 found by gmez - flechoso & martnez - delgado ( 2003 ) with that derived from the velocity dispersion .",
    "two pictures of ursa minor emerge from the above discussion .",
    "( 1 ) dark matter is the main component of the mass of ursa minor and therefore it determines the structure and internal dynamics of the dsph .",
    "( 2 ) ursa minor contains little or no dark matter and therefore the galactic tidal force has had and continues to have an important effect on the structure and internal dynamics of the dsph . knowing the proper motion of ursa minor can help to discriminate between these two pictures by constraining the orbit and , thus , the strength of the galactic tidal force on ursa minor .",
    "if the perigalacticon is small , ursa minor would need to contain a large amount of dark matter to have survived until now .",
    "the presence of tidal signatures need not indicate that the dsph is out of virial equilibrium or that it contains only luminous matter .",
    "conversely , a large perigalacticon would require a low @xmath53 for the dsph so that the galactic tidal force could have produced the observed signatures .",
    "a proper motion for ursa minor also tests the hypothesis that it is a member of a `` stream '' of objects in the galactic halo that share a similar orbit .",
    "lynden - bell  &  lynden - bell ( 1995 ) propose that ursa minor , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , draco , and possibly also sculptor and carina , form a stream .",
    "they propose that such a stream forms from the fragments of a larger , tidally disrupted galaxy .",
    "the theory of streams in the galactic halo is falsifiable because it predicts a proper motion for each member of the stream .",
    "there is some controversy regarding the reality of this stream : anguita , loyola , & pedreros ( 2000 ) measured the proper motion of the lmc and found that it is inconsistent with the prediction of lynden - bell  &  lynden - bell ( 1995 ) , whereas the proper motions measured by jones , klemola , & lin ( 1994 ) and kroupa & bastian ( 1997 ) are consistent .",
    "there are two , independent , published results for the proper motion of ursa minor .",
    "scholz  &  irwin ( 1993 ) used palomar sky survey plates for the first and second epochs , which are separated by about 26 years , and plates taken with the tautenburg schmidt telescope for the third epoch  which provide a total time baseline of about 31  years .",
    "they find a proper motion , `` as is on the sky , '' of @xmath58  mas  cent@xmath1 ( the last row in their table  3 , but using an uncertainty 80 instead of 20  mas  cent@xmath1 for @xmath59 , as implied by the text ) .",
    "schweitzer ( 1996 ) and schweitzer , cudworth , & majewski ( 1997 ) used a total of 39 photographic plates taken with the palomar 5-meter hale telescope ( first epoch ) and the kpno 4-meter telescope ( second and third epochs ) .",
    "the time between the first- and third - epoch images is about 42 years .",
    "schweitzer ( 1996 ) reports a proper motion of @xmath60  mas  cent@xmath1 .",
    "the proper motions measured by these two studies agree within their uncertainties .    here",
    "we present a third independent measurement of the proper motion of ursa minor .",
    "the measurement derives from images of two distinct fields , each containing a known quasi - stellar object ( qso ) , taken with _ hst_. sections  [ data ] , [ analysis ] , and [ pm ] describe the data , the derivation of mean centroids at each epoch , and the derivation of the proper motion from the centroids , respectively .",
    "the last of these sections contains a comparison of our measured proper motion with those determined by scholz  &  irwin ( 1993 ) and schweitzer ( 1996 , see also schweitzer , cudworth , & majewski 1997 ) .",
    "section  [ orbitsec ]  derives orbital elements in a realistic potential for the milky way .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses the implications of the orbit of ursa minor for : 1 ) its membership in proposed structures in the galactic halo ; 2 ) its star formation history ; 3 ) the mass of the milky way ; and 4 ) the importance of the galactic tidal force and , thus , whether the dsph contains dark matter .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes our main results .",
    "the data comprise images of two distinct fields in the direction of ursa minor taken at three epochs with _ hst_. a known qso is at , or close to , the center of each field .",
    "the left panel in figure  [ fields ] shows the locations of the two fields on the sky .",
    "both fields are within the core radius and close to the minor axis . _ hst _ imaged the larger of the two fields , umi  j@xmath61 , on february 16 , 2000 ; february 15 , 2001 ; and february 1 , 2002 using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) with no filter ( 50ccd ) .",
    "ursa minor was in the continuous viewing zone during the first two epochs and was not during the last .",
    "each of the eight dither positions has six images at the first two epochs , for a total of 48 images per epoch , while each dither position has only three , for a total of 24 images , at the last epoch .",
    "the average exposure times for the three epochs are 176  s , 176  s , and 210  s , respectively .",
    "the qso in this field is at @xmath62 ( j2000.0 ) . from bellazzini  ( 2002 ) ,",
    "its @xmath18- and @xmath19-band magnitudes are 20.3 and 19.7 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : qso - stis ] shows a spectrum of the qso , which indicates a redshift of 1.216 .",
    "the top - right panel in figure  [ fields ] shows a sample image of this field from the 2000 epoch . the image is the average of six images at one dither position with cosmic rays removed .",
    "the cross - hair indicates the location of the qso .",
    "_ hst _ imaged the smaller of the two fields , umi  j@xmath63 , on march 14 , 1999 ; march 10 , 2001 ; and march 2 , 2003 using the planetary camera ( pc ) of the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the f606w filter .",
    "there are 40 images for the first epoch , 36 for the second , and 36 for the third .",
    "the exposure time is 160  s for each image . here , the qso is at @xmath64 ( j2000.0 ) , its @xmath18- and @xmath19-band magnitudes are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ( bellazzini  2002 ) , and figure  [ fig : qso - wfpc ] shows its spectrum .",
    "the spectrum implies a redshift of 0.716 .",
    "the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fields]depicts an average of three images in this field from the 1999 epoch , with cosmic rays removed .",
    "the cross - hair indicates the location of the qso .",
    "note the scarcity of stars in both sample images .",
    "bristow ( 2004 ) notes that the decreasing charge transfer efficiency in the stis and wfpc2 ccds may induce a spurious contribution to the proper motion measured with the method described by piatek  ( 2002 : p02 hereafter ) and piatek  ( 2003 ; p03 hereafter ) .",
    "the cosmic particle radiation damages the crystal lattice of a detector , creating `` charge traps , '' and the number of these traps increases with time . during the readout , charge moves along the @xmath67 axis : `` up , '' or towards the increasing @xmath67-values , for stis , and `` down , '' or in the direction of decreasing @xmath67-values , for pc2 .",
    "charge moves `` left , '' towards decreasing @xmath68-values in the serial register .",
    "when a `` packet '' of charge corresponding to some object encounters a trap , it loses some of its charge .",
    "a passing packet partially fills a trap , so a subsequent packet loses less charge .",
    "streaks of light along the @xmath68 and @xmath67 axes seen trailing behind objects in the images are the visual artefacts caused by the gradual release of charge from the traps .",
    "the loss of charge for motion in the @xmath68 direction is smaller than for that in the @xmath67 direction ; it is negligible for stis ( brown  2002 ) and one third as large for wfpc2 ( heyer  2004 ) .",
    "the subsequent discussion focuses only on the effect in the @xmath67 direction .",
    "the loss of charge to traps causes both the flux and the psf of an object to depend on its @xmath67 coordinate in the image .",
    "the farther a packet travels , the more charge it loses .",
    "hence , the measured flux of an object far from the serial register is smaller than that for an identical object closer to the serial register ; in other words , the measured flux becomes position dependent .",
    "this effect is immaterial to our method .",
    "however , as the packets representing an object move along the @xmath67 axis , those on its leading side fill partially each trap encountered , so that there are fewer traps available to remove charge from subsequent packets .",
    "this non - uniform loss of charge across the object changes its psf .",
    "consequently , the centroid of the packet shifts in the direction opposite to the readout direction .",
    "the shift is greatest for objects that are farthest from the serial register .",
    "it is also larger for faint objects than for bright objects ( bristow & alexov 2002 ) .",
    "this effect changes the measured proper motion only because the number of charge traps increases with time , thus causing the shift of a centroid to also change with time .",
    "the analysis of bristow ( 2004 ) warns that this spurious proper motion may be comparable to the actual proper motion of a dsph .",
    "there are two possible approaches to removing the effect of the spurious shifts of the centroids along the @xmath67 axis with time . in the first approach ,",
    "the images are corrected by restoring the trapped charge to its original packet .",
    "this correction requires that the distribution and the properties of the charge traps be known .",
    "bristow & alexov ( 2002 ) constructed a physical model of the charge traps and then wrote a computer code that makes the aforementioned correction for an image taken with stis . unless stated otherwise , the results presented are for corrected images .",
    "no comparable software exists for wfpc2 , unfortunately . a second approach to correcting for the decreasing charge transfer efficiency",
    "is including a term that varies linearly with @xmath67 in the equations which transform the coordinates of an object at different epochs to a common coordinate system .",
    "the coefficients of these transformations are fitted as described in section  [ sec : dpm ] .",
    "the analysis of the data taken with wfpc2 uses this approach .",
    "the analysis of the data and derivation of the proper motion of ursa minor are basically the same as those described in p02 .",
    "p03 provides some additional insight into the method .",
    "this article only lists the principal steps here and comments  where it is appropriate  on several changes in the details of the analysis .",
    "the principal steps of the analysis are : ( 1 ) using the daophot and allstar software packages ( stetson 1987 , 1992 , 1994 ) , determine an initial estimate of the centroid of each object  stars and the qso . ( 2 ) construct an effective point - spread function ( epsf ; anderson & king 2000 ) for each epoch separately from a select set of stars and the qso .",
    "( 3 ) iteratively , fit the epsf to an image of an object using least - squares to derive a more accurate centroid of the object and , using these more accurate centroids , derive a more accurate epsf . repeat until a stable solution ensues .",
    "there may be a maximum of @xmath56 centroids for an object , where @xmath56 is the number of images .",
    "( 4 ) transform the centroids measured at one epoch to a common  fiducial  coordinate system and calculate the average .",
    "the fiducial coordinate system for an epoch is the @xmath69 coordinate system of the chronologically first image .",
    "( 5 ) determine the transformation between the fiducial coordinate systems of the later epochs and that of the first epoch using stars which are likely members of ursa minor and common to all three epochs .",
    "the fit for the transformation simultaneously determines the change with time of the coordinates of some objects , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in pixel  yr@xmath1 .",
    "ideally , these objects are not members of ursa minor .",
    "the set of objects whose motion is fit is built starting with the qso and iteratively adding one object at a time , in order of descending @xmath72 for the scatter about the mean coordinate , until the highest @xmath72 of an object not yet in the set is below a specified limit .",
    "the shifts are with respect to stars of ursa minor which , by definition , have @xmath73 .",
    "this procedure for deriving the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for objects is new to our method ; section  [ pm ] below discusses its details .",
    "the advantage of this new method over that used by p02 and p03 is that it more accurately includes the contribution from the uncertainty in the coordinate transformation between epochs to the uncertainty in the proper motion .",
    "( 6 ) derive the proper motion of ursa minor from the @xmath70 and @xmath71 of the qso .    before calculating the transformation to the fiducial coordinate system ,",
    "the centroids measured in each image taken with wfpc2 are corrected for the 34th - row defect ( shaklan , sharman , & pravdo 1995 ; anderson & king 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , all centroids are corrected for the known optical distortions in the wfpc2 and stis instruments .",
    "this paper uses the most recent corrections for wfpc2 derived by anderson & king ( 2003 ) .",
    "the corrections for stis continue to be those in the stis data handbook ( brown  2002 ) .",
    "the following subsections present and discuss the key diagnostics of the performance of our method .",
    "equation  22 in p02 defines a flux residual diagnostic , @xmath74 , which is a quantitative measure of how the shape of an object matches the epsf . ignoring random noise , for a perfect match , @xmath75 ; otherwise , @xmath76 , where the sign depends on the details of the mismatch and the size of the mismatch increases with the brightness of the star . a plot of @xmath77 as a function of location can help unravel a dependence of true psf with location in an image .",
    "our method uses a single , location - independent epsf for deriving centroids of objects in all images for a given field and epoch .",
    "if the true psf of an object varies from image to image , then the @xmath77s for this object will show a scatter , for example around @xmath78 if the epsf represents some average of the true psfs .",
    "the plot of @xmath77 as a function of location will show trends if the true psf varies with location in the image .",
    "figure  [ rf - stis ] shows plots of @xmath77 as a function of location for the umi  j@xmath61 field .",
    "the left - hand panels show plots of @xmath77 _ versus _ @xmath68 and the right - hand panels show plots of @xmath77 _ versus _ @xmath67 . from top to bottom , the rows of plots are for epochs 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 .",
    "each plot combines points from all images for a given epoch .",

    "the @xmath77s for the qso become comparable to those for the stars when the value of the central pixel in the @xmath81 science data array for the qso ( see p02 for a description of the structure of the data ) is arbitrarily reduced by about 20% .",
    "thus , the psf of the qso is narrower than that of the stars , perhaps because the qso is bluer than the stars .",
    "( 2 ) the psf at a given location in the field varies from image to image , _",

    "this variation causes the scatter in the @xmath77s of a given object .",

    "for example , the object at @xmath82 is a star as bright as the qso but its @xmath77s tend to be less negative or even positive .",

    "p02 note that the @xmath96 scatter of measured centroids about their mean is smaller for measurements at a single dither position than for those at multiple dither positions .",
    "the interpretation of this was that the errors producing the additive uncertainty depend primarily on pixel phase , which argues that they arise from errors in the shape of the epsf .",
    "thus , the measurements of the centroid at a single dither position are not independent when the @xmath97 is high .",
    "both p02 and p03 calculate the larger uncertainty in the mean centroid resulting from the smaller number of independent measurements by assuming that , when the @xmath96 of a component of the centroid approaches the corresponding @xmath102 , the uncertainty in the average centroid approaches the @xmath96 divided by the square - root of the number of dither positions instead of the square - root of the number of measurements ( see equation  29 in p02 ) .",
    "additional testing while analyzing data for this article shows that the method of p02 and p03 overestimates the uncertainties in the centroids for those objects with high @xmath97 , while underestimating them for those with low @xmath97 .",
    "the usual estimator for the standard deviation about the mean is biased downwards when the sample size is small ( sclove 2004 ) .",
    "for example , the bias is a factor of 0.89 for a sample size of three .",
    "this partly explains why p02 finds a smaller @xmath96 scatter around the mean for measured centroids at a given dither position compared to the scatter for the centroids at all of the dither positions together . a better method to estimate the uncertainty in the final average centroid than that used by p02 , including the effects of a lack of independence of measurements at a given dither position , is to use the mean centroid , @xmath103 , at each dither position @xmath104 . the uncertainty in either the @xmath94 or @xmath105 component of the final centroid is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the number of dither positions and @xmath108 is the mean of the mean centroids at the dither positions",

    "the subsequent sections describe the actual realization of this procedure for the case of ursa minor .",

    "equation  [ eq : cti - stis ] is for the data taken with stis , whereas equation  [ eq : cti - pc ] is for those taken with wfpc2 .",
    "these equations are necessary only when the method of bristow & alexov ( 2002 ) has not been used to restore the images .",
    "because charge traps affect a faint object more than a bright object , an object contributes to the determination of the fitted parameter @xmath129 , and has its coordinates subsequently corrected , only if its @xmath97 is smaller than some specified limit .",

    "the procedure then iteratively selects the object with the largest contribution to the @xmath72 and fits for its @xmath118 together with all of the previously fit parameters .",
    "the iteration terminates when the highest @xmath72 among the objects not yet selected is smaller than some specified limit .",
    "the proper motion of a dsph derives from @xmath133 for the qso .",

    "the total @xmath116 from equation  [ eq : k2 ] is much larger than one per degree of freedom when using the uncertainties estimated with equation  [ eq : uncnew ] .",

    "the solid square marks the current location of the dsph , the solid star indicates the center of the galaxy , and the small open circles mark the points where @xmath171 or , in other words , where the orbit crosses the plane of the galactic disk .",

    "the latter comes from 1000 monte carlo experiments , where an experiment integrates the orbit using an initial velocity that is chosen randomly from a gaussian distribution whose mean and standard deviation are the best estimate of the space velocity and its quoted uncertainty , respectively .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit , defined as @xmath172 is 0.39 , though the 95% confidence interval ranges from a nearly circular orbit to a nearly radial orbit with a perigalacticon near 10  kpc .",

    "the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath174 , is measured counter - clockwise from the positive @xmath68-axis .",
    "as outlined in section  [ intro ] , ursa minor may be a member of a stream that also includes the lmc , smc , draco , and , possibly , sculptor and carina . if ursa minor is a member , then its predicted measured proper motion is @xmath175  mas  cent@xmath1 , or @xmath176  mas  cent@xmath1 with a position angle of 328  degrees ( lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 ) .",

    "we rule out the possibility that ursa minor is a member of the proposed stream at more than @xmath181 .",
    "kroupa , theis , & boily ( 2004 ) show that the 11 dwarf galaxies nearest to the milky way are nearly on a plane , whose pole is at @xmath182  degrees . adopting the direction of the angular momentum vector as the pole of the orbit ,",
    "then the location of the pole is @xmath183 because of the left - handed nature of the galactic rotation , prograde orbits have @xmath184 and retrograde orbits have @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the pole of our orbit for ursa minor is @xmath186  degrees , where the uncertainties are 1-@xmath99 values from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "thus , the motion of ursa minor is not in the plane defined by the nearby dwarf galaxies .      studies of the stellar population in ursa minor , described in section  [ intro ] , indicate that the dsph contains low - metallicity , old stars . the majority of stars formed close to a hubble time ago , suggesting that ursa minor lost its gas quickly .",
    "in contrast , carina had extensive star formation about 7  gyr ago , which continued to within 1  gyr ago .",
    "these two galaxies have nearly the same luminosity and surface brightness and , thus , presumably should have retained gas to a similar degree . since they have not , is it because their galactic orbits are different ?",
    "the answer appears to be no .",
    "table  4 of p03 shows that carina has orbital elements similar to those of ursa minor .",
    "the perigalacticon of carina is probably smaller than that of ursa minor ( a nominal value of 20  kpc _ versus _  40  kpc ) , so carina should have lost its gas more rapidly to stronger tidal shocks ( mayer  2001 ) and larger ram pressure stripping ( blitz & robishaw 2002 ; gallart  2001 ; mayer & wadsley 2003 ) . a notable difference between the two orbits is that that for carina is prograde , while that for ursa minor is retrograde .",
    "however , how this difference could have affected star formation is unclear .",
    "ursa minor is bound gravitationally to the milky way .",
    "the galactocentric space velocity of the dsph imposes a lower limit on the mass of the milky way within the present galactocentric radius of the dsph , @xmath31 . assuming a spherically symmetric mass distribution and zero for the total energy of the dsph , the lower limit for the mass of the milky way is given by @xmath187 setting @xmath188  kpc and using the values from table  4 for @xmath189 and @xmath190 , @xmath191 .",
    "this lower limit is consistent with other recent estimates of the mass of the milky way , such as the mass of @xmath192 within @xmath193  kpc found by sakamoto , chiba , & beers ( 2003 ) .",
    "the milky way potential adopted in section  [ orbitsec ] has a mass of @xmath194 out to @xmath188  kpc .",
    "the measured ellipticity of ursa minor is one of the largest known for the dsphs . if the galactic tidal force deformed ursa minor from an initial spherical shape to its present elongated shape , then the position angle of its projected major axis should be similar to the position angle of the galactic - rest - frame proper motion vector",
    "the position angle of the projected major axis is @xmath195  degrees and the position angle of the galactic - rest - frame proper motion vector is @xmath196  degrees .",
    "the difference between the two position angles is 2.6 times its uncertainty , arguing that ursa minor is not elongated along its orbit .",
    "gmez - flechoso & martnez - delgado ( 2003 ) derive an @xmath48 for ursa minor in the range 6 to 24 by matching the radial profile of a model dsph from n - body simulations to the observed radial profile . in the simulations , the dsph moves on the orbit found by schweitzer , cudworth , & majewski ( 1997 ) .",
    "given our different orbit for ursa minor , is this range of @xmath48 values still compatible with the observed limiting radius of the radial profile ?",

    "if @xmath204  arcmin , then 50% of the orbits in monte carlo simulations have @xmath205 .",

    "if @xmath206  arcmin , then 50% of the orbits have @xmath207 , and 95% have @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the @xmath48 derived by gmez - flechoso & martnez - delgado ( 2003 ) is incompatible with the larger measured value of @xmath206  arcmin for our measured proper motion for ursa minor . on the other hand ,",
    "any of the larger values for @xmath48 derived from the observed velocity dispersion ( see section  [ intro ] ) is more compatible with the larger value of @xmath203 .",
    "equation  [ eq : rtidal ]  shows that @xmath208 , so the values for @xmath53 derived using this equation are sensitive to the measured value of the limiting radius and the identification of that radius with the tidal radius . until kinematic measurements definitively identify the tidal radius , an @xmath53 derived with the above argument",
    "should be treated with caution .",
    "the average measured @xmath48 for galactic globular clusters is 2.3 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "could the @xmath48 of ursa minor be this low ?",
    "numerical simulations by oh , lin , & aarseth ( 1995 ) and piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) show that the ratio of the limiting radius derived by fitting a theoretical king model ( king 1966 ) , @xmath203 , to the tidal radius defined by equation  ( [ eq : rtidal ] ) is a useful indicator of the importance of the galactic tidal force on the structure of a dsph .",
    "these simulations show that : if @xmath209 , the galactic tidal force has little effect on the structure of the dsph ; at @xmath210 , the effect of the force increases rapidly with increasing @xmath211 ; and , for @xmath212 , the dsph disintegrates in a few orbits . assuming that @xmath213 and @xmath204  arcmin , @xmath214 for 59% of the orbits generated in monte carlo simulations . if @xmath206  arcmin , the fraction is 99.6% .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that ursa minor would have survived a hubble time on its current orbit if it did not contain any dark matter .",

    "\\2 ) removing the contributions of the motion of the sun and of the lsr to the measured proper motion , gives a galactic - rest - frame proper motion of @xmath216 mas  century@xmath1 in the equatorial coordinate system for an observer at the location of the sun but at rest with respect to the galactic center . in the galactic coordinate system , this motion is @xmath217 mas  century@xmath1 .",
    "\\4 ) the best estimate for the orbit shows that ursa minor is close to its apogalacticon of @xmath220 kpc and is moving closer to the milky way on a retrograde orbit with eccentricity @xmath221 and a smallest angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the galactic disk of @xmath222 .",
