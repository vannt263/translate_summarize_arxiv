    "enormously powerful events illuminate the universe that challenge our understanding of the cosmos . indeed ,",
    "intense electromagnetic emissions of order @xmath0  @xcite have been routinely observed in supernovae , gamma ray bursts  ( grbs ) , and active galactic nuclei  ( agns ) , for example . however , despite important theoretical and observational advances , we still lack a thorough understanding of these systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "intense observational and theoretical efforts are ongoing in order to unravel these fascinating phenomena .",
    "while the full details remain elusive , one of the natural ingredients in theoretical models is the inclusion of a rotating black hole which serves to convert binding and rotational energy of the system to electromagnetic radiation in a highly efficient manner .",
    "the starting point for these theoretical models can be traced back to ideas laid out by penrose  @xcite and blandford and znajek  ( bz )  @xcite , which explain the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole .",
    "these seminal studies , along with subsequent work ( see references in e.g.  @xcite ) , have provided a basic understanding of highly energetic emissions from single black hole systems interacting with their surroundings .",
    "recent work has indicated that related systems can also tap kinetic energy and lead to powerful jets  @xcite .",
    "this work concentrated on non - spinning black holes moving through a plasma and highlighted that relative black hole motion alone ( with respect to a stationary electromagnetic field topology at far distances from it ) can induce the production of jets .",
    "furthermore , subsequent work  @xcite demonstrated that even black holes with misaligned spins with respect to the asymptotic magnetic field direction induce strong emissions with power comparable to the aligned case .",
    "these studies suggested that , independent of their inclination , astrophysical jets might be powered by the efficient extraction of both rotational and translational kinetic energy of black holes , and inducing even more powerful jets than the standard bz mechanism would suggest .",
    "galactic mergers provide a likely scenario for the production of the binary black hole systems considered here  @xcite .",
    "in such a merger , the supermassive black holes associated with each galaxy will ultimately form a binary in the merged galaxy .",
    "a variety of interactions will tighten the black hole binary .",
    "eventually the dynamics of the system will be governed by gravitational radiation reaction which drives the binary to merge .",
    "the circumbinary disk will likely be magnetized and thereby anchor magnetic field lines , some of which will traverse the central region containing the binary .",
    "preliminary observational evidence for supermassive black hole binaries resulting from galactic mergers has already been presented  @xcite .",
    "an ambient magnetic field threading a spinning black hole populates a low density plasma surrounding the black hole as explained by bz  @xcite . even for black holes with no spin",
    ", it was recently shown that the orbiting binary interacting with the surrounding plasma can lead to a collimated poynting flux  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider this basic paradigm of energy extraction from black holes with the additional complexity of intrinsic black hole spin .",
    "binaries consisting of spinning black holes demonstrate similar , albeit energetically enhanced , phenomenology .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the dependence of the energy flux on the black hole velocity and highlight a resulting strong boost in the emitted power .",
    "in addition to exquisite and powerful electromagnetic detectors , soon gravitational waves will be added to the arsenal of phenomena employed to understand our cosmos .",
    "these studies suggest excellent prospects for the coincident detection of both electromagnetic and gravitational signals from binary black hole systems .",
    "certainly , dual detection of electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals would transform our understanding of these systems and lead to the refinement of theoretical models ( e.g  @xcite ) .    in the remainder of this paper , we elucidate the basic phenomenology arising from the interaction of binary black hole systems immersed within a plasma environment .",
    "we focus in particular on understanding the poynting flux emissions from such binaries as well as single , possibly spinning , black holes moving through plasma .",
    "we describe our equations and assumptions employed together with some of the details of our numerical implementation in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] .",
    "[ sec : results ] describes our results for both single and binary black holes and we provide concluding comments in sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the combined gravitational and electromagnetic systems that we consider consist of black hole spacetimes in which the black holes can be regarded as immersed in an external magnetic field .",
    "such fields , as mentioned above , will be anchored to a disk .",
    "we consider this disk to be outside our computational domain but its influence is realized through the imposition of suitable boundary conditions on the corresponding electric and magnetic fields on the boundaries of our domain  @xcite .",
    "with regard to the magnetosphere around the black holes , we assume that the energy density of the magnetic field dominates over its tenuous density such that the inertia of the plasma can be neglected .",
    "the magnetosphere is therefore treated within the force - free approximation  @xcite .",
    "we note that the contribution of the energy density of the plasma to the dynamics of the spacetime is negligible and we can ignore its back reaction on the spacetime .",
    "we use the bssn formulation  @xcite of the einstein equations and the force - free equations as described in  @xcite .",
    "we discretize the equations using finite difference techniques on a regular cartesian grid and use adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) to ensure that sufficient resolution is available where required in an efficient manner .",
    "we use the had  computational infrastructure , which provides distributed , berger - oliger style amr  @xcite with full sub - cycling in time , together with an improved treatment of artificial boundaries  @xcite .",
    "refinement regions are determined using truncation error estimation provided by a shadow hierarchy  @xcite , which adapts dynamically to ensure the estimated error is bounded by a pre - specified tolerance .",
    "typically our adopted values result in a grid hierarchy yielding a resolution such that @xmath1 grid points in each direction cover each black hole .",
    "we use a fourth order accurate spatial discretization and a third order accurate in time runge - kutta integration scheme  @xcite .",
    "we adopt a courant parameter of @xmath2 so that @xmath3 on each refinement level @xmath4 . in tests performed here for the coupled system ( and in our previous works for the force - free maxwell equations ) , the code demonstrates convergence while maintaining small constraint residuals for orbiting black holes .",
    "furthermore , we obtain for orbiting black hole evolutions agreemend with runs from other codes for the same initial data .    to extract physical information , we monitor the newman - penrose electromagnetic ( @xmath5 ) and gravitational ( @xmath6 ) radiative scalars @xcite .",
    "these scalars are computed by contracting the maxwell and the weyl tensors respectively , with a suitably defined null tetrad ( as discussed in  @xcite ) , @xmath7 and they allow us to account for the energy carried off by outgoing waves at infinity . the scalar @xmath5 ( essentially the radial component of the poynting vector ) provides a measure of the electromagnetic radiation at large distances from an isolated system . however , as the system studied here has a ubiquitous magnetic field , special care must be taken to compute the energy flux .",
    "we account for this difficulty by subtracting the scalar @xmath8 from @xmath5 .",
    "hence , from here forward , by @xmath5 we mean the difference @xmath9 .",
    "the luminosities in electromagnetic and gravitational waves are given by the integrals of the fluxes @xmath10    we assume that the black holes are immersed in an initially constant magnetic field , such as one produced by a distant disk surrounding the black hole system . for the binary systems we consider , the orbital plane of the evolution is assumed to be aligned with that of the circumbinary disk . the magnetic field is anchored in the disk with its associated magnetic dipole aligned with the orbital angular momentum ( chosen along the @xmath11 direction ) .",
    "initially , the magnetic field is set to be perpendicular to the velocity of the black holes and the electric field is set to zero . because the electromagnetic field is affected by the spacetime curvature , it will be dynamically distorted from its initial configuration and generate a transient burst of both gravitational and electromagnetic waves as it settles into a physically relevant and dynamical configuration .",
    "the initial magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath12 is chosen to be consistent with astrophysically relevant values  .",
    "we present our results for a field strength which is bounded by the the eddington magnetic field strength @xmath13  g  @xcite .",
    "as noted above , for these values the plasma s energy is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the gravitational field .",
    "thus , although the plasma is profoundly affected by the black holes , it has a negligible influence on their dynamics .",
    "here we discuss our results for both boosted and binary black hole systems . for simplicity",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath14  ergs / s and compute dimensionful quantities with respect to a representative system with total mass @xmath15 immersed in a magnetic field with strength @xmath16",
    "g. we explicitly provide proportionality factors for calculations for other configurations .",
    "quantities in geometric units are calculated by setting @xmath17 .",
    "+ _ single black holes _    for single , boosted black holes , we adopt a computational domain defined by @xmath18 ^ 3 $ ] and assume a fixed  bare \" mass of the black hole ( the mass it would have if it were static and in isolation ) of @xmath19 in geometric units .",
    "we set the initial linear momentum of the black hole to @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 an integer that we vary between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , and we set the intrinsic angular momentum parameter @xmath24 to be @xmath22 or @xmath25 . for these parameters we study the resulting electromagnetic collimated flux energy and its dependence on both boost velocity and black hole spin .",
    "[ fig : single_boost3d ] illustrates the qualitative features of the electromagnetic emission for a boosted black hole with and without spin . a collimated emission is clearly induced along the asymptotic magnetic field direction .",
    "significantly , an even stronger emission is obtained for the spinning case as expected .",

    "we present our results with respect to @xmath32 ( the measured _ coordinate velocity _ of the black hole ) and plot the collimated luminosity achieved once the system reaches a quasi - stationary state ( in other words , after the initial transient stage ) for the spinning and non - spinning cases in fig .",
    "[ fig : single_boost ] .",
    "several key observations are evident from the figure . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the electromagnetic energy luminosity does not vanish for the spinning black hole , while it does vanish for the non - spinning black hole .",
    "this is expected , as the spinning black hole interacts with a surrounding plasma and radiates by the blandford - znajek mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this luminosity results from the plasma s ability to extract rotational energy from the black hole and power a jet with an energy luminosity scaling as @xmath34  @xcite ( with @xmath35 the rotation frequency associated with the black hole ) .    for @xmath36 ,",
    "both the spinning and non - spinning black holes have a non - trivial associated energy flux . in the latter case",
    "this flux arises solely from the ability of the system to tap translational kinetic energy from the black hole , while the former results from the extraction of both translational and rotational kinetic energies .",
    "the non - spinning black hole shows the expected @xmath37 dependence in the electromagnetic energy luminosity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : single_boost ] ) consistent with the membrane picture of a black hole as a conductor . indeed , as was already indicated in the spinless case  @xcite , a black hole moving ( with speed @xmath32 ) through an ambient magnetic field acquires an induced charge separation ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the membrane paradigm  @xcite of a black hole explains this induced charge by regarding the black hole as a conductor moving through a magnetic field , and hence the induced charge is analogous to the classical hall effect . with this observation and the induction equation ,",
    "it is straightforward to conclude an electromagnetic energy flux will be produced with magnitude @xmath39 .",
    "such a quadratic dependence on speed is apparent in the figure .",
    "these results are also consistent with the work of  @xcite which studied the poynting flux associated with a moving conductor in a magnetized plasma , in particular the motion of artificial satellites in orbit .",
    "they found that this flux obeys @xmath40  @xcite where @xmath41 , the propagation speed of the modes , is the speed of light in a force - free environment .",
    "furthermore , a misalignment is expected between the collimated energy flux and the original magnetic field orientation such that @xmath42 . with the cautionary note",
    "that measuring this angle is a delicate enterprise within general relativity , especially in the strongly curved region around the black hole , such a relation is manifested in our results .",
    "for instance , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 the measured angle obeys @xmath45 instead of the predicted @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "+ the luminosity for the spinning black hole also demonstrates the same quadratic dependence in velocity , with the additional component from the spin .",
    "notice that the difference between the obtained luminosities in the spinning and spinless cases remains fairly constant for the different values of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , to a reasonably good approximation , we can express the luminosity obtained as a sum of a spin dependent component and a speed dependent one , @xmath47 , the latter scaling as @xmath48 .",
    "a fit to the case @xmath43 gives @xmath49 .",
    "next , using this value for the case @xmath50 , we obtain the fit for @xmath51 .",
    "we can then provide an estimate of the associated luminosity for general cases as follows .",
    "the spin component for the general case can be expressed in terms of its dependence on the the black hole spin as @xmath52 .",
    "the boost component takes the already mentioned quadratic form @xmath53 .",

    "this relationship , for example , would predict a luminosity for an @xmath57 , @xmath58 black hole to be @xmath59 .",
    "this phenomenology strongly suggests that the poynting flux can tap both rotational and translational kinetic energies from the black hole and that faster and more rapidly spinning black holes have a stronger associated power output . +     where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two constants .",
