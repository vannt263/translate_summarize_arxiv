    "in spite of the considerable progress made in the last decade in getting a clear picture of critical behavior and phase separation in systems dominated by coulombic interactions , ionic systems remain the subject of intense interest . for a symmetric 1:1 electrolyte system , for example , recent experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite strongly support three - dimensional ising - like criticality as the asymptotic behavior",
    ". one of the most basic and successful models of ionic fluids is the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , in which the ions are viewed as equisized hard spheres carrying positive and negative charges of the same magnitude . used for both theoretical and monte carlo simulations , the rpm model is able to characterize properly the vapor - liquid phase transition observed in electrolyte solutions  @xcite , as well the solid - liquid transitions of molten salts  @xcite .    in recent years , in order to understand better criticality in the rpm model , a lattice version of this model has been introduced  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the positions of the positive and negative ions are restricted to the sites of an underlying lattice with a spacing equal to the ionic diameter .",
    "the most striking feature of this model is the presence of an order - disorder transition , which is absent in the continuous version of the rpm .",
    "there is no gas - liquid transition and the coexistence is between a low - density disordered phase and an antiferromagnetically ordered high - density phase ; the transition is continuous ( nel - type line ) above and first - order below a tricritical point .",
    "by contrast , non - ionic fluids have the same critical behavior as the lattice ising model such that continuum and lattice models are essentially equivalent  @xcite .",
    "although the presence of an underlying lattice naturally favors the appearance of charge ordering , it is not completely obvious why the lattice and continuum models of rpm present such a different critical behavior .",
    "a possible explanation has been advanced by ciach and stell  @xcite using a formalism based on the landau - ginzburg - wilson approach .",
    "they proposed that in contrast to the uncharged systems with short - range interactions , where the long - wavelength fluctuations dominate and the lattice structure is irrelevant , in ionic systems the short - wavelength charge fluctuations are the most important . in this case , the short - distance properties of the system , such as the lattice structure or the shape of the short - range potentials added to the rpm model , become important and different phase diagrams can be obtained , i.e. there is no universality .",
    "in fact , ciach and stell have predicted that for a model system with additional short - range interactions added to the rpm model both gas - liquid and tricritical points can be thermodynamically stable . also , more recently  @xcite they proposed that when repulsive nearest neighbor interactions are included to the lattice rpm model , the phase diagram obtained should be qualitatively the same as in the continuum rpm model .",
    "these short - range interactions could represent the interaction between the ions and the particles of the solvent in which the ions are dissolved .    in this paper",
    "we extend the lattice rpm model for ionic systems introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a short - range attractive potential was supplemented to the lattice rpm .",
    "now , in addition to the hard - core and electrostatic interactions , some short - range repulsive interactions between the ions are included .",
    "we use grand canonical monte carlo simulations , combined with histogram reweighting  @xcite and mixed - field finite - size scaling  @xcite techniques , to obtain the coexistence curves and the associated critical points .",
