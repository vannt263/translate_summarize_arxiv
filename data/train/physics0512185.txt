    "solitons are among the most interesting structures in nature",
    ". being configurations of continuous fields they retain their localized shape even after interactions and collisions . observed originally long ago as stable moving humps in shallow water channels @xcite",
    "they have been established since then in various physical systems including optical waveguides , crystal lattices , josephson junctions , plasmas and spiral galaxies ( for an introduction see @xcite ) .",
    "long lasting efforts to theoretically describe their intriguing properties have culminated in the development of the inverse scattering technique @xcite which is among the most powerful methods to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "particularly popular examples for solitons in hydrodynamic systems are the solutions of the korteweg - de  vries equation ( kdv ) @xmath0 with @xmath1 standing for a space coordinate and @xmath2 denoting time . with @xmath3 representing the surface elevation of a liquid in a shallow duct this equation can be derived perturbatively from the euler equation for the motion of an incompressible and inviscid fluid @xcite .",
    "the one - soliton solution of ( [ eq : defkdv ] ) is given by @xmath4 which for all values of @xmath5 describes a hump of invariable shape moving to the right with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "the amplitude of the hump is given by @xmath7 whereas @xmath8 is a measure of its width .",
    "a decisive prerequisite to derive ( [ eq : defkdv ] ) is that to linear order in the field @xmath3 the system under consideration admits travelling waves @xmath9 with dispersion relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the phase velocity .",
    "intuitively the invariant shape of the soliton solution may then be understood as the consequence of a delicate balance between nonlinearity and dispersion at higher orders of both @xmath3 and @xmath12 @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate cylindrical solitons of kdv - type on the surface of a ferrofluid in the magnetic field of a current - conducting wire . in order to conserve the radial symmetry of the problem we neglect gravity",
    ". a possible experimental realization of to this situation is to surround the ferrofluid column with a non - magnetic fluid of the same density . in this case",
    "the hydrodynamics of this fluid has to be treated as well .",
    "ferrofluids are stable suspensions of ferromagnetic nano - particles in newtonian liquids and behave superparamagnetically in external magnetic fields @xcite . in the standard setup of a horizontal layer of ferrofluid subject to a homogeneous magnetic field",
    "an additional term proportional to @xmath13 shows up in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp0 ] ) @xcite which inhibits the derivation of a kdv equation in this geometry . on the other hand , for a ferrofluid cylinder in the magnetic field of a current - carrying wire the magnetic force may replace gravity and allows for dispersion free surface waves in the long wavelength limit .",
    "this in turn paves the way to derive a kdv equation for axis - symmetric surface deformations on the ferrofluid cylinder @xcite .    due to surface tension",
    "a long fluid cylinder is unstable to surface modulations resulting eventually in disconnected drops ( rayleigh - plateau instability ) .",
    "before embarking on the study of travelling waves on the fluid surface therefore means have to be found to suppress this instability .",
    "fortunately , this can also be accomplished with the help of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "an accurate experimental investigation of solitons in hydrodynamic systems is notoriously difficult due to the ubiquitous presence of dissipation .",
    "most quantitative studies have been devoted to hump solitons in shallow channels of water @xcite whereas recently also the detection of hole solitons on the surface of mercury have been reported @xcite . in our present setup either hole or hump solitary waves are possible depending on the value of the applied current .",
    "we therefore hope that the present theoretical work may also stimulate new experimental investigations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we collect the basic equations and boundary conditions .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a linear stability analysis of a cylinder of ferrofluid in the magnetic field of a current - carrying wire . here",
    "we demonstrate the possibility to suppress the rayleigh - plateau instability and establish the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp0 ] ) for axis - symmetric surface waves . in section 4",

    "<S> linear and non - linear surface waves on a ferrofluid cylinder surrounding a current - carrying wire are investigated . suppressing the rayleigh - plateau instability of the fluid column by the magnetic field of a sufficiently large current in the wire axis - symmetric surface deformations </S>",
    "<S> are shown to propagate without dispersion in the long wavelength limit . using multiple scale perturbation theory the weakly non - linear regime </S>",
    "<S> may be described by a korteweg - de  vries equation with coefficients depending on the magnetic field strength . for different values for the current in the wire hence different solutions such as hump or hole solitons </S>",
    "<S> may be generated . the possibility to observe these structures in experiments </S>",
    "<S> is also elucidated . </S>"
