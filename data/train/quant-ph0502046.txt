    "non - classical effects such as revivals and squeezing exhibited by quantum wave packets while propagating through different media are of great interest in the context of quantum information processing with continuous variables@xcite . both the nature of the medium in which the state propagates and the precise initial state considered play a crucial role in determining the subsequent dynamics of the state . with the experimental realization of several non - classical states in quantum optics@xcite , it has become important to examine more closely their dynamical properties .",
    "detailed investigations have been carried out , for instance , on the revival phenomena displayed by an initial coherent state evolving under different hamiltonians@xcite . in particular , the non - classical features displayed by a wave packet which is initially a coherent state while it propagates through a nonlinear , kerr - like medium have been examined .",
    "its squeezing and higher - order squeezing properties have been discussed@xcite , and signatures of wave packet revivals and fractional revivals have been shown to be captured in the expectation values of appropriate observables @xcite .    in this paper , we examine the effects of the _ departure _ from coherence of the initial state on the subsequent non - classical features it displays while evolving in a kerr - like medium . in order to be able to compare with exactitude these effects with those that arise in the dynamics of an initial coherent state ( cs ) , it is essential to consider such initial states as display a precisely quantifiable departure from coherence .",
    "the photon - added coherent states ( pacs ) are promising candidates for this purpose @xcite .",
    "we examine a spectrum of non - classical phenomena such as revivals , fractional revivals , squeezing and higher - order squeezing displayed by an initial pacs as it propagates in a kerr - like medium , and identify the effects arising from the departure from perfect coherence of the initial state .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we review briefly the salient features of revivals and fractional revivals of a wave packet , and identify quantifiers which provide signatures to distinguish between fractional revivals of initial wave packets that are ideal cs from those that are pacs . in section iii , we examine the dependence of squeezing and higher - order squeezing effects on the extent of coherence of the initial wave packet . in the final section ,",
    "we estimate the degree of non - classicality displayed by a cs and by a pacs at specific instants while evolving in a kerr - like medium , by quantifying the extent of negativity of the corresponding wigner functions .",
    "a wave packet propagating through a nonlinear medium may display revivals and fractional revivals at specific instants of time . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "if the initial wave packet @xmath0 is a superposition of a sufficient number of basis states , it is expected to revive at periodic intervals of time , though these intervals could be quite long in practice@xcite .",
    "a full revival at time @xmath1 is signaled by the fact that the autocorrelation function @xmath2 returns to its initial value of unity .    in a generic nonlinear medium , for wave packets which are peaked sufficiently sharply in energy about some eigenvalue labeled by @xmath3 , we may expand the energy spectrum @xmath4 in a taylor series about @xmath5 , and retain only terms up to the second order in @xmath6 .",
    "it can then be shown@xcite that fractional revivals of the wave packet occur at certain instants of time between successive revivals , when the wave packet splits into a superposition of a finite number of spatially separated sub - packets , each of which closely resembles the original one .",
    "this non - classical phenomenon arises due to very specific quantum interference properties between the basis states comprising the original wave packet@xcite .",

    "the positive constant @xmath11 represents the susceptibility of the nonlinear medium .",

    "full revivals of the wave packet can be discerned by observing the time evolution of the expectation values ( first moments ) of the operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while distinctive signatures of the @xmath23-sub - packet fractional revivals manifest themselves in the temporal behavior of the @xmath27 moments of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "similar behavior is displayed by @xmath47 .",
    "an explicit calculation reveals that , in general , the signature of a @xmath23-sub - packet fractional revival is mirrored in the dynamics of @xmath48 ( equivalently , of @xmath49 ) .",
    "it follows that the plot of @xmath50 ( the standard deviation in @xmath28 ) versus @xmath51 ( the standard deviation in @xmath29 ) captures the occurrence of a 2-sub - packet fractional revival .",
    "likewise , the square of the skewness in @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) mirrors the occurrence of a 3-sub - packet fractional revival , while the temporal behaviour of the kurtosis of @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) enables us to detect the appearance of a 4-sub - packet fractional revival .",
    "next , we turn to the case in which the initial state is a pacs rather than a ( perfectly coherent ) cs .",
