    "the nodes that remain in the stationary state are those which have @xmath0 or more neighbors of the same strategy and hence they belong to a percolating cluster of that strategy .",
    "we call @xmath78 and @xmath79 the probabilities that a node belongs to a percolating cluster assuming an _ independent _ percolation process with transitions @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . obviously , @xmath82 and @xmath83 . both probabilities can be calculated for infinite bethe lattices @xcite .",
    "they offer a rough approximation of the behavior of the model , assuming no interference between both processes , which yields the following prediction for the asymptotic density of b - individuals @xmath84    this approximation obviously fails to account for the change in the percolation probabilities that the simulation results reflect .",
    "therefore , we propose the following analytical theory , which takes into account the interplay between both competing percolation processes .",
    "let us first define a simplified version of the model , which we call the 1t - model .",
    "this model is the same as the original one , with the only difference that each node can only switch strategy once .",
    "that is , nodes change strategy according to eqs .",
    "( [ si : eq : switch - a])([si : eq : switch - b ] ) , but once they have changed , they stick to the new strategy , no matter what eqs .  ( [ si : eq : switch - a])([si : eq : switch - b ] ) dictate .",
    "note that this idea can be generalized to a @xmath85t - model , where each node is allowed to switch at most @xmath85 times .",
    "our original model could also be called @xmath86t - model , i.e.  when @xmath85 is unbounded .",
    "in fact , we can assume in the original model that most nodes will switch only once or never .",
    "for a node to switch , it is required that the number of neighbors of the same strategy is below a given threshold @xmath0 .",
    "once it has switched , it will have a number of neighbors of the ( new ) strategy larger than @xmath87 ( @xmath26 is the degree of the network ) , which usually means a large number of them .",
    "so it is reasonable to expect that the node will be locked in the new strategy forever , as it would require a large number of changes in its neighborhood to switch back .",
    "the great similarity between the simulation results of the original @xmath86t - model and the 1t - model supports this intuition ( see fig .  [",
    "si : fig:01][si : fig:04 ] ) .    the 1t - model can be exactly calculated for an infinite bethe lattice , with a recursive procedure that we present in the following . from now on , let us denote by @xmath88 one of the options , a or b , and by @xmath89 the other one , i.e.  @xmath89 is the only element of the set @xmath90 .",
    "the index of the percolation process with transitions @xmath91 is denoted @xmath92 .",
    "the fundamental recursive property of the 1t - model is that the time of switching of any @xmath88-node is @xmath93 ( the @xmath92-th greater time of switching among its @xmath88-neighbors ) .",
    "for example , with a percolation process for transitions @xmath94 with index @xmath95 , if a b - node has 6 neighbors that are all b - nodes and whose times of switching are @xmath96 2 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 7 , respectively , then the node will switch at time @xmath97 .",
    "notice that if an @xmath88-node belongs to a percolating cluster then its time of switching is unbounded , because it has @xmath92 or more neighbors that also have unbounded switching times .",
    "first , we calculate the switching probabilities of a node , conditioned to the event of being connected to a node of the same or the other type .",
    "thus , we define @xmath98 as the probability of a node being of type @xmath88 and switching at time @xmath65 , conditioned to the event of being connected to an @xmath88-node until time @xmath99 , with @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath101 as the probability of a node being of type @xmath88 and switching at time @xmath65 , conditioned to the event of being connected to a @xmath89-node , i.e.  of the opposite type , until time @xmath99 , with @xmath100 .",
    "second , we calculate the probabilities of a node being of type @xmath88 and switching at time @xmath65 , which we denote @xmath102 , given the conditional probabilities of switching of its child nodes until time @xmath99 , namely @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "third , in the stationary state @xmath88-nodes will be either nodes that have being @xmath88-nodes since the beginning or initial @xmath89-nodes that have switched option .",
    "hence the stationary density of b - nodes @xmath66 can be expressed as @xmath105    to calculate the probabilities @xmath106 we need to consider all the possible configurations of neighborhood of a node . to this end",
    ", we classify the neighbors at time @xmath65 into one of these types : + @xmath107 $ ] nodes of the same type that switch at time @xmath99 .",

    "+ @xmath112 $ ] nodes of the other type that switch at time @xmath99 or before .",
    "+ note that neighbors of type @xmath107 $ ] are the ones that trigger switching of the focal node at time @xmath65 . for a given configuration",
    ", the number of neighbors of each type appears as an exponent in the corresponding combinatorial expression . in eqs .",

    "the calculation proceeds according to the following eqs .",
    "( [ si : eq : calc - r1])([si : eq : calc - p ] )              as the probabilities of switching decay exponentially with time , it is enough to calculate a finite number of terms in the sums of eq .",
    "( [ si : eq : approx - ifc ] ) . for the results reported in this work 100 terms were used , which gives excellent agreement with the computer simulations ( see figs .",
    "[ si : fig:01][si : fig:04 ] ) .    notice that eqs .",
    "( [ si : eq : calc - rt])([si : eq : calc - s ] ) assume that nodes of the other strategy that have switched ( exponent @xmath85 ) have done so before or at the same time that those of the own strategy ( exponent @xmath0 ) .",
    "this simplification thus avoids considering the full set of possible histories of switchings in times previous to @xmath99 .",
    "this assumption is based on the separation of time scales between the switchings of both percolation processes .",
    "for unidirectional percolation , the probability of a node switching at time @xmath65 decreases exponentially with the difference between the initial density and the critical percolation density .",
    "that is , the nearer the systems starts to the percolation threshold the slower the pruning of nodes is @xcite . as a consequence , with bi - directional percolation ,",
    "when an option is near its percolation threshold the other is well beyond it , so the switching of the latter will be exponentially faster , which supports the assumption above .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the proposed recursive scheme on the switching times can be modified to carry out a calculation disregarding interference , thus equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ si : eq : approx - no - ifc ] ) .",
    "the modification consists in setting @xmath131 , for any @xmath100 , instead of eqs .",

    "these figures show the close similarity between the original model and the 1t - model , which confirms that most nodes that switch in the original model do so only once .",
    "they also demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed approximation , as compared to the calculation neglecting interference , which fails to reflect the actual percolation thresholds properly .",
    "figures  [ si : fig:03 ] and  [ si : fig:04 ] display two additional examples .    finally , we want to point out that , strictly speaking , the networks considered in the analytical calculations ( namely , infinite bethe lattices ) differ from the ones used in the computer simulations ( finite regular random networks ) .",

    "<S> the underlying switching dynamics is therefore assumed to be _ </S>",
    "<S> unidirectional_.    here we introduce a percolation model that generalizes this powerful theoretical approach . </S>",
    "<S> our extension assumes that nodes are of two types a or b , and that a node changes type when the number of neighbors of the same type is less than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently both changes a - to - b and b - to - a are possible , i.e.  we are considering a _ bi - directional _ percolation dynamics instead . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 provides an example which illustrates the fundamental difference between both percolation processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem we want to address is the competition between innovations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> competition between products , tools or technical standards is ubiquitous . </S>",
    "<S> well - known examples are railway gauges , keyboard layouts , computer operating systems , high - definition video standards , e - book readers , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons that determine the outcome of these fierce competitions have puzzled researchers of different disciplines for a long time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous work has highlighted the combined influence of intrinsic benefits of each option together with costs incurred due to switching @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been suggested that social structure , i.e.  the network of social relationships in a group or population , would play a crucial role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , however , there has been little analytical work that elucidates the outcome of such competitions . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that the competition between innovations can be understood as a bi - directional percolation process , which ultimately determines the fate of the options in contest .    to start with , let us consider a simple model with two competing options , a and b ( for example blu - ray disc vs hd dvd ) , whose benefits to individuals depend on intrinsic factors as well as on the acceptance by others in a certain social neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> this can be modeled as a coordination problem @xcite , in which individuals choosing one of the two options a or b obtain a payoff @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the relative advantage of one option over the other is represented by the parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 give , respectively , the proportion of people adhering to option a or b among the social acquaintances who have an influence on the individual s decision , such us family members , friends , co - workers , etc ( @xmath9 for every individual ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we consider that changing option entails some switching cost , which is called @xmath10 for a follower of option a who changes to b , and @xmath11 in the opposite case . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a- and b - individuals have the following effective payoff matrices @xmath12 where we follow the standard convention for symmetric games : rows represent own strategy and columns that of the interaction partner .    for the moment </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that individuals are able to assess to a good extent the benefits and drawbacks of options a and b , and also the degree of penetration of each option in their social neighborhood , i.e.  we assume a low level of uncertainty in the decision - making process ( more on this important point later ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , individuals choose a best response to the current state of their social context according to the payoffs expected from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : payoffs ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , a - individuals change to option b if the proportion of a - neighbors is below a certain threshold , namely @xmath13 , while b - individuals switch if the proportion of b - neighbors is less than certain value , @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> this defines an evolutionary game @xcite , which consists in a dynamical system with state variable @xmath15 , the global density of the followers of one of the options . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath16 without loss of generality . disregarding the effect of social structure for the moment </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of @xmath17 can easily be calculated assuming a well - mixed population @xcite , equivalent to the mean field hypothesis in physics or the representative agent in economics . </S>",
    "<S> it posits that every individual has , in her social neighborhood , a proportion of a- or b - individuals equal to the respective global densities , i.e.  for every individual and at any time @xmath18 . under this assumption </S>",
    "<S> , the population rapidly reaches an equilibrium with stationary value @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the initial density of individuals following option b. equation  ( [ eq : well - mixed ] ) shows that under well - mixed conditions switching costs induce the appearance of a heterogeneous state , in which both competing options keep a share of the population . </S>",
    "<S> if costs are left out ( @xmath22 ) , then we find the standard solution of a coordination game , with an unstable equilibrium at @xmath23 , which separates the basins of attraction of the stable equilibria @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider this model embedded in a social network @xcite , that is , in a network of social relationships which determines who interacts with whom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we use regular random networks @xcite , which are networks where nodes are linked at random and where each node has the same number of neighbors , or degree , @xmath26 . such networks are known to have the most neutral effect on evolutionary games @xcite , just fixing neighborhood size and preserving the social context of individuals . </S>",
    "<S> they avoid particular effects that some topological features , such as clustering or degree heterogeneity , may have @xcite , which could obscure the processes we want to reveal here .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:02 ] displays simulation results for this model , showing the stationary density of b - individuals @xmath27 as a function of their initial density @xmath21 ( see the materials and methods section for full details about the simulations ) . </S>",
    "<S> notably , there are large differences to mean field theory , which predicts a heterogeneous population for a much wider range of initial conditions . in order to understand this deviation we have to consider the time evolution of the model . to that purpose , it is better to start with a simpler case , setting one of the switching costs with so large a value that it prevents the switching of individuals following that strategy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , let us set @xmath28 , so that only b - individuals can change to option a. this switching takes place when the proportion of b - individuals in the neighborhood of the focal individual satisfies @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the subsequent dynamics exactly coincides with the pruning of nodes of a standard site percolation process with unidirectional dynamics ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:01 ] ) , a- and b - individuals corresponding to empty and occupied nodes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when b - nodes become a - nodes , they leave other b - nodes with fewer b - neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> the process repeats until it stabilizes to a subset of b - nodes , all of which have @xmath29 or more b - neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> when the size of this subset is a non - negligible fraction of the size of the full graph , or infinite in the case of infinite graphs , then percolation is said to occur @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of a percolating cluster constitutes a phase transition , and it takes place when the initial density of occupied nodes is larger than a critical density . in our case , the index of the percolation process of b - individuals switching to option a , called @xmath30 , is given by @xmath31 herein , @xmath32 denotes the smallest integer equal or larger than @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , considering only the transitions of a - individuals to option b , we have _ another _ percolation process with index @xmath33 , whose value is given by @xmath34 note that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are degenerate cases , whereas @xmath1 is the index of standard percolation and @xmath2 corresponds to bootstrap or @xmath0-core percolation .    the actual dynamics of our model is given by the competition between these two percolation processes . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is therefore bi - directional , with both transitions a - to - b and b - to - a taking place simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation based on standard unidirectional percolation , applied to each process separately , estimates the percolation thresholds only poorly , as the arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:02 ] show . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible , however , to take into account the interference between both processes , with a recursive calculation on the switching times of individuals . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:02 ] shows the excellent agreement of this calculation with the computer simulations , and it clearly demonstrates that mutual interference between both percolation processes occurs . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that this interplay supports the success of the dominated option , i.e.  it allows some individuals following the minor option to percolate with initial conditions for which unidirectional percolation does not occur ( range @xmath37 for option b , and range @xmath38 for option a ) . </S>",
    "<S> individuals who have switched obviously promote percolation of the newly acquired option , as the switching increases the density of that option in the neighborhoods of adjacent nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale of switching for the major option is much faster than for the minor one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the pruning of nodes for the major option is virtually done by the time the pruning of the minor option proceeds , with the consequence that only changes of major to minor option have time to effectively foster percolation of the latter option . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , this analytical theory confirms that the competition between options a and b gives rise to a bi - directional percolation process , which allows a simple rationale for the outcome : _ in the context of competing innovations , percolation of an option means survival and , as long as it is the only one that percolates , it also implies dominance of the market . _ </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to supporting information for details of the analytical calculations and further discussion .    </S>",
    "<S> the joint influence of switching costs and social networks becomes most salient when one of the options is intrinsically superior to the other , i.e.  when @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:03 ] shows an example , displaying again the asymptotic density of b - individuals @xmath27 as a function of their initial density @xmath21 ( see solid line and black squares ) . in this case , the asymmetry of the game results in different percolation indices for each option , namely @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : kb])([eq : ka ] ) ) , which causes a continuous transition towards an a - dominated population ( @xmath42 ) , but a discontinuous one in the b - dominated case ( @xmath43 ) . the difference between both transitions @xcite originates from the characteristic transition of standard percolation , in the former case , versus that of bootstrap percolation , in the latter . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the net effect of this imbalance between the two competing percolation processes is a fostering of the superior option b. note that if the same game , with or without switching costs , took place on a well - mixed population , a symmetric outcome around @xmath44 would result instead ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : well - mixed ] ) and dashed red line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:03 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally address the issue of uncertainty or noise in the decision rule of individuals . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that individuals choose options stochastically , with a probability that follows a multi - nomial logit model @xcite , which is also known in physics as fermi rule @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if the expected variation in payoff resulting from a change of option is @xmath45 , then the probability of switching strategy is assumed to be @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath47 determines the amount of noise in the decision process . in the limit @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> , noise disappears and we have the deterministic dynamics used so far . </S>",
    "<S> additional curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:03 ] display the influence of noise , showing that the qualitative behavior of the model remains the same for low to moderate amounts of noise . </S>",
    "<S> it is striking , however , that the evolution of the population is biased towards the superior option b , i.e.  noise reinforces the imbalance between options rather than washing it out .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the competition between several options gives rise to bi - directional ( or , more generally , multi - directional ) percolation processes which can be analytically understood . </S>",
    "<S> multi - percolation thus provides a powerful theoretical tool to understand the problem of competition between innovations in networks . </S>",
    "<S> it offers predictions about the survival and dominance of the options in contest , as well as insights into their dynamical evolution in time . </S>",
    "<S> our general finding is that percolation of an option implies its survival and , if only one option percolates , it will be eventually supported by everyone . the latter may be favorable , for example when it promotes a shared technical standard . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it could also create monopolies or endanger pluralism . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions are expected to be also relevant to the results of marketing and political campaigns , and to the diffusion of opinions @xcite and behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> model variants or extensions may also describe the spread of health behavior , such as obesity , smoking , depression or happiness @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recognize that the practical applicability of this theory requires a good knowledge of the social network and a sound modeling of the decision making process of individuals @xcite , but with the emergent availability of massive social data and information technologies , we envisage that this goal will be attainable soon . </S>"
