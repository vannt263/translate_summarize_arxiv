    "in hadronic atoms , nature has provided a relatively clean environment in which to explore the low - energy interactions of charged hadrons .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction allows for oppositely - charged , long - lived hadrons to form coulomb bound states .",
    "the locations of the energy - levels of these systems are perturbed by the strong interactions , while the lifetimes of the ground states are dictated by the strong interactions that couple the charged hadrons to lighter neutral ones .    theoretically , the simplest hadronic atom to understand is composed of two pions : @xmath10 .",
    "precision experiments have been performed and are ongoing to measure the lifetimes and energy - levels of such atoms  @xcite . in the isospin limit ,",
    "bose statistics dictates that two pions interacting in an s - wave can be in either an isospin-0 or isospin-2 state . by measuring the decay width and energy levels of pionium , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 strong - interaction scattering lengths can be isolated . while the difference between energy levels , and hence deviations from the coulomb spectrum , are relatively straightforward to measure , it is somewhat more challenging to determine the lifetime of these atoms .",
    "recently , the dirac collaboration  @xcite at cern has measured the lifetime to be @xmath13 , with the dominant decay mode being @xmath14 . on the theoretical side ,",
    "progress in lattice qcd has been quite rapid , with a recent fully - dynamical calculation of the @xmath12 @xmath15 scattering length at pion masses between @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "when combined with two - flavor chiral perturbation theory , a prediction of the scattering length at the physical point is found to have an uncertainty that is somewhat smaller than that from experiment .",
    "an up - to - date discussion of the status of @xmath15-interactions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    studying the low - energy interactions between kaons and pions with @xmath18 bound - states allows for an explicit exploration of the three - flavor structure of low - energy hadronic interactions , an aspect that is not directly probed in @xmath15 scattering .",
    "experiments have been proposed by the dirac collaboration  @xcite to study @xmath5 atoms at cern , j - parc and gsi , the results of which would provide direct measurements or constraints on combinations of the scattering lengths . in the isospin limit",
    ", there are two isospin channels available to the @xmath5 system , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the width of a @xmath18 atom depends upon the difference between scattering lengths in the two channels , @xmath21 , ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the @xmath19 and @xmath20 scattering lengths , respectively ) while the shift of the ground - state depends upon a different combination , @xmath24 .",

    "in addition , three - flavor chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath28pt ) has been used to predict these scattering lengths out to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the chiral expansion . at nlo",

    "one must be cautious in assessing the uncertainties in these theoretical calculations , as one can only make estimates based on power - counting for the contribution of higher - order terms in the chiral expansion",
    ". there has been one determination of the @xmath33 scattering length in quenched qcd  @xcite , however the chiral extrapolation was restricted to tree level .",
    "it is worth mentioning a novel motivation for accurate determinations of meson - meson scattering from lattice qcd calculations .",
    "recent work has identified in a model - independent way the lowest - lying resonance in qcd which appears in @xmath15 scattering  @xcite .",
    "crucial to this development has been the accurate determination of the low - energy @xmath15 scattering amplitude , including the recent lattice qcd determination of the @xmath12 scattering length  @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis has very recently been carried out for @xmath5 scattering in the @xmath34 s - wave in order to determine the lowest - lying strange resonance  @xcite . improved accuracy in the low - energy @xmath5 scattering amplitude",
    "should be welcome to this endeavor .    in this work we present the results of a fully - dynamical lattice qcd calculation of @xmath0 scattering .",
    "by calculating the @xmath35 and @xmath36 dependence of the @xmath0 ( @xmath20 ) scattering length , we are able to provide a determination of both the @xmath20 and @xmath19 scattering lengths at the physical point .",
    "we have performed a hybrid mixed - action calculation with domain - wall valence quarks tuned to the staggered sea - quark masses of the milc configurations . as the computer resources do not presently exist to perform such calculations at or",
    "very near the physical value of the light - quark masses , these are performed at pion masses between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "naively one would expect that @xmath0 scattering would give information about @xmath8 scattering only .",
    "however , the lattice data , when combined with chiral perturbation theory , implies a constraint on @xmath9 scattering as well . we anticipate that with improved statistics , together with calculations on lattices with smaller lattice spacings , the theoretically - predicted regions for @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be further reduced beyond those shown in fig .
