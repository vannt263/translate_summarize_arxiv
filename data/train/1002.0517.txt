    "a striking property of _ confined _ active liquid crystals is the instability of the uniform aligned homogeneous state and the onset of spontaneously flowing states , both stationary and oscillatory  @xcite .",

    "an important new result of our work is the role of the _ shape _ of the active particles in controlling the rheological behavior .",
