    "in this work we investigate the distributions of gamma - ray photon flux and photon index for the largest flux - limited gamma - ray sample of blazars available at the moment , that of the third extragalactic source catalog of the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) ( 3lac  * ? ? ?",
    "most of the extragalactic objects observed by the large lat on the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope are classified as blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in which the jet is pointing toward us ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . characterizing the intensity and spectral characteristics of the gamma - ray emission seen in blazars",
    "is an essential for understanding of the physics of the accretion disk and black hole systems in agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the characteristics of blazars is also crucial for evaluating their contribution to the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) radiation .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat source catalogs are based on observations extending down to gamma - ray energies of 100 mev .",
    "although the 3lac reports the photon fluxes in the range from 1 to 100 gev , the photon flux in the range from 100 mev to 100 gev is an important quantity for blazars because the most photons are at the lower energies of this range , as are the most photons of the egb .",
    "therefore , we base this analysis on the full 100 mev to 100 gev photon flux , reconstructed as described in  [ datasec ] .",
    "if the whole 100 mev to 100 gev information is used , the threshold flux for detection depends strongly on an object s gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "this arises from the energy dependence of the point spread function @xcite and is such that harder spectra are detected at lower fluxes .",
    "thus , for determination of the flux distribution one needs to take into account both the flux and the photon spectral index , and that one then deals with a bi - variate distribution of fluxes and indexes , which is truncated because of the above mentioned observational bias . because the flux detection threshold depends on the photon index , the observed raw distributions do not provide the true log@xmath0-log@xmath1 counts or the true distribution of the photon index .",
    "thus a bias free determination of the distributions is more complicated than just counting sources .",
    "here we use non - parametric methods to determine the distributions directly from the data at hand .",
    "other methods such as monte carlo have been used , such as in @xcite  hereafter ma , and , for example , with redshift information and suitable assumptions the distribution of photon index can be corrected for the bias towards hard spectrum sources as in @xcite .    in a previous work ( @xcite  hereafter bp1 ) we demonstrated the techniques with real and simulated blazar flux and photon index data from the first year _",

    "as explored by e.g. petrosian ( 1992 ) , when dealing with a bi-(or more generally multi)-variate distribution , one must determine the correlation ( or statistical dependence ) between the variables , which can not be done by simple procedures when the data are truncated .",
    "we use a method based on the techniques first developed by efron and petrosian ( ep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which determine the intrinsic correlations ( if any ) between the variables and then the mono - variate distribution of each variable , accounting for the truncations of the data .",
    "these techniques have been proven useful for application to many sources with varied characteristics and most recently to the gamma - ray flux and photon index of blazars in bp1 and to radio and optical luminosity in quasars in @xcite , where a more thorough discussion and references to earlier works are presented .",
    "in @xcite we used the spectroscopic redshift information provided for the complete sample of 1lac flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) type blazars to determine the gamma - ray luminosity function , its evolution , and the density evolution for fsrqs .",
    "a very similar sample was used with different analysis techniques in @xcite to obtain the gamma - ray luminosity function and evolution for fsrqs , and a 1lac - based sample with a combination of measured redshifts and upper and lower limits was used to do the same with bl lacs in @xcite . however , in the case of 3lac blazars , the spectroscopic redshift information is incomplete , leading to the utility of this work recovering the intrinsic flux and photon index distributions using the maximal number of well characterized gamma - ray detected blazars of any type .    in this paper",

    "it is seen that there is a selection bias against soft spectrum sources at fluxes below @xmath5 photons @xmath6 sec@xmath7 .",
    "we also show for a selection of sources ( but only a few for clarity ) the approximate limiting flux for that source  that is the lowest flux it could have and still be sufficiently bright to be included in the sample given its location on the sky given the reported detection significance . the location of the line used for the truncation boundary is also shown .",

    "this set of criteria , which has been adopted by the lat team for certain analyses of the blazar population ( e.g. ma ) , includes those sources that are fully calibrated , removes spurious sources , and maximizes the likelihood of sources being properly identified as to spectral type .",
    "the test statistic is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the likelihoods of the background ( null hypothesis ) and the hypothesis being tested ( e.g. , source plus background ) .",

    "these include 286 which are identified as fsrq type , 352 which are identified as bl lacertae ( bl lac ) type , and 136 which have uncertain type .",
    "this can be compared to the 1lac with 352 @xmath8 and @xmath9 blazars , of which 161 are fsrqs , 163 are bl lacs , and 28 which are identified as uncertain type . thus the dataset used in this analysis contains more than twice as many blazars as that used in the previous analyses of bp1 and ma .",

    "the reported photon index ranges from 1.438 to 3.100 .",
    "it should be noted that some blazars manifest a photon flux as a function of photon energy in the range from 100 mev to 100 gev that can not be completely described by a single power law , showing curvature in the spectrum or other features .",
    "however , the 3lac does report a best - fit power law index for every blazar , and this analysis uses that power law .",
    "we recover @xmath14 from the reported flux density ( @xmath21 ) , pivot energy ( @xmath22 ) , and photon index with    @xmath23    @xmath14 is the blazar gamma - ray flux measure adopted in e.g. @xcite and is useful for exploring blazars and their relationship to the egb as discussed in  [ intro ] .",
    "we obtain the flux density and the pivot energy for 3lac blazars from the corresponding general _ fermi _ source catalog @xcite .",
    "the bias mentioned above is clearly evident ; there is a strong selection against soft spectrum sources at fluxes below @xmath24 photons @xmath6 sec@xmath7 .",
    "every blazar has an associated @xmath25 as discussed above , with the background flux being a function of position on the sky @xcite . in figure [ lumsandsis ]",
    "we also show the approximate limiting flux of some ( only some to avoid visual confusion ) of the blazars , which is an estimate of the lowest flux it could have to be included in the sample , given by @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath27 will thus have some dependence on the object s photon index and position on the sky . however , as discussed in bp1 , since there is some uncertainty in the detection threshold values of fluxes and indexes , the limiting flux as determined in this way is not the optimal estimate .",
    "we therefore use a more conservative truncation as shown by the straight line in figure [ lumsandsis ] . as verified with the simulated data discussed in bp1 , moving the truncation line to the right and",
    "down eliminates more sources in the edges of the sample , and does not change the results but increases the uncertainty , while moving it to the left changes the results .",

    "if in this case @xmath14 and @xmath17 are independent , the combined distribution @xmath32 can be separated into two independent distributions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , they may not be independent even though flux clearly depends strongly on redshift while photon index may not , and in fact does not in the case of fsrqs @xcite . correlations between flux and photon index are observed for example in gamma - ray bursts @xcite",
    ". there may also be an observed correlation induced by the selection biases , as there certainly is in this case as can be seen in figure [ lumsandsis ] , which should be removed in order to obtain bias free distributions of the variables .",
    "thus , the first task is to establish whether the variables are independent .    while the flux and photon index exhibit a strong correlation in the raw ( and heavily biased ) data , determining the intrinsic correlation when the data are truncated requires statistical methods to account for the missing data . in bp1",
    "we discuss in detail the methods we apply to the bi - variate _",
    "fermi_-lat observational blazar data .",
    "we use a technique first explored by efron and petrosian @xcite to determine whether the two variables are correlated .",
    "this method utilizes a modified version of the kendall tau test with the test statistic    @xmath35    to quantify the independence of two variables in a dataset , say ( @xmath36 ) for @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the dependent variable ( @xmath39 ) rank of the data point @xmath40 in a set associated with it . for untruncated data ( i.e. data truncated parallel to the axes ) the set associated with point @xmath40",
    "includes all of the points with a lower ( or higher ) independent variable value ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "if ( @xmath36 ) are uncorrelated then the ranks of all of the points @xmath38 in the dependent variable within their associated set should be distributed uniformly between 0 and the number of points @xmath43 , with the rank uncorrelated with their independent variable value , with the expectation value @xmath44 and variance and @xmath45 , where @xmath43 is the number of objects in object @xmath40 s associated set .",
    "then the points contributions to @xmath46 will tend to sum to zero . on the other hand , if the indepenent and dependent variables are correlated , then the rank of a point in the dependent variable will be correlated with its independent variable , and because the set to be ranked against consists of points with a lower independent variable value , the contributions to @xmath46 will not sum to zero .",
    "independence of the variables is rejected at the @xmath47 level if @xmath48 , and this can be considered the same standard deviation as would be calculated from another method such as least - squares fitting , as discussed in @xcite . if the variables are not independent , to find the best fit correlation the @xmath39 data are then adjusted by defining some new dependent variable @xmath49 and the rank test is repeated , with different values of parameters of the function @xmath50 .    to determine the intrinsic correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath17 we use a function which is a simple coordinate rotation , defining a new variable we call the `` correlation reduced photon index '' as    @xmath51",

    "this is not surprising , as there is some evidence of an inverse correlation between blazar luminosity and photon index @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we found no evidence of significant evolution of photon index with redshift for the case of fsrqs , so the result of a possible negative correlation seen here between photon index and flux would indicate that the ( small ) intrinsic correlation is actually indeed between photon index and luminosity .",

    "fermi_-lat bandwidth is sufficiently large that the contribution of sources which peak outside of this range to the source counts and the egb in this energy range will be small .",
    "a limitation of these results is the use of the reported best - fit power - law photon index for each blazar , even though some , or perhaps most , sources actually deviate from a strict power law in the relation between photon flux and photon energy . according to @xcite a total of 91 fsrqs , 32 bl lacs , and 8 blazars of unknown type in the 3lac show significant curvature in their spectra .",
    "as shown in that paper it is overwhelmingly the highest @xmath25 ( and therefore generally higher flux ) blazars which have been shown to have significant curvature away from a true power law in this relationship .",
    "spectral curvature could be a property of the higher flux blazars , or possibly more likely it is a general feature of blazars which has been most readily observable in those blazars with the highest ts .",
    "if the former is the case , then the effect on the truncation and issues related to the truncation would be minimal no matter how the truncation is dealt with . however , even in the case of the later , since this analysis relies on an empirical curve to approximate the truncation in the reported f@xmath102,@xmath17 plane as discussed in",
    " [ corrs ] , the analysis itself should not be particularly sensitive to deviations from a strict power law . however , to the extent that power laws are not representative of the true spectral properties of bright blazars in the energy range from 100 mev to 100 gev , that will be the case in these results and the distributions of photon index must be understood to be distributions of the _ best fit _ power law photon index . as stated in @xcite , `` although some spectra display significant curvatures , the photon index obtained by fitting single power - paw models over the whole lat energy range provides a convenient means to study the spectral hardness . ''    in  3.2 of bp1 we consider the uncertainties and errors present in this analysis resulting from individual measurement uncertainties , blazar variability , and source confusion . we conclude that the errors and uncertainties introduced from each of these effects are small compared to the dominant source of uncertainty in this analysis , which is that arising from the range of the correlation parameter @xmath28 which propagates through every other determination . as we argue in bp1 , to the extent that faint blazars are more likely to be observed by instruments such as the _",
    "fermi_-lat if they are in the flaring state rather than the quiescent state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the observed blazars should have a different mean photon index than the egb , were the egb to be made primarily from quiescent state blazars , under the assumption that blazars in the flaring state have a different spectrum than in the quiescent state . as the reconstructed",
    "mean photon index here ( and elsewhere ) of the _ fermi_-lat observed population is close to ( although not exactly ) that of the egb , and there is only a weak relation and correlation between flux and photon index , this would imply that at least one of the following must be the case : a ) there is not a significant bias in the _",
    "fermi_-lat toward detecting blazars in the flaring state , b ) quiescent blazars do not form the bulk of the egb , or c ) flaring and quiescent blazars have , en masse , roughly the same photon index distributions .",
    "we find that the photon index and flux show a slight negative correlation .",
    "this correlation is greater than 1@xmath29 significance for all blazars , and is quite significant in the case of the fsrq sub - population .",
    "this correlation likely results from an underlying correlation between photon index and luminosity , as discussed in  [ corrs ] . viewing the flux and photon index distributions ,",
    "the comparison of the intrinsic and raw observed distributions show clearly the substantial effects of the observational bias , as can be seen in figures [ fluxdistfig ] and [ adistfig ] .",
    "the intrinsic differential counts can be fitted adequately by a broken power law and the photon index appears to have an intrinsic gaussian distribution .",
    "we also find that in general the values reported here are consistent with those reported in bp1 and ma for the power law slopes of the flux distribution @xmath33 above the breaks and the distributions of photon index @xmath34 .",
    "the allowed range of the correlation parameter @xmath28 here and in bp1 allows for wider uncertainty in these values in some cases than in ma .",
    "however , as expected , the uncertainty is generally lower here than in bp1 , as this sample has roughly twice as many sources .",
    "we note that in this work we find systematically steeper power law slopes of the flux distribution @xmath33 below the breaks than in bp1 and ma .",
    "the differences with ma are significant although the differences with bp1 are not significant at the 1@xmath29 level due to the larger uncertainties .",
    "we also note that the best - fitting widths of the gaussian fits to the photon index distributions are systematically smaller here than in bp1 and ma for the cases of all blazars and bl lacs , but not for fsrqs , and that the mean photon index for all blazars found here is higher than in the other works , and this is entirely the result of the mean photon index for fsrqs being higher .    using the bias free flux distributions we calculated the integrated contribution of fsrqs and bl lacs to the egb as a function of flux . we obtain this directly from the cumulative flux distribution which is the main output of the methods used . using the simplistic assumption that the distributions continue unchanged to arbitrarily low flux",
    ", the best fit contribution of fsrqs and bl lacs to the total extragalactic gamma - ray radiation in the range from 0.1 to 100 gev is estimated to be 35% and 17% respectively .",
    "the significant uncertainties reported here for the source count slopes and the estimated contribution of blazars to the egb are ultimately due to the allowed range of the correlation parameter @xmath28 , as discussed at length in bp1 .",
    "these results for the proportional contribution to the egb are roughly consistent with a number of other findings . in @xcite",
    "we consider redshift evolution effects with a smaller sample with available redshifts and find that for fsrqs the contribution to the egb is 22(+10/-4)% , while @xcite report 30.1(+2.5/-1.7)% for fsrqs and @xcite estimate that bl lacs contribute between 10%-15% of the egb , with all of these reported here scaled to account for the subsequently reduced estimated level of the egb as discussed in  [ bgndradsec ] .",
    "however , we note that one would not necessarily expect exact agreement between the estimates of total photon output derived here extrapolating the flux distributions to arbitrarily low flux and those derived considering the full redshift evolutions , for two primary reasons .",
    "one is that as the populations clearly have both luminosity and density evolution in redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one would not expect the flux distribution to remain constant at lower fluxes .",
    "the other is that blazars likely do not continue to arbitrarily low flux , indeed in bp1 we argue that a reasonable lower cutoff flux for blazars would be around @xmath103 photons @xmath6 sec@xmath7 .",
    "the fact that we do find reasonable agreement between the estimates here and those arrived at considering redshift evolutions indicates not only that analyses seem to be consistent , but also that there may be a `` conspiracy '' where luminosity and density evolution effects , as well as an absolute luminosity cutoff for blazars , and any effects from contributions missed here because some 17% of 2 lac blazars are of unclassified type , sum in such a way as to render extrapolations of the distributions recovered here to arbitrarily low fluxes appropriate .",
    "it also points to the utility of comparing this analysis , which is based on the statistically larger 3lac sample which is the largest extant sample of gamma - ray detected blazars , with those of smaller samples that contain complete redshift information .",
