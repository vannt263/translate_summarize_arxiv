    "in a dense neutrino gas , neutrino - neutrino refraction causes nonlinear flavor oscillation phenomena  @xcite . in the region between the neutrino sphere and a radius of several hundred kilometers in a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) , the flavor content of neutrino fluxes",

    "ordinary msw resonances typically occur at much larger distances and process the spectra further in well - understood ways  @xcite .",
    "one particularly intriguing feature of the emerging fluxes is a `` spectral split . ''",
    "what this means is best described with the help of an example . in fig .",
    "[ fig : snspectrum ] we show thermal @xmath1 and @xmath2 flux spectra with an average energy of 15  mev produced in the neutrino sphere of a sn core ( thin lines ) .",
    "this example is schematic in that we assume equal average @xmath1 and @xmath2 energies but an overall @xmath2 flux that is only 70% of the @xmath1 flux .",
    "moreover , the smaller fluxes of the other species @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are completely ignored .",
    "we are considering two - flavor oscillations between @xmath1 and another flavor @xmath7 , driven by the atmospheric mass squared difference @xmath8@xmath9 and the small 1 - 3 mixing angle . therefore in fig .",
    "[ fig : snspectrum ] we show the @xmath10components of the usual two - flavor polarization vectors , where `` up '' denotes the electron flavor and `` down '' the @xmath11flavor .",
    "in other words , the spectrum represents electron ( anti)neutrinos where it is positive and @xmath11 ( anti)neutrinos where it is negative .",
    "( anti)neutrinos.[fig : snspectrum ] ]    after a few 100  km , the neutrino - neutrino effects have completely died out .",
    "the emerging spectra are shown as thick lines .",
    "the antineutrinos ( dashed ) have completely flipped to the @xmath11flavor .",
    "the same is true for the neutrinos ( solid ) down to a critical energy @xmath0 where the spectrum splits .",
    "all @xmath1 below this energy emerge in their original flavor .",
    "spectral splits of this sort were first observed in the numerical simulations of duan et al .",
    "@xcite where a first interpretation was given .",
    "later these authors have introduced the term `` stepwise spectral swapping '' to describe this phenomenon  @xcite .    in a previous short paper",
    "@xcite we have shown that @xmath0 is fixed by what we call lepton - number conservation . for a sufficiently small in - medium mixing angle",
    "the collective flavor transformations have the property of conserving flavor number in the sense that only pairs @xmath12 are transformed to pairs @xmath13 , whereas the excess @xmath1 flux is conserved  @xcite .",
    "while this property does not explain the existence of a spectral split , it explains its location that for the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : snspectrum ] is at @xmath14 .",
    "the split phenomenon becomes clearer when the spectra are represented in terms of the oscillation frequency @xmath15 instead of the energy itself  @xcite . in the evolution equations",
    "the only difference between neutrinos and antineutrinos is that the latter appear with a negative @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , one should think of the neutrino and antineutrino spectra as a single continuum @xmath17 .",

    "an excess of the @xmath2flux is typical for the leptonizing accretion torus of merging neutron stars that are probably the central engines of short gamma - ray bursts .",

    "the interpretation of the split phenomenon proposed by duan et al .",
    "@xcite motivated us to develop a quantitative theory of this effect based on the idea of adiabatic evolution of individual modes  @xcite .",
    "while the self - interacting neutrino ensemble follows a set of nonlinear equations of motion ( eoms ) , the evolution of individual modes can be written in the form of single - particle eoms where the neutrino - neutrino interaction is included self - consistently by a slowly varying `` mean field '' in the single - mode hamiltonians .",
    "the crucial step was to obtain two sum rules ( integrals over the neutrino spectrum in the @xmath16variable ) that had to equal certain conserved quantities , notably the flavor lepton number of the system  @xcite .",
    "these sum rules provide an explicit adiabatic solution of the problem .",
    "the degree of adiabaticity manifests itself in the `` sharpness '' of the spectral split .",
    "the adiabatic evolution is driven by the decreasing neutrino - neutrino interaction strength as a function of distance from the sn core .",
    "as we dial the scale height to larger values , the spectral split becomes sharper , approaching a step function in the limit of an infinitely slow evolution .",
    "this situation is similar to the usual msw case , for example in the outer layers of a sn envelope .",
    "the @xmath1 flux streaming through a resonance region completely converts , for the normal hierarchy , while the antineutrinos remain unchanged .",
    "in other words , in the case of perfect adiabaticity the usual msw effect is a spectral - split phenomenon with @xmath27 . in this sense",
    "the main effect of the neutrino - neutrino interaction is to shift @xmath28 to a non - vanishing value .",
    "we will further discuss this analogy in the context of adiabaticity breaking in sec .",
    "[ sec : transients ]",
    ".    the main purpose of our paper is to elaborate several issues that were kept short in our previous publication  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "nonlinear flavor transformations caused by neutrino - neutrino interactions involve two main complications .",
    "one is the energy dependence of the effect , a question that we will address here .",
    "the other is the `` multi - angle '' nature of the transformations .",
    "if a neutrino gas is not perfectly isotropic , neutrinos moving in different directions feel a different refractive effect caused by the other neutrinos because the interaction energy between two neutrinos depends on their relative direction as @xmath29 . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects kinematical decoherence of the flavor content of different angular modes . for equal densities of neutrinos and antineutrinos ,",
    "decoherence indeed occurs and is even self - accelerating in that an infinitesimally small anisotropy is enough to trigger an exponential runaway towards complete flavor equilibrium  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the neutrino - neutrino interaction decreases slowly and if the asymmetry between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is sufficiently large , one observes numerically that decoherence is suppressed . in the sn context",
    ", the deleptonization flux appears to be large enough to prevent multi - angle decoherence  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we limit ourselves to an isotropic gas with a slowly decreasing density .",
    "the ensemble is fully characterized by a matrix of densities in flavor space for each spectral component @xmath30 , separately for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the energies enter only through the vacuum oscillation frequencies @xmath15 which determine the behavior of different modes .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to use @xmath16 directly to label the modes . in the two - flavor context",
    "we use the usual polarization vectors so that the ensemble is represented by two sets of polarization vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the global polarization vectors , @xmath33 are initially normalized as @xmath34 notice that @xmath35 and @xmath32 are densities relative to the @xmath16 variable so that they have the dimension of @xmath36 .",
    "the individual lengths @xmath37 and @xmath38 are conserved as long as oscillations are the only form of evolution , i.e. , in the absence of dynamical decoherence caused by collisions .",
    "in contrast , the total lengths @xmath39 and @xmath40 are only conserved when all individual polarization vectors evolve in the same  way . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the spectra of frequencies given by an initial condition .",
    "we assume that initially all @xmath35 and @xmath32 are aligned .",
    "in other words , all neutrinos and antineutrinos begin in the electron flavor .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this assumption to a situation where some modes begin in the @xmath11flavor ( `` spectral cross - over , '' see sec .  [ sec : crossover ] ) . in this more general case",
    ", the @xmath35 and @xmath32 may initially also be anti - aligned relative to the common flavor direction .",
    "following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite let us introduce the difference vector @xmath43 representing the net lepton number .",
    "using the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite , the eoms  are @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass direction and @xmath46 the vacuum mixing angle . for the inverted mass hierarchy @xmath47 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath48 is the weak charged - current interaction direction so that @xmath49 .",
    "finally , @xmath50 is the usual matter potential and @xmath51 the potential due to neutrino - neutrino interactions with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being the electron and neutrino densities .",
    "we use time @xmath54 instead of radius @xmath55 because we study an isotropic system that evolves in time instead of a single - angle system evolving in space .    in the sn context",
    ", the neutrino flux dilutes as @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , the trajectories become more collinear with distance , leading to an average suppression of the interaction energy by another factor @xmath56 @xcite so that altogether we should use @xmath57 . however , in the adiabatic limit the exact form of @xmath58 is irrelevant as long as its rate of change is small . for our numerical examples",
    "it is more convenient to use the profile @xmath59 the exponential form is simpler because it involves the same scale @xmath60 at all times .",
    "adjusting @xmath61 allows one to control the adiabaticity of the transition with a single parameter . assuming the atmospheric @xmath62 and typical sn neutrino energies",
    ", we find that @xmath63 is typical for the average vacuum oscillation frequency .",
    "the crucial action takes place at the relatively large radius of a few hundred kilometers .",
    "together with the @xmath64 scaling this implies a characteristic rate of change of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muexp ] ) a value @xmath66 roughly captures the situation in a  sn .      unless there is an msw resonance in the dense - neutrino region , one can eliminate @xmath67 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) by going into a rotating frame  @xcite .",
    "the price for this transformation is that in the new frame @xmath68 has a static component @xmath69 along the @xmath70 direction and a fast - rotating one in the transverse direction . assuming that the effect of the fast - rotating component averages to zero , we may consider the equivalent situation where the usual matter is completely absent and initially all polarization vectors are aligned with @xmath71 ( which really is the projection of the true @xmath68 on the weak - interaction direction @xmath70 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a vanishing vacuum mixing angle .",
    "of course , this is not the complete story because for a strictly vanishing vacuum mixing angle , no transformation effects would take place at all .",
    "the rotating component of @xmath68 disturbs the perfect alignment of @xmath35 and @xmath32 , providing a kick start for flavor conversions  @xcite .",
    "for a system consisting of equal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos , the equations were solved analytically  @xcite .",
    "the net effect was found to be equivalent to a small ( but nonvanishing ) effective mixing angle , although the evolution of the polarization vectors is initially modulated by the rotating @xmath68 field with the frequency  @xmath72 .",
    "we have here a different system where the density of neutrinos exceeds that of antineutrinos and where the evolution of the system is driven by the @xmath58 variation .",
    "numerically one finds that once more the effect of matter is equivalent to reducing the vacuum mixing angle to a certain effective mixing angle @xmath73 similar to the usual in - medium mixing angle  @xcite , but an analytic treatment of how ordinary matter modifies the initial evolution is not available .    motivated by this evidence we make the simplification of ignoring the ordinary matter term entirely , schematically accounting for it by a small initial effective mixing angle .",
    "notice that in the absence of the interaction vector @xmath70 we define the effective mixing angle as the angle between @xmath74 and @xmath68 .",
    "our treatment is exact for a system where the only interaction is that of the neutrinos among each other . while we can not claim with mathematical rigor that this system is a faithful proxy for what happens in a real sn",
    ", numerical observations suggest that this is the case .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath32 differs from that for @xmath35 only by the sign of frequency : @xmath75 .",
    "so , the only difference for antineutrinos is that in vacuum they oscillate `` the other way round . ''",
    "therefore , instead of using @xmath32 we may extend @xmath35 to negative frequencies such that @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and use only @xmath35 with @xmath17 . after eliminating the matter term @xmath67 the eoms then",

    "the transverse component of @xmath74 quickly averages to zero ( kinematical decoherence ) , whereas the component along @xmath68 is conserved .",
    "we will here study the opposite limit where @xmath84 decreases slowly , leading to a very different final result .      since @xmath68 is constant , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomd ] ) shows that @xmath88 and therefore @xmath89 where here and henceforth we will denote the component of a vector parallel to @xmath68 with the index @xmath90 , the transverse component with the index @xmath91 .    the physical interpretation of the conservation law eq .  ( [ eq : db ] ) is what we call `` flavor lepton - number conservation '' or simply `` lepton - number conservation . ''",
    "rigorously it only means that in the absence of matter the projection of @xmath74 on @xmath68 is conserved .",
    "however , in all examples of practical interest in the sn context , the effective mixing angle is small so that initially @xmath92 and @xmath68 are nearly collinear .",
    "therefore , the net @xmath1 flux from deleptonization is approximately conserved until an msw resonance is encountered .",
    "collective effects only induce pair transformations of the form @xmath93 , whereas the excess of the @xmath1 flux from deleptonization is conserved .",

    "therefore , if we begin with an initial condition of perfect alignment combined with a finite @xmath84 , the system is initially not in a pure precession mode .",
    "even if the subsequent @xmath58 evolution is infinitely slow , the polarization vectors will not be perfectly aligned with the hamiltonians of the adiabatic solution .    in a linear system",
    "this situation would not spell a deviation from adiabaticity .",
    "usually adiabaticity is taken to mean that the polarization vectors follow the hamiltonians , but they need not be aligned with them .",

    "here the situation is different in that the @xmath35 define @xmath74 and thus affect the single - mode hamiltonians @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , these hamiltonians must now themselves show fast motions when they are viewed from the co - rotating frame .",
    "still , if the initial @xmath84 is large ( but finite ) , the deviation from a static solution is small and one expects that nonlinear effects appear only at second order in the small deviations of the polarization vectors from their adiabatic solutions .",
    "one would expect that the @xmath35 precess around the nearly static @xmath97 where the opening angle of the precession cone no longer vanishes .",
    "notice that since @xmath74 depends on many modes the fast motion of the latter to some extend cancels in @xmath74 and therefore @xmath100 . this behavior is borne out in numerical examples .",
    "this numerical observation implies that the adiabatic solution is a stable fixed point of the system , i.e. , a small perturbation does not lead to a run  away .",
    "rather , the system always evolves close to the adiabatic solution and oscillates around it .",
    "the stability of the adiabatic solution is not automatically implied by its existence as a self - consistent solution of the eoms .",

    "they are , therefore , a non - adiabatic feature and indeed disappear numerically if we use an unrealistically slow @xmath58 variation .",
    "it has been shown that the eoms of a system consisting of only two polarization vectors , one for neutrinos and one for anti - neutrinos as in sec .",
    "[ sec : twovectors ] , are equivalent to a gyroscopic pendulum in flavor space  @xcite .",
    "its general motion consists of a precession around @xmath68 and a nutation that causes the overall zenith - angle modulation .",
    "for very large neutrino - neutrino interactions ( very small @xmath205 ) , the pendulum is in the `` sleeping top phase '' @xcite where its motion is a nearly pure precession . in the neutrino language",
    "this corresponds to the synchronized regime where all polarization vectors are strictly pinned to each other and precess around @xmath68 as a collective object .",
    "once @xmath205 becomes larger than the `` cusp value , '' the gyroscope begins to wobble . in the neutrino language , this is the point where the polarization vectors begin to spread in the zenith - angle direction and are no longer strictly pinned to each other .",
    "the nutations are excited because the flavor pendulum initially deviates only by the small angle @xmath421 from the inverted vertical direction .",
    "starting the pendular motion requires this small angle to grow under the influence of the external force , introducing a time scale that depends logarithmically on @xmath421 .",
    "if the @xmath58 variation is fast compared to this time scale , the pendulum can not follow the adiabatic solution .",
    "this explains that the depth of the nutation amplitude becomes larger for a smaller @xmath421 .",
    "the case of a vanishing @xmath421 was the main example that we studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : both ] .",
    "while one can find a perfectly self - consistent static solution for this case , it is clear that the system can not follow this solution : for a vanishing mixing angle the system will not move at all , i.e. , the delay leading to nutations is infinite . therefore , this example was an instructive limiting case , but can not be realized as an adiabatically connected sequence of static solutions .",
    "a remarkable feature of the nutations shown in fig .  [ fig : nunubarspectrum2 ] is that they are a collective effect of all modes .",
    "we can not interpret the nutations as a simple precession of the individual @xmath35 around the static hamiltonians .",

    "once more we are numerically led to the conclusion that the adiabatic solution represents a stable attractor of the nonlinear system .",

    "we stress that the individual @xmath35 evolve under the influence of their instantaneous hamiltonians @xmath100 which are not identical with the ones of the adiabatic solution .",
    "the instantaneous hamiltonians themselves nutate , although they nutate around the static hamiltonians .",
    "we recall , however , that the instantaneous hamiltonians always lie in a single plane , whereas this is not the case for the polarization vectors .",
    "moreover , the motion of the instantaneous hamiltonians is governed by the variation of the single vector @xmath74 so that they must move in lockstep with each other .",
    "another important feature of the nutations is that they are a transient phenomenon that dies out toward the end of the evolution when @xmath147 as explained in the flavor pendulum picture  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectral split remains unaffected . even though all polarization vectors wildly nutate , they begin and end ( anti)aligned with @xmath111 except for those modes near the split that anyway do not reach the final ( anti)alignment .",
    "the modes sufficiently far from the split begin and end aligned with the static hamiltonians , whereas for intermediate times they wildly nutate .",
    "the nutations have no apparent impact on the final flavor spectrum of the system .",
    "we have elaborated our previous theory  @xcite of spectral splits that occur as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of a neutrino ensemble .",
    "we have clarified that the spectral - split phenomenon in itself is not an entirely new effect , but a very useful way of looking even at the usual msw effect if we express its energy dependence in terms of the oscillation frequency @xmath424 and if we identify antineutrino modes with negative frequencies . however , in the case of collective transformations the effect has some distinctive features : the position of the split is fixed by the flavor lepton number of the system and does not depend on other parameters .",
    "the main impact of collective neutrino - neutrino interactions is that the evolution is adiabatic not in the laboratory frame , but rather in a co - rotating frame that is defined by a plane in flavor space which is spanned by the mass direction @xmath68 and the vector @xmath74 which is the polarization vector of the overall flavor lepton number of the system .",
    "this frame defines a static solution of the eoms that consists , in the laboratory frame , of a pure precession of all polarization vectors around @xmath68 .",

    "we must find the co - rotating frame explicitly .",
    "this is achieved in terms of two sum rules ( @xmath16integrals over the spectrum @xmath41 ) that guarantee the self  consistency of the static solution , i.e. , of the pure precession mode .",

    "the adiabatic solution is determined completely by two functions @xmath135 and @xmath426 .",
    "we study properties of these functions for several different neutrino spectra . for the neutrino - only box spectrum and non - zero initial effective mixing angle both functions decrease monotonically with @xmath84 : @xmath427 and @xmath428 .    in the presence of antineutrinos",
    "the behavior substantially changes : for small initial mixing angles the dependence @xmath135 has a cusp at a certain density @xmath429 .",

    "very similar quantitative features appear for the continuous double - box spectrum and for the bi - chromatic spectrum .",
    "the latter case , by the gyroscopic flavor - pendulum analogy , allows one to understand a number of subtle features which also show up for continuous spectra .",
    "the adiabatic solution is an approximate solution of the eoms .",
    "there are several features which appear in the exact solution that are not described by the adiabatic solution .",
    "the violation of adiabaticity always takes place at late stages of evolution ( at small @xmath84 ) for modes with @xmath16 close to @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to a partial wash - out of the split so that the degree of adiabaticity determines the sharpness of the split .",
    "numerically it appears that for a given spectrum the profile of the split is a universal function of the density gradient and does not seem to depend on other parameters . measuring the width of the split region would allow one to determine the neutrino density gradient in the region @xmath430 .",
    "nutations related to bipolar transitions represent another deviation from adiabaticity .",
    "the nutations occur around the adiabatic solution , or , in other words , the adiabatic solution appears as an average over nutations .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the nutations do not visibly influence the final result .",
    "they disappear as the neutrino density decreases and thus are only a transient phenomenon .",
    "our treatment leaves a number of interesting questions unresolved .",
    "while the self - consistency conditions determine the static solution , we have not realized under which circumstances such solutions actually exist , although we have not found a counter example .",
    "the adiabatic solution is stable in typical numerical examples in that the true solution of the eoms tracks this adiabatic solution .",
    "there could be situations where this is not the case , leading to kinematical decoherence rather than a collective oscillation of the individual modes .    even though several important aspects of this system are only numerically observed and not analytically proven , we believe that our adiabatic treatment of the eoms nicely explains many of the intriguing features of this nonlinear system .",
