    "the cp symmetry is , without doubt , one of the fundamental symmetries in nature .",
    "its breaking still carries a cloud of mystery in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "indeed , cp symmetry is intimately related to theories of interactions between elementary particles and represents a cornerstone in constructing grand unified and supersymmetric models .",
    "it is also necessary to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in universe .",
    "the first experimental evidence of cp violation was discovered in the @xmath3 mixing and kaon decays @xcite . according to the cpt theorem , cp violation implies t violation .",
    "the latter is tested through the measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm)@xmath0 .",
    "the upper experimental limit gives confidence that the nedm can be another manifestation of cp breaking . to investigate the cp violation phenomenon",
    "many theoretical models were proposed . in the standard model of electroweak interactions",
    ", cp violation is parametrized by a single phase in the cabbibo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "other models exhibiting a cp violation are given by extensions of the standard model ; among them , the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xmath4 includes in general soft complex parameters which provide new additional sources of cp violation @xcite .",
    "cp violation can be also investigated in the strong interactions context through qcd framework .",
    "in fact , the qcd effective lagrangian contains an additional cp - odd four dimensional operator embedded in the following topological term : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gluonic field strength , @xmath7 is its dual and @xmath8 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath9 quantity is a total derivative , consequently it can contribute to the physical observables only through non perturbative effects .",
    "the nedm is related to the @xmath10-angle by the following relation : @xmath11 and consequently , according to the experimental measurements @xmath12 @xcite , the @xmath13 parameter must be less than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the well known strong cp problem consists in explaining the smallness of @xmath1 . in this regard , several scenarios were suggested .",
    "the most known one was proposed by peccei and quinn @xcite and consists in implementing an extra @xmath15 symmetry which permits a dynamical suppression of the undesired @xmath16-term .",
    "this is possible due to the fact that the axial current @xmath17 is related to the gluonic field strength through the following relation @xmath18 .",
    "the breakdown of the @xmath15 symmetry gives arise to a very light pseudogoldstone boson called axion .",
    "this particle may well be important to the puzzle of dark matter and might constitute the missing mass of the universe @xcite .    motivated by : ( a ) the direct relation between the @xmath19-angle and nedm @xmath20 , as it was demonstrated firstly in @xcite via the chiral perturbation theory and recently in @xcite within qcd sum rules formalism ; ( b ) the possibility to restore some broken symmetries by increasing the temperature ; we shall use the qcd sum rules at @xmath21 @xcite to derive thermal dependence of the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "then we study its thermal behaviour at low temperatures and discuss the consequences of temperature effects on the restoration of the broken cp symmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 is devoted to the calculations of the nedm induced by the @xmath23 parameter from qcd sum rules . in section 3",
    ", we show how one introduces temperature in qcd sum rules calculations .",
    "we end this paper with a discussion and qualitative analysis of the thermal effects on the cp symmetry .",
    "in the two later decades , qcd sum rules  la svz @xcite were applied successfully to the investigation of hadronic properties at low energies . in order to derive the nedm through this approach",
    ", many calculations were performed in the literature @xcite .",
    "one of them , which turns out to be more practical for our study , has been obtained recently in @xcite .",
    "it consists in considering a lagrangian containing the following p and cp violating operators : @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively two angles coming from the chiral and the topological terms and @xmath27 is the quark reduced mass given by @xmath27=@xmath28 .",
    "the authors of @xcite start from the two points correlation function in qcd background with a nonvanishing @xmath26 and in the presence of a constant external electomagnetic field @xmath29 : @xmath30 @xmath31 is the interpolating current which in the case of the neutron reads as @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a mixing parameter . using the operator product expansion ( ope ) ,",
    "they have first performed the calculation of @xmath34 as a function of matrix elements and wilson coefficients and then have confronted the qcd expression of @xmath34 to its phenomenological parametrisation .",
    "@xmath34 can be expanded in terms of the electromagnetic charge as@xcite : @xmath35 the first term @xmath36 is the nucleon propagator which include only the cp - even parameters @xcite , while the second term @xmath37 is the polarization tensor which may be expanded through wilson ope as : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an arbitrary lorentz structure and @xmath40 are the wilson coefficient functions calculable in perturbation theory @xcite . from this expansion ,",
    "one keeps only the cp - odd contribution piece . by considering the anomalous axial current",
    ", one obtains the following @xmath26 dependence of @xmath41 matrix elements @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath27 are respectively the quark and reduced masses .",
    "the electromagnetic dependence of these matrix elements can be parametrized through the implementation of the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 susceptibilities defined as @xcite : + @xmath47    putting altogether the above ingredients and after a straightforward calculation @xcite , the following expression of @xmath37 for the neutron is derived : + @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the physical phase and @xmath50 .",
    "+ the qcd expression ( 2.7 ) will be confronted to the phenomenological parametrisation @xmath51@xmath52 written in terms of the neutron hadronic properties .",
    "the latter is given by : + @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the neutron mass , @xmath55 is the quark charge .",
    "a and @xmath56 , which originate from the phenomenological side of the sum rule , represent respectively a constant of dimension 2 and the neutron coupling constant to the interpolating current @xmath31 .",
    "this coupling is defined via a spinor @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "the introduction of finite temperature effects may provide more precision to the phenomenological values of hadronic observables . within the framework of qcd sum rules ,",
    "the t - evolution of the correlation functions appear as a thermal average of the local operators in the wilson expansion@xcite .",
    "hence , at nonzero temperature and in the approximation of the non interacting gas of bosons ( pions ) , the vacuum condensates can be written as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61is the bose - einstein distribution and @xmath62 is the standard vacuum condensate ( i.e. at t=0 ) . in the low temperature region ,",
    "the effects of heavier resonances @xmath63 can be neglected due to their distibution functions @xmath64@xcite . to compute the pion matrix elements ,",
    "we apply the soft pion theorem given by : @xmath65|0>+ o({m^2_\\pi \\over \\lambda^2}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 is a hadron scale and @xmath67 is the isovector axial charge : @xmath68 direct application of the above formula to the quark and gluon condensates shows that @xcite : + ( i ) only @xmath69 is sensitive to temperature .",
    "its behaviour at finite t is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the pion decay constant ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the variation with temperature of the quark condensate @xmath75 results in two different asymptotic behaviours , namely : + @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "+ ( ii ) the gluon condensate is nearly constant at low temperature and a t dependence occurs only at order @xmath80 .    as usual , the determination of the ratio @xmath81 sum rules at non zero temperature is now easily performed through two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we apply borel operator to both expressions of the neutron correlation function shown in eqs .",
    "( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) , where finite temperature effects were introduced as discussed above .",
    "next step , by invoking the quark - hadron duality principle , we deduce the following relation of the @xmath82 induced nedm : @xmath83e^{m_n^2 \\over m^2},\\ ] ] where m represents the borel parameter . note that we have neglected the single pole contribution entering via the constant a , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "+ the expression ( 3.5 ) is derived with @xmath84 which is more appropriate for us since it suppresses the infrared divergences . in fact , the ioffe choice @xmath85 which is rather more useful for the cp even case , removes the leading order contribution in the sum rules ( 2.7 ) . the coupling constant @xmath86 and the neutron mass @xmath87 which appear in ( 3.5 )",
    "were determined from the thermal qcd sum rules . for the former",
    ", we consider the @xmath88 sum rules in @xcite with @xmath84 and then we extract the following explicit expression of @xmath86 : @xmath89    within the pion gas approximation , eletsky has demonstrated in @xcite that inclusion of the contribution coming from the pion - nucleon scattering in the nucleon sum rules is mandatory .",
    "the latter enters eq.(3.6 ) through the coupling constant @xmath90 , whose values lie within the range 13.5 - 14.3 @xcite . + numerical analysis",
    "is performed with the following input parameters : the borel mass has been chosen within the values @xmath91 which correspond to the optimal range ( borel window ) in the @xmath92 sum rule at @xmath93 @xcite . for the @xmath94 and @xmath46 susceptibilities",
    "we take @xmath95 @xcite and @xmath96 @xcite . as to the vacuum condensates appearing in ( 3.5 ) , we fix @xmath69 and @xmath97 to their standard values @xcite .",
    "in the two above sections , we have established the relation between the nedm and @xmath98 angle at non zero temperature from qcd sum rules .",
    "since the ratio @xmath99 is expressed in terms of the pion parameters @xmath73 , @xmath100 and of @xmath90 , we briefly recall the main features of their thermal behaviour .",
    "various studies performed either within the framework of the chiral perturbation theory and/or qcd sum rules at low temperature have shown the following features : + ( i ) the existence of qcd phase transition temperature @xmath101 which signals both qcd deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath73 and @xmath90 have very small variation with temperature up to @xmath101 .",
    "so , we shall assume them as constants below @xmath101 .",
    "however , they vanish if the temperature passes through the critical value @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "+ ( iii ) the thermal mass shift of the neutron and the pion is absent at order @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "@xmath103 shows up only at the next order @xmath104 , but its value is negligible @xcite . + by taking into account the above properties , we plot the ratio defined in eq . ( 3.5 ) as a function of t. from the figure",
    ", we learn that the ratio @xmath105 survives at finite temperature and it decreases smoothly with t ( about 16@xmath106 variation for temperature values up to 200 mev ) .",
    "this means that either the nedm value decreases or @xmath1 increases .",
    "consequently , for a fixed value of @xmath1 the nedm decreases but it does not exhibit any critical behaviour . furthermore ,",
    "if we start from a non vanishing @xmath98 value at @xmath93 , it is not possible to remove it at finite temperature .",
    "we also note that @xmath107 grows as @xmath108 or @xmath94 susceptibility increases",
    ". it also grows with quark condensate rising .",
    "however this ratio is insensitive to both the @xmath46 susceptibility and the coupling constant @xmath90 .",
    "we notice that for higher temperatures , the curve @xmath109 exhibits a brutal increase justified by the fact that for temperatures beyond the critical value @xmath101 , at which the chiral symmetry is restored , the constants @xmath73 and @xmath90 become zero and consequently from eq(3.5 ) the ratio @xmath110 behaves as a non vanishing constant .",
    "the large difference between the values of the ratio for @xmath111 and @xmath112 maybe a consequence of the fact that we have neglected other contributions to the the spectral function , like the scattering process @xmath113 .",
    "these contributions , which are of the order @xmath104 , are negligible in the low temperture region but become substantial for @xmath114 . moreover ,",
    "this difference may also originate from the use of soft pion approximation which is valid essentially for low @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "therefore it is clear from this qualitative analysis , which is based on the soft pion approximation , that the temperature does not play a fundamental role in the suppression of the undesired @xmath26-term and hence the broken cp symmetry is not restored , as expected .",
    "this is not strange , in fact it was shown that more heat does not imply automatically more symmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , some exact symmetries can be broken by increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the symmetry non restoration phenomenon , which means that a broken symmetry at t=0 remains broken even at high temperature , is essential for discrete symmetries , cp symmetry in particular . indeed , the symmetry non restoration allows us to avoid wall domains inherited after the phase transition @xcite and to explain the baryogenesis phenomenon in cosmology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be very useful for solving the monopole problem in grand unified theories @xcite .",
