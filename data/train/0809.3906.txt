    "an important clue on the assembly redshift of a galaxy is provided by its dark matter density .",

    "the main difference is that k2000 galaxies are brighter ( and have higher stellar mass ) than coma early - types with a similar halo .",
    "can this be an artifact related to differences in the dynamical models ?",
    "many of the k2000 models are based on @xmath2-band photometry , while we used @xmath93-band images for the coma galaxies .",
    "elliptical galaxies become bluer towards the outer parts and @xmath2-band light profiles are slightly shallower than @xmath18-band profiles .",
    "likewise , mass profiles of galaxies are generally shallower than their light profiles , such that there might be less need for dark matter in @xmath2-band models than in @xmath18-band models .",
    "@xcite checked for this by modelling one galaxy ( ngc3379 ) in both bands and found comparable results .",
    "the photometric data is therefore unlikely to cause the differences between the two samples .",
    "k2000 galaxies were modelled assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "not all apparently round galaxies need to be intrinsically spherical . neglecting the flattening along",
    "the line - of - sight can result in an underestimation of a galaxy s mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on the average intrinsic flattening of ellipticals in the luminosity interval of interest here , @xcite estimated that the assumption of spherical symmetry should affect mass - to - light ratios only at the 10 percent level .",
    "we expect the effect on @xmath12 to be correspondingly small .",
    "in addition , it is not obvious why spherical symmetry should enforce systematically small @xmath11 , such that the different symmetry assumptions are also unlikely to explain the more extended cores and higher circular velocities in coma galaxy halos .",
    "since the shape of a galaxy is related to its evolutionary history , the round and non - rotating k2000 galaxies could be intrinsically different from the mostly flattened and rotating coma galaxies .",
    "structural differences could also be related to the fact that k2000 galaxies are located in a variety of environments , with less galaxies in high density regions like coma .",
    "for example , stellar population models indicate that field ellipticals are on average younger and have more extended star formation histories than cluster galaxies @xcite . but",
    "a mere difference in the stellar populations can not explain the difference between k2000 and coma galaxies , as in this case the scalings with @xmath82 should be similar in both samples .",
    "this is ruled out by fig .",

    "noteworthy , most of the k2000 galaxies in figs .",
    "[ fig : rhvh ] - [ fig : rh_reff ] appear similar to the four coma galaxies with distinctly small @xmath11 and @xmath12 . as it has been discussed above",
    ", these galaxies may have entered the coma cluster only recently and  in this respect  are more representative for a field galaxy population rather than being genuine old cluster galaxies . a consistent explanation for both , the offset between young and old coma galaxies on the one side and the difference between old coma galaxies and k2000 galaxies on the other would then be that field galaxies have lower @xmath11 and lower @xmath12 than cluster galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "because there are more field galaxies in the k2000 sample than in coma , coma galaxy halos would be expected to have on average larger cores and to be more massive ( consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : rhvh ] ) . a larger comparison sample of field elliptical halos is required to conclude finally upon this point .",

    "[ fig : rhvh ] - [ fig : rh_reff ] fit the combined sample of 55 rotation curve decompositions of @xcite .",
    "these authors discuss various halo profiles , but we here only consider non - singular isothermal dark matter halos . though these are most similar to equation ( [ logdef ] ) , isothermal cores and circular velocities are not exactly identical as in logarithmic halos . to account for the difference , we fitted a logarithmic halo to a non - singular isothermal density profile ( cf . tab .",
    "4.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the fit was restricted to the region with kinematic data ( typically inside two core - radii ) .",
    "we found that the logarithmic halo fit yields a 3 percent larger core - radius @xmath11 and a 10 percent smaller circular velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the central halo density is reproduced to 0.001 dex ( not surprising given that the cores of the two profiles were matched ) .",

    "if the bulk of stars in these galaxies is old , however , then the related radial increase of the stellar mass - to - light ratio could contribute to their small @xmath11 and large @xmath83 .",
    "this , because in our models it is assumed that the stellar mass - to - light ratio is radially constant . by construction then , any increase in the mass - to - light ratio with radius ( being either due to a stellar population gradient or due to dark matter ) is attributed to the halo component . in galaxies with a significant increase of the stellar @xmath104 with radius ,",

    "isolated field spirals are drawn from objects with @xmath155 in the semi - analytic models @xcite .",

    "we use dust - corrected luminosities @xmath92 of the semi - analytic models .",
    "dark matter halos of simulated galaxies are reconstructed from tabulated virial velocities @xmath159 , virial radii @xmath160 , and maximum circular velocities @xmath161 as follows .",

    "[ fig : dm_sam ] shows that the average dark matter densities @xmath102 of the coma early - types match fairly well with semi - analytical models .",
    "this is remarkable , because the simulations do not take into account the halo response during baryon infall .",
    "therefore , either the net effect of the baryons on the dark matter distribution is small in the analyzed population of galaxies or there is actually a mismatch between the halos of observed galaxies and the @xmath5-body models .",
    "it may also be that real galaxies do not have maximum stellar masses .",
    "this can be checked by the comparison of dynamically derived stellar mass - to - light ratios with independent stellar population synthesis models ( thomas et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    similarly to what is found in real galaxies ,",
    "the dark matter densities of spirals are lower than in ellipticals in semi - analytic models ( cf .",
    "[ fig : dm_sam ] ) , but the density contrast in observed galaxies is larger .",
    "again , a major uncertainty here is that the simulations do not take into account the gravitational effect of the baryons .",
    "formation redshifts of simulated and observed galaxies are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_sam ] .",
    "coma galaxy @xmath170 are from sec .",
    "[ sec : assembly ] and both cases discussed there  with and without baryon correction  are shown separately in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "formation redshifts of simulated galaxies are defined as the earliest redshift , when a halo has assembled 50 percent of its mass .",
    "since we are mainly interested in cluster ellipticals , we need to take into account that interactions between the cluster halo and a galaxy s subhalo cause a mass - loss in the latter .",
    "although cluster - galaxy interactions happen in both simulated and observed galaxies , the mass - loss in the simulations may be overestimated because of the finite numerical resolution and the neglect of the baryon potential .",
    "in particular , for simulated subhalos with very low masses at @xmath171 the derived formation redshifts may be artificially high , when defined according to the assembly of half of the final mass . to avoid such artificially large assembly redshifts , we define @xmath170 of simulated galaxies as the earliest time when half of the maximum mass was assembled , that a single progenitor in the merger tree of given galaxy had at some redshift .",
    "our assumption is that even if dynamical interactions between cluster and galaxy halos take place , they do not significantly affect the very inner regions @xmath172 of interest here . in case of field spirals ,",
    "formation redshifts defined either from the final or from the maximum mass are very similar .    without a baryon correction ,",
    "our estimates of coma galaxy formation redshifts are on average higher than in the semi - analytic models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z_sam]a ) .",
    "this , although ( 1 ) the dark matter densities of ellipticals match with the simulations and ( 2 ) our assumption about the formation redshifts of spirals ( @xmath173 ) is consistent with the simulations .",
    "the origin for the offset between coma galaxies and semi - analytic models in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_sam]a is that the density contrast between halos of ellipticals and spirals is larger in observed galaxies than in the simulations . after applying the baryon correction ,",
    "the coma galaxy formation redshifts become consistent with the simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z_sam]b ) .",
    "this result indicates that the discrepancy between the measured and the simulated density ratio @xmath174 is due to baryon effects .",
    "our coma galaxy formation redshifts are based on the assumption that @xmath175 .",
    "[ fig : rho_zf_sam ] shows @xmath102 versus @xmath176 explicitly .",
    "independent of including a baryon correction or not , the slope of the relationship between @xmath102 and @xmath176 in the coma galaxies is roughly parallel to simulated @xmath5-body halos .",
    "this confirms that our assumption for the scaling between @xmath102 and @xmath170 is approximately consistent with the cosmological simulations .",
    "concerning the absolute values of the dark matter densities it has been already stated above that they are only consistent with the simulations if either the net effect of the baryons is zero in the case of ellipticals or if galaxies do not have maximum stellar masses . the former case would imply that halos of spiral galaxies experience a net expansion during the baryon infall ( several processes have been proposed for this , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite quote a stellar assembly redshift below @xmath177 for simulated ellipticals more massive than @xmath178 .",
    "the halo assembly redshifts in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_sam ] are mostly above @xmath179 . in part , this is due to the fact that we only consider semi - analytic galaxies in high - density environments similar to coma .",
    "in addition , formation redshifts defined according to the stellar mass assembly and the halo assembly , respectively , are not always equal .",
    "for example , in our comparison sample of simulated cluster ellipticals we find an average dark halo assembly redshift @xmath180 for galaxies more massive than @xmath178 .",
    "evaluating for the same galaxies the redshift @xmath181 ( when half the stellar mass is assembled ) yields @xmath182 . that @xmath183 is plausible if some star formation is going on between @xmath184 in the progenitor and/or in the subunits that are to be accreted after @xmath170 .",
    "it should also be noted that the simulations do not take into account stellar mass - loss due to tidal interactions .",
    "we have presented dark matter scaling relations derived from axisymmetric , orbit - based dynamical models of flattened and rotating as well as non - rotating coma early - type galaxies .",
    "dark matter halos in these galaxies follow similar trends with luminosity as in spirals . thereby , the majority of coma early - types  those with old stellar populations  have halo core - radii @xmath11 similar as in spirals with the same @xmath2-band luminosity , but their asymptotic halo velocities are about @xmath96 times higher .",
    "in contrast , four coma early - types  with young central stellar populations  have halo velocities of the same order as in comparably bright spirals , but their core - radii are smaller by a factor of 4",
    ". differences between spirals and ellipticals increase , when the comparison is made at the same stellar mass .",
    "the average halo density inside @xmath0 exceeds that of comparably bright spirals by about a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "if the higher baryon concentration in ellipticals is taken into account , the excess density reduces to about a factor of 3 , but if ellipticals and spirals are compared at the same stellar mass , then it is again of the order of @xmath185 .",
    "our measured dark matter densities match with a comparison sample of simulated cluster ellipticals constructed from the semi - analytic galaxy formation models of @xcite .",
    "these synthetic ellipticals have @xmath186 and higher dark matter densities than simulated field spirals , which are appear on average around @xmath173 .",
    "assuming for local spirals @xmath187 as well , and assuming further that the inner dark matter density scales with the formation redshift like @xmath188 , our results imply that ellipticals have formed @xmath189 earlier than spirals . without baryon correction",
    ", we find an average formation redshift around @xmath190 , which is slightly larger than in semi - analytic galaxy formation models .",
    "accounting for the more concentrated baryons in ellipticals , the average formation redshift drops to @xmath191 .        for about half of our sample ,",
