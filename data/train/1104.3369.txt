    "nanomechanical resonators ( nr ) have been studied in a diversity of situations , as for weak force detections @xcite , precision measurements @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , etc .",
    "the demonstration of the quantum nature of mechanical and micromechanical devices is a pursued target ; for example , manifestations of purely nonclassical behavior in a linear resonator should exhibit energy quantization , the appearance of fock states , quantum limited position - momentum uncertainty , superposition and entangled states , etc .",
    "nr can now be fabricated with fundamental vibrational mode frequencies in the range mhz ",
    "ghz @xcite .",
    "advances in the development of micromechanical devices also raise the fundamental question of whether such systems that contain a macroscopic number of atoms will exhibit quantum behavior . due to their sizes , quantum behavior in micromechanical systems will be strongly influenced by interactions with the environment and the existence of an experimentally accessible quantum regime will depend on the rate at which decoherence occurs @xcite .",
    "one crucial step in the study of nanomechanical systems is the engineering and detection of quantum effects of the mechanical modes .",
    "this can be achieved by connecting the resonators with solid - state electronic devices @xcite , such as a single - electron transistor .",
    "nr has also been used to study quantum nondemolition measurement @xcite , quantum decoherence a7,a13 , and macroscopic quantum coherence phenomena @xcite .",
    "the fast advance in the tecnique of fabrication in nanotecnology implied great interest in the study of the nr system in view of its potential modern applications ,  as a sensor , largely used in various domains , as in biology , astronomy , quantum computation @xcite , and more recently in quantum information @xcite to implement the quantum qubit @xcite , multiqubit @xcite and to explore cooling mechanisms @xcite , transducer techniques a26,a27,a28 , and generation of nonclassical states , as fock @xcite , schrdinger - cat  @xcite , squeezed states @xcite , including intermediate and other superposition states @xcite . in particular , nr coupled with superconducting charge qubits has been used to generate entangled states @xcite . in a previous paper zhou and",
    "mizel @xcite proposed a scheme to create squeezed states in a nr coupled to cooper pair box ( cpb ) qubit ; in it the nr - cpb coupling is controllable .",
    "such a control comes from the change of external parameters and plays an important role in quantum computation , allowing us to set on and off the interaction between systems on demand .",
    "now , the storage of optical data and communications using basic processes belonging to the domain of the quantum physics have been a subject of growing interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "concerned with this interest , we present here a feasible experimental scheme to create holes in the statistical distribution of excitations of a coherent state previously prepared in a nr . in this proposal the coupling between the nr and the cpb can be controlled continuously by tuning two external biasing fluxes .",
    "the motivation is inspired by early investigations on the production of new materials possessing holes in their fluorescent spectra @xcite and also inspired by previous works of ours , in which we have used alternative systems and schemes to attain this goal @xcite .",
    "the desired goal in producing holes with controlled positions in the number space is their possible application in quantum computation , quantum cryptography , and quantum communication .",
    "as argued in @xcite , these states are potential candidates for optical data storage , each hole being associated with some signal ( say yes , @xmath0 , or @xmath1 ) and its absence being associated with an opposite signal ( no , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 ) .",
    "generation of such holes has been treated in the contexts of cavity - qed @xcite and traveling waves @xcite .",
    "there exist in the literature a large number of devices using the squid - base , where the cpb charge qubit consists of two superconducting josephson junctions in a loop . in the present model a cpb",
    "is coupled to a nr as shown in fig .",
    "( [ cooper ] ) ; the scheme is inspired in the works by jie - qiao liao et al .",
    "@xcite and zhou et al .",
    "@xcite where we have substituted each josephson junction by two of them .",
    "this creates a new configuration including a third loop .",
    "a superconducting cpb charge qubit is adjusted via a voltage @xmath4  at the system input and a capacitance @xmath5 .",
    "we want the scheme ataining an efficient tunneling effect for the josephson energy . in fig.([cooper ] ) we observe three loops : one great loop between two small ones .",
    "this makes it easier controlling the external parameters of the system since the control mechanism includes the input voltage @xmath4 plus three external fluxes @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this way",
    "one can induce small neighboring loops__. _ _ the great loop contains the nr and its effective area in the center of the apparatus changes as the nr oscillates , which creates an external flux @xmath9 that provides the cpb - nr coupling to the system .        in this work",
    "we will assume the four josephson junctions being identical , with the same josephson energy @xmath10 , the same being assumed for the external fluxes @xmath11 and @xmath7 , i.e. , with same magnitude , but opposite sign : @xmath12 . in this way , we can write the hamiltonian describing the entire system as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the excitation in the nr , corresponding with the frequency @xmath15 and mass @xmath16 ; @xmath10 and @xmath17 are respectively the energy of each josephson junction and the charge energy of a single electron ; @xmath5 and @xmath18 stand for the input capacitance and the capacitance of each josephson tunel , respectively @xmath19 is the quantum flux and @xmath20 is the charge number in the input with the input voltage @xmath4 .",
    "we have used the pauli matrices to describe our system operators , where the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( or 0 and 1 ) represent the number of extra cooper pairs in the superconduting island .",
    "we have : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25    the magnectic flux can be written as the sum of two terms , @xmath26where the first term @xmath27 is the induced flux , corresponding to the equilibrium position of the nr and the second term describes the contribution due to the vibration of the nr ; @xmath28 represents the magnectic field created in the loop .",
    "we have assumed the displacement @xmath29 described as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the amplitude of the oscillation .    substituting the eq.([a4 ] ) in eq.([a1 ] ) and controlling the flux @xmath27 we can adjust @xmath32 to obtain @xmath33and making the approximation @xmath34 we find @xmath35where the constant coupling @xmath36 and the effective energy @xmath37 in the rotating wave approximation the above hamiltonian results as @xmath38    now , in the interaction picture the hamiltonian is written as , @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] is the evoluion operator . assuming the system operating under the resonant condition , i.e. , @xmath41 , and setting @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 with  @xmath45 the interaction hamiltonian is led to the abbreviated form ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 is the raising ( lowering ) operator for the cpb .",
    "we note that the coupling constant @xmath50 can be controlled through the flux @xmath51 , which influences the mentioned small loops _ _  _ _ in the left and right places .",
    "furthermore , we can control the gate charge @xmath52 via the gate voltage @xmath4 syntonized to the coupling .",
    "it should be mentioned that the energy @xmath53 depends on the induced flux @xmath54 .",
    "so , when we syntonize the induced flux @xmath51 the energy @xmath55 changes . to avoid unnecessary transitions during these changes , we assume the changes in the flux being slow enough to obey the adiabatic condition .",
    "next we show how to make holes in the statistical distribution of excitations in the nr .",
    "we start from the cpb initially prepared in its ground state @xmath56 and the nr initially prepared in the coherent state , @xmath57then the state @xmath58 that describes the intire system ( cpb plus nr ) evolves as follows @xmath59where @xmath60 is the ( unitary ) evolution operator and @xmath61 is the interaction hamiltonian , given in eq .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) .    setting @xmath62  and",
    "@xmath63  we obtain after some algebra ,    @xmath64    in this way , the evolved state in eq.([h ] ) becomes@xmath65 ,   \\label{h1}\\]]where @xmath66 , if we detect the cpb in the state @xmath21 after a convenient time interval @xmath67 then the state @xmath68 reads @xmath69where @xmath70 is a normalization factor .",
    "if we choose @xmath67 in a way that @xmath71 , the component @xmath72 in the eq.([h2 ] ) is eliminated .    in a second step ,",
    "supose that this first cpb is rapidly substituted by another one , also in the initial state @xmath73 , that interacts with the nr after the above detection .",
    "for the second cpb the initial state of the nr is the state given in eq.([h2 ] ) , produced by the detection of the first cpb in @xmath21 . as result",
    ", the new cpb - nr system evolves to the state @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{h3}\\ ] ]    next , the detection of the second cpb again in the state @xmath75 leads the entire system collapsing to the state @xmath76 ,   \\label{h4}\\]]where @xmath77 is a normalization factor . in this way",
    ", the choice @xmath78 makes a second hole , now in the component @xmath79 .    by repeating this procedure @xmath80 times",
    "we obtain the generalized result for the @xmath81 cpb detection as@xmath82where @xmath83 is the @xmath84  cpb - nr interaction time . according to the eq ( [ h5 ] ) the number of cpb being detected coincides with the number of holes produced in the statistical distribution .",
    "in fact the eq ( [ h5 ] ) allows one to find the expression for the statistical distribution , @xmath85 a little algebra furnishes @xmath86to illustrate results we have plotted the fig.([figure1 ] ) showing the controlled production of holes in the photon number distribution .",
    "the success probability to produce the desired state is given by @xmath87note that the holes exhibited in fig.([figure1])(a ) , [ figure1](b ) , and [ figure1](c ) occur with success probability of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "we can take advantage of the this procedure applying it to the engineering of nonclassical states , e.g. , to prepare fock states @xcite and their superpositions @xcite . to this end , we present two strategies :",
    "in the first we eliminates the components on the left and right sides of a desired fock state @xmath91 , namely : @xmath92 @xmath93and @xmath94 in the second one , we only eliminate the left side components of a desired fock state @xmath91 . in both cases",
    ", it is convenient to consider the final state of the nr as , @xmath95which is easily obtained by detecting the cooper pair box in the state @xmath96 .",
    "the success probability @xmath97 to produce a fock state @xmath91 reads @xmath98    in the first strategy , we prepare fock states @xmath91 with @xmath99 , i.e. , the phonon - number @xmath100 coincides with the number of cpb detections @xmath80 .",
    "the fidelity of these states is given by the phonon number distribution at @xmath101  associated with the state @xmath102@xmath103    we note that , in this case the fidelity coincides with the @xmath104 component of the statistical distribution @xmath105 .",
    "the fig.([number ] ) shows the phonon - number distribution exhibiting the creation of fock state @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ; all with fidelity of @xmath109 , for an initial coherent state with @xmath110 .    in the second strategy , we prepare fock states @xmath91 with @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "the associated fidelity is also given by the eq.([ps1 ] ) .",
    "the fig.([number2 ] ) shows the phonon - number distribution exhibiting the creation of fock states @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , all them with same fidelity @xmath113 for an initial coherent state with @xmath110 .",
    "concerning with the feasibility of the scheme , it is worth mentioning some experimental values of parameters and characteristics of our system : the maximum value of the coupling constant @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , with @xmath119 .",
    "_  huang , a16a , a33,a34,b1,b2,bb2,tr , b3_. the expression choosing the time spent to make a hole , @xmath120 funishes @xmath121 @xmath122 when assuming all the cpb  previously prepared at @xmath123 . on the other hand ,",
    "the decoherence times of the cpb and the nr are respectively @xmath124 and @xmath125 @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one may create about 1600 holes before the destructive action of decoherence .",
    "however , when considering the success probability to detect all cpb in the state @xmath21 ,  a more realistic estimation drastically reduces the number of holes .",
    "a similar situation occurs in malboi , ard1,ard _",
    "_ , _ _ using atom - field system to make holes in the statistical distribution @xmath127 of a field state ; in this case , about @xmath128 is spent to create a hole whereas @xmath129  is the decoherence time of a field state inside the cavity .",
    "so , comparing both scenarios the present system is about 60% more efficient in comparison with that using the atom - field system .",
    "concernig with the generation of a fock state @xmath130 , it is convenient starting with a low excited initial ( coherent ) state , which involves a low number of fock components to be deleted via our hole burning procedure . according to the eq .",
    "( [ ps1 ] ) when one must delete many components of the initial state to achieve the state @xmath131 this drastically reduces the success probability . as consequence",
    ", this method will work only for small values of @xmath100 ( @xmath132 ) .",
