    "there is a fundamental limit to the amount of radiation that can be absorbed by a passive system of a given size .",
    "for instance one form of the rozanov limit  @xcite relates the thickness of a planar medium to the bandwidth over which it can be an efficient absorber .",
    "this limit has its origin in the kramers  kronig relations  @xcite , and generally holds for any such _ passive _ system .",
    "however , this does not apply to an active system of currents ; based on some knowledge of the radiation that one is trying to absorb , an active system can eliminate a polychromatic field , even though it might only occupy a small region of space .",
    "this was demonstrated by de rosny and fink  @xcite through placing an active ` drain ' ( a current source driven in reverse ) in the focus of an incoming sound wave , showing that the wave could be concentrated and absorbed within a region of space much less than a wavelength in size .",
    "the use of an active current element to concentrate the electromagnetic field was recently the subject of debate in the context of imaging  @xcite , where it was claimed that the sub - wavelength scale of the field around an active drain could be used to resolve small features of a distant object within the maxwell fish  eye lens .",
    "although it now seems unlikely that a useful imaging device can be made in this way  @xcite , the device proposed in  @xcite has other interesting properties . in particular , tyc and danner  @xcite have shown that absolute optical instruments   tend to have a nearly uniform spacing of eigenfrequencies .",
    "such a spectrum allows one to emit a pulse from a point and then later absorb all the radiation in the device through emitting a second pulse through the same point .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the work of fink and co ",
    "workers  @xcite except that rather than using time reversal of the field to focus it onto the drain , the properties of the spectrum of the device ensure this instead , suggesting a close connection to the phenomenon of wave  packet revival  @xcite .    in this work we demonstrate that the effect noticed by tyc and danner in absolute optical instruments can also be observed in an empty cavity .",
    "we show that within a cubic cavity one can emit a pulse from a point , and then completely reabsorb it at a later time through emitting a second pulse from the same point , or one related by mirror symmetry .",
    "finally , we show an experimental demonstration of this effect .",
    "we begin by recalling the behaviour of a source of electromagnetic radiation in a cavity with perfectly conducting walls . the radiation generated from a time dependent current density",
    "@xmath0 satisfies the inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation @xmath1 this has the general solution @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the volume of space occupied by the cavity , and the electromagnetic green function @xmath4 ( a dyadic ) satisfies @xmath5 the retarded green function can be expanded in terms of the eigenmodes of the system , which in the case of a cavity occur at discrete frequencies @xmath6 , @xmath7 where ` @xmath8 ' indicates a tensor product .",
    "there is also a sum over the polarization degree of freedom which is implicit in ( [ gf ] ) , the details of which can be found in appendix  [ apa ] . in ( [ gf ] )",
    "@xmath9 is an infinitesimal positive number which we take to zero at the end of every calculation , and @xmath10 is the longitudinal part of the delta function  @xcite , which is shown only for completeness and plays no role in the rest of this calculation .",
    "the @xmath11 are the eigenfunctions of the cavity in the absence of any source , @xmath12 normalized such that , @xmath13 it is assumed that the eigenmodes @xmath14 are real valued vector fields .",
    "suppose there is a point  like current @xmath15 located within a cavity , switched on for a time interval @xmath16 .",
    "such a current has the following frequency domain representation , @xmath17 we note that in order for the radiation source to remain uncharged , the net charge transferred to the source must be zero @xmath18 this means that the fourier component of the source at zero frequency must vanish .    when computed from expression ( [ electric - field ] ) , the electric field in the time domain is given as an integral over frequency .",
    "for times prior to the start of the pulse ( @xmath19 ) , the integral over @xmath20 can be replaced with a contour integral closed in the _ upper _ half frequency plane .",
    "the green function ( [ gf ] ) is analytic in the upper half plane and this integral is zero .",
    "we have thus established the obvious fact that the field in the cavity is zero before the current is turned on @xmath21 meanwhile , when @xmath22 , the integral over frequency in ( [ electric - field ] ) may be replaced with a contour integral closed in the _ lower _ half frequency plane . within this contour ,",
    "the green function ( [ gf ] ) has poles at @xmath23 , and an application of the residue theorem along with ( [ jw0 ] ) yields , @xmath24\\label{pulse}.      \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] to obtain ( [ pulse ] ) , we assumed that the current takes a real value in the time domain so that @xmath25 .",
    "the pole at zero frequency , evident in the longitudinal part of the green function ( [ gf ] ) does not contribute , because we have assumed condition ( [ jw0 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ pulse ] ) means that after the current has been switched off ( @xmath22 ) the electric field reduces to a sum over the eigenmodes of the cavity , each weighted by the corresponding fourier component of the source @xmath26 .    due to the dependence of ( [ pulse ] ) on the fourier amplitude of the current at discrete eigenfrequencies of the cavity",
    ", two different current pulses can produce the same final field ; they only have to interpolate the same value at the eigenfrequencies .",
    "this freedom allows us to emit two pulses , with the second pulse serving to completely absorb the first . in the next section we work out the details of this phenomenon",
    "for an ideal cavity with perfectly reflecting walls , the total energy in the electromagnetic field will remain constant after the current pulse @xmath27 has finished . but suppose we want to reduce the energy within the cavity to zero through emitting a second pulse through @xmath28 .",
    "what kind of secondary pulse would be required ?    in the following discussion",
    "we consider the case when @xmath29 and @xmath28 are different points , but a very similar analysis applies when they are the same point  @xcite .",

    "the energy in the cavity is calculated through inserting ( [ expansion - coefficient ] ) into ( [ cavity - energy ] ) .    in order to see the overall change of the energy with time we average @xmath43 over a time window that is assumed long in comparison to the inverse frequencies within the pulse .",

    "the second pulse is of the same shape as the initial pulse but delayed by @xmath101 , which is the time taken for light to travel to the walls of the cavity and back again an odd number of times . the approximation gets worse with increasing @xmath52 due to the fact that the exponential in ( [ x1-current ] ) was found from ( [ approx - zeros ] ) , and the error in this approximation is multiplied by @xmath102 within the exponent .",

    "the theory discussed in section  [ cavsec ] applies to this situation , but for the simpler case of @xmath106 . in this case",
    "one must remove the factor of @xmath67 from ( [ current - condition ] ) , and the phase factor in ( [ box - current ] ) becomes @xmath107 .",
    "the source / drain antenna was attached to an arbitrary waveform generator ( awg ) ( tektronix awg70000 series ) , and the probe was attached to an oscilloscope ( tektronix mso70000 series ) to monitor the field inside the cavity . from the analytic expressions for",
    "the pulse shapes necessary to absorb the field we generated a time series of voltage values which were imported into the awg to generate the pulses .",
    "the awg outputs the desired time domain signal , then starts again at the beginning  we included a long gap of zero output ( @xmath108 ) to let the field in the cavity decay to a small value before emitting the pulses again .",

    "one possible reason for this discrepancy is that we have not included the lifetime of the eigenmodes in our theory ( measured cavity lifetime @xmath110 ) .",
    "it is worth comparing figure  [ exp - fig]b to figure  [ exp - fig]c which differs only in the sign of the second pulse , and shows a much larger cavity field ; in this case the second pulse , instead of extracting the cavity field , adds the same field once more , multiplying the original field by the factor of two and the energy by the factor of four .",

    "we have shown that if a pulse is launched into an empty cavity , then it may be completely absorbed at a later time through launching a second pulse .",
    "the shape of the second pulse is a function of the first one and the eigenfrequencies of the cavity .",
    "in particular , a cubic cavity and a cylindrical one have a particularly simple relationship between the two pulses , and we have verified by direct computation that the cavity energy is reduced to zero . in these cases",
    "the shape of the absorption pulse can be relatively simple and of a duration that is comparable to the initial pulse .",
    "this is thanks to the symmetry of the cavity . for a general cavity shape without such symmetry , the absorption pulse is often incomparably longer than the emission pulse  @xcite .    from figure  [ energy - fig ]",
    "it is clear that the way in which the field energy is reduced to zero can be quite unlike the time reversal operation discussed by de rosny and fink  @xcite .",
