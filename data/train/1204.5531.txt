    "these consonant triads form a complete @xmath1-chain , that is to say , they are an orbit of the subgroup @xmath2 of the neo - riemannian @xmath3-group , formed by iteratively applying @xmath4 then @xmath5 .",

    "the eight - element subgroup @xmath2 acts simply transitively on this set of consonant triads .",

    "this image consists of a maximal cover of the octatonic @xmath8 by 8 elements of the @xmath9-class of @xmath10 ( which we call _ jets _ and _ sharks _ because of their role in bernstein s _ west side story _ ) .",

    "we begin by developing morphisms of generalized interval systems first in an intervallic and then in a transformational context .",
    "we then prove that the categories of generalized interval systems , simply transitive group actions , and groups ( with affine morphisms ) are all equivalent .",
    "we also characterize monic / epic / iso morphisms in the category of generalized interval systems .    in many works of music ,",
    "there are several generalized interval systems upon which analysts draw , each with its own notion of interval and transposition .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a codified way of moving between these systems , so that intervals correspond to intervals and transpositions to transpositions .",
    "for instance , one gis may be contained in another , a situation we discuss in more detail in section  [ sec : sub_dual_groups_and_contextual_groups ] from the transformational point of view .",
    "another situation in which morphisms are useful is with products : each product of generalized interval systems projects to its factors .",
    "morphisms also arise in the context of quotients : if a generalized interval system has a congruence relation on its interval group in the sense of @xcite , then there is a morphism to the quotient gis .",
    "more specifically , the concrete application which motivates our development of gis morphisms is our analysis in section 5 of schoenberg s quartet in @xmath0 minor , as we have briefly sketched in the introduction . in the transformational formulation of generalized interval systems ,",
    "the analysis contains several morphisms .",

    "this inclusion morphism also has its ( 2,1,5)-counterpart , beginning with the 8 trichords in the bottom staff of figure  [ fig : figure6transformationofprcyclenotes ] .",
    "more interesting is the affine map @xmath17 , which is part of a morphism from the simply transitive @xmath16-group action on the chords in figure  [ fig : figure5completerpchain88 - 92 ] to another `` @xmath16''-group action on 8 chords in the @xmath10-class , as pictured in figure  [ fig : figure6transformationofprcyclenotes ] , the piecewide narrative in figure  [ fig : figure7piecewidenarrative ] , and the example of the morphism property in figure  [ fig:77_commutativity ] .",
    "this morphism is even an isomorphism , as @xmath17 is bijective ( see proposition  [ prop : monic / epic_morphisms_for_intervallic ] ) .",

    "_ simple _ transitivity of the @xmath108-action requires another hypothesis , as we see in the following observation .",
    "[ thm : simply_transitive_zm - covers ] let @xmath482 be a subset of @xmath223 and @xmath224 any 3-element subset of @xmath482 . consider the natural mod @xmath225 @xmath9-action on @xmath223",
    "let @xmath108 be any @xmath9-subgroup which preserves @xmath482 as a set and acts transitively on @xmath482 .          in the case of the ocatonic @xmath324 , the only @xmath9-subgroup which both preserves it and acts transitively is its set - wise stabilizer , displayed in equation .",
    "none of its subgroups can act transitively for cardinality reasons .",
    "it suffices to prove that every 3-element octatonic subset @xmath230 with @xmath493 has a trivial @xmath108-stabilizer .",
    "namely , a general 3-element subset @xmath224 of the octatonic has a trivial stabilizer if and only if @xmath494 does for some ( equivalently every ) @xmath206 since @xmath495 , which means that @xmath224 generates a simply transitive cover if and only if @xmath494 does by theorem  [ thm : simply_transitive_zm - covers ] .",
    "the transitivity of @xmath108 on @xmath324 guarantees there exists some @xmath206 with @xmath496 .",
    "we next need to check if @xmath230 is fixed by any of the inversions @xmath502 , @xmath503 , @xmath504 , or @xmath505 . recall that if @xmath506 , the unique inversion which interchanges @xmath177 and @xmath507 is @xmath508 .",
    "our method is to assume @xmath463 interchanges the elements 0 and @xmath507 of @xmath230 , which means that @xmath463 fixes the third element @xmath509 , so @xmath510 , and then show this leads to an equation in @xmath132 which can not be solved in @xmath324 .",
    "we go through all the pairs @xmath511 and @xmath507 which may be in @xmath230 .          the elements 0 and 4 are interchanged by @xmath503 , and @xmath514 implies @xmath515 in @xmath132 , which is @xmath516 in @xmath517 , or equivalently @xmath518 in @xmath517 , which implies @xmath519 or @xmath520 , neither of which is in @xmath324 .",
    "if the trichord @xmath224 has no @xmath9-symmetries , then it of course has no @xmath108-symmetries , and @xmath483 is a simply transitive cover by theorem  [ thm : simply_transitive_zm - covers ] , or by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1(i ) ) .",
    "the converse is not true , so corollary  [ cor : simply_transitive_covers_of_octatonic ] is new , as the following example illustrates .",
    "the chord @xmath526 in the octatonic @xmath324 generates a simply transitive cover by corollary  [ cor : simply_transitive_covers_of_octatonic ] , although @xmath527 is a symmetry of @xmath526 . as above , we denote by @xmath108 the set - wise stabilizer of @xmath324 in equation .",
    "simple transitivity of @xmath108 on @xmath528 does _ not _ follow from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1(i ) ) , since the @xmath9-group does not act simply transitively on its orbit of @xmath526 .",
    "we may view the octatonic set @xmath324 as a _ boundary condition _ which makes unique solutions in equations for transitivity .",
    "for instance , the equation @xmath529 does not have a unique solution in the @xmath9-group ( e.g. @xmath499 and @xmath530 are both solutions ) .",
    "however , the octatonic set specifies the extra condition that we want a solution which preserves the octatonic , and this requirement leads to the unique solution @xmath499 .            the other possibility in this second case",
    "@xmath539 is that @xmath542 .",
    "then @xmath543 , and @xmath263 is the same as @xmath544 then @xmath545 and @xmath546 . combining these last two equations",
    ", we have @xmath547 , which is @xmath548 in @xmath132 , and therefore @xmath549 is 0 , 4 , or 8 .",
    "similarly , from equation we see @xmath550 , which in combination with @xmath545 gives @xmath551 , which means @xmath552 in @xmath132 , and @xmath553 is 0 , 4 , or 8 .",
    "thus we also have @xmath554 , and @xmath555 is of the form @xmath531 for some @xmath532 .",
    "the third possibility for @xmath177 is that @xmath556 . but this argument is exactly the same as the two possibilities in the second case @xmath539 above , since we may simply relabel the elements @xmath507 and @xmath509 to be @xmath509 and @xmath507 .",
