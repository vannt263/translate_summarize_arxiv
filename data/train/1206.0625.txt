    "a discrepancy between observations and simulations of ultra - high energy air showers has been recognized for many years , initially evident as an energy - scale discrepancy between air - fluorescence and surface array experiments .",
    "a discrepancy is also seen between the predicted and observed  attenuation curve \" , plotting some measure of the surface array signal as a function of angle , for a constant intensity cut ( e.g. , for the n highest energy events at the given angle ) .",
    "the discrepancy can be parameterized by a ",

    "so far , efforts to remove this discrepancy by modifying the p - p event generators ( qgsjet , epos , sybill , ... ) have not succeeded to fit both the auger observations and other data .    here ,",
    "we investigate three different examples of  ordinary physics \" that are not included in present event generators , which can increase the signal in a surface array : 1 ) the  cronin effect `` @xcite , 2 ) a systematic deficiency in the production of high @xmath4 particles in ' ' minimum - bias \" event generators like qgsjet compared to event generators like pythia which have been tuned for high @xmath4 @xcite , and 3 ) the possible production of an excess of low - energy pions in the target - fragmentation region due to secondary scattering in the target nucleus .    ,",

    "in the 1970 s , it was discovered that nucleons are not just soft - mush but contain point - like constituents ( now understood to be quarks ) which are responsible for a power - law tail in high @xmath4 exclusive scattering , and in single particle inclusive production at high @xmath4 . as the physics of this phenomenon",
    "was explored experimentally and theoretically , one of the most puzzling discoveries was the  cronin effect \" in which the cross - section for large - momentum transfer inclusive scattering was found to increase strongly with the atomic number of the target and the momentum transfer , compared to the behavior expected from the overall @xmath9 rescaling of the total cross section compared to @xmath0 scattering .",

    "presumably , the cronin effect results from multiple scattering , but it has never been satisfactorily explained theoretically and has not been further explored experimentally .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 on the quark - content of the secondary is particularly fascinating .",
    "the various event generators have different predictions for the production of particles with large @xmath4 . in particlular ,",
    "pythia , which is designed and tuned to describe high @xmath4 particles , predicts a larger signal at high @xmath4 than qgsjet ii .",

    "since current simulations do not include the  cronin effect \" and qgsjet does not produce enough high @xmath6 events even in p - p collisions , more realistic simulations would produce more secondaries at large scattering angle .",
    "a muon originating from a typical production height of 5 km , with a @xmath16 production angle would arrive at 1 km . to estimate the impact of increasing the number of high angle muons , we re - weight the secondaries in a suite of qgsjet simulations , by the factors shown in figs .",
