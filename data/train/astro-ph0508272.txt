    "the problem of the formation and structure of dark matter halos constitutes one of the outstanding challenges of modern cosmogony and structure formation models . the problem is easily formulated as what is the outcome of the collapse and virialization of bound perturbations in an otherwise homogenous and isotropic expanding universe .",
    "this is further simplified by considering only collisionless non - interacting particles , hereafter referred to as dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the resulting collapsed objects are dubbed here as _",
    "this seemingly simple problem does not easily yield itself to an analytical understanding  the problem addressed here in a series of numerical ` experiments ' .",
    "analytical and numerical studies of the collapse and virialization of structures in an expanding universe date to the early times of modern cosmogony .",
    "the only rigorous and exact analytical solution relevant to the problem is that of a single scale free spherical density perturbation in a friedmann universe , the so - called secondary infall model @xcite and its application to cosmological models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "the shortcoming of the analytical approach prompted the study of the formation of dm halos by means of n - body simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "the structure of dm halos inferred from a variety of cosmological models and power spectra of the primordial perturbation field was found to be well approximated by a spherically averaged density profile ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density at the scale radius @xmath2 .",
    "the nfw profile constitutes a universal fit to the structure of dm halos over many orders of magnitudes in mass and at different redshifts .",
    "it has been confirmed by numerous n - body simulations , although some modifications have been suggested ( most notably * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the nfw profile has been studied in the framework of the secondary infall model @xcite and the merger scenario @xcite .",
    "while analytical models necessarily invoke spherical symmetry , simulations emphasize the background asymmetry .",
    "this has led us to embark on a series of numerical experiments carefully designed to shed light on the problem .    in this _",
    "letter _ we address the role of the merging history in shaping up the density profile .",
    "it has been determined that the evolution of dm halos proceeds in two phases , of rapid and slow accretion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the general understanding that has followed is that an nfw structure is quickly established after the rapid phase and is preserved during the slow accretion .",
    "thus it follows that the emergence and evolution of the nfw profile might depend primarily on the mergers epoch @xcite .",
    "this motivates our first study of the formation of dm halos by using constrained simulations .",
    "we design a set of numerical experiments in which a given halo of mass @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the hubble s constant in units of @xmath7 ) is constrained to follow different merging histories .",
    "we then study the different constrained halos and compare the evolution of their density profiles .",
    "the ability to design initial conditions for @xmath0-body  simulations by constrained realizations of gaussian fields is the _ key _ to the ` experimental ' approach used here .",
    "this is done by following the @xcite algorithm .",
    "the design of an experiment starts with the expression of whatever constraints one would like to impose into linear constraints on the primordial perturbation field , which is assumed to be gaussian within the inflation paradigm .",
    "the constrained realization is used to set up the initial conditions by means of the @xcite approximation .",
    "the resulting simulation is referred here as a constrained simulation .",
    "the linear constraints are described in  [ sec : cs ] , the models are presented in  [ sec : model ] and their analysis in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the cosmological implications are discussed in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we used the updated version of the ftm-4.4 hybrid code ( heller & shlosman 1994 ; heller 1995 ) , with @xmath8 .",
    "the gravitational forces are computed using the routine falcon ( dehnen 2002 ) , which is about ten times faster than optimally coded barnes & hut ( 1986 ) tree code .",
    "the gravitational softening is @xmath9  pc .",
    "the addressed issue of the collapse of an individual halo in an expanding friedmann universe has led us to use vacuum boundary conditions and to perform the simulations with physical coordinates . in these",
    "coordinates the cosmological constant , or its generalization as dark energy , should be introduced by an explicit term in the acceleration equation .",
    "the ftm code in its present form does not contain a cosmological constant term .",
    "this has led us to assume the open cdm ( ocdm ) model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the current cosmological matter density parameter and @xmath14 is the variance of the density field convolved with a top - hat window of radius @xmath15 used to normalize the power spectrum ) .",
    "this is very close to the ` concordance ' @xmath16cdm model in dynamical properties .",
    "we are interested here in the dynamical evolution of the density profile and its dependence on the merging history and therefore the results obtained here are valid also in a @xmath16cdm cosmology .",
    "the code was tested in the cosmological context using the santa barbara cluster model ( frenk et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a series of linear constraints on the initial density field are used to design the numerical experiments .",
    "all the constraints are of the same form , namely the value of the initial density field at different locations , and evaluated with different smoothing kernels .",
    "we used gaussian kernels for the smoothing procedure , where the width of the kernel is fixed so as to encompass a mass @xmath17 ( the mass scale on which a constraint is imposed ) .",
    "the set of mass scales and the location at which the constraints are imposed define the numerical experiment .    assuming a cosmological model and power spectrum of the primordial perturbation field , a random realization of the field is constructed from which a constrained realization is generated using the @xcite algorithm .",
    "many different realizations of the same experiment can be performed ( romano - daz  in prep . ) .",
    "a set of five different models ,  experiments , is designed here to probe different merging histories of a given @xmath1 halo in an ocdm cosmology .",
    "this halo is then constrained to have different substructure on different mass scales and locations designed to collapse at different times .",
    "the spherical top - hat model is used here to set the numerical value of the constraints .",
    "the model provides the collapse time of substructures as a function of the initial density .",
    "this is used only as a general rough guide as the various substructures are neither spherical nor isolated .",
    "furthermore , the few constraints used here do not fully control the experiments .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics can in principle affect the evolution in a way not fully anticipated from the initial conditions .",
    "even more important is the role of the random component of the constrained realizations @xcite . thus depending on the nature of the constraints and the power spectrum assumed , the random component can provide other significant substructures at different locations and mass scales .",
    "this can be handled by adding more constraints and varying their numerical values .",
    "our models are designed as follows : model a ( our benchmark model ) is based on two constraints .",
    "one is that of a @xmath1 halo at the origin designed to collapse at @xmath18 .",
    "this halo is embedded in a region ( 2nd constraint ) corresponding to a mass of @xmath19 in which the over - density is zero  a region corresponding to an unperturbed friedmann model .",
    "this is a scale larger by about a factor of three ( in mass ) than the computational sphere and therefore the constraint can not be exactly fulfilled , yet it constrains the large scale modes of the realizations to obey it .",
    "these two constraints are imposed on all other models .",
    "model b adds two substructures of mass @xmath20 within the @xmath1 halo , designed to collapse by @xmath21 .",
    "model c further splits each ones of the @xmath20 halos into two @xmath22 substructures ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , the benchmark halo is design to follow two major mergers events on its way to virialization .",
    "model d takes the model a and imposes six different small substructures of mass @xmath24 scattered within the big halo , designed to collapse at about @xmath25 .",
    "model e attempts to simulate a more monolithic collapse in which a nested set of constraints , located at the origin , is set on a range of mass scales down to @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "all models have been constructed with the same seed of the random field .",
    "all the density constraints constitute @xmath28 perturbations ( where @xmath29 is the variance of the appropriately smoothed field ) , and were imposed on a cubic grid of 128 grid - cells per dimension ( romano - daz , in prep . ) .",
    "we evolve the linear initial density field from @xmath30 until @xmath31 by means of the ftm code .",
    "since we want to follow as close as possible the merging history of our models , we have sampled the system s dynamical evolution with 165 time outputs spaced logarithmically in the expansion parameter @xmath32 .",
    "each halo is resolved at @xmath31 with around @xmath33 particles within the virial radius .",
    "all models differ substantially at early epochs , with a subsequent convergence in some of their properties but not in others .",
    "they lead to the formation of a single object of mass @xmath34 via mergers with the surrounding substructure and with a slow accretion . to analyze the clumpy substructure we define the dm halo(s ) as having the mean density equal to some critical value @xmath35 times the critical density of the universe , where @xmath35 depends on the redshift and the cosmological model .",
    "the top - hat model is used to calculate @xmath36 and the density is calculated within a virial radius ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the halos are identified initially by the hop algorithm @xcite and approximated by means of a radius @xmath37 .",
    "comparison of the hop halos with those of the standard fof halo finder @xcite shows good agreement .",
    "given a group catalog , a merger tree is constructed for each model using all the snapshots .",
    "the evolution toward the final halo is studied by tracking back in time the main branch that leads to this halo . the general picture which emerges",
    "is that of a halo undergoing phases of _ slow _ and ordered evolution intermitted by episodes of rapid mass growth _ via _ collapse and _ major mergers _ , in agreement with previous simulations @xcite .",
    "these are referred to as the quiescent and violent phases .",
    "the structure of a halo is studied by fitting it to an nfw profile ( eq .  [ eq : nfw ] ) and following the cosmological evolution of the nfw parameters , namely @xmath38 .",
    "note , that within a given cosmology and per a given halo of a given mass , only @xmath2  is a free parameter to be fitted .",
    "the fitting algorithm used here is based on logarithmic binning of the halo into spherical shells , and estimating @xmath2  by minimal @xmath39 , where the residual in a given shell is normalized by its own density .",
    "the fitting is performed within @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the distance to the nearest massive halo .",
    "although the spherical symmetry of a nfw model ignores some of the dynamical properties of a halo , we use it as the first approximation to the halo structure .",
    "the nfw profile is found to be a very good fit to the spherically - symmetric density in the quasi - static phases . during the violent phases , such as mergers of two almost equal mass halos or collapse of a few substructures to form a single halo , the halos are out of equilibrium and the nfw fit is only approximate .    the cosmological evolution of @xmath2  and @xmath42  of the main halo for all the models is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the @xmath42trajectories ( the accretion trajectories ) show a regular behavior and a linear growth , separated by sudden increases , all of which are associated with the violent phases .",
    "most strikingly , @xmath2  remains _ constant _ in the quiescent phases and grows _ discontinuously _ in the violent ones .",
    "the @xmath2  is subject to a @xmath43 jitter in the quiescent phases which grows stronger during the violent phases when the halos get out of a dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the scale density @xmath4 shows a similar behavior , but in the opposite sense  remaining constant in the quasi - static phases and decreasing abruptly in the violent ones .",
    "we note that all models , except b , converge to the same value of @xmath2(within the jitter ) at the present epoch of @xmath44 , in spite of the different tracks leading to it . in model b , the two major halos have already turned around but have yet to merge . even before this last merger , @xmath2  is larger than in other models and is expected to grow further .",
    "the present simulations show that there is no clear relation between @xmath4 and the formation time of the halo , as given by the time of the last violent event .",
    "this contrasts with previous claims about such a correlation .",
    "the order of models given by the formation time of their halos is b , e , a , d , and c. all the models have similar @xmath4 except for model c which has a value twice as large ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the evolution of the dynamical state of the main halos has been analyzed in terms of the internal kinetic energy ( @xmath45 ) within @xmath2  and @xmath37 .",
    "any perturbation in the halo s internal state ( violent mass aggregation , random energy acquisition , etc . ) will be reflected in its @xmath45 behavior .",
    "we find that @xmath45 within @xmath2  behaves similarly to @xmath2   remaining constant during the quasi - static stages ( within the jitter ) and growing discontinuously at the violent phases .",
    "this implies a possible direct relation between the internal kinetic energy and @xmath2 .",
    "this has been tested by comparing the relative changes of @xmath45 and @xmath2  ( figure  2 ) , which shows that the larger is the change in @xmath45 the more @xmath2  increases .",
    "( further analysis of this relation is to be presented elsewhere . )",
    "the internal kinetic energy computed within @xmath42shows a similar behavior but grows very slowly during the quasi - static phases .",
    "the halo growth can be divided into the violent and quiescent phases analyzed in our superior time sampled @xmath0-body simulations using constrainted realizations .",
    "this allowed us to show conclusively the details which have been hinted about in the literature so far . in this _",
    "letter _ we focus on the evolution of @xmath2  and @xmath37 leaving more comprehensive analysis for elsewhere ( romano - diaz , in prep . ) .",
    "first , we find that the nfw scale @xmath2  stays constant during the quiescent phase and changes abruptly during the violent one . in contrast , @xmath37 is growing linearly in the quiescent and abruptly during the violent phases .",
    "second , @xmath4 stays unchanged during the quiescent phase and drops abruptly during the violent phase .",
    "third , the value of @xmath2  reflects the violent merging history of the halo , and depends on the number of violent events and their fractional magnitudes , independent of the time and order of these events .",
    "the corollary is that @xmath4 does not reflect the formation time of the halo .",
    "fourth , the fractional change in @xmath2  is a nonlinear function of the fractional absorbed kinetic energy within @xmath2  in a violent event .",
    "we note , that the accretion trajectories in all models converge to the same value .",
    "this is a reflection of the large - scale structure shared by all the models and imposed by the constrained initial conditions .",
    "the advantage of the constrained realizations lies in the unique ability to generate a series of models with one or more parameters varied in a controlled manner , while all others are held fixed .",
    "it allows us to cleanly separate the cause - and - effect relationship between the initial parameters and the outcome of the dynamical evolution .",
    "this complements the prevailing method of large - scale cosmological simulations in which issues of structure and evolution are addressed statistically .",
    "the scaling relations found in such a statistical analysis are not necessarily applicable to an individual halo . here",
    "we focus on the role of the merging history in the halo evolution , by imposing density constraints based on the top - hat model .",
    "we find that the actual history of a halo does not always follow closely the expectations based on the simple top - hat model .",
    "inspite of this the different models provide us with a good laboratory for experimenting with the role of the merging history in shaping the structure of dm halos .",
    "the analogy between the halo evolution and thermodynamical processes has not escaped our attention . equating the quiescent phases with adiabatic processes and",
    "the violent with non - adiabatic ones leads one to associate the behavior of @xmath2  with that of the entropy . in this terminology",
    "the entropy remains constant in the quiescent phase and grows discontinuously in the violent phase ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "also , the accretion trajectories play the role of adiabats and the system jumps from one adiabat to the other by a violent event , not unlike a shock wave .",
    "the question whether this is just a simple analogy or provides a deeper understanding will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "the results obtained here pertain to the one halo studied in the framework of an ocdm cosmology . yet",
    ", the conclusions reached from the set of experiments presented here are relevant to the understanding of halo formation in the general cdm cosmologies and in particular to the ` benchmark ' @xmath16cdm cosmology .",
