    "both photon beams and electron beams can carry orbital angular momentum . in the case of photon beams ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum is carried by the spiral wavefront @xcite .",
    "photon beams that carry orbital angular momentum have important applications @xcite in micro - machines , atom manipulation , and quantum information . in the case of electron beams ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum was also shown @xcite to be carried by the spiral structure of the beam s wavefront when the spin polarization is uniformly distributed .",
    "electron beams that carry orbital angular momentum were generated very recently in experiments @xcite by making use of techniques that are similar to those @xcite used for generating photon beams of orbital angular momentum .",
    "apart from the orbital - angular - momentum photon beams which are approximately uniformly polarized @xcite , another kind of photon beams that are rotationally invariant in polarization , the so - called cylindrical - vector beams @xcite , were also predicted @xcite and experimentally generated @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical - vector photon beams have drawn much attention in diverse areas of application @xcite .",
    "now that the local state of quantum electron waves can be described in terms of the concept of spin polarization @xcite , an much more interesting question arises naturally as to whether there exist electron beams that are cylindrically symmetric in spin polarization . to the best of our knowledge , no theoretical investigations of such electron beams",
    "have been reported .",
    "an electron beam of cylindrically symmetric spin polarization means that it can not be an eigen state of the spin operator in a particular direction , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the vector of pauli matrix and @xmath3 is a fixed unit vector . upon noticing that the cylindrical - vector photon beams are eigen states of the total angular momentum in the propagation direction @xcite ,",
    "denoted as the @xmath0 axis , our aim is therefore to look for free electron beams that are eigen states of total angular momentum in the @xmath0 direction , but not eigen states of @xmath4 . for this purpose , we will follow a method that is similar to the method @xcite for constructing the cylindrical - vector photon beams .",
    "astonishingly , the results of our calculations reveal that so constructed free electron beams have spin skyrmion textures @xcite .    for simplicity only monochromatic beams are considered . the wave function in the position representation , @xmath5 ,",
    "is related to the wave function in the momentum representation , @xmath6 , via @xmath7 in circular cylindrical coordinates , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in non - relativistic quantum frame ,",
    "the hamiltonian of free electrons is @xmath10 when the spin is omitted .",
    "a complete set of mutually compatible observables in the monochromatic case can be chosen to be composed of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the @xmath0 components of the linear and orbital angular momenta , respectively .",
    "the corresponding complete orthonormal set of eigen functions in the momentum representation is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) yields the orthonormal eigen functions in the position representation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath17 .",
    "obviously , the eigen values of @xmath11 are @xmath18 ( we choose @xmath19 ) and the eigen values of @xmath12 are @xmath20 .",
    "they are the scalar non - diffractive beams @xcite in the sense that the probability distribution does not change along with the propagation .    equipped with the scalar basis ( [ basis without spin ] )",
    ", we proceed to construct spinor states that are cylindrically symmetric in spin polarization . in analogy with the case of photon beams ,",
    "there exist two distinct configurations .",
    "the transverse component is either in radial direction or in azimuthal direction .",
    "when the spin is taken into account , the free hamiltonian is @xmath21 .",
    "we first introduce a unit - vector operator that is defined @xcite in terms of @xmath22 and the unit vector @xmath23 along the @xmath0 axis as @xmath24 . in the momentum representation",
    ", it shows up as @xmath25",
    ". then we pay attention to operator @xmath26 .",
    "its normalized eigen spinors corresponding to eigen values @xmath27 have the forms of @xmath28 respectively .",
    "it constitutes a complete set of mutually compatible observables together with @xmath11 and the total angular momentum @xmath29 in the @xmath0 direction . their common normalized eigen functions in the momentum representation",
    "are proven to be @xmath30 the eigen value of @xmath31 is @xmath32 . substituting eq .",

    "they clearly show that ( a ) the transverse component is in radial direction and both the transverse and longitudinal components are rotationally invariant , indicating that the spin polarization is cylindrically symmetric ; ( b ) both the transverse and longitudinal components do not change along with the propagation , so that the beam described by eq . (",

    "it is noted that the expectation of the spin in the state ( [ wave function ] ) vanishes , @xmath72 this result can be understood as follows .",

    "the spin polarization at a cross section of the beam is rotationally invariant about the center and varies smoothly along with the increase of the radius .",
