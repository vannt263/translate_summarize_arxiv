    "the concept of the atom laser  @xcite first entered the scientific literature very close to the time of the production of the first dilute gas bose - einstein condensate .",
    "wiseman and collett proposed that dark state cooling of a thermal atomic could be used to occupy a condensed lasing mode , from which atoms could coherently outcouple .",
    "this concept was refined by ballagh _",
    "et al . _ with a semiclassical analysis of a two component condensate , where the trapped component was coherently coupled to an untrapped component by microwave or radio frequency transitions  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of a pulsed atom laser was reported by mewes _",
    "et al . _ in 1997  @xcite , followed four days later by the observation of interference of condensates released from a double trap  @xcite by andrews _",
    "et al . _ an overview of the early state of the field was given by ketterle in 2002  @xcite . since those early days",
    ", there has been continual progress , with robins _",
    "_ having produced a more recent review of progress  @xcite .",
    "shortly after the concept of the atom laser was developed , theoretical work began on the bose - hubbard model with neutral atoms  @xcite , wherein condensed modes of atoms were trapped in the lowest energy states of an optical lattice .",
    "this model has since been constructed experimentally  @xcite , with measurements of many of the theoretically predicted mean - field effects .",
    "we show here how these two fields can be combined via recent advances in the techniques of configuring optical potentials  @xcite and in the outcoupling of trapped atomic modes utilising either electron beams  @xcite , or optical methods  @xcite , to produce a quantum correlated twin atom laser .",
    "our model uses an inline bose - hubbard trimer , with coherent pumping into the middle well and outcoupling from the two end wells , and is a pumped and damped development of the atomic mode splitter described by chianca and olsen  @xcite and compared to an optical beamsplitter  @xcite .",
    "as we will show in what follows , both the modes in the end wells and the modes outcoupled from them possess non - classical correlations such as entanglement and einstein - podolsky - rosen steering .",
    "squeezing of an atom laser output and quantum correlations in a twin atom laser have also been proposed using a single unpumped condensate as a source , using either the collisional interactions  @xcite or interaction with two - mode squeezed light  @xcite to cause the quantum correlations .",
    "bose - hubbard models with pumping and loss have previously been analysed  @xcite , predicting some interesting physical effects , both in the mean fields and the quantum statistical features .",
    "_ have also analysed triangular dimers and inline chains with dissipation at one well  @xcite , predicting some interesting phenomena .",
    "a variety of different theoretical techniques have been used to analyse these systems , some approximate and some exact .",
    "we have chosen to use the exact mapping of our system onto stochastic differential equations in the positive - p representation  @xcite , which are able to be integrated numerically with no difficulties for this damped system .",
    "our system is as shown in the schematic of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . in order to provide a mathematical description , we begin with the bose - hubbard unitary hamiltonian for the open trimer , @xmath0 , \\label{eq : genham3line}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the bosonic annihilation operator for the @xmath2th well , @xmath3 represents the collisional nonlinearity and @xmath4 is the tunneling strength .",
    "the pumping into the middle well is represented by the hamiltonian @xmath5 which is of the form commonly used for the pumping of optical cavities .",
    "the basic assumption here is that this well receives atoms from a coherent condensate , represented by the c - number @xmath6 , which is much larger than any of the modes we are investigating , so that it will not become significantly depleted over the time scales of interest .",
    "the damping acts on the system density matrix as the lindblad superoperator @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the coupling between the damped well and the atomic bath , which we assume to be initially unpopulated .",
    "if the lost atoms fall under gravity , we are justified in using the markov and born approximations  @xcite .",
    "following the usual procedures  @xcite , we map the hamiltonian and the lindblad term onto a fokker - planck equation for the positive - p function .",
    "this is then mapped onto stochastic differential equations in the it calculus  @xcite , @xmath9 where the @xmath10 are the c - number variables corresponding to the operators @xmath11 in the sense that the averages @xmath12 converge in the limit over a large number of stochastic trajectories to the expectation values of normally - ordered operator products @xmath13 . in general ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are not complex conjugates , with this freedom allowing us to exactly represent quantum evolution using classical c - number variables . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath6 is the coherent pump amplitude from the large reservoir condensate , @xmath8 is the loss rate at wells @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the @xmath18 are gaussian random variables with the correlations @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these equations are solved numerically , taking averages over a large number of stochastic trajectories , of the order of @xmath21 for the results presented herein .    without the random noise terms , the above collapse to three coupled semi - classical equations since the conjugate properties are then preserved .",
    "these are useful for obtaining some semi - classical results , although in general there are no analytical solutions except in the case where @xmath22 , with solutions @xmath23    what the above solutions do tell us is that the phases of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the same , which is also obvious from the symmetry of the system .",
    "the degree of entanglement between these modes will depend on the extent to which their quantum fluctuations are correlated . to calculate this",
    "we need to proceed numerically . for the results given in this paper , we have integrated eq .",
    "[ eq : ppequations ] over at least @xmath21 stochastic trajectories for each parameter set , achieving good convergence of the results .",
    "the fact that we are able to use the positive - p method at all here is due to the damping of the system , without which the equations for a bose - hubbard trimer in that representation are highly unstable .",
    "we have used the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( which sets the time scale ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and values for the coherent pumping amplitude , @xmath6 , of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we found that the higher value of @xmath3 gave stronger quantum correlations , as did increasing @xmath6 .    , @xmath26 , and two different pumping amplitudes .",
    "the solid lines are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are equal , while the dash - dotted lines are @xmath34 .",
    "the classical non - interacting steady - state values are shown by the dotted lines .",
    "@xmath35 is a dimensionless time and all quantities plotted in this and subsequent plots are dimensionless . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhaxnk3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bhaxnk2 ] we show the dynamics of the intrawell populations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for both the pump amplitudes that we have considered .",
    "the semiclassical solutions of eq .",
    "[ eq : ssalpha ] are plotted for comparison .",
    "for the lower value of @xmath3 , we see that these are almost indistinguishable from the quantum solutions after the initial transients . by way of contrast",
    ", for @xmath38 , the non - interacting and interacting solutions are markedly different , and the populations of the middle well become different to and greater than those in the two outside wells .",
    "this effect can be understood by reference to the closed trimer considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which situation the population initially in the middle well does not transfer completely to the two outer wells when @xmath38 for initial populations of approximately @xmath39 atoms . for higher initial populations , which we see in the transients of the middle well occupations in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhaxnk2 ] , the closed system enters a macroscopic self - trapping type regime where tunneling is suppressed . while damping and loss change the details of this process , what we see here does serve to demonstrate that the collisional interactions are having a marked effect on the system .",
    "we also note here that the time axis for @xmath38 is truncated compared to that for @xmath29 because the positive - p equations ran into divergence problems after @xmath40 .",
    ", @xmath26 , and two different pumping amplitudes .",

    "there are a number of quantum statistical properties that we can investigate , including the number statistics , quadrature squeezing , and epr - steering .",
    "we found the number statistics of each well to be less than @xmath41 different from poissonian , which is as expected for a coherently driven and damped system .",
    "the second order equal time normalised intensity correlation functions  @xcite , @xmath42 between the wells are also very close to the coherent state values of one . where we do find a difference from coherent states is in the normalised variance in the number difference between wells @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath43 which has a value of one for two independent coherent states , and a value of zero for two fock states .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fano ] that the difference in number between the end wells is sub - poissonian , and that increasing the nonlinearity or the pump acts to increase the intensity correlation between these two wells . having",
    "shown that the end wells possess what is often called relative number squeezing , we will now proceed to calculate quadrature correlations .",
    ", while the dash - dotted and dashed lines are for @xmath44 .",
    "the two upper ( lower ) lines are for @xmath45 . ]",
    "we define the atomic quadrature operators as @xmath46 so that the heisenberg uncertainty relation is @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known in systems with a kerr - type nonlinearity that the maximum squeezing will occur for @xmath48  @xcite , and we find the optimal angle for our correlations by calculating them at all angles and finding the minima . experimentally this can be done by changing the phase of the local oscillator  @xcite . squeezing in a particular quadrature exists whenever its variance , defined as @xmath49 for any operator @xmath50 , is found to be less than @xmath16 at any angle . in the table below we show the minimum steady - state squeezing values and the quadrature angles at which they are found , for different values of @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "we find that @xmath51 , and that the main factor which affects the squeezing is the collisional nonlinearity , with an increase in this giving better squeezing .",
    "increasing the pumping amplitude has less effect , particularly on the variances of the two end modes .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we now define the correlations we will investigate to detect bipartite mode entanglement .",
    "the first of these , known as the duan - simon inequality  @xcite , states that , for any two separable states , @xmath52 with any violation of this inequality demonstrating the inseparability of modes @xmath53 and @xmath54 . we will call this correlation function @xmath55 .",
    "the violation of this inequality is necessary and sufficient to prove the inseparabilty and entanglement for gaussian states , and sufficient for non - gaussian states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhaxds ] we show the results for this inequality , demonstrating a clear violation in the steady - state . as with the quadrature squeezing",
    ", we find that the increase in collisional nonlinearity allows for a stronger violation , with increases in the pumping having somewhat less of an effect .",
    "this suggests that in any experimental measurement of these correlations , the ratio @xmath56 should be as large as possible .    , and the angles of maximum violation of the inequality in the steady - state , for different values of the pumping and nonlinearities .",

    "this condition is optimal for bipartite gaussian systems , at least sufficient for non - gaussian systems , and also comprehensively demonstrates bipartite entanglement , as such states are a superset of the epr states .    , and the angles of maximum violation of the inequality in the steady - state , for different values of the pumping and nonlinearities .",

    "[ fig : bhaxepr ] , where we see once again that a clearer violation is found for the larger @xmath3 value .",
    "it is of interest to note here that the maximum percentage violation of this inequality ( @xmath61 ) is greater than that for the duan - simon inequality ( @xmath62 ) , and thus may be easier to measure experimentally . having regard to inevitable experimental noise and any small multi - mode effects which we have ignored in our analysis , this may be crucial .",
    "because our system is damped at the two outside wells and the atoms can fall under gravity , we may also examine any correlations in the outputs .",
    "we may treat the system as markovian  @xcite and therefore use the gardiner collett input - output relations , as long as the anharmonicity inside the trap is smaller than the damping rate , which is the case for the lower nonlinearity we have considered  @xcite . since two out of three wells are damped rather than only one out of two  @xcite , we find that the third and fourth order cumulants are insignificant and may closely approximate the system as gaussian . in the steady state",
    ", this then allows us to treat it as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process  @xcite and perform the standard linearised fluctuation treatment of quantum optics on the output modes .",
    "we do not consider this treatment applicable to the system with the higher collisional nonlinearity .",
    "we proceed in exactly the manner followed in a previous analysis of the nonlinear kerr coupler  @xcite , first dividing the variables into mean - value steady - state parts plus fluctuations , e.g. @xmath63 .",
    "the spectral matrix for the fluctuations is defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 represents the steady - state mean of @xmath67 , obtained from the positive - p solutions as in  @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath68 is a @xmath69 matrix with @xmath70 $ ] on the diagonal .",
