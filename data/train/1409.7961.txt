    "the @xmath39 iteration will look like : @xmath40 where @xmath26 - order of diagram @xmath41 , @xmath42 - coefficient near diagram @xmath41 for iteration @xmath43 , @xmath44 means summation over all diagrams of order @xmath41 .",
    "but we need to get limit @xmath45 , so evolution operator looks like : @xmath46 where @xmath47 - asymptotic coefficient .",
    "we could get its value by direct calculation , but we will use some trick here . for r.h.s . with the several homogeneous components",
    "an answer will have the same form , but in the diagrams there will also be forks , corresponding to all homogeneous components of r.h.s .",
    "( in the further text , operators in diagrams would be sometimes referred as the vertices ) .",
    "the trick is that we substitute a solution : @xmath48 in the equation ( @xmath49 - operator of order @xmath22 ) : @xmath33 @xmath50    now , if we compare the coefficients before the same diagrams , we get : @xmath51 where the diagram @xmath41 arises from the operator @xmath49 , to the free edges of which we have contracted @xmath52,@xmath53 ... @xmath54 :     in recurrence for @xmath55,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this formula , we could substitute @xmath56 in the same way , and so on .",
    "we repeat this process , until we come to the trivial diagram , which consists of one identical operator , a coefficient before which is 1 .",
    "thus , the coefficients look like : @xmath57 where product is calculated by the sub - diagrams , which we could get by taking out all sub - trees , which originate from the each vertex , and have the same right , end , edges as @xmath41 .",
    "generally : @xmath58 where @xmath59 - some diagram , which is also constructed from the basic vertexes .",
    "we will use the same notation in the further text .",

    "it is the key formula of this text .",
    "the folloiwng inequality holds for euclidean norm of contraction of two operators : @xmath61    thus , for evolution operator for equation with homogeneous non - linearity of degree @xmath22 we could make an estimation : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "so , we can also estimate a convergence radius of the series : @xmath65{c^p_\\sigma \\parallel d \\parallel^p } } = \\dfrac{1}{\\parallel d \\parallel } \\lim\\limits_{p\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt[p]{c^p_\\sigma}}\\ ] ]    we get coefficients @xmath66 from the one dimensional equation of such kind : @xmath67 @xmath68 after integration , we get : @xmath69 @xmath70{1-\\dfrac{\\alpha x_0^{s-1}}{s-1}t}}\\ ] ] @xmath71 space is one dimensional , therefore : @xmath72    so , all diagrams with the same number of the vertices will have same values . from solution ( [ solution_1 ] ) we could get the coefficients : @xmath73 after substitution of ( [ c_sigma_k ] ) into ( [ convergence_estimation_1 ] ) , we get @xmath74    in the same way we could get estimation for convergence radius for more complicated r.h.s . , which consist of more quantity of the homogeneous components .",
    "difficulty here is , that during the process of calculating of @xmath75 we need to solve algebraic equations of higher degree , to calculate @xmath76 in the one dimensional case .",
    "in this section we consider how , if we know solution for a linear system , to built non - linear perturbations theory over it .",

    "estimations for convergence radius for a non - resonance cases are also presented . as to classical results on dynamic in the neighbourhood of the fixed points see , for example,@xcite or @xcite .      if we decompose r.h.s .",
    "of equation near the not degenerated fixed point , equation gets the form : @xmath77 where @xmath11 - some matrix , @xmath21 - finite degree polynomial .",
    "let s do substitution , which is called in physics an interaction representation : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81    now , let s rewrite it as an integral equation , and iterate : @xmath82 @xmath83 and so on . here , all calculations are on the level of formal series",
    ", a convergence question will be discussed later .",
    "+ so , a solution looks like a sum by all diagrams , where the vertexes connected with exponents - propagators , are orderly integrated by all intermediate times . in case ,",

    "specific of the these series , in compare with the previous one , is that here the indexes inside of the diagram play an important role - eigenvalues in intermediate exponents depend on them .",
    "so , if we want to rewrite answer as a sum over all diagrams , we should sum up by all skeleton diagrams - every vertex corresponds to one component of nonlinear operator @xmath86 only ( for example , @xmath87 and @xmath88 calculated separately ) .",
    "thus , ansatz looks like : @xmath89 where @xmath90 - some coefficients , depending on @xmath91 , @xmath92 - vector , which consists of eigenvalues , @xmath93 . in case ,",

    "let s consider , for simplicity , an equation in @xmath96-dimentional space : @xmath97 generalization is trivial again .",
    "let s look for its solution in the following form : @xmath98 where summation goes by all diagrams , which consist of all monomial operators , e.g. different terms in summation in contraction goes with the different coefficients @xmath99 , @xmath41 - skeleton diagram .",
    "we suppose , that frequencies is not resonance : @xmath100 . here",
    "it is important , that on right side of the diagrams not @xmath101 is contracted , but some coefficients @xmath102 , which are not known , but depended on initial conditions . substituting ( [ ansatz_interaction_rep ] ) in ( [ equation_non_resonance_case ] ) , we get : @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 - unit vector along @xmath106-th axis .",
