    "for many classic spaces ( like @xmath13 ) determining the equilateral dimension is an open problem .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the equilateral dimension of @xmath5-dimensional space equipped with the euclidean norm is equal to @xmath14 , and it is equal to @xmath15 for the @xmath16 norm .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite and @xcite ) that @xmath15 is , in fact , an upper bound for the equilateral dimension of any normed space @xmath4 of dimension @xmath5 . moreover",
    ", the equality holds if , and only if there exists a linear isometry between @xmath4 and @xmath17 .",

    "it is an easy exercise .",
    "for @xmath20 it has been proved by petty and in the case @xmath21 quite recently by makeev in @xcite . for @xmath22 only weaker estimates on the size of a maximal equilateral set are known ( for the best bound at this moment see @xcite ) . in the three dimensional setting even more can be demonstrated .",
    "we have the following    [ tw1 ] let @xmath4 be a real @xmath0-dimensional vector space , equipped with a norm @xmath6 .",
    "assume that @xmath23 form a @xmath2-equilateral set in the norm @xmath6 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath25 in other words , every equilateral set of @xmath0 elements can be extended to an equilateral set of @xmath1 elements .    the main goal of this paper is to give an alternative proof of the theorem of petty , which is obtained in section [ sec:5 ] . in his original reasoning",
    "petty used the two dimensional result called monotonicity lemma ( see section @xmath26 of @xcite ) .",
    "our approach we will be based on the theorem [ nemeth ] of kramer and nmeth .",
    "we cover the required material in section [ sec : prel ] .    to take advantage of the mentioned techniques , we will need to investigate the properties of the circumcircle of an equilateral set in the plane .",

    "such a result have also appeared in @xcite ( see lemma @xmath30 and theorem @xmath31 ) in the case of strictly convex norm , but we give a simple proof .    in section [ sec : example ] , we study an extension of the example given by petty in @xcite . for a given @xmath32 , he has constructed a norm in the space @xmath3 , with the @xmath1-element equilateral set which can not be extended to a @xmath33-element equilateral set ( in other words , it is maximal with respect to inclusion ) .",
    "in particular , theorem [ tw1 ] can not be generalized to higher dimensions . however , the norm given by petty is not smooth and not strictly convex . it is therefore natural to ask , whether the smoothness or strict convexity of the norm would enable us to generalize theorem [ tw1 ] to higher dimensions .",
    "we answer this question negatively in    [ tw3 ] for every @xmath32 there exist a smooth and strictly convex norm @xmath6 in @xmath3 and @xmath34 forming a @xmath2-equilateral set , but there is no @xmath35 such that @xmath36    this improves the example given by petty .    for a survey on equilateral sets in finite dimensional normed spaces , see @xcite .",

    "a ( positive ) _ homothet _ of a set @xmath47 is a set of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are arbitrary .    in the latter considerations we shall use the following theorem of kramer and nmeth , which give a sufficient conditions that a convex body @xmath37 has to satisfy in order to have the following property : every non - degenerated simplex of the space",

    "it is worth pointing out that , while smoothness is necessary , the condition of strict convexity can in fact be dropped , as gromov in @xcite and makeev in @xcite have shown independently later on . for our purposes",
    "however the weaker version of the theorem is sufficient .",
    "it is much harder to guarantee the uniqueness of such inscribed homothet .",

    "an elementary proof can be found in @xcite , section 3.2 .",
    "combining these two results , with @xmath38 chosen as a smooth and strictly convex body in the plane , we obtain    [ wniosek ] let @xmath38 be a smooth and strictly convex norm in the plane . then",
    ", for every non - degenerated triangle , there exists exactly one homothet of @xmath38 passing through its vertices .",
    "a generalization of the proposition [ jedynosc ] to higher dimensions does not hold in the following strong sense : if every simplex in @xmath3 ( where @xmath58 ) has at most one homothet inscribed into a fixed convex body @xmath38 , then @xmath38 must be an ellipsoid .",
    "this characterization of finite dimensional hilbert space was established by goodey in @xcite .    to take advantage of the preceeding results we have to assume smoothness and strict convexity of a norm .",
    "to reduce the general case to such setting , we will use a special kind of smooth and strictly convex approximation .",
    "proof of theorem [ tw3 ] will also rely on this technique .",

    "we begin with a simple    [ lem2 ] let @xmath6 be a norm in the plane and let @xmath66 be a non - zero vector . consider a mapping @xmath67 , defined on the unit disc @xmath68 of norm @xmath6 as @xmath69 then @xmath67 is continuous and bounded by @xmath70 .    indeed , it is easy to see that @xmath67 is bounded by @xmath70 .",

    "as @xmath81 is bounded , it is enough to check that every convergent subsequence of @xmath82 converges to @xmath83 .",
    "so , let us assume that @xmath84 for some subsequence @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath86 we have @xmath87 , by the definition of @xmath67 .    on the other hand , it is immediate to check that @xmath81 is a concave function . as",
    "concave functions defined on the closed intervals are lower semi - continuous we must have @xmath88 . therefore @xmath89 and the lemma is proved .",

    "at the same time , we see that @xmath95 .",

    "the intermediate value theorem implies that on the closed arc of unit circle between points @xmath100 and @xmath101 , there exists point @xmath102 such that @xmath103 for some @xmath104 ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "for such a chosen @xmath102 we have @xmath105 if @xmath53 , then the points @xmath106 are vertices of non - degenerated triangle inscribed into the unit circle , which is a homothet of the triangle with vertices @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , we can circumscribe a circle of a radius @xmath110 on the triangle with vertices @xmath111 .",

    "let us denote @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
