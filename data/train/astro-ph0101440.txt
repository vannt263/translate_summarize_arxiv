    "element abundance patterns in very metal - poor halo field stars and globular cluster stars play a crucial role in guiding and constraining theoretical models of nucleosynthesis@xmath3@xcite . nowhere is this more true than for the case of the neutron - capture processes that are understood to be responsible for the synthesis of the bulk of the heavy elements in the mass region a @xmath1 60 : the s - process and the r - process .",
    "nucleosynthesis theory identifies quite different astrophysical sites for these two distinct processes .",
    "r - process nuclei ( at least the heavy ( a @xmath1 140 ) r - process isotopes ) are _ primary _ nucleosynthesis products , presumed to have been formed in an environment associated with the evolution of massive stars ( m @xmath1 10 m@xmath4 ) to supernova explosions of type ii and the formation of neutron star remnants .",
    "s - process nuclei are understood to be products of neutron captures on preexisting silicon - iron `` seed '' nuclei , occurring both in the helium burning cores of massive stars and particularly in the thermally pulsing helium shells of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . in this picture , the first heavy ( a @xmath1 60 ) elements introduced into the interstellar gas component of our galaxy are expected to have been r - process nuclei formed in association with massive stars , on timescales @xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath7 years @xmath3@xcite .    that the general features of this simple model are correct is confirmed by the finding that r - process contributions dominate the heavy element abundances in extremely metal - poor halo stars . this issue is discussed in the next section .",
    "the implications of trends in the heavy element abundances as a function of [ fe / h ] for the early star formation history of the galaxy and galactic chemical evolution are then examined .",
    "the interpretation of the observed trends in [ ba / eu ] in the context of models of galactic chemical evolution is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the implications of the increasingly pronounced scatter in the ratio of the abundance of r - process nuclei to iron [ r - process / fe ] with decreasing metallicity are explored in section 4 .",
    "evidence of and a possible model for a second ( weak ) r - process nucleosynthesis event@xmath3@xcite are discussed in section 5 .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow .",
    "significant progress in our understanding of the site of operation of r - process nucleosynthesis has followed from studies of the abundances of elements from barium through bismuth in metal - poor stars .",
    "both ground - based@xmath3@xcite and space based@xmath3@xcite observational studies have confirmed that the abundances of the heavy neutron - capture products ( a @xmath1 130 - 140 ) in the most metal deficient halo field stars and globular cluster stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -2.5 ) were formed in a robust r - process event .",
    "this is most clearly reflected in the abundance pattern for the ultra metal poor ( [ fe / h ] = -3.1 ) , but r - process enriched ( [ r - process / fe ] @xmath8 30 - 50 ) , halo star cs 22892 - 052@xmath3@xcite shown in figure 1 .",
    "note the truly remarkable agreement of the elemental abundance pattern in the region from barium through bismuth with the solar system elemental pattern .",
    "@xcite ]    it is also important to recognize that this detailed level of agreement of the metal - poor star heavy element abundance pattern with ( solar system ) r - process abundances is a feature of all studied stars of [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -2.5 . the heavy element abundance patterns for the two stars cs 22892 - 052@xmath3@xcite and hd 115444@xmath3@xcite are compared with the solar system r - process abundances in figure 2 .",
    "the robustness of the r - process mechanism operating in the early galaxy is reflected in the close agreement of these two stellar patterns ( which represent the nucleosynthesis products of , at most , a relatively small number of earlier stars ) with the solar system r - process pattern ( which represents the accumulated production of r - process elements over billions of years of galactic evolution ) .",
    "note the extraordinary agreement with solar system r - process abundances over this range , for the eighteen elements for which abundance data is available .",
    "these data provide conclusive evidence for the operation of an r - process at the earliest galactic epochs that synthesizes the heavy r - process nuclei ( barium and beyond ) , including the long lived isotope @xmath9th critical to dating .",
    "the identification with massive stars seems compelling , although it is possible that neutron star mergers rather than a supernova environment may be responsible .",
    "studies of the time history of the heavy ( neutron capture ) elements have historically been driven by observations .",
    "early trends in the s - process element patterns as a function of [ fe / h ] , noted by pagel@xmath3@xcite , motivated theoretical consideration of such trends in the context of models of galactic chemical evolution@xmath3@xcite .",
    "the great increase in abundance data for metal - poor stars over the past decade has similarly motivated considerable theoretical activity @xmath3@xcite . the ratio [ ba / eu ] , which reflects the ratio of s - process to r - process elemental abundances , is displayed in figure 3 as a function of [ fe / h ] , for a large sample of halo and disk stars from the survey by burris _",
    "et al._@xmath3@xcite .",
    "note that at the lowest metallicities the [ ba / eu ] ratio is consistent with that for pure r - process matter .",
    "the subsequent increase in the [ ba / eu ] ratio with increasing [ fe / h ] ( i.e. increasing time ) to its solar value reflects the input to the interstellar medium of the products of s - process nucleosynthesis in intermediate mass stars of lifetimes greater than those of the massive star sites of r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "this data provides important clues to the history of s - process and r - process nucleosynthesis over the course of galactic evolution .    , which reflects the ratio of s - process to r - process elemental abundances , is displayed as a function of [ fe / h ] for a large sample of halo and disk stars@xmath3@xcite ]",
    "r - process abundances in low metal stars also provide an important further clue to the nature of the r - process site .",
    "the ratio [ r - process / fe ] is displayed as a function of [ fe / h ] for a large sample of halo and disk stars@xmath3@xcite in figure 4 .",
    "the increasing level of scatter of this ratio with decreasing metallicity , most pronounced at values below [ fe / h ] @xmath10 -2.0 , makes clear that not all early stars are sites for the formation of both r - process nuclei and iron . in the absence of other sources for either iron peak nuclei or r - process nuclei in the early galaxy ,",
    "this scatter is consistent with the view that the r - process operates in only a small fraction ( @xmath10 1/10th to 1/50th ) of the massive stars that produce iron @xmath3@xcite .",
    "note again that this refers _ only _ to the nucleosynthesis sites for the heavy r - process isotopes ( barium and beyond ) , and not to any possible site for the production of the lighter r - process nuclei .",
    "is displayed as a function of [ fe / h ] for a large sample of halo and disk stars@xmath3@xcite ]    the scatter in the @xmath11/fe trend is itself interesting and can teach us much about the formation of the first supernovae and their spatially _ inhomogeneous _ enrichment of the halo stars .",
    "the scatter has been studies in detailed models , by ishimaru & wanajo@xmath3@xcite , raiteri et al.@xmath3@xcite , and argast et al.@xmath3@xcite .",
    "the essence of what is going on is captured in a simple , stripped - down model we have constructed for the enrichment of the halo stars .",
    "the @xmath11-process abundance data in extremely metal poor ( i.e. , low [ fe / h ] ) stars drives the model assumptions in a fairly direct manner .",
    "namely , ( 1 ) from low metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath12 or less , we conclude that each star samples only a few ( perhaps only one or two ? ) nucleosynthesis events ( audouze & silk@xmath3@xcite ; see also wasserburg , these proceedings ) .",
    "( 2 ) the low metallicities also imply short - lived progenitors of both the fe and @xmath11-process observed ; we will refer to these progenitors as supernovae , though ns - ns binaries are also possible@xmath3@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) from the large scatter in observed @xmath11/fe , we infer that not all supernovae make both the ( heavy ) @xmath11-process and iron .",
    "( 4 ) finally , from the stunningly solar ratios _ among _ the different @xmath11-process elements within single stars ( see , e.g. , our figure 2 ) , we conclude that the @xmath11-process is _ universal_i.e . , the events that produce the @xmath11-process always closely reproduce the solar system r - process pattern .",
    "we therefore posit that there are two populations of supernovae , one of which yields mostly the heavy ( a @xmath1 140 ) @xmath11-process isotopes ( more specifically , a high @xmath11/fe ratio ) , while the other yields iron ( i.e. , a low @xmath11/fe )",
    ". the @xmath11/fe yield of each population is a parameter , but is constrained by the data which sets a lower limit on @xmath13 , and an upper limit on @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , an additional and key constraint comes from the fact that , averaged over many events of both types , the final @xmath11/fe ratio has to be that which is observed at [ fe / h ] = -1 ( the highest metallicity at which fe is not contaminated by type ia supernova debris ) .",
    "this ratio , @xmath15 sets the fraction @xmath16 of high @xmath11/fe events , since @xmath17 .",
    "also , for simplicity we assume that each supernovae of either population produces the same iron yield .",
    "our model then consists of a monte - carlo simulation of halo - star enrichment by supernovae . for each star",
    ", we impose a total number @xmath18 of supernova ancestors ; this fixes the [ fe / h ] for the star .",
    "of these , the numbers of high and low @xmath11/fe progenitors are taken to be random variables .",
    "this is meant to encode the stochastic and inhomogeneous nature of the halo .",
    "thus , a star s supernova antecedents are chosen from a binomial distribution , whose means are the expected values @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; this fixes @xmath11/fe for the star .",
    "the poisson noise in the high / low ancestry leads to scatter in @xmath11/fe , which scales as @xmath21 and thus increases with decreasing fe / h , as observed .",
    "the results of a typical run are shown in figure 5 , which also shows the observed scatter .",
    "we see that this very simple model nicely accounts for the scatter simply by allowing for stochastic , inhomogeneous mixing of the @xmath11-process and iron from two populations .",
    "/fe as a function of iron abundance . _ upper panel _ : monte carlo simulation , upper limits indicated as points at [ @xmath11/fe ] = -2 . _",
    "lower panel _ : observed data . in both cases ,",
    "the dashed curves indicate the model prediction of the 1-@xmath22 envelope in the scatter . ]",
    "recently , sneden _",
    "et al._@xmath3@xcite obtained detections of six new elements in the relatively unexplored elemental regime from z = 4148 in cs 22892052 .",
    "these data are displayed in our figure 1 .",
    "note particularly that the close agreement of the abundance pattern for the heavier n - capture elements with the solar system r - process pattern does not extend to the lighter elements , _",
    "e.g. the region below ba_. this suggests that , perhaps , a second r - process site may be required .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there exists evidence for a second , weak r - process component from another source .",
    "wasserburg , busso , & gallino@xmath3@xcite have pointed out that the abundance levels of the short - lived isotopes @xmath23pd and @xmath24i in primordial solar system matter are inconsistent with their having been formed in uniform production together with the heavy r - process radioactivities ( specifically , @xmath25hf , @xmath26u , @xmath27u and @xmath9th ) .",
    "they suggest that these two different mass ranges of nuclei require different timescales for production and therefore suggest two distinct r - process sites .",
    "this seems entirely compatible with the weak ( a @xmath28 130 - 140 ) and main ( a @xmath29 130 - 140 ) r - process components as we have identified them above .",
    "the appearance of r - process nuclei in the oldest known stars in our galaxy strongly suggests the identification of the site of the main r - process component ( a @xmath1 130 - 140 ) with massive stars and associated type ii supernova environments .",
    "we note that the three mechanisms currently considered for the r - process are all associated in some way with this environment .",
    "this includes nucleosynthesis associated with : ( i ) neutrino - driven winds from forming neutron stars@xmath3@xcite ; ( ii ) neutron star mergers@xmath3@xcite ; and ( iii ) magnetic jets from collapsing stellar cores@xmath3@xcite .",
    "an alternative possible site for r - process synthesis is that associated with the helium and carbon shells of massive stars undergoing supernovae@xmath3@xcite .",
    "shock processing of these regions can give rise to significant neutron production via such reactions as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , involving residues of hydrostatic burning phases .",
    "the early studies cited above were motivated by the desire to produce the entire range of r - process nuclei through uranium and thorium .",
    "it was found , however , that this could be accomplished only with the use of excessive and quite unrealistic concentrations of e.g. @xmath33c@xmath3@xcite .",
    "c(@xmath34,n)@xmath35o neutron exposures in the helium shell of a massive star are compared with the solar system r - process abundance distribution ( solid line ) . ]",
    "the observational and theoretical considerations discussed previously serve to ease these demands : we need now only to be able to produce the r - process nuclei in the mass range through a @xmath8 130 - 140 . guided by stellar models for massive stars at the end of their hydrostatic evolution@xmath3@xcite",
    ", we have calculated the r - process history of matter processed through the shock heated helium shell for two choices of the initial abundance of @xmath33c : x@xmath36=0.1 and 0.01 .",
    "the initial ( post shock ) temperature and density were taken to be 7x10@xmath7 @xmath37k and 10@xmath38 g / cc , respectively .",
    "here we have assumed an active @xmath33c(@xmath34,n)@xmath35o neutron source acting on a preexisting solar abundance pattern as seed nuclei , and calculated nucleosynthesis occurring on an expansion time scale .",
    "( we note that we might also expect important contributions from the @xmath31 and @xmath32 reactions . )",
    "the results are displayed in figure 6 , where the calculated abundance patterns for the two choices of x@xmath36 are compared with the solar system r - process pattern .",
    "we note that for the more realistic case of x@xmath36=0.01 , the element abundance enrichments fall sharply in the range a @xmath1 130 .",
    "the r - process products formed under these conditions are thus confined to the light mass region that seems not to receive significant contributions from the main r - process component .",
    "r - process abundances in low metal stars provide several important clues to the nature of the r - process site :    * r - process synthesis of a @xmath1 130 - 140 isotopes happens early in galactic history@xmath3@xcite , prior to input from agb stars to the abundances of heavy s - process isotopes . * the chemical evolution of the main sources of s - process and r - process nuclei is reflected in the evolution of [ ba / eu ] with respect to [ fe / h ] , shown in figure 3@xmath3@xcite .",
    "the stellar data indicate that , at metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -2.5 , the abundance pattern of the heavy _",
    "n_-capture products is consistent with purely _",
    "r_-process nucleosynthesis production .",
    "_ s_-process contributions are first seen in some stars at metallicities as low as [ fe / h ] @xmath10 -2.75 , and are observed in most stars with metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath39 -2.3 .",
    "this identifies the delayed entry of ba from the low mass agb stars that represent the site of operation of the main _",
    "s_-process component , on a timescale @xmath10 10@xmath40 years .",
    "* the observed scatter in the ratio [ r - process / fe ] is quite large at low metallicities@xmath3@xcite , while at high metallicities it essentially disappears .",
    "we have shown that this behavior can be understood as a reflection of the increasing level of inhomogeneity of galactic matter at earlier epochs . *",
    "the r - process mechanism for the synthesis of the a @xmath1 130 - 140 isotopes ( which we will refer to as the ` main ' component ) is extremely robust .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the abundance patterns in the most metal deficient ( oldest ) stars , which may have received contributions from only one or a few r - process events , are nevertheless entirely consistent with the r - process abundance pattern which characterizes solar system matter .",
    "( the abundance patterns for the two stars cs 22892 - 052@xmath3@xcite and hd 115444@xmath3@xcite shown in figure 2 reveal this remarkable agreement for two stars of low metallicity but high [ r - process / fe ] . )",
    "* the abundance pattern in the mass regime below a @xmath8 130 does not exhibit this consistency .",
    "it is the source of these lighter r - nuclei ( the ` weak ' component ) that we have sought to identify in our very preliminary survey of r - process nucleosynthesis conditions in the helium and carbon shells of type ii supernovae@xmath3@xcite . *",
    "our numerical results confirm that the helium and carbon layers of massive stars , when subjected to outgoing shocks characteristic of type ii supernovae , can represent an important nucleosynthesis site - specifically for the light r - process nuclei .",
