    "only about 10% of quasars found in optical flux - limited samples exhibit broad absorption lines , resonance line absorption troughs extending @xmath0 to the blue of the emission line centers ( weymann et al .",
    "because in most other respects broad absorption line quasars ( balqso s ) are quite similar to ordinary quasars , it is generally thought that rapidly - moving absorbing matter exists in _ all _ quasars , but occupies only a fraction of the solid angle around them ( weymann et al .",
    "the fact that the remaining light in the troughs is often strongly polarized indicates that the obscuration is not randomly distributed around the quasar in a statistically spherically symmetric manner , but is instead strongly aspherical .",
    "equatorial wedges are the most popular geometry used to explain the observations ( goodrich & miller 1995 ; cohen et al .",
    "1995 ; brotherton et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "quasars are also likely to be anisotropic in their intrinsic continuum emission .",
    "the most plausible source for the photons they produce in the rest - frame optical and ultraviolet bands is an accretion disk , although detailed models for this emission are not altogether successful ( see blaes 1998 and krolik 1998 for reviews ) .",
    "while the specific character of the intrinsic angular radiation pattern is highly model - dependent , in virtually every model the anisotropy is significant . typically , the wavelength range around 1000 ",
    "2000   is limb - darkened , while shorter wavelengths , produced closer to the black hole , are limb - brightened ( sun & malkan 1989 , laor & netzer 1989 , agol 1997 ) .",
    "if the orientations of the intrinsic radiation pattern and the absorbing matter are correlated , optical flux - limited samples will be biassed with respect to the detection of balqso s ( cf .",
    "goodrich 1997 , who suggested that there is bias due to extra attenuation on the lines of sight through the absorbing matter ) .",
    "this effect is strengthened by the steepness of the quasar counts distribution .",
    "for example , suppose that the differential source count distribution _ if quasars radiated isotropically _",
    "were @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of quasars per sky solid angle with flux greater than isotropic flux @xmath3 .",
    "then the distribution per cosine of the viewing angle is @xmath4 .",
    "if we now allow for anisotropy by setting @xmath5 ( implicitly assuming that the angular radiation pattern is independent of all other quasar characteristics such as luminosity or redshift ) , the differential source count distribution that we would actually observe is @xmath6    for optical fluxes in the neighborhood of @xmath7  17 , @xmath8 ( hartwick & schade 1990 ) . since a quasar is only called a balqso if it is found within an equatorial wedge defined by @xmath9 , the bal fraction in a flux - limited sample is @xmath10 thus , if quasars are dimmer in the bal direction , their population fraction at fixed _ observed _ flux is diminished because they are submerged in the larger population of intrinsically fainter non - bal quasars .",
    "as already remarked , we can not compute @xmath11 with great confidence .",
    "however , two plausible guesses will illustrate the possible magnitude of its effect .",
    "the first guess is the simplest possible model : that the local limb - darkening is given by the form appropriate to a gray atmosphere in the eddington approximation ( mihalas 1978 ) , but that the integrated flux is further multiplied by a factor of @xmath12 because the radiation comes from a flat disk",
    ". then @xmath13 . as a foil to this form",
    ", we use a rough analytic fit to detailed radiation transfer calculations which also include a complete treatment of general relativistic corrections ( e. agol , private communication ) .",
    "this analytic fit is @xmath14 .",
    "the predicted bal fractions are shown in fig .",
    "1 . generically ,",
    "_ any _ significant limb - darkening in the direction of the absorbing matter leads to a very strong bias against the discovery of balqso s . in order to find @xmath15 balqso s in an optical flux - limited sample of limb - darkened sources ,",
    "the true covering fraction @xmath16 . when @xmath17 exceeds @xmath18 , the fraction of balqso s discovered in a flux - limited sample rapidly approaches unity as the limb - darkening weakens and the fraction of non - balqso s falls .",
    "conversely , if the absorbing matter is correlated with the _ bright _ direction , the true fraction might be substantially less than the fraction inferred from flux - limited samples .    to 4.5 in this picture",
    "also has one more corollary regarding the bal fraction : if the absorbing matter is in the dim direction , the very faintest quasars ( i.e. those at flux levels where @xmath19 falls below unity ) should be disproportionately balqso s .",
    "if the true covering fraction of absorbing matter is as large as would be predicted if the dim continuum direction is correlated with the direction in which absorption is found , our picture of quasars changes substantially .",
    "the outward flow of matter moving at @xmath0 is no longer a small effect present in only a limited solid angle ; it is , rather , a major element of the system , carrying substantially greater amounts of momentum and energy .",
    "moreover , the velocity is no longer directed only within a small range of directions close to the surface of the accretion disk ; there are fluid elements moving at very substantial angles relative to the disk surface .",
    "these considerations are likely to change our approach in dynamical studies of the bal material .    beyond these dynamical issues",
    ", there are also a number of phenomenological consequences to this changed point of view",
    ".      for only one balqso , phl 5200 , has an x - ray spectrum of good enough quality to determine an absorbing column been obtained ; in this instance it is @xmath20  @xmath21 ( mathur et al .",
    "however , it has been possible to show statistically that most balqso s are relatively weak in the soft x - ray band relative to their optical / ultraviolet flux .",
    "interpreted as the result of absorption , the depression corresponds to columns @xmath22  @xmath21 ( green & mathur 1996 ) .    if the fraction of balqso s is nearer 0.5 than 0.1 , and absorbing columns @xmath23  @xmath24  @xmath21 thick are a generic feature of balqso s , the number of quasars turned up in x - ray surveys sensitive to rest - frame photon energies greater than a few kev should increase by roughly a factor of two relative to the number found by soft x - ray surveys .",
    "anisotropy in the x - ray emission is likely to be rather weaker than in the ultraviolet , but if present could modify this prediction .",
    "these new quasars should have hard x - ray spectra at rest - frame energies 1  5  kev ( as a result of the absorption ) , and most of them should also show bal features in their rest - frame ultraviolet spectra .",
    "interestingly , the asca source count distribution shows exactly this effect : the number of sources seen by asca with fluxes @xmath25  @xmath26  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath27 in the 2  10  kev band is several times as great as the number that would be predicted on the basis of the corresponding rosat counts if the sources had conventional quasar spectra ( cagnoni et al .",
    ". some of these may be agn obscured by dusty tori as in seyfert galaxy unification models ( madau et al .",
    "1994 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) , but others may be balqso s .",
    "as already discussed by goodrich ( 1997 ) , a reduction in the optical flux of balqso s _ increases _ their ratio of radio to optical flux .",
    "he found that the ( rough ) statistics of known balqso s indicated that their optical flux had been depressed relative to the mean of all quasars by a factor of 3  5 .",
    "more precisely , we wish to compute the ratio of radio flux ( preferably extended radio flux , so that it is isotropic ) to observed optical flux for quasars found in optically - selected samples , i.e. at fixed observed optical flux . if the radio flux @xmath28 , then for a single quasar , the ratio of observed radio flux to observed optical flux is @xmath29 .",
    "averaging over viewing angle at fixed @xmath30 , the mean radio to optical ratio for balqsos is @xmath31\\partial^2 n / \\partial f_{obs } \\partial \\mu",
    "\\over \\int_{0}^{\\mu _ * } \\ , d\\mu \\ , \\partial^2 n / \\partial f_{obs } \\partial \\mu } =   r { \\int_{0}^{\\mu _ * } \\ , d\\mu \\ , f^{\\alpha-2 } ( \\mu )",
    "\\over   \\int_{0}^{\\mu _ * } \\ , d\\mu \\ , f^{\\alpha-1 } ( \\mu)},\\ ] ] so that @xmath32 if either of the two models for @xmath11 used in  1 is assumed with a value of @xmath17 that gives an observed bal fraction of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is enhanced relative to the mean ratio for all quasars by @xmath35 .",
    "many people have thought about possible contributions to the broad emission lines due to resonance scattering in bal gas ( surdej & hutsemekers 1987 ; turnshek 1988 ; hamann et al .",
    "1993 ; hamann & korista 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , some ( e.g. turnshek 1988 and hamann et al . 1993 ) have tried to limit the covering fraction by constraints on these contributions .",
    "however , several special features arise in this model , which change the character of these arguments : the large covering fraction enhances the magnitude of the scattering contributions , although the limb - darkening partially counteracts this ; and the width of the scattered line is diminished both by the preference for discovering face - on quasars , and by the relatively greater equivalent width of the intrinsic emission line as seen by the scattering gas .",
    "if we consider an isolated resonance line ( e.g. civ  1549 ) , the limb - darkening by itself can modulate the equivalent width of the intrinsic emission line by factors of several ( as would similarly occur for isolated non - resonance lines such as h@xmath36 or ciii ]  1909 ) .",
    "however , the combination of scattering and absorption diminishes the range of observed emission equivalent widths .",
    "scattering increases the equivalent width of emission lines seen from the polar direction , which would otherwise be the direction in which the equivalent width was least , while absorption , of course , removes line flux from the equatorial direction .",
    "the quantitative character of these effects depends strongly on details of the geometry and kinematics .",
    "it matters whether the emission region is very small compared to the absorption region , or nearly fills it .",
    "the scattered line profile also depends on the velocity gradients within the scattering gas , and on the direction of the flow ( helical outflow , as predicted by murray et al .",
    "1995 , has different properties from radial , for example ) .    to qualitatively explore scattering effects , consider an extremely simplified model",
    ": suppose that the emission line region is far inside the absorption region , the velocity of the absorbing gas is purely radial , and the absorbing gas is black across some range of velocities @xmath37 , but transparent otherwise . with these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "the scattered luminosity in the direction @xmath38 is @xmath39 where primed quantities refer to the intrinsic spectrum .",
    "photons of initial frequency @xmath40 and direction @xmath41 are scattered with probability @xmath42 into direction @xmath38 and frequency @xmath43 by material with speed @xmath44 , defined by the pair of equations @xmath45 for rest - frame resonance frequency @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath16 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48  0.1 , the observed emission equivalent width of an isolated resonance line seen in a non - bal direction is typically enhanced by a few tens of percent relative to what it would be without scattering , and ranges over roughly a factor of two from the polar to the equatorial directions .",
    "part of this enhancement in equivalent width is due to low broad wings .",
    "depending on how the equivalent width is measured , in practise only a portion of these wings may actually be counted towards the emission line equivalent width , with the rest absorbed into the apparent continuum .",
    "interestingly , if the maximum velocity in the absorbing gas is @xmath0 , the extent of the wings is comparable to the extent of the  very broad line \" component identified by brotherton et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "if attention is restricted to the red half of the emission line , this model predicts a greater contrast between bal and non - bal quasars . the emission equivalent width in balqsos should be some 50% stronger , on average , than similar lines in unabsorbed quasars .",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found no strong differences between the emission - line properties of quasars with and without broad absorption ; however , the dispersion of properties in each sample is large .",
    "an additional effect that might mask possible differences is that the intrinsic emission might be blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of the quasar , so that non - balqso s appear to have greater red - side flux .",
    "investigation of such effects will have to await more sophisticated modelling of line profiles in limb darkened balqsos .",
    "the ratio of the absorption equivalent width to the emission equivalent width is sometimes taken as an indicator of the intrinsic covering fraction because scattering by itself would result in these being equal if the covering fraction were unity ( e.g. hamann et al . 1993 ) .",
    "it is , of course , reduced by any true emission .",
    "the observed range of this ratio in balqso s is @xmath49  0.5 , with a median value @xmath35 ( hamann et al . 1993 ) . in the simple model defined in the preceding paragraph",
    ", this ratio also depends on both the intrinsic emission equivalent width and the range of velocities in the absorbing matter , decreasing for greater intrinsic equivalent width and increasing for increasing @xmath50 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "it is 2  4 when @xmath51 and @xmath52  0.015 .",
    "hamann et al .",
    "( 1993 ) argued that if the covering fraction of scattering gas were large , the resulting emission line profile ( in the non - bal view ) would be too broad .",
    "however , if the intrinsic emission line flux is originally isotropic while the continuum radiation is limb - darkened , this story changes . a wind in an equatorial wedge with a covering factor of 0.5 can intercept half of the isotropic line photons while intercepting a much smaller fraction of the limb - darkened continuum .",
    "the scattered c  iv profile that results is then not much broader than the original line because the contribution from scattered line photons dominates that from scattered continuum photons .",
    "scattering in the radial outflow can only _ reduce _ a photon s frequency in the rest frame of the photon source .",
    "we have explored this effect using the very simple model of scattering described above .",
    "suppose , for example , that the absorption profile is generated by pure isotropic scattering , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "let us further assume that the continuum limb - darkening is given by @xmath55 , and that the intrinic c  iv emission line , emitted by a point source at the center , is gaussian with a dispersion of @xmath56 and peak - to - continuum ratio of 1.5 when viewed along the pole .",
    "the resulting c  iv profile , when viewed over a variety of non - balqso lines of sight , has a fwhm of @xmath57 , a peak - to - continuum ratio @xmath58 , and a shape parameter @xmath59 .",
    "all these numbers compare favorably with the c  iv line - shape parameters measured by wills et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for quasars in the same redshift range as the bulk of the weymann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) sample .",
    "the red sides of the model c  iv balqso profiles have similar shapes but somewhat higher peak - to - continuum ratios ( @xmath60 ) because the continuum is substantially limb darkened .",
    "the pair of lines l@xmath19 and nv  1240 is a special case . because the absorbing gas sees the intrinsic emission _",
    "red - shifted _ , and the intrinsically strong l@xmath19 emission line is blueward of nv  1240 by only @xmath61  km  s@xmath27 , the flux available to scatter in the nv feature is substantially magnified relative to the pure continuum .",
    "for this reason , scattering can increase the nv  1240 emission equivalent width by factors of several ( surdej & hutsemakers 1987 ) , provided that the covering factor @xmath62 ( hamann et al . 1993 ) .    to quantify this effect , we again use the simple model already described . in this case , because nv  1240 and ly@xmath19 are always blended , one can not measure the equivalent width of the observed nv  1240 line by integrating across the profile after subtracting off a fixed continuum level .",
    "instead , we defined the flux in each of the two lines by a least squares fit to a model of two gaussians , one centered at 1240 , the other at 1216 .",
    "specific numbers for the relative strength of the apparent nv emission due only to scattering depend on parameters , but only weakly . for @xmath54 , limb - darkening law @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath48  0.1 , and l@xmath19 equivalent width from 40  140(a range taken from baldwin et al .",
    "1989 ) , the scattered nv  1240 flux is 0.4 ",
    "@xmath65 the l@xmath19 flux .",
    "this ratio  with _ no _ contribution from intrinsic nv emission  is right in the middle of the range found by baldwin et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for their sample of quasars with @xmath66  2.5 .",
    "strong enhancement of the nv  1240 line is of particular interest in view of the fact that its flux , relative to both civ  1549 and heii  1640 , increases on average by a factor of 2  3 comparing agn at @xmath67 with those at @xmath68  4 ( hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "if the incidence of balqso s also increases sharply with increasing redshift ( as anecdotal evidence suggests ) , the scattering contribution may explain this systematic change in line ratios .",
    "further support to this idea that the strength of nv  1240 is due to scattering in the bal gas is given by the principal component analysis of quasar spectra by francis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which showed that broad absorption is related to excess n  v emission and broader c  iv emission .",
    "we have shown that if anisotropy in the continuum emission of quasars is correlated with the direction towards broad absorption line gas , optical flux - limited samples of quasars are severely biassed with respect to the discovery of broad absorption line quasars . if , as the simplest models suggest , quasar continua are limb - darkened at the selection wavelengths , balqso s are severely underrepresented in such samples .",
    "the inferred covering fraction of broad absorption gas could well be nearer @xmath18 than the usual estimate of @xmath69 .",
    "such large covering fractions of absorbing gas would have numerous consequences : hard x - ray surveys may discover roughly twice as many quasars as would be predicted on the basis of soft x - ray surveys ; the asca survey may already have done just this . the fact that balqso s are somewhat stronger radio sources than the average radio - quiet quasar would also be explained .",
    "in addition , resonance scattering in the broad absorption gas could contribute to the emission lines .",
    "nv  1240 , because it is just 6000  km  s@xmath27 redward of ly@xmath19 , would be strongly enhanced , providing an alternative explanation [ i.e. other than elevated n abundance : hamann & ferland ( 1992 , 1993 ) ] for the strength of this line in high redshift quasars .",
