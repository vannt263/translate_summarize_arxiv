    "we reconsider the well - studied selfish routing game with affine cost functions and ask whether increasing the cost functions can reduce the cost of a nash flow . in other words , the increased cost functions should induce a user behavior that reduces cost despite the fact that the cost is now determined by increased cost functions .",

    "the price of anarchy , defined as the maximum ratio of nash cost to optimal cost , is 4/3 for this class of games .",
    "we show that increasing costs can reduce the price of anarchy to a value strictly below 4/3 at least for the case of networks of parallel links . for a network of two parallel links , we reduce the price of anarchy to a value between 1.191 and 1.192 and prove that this is optimal . in order to state our results precisely , we need some definitions .",

    "note that for continuous functions the above definition is identical to the wardrop equilibrium .",
    "one has to be careful when designing a coordination mechanism with discontinuous functions , because the existence of equilibria is not always guaranteed .",
    "it is important to emphasize , that all the mechanisms that we suggest in this paper use both lower semicontinuous and regular latencies , and therefore user equilibrium existence is guaranteed due to the theorem of  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since our modified latencies are non - decreasing , all user equilibria are also dafermos - sparrow equilibria .",

    "we obtain the following results for networks of @xmath51 parallel links .    *",
    "if original and modified latency functions are continuous , no improvement is possible , i.e. , @xmath52 ; see section  [ sec : negative result ] . * for the case of affine cost functions , we describe a simple coordination mechanism that achieves an engineered price of anarchy strictly less than 4/3 ; see section  [ sec : mechanism ] .",
    "the functions @xmath53 are of the form @xmath54 for the case of two parallel links , the mechanism gives 5/4 ( see section  [ sec : two links ] ) , for pigou s network it gives 1 , see figure  [ fig : pigou ] . * for the case of two parallel links with affine cost functions , we describe an _ optimal holds for all deterministic coordination mechanisms with respect to the dafermos - sparrow@xcite definition of equilibria . however , the arguments of our proof work for all deterministic coordination mechanisms that use _ non - decreasing modified latencies _ even for the weaker definition of user equilibrium .",

    "there is a vast literature studying the price of anarchy for various models of selfish routing and scheduling problems ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we show that simple coordination mechanisms can reduce the price of anarchy for selfish routing games below the 4/3 worst case for networks of parallel links and affine cost functions .",
    "we believe that our arguments extend to more general cost functions , e.g. , polynomial cost functions .",

    "truthful coordination mechanisms have been studied in @xcite .",

    "roughgarden  @xcite seeks a subnetwork of a given network that has optimal price of anarchy for a given demand .",
    "@xcite studies the question whether tolls can reduce the cost of a nash equilibrium .",
    "they show that for networks with affine latencies , marginal cost pricing does not improve the cost of a flow at nash equilibrium , as well as that the maximum possible benefit that one can get is no more than that of edge removal .",
