    "adaptive networks define a versatile class of models that have been recently applied to a wide variety of systems @xcite .",
    "they combine processes that change the structure of a network , such as growth or rewiring , with dynamics taking place on the network .",
    "this results in a feedback between topology and dynamics that can lead to different forms of self - organization . following the pioneering work of bornholdt and rohlf @xcite adaptive networks",
    "have been applied to a wide range of systems , including neural networks @xcite , mobile sensor networks @xcite , epidemics @xcite , and the evolution of cooperation @xcite , among many others @xcite .    in the study of adaptive networks , a special role",
    "is played by opinion formation models and , in particular , by the adaptive voter model and its variants @xcite .",
    "the adaptive voter model describes the process through which a population of agents forms an opinion .",
    "a group of nodes representing agents are connected by links that describe social interactions .",
    "each node is associated to a variable that can take values representing all possible opinions . at every iteration ,",
    "the network is updated by propagating these values along the links ( social adjustment ) and by rewiring links ( social segregation ) .",
    "one typically considers nodes that rewire their connections to surround themselves by like - minded agents that hold the same opinion .",
    "this common type of social dynamics is called _",
    "its opposite _ heterophily _ , where agents seek connections to different - minded agents @xcite , has received much less attention .",
    "extensions of the adaptive voter model have been recently proposed to describe collective motion in groups of animals @xcite , a basic social phenomenon that occurs in a broad variety of species .",
    "examples include insect swarms , fish schools , bird flocks , herds of quadrupeds @xcite , and even crowds of people @xcite . here",
    ", we will refer to all these , generically , as _",
    "swarming systems_. the process through which such systems self - organize into coordinated collective motion is still poorly understood .",
    "there has been much debate , for example , regarding the nature of the swarming transition that marks the onset of collective motion @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies investigate swarming by either analyzing detailed agent - based models @xcite or representing the swarm as a continuous medium @xcite .",
    "adaptive network models provide an alternative route : the swarm is represented as an adaptive network by an approximation that captures the agents headings and interactions but neglects their trajectories in space . in such models , each agent is represented by a node , its heading direction is treated as an internal state , and mutual awareness between two agents is represented by a link .",
    "but , there is no explicit representation of space , i.e.  no variable keeps track of each agent s position in space .",
    "network swarming models are reminiscent of the standard adaptive voter model if we view the heading directions as the different potential opinions in an opinion formation process",
    ". a notable difference , however , is that in the swarming case having different opinions ( i.e. moving in different directions ) increases , both , the probabilities of creating and of destroying links between agents ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the adaptive swarming models thus constitute a third class of opinion formation systems comprising aspects of both homophily and heterophily .",
    "we refer to such systems as the _ swarming systems class _ of adaptive network models .",
    "this type of approach was originally proposed @xcite to model experiments on the collective motion of groups of locusts marching on a ring - shaped arena @xcite . a slightly extended version of this model was later used to predict the outcome of decision - making experiments with fish @xcite .",
    "we note that the swarming systems class of adaptive network models may also be relevant for other applications that consider motion in abstract ( rather than physical ) space .",
    "for instance , if translated into a social context where different heading directions correspond to different opinions , it describes individuals that create or destroy social connections mainly with those who have a different opinion .",
    "while this is not the most common social dynamics , it may describe situations where original opinions are strongly valued and attract new social interactions but also create tensions within established interactions , leading to dissolution .    the previously proposed adaptive network models for swarming systems considered only cases where each agent was restricted to choose between two heading directions , corresponding to clock - wise or counter - clockwise motion on the circular arena @xcite or to swimming towards one of two targets @xcite in the collective decision - making experiment .",
    "these investigations thus focused on situations where the internal opinion state was a binary variable , akin to the adaptive voter model .",
    "while several multi - state extensions to the voter model have been explored @xcite , the present paper is the first to analyze a similar extension for the swarming system class of adaptive network models .",
    "this extension is intuitive , as real swarms typically move in two or three - dimensional space , where the heading direction can be discretized into more than two node states .    in this paper",
    "we show that the swarming system class of adaptive network models displays a symmetry - breaking ordering transition that can be likened to collective motion . this transition can be either continuous or discontinuous , depending on the number of accessible states ( e.g.  the dimensionality of the embedding space ) .",

    "before carrying out an adaptive network analysis , it is instructive to gain some intuition by considering a mean field approximation .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to neglecting the link dynamics and assuming that the density of links connecting nodes in given states is proportional to the product of the densities of these states . while crude",
    ", it leads to a picture that is qualitatively similar to the adaptive network results described in section [ sec : adaptivenetworksol ] .    for simplicity",
    ", we denote by @xmath17 the density of any given state and by @xmath18 the density of all other @xmath11 states .",
    "the mean field approximation then leads to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mean degree , i.e.  the mean number of links per network node .    in the equation",
    "the first two terms describe the gain and loss of nodes in state @xmath17 due to spontaneous switching , respectively , and the last term captures the gains and losses resulting from the triplet process .",
    "the conservation of the total node density implies that @xmath21 .",
    "basic intuition and preliminary numerical simulations suggest that the system will either converge towards a disordered ( mixed ) solution where all node states occur with the same probability or to an ordered solution where a preferred direction emerges and its corresponding state is overexpressed in the population , while the other states remain at an equal , lower density .",
    "we can thus make analytical progress by assuming @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to the simplified system @xmath23 where we defined @xmath24 and @xmath25 , to simplify the expression .",

    ", direct visual inspection reveals the bifurcation points at which the stability of these steady state branches changes : bifurcations occur both at the tips of the parabolas and at the intersection point of the different solutions .",
    "the tip of the parabola corresponds to the point @xmath33 , where the stable and unstable solution branches meet through a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the intersection of the two solutions occurs at @xmath34 where a degenerate transcritical bifurcation takes place .    in the context of the full system ,",

    "( [ eq : meanfield ] ) verifies the results above and shows an additional set of stable solution branches in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ( labeled by ii ) . in these branches",
    "two majority opinions are represented in an equal number of nodes and while a single minority opinion is held by a smaller number of nodes . however , in the next section we show that the stability of these branches is lost when a more accurate approximation is used .",
    "this suggests that the stability of the 2-majority/1-minority branches is a spurious result of the mean field approximation , which appears due to an excessive reduction of the dimensionality of the state space . in the full system these branches must thus be unstable to certain perturbations that involve a dynamical redistribution of links , which is not captured by the mean field .",
    "we now derive a system of equations that takes the dynamics of link densities into account , using a moment expansion @xcite .",

    "the inset displays @xmath71 and @xmath84 as a function of @xmath5 ; the bistable region is broader for larger @xmath5 values . ]    in this section , we will relate the ordering transition described above to the collective motion transition observed in swarms @xcite . for this purpose , each node is interpreted as a self - propelled agent , its state as its heading direction , and linked nodes as interacting agents .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that it does not require specifying the details of the interactions .",
    "while collective motion can result from a broad variety of interactions ( such as aligning @xcite , attraction - repulsion @xcite , or escape - pursuit @xcite ) , the adaptive - network perspective can treat all of these equally by focusing on the exchanges of information that lead to consensus on the collective heading direction , without considering the details of the interactions .",
    "in particular , if we assume that interactions can only occur within a given distance , the limit case studied in this paper ( where the linking and unlinking rates between agents in the same state is set to zero ) can be mapped to a situation where agents that advance in a common direction do not change their relative positions and therefore do not create or destroy interactions between them .",
    "we also focus on the simplest limit case where the linking and unlinking rates ( corresponding here to the encounter and disbanding rates at which agents start or stop interacting with each other ) are constant and equal for all agents in different states ( i.e. with different headings ) .    in order to compare our adaptive network system to collective motion , we start by associating each node state @xmath85 $ ] with an agent s heading @xmath86 in a space where agents can only move in discretized directions that are perpendicular to each other .",
    "each @xmath86 is thus a unit vector pointing in a direction that is either opposite or orthogonal to all others .",
    "the number of potential headings @xmath5 therefore depends on the dimensionality of the space , with @xmath15 in one dimension , @xmath87 in two dimensions , @xmath88 in three dimensions and , in general , @xmath89 in @xmath90 dimensions .",
    "the usual polarization order parameter used to describe the degree of alignment and of collective motion in swarming systems is given by @xmath91 where @xmath4 is the total number of agents and @xmath92 is a unit vector indicating the heading direction of agent @xmath93 @xcite . with this definition , @xmath94 if all agents are perfectly aligned and swarming in the same direction , whereas @xmath83 if they are randomly oriented . in the discretized space with",
    "only orthogonal heading directions that we consider here , @xmath95 can be expressed as @xmath96 - \\left [ 2 h - 1 \\right ] \\right)^2 } .\\ ] ] this relationship allows us to plot the polarization order parameter @xmath95 as a function of @xmath0 , which serves as a proxy for the amount of noise in the agent motion ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .    in the context of swarms , the symmetry - breaking bifurcations computed above correspond to ordering phase transitions to collective motion . for agents moving in one - dimensional space ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the transition is continuous ( second order ) , whereas for agents moving in more dimensions ( @xmath97 ) , the transition is discontinuous ( first order ) .",
    "a region of bistability appears for @xmath59 and becomes broader for higher values of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , inset ) .",
    "although the adaptive network approach includes several approximations , the results above provide insights into the more complex problem of understanding general features of the transition to collective motion in swarms .",
    "the question of whether the actual swarming transition to collective motion is continuous or discontinuous , for example , has been the subject of intense debate @xcite . while in the initial numerical explorations the transition appeared to be continuous ( second order )",
    ", it was later shown through theoretical arguments and large - scale numerical simulations that it is , in fact , discontinuous ( first order ) and has a bistable transition region where ordered and disordered swarming states coexist @xcite .",

    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "these match the interaction frequencies that are expected to occur in swarms .",
    "for example , the total number of links decreases monotonically with noise level , which corresponds to the observation that higher noise values will produce less clustering and therefore fewer interactions between agents in swarming systems @xcite .",
    "we also see that the density of heterophilic links @xmath101 $ ] ( and @xmath102 $ ] in the @xmath104 case ) increases with noise .",
    "this can be explained by an increasing rate of encounters at higher noise levels .",
    "furthermore , we find that for all cases with @xmath105 ( such as the @xmath16 case displayed in the figure ) the density of heterophilic links in the ordered branch , @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 $ ] , continues to increase as a function of noise within the bistable region , where it becomes higher than that of the disordered branch . despite this high number of heterophilic links",
    ", the ordered branch persists because the density of homophilic links @xmath98 $ ] is also high .",
    "this can be related to what is observed in the bistable region in swarms , where it is known that a higher density of interactions between agents in the majority heading state , which corresponds to the formation of high - density bands ( oriented perpendicular to the heading direction ) in two or more dimensions , stabilizes the ordered state @xcite , leading to a bistable region and thus to a discontinuous transition .",
    "this analogy could provide an alternative way to understand the details of the swarming transition as a function of the dimension of the embedding space .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the swarming systems class of adaptive network models , where links can only be created or deleted between nodes in different states .",
    "we showed analytically that this class displays a symmetry - breaking transition with properties that depend on the number of states @xmath5 accessible to each node . if @xmath15 , the transition occurs through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation ; if @xmath59 , through a subcritical one .",
    "consequently , only this latter case displays a bistable region near the bifurcation point .",
    "note , however , that previous work @xcite had shown that bistable solutions can also be obtained in the @xmath15 case if we allow link creation and deletion processes to occur between nodes in the same state , a situation that was not studied here . the results above , taken together , provide insights on a potential direct connection between link dynamics , their dependence on internal states , and the resulting properties of this type of symmetry - breaking transitions .",
    "we also discussed in this paper their implications for the analysis of the collective motion transition in swarms .",
    "the parallels between the adaptive - network approach presented here and agent - based dynamics are not restricted to swarming systems .",
    "they can be extended to any group of agents moving in an abstract phase space with similar dynamical rules .",
    "these rules must consider agents with an internal state ( as the heading direction in the swarming case ) that determines their trajectory in this phase space , in which their relative positions determine whether they interact .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the proposed model could be extended to study social processes involving heterophily , such as the diffusion of innovations and technologies @xcite or job seeking through weak interpersonal ties @xcite .",

    "additional material will be made available on www.biond.org .",
    "it is also natural to consider an additional process , whereby a pair of linked nodes @xmath106 , each in a different state , can influence each other to produce either @xmath107 or @xmath108 . for the stationary solutions considered here ,",
    "however , these terms will cancel out and the total density of nodes in a given state will remain unchanged @xcite . for simplicity , we will therefore not include here any terms representing these processes .",
