    "the observation of resonant structures in the excitation functions for various combinations of light @xmath0-cluster ( n = z ) nuclei in the energy regime from the coulomb barrier up to regions with excitation energies of e@xmath2 = 20 - 50  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate  @xcite .",
    "these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "the question of how quasimolecular resonances may reflect contiuous transitions from scattering states in the ion - ion potential to true cluster states in the compound systems is still unresolved @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with alpha - clustering phenomena @xcite , predicted from the nilsson - strutinsky approach , the cranked @xmath0-cluster model  @xcite , or other mean - field calculations  @xcite . in light",
    "@xmath0-like nuclei clustering is observed as a general phenomenon at high excitation energy close to the @xmath0-decay thresholds @xcite .",
    "this exotic behavior has been perfectly well illustrated by the famous `` ikeda''-diagram for n = z nuclei in 1968 @xcite that has been recently extended by von oertzen @xcite for neutron - rich nuclei , as shown in the left panel of fig.1 .",
    "clustering is a general phenomenon not only observed in light neutron - rich nuclei @xcite but also in halo nuclei such as @xmath3li @xcite or in very heavy systems where giant molecules can exist @xcite .",
    "the relationship between superdeformation ( sd ) , nuclear molecules and alpha clustering @xcite is of particular interest , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 have the typical ellipsoidal elongation ( with quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath4 @xmath5 0.6 ) for light nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes ( with @xmath4 @xmath5 1.0 ) - hyperdeformation ( hd ) - for actinide nuclei has also been widely discussed @xcite in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "typical examples of a possible link between quasimolecular bands and extremely deformed ( sd / hd ) shapes have been widely discussed in the literature for light n = z nuclei , for a@xmath6 = 20 - 60 , such as @xmath7si @xcite , @xmath8s @xcite , @xmath9ar @xcite , @xmath10ca @xcite , @xmath11ti @xcite , @xmath12cr @xcite and @xmath13ni @xcite .",
    "in fact , highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been recently discovered in several such n = z nuclei , such as @xmath9ar and @xmath10ca by using @xmath14-ray spectroscopy techniques @xcite . in particular , the extremely deformed rotational bands in @xmath9ar @xcite ( shown as crosses in fig .",
    "2 ) are observed as quasimolecular bands in both @xmath1c+@xmath15 mg @xcite ( shown as open triangles in fig .  2 ) and @xmath16o+@xmath17ne reactions @xcite ( shown as full rectangles ) , and their related ternary clusterizations",
    "are also predicted theoretically but were not found experimentally in @xmath9ar so far @xcite .",
    "similar negative results were previoulsy reported for @xmath12cr @xcite . on the other hand , ternary fission related to hyperdeformed shapes of @xmath13ni",
    "was identified from out - of - plane angular correlations measured in the @xmath8s+@xmath15 mg reaction with the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) at the vivitron facility of the iphc strasbourg @xcite .",
    "this finding @xcite is not limited to light n = z compound nuclei ( note that same results were also obtained for @xmath18zn @xcite ) but true ternary fission @xcite can also occur for very heavy @xcite and superheavy @xcite nuclei .",
    "there is a renewed interest in the spectroscopy of the @xmath16o nucleus at high excitation energy @xcite .",
    "exclusive data were collected with the inverse kinematics reaction @xmath15mg@xmath19c studied at e@xmath20(@xmath15 mg ) = 130 mev with the brs in coincidence with the euroball iv installed at the vivitron tandem facility at strasbourg @xcite . from the @xmath0-transfer reactions ( both direct transfer and deep - inelastic orbiting collisions @xcite ) , new information has been deduced on branching ratios of the decay of the 3@xmath21 state of @xmath16o at 11.085  mev @xmath22 3 kev .",
    "the high - energy level scheme of @xmath16o indicates in fig .",
    "3 that this state does not @xmath0-decay because of non - natural parity ( in contrast to the two neighbouring 4@xmath21 states at 10.36  mev and 11.10  mev , respectively ) it decays also to the 2@xmath21 state at 6.92  mev ( 54.6 @xmath22 2 @xmath23 ) . by considering all the four possibilities of transitions types of the 3@xmath21 state ( i.e. e@xmath24 and m@xmath25 for the 3@xmath21 @xmath26 3@xmath27 transition and , m@xmath24 and e@xmath25 for the 3@xmath21 @xmath26 2@xmath21 transition )",
    ", our calculations yield the conclusion that a value for the decay width @xmath28 is fifty times lower than known previously , it means @xmath29 @xmath30 0.23 ev .",
    "this result is important as it is the last known @xmath14-decay level for the well studied @xmath16o nucleus @xcite .",
    "the highly collective state 3@xmath27 has symmetry , which may not be realized by the @xmath0-cluster structure .",
    "hence , it has small overlap with the @xmath0-cluster dominated states and small alpha decay rate . in section 3",
    "we will discuss clustering effects in the other light neutron - rich oxygen isotopes : @xmath31o .    in the framework of the study of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) the @xmath0-particle state @xcite in light",
    "n = z nuclei , an experimental signature of bec in @xmath16o , is at present of highest priority .",
    "an equivalent @xmath0+hoyle `` state @xcite in @xmath1c is predicted to be the 0@xmath32 state of @xmath16o at about 15.1 mev , which energy is just lying ( i.e. @xmath5 700 kev ) above the 4@xmath0-particle breakup threshold @xcite .",
    "however , any state in @xmath16o equivalent to the so - called  hoyle '' state @xcite in @xmath1c is most certainly going to decay by particle emission with very small , probably un - measurable , @xmath14-decay branches .",
    "very efficient particle - detection techniques will have to be used in the near future as such bec states will be expected to decay by alpha emission to the  hoyle \" state , and could be associated with resonances in @xmath0-particle inelastic scattering on @xmath1c leading to that state , or be observed in @xmath0-particle transfer to the @xmath33be-@xmath33be final state .",
    "another possibility might be to perform coulomb excitation measurements with intense @xmath16o beams at intermediate energies .",
    "as discussed previously clustering is a general phenomenon also observed for nuclei with extra neutrons in an extended `` ikeda''-diagram @xcite as proposed by von oertzen @xcite ( see the left panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "with additional neutrons specific molecular structures appear , with binding effects based on covalent molecular neutron orbitals . in these diagram @xmath0-clusters and @xmath16o - clusters ( as shown by the middle panel of the diagram of fig .  1 )",
    "are the main ingredients . actually , the @xmath34c nucleus has equivalent properties as a cluster , as the @xmath16o nucleus : i ) closed neutron p - shells , ii ) first excited states well above e@xmath35 = 6 mev , and iii ) high binding energies for @xmath0-particles .",
    "a general picture of clustering and molecular configurations in light nuclei can be drawn from a detailed investigation of the light oxygen isotopes with a @xmath36 17 . here",
    "we will only present recent results of the even - even oxygen isotopes : @xmath37o @xcite ( note that @xmath0-cluster properties of @xmath37o are also discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath17o @xcite .",
    "but very strinking cluster states have also been found in odd - even oxygen isotopes such as : @xmath38o @xcite and @xmath39o @xcite .",
    "4 gives an overview of all bands in @xmath37o as a plot of excitation energies in dependence of j(j+1 ) together with their respective moment of inertia . in the construction of the bands both",
    "the excitation energy systematics of the j(j+1 ) dependence and the measured cross sections @xcite dependence on ( 2j+1 ) were used .",
    "the experimental molecular bands are supported by either generator - coordinate - method @xcite or antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculations @xcite .",
    "slope parameters obtained in a linear fit to the excitation energies data @xcite indicate the moment of inertia of the rotational bands given in fig .",
    "the intrinsic structure of the cluster bands is reflection asymmetric , the parity projection gives an energy splitting between the partner bands .    for @xmath17o @xcite",
    ", we can compare the bands of fig .  5 with those of @xmath37o ( displayed in fig .  4 )",
    "the first doublet ( k=0@xmath40 ) has a moment of inertia which is slightly larger ( smaller slope parameter ) , consistent with the interpretation as ( @xmath34c-@xmath41he or @xmath16c-@xmath42he ) molecular structures ( they start well below the thresholds of 16.8 mev and 12.32 mev , respectively ) . the second band , for which the negative parity partner is yet to be determined , has a slope parameter slightly smaller as compared to @xmath37o .",
    "this is consistent with the study of bands in @xmath17o by furutachi et al .",
    "@xcite that clearly establishes parity inversion doublets predicted by amd calculations for the @xmath34c-@xmath43he cluster and @xmath34c-2n-@xmath0 molecular structures .    the corresponding momenta of inertia values given in fig .  4 and fig .",
    "5 are highly suggesting large deformations of the clusters structures .",
    "we may also conclude that the strongly bound @xmath34c nucleus has equivalent properties as an @xmath16o cluster , as mentioned previously .",
    "therefore , the ikeda - diagram @xcite and the `` extended ikeda - diagram '' consisting of @xmath16o clusters cores with covalently bound neutrons @xcite must be revised to include also the @xmath34c clusters cores as illustrated by fig .  1 .",
    "the connection of @xmath0-clustering , quasimolecular resonances , orbiting phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) has been discussed in this work by using @xmath14-ray spectroscopy of coincident binary fragments from either inelastic excitations and direct transfers ( with small energy damping and spin transfer ) or from orbiting ( fully damped ) processes @xcite . from a careful analysis of the @xmath16o+@xmath17ne @xmath0-transfer exit - channel",
    "( strongly populated by orbiting ) new information has been deduced on branching ratios of the decay of the 3@xmath21 state of @xmath16o at 11.089  mev .",
    "this result is encouraging for a complete @xmath14-ray spectroscopy of the @xmath16o nucleus at high excitation energy .",
    "of particular interest is the quest for the corresponding 4@xmath0 states near the @xmath33be+@xmath33be and @xmath1c+@xmath0 decay thresholds .",
    "the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued by @xmath14-ray spectroscopy measurements , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged - particle techniques in the near future ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we have presented new results of neutron - rich oxygen isotopes displaying very well defined molecular bands in agreement with amd predictions .",
    "consequently , the extended ikeda diagram has been revised for light neutron - rich nuclei to include the @xmath34c cluster , similarly to the @xmath16o cluster .",
    "we thank the vivitron staff and the euroball group of strasbourg for their excellent support .",
    "one of us ( c.b . ) would like to acknowledge c. bhattacharya , j. cseh , y. kanada - enyo , m. norrby , and y. taniguchi for providing him with new results prior to their publication , as well as christian caron ( springer ) for initiating the new series of lecture notes in physics dedicated to `` clusters in nuclei '' .",
