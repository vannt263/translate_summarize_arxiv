    "the standard formulation of quantum mechanics requires physical observables to be mathematically given in terms of hermitian operators . in the last decade theories with a non - hermitian hamiltonian",
    "have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "the initial momentum was given by work concerning pt - symmetric schrdinger operators @xcite .",
    "it was hoped that the pt - symmetric hamiltonians , which are complex but nevertheless possess a real spectrum , would provide an extension of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "it was later argued however that these non - hermitian operators could be mapped to hermitian ones by a similarity transform @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the non - hermitian framework remains useful .",
    "indeed , from a fundamental perspective it opens up the possibility of doing quantum mechanics with non - standard inner products .",
    "this has practical consequences because many physical systems are naturally formulated in non - hermitian terms @xcite .",
    "scattering systems involving bound states in real potentials are such a case .",
    "while scattering problems in complex potentials have been prominent in the studies of non - hermitian hamiltonians , bound state scattering in short - range real potentials have been scarcely investigated @xcite . in this case ,",
    "non - hermiticity arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the scattering functions , ultimately linked to the fact that the scattering solutions are not the full eigenstates of the exact hamiltonian .  from the physical point of view",
    "this exact hamiltonian exists , but its eigenstates are unknown in practice , while the bound scattering solutions are eigenstates of an effective hamiltonian that is not hermitian relative to the standard inner product .",
    "hence in principle one should employ a biorthogonal basis , or equivalently obtain the metric operator in order to define the inner product relative to which the effective hamiltonian becomes self - adjoint .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the interaction between a bound state scattering system and a measurement device in a scheme popularly known as `` weak measurements '' ( wm ) .",
    "wm , introduced more than 2 decades ago @xcite , have been receiving an increased attention these last 5 years , in particular as theoretical but also experimental tool aimed at investigating fundamental problems in quantum mechanics ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "wm actually involve two steps : the first step is a weak interaction between the system and a `` weak meter '' , the overall evolution being unitary .",
    "the second step is a standard projective measurement in which the system ( at that point entangled with the weak meter ) interacts with a different measurement device .",
    "the state of the system is projected to a final post - measurement state , while the weak meter has picked up a phase depending on a quantity known as the `` weak value '' of the weakly measured observable . in the conjugate variable of the pointer",
    ", the phase - shift appears as as a shift in the probability distribution .",
    "this shift can be experimentally measured by obtaining the probability distribution of the weak pointer .",
    "the main issue when considering a weak measurement of a non - hermitian system lies in the treatment of the coupling between the system and the weak meter . indeed in a standard projective measurement the observed quantity is an eigenvalue , which is a real quantity not depending on the definition of the inner product .  in a weak measurement ,",
    "the observed quantity is a shift in the pointer proportional to the weak value , which , as will be seen below , is a renormalized transition element .",
    "it is therefore crucial in order to determine the weak value , to properly define the inner product and the physical hilbert space .",
    "we will first briefly introduce weak measurements and give the usual formula for computing weak values ( sec 2 ) .",
    "we will then derive the weak value for non - hermitian systems . in order to provide an unambiguous physical basis ,",
    "this derivation will be done in the context of bound state scattering theory .",
    "we will thus explain why systems described with this formalism are non - hermitian in the ` physical ' hilbert space , leading to the definition of a new inner product and its associated hilbert space , in which the weak values must be defined ( sec  3 )",
    ". we will then give in sec 4 examples of weak value computations for a model bound scattering system .",
    "we will see that non - hermitian issues must be incorporated explicitly in order to account for the correct shift in the weak measurement apparatus .",
    "our concluding remarks will be given in sec  5 .",
    "a standard quantum measurement , often represented by the projection of a premeasurement state of the system to an eigenstate of the measured system observable , actually involves a two - step procedure .  first a unitary interaction between the measured system and the measurement apparatus results in a system - apparatus state entangled in the pointer basis .  then in a second step the entangled state",
    "is projected to a final post - measurement state correlating a unique pointer state with an eigenstate of the measured observable .    a weak measurement of an observable @xmath0 proceeds differently .",
    "first a weak unitary interaction takes place between the system and the `` weak '' meter .",
    "the weakness of the interaction results in an entanglement @xcite in which the different pointer states are nearly identical .",
    "then a standard quantum measurement of a different observable takes place , resulting in the usual projection to an eigenstate of this second observable .",
    "since the system and the weak apparatus were still entangled , the projection to a final state of the system also determines the quantum state of the weak meter .    rather than solving for the weak interaction in terms of the entangled states in the pointer basis , the standard approach @xcite to weak measurements starts from a first order expansion of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the initial states of the system and weak meter respectively just before they interact , and let us assume an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath3 where the system observable @xmath0 is coupled to the weak pointer s position variable along the @xmath4 axis ( ie @xmath5 for the pointer ) .",
    "@xmath6 is a smooth function of @xmath7 vanishing outside the interval @xmath8 during which the interaction takes place and obeying @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mean effective coupling strength .",
    "neglecting the self - evolution of the system and meter during the time interval @xmath11 , the unitary evolution generated by @xmath12 brings the initial state @xmath13 to@xmath14 a projective measurement of another observable @xmath15 of the system is made immediately after .",
    "the system state is projected to one of the eigenstates of @xmath16 among the possible outcomes we select only the cases in which the final state is @xmath17the standard approach consists in expanding the exponential to first order in @xmath10 and then compute the projection @xmath18 the term@xmath19 is known as the weak value of @xmath20 eq .",
    "( [ w5 ] ) indicates that the weak meter has picked up a phase ( in configuration space ) , or alternatively a shift ( in momentum space ) proportional to the weak value of @xmath0 , given the initial ( known as `` preselected '' ) state , and the final ( `` postselected '' ) state obtained after having made a standard measurement of another observable @xmath15 .",
    "note that the weak value can be a complex number , implying different shifts can be observed in the conjugate variables of the meter @xcite .    the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ w5 ] ) involves several approximations ( see eg @xcite ) that will not be discussed here .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition is that @xmath21 is small , generally implying that the coupling @xmath10 must be vanishingly small ( because @xmath22 is generally large ) .",
    "the important point , from a physical perspective , is that measuring the weak meter wavefunction allows to obtain information , encoded in @xmath22 , on the system observable @xmath0 without making a full quantum measurement of that observable .",
    "instead another , possibly incompatible property @xmath15 is measured .",
    "the applications and interpretations of wm are out of the scope of this work .",
    "our focus here lies in the weak measurement of a system described in a non - hermitian framework .  indeed , accounting for wm",
    "involves treating  though only to first order  the interaction between the non - hermitian system and a measurement device . contrary to a standard measurement , in which case the outcome would be an eigenvalue , the measurement device is shifted by the weak value . however the definition ( [ w7 ] ) of the weak value is valid in standard ( hermitian ) quantum mechanics . for a system described in a quasi - hermitian framework @xmath22 must be computed in the correct hilbert space , endowed with a non - standard inner product , as will be seen below .",
    "the weak value as given by eq ( [ w7 ] ) needs to be modified for systems described in a non - hermitian setting .",
    "the rationale , well - known to practitioners of pt - symmetric / quasi - hermitian quantum mechanics , is that the inner product needs to be replaced .",
    "given the controversies surrounding the physical interpretation of non - hermitian systems @xcite , our approach will consist in working with a system  or rather family of systems , those involving bound state scattering  that has an important advantage : the non - hermitian aspects appear because one is led to work with wavefunctions defined on a modified configuration space .",
    "this means that while the scattering hamiltonian is non - hermitian , there is in principle an underlying exact hamiltonian ( though untractable in practice ) .  as a result",
    "there is no ambiguity when delaing with the conceptual aspects surrounding non - hermiticity",
    ".    we will therefore first give a brief presentation of bound state scattering , exposed previously in ref @xcite , and discuss its non - hermitian aspects in order to derive the formula for the weak value in non - hermitian systems , given by eq ( [ wv ] ) below .",
    "for definiteness , let us consider 2  particles , a light particle and a massive compound target , attracted by a long - range radial field .",
    "the scattering between the particles is described by a short - range potential . letting @xmath23 denote the exact hamiltonian in the center of mass ,",
    "we assume @xmath23 can be split as@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hamiltonian of the light particle in the long - rang field while @xmath26 contains all the _ short range _ interactions between the light particle and the target .",
    "we further assume that@xmath27 ie @xmath26 vanishes outside some small radius @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the step function ) .",
    "the total energy @xmath30 can be partitioned as@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the internal energy of the target ( depending on the target quantum state ) and @xmath33 is the energy of the light particle .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath25 are given by @xmath34 @xmath35 is the eigenfunction of the radial part of @xmath25 whereas the ` target ' state @xmath36 includes all the other degrees of freedom , including the non - radial ones of the colliding particle ( a handy notation given that the angular momenta of the particles are usually coupled ) .",
    "the target states are orthogonal , @xmath37 . for bound states",
    "@xmath38 vanishes at @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( whenever @xmath30 is an eigenvalue of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the label @xmath41 defines the scattering channel . in each channel",
    "the standing - wave solutions are given by the lippmann - schwinger equations of scattering theory as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the principal - value green s function and @xmath44 the reaction ( scattering ) operator for standing waves linked to the familiar @xmath45 matrix by a cayley transform @xcite .",
    "the difference here with standard scattering theory is that the bound channels are included explicitly .",
    "is modified relative to the usual resolvent by including a term canceling the poles at the eigenvalues of @xmath23 @xcite . ]",
    "both @xmath46 and @xmath47 diverge as @xmath48 for an arbitrary value of @xmath30 .",
    "a bound state appears when the superposition@xmath49 converges as @xmath48 .",
    "this happens for discrete values of the energy obtained , along with the expansion coefficients @xmath50 by imposing the boundary conditions .    while @xmath23 is undoubtedly hermitian relative to the standard inner product , its eigenfunctions",
    "can not be computed from eqs ( [ z50])-([z52 ] ) because the formal expansion of @xmath51 over the eigenstates of @xmath52 is intractable .",
    "instead the scattering formulation consists in obtaining a closed form expression of @xmath51 but valid only outside the reaction zone , ie for @xmath53 . indeed from the scattering viewpoint , whatever happens within the reaction zone is encoded in the phase - shifts .",
    "the wavefunction ( [ z52 ] ) outside the reaction zone takes the form@xmath54   \\qquad r > r_{0 } \\label{e20}%\\ ] ] where @xmath55 are the on - shell elements of the scattering matrix , which are assumed to be known .",
    "@xmath56 is , like @xmath57 introduced in eq ( [ 4 ] ) , a solution of the radial part of @xmath25 but it is irregular at the origin .",
    "the scattering state @xmath58 of ( [ e20 ] ) is the part for @xmath53 of the exact solution @xmath59 , and _ not _ an approximation to it . but within the scattering formulation the inner part of @xmath60 for @xmath61 does not exist : all meaningful quantities are defined radially on @xmath62 . as a consequence,@xmath63 ie the scattering states are normalized to 1 , but are not orthogonal ;",
    "this is due to the fact that the boundary conditions at @xmath64 are not identical for all the @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "hence the scattering states can not be eigenstates of the hermitian operator @xmath65 since @xmath66 a non - hermitian hamiltonian needs to be introduced instead .",
    "let @xmath67 be the hilbert space of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "physical states are represented by vectors in @xmath67 . from a practical viewpoint",
    ", we may consider that the phase - shifts ( or the @xmath44 matrix elements ) are known and the problem concerns the expansion of physical states in terms of the scattering solutions @xmath68    to this end let us introduce a non - hermitian operator @xmath69  and state vectors @xmath70 such that@xmath71 where @xmath72 forms a biorthogonal basis .",
    "it follows that we can write the following expansions:@xmath73 @xmath69 and @xmath74 are further linked by@xmath75 where @xmath76 is a hermitian operator given by@xmath77 eq ( [ e40 ] ) is the defining relation of quasi - hermiticity @xcite @xmath76 being invertible and positive - definite @xcite .",
    "this allows to define a hilbert space @xmath78 endowed with a new inner product depending on the metric @xmath76:@xmath79 eq ( [ e40 ] ) indicates that @xmath69 is hermitian relative to this new inner product .",
    "completeness of the biorthogonal basis allows to expand an arbitrary state of @xmath67 in terms of the @xmath80 , ie the eigenstates of @xmath69 span the entire hilbert space of admissible physical states even if they do not form an orthogonal basis in @xmath67    calculations involving the scattering states have to be performed in @xmath78 rather than in @xmath67 .",
    "indeed although a physical state @xmath81 is known in @xmath82 , its expansion over the scattering eigenstates @xmath83 is defined in @xmath78 with the expansion coefficients given through@xmath84 where we have put @xmath85 note that in the underlying _ exact _ problem , there is a physical state corresponding to @xmath86 and given by the same expansion coefficients but over the eigenstates of the exact hamiltonian , @xmath87 with @xmath88 we can therefore understand non - hermiticity as a consequence of working with exact wavefunctions but defined only over part of configuration space relative to the underlying exact problem .    as was the case with @xmath89 [ eq ( [ 24 ] ) ] that needed to be replaced with @xmath69 , an operator @xmath0 hermitian in @xmath67 is represented in @xmath78 by an operator @xmath90 whose expansion over the biorthogonal basis reads @xmath91 the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath90 is given by @xcite @xmath92 .",
    "the time evolution operator is a prominent example : @xmath93 is _ not _ unitary in @xmath94the correct unitary operator in @xmath67 is obtained from @xmath95 where @xmath96 defined by@xmath97 is ( pseudo ) unitary in @xmath78 .",
    "we are now in a position to formulate the weak value expression for a non - hermitian system .",
    "first note that , as described in sec .",
    "2 , we do not need to solve explicitly the full problem involving the coupling of a non - hermitian system to a hermitian one ( as eg in ref .",
    "indeed the non - hermitian system is practically not affected by the weak interaction , while the hermitian one ( the meter ) simply picks up a phase .",
    "this phase  the weak value  is therefore the only quantity we need to determine .",
    "let @xmath98 be the initial ( `` preselected '' ) state prior to the weak measurement of a system observable @xmath99 and @xmath100 the `` postselected '' state obtained after the subsequent projective measurement . according to the discussion above , @xmath101 and @xmath102 represent the physical states in @xmath78 and the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 are given by formulae analog to eq ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the observable @xmath99 is represented in @xmath78 by the non - hermitian operator @xmath90 whose expansion over the biorthogonal basis was given by eq ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "the formula ( [ w7 ] ) expressing the weak value of the observable @xmath0 becomes@xmath105 or in terms of the standard inner product notation@xmath106 hence when a system that is non - herrmitian ( relative to the standard inner product ) interacts with a weak measurement apparatus measuring the observable @xmath0 , the meter is shifted by a quantity given by eq ( [ wv ] ) , not by eq  ( [ w7 ] ) ; eqs ( [ wv ] ) and  ( [ w7 ] ) obviously coincide when the metric is flat ( @xmath76 is the identity operator ) .",
    "note that the shift in the weak measurement apparatus can in principle be experimentally observed .",
    "we will give examples involving the computation of eq ( [ wv ] ) in a situation well - known in atomic physics involving atoms with a single excited electron .",
    "in this case the long - range field is the familiar coulomb potential and the reaction zone is about the size of the atomic core .",
    "the excited electron periodically scatters off the core , the core - electron interaction being embodied in the short - range potential .",
    "we set up a model with 5 scattering channels : the target has a ground state with @xmath107 and 4 excited states with energies @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath109 scattering matrix @xmath110 is chosen to have a very strong energy dependence , or equivalently the phase - shifts , are taken as independent of the energy , then the problem remains formally non - hermitian , but the non - hermitian character becomes negligible in practical computations @xcite as @xmath76 is then nearly identical to the identity ( flat metric ) . ] in order to have stronger non - diagonal elements of the metric @xmath76 ( a non - hermiticity index @xmath111 can be defined by averaging over the @xmath112 largest non - diagonal elements of @xmath76 where @xmath112 is the dimension of the metric ; in this model we have @xmath113 , a non - negligible though relatively samll value ) .",
    "the bound state energies @xmath30 are obtained numerically by enforcing the boundary conditions in eq ( [ e20 ] ) and then the coefficients @xmath114 are retrieved by solving the relevant linear system . while the number of bound states is infinite , good numerical convergence is obtained by taking about 200 states above and 200 states below the energy interval of interest .",
    "the metric employed in the numerical computations is thus a @xmath115 matrix .    for the purpose of illustration we will determine the weak value of the radial position of the excited electron and the weak value of the energy , assuming in both cases postselection can be made to a final state identical to the initial one .",
    "we choose an initial state @xmath116 , that we take to be a gaussian localized radially very far from the target , at the outer turning point of the radial potential for an excited electron ( with a mean energy @xmath117 ) , with the target being in its ground state .",
    "initially @xmath116 is defined on an orthogonal basis of @xmath67 but we assume ( and verify numerically ) that this state can approximately be expanded on our chunk of computed eigenstates of @xmath69 as@xmath118 where the @xmath119 are determined as in eq ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "we now proceed to compute weak values .",
    "we consider a scheme in which a weak measurement of the energy is made at @xmath120 , immediately followed by a projection to a final state .",
    "we assume for definiteness it is possible to postselect on a state @xmath121 identical to the initial state @xmath122 , for example by considering a weak measurement apparatus consisting in an array of devices placed spherically at a radial distance @xmath123 from the atomic core ; the weak measurement time @xmath124 must then correspond to the recurrence time ( when the wavepacket relocalizes periodically at the turning point @xcite ) in the initial scattering channel , here channel 1 .",
    "if non - hermitian issues are ignored , then the operator @xmath89 of eq ( [ 24 ] ) would be employed for the hamiltonian , the evolution operator , accounting for the evolution of the system form @xmath125 to @xmath124 would be taken as @xmath126 and the weak value obtained from the usual definition ( [ w7 ] ) would thus be given by@xmath127 this quantity is plotted in fig .  1 ( dotted lines ) for different possible choices of the measurement time @xmath124",
