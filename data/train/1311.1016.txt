    "explosives usually contain a mixture of fuels and oxidizers in appropriate proportions to enhance combustion and to release large amount of energy at the expense of chemical reactions occurring in the system .",
    "oxidizers such as metal or ammonium - based nitrates , chlorates , perchlorates , permanganates , chromates , peroxides are frequently used in the explosives and pyrotechnic systems.@xcite explosive materials undergo decomposition and lead to high energy release via oxidation process .",
    "most of the secondary explosives have negative oxygen balance ( oxygen deficiency ) and their heat release is restricted due to incomplete oxidation reactions.@xcite hence , oxidizers are mixed with energetic materials to make the oxidation reactions more complete and reduce the demand of oxygen from the air.@xcite it is a well - known fact that oxidizer composites respond easily to an external stimulus such as impact or friction due to their sensitivity to mechanical energies.@xcite the explosive properties of chlorate - based energetic compositions were reported at the end of the 18@xmath4 century on mixtures of potassium chlorate with sugar and sulfur.@xcite kclo@xmath0 would be an ideal choice as oxidizer because of its ability to sustain at low reaction temperatures , kinetic stability at its melting point , and compatibility with energetic materials.@xcite it is more appropriate to use kclo@xmath0 in pyrotechnic mixtures due to its lower energy content and the combustion behavior .",
    "dong and liao et al@xcite investigated the thermal decomposition process of the kclo@xmath0-rdx and kclo@xmath0-hmx composite materials and proved that energy release of mixtures exceeded that of pure rdx and hmx , respectively by 10% and 40% .",
    "in addition , their study also revealed that the presence of kclo@xmath0 increases the gaseous products in the decomposition mechanism .",
    "the decomposition process of kclo@xmath0 takes place in two different mechanisms.@xcite @xmath5 @xmath6 at high pressures , the first mechanism is almost inoperative , but the second mechanism is actually favored , since the mixture of the decomposition products is denser than kclo@xmath0 itself .",
    "this process is relatively simple and the reaction mechanism is also easy to obtain .",
    "kclo@xmath0 provides a large amount of free oxygen radicals in its thermolysis process which is used to oxidize the energetic intermediates produced by thermal decomposition of explosives .",
    "kclo@xmath0 is an ionic molecular solid with a positive oxygen balance of 39.2%,@xcite which crystallizes in the primitive monoclinic structure having space group _ p2@xmath2/m _ with lattice parameters a = 4.6569@xmath7 , b = 5.59089@xmath7 , c = 7.0991@xmath7 , @xmath8 = 109.648@xmath9 and z = 2 at ambient conditions.@xcite the electronic structure and optical properties of kclo@xmath0 were reported by zhuravlev et al@xcite and vorobeva et al,@xcite respectively .",
    "high pressure studies on molecular crystals are interesting because the effect of pressure on intermolecular bonds is predominant over intramolecular bonds.@xcite so far , several raman and ir measurements have been performed on kclo@xmath0 at ambient as well as at extreme conditions.@xcite the raman studies reveal that kclo@xmath0 undergoes a pressure induced structural phase transition from ambient monoclinic ( phase i ) to rhombohedral ( phase ii ) structure about 0.7 gpa,@xcite or above 1 gpa.@xcite moreover , recent high pressure x - ray diffraction study ( xrd)@xcite shows that kclo@xmath0 undergoes a rapid decomposition below 2 gpa , and it slowdown above 2 gpa because of structural phase transformation from phase i to ii . fundamental properties such as structural and dynamical stability are still not fully understood due to lack of theoretical data at ambient as well as at high pressures for kclo@xmath0 .",
    "further , these properties will be of help in understanding the decomposition mechanisms of kclo@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we have systematically investigated the effect of pressure on crystal structure and lattice dynamics of kclo@xmath0 by means of the first principles calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly describe the methodology of our calculation . in section iii ,",
    "the structural and vibrational properties of kclo@xmath0 at ambient as well as at high pressure are discussed . finally , in section iv , we summarize the results .",
    "cambridge series of total energy package ( castep)@xcite has been used to perform the first - principles calculations of kclo@xmath0 using plane wave pseudopotential ( pw - pp ) approach based on dft.@xcite we used norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite for electron - ion interactions .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite were used to treat electron - electron interactions in kclo@xmath0 .",
    "the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) minimization scheme@xcite has been used for structural relaxation .",
    "the plane wave basis orbitals used in the calculations are 3@xmath10 , 3@xmath11 , 4@xmath12 for k ; 3@xmath10 , 3@xmath13 for cl and 2@xmath10 , 2@xmath14 for o. the convergence criteria for structural optimization for both phases i and ii of kclo@xmath0 was set to ultrafine quality with a kinetic energy cutoff of 1000 ev and 2@xmath150.04 @xmath16 separation of k - mesh according to the monkhorst - pack grid scheme.@xcite the self - consistent energy convergence was set to 5.0@xmath1710@xmath18 ev / atom .",
    "the convergence criterion for the maximum force between atoms was 0.01 ev / a . the maximum displacement and stress were set to be 5.0@xmath1710@xmath19 and 0.02 gpa , respectively .",
    "the standard lda ( ca - pz ) and gga ( pbe ) functionals are inadequate to predict the long range interactions in molecular crystalline solids.@xcite however , the weak van der waals interactions play a key role in determining the physical and chemical properties of molecular solids . in order to account for the long range interactions in the molecular solids , semiempirical dispersion correction schemes have been developed and incorporated in the standard dft description . in the present study ,",
    "we have used g06 scheme@xcite implemented through the gga functional ( pbe+g06 ) , which is an empirical correction to dft taking into account the dispersive interactions based on damped and atomic pairwise potentials of the form c@xmath20@xmath17r@xmath18 .",
    "we have systematically studied the effect of semiempirical dispersion correction scheme on the structural and vibrational properties of the kclo@xmath0 at ambient as well as at high pressure along with the standard dft functionals , which are discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "xrd studies on single crystals of kclo@xmath0 reveal that the phase i of kclo@xmath0 possesses distorted nacl - type structure with low symmetry , crystallizing in the primitive monoclinic crystal structure with _",
    "p2@xmath2/m _ space group . by taking experimental crystal structure as input,@xcite",
    "we performed full structural optimization of the kclo@xmath0 including lattice parameters and internal coordinates using standard lda and gga functionals .",
    "it is found that the calculated volume is underestimated by 12.6@xmath1 within ca - pz and overestimated by 7.5@xmath1 within pbe functionals when compared to experimental volume and thus , the pbe volume is relatively closer to experiment than ca - pz .",
    "as discussed in section i , the phase i of kclo@xmath0 has two molecules per unit cell , which are held together through the weak van der waals interactions in the crystal structure , which leads to the large discrepancy between the calculated ground state parameters and the experimental data .",
    "thus the standard exchange - correlation potentials used in the calculations do not capture the nature of non - bonded interactions in such molecular solids .",
    "therefore , we performed structural relaxation with the semiempirical dispersion correction scheme pbe+g06 , to account for the non - bonded interactions in our calculations .",
    "the optimized equilibrium crystal structure of phase i of kclo@xmath0 is shown fig 1a .",
    "the calculated lattice constants , and volume with the standard dft functionals and semiempirical dispersion correction scheme are summarized in table i and the fractional co - ordinates are given in table i ( see supporting information ) .",
    "the obtained equilibrium lattice constants and volume using the pbe+g06 are in very good agreement with the experiment@xcite and the corresponding ca - pz and pbe values show large deviation from the experimental results at ambient pressure .",
    "the investigation of energetic materials at high pressure are challenging because they possess complex chemical behavior and there is a risk of decomposition .",
    "however , theoretical modeling and simulations are efficient tools to predict physical and chemical properties of complex energetic solids at high pressure as a complement to experiments in modern physics , chemistry and materials science .",
    "raman spectroscopic measurements and high pressure xrd studies reveal that kclo@xmath0 undergoes a pressure induced phase transition from phase i @xmath3 ii about 0.7 gpa,@xcite 1.0 gpa@xcite and above 2.0 gpa.@xcite there is an inconsistency between the experiments@xcite with regard to the transition pressure of kclo@xmath0 . in order to resolve this issue ,",
    "first principles total energy calculations were performed based on dft , which is a powerful tool in predicting the behavior of solid state systems at ambient as well as at high pressures . as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , the calculated enthalpy difference shows that phase i transforms to phase ii about at 0.11 and 3.57 gpa using ca - pz and pbe , respectively .",
    "it is well known from the literature@xcite that the ca - pz functional usually underestimates transition pressures , whereas the gga overestimates the same .",
    "the same trend is observed in our present calculations for kclo@xmath0 , where the ca - pz functional severely underestimates the transition pressure , whereas the pbe functional overestimates when compared to the experimental transition pressure _ i.e. _ , above 2 gpa.@xcite however , the van der waals corrected pbe+g06 functional provides reliable transition pressures for molecular solids.@xcite in the present study , the pbe+g06 functional reproduces the transition pressure accurately in contrast to the standard ca - pz and pbe functionals , and this in very good agreement with the experimental transition pressure.@xcite    the calculated lattice parameters a , b , and c of phase i and lattice parameter a of phase ii are shown in fig .",
    "3a as a function of pressure .",
    "it is clearly observed that all lattice parameters in both phases decrease monotonically with increasing pressure .",
    "but , the angles of both phases ( @xmath8 in phase i and @xmath21 in phase ii ) increase monotonically over the studied pressure range .",
    "3b shows the pressure dependence of volume and there is a 6.4% volume collapse at 2.26 gpa .",
    "this is consistent with experimental results as the ambient phase transforms to a @xmath226@xmath1 denser phase ii@xcite of kclo@xmath0 , which indicates the first order nature of phase transition .",
    "we also predicted the cell parameters of phase ii at 3 gpa , which crystallizes in the rhombohedral structure with _",
    "( z = 1 ) space group ( see fig .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters a = 4.1789@xmath7 and @xmath21 = 84.95@xmath9 are in good agreement with experimental data at @xmath223.5 gpa , a = 4.201@xmath7 and @xmath21 = 84.80@xmath9.@xcite all structural parameters of phase ii are presented in table ii along with experimental data.@xcite in addition , the pressure - volume data of phase ii are consistent with high pressure xrd data.@xcite    as discussed in an earlier section , the first decomposition mechanism ( see section i ) of kclo@xmath0 is as follows : phase i of kclo@xmath0 undergoes a rapid decomposition@xcite to give b1 form of kcl and oxygen ( o@xmath23 ) as the decomposition products at lower pressures ( @xmath24 2 gpa ) and this is ineffective at high pressures .",
    "the present study reveals that phase i transforms to phase ii at 2.26 gpa , which is in good agreement with experimental transition pressure and this structural transition is responsible for the slowdown of the decomposition process of kclo@xmath0 above 2 gpa.@xcite .",
    "since kclo@xmath0 transforms from phase i to ii above 2 gpa , the second decomposition mechanism ( see section i ) is favorable at high pressures .",
    "johnson et al@xcite reported the detailed thermal decomposition of phase ii of kclo@xmath0 , which produces b2 form of kcl and oxygen ( o@xmath23 ) via orthorhombic kclo@xmath25 .",
    "therefore , one can confirm that the kclo@xmath0 can be used as an oxidizer due to release of o@xmath23 as one of its decomposition products for oxygen deficient energetic materials like tnt ( -74.00% ) , hns ( -67.60% ) , hmx ( -21.62% ) , and rdx ( -21.60%).@xcite    .calculated lattice parameters ( a , b , and c ) , monoclinic angle ( @xmath8 ) , volume ( v ) , density ( @xmath26 ) , bond lengths , and bond angles of phase i of kclo@xmath0 using lda , gga and dispersion corrected pbe+g06 functionals along with experimental data.@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath27reference.@xcite , @xmath28reference.@xcite , @xmath29reference.@xcite      to investigate the dynamical stability of phase i of kclo@xmath0 under hydrostatic pressure , we have systematically studied the effect of pressure on zone center external ( lattice ) and internal phonon modes using pbe and pbe+g06 functional to complement the high pressure raman and ir measurements.@xcite the calculated phonon density of states ( phdos ) using pbe+g06 at 0.0 and 2.2 gpa are shown in fig .",
    "the low frequency modes ( below 200 @xmath30 ) are due to both potassium and chlorate ions , whereas modes above 400 @xmath30 are due to the chlorate anion alone .",
    "the modes shif towards a high frequency region around 2.2 gpa . as illustrated in fig . 5 , the low frequency raman ( m1 to m9 ) and ir ( m10 to m15 ) active lattice modes soften under hydrostatic pressure , except m7 lattice mode which is hardening under pressure .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of dispersion correction ( g06 ) through the pbe functional significantly affects the lattice modes at ambient as well as at high pressure .",
    "however , the internal modes are not much affected with the dispersion corrected pbe+g06 functional , which can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "6 . since , the bond lengths ( cl - o1 and cl - o2 ) within the clo@xmath0 molecule are almost unchanged by the inclusion of dispersion correction ( pbe+g06 ) to the standard pbe functional ( see table i ) , the corresponding clo@xmath0 internal vibrations using pbe and pbe+g06 are found to be comparable with each other ( see table iv and fig .",
    ". a similar kind of behavior is observed for energetic molecular crystals such as rdx and hmx at ambient pressure.@xcite the dispersion corrected methods are successful in predicting the lattice vibrations thus enabling comparison to experiments .    the optical modes in the frequency range between 450 - 620 @xmath30 i.e. , m16-m18 and m22-m24 are found to be slightly modified with the application of pressure , whereas the high frequency internal modes such as m19-m21 and m25-m27 are found to increase linearly with pressure .",
    "overall , we observe that all lattice modes increase with pressure upto 0.6 gpa and remain almost constant between 0.6 - 0.8 gpa .",
    "we also find a sudden decrease in all the raman and ir active lattice modes from 1.0 to 1.2 gpa , which may results in the dynamical instability of phase i of kclo@xmath0 under pressure . as evident from fig .",
    "5 , all the raman and ir active lattice modes do not vary significantly with pressure after 1.2 gpa , which might be the reason for coexistence of the two phases from 1.0 gpa up to transition pressure ( 2.26 gpa ) .",
    "hence , we confirm that the transition starts at about 1.0 gpa due to softening of lattice and completes at 2.26 gpa ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . thus , low symmetry phase i ( _ p2@xmath2/m _ ) undergoes a pressure induced structural phase transition to high symmetry phase ii ( _ r3 m _ ) , which agrees quite well with the recent experimental results using x - ray diffraction analysis.@xcite further , a detailed lattice dynamical calculations are required to understand the vibrational effects which are responsible for the structural phase transition in kclo@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , first principles calculations were performed to investigate the high pressure behavior of kclo@xmath0 .",
    "standard dft functionals such as lda and gga are unable to account for the non - bonded interactions in this molecular solid ( see table i ) .",
    "however , the calculated ground state properties using semiempirical dispersion correction scheme ( pbe+g06 ) are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "it is found that kclo@xmath0 undergoes a pressure induced structural phase transition from phase i to ii and the calculated transition pressures using ca - pz and pbe functionals are 0.11 and 3.57 gpa , respectively .",
    "the ca - pz severely underestimates the transition pressure whereas pbe overestimates it .",
    "however , the calculated transition pressure using pbe+g06 functional is 2.26 gpa , which is in good accord with a recent high pressure x - ray diffraction study .",
    "the transition is associated with a volume contraction of 6.4@xmath1 , which indicates a first order type phase transition and this is found to be consistent with experimental reduction of @xmath226@xmath1 .",
    "the calculated single crystal elastic constants show that phases i and ii are mechanically stable .",
    "the calculated single crystal bulk modulus ( 42.58 gpa ) and compressibility ( 2.41@xmath1710@xmath31 gpa@xmath32 ) of phase ii are in excellent agreement with experiments .",
    "we also calculated the zone center phonon frequencies at ambient and at high pressures upto 2.2 gpa to investigate the dynamical stability of phase i of kclo@xmath0 .",
    "we observe the softening in the raman and ir active lattice modes under pressure using pbe+g06 functional .",
    "overall , the present study reveals that the softening of lattice of phase i starts after 1.0 gpa and it completely transforms to phase ii at 2.26 gpa , which agrees quite well with recent experimental results .",
    "therefore , the present study confirms that the pressure induced phase transition leads to a change in the decomposition mechanisms of which also supports recent experimental observations.@xcite +   +",
