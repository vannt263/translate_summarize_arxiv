    "a particular issue in testing these hypotheses will be to determine the @xmath21 mixing angle for the axial mesons . in the chiral symmetry picture@xcite this",

    "it is moot whether there is any simple mixing angle involving the @xmath11 and @xmath22 or whether a further axial with mass @xmath23gev is called for .",

    "subsequent to the above discoveries , selex@xcite reported a narrow state @xmath25 seen in @xmath26 and @xmath17 with a branching ratio @xmath27 .",
    "the narrow width and the anomalous branching ratios ( the two channels share the same quark flavours and phase space favours the @xmath17 mode over the @xmath28 ) led to suggestions that this state may be a tetraquark@xcite . within the more conservative   picture it was noted that the radially excited @xmath29 is predicted to lie at @xmath30 gev and that the presence of nodes in the wavefunction could lead to suppression of certain modes if the decay momentum coincides with a node in momentum space@xcite .",
    "such dynamics have been applied to the decays of excited   states@xcite and also to light flavours with some success@xcite ; however , ref.@xcite found that such an explanation would only work if extreme values for the parameters were chosen and thereby concluded that the selex state might be an artefact .",
    "while we still agree with that conclusion , it does raise the possibility that narrow states could in principle occur if their masses and decay kinematics cause the momenta to coincide with nodes ; this is one of the questions that we pursue in this survey .",
    "independent of these tantalising possibilities , the transitions among excited hadrons can determine their dynamics and discriminate among models . with the production of charm in b",

    "similarly , b decays may be a significant source of @xmath33 mesons and can be used to test axial mixing .",
    "decay ratios such as @xmath34/@xmath35 are useful probes of the flavour structure of the @xmath4 meson .",

    "novel radiative transition selection rules are obtained in the heavy quark limit .",
    "radiative transitions such as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 can test molecular models in the @xmath48 sector . for example , the width of the intermolecular transition @xmath49 kev contrasts with the @xmath50 kev rate predicted for   states .",
    "anomalous branching ratios of excited states , for example , @xmath51 being much larger than @xmath18 or @xmath42 , may be used to probe the nodal structure of hadron wavefunctions .",
    "we proceed with a description of the strong decay model and the conventions concerning state mixing .",
    "this is followed by a discusson of the phenomenology of the strong decay results and their relationship to the heavy quark limit .",
    "the penultimate section concerns radiative transitions and highlights their utility as a diagnostic tool .",
    "all transition rates are contained in appendices b and c ; tables [ e1d ] , [ e1ds ] , and [ m1d ] for radiative transitions and tables [ dectab1][dectab8 ] for strong transitions .",
    "the @xmath52 model of strong decays assumes that @xmath53 pairs are created with vacuum quantum numbers@xcite .",
    "thus the interaction may be written as    h_q |q = _ f 2 m_f d^ 3 x |_f _ f  , where @xmath54 is a dirac quark field of flavour @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the constituent quark mass , and @xmath57 is a dimensionless pair production strength .",
    "recent variants of the @xmath52 model consider modifications of the pair - production vertex  @xcite , or assume that pair creation originates in a gluonic flux tube@xcite .",
    "the latter is the  flux - tube decay model \" , which in practice gives very similar predictions to the @xmath52 model .",
    "the model has been extensively applied to meson and baryon strong decays , with considerable success@xcite .",
    "the pair - production strength parameter @xmath57 is fitted to strong decay data , and is roughly flavor - independent for decays involving production of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 pairs . a typical value",
    "obtained from computation of light meson decays is @xmath61@xcite , assuming simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wavefunctions with a global scale , @xmath62 ",
    "@xmath63 gev .",
    "the present work also assumes sho wavefunctions but applies the formalism to a variety of heavy - light mesons ; thus we have allowed the sho @xmath64 values to vary according to the state ( see table [ betatab ] in appendix [ app1 ] ) .",
    "these values were obtained by equating the root mean square ( rms ) radius of the sho wavefunction to that obtained in a simple nonrelativistic quark model with coulomb+linear and smeared hyperfine interactions .",
    "details are provided in the appendix .    in view of this",
    "it is appropriate to refit experimental data to obtain a new value for the coupling , @xmath57 .",
    "a total of 32 experimentally well - determined decay rates have been fit with the model .",
    "several variations of the decay model were also examined .",
    "details and the final parameters and method are discussed in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "heavy - light mesons are not charge conjugation eigenstates and so mixing can occur among states with the same @xmath65 that are forbidden for neutral states .",
    "these occur between states with @xmath66 and @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "for example the @xmath69 axial vector @xmath70 and @xmath48 mesons @xmath71 and @xmath72 are coherent superpositions of quark model @xmath73 and @xmath74 states ,    @xmath75    quantifying the mixing pattern as a function of flavour will give information about the internal dynamics ; little is known empirically at present . in the heavy quark limit @xmath76 there is an explicit prediction for the mixing angle assuming that it is generated by spin - orbit interactions ( see section [ hqsect ] ) .",
    "one of our aims will be to devise tests for determining this mixing in practice for heavy , but finite flavour masses .",
    "mixing between @xmath77 states with the same @xmath78 also occurs for @xmath79 and @xmath80 states : @xmath81 degrees and @xmath82 degrees , upon converting their mixing conventions to ours .",
    "@xmath2-wave mixing angles were not computed .",
    "finally , the physical @xmath4 and @xmath83 are taken to be    @xmath84    a typical quark model @xmath4 mixing angle is @xmath85 degrees .",
    "see section [ etasect ] for further discussion on how to interpret the amplitudes for @xmath4 production .",
    "we proceed with a discussion of ozi allowed strong decays of @xmath2 and @xmath3 states .",
    "@xmath86 decays are interesting because the open channels are so close to threshold that isospin symmetry breaking mass shifts become important .",
    "in particular @xmath87 may decay to both @xmath88 and @xmath89 , but the @xmath90 mode of @xmath91 is closed .",
    "the experimental @xmath87 widths are in the ratio        absolute rates are given in table [ dectab1 ] where one sees that the @xmath87 widths are under - predicted by a factor of three .",
    "this is the largest error we have encountered with the @xmath52 model ; for example the analogous decay @xmath95 is under - predicted by approximately 45% in amplitude . while this would be easy to correct by adjusting the @xmath52 coupling , we choose to retain the fit value of appendix [ app1 ] since it does well globally .",
    "we note that the decay model is tuned for sho wavefunctions and decays of momenta of hundreds of mev .",
    "thus it is perhaps no surprise that the largest error seen in the @xmath52 model is seen in this extreme , near - threshold , decay .",
    "it is convenient to discuss heavy - light mesons in the @xmath96 coupling scheme .",
    "one has @xmath97 for the heavy quark which must combine with the light quark spin and angular momentum to form a total @xmath65 state . in the p - waves @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus the @xmath100 states form a doublet with @xmath101 while the @xmath102 states form a @xmath103 doublet .",
    "the relationship of these states to those in the @xmath104 coupling scheme can be determined once the heavy quark dynamics has been isolated and conventions have been fixed .",
    "we chose to employ the conventions of ref.@xcite .",
    "this reference also discusses the other conventions for the mixing angle that have appeared in the literature . in the heavy - quark limit a particular  magic \" mixing angle follows from the quark mass dependence of the spin - orbit and tensor terms , which is @xmath105 @xmath106 if the expectation of the heavy - quark spin - orbit interaction is positive ( negative ) @xcite .",
    "since the former implies that the @xmath107 state is greater in mass than the @xmath0 state , and this agrees with experiment , we employ @xmath108 in the following .",
    "this implies      in practice the empirical mixing for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems is not yet known .",
    "quantifying this is one of the challenges that we discuss here for both and systems .",
    "for example , our decay model makes specific predictions for certain amplitude ratios :      which underpin the eventual extraction of the mixing angles .",
    "these relationships imply that the heavy quark @xmath111 state of eq .",
    "[ axmix ] couples to @xmath112 in @xmath113-wave , whereas the @xmath114 heavy quark state couples in @xmath2-wave .",
    "thus one expects the @xmath33 ( @xmath115 ) to be broad ( narrow ) in the heavy quark limit .",
    "similarly , eq . [ ratios ] implies that the the @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) mode will be large ( small ) in @xmath118 decays and the @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) mode will be small ( large ) in @xmath119 decays .",
    "table [ dectab1 ] give the predicted widths of the @xmath33 and @xmath120 states in terms of the mixing angle ( @xmath121 denotes @xmath122 ) .",
    "equating these to the measured rates of @xmath123 mev and @xmath124 mev gives very good fits for mixing angles of @xmath125 or @xmath126 .",
    "the first angle is the solution for a broad @xmath33 while the second is for a broad @xmath120 .",
    "since these correspond to @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively , good agreement is obtained with the heavy quark predictions , although distinguishing the two scenarios is impossible .",
    "this agreement may be tested by measuring decays with @xmath33s in the final state .",
    "the decay tables indicate that the most promising such decays are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath130 , and @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the situation for the @xmath44 is less satisfactory because both the @xmath44 and @xmath134 states are expected to be narrow due to the limited phase space available for the @xmath18 channel .",
    "the heavy quark @xmath52 model prediction for the @xmath134 width is 800 kev .",
    "model uncertainties can be removed by measuring the ratio        the @xmath1   states can be directly produced by the @xmath140 axial current in @xmath141 or @xmath142@xcite , thus b factories offer the possibility of studying these intriguing states .",
    "however , heavy quark symmetry suppresses the @xmath99 @xmath1 decay constant@xcite so that production of the @xmath134 may be negligible .",
    "furthermore there is no conserved vector current suppression of the scalar   due to the different masses of the @xmath121 and @xmath143 in such transitions and hence the @xmath144 may also be detectable .",
    "the relative production of these states in @xmath7 decays will provide further insight into the relationship between the various   states with @xmath145 .",
    "for example , the enigmatic @xmath144 is produced in @xmath146 and @xmath147 decays to @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively ; with the former having a branching fraction of approximately 17% .",
    "this is sufficiently large that it may worth looking for .",
    "one expects that these branching fractions would be substantially lower if the @xmath144 state were a molecule .",
    "in addition to the curious @xmath150 and @xmath1 states in the   system , there are also questions in the charmed @xmath2 states .",
    "a simple problem is the existence of incompatible candidates for the @xmath0 states at 2308 and 2407 mev@xcite .",
    "the   state may be produced directly in @xmath7 decay as above , but with the additional penalty of cabibbo suppression .",
    "it is also possible to produce the @xmath24 in @xmath146 and @xmath151 decays .    finally ,",
    "as noted in the introduction , it has been suggested that the anomalously low masses of the @xmath9 and @xmath11 are consistent with breaking heavy quark and chiral symmetry@xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath16 .",
    "presumably this relationship applies to @xmath152 and @xmath153 states and hence the mass of the broad @xmath154 state should employed . for the @xmath3 system one",
    "obtains 349 mev and 347 mev for the left and right sides of the equation .",
    "although not considered by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , in principle this relationship applies to the @xmath2 system as well .",
    "the @xmath155 mass difference is measured to be 347 mev and the @xmath156 mass difference is 349 mev if the lighter belle @xmath24 mass is used . thus",
    ", if taken seriously , this relationship supports the belle results .",
    "we stress that it is important to test the applicability of this model through measurements of other observables , including the @xmath111 mixing angle .",
    "all @xmath65 combinations of @xmath86 can be produced in decays such as @xmath157 , and the hadronic analogues , though transitions to states where the light degrees of freedom are in highly excited states will be suppressed by poor wavefunction overlaps and restricted phase space .",
    "the production of excited @xmath158 and @xmath159 should be feasible as they can be emitted from the @xmath140 in weak transitions such as @xmath160 : the form factor that is relevant here is driven by the wavefunction at short distances .",
    "a simple quark model computation confirms that the wavefunction at the origin is not strongly suppressed as the principle quantum number increases , and the recoil momentum is sufficiently low that there is very little dependence on the @xmath161 transition form factor .",
    "thus , the rate @xmath162 depends primarily on the phase space and one finds that the relative emission rates are      as the branching ratio @xmath164 and @xmath165 are each approximately 1%@xcite one expects a total production of @xmath166 at roughly 1% . and",
    "even the doubly excited @xmath6 will have a branching fraction of order @xmath167 .",
    "the charmed analogue @xmath168 is cabbibo suppressed and can be expected at the @xmath167 level . as noted in the previous section , the axial and scalar   states can be produced in this way .",
    "for example , the @xmath159 @xmath169 can also be produced ; its decay is predicted to be almost entirely into @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore advocate that these states should be sought at high statistics @xmath7-factories .",
    "the signatures for the vector states are as follows .",
    "the   @xmath166 decays dominantly to @xmath170 and @xmath171 with traces of @xmath26 and @xmath172 .",
    "the @xmath173 channel is closed ; to access the @xmath33 this way requires the @xmath174 initial state ( see the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "the charmed @xmath168 decays dominantly to @xmath175 and @xmath176 with traces of @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the first excited vector @xmath179 and @xmath180 arise in either @xmath29 or @xmath181 configurations and in general there can be mixing between these .",
    "such mixing will tend to shift the masses of the eigenstates away from the simple potential model values of figs .",
    "[ spect],[spect2 ] .",
    "the unperturbed masses for @xmath6 of @xmath182 or @xmath183 imply that one of these eigenstates will be kinematically forbidden to decay to @xmath184 while the other will be allowed . in the latter case",
    "there are interesting nodal effects , whose character will depend on the mixing angle .",
    "similar remarks hold for the   states and the decays to @xmath185 .",
    "however in this case the small pion mass implies that the @xmath185 channel may be open for both initial states .",
    "the role of decays of these states in determining the @xmath1 mixing angles by decays to @xmath186 was discussed in section [ hqsect ] .",
    "the @xmath0 1p state is clearly @xmath187 , so there is no mixing problem with this final state in the transition from @xmath188 . thus the @xmath0 may be accessed via this transition from a @xmath189 produced in b decay .",
    "so given a @xmath189 emitted from the w current in b decay , one may access the @xmath0 state by the above transition .",
    "the analogous @xmath190 production is cabibbo suppressed and it decays dominantly to @xmath191 ; the @xmath169 analogously decays to @xmath18",
    ". it would be interesting to study transitions to the analogous @xmath3 states and determine whether the @xmath9 and @xmath11 are   or other compounds .",
    "this would require the initial state to be 3s in order to be kinematically open .",
    "the second of these is an example of the @xmath52 selection rule forbidding such transitions among spin singlets@xcite .",
    "we note that , in analogy with the @xmath5-waves , the amplitude ratios above imply that the @xmath198 decays strongly in @xmath5 wave while the @xmath199 decays only in @xmath200 wave and is thus narrower than the @xmath198 . as with @xmath5-waves",
    ", this conclusion agrees with spin conservation in the heavy quark limit .",
    "unfortunately , the ability to distinguish the states is weakened by the many other decay modes which exist for these states .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath198 and @xmath199 have total widths which depend strongly on @xmath201 and measurement of any ( or several ) of the larger decay modes will provide ( over ) constrained tests of the model and measurements of the mixing angle .",
    "finally we note that the transitions @xmath202 and @xmath203 proceed in @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 waves , but never share a wave .",
    "thus there is no @xmath208 mixing due to @xmath209 loops .",
    "the effects of wavefunction nodes can be seen in figs .",
    "[ g_ds_star_p ] and [ g_dspp ] . here",
    "the partial widths are plotted for fixed @xmath64 as a function of the mass of the initial state . for the @xmath179",
    ", nodes would significantly affect the total width if the mass were roughly 3.1 mev .",
    "alternatively , nodes directly affect the width of the @xmath151 by suppressing the @xmath18 , @xmath42 , and @xmath210 modes while enhancing the @xmath211 mode .",
    "the figure indicates that a @xmath151 at 3.3 gev would have a substantial branching fraction to @xmath210 while one at 3.4 gev would have no @xmath211 mode .",
    "clearly these effects must be accounted for in the phenomenology of heavy - light mesons .",
    "similar remarks apply here as to the @xmath212 waves with the bonus that phase space for decays into the @xmath213 states is open leading to potential measures of the axial mixing angle ( tables [ dectab5 ] and [ dectab8 ] ) .",
    "the challenge is to produce a significant sample of these @xmath214 states in @xmath7-decays .",
    "our estimate of the branching ratio @xmath215 ) \\sim 10^{-3}$ ] suggests that this may be feasible .",
    "decays to @xmath216 are predicted to be @xmath217 , which may provide a significant source of the axial charmed mesons and a measure of their mixing .",
    "decays to @xmath218 and @xmath219 may also be measured and used to test if the @xmath11 is the   partner of the @xmath220 or an independent state such as a @xmath18 molecule .",
    "the decays of @xmath151 and @xmath221 can access the enigmatic @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "for example , comparison of the predicted rates for @xmath36 and @xmath222 will test the putative   nature of the axial states .    in the charm @xmath2 system",
    "the decays @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath223 measure the axial mixing angles .",
    "a robust prediction of the model is that the sum of the two axial decay modes should be roughly @xmath224 times as large as the @xmath223 mode .",
    "finally , the status of @xmath225 and @xmath226 candidates may be tested by searching for them in the @xmath227 and @xmath228 decay modes of the @xmath146 where they have a non - negligible branching fraction .",
    "the emission of an @xmath4 in @xmath229 transitions is kinematically allowed , while @xmath83 emission is forbidden .",
    "alternatively both are permitted in @xmath230 transitions .",
    "we note that the flavour flow in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems probes the quark content of the @xmath4 s .",
    "thus @xmath4 s are produced via their content in the  system , whereas in   decays it is the   components that are involved .",
    "thus a comparison of   @xmath231 +   and  @xmath232  probes the   content weighted by phase space and form factor effects . a rather direct measure of the vs.   content of the @xmath4 can be obtained by comparing @xmath233 or @xmath234 though the predicted branching ratios are small .",
    "the predictions in appendix c for @xmath4 and @xmath83 production assume that these states are equally weighted mixtures of   and   .",
    "hence with conventions for the @xmath4 wavefunction specified above , the amplitude ratio @xmath235 and @xmath236 is @xmath237 .",
    "this is modified by different wavefunctions , different quark masses , and different meson masses .",
    "direct computation gives the factors shown in table [ etatab ] ; these should be multiplied by @xmath238 to obtain physical amplitude ratios .",
    "determining several of these amplitude ratios will provide a constrained measure of the mixing angle and the efficacy of the decay model ."
