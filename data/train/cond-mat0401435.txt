    "as the temperature of a supercooled liquid is lowered the dynamics of relaxation slows down dramatically , leading eventually to an effective breakdown of ergodicity .",
    "the increasing inability of the system to sample the whole phase space in experimental timescales can be traced back by looking at the evolution in phase space , or equivalently , by observing the mobility of particles in real space .",
    "slow dynamics and the difficulty to become ergodic as the temperature is lowered implies , for a glass former , an increasing confinement in configuration space or the reduction in the mobility of individual particles . from a topographic view of the glass behavior , at low temperatures",
    "a glass former will evolve in a rough landscape and its dynamics will be influenced by the presence of many points of local mechanical equilibrium , called inherent structures  @xcite , among which the system will wander during increasing times as the temperature is decreased .",
    "thus , in this picture , confinement is a natural consequence of the non trivial structure of the landscape at low temperatures .",
    "however , confinement may be also due to a strong reduction of allowed paths , not related to the underlying potential energy landscape ( pel ) but , instead , to purely dynamical constraints . nevertheless , a non trivial landscape is not necessary in order to observe other glassy features .",
    "for example , in a model of traps with a random distribution of energies in an otherwise flat landscape , dynamics proceeds exclusively through activation over energy barriers , and it shows several glassy features , like non - exponential relaxation , aging and a glass like transition @xcite . nevertheless , by construction it is clear that no confinement in configuration space is possible in this model .",
    "the introduction of inherent structures ( is ) ( local minima of the pel ) @xcite , which divide the phase space into basins of attraction , allows the separation of vibrational motion from the more fundamental structural transitions .",
    "activation over barriers between inherent structures and the escape through saddles with many unstable directions in the potential energy landscape are the relevant mechanisms for relaxation from a landscape perspective .    in a previous work @xcite we introduced time correlation functions between inherent structures that display useful information on the relaxation properties of glassy systems , like different dynamical regimes and stretched exponential relaxation .",
    "but more interestingly they clearly show the signature of confinement in configuration space as temperature is lowered and allow one to distinguish between different systems with glassy properties . for a lennard - jones binary mixture ( ljbm ) , these correlations present two well separated time regimes , respectively corresponding to the exploration of the interior of the basin of a particular is and to the neighborhood of that basin @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the correlations as temperature is lowered implies the emergence of a strong confinement in configuration space , which is absent when the same functions are computed for a walker moving in a cubic lattice of traps @xcite . in this paper",
    "we compare the behavior of these correlations for several prototypical models of glass formers and glassy behavior : the lennard - jones binary mixture ( ljbm ) , the trap model and two kinetically constrained ising models . while all four systems display many of the characteristic features of supercooled liquids and glasses , clearly the physical mechanisms behind their complex behavior are very different .",
    "the ljbm is a very much studied molecular glass former with a complex landscape responsible for its glassy behavior at low temperatures .",
    "the trap model , on the other hand , has a trivial landscape , like a flat golf court with holes with a random distribution of depths . both the symmetrically ( scic ) and asymmetrically ( acic ) constrained ising chain @xcite",
    "are intermediate between the previous two extreme models : while the landscape responsible for the thermodynamics is trivial , the dynamics is defined independently of it in order to restrict severely the possible paths in phase space , therefore producing a very interesting glassy behavior . our results point to a common mechanism for relaxation in the lennard - jones and the kinetically constrained models while the trap model behave in a completely different way , reflecting the difference in the structure of the effectively sampled phase space .    in section [ correlations ]",
    "we define the time correlation functions between inherent structures analyzed in this work . in section [ lj ] and [ traps ]",
    "we briefly discuss the results for the bljm and trap model ( for details see ref .  ) . in section [ kinetic ]",
    "we present and discuss our results for the kinetically constrained ising chains and finally in section [ final ] we present our conclusions .",
    "every instantaneous state of the system may be associated with an is of the energy landscape . in the ljbm , for example , following a zero temperature steepest descent path starting at the equilibrium initial state , the final state corresponds to the is .",
    "we have observed that in this case , the is can be identified by their energy since degeneracies ( interchange of two particles of the same kind , for example ) are quite unusual and has no significant statistical weight . on the other hand , in a spin model",
    "the inherent structures correspond to configurations that are stable under single spin flip dynamics . as a consequence , in the kinetically constrained ising models is correspond to configurations with _",
    "isolated defects_. in order to compute the is in these models we start from an equilibrium configuration at temperature @xmath0 and turn all excitations down , performing a quench at zero temperature until the stable configuration is attained . at variance with the hamiltonian ljbm , in the kinetically constrained models the final inherent structures reached are not unique given an initial equilibrium configuration .",
    "instead the final point depends on the actual path of single spin flips in the zero temperature dynamics .",
    "nevertheless we verified that for different single spin flip paths the final averaged quantities of interest , the correlations in this case , are invariant . in the trap model , by construction , every configuration corresponds to an is .",
    "once the is is obtained , we measure equilibrium correlation functions that provide information on how confined in a region of the configuration space is the system .",
    "the first of these correlations , @xmath1 , measures the probability of being in the same is at two different times .",
    "more precisely , given the is corresponding to the configuration at @xmath2 , we define @xmath1 as the probability that the system _ is at the same _ is after a time @xmath3 , irrespective of where the system was in between : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inherent structure configuration at time @xmath6 and with the sum we perform an average over the @xmath7 available times .",
    "another possible measure , @xmath8 is the probability of staying in the same is for all times between 0 and @xmath3 , the persistence : @xmath9 where the productory is restricted to the interval @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "these correlation functions are size dependent .",
    "we showed in @xcite that in the ljbm the behavior is in agreement with the assumption that the whole system is divided into nearly independent subsystems with a typical length scale .",
    "this allows one to rationalize the results for different sizes .",

    "knowing that it has departed at least once during this time interval_. this probability shows two important characteristics : first , there is a characteristic time at which the probability of returning to the original is is maximal .",
    "this time scale grows when temperature is lowered : if the system goes out of a basin it takes more time to return as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the second feature is more important : the returning probability * grows * as the glass transition is approached .",
    "this is a signature of _ confinement in configuration space_.",
    "the model of traps in a @xmath22-dimensional hypercubic lattice is realized as a random walk of a particle hopping between traps attached at each lattice site with a given trap energy distribution @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "depending on this distribution , different interesting dynamical behaviors are observed .",
    "if the energies are exponentially distributed the model has a dynamical phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath24 below which it presents typical glass phenomenology , such as aging effects .",
    "the trap model has been proposed as a phenomenological model for describing the physics of structural and spin glasses . from a physical point of view",
    "the dynamics proceeds through activation over barriers corresponding to the depth of the traps . besides the difference in the depths ,",
    "the landscape can be considered flat , structureless .",
    "thus , in this case , we associate a trap to a basin and study the probability that the system returns to a given basin ( trap ) .",
    "we considered two and three dimensional lattices , and assigned to every site a trap of energy e that is determined randomly from an exponential distribution of the form @xmath25 .",
    "the energy associated to a given site is kept fixed during the simulation , i.e. when the walker returns to a given site it finds the same trap ( quenched - disorder case @xcite ) .",

    "the behavior is qualitatively the same in both cases .",
    "the figure shows a characteristic time that increases as the temperature is lowered , analogously to figure  [ dif_lj ] for the ljbm . in the case of the trap model ,",
    "the maximum of the probability of returning to a given trap moves towards increasing times as temperature is lowered because the walker stays for increasing times in the traps of the surroundings .",
    "the confinement can only be attributed to the time spent by the walker in the individual traps since every trap is spatially equivalent to each other , there is no spatial confinement as the walker moves in a flat landscape .",
    "but the fact that distinguishes more the trap model from the ljbm is the fact that the peak probabilities for returning _ decrease as the temperature is lowered_. for lower temperatures , if the walker goes out of a trap , the probability to come back diminishes as a direct consequence of the lack of structure of the landscape in which it moves , which is effectively flat .",
    "in this section we consider a class of models that , in some sense , are intermediate between the ljbm with its complex landscape and the trap model with its flat landscape .",
    "kinetic ising models with dynamic constraints are defined as a set of spins @xmath34 on a @xmath22-dimensional lattice without an explicit interaction hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "complex behavior arises through the dynamics defined in such a way that a spin can flip only if it satisfies a constraint imposed on the number of nearest neighbors up spins .",
    "the dynamic rules are chosen such that the equilibrium distribution corresponds to that of a system of free spins in an external field : @xmath35 from the thermodynamic point of view , this model is trivial and its landscape is structureless .",
    "being irreducible in the phase space , the equilibrium properties correspond to those of a paramagnet in a field : there is no phase transition and the concentration of up spins , @xmath36 , is a decreasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , since up spins are those that facilitate the dynamics , it becomes slower as @xmath0 decreases . in other words , the introduction of constraints in the dynamics , independent of the hamiltonian , forces the system to evolve through a subset of paths in space - time which becomes increasingly limited as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the system needs to bypass energy barriers in order to relax and this induces an effective roughness in the landscape .",
    "strong entropic effects are introduced exclusively by the dynamics , while it is important to note that almost all configurations are allowed , detailed balance is fulfilled , and ergodicity guaranteed @xcite . both equilibrium and non - equilibrium dynamics of these models have been extensively studied @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . recently , a real space - time interpretation of the dynamics of glass formation has been put forward @xcite based on observations on these kind of models . in this view , the up spins are interpreted as regions of enhanced mobility while down spins are nearly frozen regions",
    ". these regions are coarse grained both in time and space such that no interaction is left and we get the effective one body hamiltonian , eq .",
    "these mobile regions , or defects , separate different domains ( as defined in @xcite ) and the dynamics is described in terms of creation and annihilation of defects , which induce a coarsening of domains . at any temperature",
    "there is a typical lengthscale of the domains @xmath37 , and the glass transition occurs at @xmath38 , where this lengthscale diverges .",
    "we consider a @xmath39 chain of @xmath40 spins with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a spin can flip according to the following rules : @xmath41    this model presents several characteristic relaxation times , all of an arrhenius form , the slower one ( the equilibration time ) growing with temperature as @xmath42 . in this sense",

    "[ scicfig]b we see the two time regimes observed also in the ljbm .",

    ", width=207,height=294 ]    in figure [ dif_scic ] we show @xmath20 for this model .",
    "besides the growing characteristic time scale with decreasing temperature we observe a tendency to saturation in the value of the peak probability , which implies that the degree of confinement becomes nearly independent of @xmath0 at low temperatures .",
    "one can rationalize this behavior , clearly different from what is observed both in the ljbm and in the trap model , by analyzing the microscopic dynamics of defects .",
    "the mechanism of relaxation is the coarsening of domains . only with the annihilation of defects",
    "the energy can be reduced . from an initial inherent structure ,",
    "the scic is able to coalesce two domains into one by diffusing the defects separating them . in order to diffuse a single defect from an",
    "is it is necessary to excite a neighbor site creating a new defect , what costs an energy equal to unity .",
    "once two defects are together then it is possible to relax this structure in both directions and in this way allow the defects to diffuse .",
    "this climbing of an energy hill of unit height and then relaxing again can go on , until the diffusing defect meets another one .",
    "then one of them is annihilated and the collapse of two domains happens .",
    "we can see that , although the typical size of domains grows with decreasing temperature , the typical cost in order to collapse domains is always the same , as it is only necessary to go up and down by steps of cost 1 in order to diffuse and eventually relax . in other words ,",
    "the confinement does not grow with decreasing temperature , because energy barriers are temperature independent .",
    "this produces a saturation in the typical probability that the system returns to the initial inherent structure at low temperatures .",
    "clearly this behavior is different from the one observed in the ljbm and help us to understand the process of relaxation in that model too .",
    "one could guess that energy barriers do grow with decreasing temperature in the ljbm , inducing a growing confinement .",

    ", there is a directionality in the dynamics of defects . in order to collapse two defects initially separated by a sequence of down spins",
    "the only possibility is to propagate the defect on the left until it reaches the spin in the right . but this propagation can not proceed by simple diffusion as in the scic .",
    "new excitations have to be created and anchored until the defect on the right is reached .",

    "the complete process has an energy cost @xmath56 which depends on the length of the domain @xmath57 , given by @xcite :    @xmath58    consequently energy barriers in the acic are temperature dependent through the dependence of @xmath59 and grow with decreasing temperature .",

    "it may be thought as having a flat landscape filled with holes of random depths .",
    "the correlations show that lowering the temperature the probability for the system to return to an is diminishes since there is no mechanism forcing it to stay in a region except the residence time inside the traps .",
    "the model that is next in complexity is perhaps the symmetrically constrained ising chain , a model of a strong glass .",
    "this model behaves differently from the trap model in that it shows a growing probability to return to an is at lower temperatures , an evidence of the non trivial character of the configuration space .",

    "the typical barriers that the system has to cross in order to coalesce two domains grow with decreasing @xmath0 , differently from what happens in the scic .",
    "this points to a common origin of relaxations in the acic and in the ljbm .",
    "it is clear that although the acic posses a trivial equilibrium measure , the constraint imposed on the dynamics makes it evolve in an effective non trivial landscape . in the ljbm",
    "this effect is more fundamental , it comes directly from the microscopic interactions which produce a higly non trivial energy landscape which is in turn the ultimate origin of the complex glassy dynamics in this system . in summary",
    ", we found that for models where the evolution follows by cooperative rearrangements , there is an increase in the returning probability , that is , a stronger confinement .",
    "we also expect that this is a rather general property , and should be valid in other systems depending on the cooperativeness of the dynamics ."
