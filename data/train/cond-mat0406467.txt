    "the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model describes a gas of interacting bosons hopping across the sites of a discrete structure .",
    "it was originally introduced@xcite to study the the superfluid - insulator quantum phase transition in liquid helium , and later argued to describe the physics of an array of coupled bose - einstein condensates ( becs).@xcite such proposal has been strikingly substantiated by a recent breakthrough experiment,@xcite where the superfluid - insulator transition was observed in a @xmath0rb bec array .",
    "this result greatly reinvigorated the studies on the quantum phase transition characterizing the bh model.@xcite indeed , the ongoing progress in condensate trapping techniques promises an unprecedented control on the parameters of the experimental realizations of such model .",
    "a simple example in this respect is supplied by the quite direct relation between the intensity of the laser beam trapping the condensates at the sites of the so - called _ optical lattice _ and the tunneling interaction between neighbouring condensates , accounted by the hopping amplitude in the relevant bh hamiltonian.@xcite recently , several proposals have been brought forward concerning the realization of bec arrays characterized by non - trivial layouts .",
    "suitable laser setups , possibly with different wavelengths , can be used to generate optical superlattices.@xcite techniques borrowed from holography@xcite or from semiconductor technology@xcite have been proposed for the creation of optically or magnetically confined inhomogeneous bec arrays .",
    "the bh model is also commonly used to describe josephson junction arrays@xcite ( jjas ) , which can be easily arranged according to non - trivial layouts , including inhomogeneous ones.@xcite in this case the phase transition can be observed measuring different samples or adjusting an external magnetic field applied to the same sample.@xcite    in the light of this , the need arises for the study of a bh model characterized by a generic hopping term .",
    "a further point of interest in this respect is provided by the unexpected features induced by topological inhomogeneities in the properties of discrete boson systems@xcite even in the absence of boson interaction.@xcite    for the study of the zero - temperature phase diagram of the bh model several techniques have been adopted .",
    "qualitatively correct results are provided by numerical@xcite and analytical@xcite mean - field approaches . as it is well known , even for relatively small systems the formidable size of the hilbert space rules out the route of direct diagonalization in the study of the ground state properties of the bh hamiltonian , determining the features of the zero - temperature phase diagram . in the case of homogeneous systems ,",
    "clever numerical methods have been devised that provide quite satisfactory results . however , since they rely on features such as self - similarity@xcite or translational invariance , @xcite their generalization to topologically inhomogeneous structures is at least problematic .",
    "of course , the superfluid - insulator transition on such structures can be studied exploiting the flexibility of quantum monte carlo simulations , that provide the most general and reliable numerical approach .",
    "indeed , this technique was successfully applied to the case of regular lattices@xcite , possibly in the presence of inhomogeneities arising from random@xcite or harmonic@xcite local potentials .",
    "recently , some results addressing inhomogeneous hopping have been reported.@xcite as to analytical approaches , the strong coupling perturbative results reported in ref .",
    "allow a quite satisfactory description of the zero - temperature phase diagram of the bh model on regular bipartite lattices , possibly with disorder .    here",
    ", we extend the third - order perturbative results of ref .   to a generic structure , possibly non - bipartite and/or topologically inhomogeneous .",
    "we remark that commonly investigated regular lattices , such as the triangular@xcite or the kagom@xcite lattice , are non - bipartite .",
    "we show that in the general case two further significant third - order contributions appear in the perturbative expansion of the ground state energy of the system , and of the boundaries of the mott lobes thereof .",
    "furthermore we show that terms arising from inhomogeneous hopping amplitudes appear in the expansion of a physically interesting quantity such as the local density of bosons already at the first perturbative order .",
    "we also supply some examples where the new terms play a significant role .",
    "the hamiltonian for the _ pure _ bh model on a generic structure comprising @xmath1 sites has the form @xmath2\\ ] ] where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the boson annihilation ( creation ) operator at site @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the relevant number operator , @xmath7 is the boson repulsion strength and @xmath8 is an overall scaling factor controlling the magnitude of the possibly inhomogeneous hopping matrix , @xmath9 . since the latter contains information about the connectivity of the underlying structure , it is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the so - called adjacency matrix , whose generic entry @xmath12 equals one only if sites @xmath5 and @xmath13 are adjacent , and zero otherwise .",
    "hence topological inhomogeneity can come in the form of a non - trivial connectivity , i.e. a site dependent coordination number @xmath14 , and/or in the form of uneven hopping amplitudes @xmath15 .",
    "we remark that this applies also to periodic structures , such as the inhomogeneous kagom lattice in fig .",
    "[ f : z4 ] ( c. ) or the @xmath16 lattice of ref .  .",
    "note that hamiltonian ( [ e : bh ] ) commutes with the total number of bosons , @xmath17 .",
    "hence the properties of its ground state @xmath18  i.e. the state minimizing @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the chemical potential controlling the boson population  can be conveniently studied considering one number eigenspace at a time .",
    "the competition between the on - site repulsion and the kinetic energy  proportional to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively  produces a well - known zero - temperature phase diagram in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane , where a series of adjacent mott - insulator lobes appears . outside these lobes",
    "the cost of changing the total number of particles in the system by a finite amount vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "conversely , within the mott lobes , adding or subtracting a single particle always costs a finite amount of energy , and the total boson population is commensurate to the size of the structure , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the left and right boundary of the filling-@xmath27 mott lobe are customarily evaluated as the ground - state energy gaps @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the ground state energies of @xmath32 when the total population is @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "following ref .",
    ", in the sequel we term the latter two _ defect states _ and label `` def '' quantities relevant to either of them .    in ref .",
    "the quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ e : mu ] ) are quite satisfactorily approximated by a third - order strong coupling perturbative expansion , the perturbative parameter being @xmath22 .",
    "such results carry an explicit dependence on the hopping matrix @xmath9 and , quite interestingly , on its maximal eigenvalue and eigenvector .",
    "this means that the influence of topology , algebraically described by @xmath9 , can be in principle singled out explicitly in the perturbative expansion of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "however , the perturbative results reported in ref .   apply only to homogeneous bipartite lattices , whose hopping matrix is such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "actually , since such expansions are limited to the third order , the latter constraint can be weakened , and only regular lattices featuring triangular loops have to be excluded , @xmath40 . in this respect",
    "we mention that third order results have been reported for the particular case of the regular triangular lattice in the presence of a magnetic field.@xcite",
    "in the following we provide the complete third - order strong coupling perturbative expansions for the quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ e : mu ] ) , obtained including those terms arising from the presence of triangular loops and topological inhomogeneities in the discrete structure underlying the bh model .",
    "such terms , pertaining to the third perturbative order , are denoted `` @xmath41 '' and `` @xmath42 '' , respectively .",
    "quite interestingly , the latter depends not only on the maximal eigenpair of the hopping matrix , but on its entire spectrum @xmath43 , @xmath44 .    for commensurate fillings , @xmath45 ,",
    "the energy of the ground state is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the previously reported result@xcite , while @xmath48 takes into account triangular loops , but it does not affect the boundary of the mott lobe , since an identical term appears in the energy of defect states . indeed , the latter has the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the correct third - order result when triangular loops and hopping inhomogeneities are absent.@xcite in detail , introducing the matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52})_{j h } = t^p_{j h}$ ] and @xmath53 , one gets @xmath54,\\ ] ] @xmath55 } { \\mathbf f}_1   + \\lambda_1 ^ 3 \\big ] \\big \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where def denotes the defect state complementary to def .",
    "as it is clear from table  [ t : coeffs ] , the previously unreported,@xcite third - order terms , @xmath56 appearing whenever triangular loops are present , and @xmath57 ^ 2}{4 u^2 c^{(1)}_{\\rm def } } \\sum_{k=2}^{m } \\frac{\\left ( { \\mathbf f}_1 \\cdot \\zeta { \\mathbf f}_k\\right)^2}{\\lambda_1-\\lambda_k}\\ ] ] arising from topological inhomogeneity , can contribute significantly to the perturbative expansion of @xmath58 , and hence of eqs .",
    "( [ e : mu ] ) .",
    "note that , similar to the previously known terms,@xcite @xmath59 depends on the maximal eigenvector of @xmath9 only .",
    "conversely @xmath60 depends on all of the eigenvectors @xmath61 and eigenvalues @xmath62 of @xmath9 .",
    "of course @xmath59 vanishes on structures lacking of triangular loops , where @xmath63 .",
    "likewise , @xmath60 vanishes on structures where @xmath64 , such as regular lattices,@xcite since @xmath65 .    .[t",

    "the perturbative corrections , obeying the hierarchy of equations @xmath72 are then expanded on the eigenfunctions of @xmath73 .",
    "note that the ground state of the latter is non - degenerate for commensurate boson populations , @xmath74 , and @xmath1-fold degenerate in the number eigenspaces relevant to defect states , @xmath75 .",
    "hence we conveniently set @xmath76 , where the quantities denoted by latin letters refer to the @xmath77-dimensional lowest eigenspace of @xmath73 , while those denoted by greek letters refer to the remaining eigenstates .",
