    "quantum cloning and quantum state distinguishability are two important and closely related areas in quantum information theory .",
    "the no cloning theorem @xcite says that only orthogonal quantum states can be cloned perfectly in principle and only when the required operations are performed on the entire system .",
    "but if we restrict ourselves to locc(local operation and classical communication ) then further restrictions on cloning apply .",
    "for example , the very obvious first restriction will be that an entangled blank state is needed to clone an entangled state .",
    "the locc cloning of entangled states was first introduced by ghosh _",
    "@xcite where it was shown that any two orthogonal two qubit maximally entangled states can be cloned under locc with the help of one ebit of entanglement",
    ". however , there exist two orthogonal two qubit non - maximal entangled states which can not be cloned under locc with the help of one(or less ) ebit of entanglement @xcite .",
    "so the relation between amount of entanglement present in the unknown states and possibility of cloning of those entangled states under locc is not simple as sometimes locc cloning of two qubit less entangled states of a particular type is not possible with any two qubit entangled state as a blank copy .",
    "thus the study of locc cloning of orthogonal entangled states becomes interesting when the ensemble states are not maximal .",
    "this study is also important because locc cloning is very closely connected with many important information processing tasks , such as channel copying , quantum key distribution , error correction , entanglement distillation and is also helpful in understanding the nonlocality of a set of states@xcite .",
    "most work in this area is for bipartite ( maximally and nonmaximally ) entangled states @xcite .",
    "although some results are known for local copying of a set of orthogonal three qubit maximally entangled states @xcite , no result is known for non - maximally entangled states .",
    "we , in this letter concentrate on locc cloning of orthogonal _ _ cat states _ _ , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e. _ , an unequal superposition of two orthonormal basis states.]@xcite .",
    "+ we organize our paper as follows : in section ii , we prove that no set of orthogonal three qubit cat states can be cloned by locc with the help of any three qubit cat state having the same amount of entanglement in the blank copy .",
    "we also prove that the cloning remains impossible for the set of states having a pair of kind ( [ 3ghzi ] ) even if we supply any three qubit state as a blank copy . in section iii",
    ", we extend the result to n - qubits and identify the class for which locc cloning is possible with the help of a ghz state .",
    "the possibility of locc cloning of a pair of orthogonal n - qubit ghz state is also discussed .",
    "the full orthogonal canonical set of three qubit cat states can be written as ( up to a global phase ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 , also the bar over a bit value indicates its logical negation . for @xmath5 , or @xmath6 the state @xmath7 ( given in ( [ ghzs ] ) ) represents a three qubit ghz , or a product state respectively . + from a recent result @xcite on local cloning of bipartite entangled states one can say that the necessary condition for locc cloning of a set of pure n - qubit entangled states with the help of a known n - qubit pure entangled state is that all states belonging to this set must have equal entanglement .",
    "this is due to the fact that , if the locc cloning of n - partite states is impossible with @xmath8 cooperating parties , it remains impossible with n independent parties .",
    "so for locc cloning we always consider a set which contains states with equal entanglement .",

    "a necessary condition for cloning of a three qubit state under the usual locc ( where each of the three qubits of the state is independently manipulated ) would be that :  the states should remain copyable when two of the three qubits are operated on jointly at one place whereas the third qubit undergoes a separate local operation at a different place and there can be classical communication between these two places \" .",
