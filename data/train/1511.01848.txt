    "we begin with a `` chromatin fiber '' of 5,000 30-nm beads  representing 15-mbp  diffusing amongst 30-nm `` transcription factors '' ( fig .",
    "initially , `` transcription factors '' ( hereafter factors ) have no affinity for any bead in the fiber ( which follows a self - avoiding random walk ) , but then binding is `` switched '' on so they now have a high affinity for every 20@xmath1 bead ( pink ) , and a low affinity for all others ( emulating the tight binding of transcription factors to cognate sites and non - specific binding elsewhere ) .",
    "importantly , factors can bind to two ( or more ) beads , and affinities are just large enough to favor binding . consequently",
    ", a factor often binds to a low - affinity site , dissociates , and rebinds nearby .",
    "as this process repeats , the factor may reach a high - affinity site and remain bound long enough to stabilize a loop ( fig .",
    "1a ) ; bound factors now spontaneously cluster ( fig .",
    "1b , c ; movies s1 and s2 ) .",
    "the force driving analogous clustering after non - specific binding was dubbed the `` bridging - induced attraction '' ; it operates even though no explicit attraction between factors or between beads was specified , and it was not seen with monovalent factors or irreversible binding  @xcite .",

    "clusters form in @xmath41 min ( one simulation time unit is 0.6 ms , calculated assuming a nuclear viscosity of 10 cp ) , and the fraction of pink beads in clusters increases rapidly ( fig .",
    "[ we define two beads to be in the same cluster if centers lie within 90 nm . ] small clusters then slowly grow to reach a steady - state size with  12 factors / cluster ( fig .",

    "it is likely that such `` coarsening '' is also dynamically hindered , as merging two clusters of loops ( even when thermodynamically favored ) , would require passage over a free - energy barrier due to inter - loop interactions .",
    "similar growth rates are found with all fibers described , and are not discussed further .    as `` rosettes '' of loops",
    "are often found in models of chromosomes  @xcite , we developed a suitable plot  a `` rosettogram ''  to assess how many existed in our simulations ( fig .",
    "s1p ) . in a rosettogram",
    ", there is a row for every cluster , and a column for every high - affinity bead in a cluster ( other beads are not shown ) ; then , a red pixel marks the presence of a binding bead in a cluster , and increasing numbers of abutting red pixels in a row reflect increasing numbers of loops ( `` petals '' ) involving near - neighbour high - affinity sites . in figure 1f ,",

    "however , the second organizes a `` perfect '' rosette with 14 petals around high - affinity beads 21 , 41 , 61 , @xmath6 , 281 ; here , contacts display `` transitivity ''  @xcite , with one loop running from bead 21 to 41 , another from 41 to 61 , and a third from 21 to 61 via 41 .",
    "in contrast , `` overlapping loops '' ( of the type running directly from bead 21 to 61 , and from 41 to 81 ) are rarely seen here or in hi - c data  @xcite . as most rows contain adjacent pixels , and as 80% pink beads share a cluster with a nearest - neighbour pink bead , a measure of the disorganization ( i.e. , the disorganized fraction , @xmath7 ) is low ( fig .",
    "s1 ; table s1 ) . in other words , rosettes and local contacts",
    "are common .",
    "clusters form if low - affinity sites are omitted ( fig .",
    "s2a ) ; therefore , `` sliding '' from low- to high - affinity sites is not required for clustering . however , the contact map , rosettogram , and @xmath7 all point to a more disorganized structure . randomly scattering the same number of high - affinity sites along",
    "a fiber creates more regular strings of rosettes ( fig .",
    "s2b ) , presumably because gaps between successive binding sites are exponentially distributed so that binding sites are naturally clustered nearer together in 1d genomic space ( this is the so - called `` poisson clumping '' ) . clusters and rosettes also form with a higher concentration of chromatin ( i.e. , in the `` semi - dilute '' regime  @xcite , see also below and fig .",
    "s5 ) .      binding of different factors to different beads was now analyzed . in figure 2ai ,",
    "green factors interact only with light - green beads , and red ones only with pink beads .",
    "again , no attraction is specified between factors , or between beads .",

    ", s4 ) . as before ,",
    "clusters reach a steady state , but now with only @xmath08.1 bound factors / cluster ; the regular alternation of green and red binding sites renders cluster merging entropically more costly . moreover , the contact map , rosettogram , and @xmath7 all point to a more disorganized structure than those seen previously ; for example , there are now many `` overlapping '' loops where the fiber passes back and forth between a cluster of red factors to another with green ones ( fig . 2aiii , iv ) .",

    "the inset shows a high - resolution map involving only binding beads in clusters ; contacts are scored ( without binning ) if bead centers lie 90 nm apart ( not 150 nm ) , and any binding beads are treated as if they possess the color of factor binding them . here",
    ", red , green , and yellow pixels mark contacts between two pink beads , between two light - green beads , and between a light - green and pink bead , respectively .",
    "similarly - colored pixels rarely abut in a row , as the fiber passes back and forth between differently - colored clusters .",
    "( iv ) final rosettogram ( pixels correspond to binding beads , and are colored as in the contact map zoom ) ; rows rarely contain abutting pixels of one color ( reflected by a high fd ) .",
    "( b ) how `` specialized '' clusters form .",
    "( c ) red , green , dark - blue , purple , and black factors ( 500 of each ) bind ( 7.1 kbt ) to five sets of cognate sites scattered randomly along 20 identical fibers ( each with 2,000 beads representing 6 mbp ) .",
    "the snapshot ( taken after 5@xmath310@xmath2 units ; dna not shown for clarity ) shows that each factor tends to cluster with similarly - colored ones .",
    "see also figure s5 . ]",
    "such self - organization into structures rich in certain dna - binding proteins but not others is commonplace in nuclear biology ( see discussion ) .",
    "but what might drive this extraordinary self - assembly into `` specialized '' clusters in the absence of any explicit interaction between factors , or between beads ?",
    "we suggest there are both entropic and kinetic drivers  @xcite , and that the following one is important .",
    "thus , early during the simulation in figure 2a , a structure like that in figure 2b might arise .",
    "red protein @xmath9 is tightly bound to two pink beads , and so will rarely dissociate from the cluster ; however , if it does it is likely to bind to a nearby pink bead ( as there are so many ) .",
    "further , as red protein @xmath10 and binding bead @xmath11 diffuse by , both are likely to join the same cluster ( again because of the high local concentration of appropriate binding sites and factors ) .",
    "we are now in a positive feedback loop : the local concentration of red factors and pink beads makes it unlikely either will escape , and likely that more of both will be caught as they diffuse by . for the same reason , green protein @xmath12 is likely to bind to the right - hand cluster , and this cluster will tend to grow as other green factors and light - green sites are caught .",
    "red and green clusters will inevitably be separate in 3d space because their cognate binding sites are separate in 1d sequence space , and cluster growth is limited when the entropic costs of bringing together ever - more loops becomes prohibitive .    in figure 2a , red and green binding beads alternate , and overlapping loops",
    "pass back and forth between red and green clusters .",
    "rosettes with many transitive loops result if 200-bead blocks containing 10 light - green beads ( spaced every 20 beads ) alternate with similar blocks containing pink beads ( fig .",
    "as there are fewer binding beads of one color per block than the @xmath012 often found in a cluster in the analogous simulation in figure 1 , successive blocks can form successive red and green clusters . unsurprisingly",
    ", the 1d organization determines rosette and loop type .",
    "distinct clusters also form if more factors and more fibers are introduced .",
    "in figures 2c and s5 , 5 differently - colored factors bind to distinct cognate sites scattered randomly along 20 fibers .",
    "distinct clusters again form ; 53% contain factors of only one color , and in @xmath1380% more than @xmath1380% binding beads have the same color ( fig .",
    "s5v ) . such clustering could underlie the high number of contacts seen between co - regulated genes that utilize the same factors  @xcite .",
    "inter - fiber contacts are rare ( fig .",
    "s5iv ) , as in hi - c data  @xcite .",
    "however , they constitute a higher fraction if just contacts made by binding beads in clusters are considered ( fig .",
    "this is reminiscent of contacts made by active genomic regions ; for example , most contacts made by ( active ) _ samd4a _ are inter - chromosomal ( assessed by 4c  @xcite ) , as are most ( active ) sites binding estrogen receptor @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "[ figure s5 gives effects of the threshold used to define contacts on contact frequencies . ]    the affinities of transcription factors for cognate sites are often tightly regulated , often by post - translational modification . changing factor affinity was simulated using a fiber in which every 20@xmath1 bead was yellow ( fig .",
    "s6 ) . initially , red factors bind to yellow beads , and red clusters form .",
    "then , we switch on an attraction between green factors and yellow beads that is stronger than the red - yellow attraction ; consequently , green factors compete effectively with red ones , and red / green and all - green clusters develop .",
    "this provides a precedent for how one nuclear body ( e.g. , a transcription factory ) might evolve into another .",
    "topological domains are recognized as `` pyramids '' in contact maps prepared using data from hi - c  @xcite ) or simulations  @xcite .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that the pattern of binding beads in our fibers determines whether pyramids are seen .",
    "for example , figure 3a illustrates a partial contact map obtained using data from figure 1 .",
    "as clusters appear stochastically and tend to persist , a specified bead often clusters with different partners in different simulations .",
    "then , pyramidal patterns , which are visible in a single run ( analogous to hi - c data from a single cell ) , become blurred on averaging results from progressively more simulations ( fig . 3aii ) .",

    "only regions around the ( horizontally - placed ) diagonal are shown ; axes give bead numbers ( blue ) .",
    "[ figure s7 shows complete contact maps . ]",
    "( a ) clustering of factors does not necessarily lead to domains .",
    "( i ) red factors bind with high - affinity to every 20th bead ( pink ) , and with low affinity to others ( blue ) .",
    "( ii ) although pyramids are seen in the contact map after 1 run , averaging data from 20 runs blurs patterns . ( b ) gene deserts . (",
    "i ) blocks of 400 binding beads ( blue and pink ; every 20th bead is pink ) alternate with blocks of 100 non - binding beads ( grey ) ; red factors bind to blue and pink beads with low and high affinity , respectively .",
    "( ii ) each pyramid coincides with a block of pink and blue beads , and is separated from the next by a disordered region .",

    "( i ) blocks of 300 light - green and 100 pink beads alternate ; red and green factors bind to pink and light - green beads , respectively .",
    "( ii ) large pyramids alternate with small ones , reflecting reproducible assembly of blocks into domains .",
    "( d ) loops . (",
    "i ) the fiber is pre - organized into loops by forcing selected beads ( green rectangles ) to bind irreversibly ; this results in 324-bead loops separated by 300 unlooped beads ( plus 150 unlooped ones at each end ) .",
    "all beads are pink , and red factors can bind to any bead .",
    "loops are initially torsionally relaxed ( i.e. , linking number , lk , @xmath150 ) .",
    "( ii ) pyramids are less well defined than in ( b ) and ( c ) , but nevertheless tend to coincide with loops ( see also fig .",
    "( e ) supercoiled loops .",
    "( i ) as ( d ) , but each loop has a linking number of + 32 .",
    "( ii ) loops form pyramids that are more distinct than in ( d ) . ]    in a homogeneous fiber , pyramids disappear on averaging because domains form stochastically ; however , if the fiber is suitably patterned , domain boundaries form at specific locations . for example , if long blocks in which every 20@xmath1 bead is pink ( binding red factors ) are interleaved with short blocks containing non - binding grey beads ( representing gene - poor `` deserts '' ) , pink beads cluster but grey ones do not ; then , many contacts are seen between pink beads to give pyramids sitting exactly on long segments ( fig .",
    "3b ) . here , boundaries between domains are located within grey segments .",
    "domains are also seen if segments containing 300 successive pink beads ( binding red factors ) are interleaved with shorter segments containing 100 light - green beads ( binding green factors ) ; in this case , a repeating pattern of large and small pyramids is seen , with boundaries between blocks of differently - colored beads ( fig .",
    "this simulation could mimic binding of polymerizing complexes and hp1@xmath14 ( hetero - chromatin protein 1@xmath14 ) to repeats of eu- and hetero - chromatin  @xcite .",
    "[ these results confirm and extend those obtained using monte carlo simulations of just one segment of each type  @xcite . ] these runs of binding beads give larger clusters ( i.e. , @xmath040 red factors / cluster , and @xmath015 green factors / cluster ) . when the fiber is forced permanently into loops ( perhaps maintained by ctcf )",
    " and if red factors can bind to any bead  pyramids ( which are more blurred than in fig . 3b and c ) tend to sit over each loop ( fig .",
    "3d  @xcite ) ; this is reminiscent of hi - c data  @xcite .",
    "therefore , domains can form in a non - uniform genomic landscape ( fig .",
    "3b , c ) , and if there are loops ( fig .",
    "if loops are preformed into left - handed ( or right - handed ) inter - wound supercoils  @xcite , pyramids are more sharply defined ( fig . 3e",
    "; see also  @xcite ) .",
    "because our fibers form many ( @xmath1310 ) domains , we can analyze contact maps away from the diagonal : these clearly show that in all cases where domains form , inter - domain interactions are weaker than intra - domain ones ( compare fig .",
    "s7b- e )  as in hi - c data .",
    "[ note that many domain : domain interactions seen after one run ( fig .",
    "s7f ) disappear ( or become fainter ) after averaging data from many runs ( fig .",
    "s7b ) . ]",
    "the probability that two loci yield a hi - c contact decreases as the number of intervening base pairs increases  @xcite , and the exponent ( @xmath14 ) in the power law varies from -0.5 ( in hela  @xcite ) to -1.6 ( in embryonic stem cells  @xcite ) .",
    "[ @xmath14 = 1 in the fractal globule model  @xcite . ] in all simulations in figure 3 ( except for fig . 3a ) , there are two regimes  below and above the domain size ( the largest of the two domains appears to set the scale ) with @xmath14 between -0.6 and -1 ( strong interactions within a pyramid / domain ) or close to -2 ( weaker interactions between pyramids / domains ; fig .",
    "therefore our values are similar to those seen experimentally .",
    "our results are also consistent with the exponent ( seen in simulations of uniform fibers ) varying with protein number and affinity  @xcite .",
    "we next used various approaches to identify domain boundaries ( fig .",
    "many current approaches are based on what we will call a janus plot ( fig .",
    "s9 ) , which in its simplest form quantifies all contacts that one bead makes with others to the right or the left in 1d genomic space . in figure 3e ,",
    "peaks in the two resulting plots correlate well with the left and right tethers of a loop ( fig .",
    "by subtracting signal from the two plots , we obtain a `` difference plot '' ( i.e. , the number of contacts to the right minus the number of contacts to the left ) . at a boundary",
    ", we expect a bead to switch its contacts , from mostly leftward to mostly rightward ; consequently , boundaries are found at points where signal in the difference plot crosses zero with an upward derivative ( fig .",
    "this is essentially the method used in  @xcite . in the case of figure 3e",
    ", this approach finds domains within loops , and boundaries somewhere in the linear region between them .",
    "a more accurate determination is possible by locating the peaks of the derivative of the difference plot ( the `` insulator '' plot in fig .",
    "this peak - finding algorithm is elegant and works well with highly - sampled contact maps ( as in fig .",
    "however , it works less well with sparser data from simulations and hi - c , where we found the `` difference '' plot gave better results ( so we use it in what follows , aided by visual inspection to fine - tune boundary positions ) .",
    "finally , we examined whether binding of just two proteins to `` active '' and `` inactive '' beads on a 15-mbp fiber ( representing part of chromosome 12 in gm12878 ) could fold the genome appropriately ( fig .",
    "4a ; movies s5 and s6 ) .",
    "active regions were selected using the broad chromhmm track on the ucsc ( university of california at santa cruz ) browser  @xcite , and beads ( 1 kbp ) representing active promoters or strong enhancers ( states 1 , 4 , 5 )  and the bodies of active transcription units ( states 9 , 10 )  were colored pink and light - green , respectively .",
    "these pink and light - green beads bind red factors ( transcription factors , polymerizing complexes ) with high and low affinities .",
    "inactive heterochromatin was represented by grey beads that bind black proteins ( e.g. , dimers of hp1@xmath14  @xcite ) .",
    "heterochromatic beads were identified as those having a low gc content  an excellent and flexible marker ( in principle , choice of threshold can allow any fraction of the region of interest to be classified as heterochromatin ) . here , @xmath441.8% gc was chosen as the threshold , as this led to the same percentage of heterochromatin in the 15 mbp as that marked by state 13 ( generic heterochromatin ) in the hmm track .",
    "other beads ( blue ) were non - binding .",
    "as before , distinct clusters of bound red or black proteins develop with @xmath014 or @xmath0190 proteins / cluster , respectively ( long runs of adjacent grey beads form the larger clusters ; fig .",
    "the resulting contact map was strikingly similar to the hi - c one  @xcite , with simulations correctly predicting 75% of the hi - c domain boundaries to within 100 kbp ( figs 4c , d and s10a , b ; table s2 ) .",
    "boundaries were in this case found using the difference plot aided by visual inspection ( fig .",
    "s10 ) ; purely automated detection correctly locates @xmath059% hi - c boundaries within 100 kbp , which is still statistically significant ( this is an underestimate due to algorithmic errors , some examples of which are noted in fig .",
    "simulations also yield a more - ordered rosettogram than any seen previously ( fig .",
    "s10c ) ; this is consistent with evolution selecting for a genetic and epigenetic sequence that gives ordered rosettes .",
    "similar results were obtained with a 15-mbp segment of a different chromosome ( chr6 ) in a different cell type ( fig .",

    "active and inactive beads ( each now representing 3 kbp ) were defined as before , and heterochromatic ones using @xmath448.4% gc ( to reproduce the fraction of the chromosome bearing the state 13 mark ) .",
    "now , 85% domain boundaries are correctly reproduced to within 100 kbp ( figs 5 , s12a ) . moreover , simulation boundaries are rich in `` active '' and non - binding regions and depleted of `` inactive '' ones ( fig",
    ". 12b ) . as before , the rosettogram and @xmath7 point to a highly - ordered structure with many local contacts ( fig .",
    "s12c ) . at a higher level in the organization , 3d positioning of some domains next to others  reflected by off - diagonal blocks in contact maps  is sometimes reproduced in simulations ( zooms in figs 5c and d , s12a ) .",
    "our simulations of the whole chromosome further indicate that small active domains seem to be often located at the periphery of larger inactive ones ; they also suggest that active domains are more dynamic and mobile than inactive ones ( see movie s7 ) .",
    "these md simulations illustrate some emergent properties of a minimalist system that involves bivalent `` transcription factors '' ( or `` proteins '' ) binding specifically and transiently to cognate sites in a fiber ( representing `` chromatin '' ) .",
    "first , bound factors spontaneously cluster  to compact the fibers ( figs 1 , 2c ) .",
    "this self - organization occurs in the absence of any explicit interaction between factors or between beads , and it is driven by a combination of forces dubbed the `` bridging - induced attraction '' .",
    "second , and more surprisingly , factors binding to distinct sites on the fiber self - assemble into distinct ( segregated ) clusters .",
    "for example , bound red and green factors self - assemble into clusters that contain only red factors , or only green ones  but rarely both ( fig .",
    "these clusters arise because protein binding will inevitably yield clusters in different places in 3d space if  and only if  their cognate binding sites are spatially separated in 1d sequence space ( fig .",
    "third , clustering organizes the loops caused by binding into higher - order rosettes , and domains ( figs 3- 5 ) .",
    "for example , binding of just two `` proteins '' ( transcription and hp1@xmath14 complexes ) to active and inactive regions in a 59-mbp human chromosome folds the fiber to yield a contact map in which @xmath085% of the hi - c boundaries are both correctly placed and rich in the appropriate sequences ( figs 5 and s12 , movie s7 ) .",
    "in other words , complexes bind locally to create loops , bound complexes cluster together with similar ones into rosettes , this folds the fiber globally into appropriate domains , and domains pack against each other  all in the expected ways .",
    "remarkably , then , this minimalist system generates structures that possess all the key features of interphase chromosomes outlined in the introduction .",
    "moreover , the clusters formed are reminiscent of nuclear structures like cajal and promyelocytic leukemia bodies , which are each rich in distinct proteins that bind to different cognate dna sequences  @xcite ; they also closely resemble nucleoplasmic transcription factories that each contain @xmath010 active polymerizing complexes  @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of any one factor is small ( roughly comparable to that in a few h - bonds ) , but extended genomic regions fold simply because so many are involved .",
    "cluster formation and protein - driven chromosome organization also occurs quickly ( within minutes according to our simulations , fig .",
    "once clusters form , they usually persist ( fig",
    "however , the system can evolve when new factors appear ( fig .",
    "s6 ) , much as a transcription factory can develop into a replication factory at the beginning of s phase  @xcite , or into one specializing in transcribing responsive genes during the inflammatory response ( when tumor necrosis factor @xmath14 induces nuclear influx of nuclear factor @xmath16b  @xcite .",
    "contacts made as a result of such clustering involve sites both near and far apart on the fiber .",
    "most contacts are local , to create loops and `` rosettes '' like those often seen in models of chromosomes ( figs 1f , 2aiv , see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest rosettes ( with many transitive loops ) are favoured over more disordered non - local structures ( with many overlapping loops ) partly because the entropic cost is less  @xcite ; rosettes are also likely to be kinetically favoured when starting from knot - free structures ( both in simulations and on exit from mitosis ) .",
    "more distant contacts also depend on patterns of binding sites in 1d genomic space , as domains separated by well - defined boundaries result if non - binding gene deserts or supercoiled loops  @xcite are introduced , or if blocks of eu- and hetero - chromatin alternate ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    in summary",
    ", the bridging - induced attraction provides a robust , simple , and generic mechanism that can concentrate specific proteins bound to cognate sites into clusters , and fold interphase fibers in ways found in vivo .",
    "then , the system must either spend energy to prevent the resulting clustering , or ",
    "as seems likely  it goes with the flow and uses other more or less familiar forces ( charge interactions , h bonds , van der waals , hydrophobic forces , and the depletion attraction  @xcite ) to organize those clusters .",
    "if so , we suggest that the particular folding pattern found in any one nucleus will be largely determined by which transcription factors bind to cognate sites , and which bound factors then happen to co - cluster . we also expect that adding more proteins and fibers to our simple model will improve the concordance between contact maps obtained from simulations and hi - c .",
    "after the present work was completed , two studies proposed another model for formation of looping domains that is based on ctcf bridges  @xcite .",
    "these involve some loop - extruding driving domain formation , and they are appealing because they can account for the recent observation that ctcf bridging depends on the orientation of the cognate binding sites  @xcite .",
    "however , this model requires some as - yet undiscovered motor protein with a processivity sufficient to generate loops of hundreds of kb . on the other hand , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , these studies do not address what might underlie the observed compartmentalization into active and inactive domains - which is naturally explained within our framework by binding of different factors to eu- and hetero - chromatin .",
    "furthermore , knock - outs of ctcf have only minor effects on domain organization  @xcite , which again suggests that this factor can not be the sole organizer .",
    "the results of these knock - outs are also naturally explained by our model , as the compartmentalization is driven by bivalent factors which are unrelated to ctcf . our work and those of refs .",
    "@xcite are therefore complementary , and it would be of interest to couple the two approaches together in the future .",
    "brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations were run with the lammps ( large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator ) code , used with a stochastic thermostat .",
    "chromatin fibers are modeled as bead - and - spring polymers using fene bonds ( maximum extension 1.6 times bead diameter , @xmath17 ) and a bending potential that allows persistence length to be set .",
    "protein : protein and chromatin : chromatin interactions involve only steric repulsion , and those between proteins and their binding sites are truncated and shifted lennard - jones interactions . all beads are confined within a cube with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "additional details are listed in figure legends and/or supplementary information .",
    "simulations of human chromosomes included two kinds of factors / proteins , one binding to active euchromatin and the other to inactive heterochromatin .",
    "chromatin beads were colored pink or light - green if interacting strongly or weakly , respectively , with red factors ( representing factors and polymerases ) , grey if interacting with black proteins ( representing hp1@xmath14 ) , and blue if non - interacting .",
    "the broad chromhmm track  @xcite on the hg19 assembly of the ucsc genome browser was used to determine pink / light green color : ( i ) if a region of 90 bp or more within one bead is labeled as an `` active promoter '' or `` strong enhancer '' ( states 1,4,5 ) then the whole bead is colored pink , similarly if a bead contains 90 bp or more of `` transcriptional transition '' or `` transcriptional elongation '' ( states 9,10 ) it is colored light green .",
    "data for gc content ( figs 4 , 5 and s11d ) or from the hmm track ( fig .",
    "s11a , b ) were used to determine grey color : ( i ) if gc content of the bead was below the threshold specified in each figure legend , or ( ii ) if a region of 90 bp or more within one bead is labelled `` heterochromatin ; low signal '' ( state 13 ) .",
    "this convention allows one bead to have multiple colors .",
    "figure legends give numbers of differently - colored beads in a simulation and affinities .",
    "simulations included red factors ( @xmath18=300 in fig . 4 and fig .",
    "s11 ; @xmath18=400 in fig .",
    "5 ) , and black protein ( @xmath18=3,000 in fig . 4 and fig . s11 ; @xmath18=4,000 in fig .",
    "5 ) ; for simplicity , protein size is equal to @xmath17 , and interaction range to 1.8 @xmath17 .    in our simulations",
    ", one bead corresponds either to 3 ( figs 1 - 3 , 5 ) or 1 kbp ( figs 4 and s11 ) .",
    "these correspond to a size of 30 nm and 20.8 nm respectively ( assuming a 30-nm fiber has a packing density of 1 kbp/10 nm , and the two bead sizes contain the same dna density ) .",
    "persistence length was 3 @xmath17 ( representing a flexible polymer ) , and one time unit corresponds to 0.6 or 0.2 ms ( for 3 or 1 kbp beads ; calculated assuming a viscosity of 10 cp , or 10-fold larger than water ) .",

    "assuming the same chromatin density in the two models , a unit of length now corresponds to 20.8 nm .    in order to map time units ,",
    "we need to recognise that there are three main time scales in the system .",
    "one is the previously defined lennard - jones time @xmath59 .",
    "a second is the inertial time @xmath60 ( from eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) ) , which is the characteristic time over which a bead loses information about its velocity .",

    "@xmath62 is the diffusion constant for bead @xmath19 , given through the einstein relation by @xmath63 .",
    "if we make the approximation that a chromatin bead will diffuse like a sphere we can then use stokes law , where @xmath64 , with @xmath65 the viscosity of the fluid , and @xmath66 the diameter of bead @xmath19 . taking realistic values for the length , mass and viscosity one finds that @xmath67 , with the times separated by several orders of magnitude . for numerical stability",

    "one simulation unit of time ( one brownian time ) corresponds to about 0.2 ms .",
    "for the simulation in figures 3e and 3f , the force field discussed in section  [ forcefield ] was supplemented with torsional interactions to generate results for loops with linking number lk equal to 0 or 32 . to model",
    "supercoiled or torsionally relaxed ( but not nicked ) loops , we use closed loops ( each of contour length 324 @xmath17 ) , which were joined to a linear backbone with a gaussian spring .",
    "we modeled torsional interactions using spherical atoms with an associated triad of vectors , so that the euler angles describing the relative orientation of adjacent beads allow us to track the twist as well as the bending rigidity .",

    "the interaction range ( cut - off of lennard - jones interaction ) was equal to 1.8 @xmath17 for all attractive interactions .",
    "interaction strengths ( @xmath49 , in units of @xmath54 ) were as follows : figures 1 , 3a , 3b and s2b : 7.1 ( between red `` transcription factors '' and pink beads ) ; 3.5 ( between red factors and blue beads ) .",

    "chromatin fibers were first generated as random walks , and proteins randomly distributed ( with uniform probability throughout the simulation box ) .",
    "the simulation was then run with a soft potential between all beads to remove overlaps , and with a gaussian spring between neighboring beads ( this was for at least a million time steps ; in some cases it was also necessary to use a higher bending rigidity to avoid initial entanglements ) .",
    "after equilibration , the force field was set to the one discussed in section  [ forcefield ] . for figures 3e and 3f ,",
    "we first equilibrated supercoiled or torsionally relaxed loops in isolation , then joined them to a linear backbone at appropriate places ( see caption to fig .",
    "3 ) with gaussian springs ; the system was then allowed to equilibrate with the force field in section  [ forcefield ] ( which preserves topology and linking number as it disallows intrachain crossings ) . for figure s5 , we generated initial conformations for the 20 chromatin fibers as mitotic - like cylinders with random orientation , following the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; proteins were still distributed randomly and uniformly at the beginning of the simulations .",
    "the equilibration steps were then performed as above ( with soft potential and gaussian springs ) .",
    "an important output of both hi - c experiments and our simulations are contact maps ; in this section we discuss how we analysed them .    the contact maps in figures 1d , 2aiii , s2aiii , s2biii , s3iii , s4iii , s5iii and s7f were obtained from a single configuration : a contact between two beads was scored if their centers were less than 150 nm ( 5 @xmath17 ) apart .",
    "we binned contacts by dividing the polymer into a number of bins ( specified in each figure legends ) to aid visualization .",
    "the colored contact maps in figures 2aiii , s3iii , s4iii , s5iii and s6iv were also obtained from a single configuration , by only considering the binding sites .",
    "a contact between two binding sites was scored if their centers were less than 90 nm ( 3 @xmath17 ) apart .",
    "binding sites were colored according to the protein ( or factor ) which is attracted to them ( i.e. , pink sites are colored red as they bind red factors , etc . ) ; in case a binding site could be the target for more than one factor ( e.g. , in fig .",
    "s6iv ) , we colored the binding site according to the protein which was closest to them ( e.g. , red if the binding site was closest to a red protein , etc . ) .",
    "pixels in the contact map then are colored red if they are contacts between two red pixels , etc . ; mixed contacts are colored yellow if between red and green , and grey in figure s5iii .",
    "finally , the simulation contact maps in figures 3 , 4 , 5 , s7a - e and s11 , were averaged over several realizations ( specified in the figure legends , together with the binning used ) . in all contacts map ( with the exception of colored contact maps ) , the entry gives the number of contacts in the bin , scaled by the maximum number of contact maps over all bins ( in this way entries are between 0 and 1 ) .",
    "for each of the simulations in figure 3 , we plotted both the whole contact map ( fig .",
    "s7 ) and just the part of it close to the diagonal ( referred to as pyramid plots in the text ) ; the latter is often used in the literature as it allows a clearer visual determination of boundaries .",
    "while the simulated contact maps are shown without any normalization , experimental contact maps for gm12878 cells ( figs 3 and 5 in the main text ) were normalized according to the square root normalization method described in ref .",
    "experimental contact maps for figure s11 were not normalized ; these were computed from the sequence read archives ( sra ) data in the gene expression omnibus [ obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite via access number gse35156 ; duplicate reads were removed ] .    for each of the contact maps ( whether from simulation or experiments ) , we prepared janus and difference plots , and computed the number of contacts ( or contact probability ) versus distance along the genome / simulated chromatin fibers .",
    "all contact maps were binned ( the binning used varied in the different cases and in specified in figure legends ) .",
    "the janus forward signal for bin @xmath19 , @xmath72 , is defined as the sum over all contact map entries relative to contacts which a bead makes with other beads to the right of it : i.e. , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the contact map entry relative to the @xmath19-th and @xmath75th bins , and @xmath18 is the total number of bins .",
    "the janus backward signal for bin @xmath19 , @xmath76 , was similarly computed as @xmath77 .",
    "the difference plot ( figs s8 and s9 ) is the difference @xmath78 .",
    "when this quantity is negative , bin @xmath19 is making more contact to its left ; when it is positive , the majority of the contacts bin @xmath19 makes are to its right .",
    "the difference plot is useful to get a first estimate of domain boundary locations , since boundaries are places where the pattern of contacts made by a bin changes from mostly to the left to mostly to the right ( but not vice versa ) .",
    "therefore , boundaries can be located at regions where @xmath79 crosses 0 with an upward derivative ; a similar algorithm was used to locate boundaries in ref .",
    "this is the base of the algorithm used in figure s9 to determine boundaries automatically in the region chr12:85000000 - 100000000 bp ( fig . 4 in the main text ) .",
    "to avoid spurious multiple nearby boundaries due to noise in the difference plot signal , we further required that either the upward trend in @xmath79 is common to 4 consecutive beads crossing zero , or that the upward slope at the zero crossing ( forward difference @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) is larger than a set threshold ( equal to 10% or 40% of the maximum step in the function @xmath79 , for experiments and simulations respectively ) .",
    "another way to detect boundaries is via peaks in the derivative of @xmath79 ( this is the insulator plot in fig .",
    "s8 ) : the rationale here is that we expect the relative fraction of contacts to the right should increase sharply at boundaries , however due to contacts away from the diagonal it may not necessary be that the difference plot goes through 0 . in selected cases",
    "we also used the recent method described in ref .",
    "@xcite to detect boundaries .",
    "while all methods agreed on some of the boundaries , visual inspection suggests that not all boundaries can be found by any one automated technique ( see figs 4 and s10b ) .",
    "while in hi - c experiments the numerical error that these or similar algorithms make is not too important , it is much more consequential with simulation data that are noisier . moreover , our goal is to compare experimental and simulation boundaries , rather than to estimate boundaries in either simulations or experiments with a given accuracy . comparing boundaries in simulations and hi - c data is a demanding task : for instance , even a two pixel error ( the @xmath79 curve turning in an opposite direction ) would lead to an artificial discrepancy of 80 kbp between the location of the same boundary in simulations and experiments , and missing out boundaries or false detection of boundaries due to noise would give an even more serious reduction in the measure of the agreement between simulations and experiments ( as the number of boundaries which can be located randomly is relatively high , see text ) .",
    "as a result , while the automated detection of boundaries in figure s9 shows that the agreement between simulations and experiments is statistically significant , there are errors in the boundary detection which affect this comparison . to avoid this , we resorted to locating boundaries by visual inspection ( compare fig .",
    "4 with fig .",
    "finally , we discuss some details of rosettograms ( fig .",
    "s1 ) . to build these",
    ", we start from one configuration from the simulation , and divide the binding beads into clusters ; two binding beads are defined to be in the same cluster if their separation is below a threshold ( typically 90 nm , unless specified otherwise )",
    ". then clusters are numbered , starting from the first along the chromatin fiber ( fig .",
    "the rosettogram plots cluster number versus binding bead number , and for clarity we only show the binding beads which are in clusters .",
    "a string of well formed rosettes shows up as a series of continuous lines ( lines made up by contiguous pixels ) in the rosettogram , whereas a more disordered structure with lots of non - local contacts is characterised by breaks in the horizontal lines in the rosettogram ( as binding beads in the cluster will often not be contiguous along the polymer chain ) . to quantify how disordered ( i.e. , how far from an ideal string of rosettes ) the loop network of a chromatin fiber is , we compute the _ fraction disorganised _ , or @xmath7 . to define @xmath7",
    ", we count the number of steps ( upwards or downwards ) in the rosettogram . in an ideal string of @xmath83 rosettes",
    "there will be @xmath84 steps , so if @xmath83 denotes cluster number , we subtract @xmath84 from the number of steps : this gives the number of `` errors '' , i.e. , of non - local loops in the interaction network .",
    "the fraction disorganised is then defined as the number of errors per pixel ( i.e. , the number of errors divided by the number of pixels in the rosettogram ) . from this definition",
    ", it is apparent that a small value of @xmath7 indicates a structure akin to a regular string of rosettes , whereas a large value indicates a disordered structure with many non - local contacts .",
    "here , we explain how beads were colored using bioinformatic data in the chromosome simulations ( fig .",
    "4 , for chr12:85000000 - 100000000 bp , fig . s11 for chr6:5000000 - 20000000 bp , and fig . 5 for the whole of chr19 ) .",
    "beads in the simulations can interact either with ( black ) `` proteins '' binding to heterochromatin ( when they are colored grey ) or with ( red ) `` transcription factors '' binging to euchromatin ( when they are colored pink or light - green according to binding affinity ) , or with both ( indicated in cartoons by the surrounding halo ) , or with neither ( when they are colored blue ) .    data from the broad chromhmm track on the hg19 assembly of the ucsc genome browser were used to determine pink / light green coloring as follows : ( i ) if a region of 90 bp or more within one bead ( representing 1 kbp , figs 4 and s11 , or 3 kbp , fig .",
    "5 ) is labeled as an `` active promoter '' or `` strong enhancer '' ( states 1,4,5 on the broad chromhmm track ) , then the whole bead is colored pink ( so it binds with high affinity to red factors representing transcription factor / polymerase complexes ) ; ( ii ) if a region of 90 bp or more within the sequence covered by one bead is labeled `` transcriptional transition '' or `` transcriptional elongation '' ( states 9 and 10 ) , then that bead is colored light green ( and binds red factors with low affinity ) .    to determine whether a bead should be colored grey ( i.e. , labeled as heterochromatin ) we used one of the following two methods . either we directly used the broad chromhmm data ( in fig .",
    "s11 ) : if 90 bp or more within the bead is classified as state 13 , then the whole bead is classified as grey . alternatively ( in figs 4 , 5 and s11 )",
    "gc content data from the ucsc genome browser were used to color beads by setting a threshold gc content percentage and coloring beads grey if they fell below this . here",
    ", the rationale behind this is that heterochromatin and gene poor regions are known to correlate with low gc content ( they are rich in at ) .",
    "the threshold was set , in each case , so as to end up with the same overall number of heterochromatic beads as one would obtain if beads were colored grey according to the broad chromhmm track . as a result ,",
    "the % gc content threshold used was 43.4% for chr6 , 41.8% for chr12 and 48.4% for chr19 . for chr19",
    ", some of the telomeric sequences are missing for hg19 ; we have assumed these are not binding to black proteins .",
    "we note that our coloring scheme ( both when only using the hmm track and when also using gc content ) allows a bead to be of more than one color .",
    "this is sensible in view of our coarse graining ( a single bead can include both a euchromatic and a heterchromatic region ) , and also become some genomic regions can be targets for competing chromatin - associating proteins .    .some properties of rosettes found in different simulations ( @xmath18= 5 , except for the case in row 4 when @xmath18= 6 ) . in the table : ( i ) @xmath7= fraction disorganized ; ( ii ) number of pixels : number of pixels in rosettogram ; ( iii ) number of clusters : number of clusters in rosettogram ; ( iv ) alt.=alternating ( pink and light green beads ) ; ( v ) @xmath85= percentage of rows with contiguous pixels .
