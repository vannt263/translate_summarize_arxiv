    "online video repositories like youtube , dailymotion etc have been experiencing an explosion of user - generated videos .",
    "such videos are often shot / recorded from the television by users , and uploaded onto these sites .",
    "they have very little metadata like dialogue scripts , or a textual summary / representation of the content .",
    "when an user searches these repositories by keywords , ( s)he is suggested hundreds of videos , out of which ( s)he may choose a small number for viewing . this has given rise to the topic of _ video summarization _",
    "@xcite , which aims to provide the user a short but comprehensive _ summary _ of the video .",
    "however , the current state - of - the - art mostly provides a few keyframes as summary , which may not have much semantic significance .",
    "the high - level semantic information of videos that is most important to users is carried by _",
    "entities_- such as persons or other objects . with the recent progress in object detection  @xcite  @xcite in single images and videos , it is now possible to have a high - level representation of videos in terms of such entities .",
    "one effective way of summarization is to have a list of entities that appear frequently in a video .",
    "further , an user may want to watch only a part of a video , for example wherever a particular person ( or set of persons ) appears , which motivate the tasks of entity discovery and entity - driven summarization  @xcite of videos .",
    "the problem of _ automated discovery of persons from videos along with all their occurrences _ has attracted a lot of interest  @xcite@xcite@xcite in video analytics .",
    "existing attempts try to leverage meta - data such as scripts  @xcite@xcite and hence do not apply to videos available on the wild , such as tv - series episodes uploaded by viewers on youtube ( which have no such meta - data ) . in this paper",
    ", we pose this problem as _ tracklet clustering _",
    ", as done in  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to design algorithms for tracklet clustering which can work on long videos .",
    "tracklets@xcite are formed by detections of an entity ( say a person ) from a short contiguous sequence of 10 - 20 video frames .",
    "they have complex spatio - temporal properties .",
    "we should be able to handle any type of entity , not just person . given a video in the wild it is unlikely that the number of entities will be known , so the method should automatically adapt to unknown number of entities . to this end",
    "we advocate a _",
    "bayesian non - parametric _ clustering approach to tracklet clustering and study its effectiveness in automated discovery of entities with all their occurrences in long videos .",
    "the main challenges are in modeling the spatio - temporal properties . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this problem has not been studied either in machine learning or in computer vision community .    to explain the spatio - temporal properties we introduce some definitions .",
    "a _ track _ is formed by detecting entities ( like people s faces ) in each video frame , and associating detections across a contiguous sequence of frames ( typically a few hundreds in a tv series ) based on _ appearance _ and _ spatio - temporal _ locality .",
    "each track corresponds to a particular entity , like a person in a tv series .",
    "forming long tracks is often difficult , especially if there are multiple detections per frame .",
    "this can be solved hierarchically , by associating the detections in a short window of frames ( typically 10 - 20 ) to form _ tracklets _",
    "@xcite and then linking the tracklets from successive windows to form tracks .",
    "the _ short - range association of tracklets _ to form tracks is known as _",
    "tracking_. but in a tv series video , the same person may appear in different ( non - contiguous ) parts of the video , and so we need to associate tracklets on a _ long - range _ basis also ( see figure  [ fig : asso ] ) .",
    "moreover the task is complicated by lots of _ false detections _ which act as spoilers .",
    "finally , the task becomes more difficult on streaming videos , where only one pass is possible over the sequence .",
    "a major cue for this task comes from a very fundamental property of videos : _",
    "temporal coherence_(tc ) .",
    "this property manifests itself at detection - level as well as tracklet - level ; at feature - level as well as at semantic - level . at detection - level",
    "this property implies that the visual features of the detections ( eg . appearance of an entity ) are almost unchanged across a tracklet ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at tracklet - level",
    "it implies that _ spatio - temporally close ( but non - overlapping ) tracklets are likely to belong to the same entity _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] ) .",
    "additionally , _ overlapping tracklets ( that span the same frames ) , can not belong to the same entity_. a tracklet can be easily represented as all the associated detections are very similar ( due to detection - level tc ) .",
    "such representation is not easy for a long track where the appearances of the detections may gradually change .",
    "* contribution * broadly , this paper has two major contributions : it presents the first bayesian nonparametric models for tc in videos , and also the first entity - driven approach to video modelling . to these ends ,",
    "we explore tracklet clustering , an active area of research in computer vision , and advocate a bayesian non - parametric(bnp ) approach for it .",
    "we apply it to an important open problem : discovering entities ( like persons ) and all their occurrences from long videos , in absence of any meta - data , e.g. scripts .",
    "we use a simple and generic representation leading to representing a video by a matrix , whose columns represent individual tracklets ( unlike other works which represent an individual detection by a matrix column , and then try to encode the tracklet membership information ) .",
    "we propose temporally coherent - chinese restaurant process(tc - crp ) , a bnp prior for enforcing coherence on the tracklets .",
    "our method yields a superior clustering of tracklets over several baselines especially on long videos . as an advantage it does not need the number of clusters in advance .",
    "it is also able to automatically filter out false detections , and perform the same task on _ streaming videos _ , which are impossible for existing methods of tracklet clustering .",
    "we extend tc - crp to the temporally coherent chinese restaurant franchise ( tc - crf ) , that jointly models short video segments and further improves the results .",
    "we show that the proposed methods can be applied to entity - driven video summarization , by selecting a few representative segments of the video in terms of the discovered entities .",
    "in this section , we elaborate on our task of tracklet clustering for entity discovery in videos .      in this work , given a video , we fix beforehand the _ type of entity _",
    "( eg . person / face , cars , planes , trees ) we are interested in , and choose an appropriate detector like  @xcite  @xcite , which is run on every frame of the input video . the detections in successive frames are then linked based on spatial locality , to obtain tracklets . at most @xmath0 detections from @xmath0",
    "contiguous frames are linked like this .",
    "the tracklets of length less than @xmath0 are discarded , hence all tracklets consist of @xmath0 detections .",
    "we restrict the length of tracklets so that the appearance of the detections remain almost unchanged ( due to detection - level tc ) , which facilitates tracklet representation . at @xmath1",
    "we work with the individual detections .",
    "we represent a detection by a vector of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "this can be done by downscaling a rectangular detection to @xmath3 square and then reshaping it to a @xmath4-dimensional vector of pixel intensity values ( or some other features if deemed appropriate ) .",
    "each tracklet @xmath5 is a collection of @xmath0 detections @xmath6 .",
    "let the tracklet @xmath5 be represented by @xmath7 .",
    "so finally we have @xmath8 vectors ( @xmath8 : number of tracklets ) .    the tracklets can be sorted topologically based on their starting and ending frame indices .",
    "each tracklet @xmath5 has a _ predecessor tracklet _ @xmath9 and a _ successor tracklet _ @xmath10 .",
    "also each tracklet @xmath5 has a conflicting set of tracklets @xmath11 which span frame(s ) that overlap with the frames spanned by @xmath5 .",
    "each detection ( and tracklet ) is associated with an entity , which are unknown in number , but presumably much less than the number of detections ( and tracklets ) .",
    "these entities also are represented by vectors , say @xmath12 .",
    "each tracklet @xmath5 is associated with an entity indexed by @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "let each video be represented as a sequence of @xmath2-dimensional vectors @xmath15 along with the set @xmath16 .",
    "we aim to learn the vectors @xmath17 and the assignment variables @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we have _ constraints _ arising out of _ temporal coherence _ and other properties of videos .",
    "each tracklet @xmath5 is likely to be associated with the entity that its predecessor or successor is associated with , except at shot / scene changepoints .",
    "moreover , a tracklet @xmath5 can not share an entity with its conflicting tracklets @xmath11 , as the same entity can not occur twice in the same frame .",
    "this notion is considered in relevant literature  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the constraints are : @xmath19 _ learning a @xmath20-vector is equivalent to discovering an entity , and its associated tracklets are discovered by learning the set @xmath21 .",
    "_ these constraints give the task a flavour of non - parametric constrained clustering with must - link and dont - link constraints .    finally , the video frames can be grouped into short segments , based on the starting frame numbers @xmath22 of the @xmath8 tracklets .",
    "consider two successive tracklets @xmath5 and @xmath23 , with starting frames @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if the gap between frames @xmath24 and @xmath25 is larger than some threshold , then we consider a new temporal segment of the video starting from @xmath25 , and add @xmath26 to a list of _ changepoints _ ( cp ) .",
    "the beginning of a new temporal segment does not necessarily mean a scene change , the large gap between frames @xmath24 and @xmath25 may be caused by failure of detection or tracklet creation .",
    "the segment index of each tracklet @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "* person discovery in videos * is a task which has recently received attention in computer vision .",
    "cast listing  @xcite is aimed to choose a representative subset of the face detections or face tracks in a movie / tv series episode .",
    "another task is to label _ all the detections _ in a video , but this requires movie scripts  @xcite or labelled training videos having the same characters  @xcite .",
    "scene segmentation and person discovery are done simultaneously using a generative model in  @xcite , but once again with the help of scripts .",
    "an unsupervised version of this task is considered in  @xcite , which performs * face clustering * in presence of spatio - temporal constraints as already discussed . for this purpose",
    "they use a markov random field , and encode the constraints as clique potentials . another recent approach to face clustering",
    "is  @xcite which incorporates some spatio - temporal constraints into subspace clustering .",
    "* tracklet association * _ tracking _ is a core topic in computer vision , in which a target object is located in each frame based on appearance similarity and spatio- temporal locality .",
    "a more advanced task is _ multi - target tracking _",
    "@xcite , in which several targets are present per frame .",
    "a tracking paradigm that is particularly helpful in multi - target tracking is _ tracking by detection _",
    "@xcite , where object - specific detectors like  @xcite are run per frame ( or on a subset of frames ) , and the detection responses are linked to form tracks . from this came the concept of _ tracklet _  @xcite which attempts to do the linking hierarchically .",
    "this requires pairwise similarity measures between tracklets .",
    "multi - target tracking via tracklets is usually cast as bipartite matching , which is solved using hungarian algorithm .",
    "tracklet association and face clustering are done simultaneously in  @xcite using hmrf .",
    "the main difference of face / tracklet clustering and person discovery is that , the number of clusters to be formed is not known in the latter .",
    "independent of videos , * constrained clustering * is itself a field of research .",
    "constraints are usually _ must - link and dont - link _ , which specify pairs which should be assigned the same cluster , or must not be assigned the same cluster .",
    "a detailed survey is found in  @xcite .",
    "the constraints can be hard  @xcite or soft / probabilistic  @xcite .",
    "constrained spectral clustering has also been studied recently  @xcite  @xcite , which allow constrained clustering of datapoints based on arbitrary similarity measures .",
    "all the above methods suffer from a major defect- the number of clusters needs to be known beforehand . a way to avoid this is provided by * dirichlet process * , which is able to identify the number of clusters from the data .",
    "it is a mixture model with infinite number of mixture components , and each datapoint is assigned to one component .",
    "a limitation of dp is that it is exchangeable , and can not capture sequential structure in the data . for this purpose ,",
    "a markovian variation was proposed : hierarchical dirichlet process- hidden markov model ( hdp - hmm ) .",
    "a variant of this is the _ sticky _ hdp - hmm ( shdp - hmm )  @xcite , which was proposed for temporal coherence in speech data for the task of speaker diarization , based on the observation that successive datapoints are likely to be from the same speaker and so should be assigned to the same component .",
    "another bayesian nonparametric approach for sequential data is the distance - dependent chinese restaurant process ( ddcrp )  @xcite , which defines distances between every pair of datapoints , and each point is linked to another with probability proportional to such distances .",
    "a bnp model for subset selection is indian buffet process ( ibp )  @xcite , a generative process for a sequence of binary vectors .",
    "this has been used for selecting a sparse subset of mixture components ( topics ) in focussed topic modelling  @xcite as the compound dirichlet mixture model .",
    "finally , * video summarization * has been studied for a few years in the computer vision community .",
    "the aim is to provide a short but comprehensive summary of videos .",
    "this summary is usually in the form of a few _ keyframes _ , and sometimes as a short segment of the video around these keyframes .",
    "a recent example is  @xcite which models a video as a matrix , each frame as a column , and each keyframe as a _ basis vector _ , in terms of which the other columns are expressed .",
    "a more recent work  @xcite considers a kernel matrix to encode similarities between pairs of frames , uses it for _ temporal segmentation _ of the video , assigns an importance label to each of these segments using an svm ( trained from segmented and labelled videos ) , and creates the summary with the important segments",
    ". however , such summaries are in terms of low - level visual features , rather than high - level semantic features which humans use . an attempt to bridge this gap",
    "was made in  @xcite , which defined movie scenes and summaries in terms of characters .",
    "this work used face detections along with _ movie scripts _ for semantic segmentation into shots and scenes , which were used for summarization .",
    "we now explain our bayesian nonparametric model tc - crp to handle the spatio - temporal constraints ( eq  [ eq : cons ] ) for tracklet clustering , and describe a generative process for videos based on tracklets .      in section  [ sec : def ] , we discussed the vectors @xmath28 each of which represent an entity . in this paper",
    "we consider a bayesian approach with gaussian mixture components @xmath29 to account for the variations in visual features of the detections , say face detections of a person .",
    "as already mentioned , number of components @xmath30 is not known beforehand , and must be discovered from the data .",
    "that is why we consider nonparametric bayesian modelling .",
    "also , as we shall see , this route allows us to elegantly model the temporal coherence constraints . in this approach , we shall represent entities as mixture components and tracklets as draws from such mixture components .    dirichlet process  @xcite has become an important clustering tool in recent years .",
    "its greatest strength is that unlike k - means , it is able to discover the correct number of clusters . dirichlet process is a distribution over distributions over a measurable space .",
    "a discrete distribution @xmath31 is said to be distributed as @xmath32 over space @xmath33 if for every finite partition of @xmath33 as @xmath34 , the quantity @xmath35 is distributed as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a scalar called _ concentration parameter _ , and @xmath38 is a distribution over @xmath33 called base distribution .",
    "a distribution @xmath39 is a discrete distribution , with infinite support set @xmath40 , which are draws from @xmath38 , called _",
    "we consider @xmath38 to be a @xmath41 multivariate gaussian with parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "each atom corresponds to an entity ( eg . a person ) .",

    "@xmath47 is a tracklet representation corresponding to the entity , and its slight variation from @xmath46 ( due to effects like lighting and pose variation ) is modelled using @xmath48 .    using the constructive definition of dirichlet process , called the stick - breaking process  @xcite",
    ", the above process can also be written equivalently as    @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath50 is a distribution over integers , and @xmath13 is an integer that indexes the component corresponding to the tracklet @xmath5 .",
    "our aim is to discover the values @xmath20 , which will give us the entities , and also to find the values @xmath51 , which define a clustering of the tracklets . for this purpose",
    "we use collapsed gibbs sampling , where we integrate out the @xmath31 in equation  [ eq : dp1 ] or @xmath52 in equation  [ eq : dp2 ] .",
    "the gibbs sampling equations @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given in  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath55    here , @xmath56 is the data likelihood term .",
    "we focus on the part @xmath57 to model tc .      in the generative process ( equation  [ eq : dp2 ] )",
    "all the @xmath13 are drawn iid conditioned on @xmath50 .",
    "such models are called _",
    "completely exchangeable_. this is , however , often not a good idea for sequential data such as videos . in markovian models like sticky hdp - hmm",
    ", @xmath13 is drawn conditioned on @xmath50 and @xmath58 . in case of dp , the independence among @xmath13-s",
    "is lost on integrating out @xmath50 .",
    "after integration the generative process of eq  [ eq : dp2 ] can be redefined as    @xmath59    the predictive distribution for @xmath60 for dirichlet process is known as chinese restaurant process ( crp ) .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the number of times the value @xmath63 is taken in the set @xmath64 .",
    "we now modify crp to handle the spatio - temporal cues ( eq  [ eq : cons ] ) mentioned in the previous section . in the generative process , we define @xmath65 with respect to @xmath9 , similar to the block exchangeable mixture model as defined in  @xcite . here , with each @xmath13 we associate a _ binary change variable _ @xmath66 . if @xmath67 then @xmath68 , i.e the tracklet identity is maintained .",
    "but if @xmath69 , a new value of @xmath13 is sampled . note that every tracklet @xmath5 has a temporal predecessor @xmath9 . however , if this predecessor is spatio - temporally close , then it is more likely to have the same label .",
    "so , the probability distribution of change variable @xmath66 should depend on this closeness . in tc - crp ,",
    "we use two values ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) for the bernoulli parameter for the change variables .",
    "we put a threshold on the spatio - temporal distance between @xmath5 and @xmath9 , and choose a bernoulli parameter for @xmath66 based on whether this threshold is exceeded or not .",
    "note that maintaining tracklet identity by setting @xmath67 is equivalent to _",
    "tracking_.    several datapoints ( tracklets ) arise due to false detections .",
    "we need a way to model these .",
    "since these are very different from the base mean @xmath42 , we consider a separate component @xmath72 with mean @xmath42 and a very large covariance @xmath73 , which can account for such variations .",
    "the predictive probability function(ppf ) for tc - crp is defined as follows :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the set of values of @xmath76 for the set of tracklets @xmath11 that overlap with @xmath5 , and @xmath77 is the number of points @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the first rule ensures that two overlapping tracklets can not have same value of @xmath76 .",
    "the second rule accounts for false tracklets .",
    "the third and fourth rules define a crp restricted to the changepoints where @xmath81 .",
    "the final tracklet generative process is as follows :    @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 draw @xmath86 @xmath68 @xmath87 @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the ppf for tc - crp , defined in eq  [ eq : ppf1 ] .",
    "inference in tc - crp can be performed easily through gibbs sampling .",
    "we need to infer @xmath66 , @xmath13 and @xmath20 . as @xmath66 and @xmath13",
    "are coupled , we sample them in a block for each @xmath90 $ ] as done in  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath91 and @xmath92 , then we must have @xmath93 and @xmath94 . if @xmath91 and @xmath95 , then @xmath94 , and @xmath96 is sampled from @xmath97 . in case @xmath98 and @xmath92 , then @xmath99 with probability proportional to @xmath100 . if @xmath101 then @xmath102 if @xmath103 , and @xmath104 otherwise .",
    "if @xmath105 then @xmath106 is governed by tc - crp . for sampling @xmath20 , we make use of the conjugate prior formula of gaussians , to obtain the gaussian posterior with mean @xmath107 where @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "finally , we update the hyperparameters @xmath42 and @xmath110 after every iteration , based on the learned values of @xmath40 , using maximum likelihood estimate .",
    "@xmath70,@xmath71 can also be updated , but in our implementation we set them to @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively , based on empirical evaluation on one held - out video .",
    "the threshold @xmath113 was also similarly fixed .",
    "in the previous section , we considered the entire video as a single block , as the tccrp ppf for any tracklet @xmath5 involves @xmath114-values from all the previously seen tracklets throughout the video .",
    "however , this need not be very accurate , as in a particular part of the video some mixture components ( entities ) may be more common than anywhere else , and for any @xmath5 , @xmath13 may depend more heavily on the @xmath76-values in temporally close tracklets than the ones far away .",
    "this is because , a tv - series video consists of _ temporal segments _ like scenes and shots , each characterized by a subset of persons ( encoded by binary vector @xmath115 ) .",
    "the tracklets attached to a segment @xmath116 can not be associated with persons not listed by @xmath117 . to capture this notion we propose a new model : temporally coherent chinese restaurant franchise ( tc - crf ) to model a video temporally segmented by @xmath118 ( see section  [ sec : def ] ) .",
    "chinese restaurant process is the ppf associated with dirichlet process .",
    "hierarchical dirichlet process ( hdp )  @xcite aimed at modelling _ grouped data sharing same mixture components_. it assumes a group - specific distribution @xmath119 for every group @xmath116 .",

    "the ppf corresponding to this process is obtained by marginalizing the distributions @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and is called the _ chinese restaurant franchise _ process , elaborated in  @xcite . in our case , we can modify this ppf once again to incorporate tc , analogously to tc - crp , to have temporally coherent chinese restaurant franchise ( tc - crf ) process . in our case",
    ", a group corresponds to a temporal segment , and as already mentioned , we want a binary vector @xmath117 , which indicates the components that are active in segment @xmath116 .",
    "but hdp assumes that all the components are shared by all the groups , i.e. any particular component can be sampled in any of the groups .",
    "we can instead try _ sparse modelling _ by incorporating @xmath123 into the model , as done in  @xcite for focussed topic models . for this purpose",
    "we put an ibp  @xcite prior on the @xmath123 variables , where @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the number of times component @xmath63 has been sampled in all scenes before @xmath116 , and @xmath126 .",

    "finally , a completely new component may be sampled with probability proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath140 .",
    "tc - crp draws inspirations from several recently proposed bayesian nonparametric models , but is different from each of them .",
    "it has three main characterestics : 1 ) changepoint - variables @xmath134 2 ) temporal coherence and spatio - temporal cues 3 ) separate component for non - face tracklets .",
    "the concept of changepoint variable was used in block - exchangeable mixture model  @xcite , which showed that this significantly speeds up the inference .",
    "but in bemm , the bernoulli parameter of changepoint variable @xmath66 depends on @xmath141 while in tc - crp it depends on @xmath142 . regarding spatio - temporal cues ,",
    "the concept of providing additional weightage to self - transition was introduced in sticky hdp - hmm  @xcite , but this model does not consider change - point variables .",
    "moreover , it uses a transition distribution @xmath143 for each mixture component @xmath63 , which increases the model complexity . like bemm  @xcite we avoid this step , and",
    "hence our ppf ( eq  [ eq : ppf1 ] ) does not involve @xmath141 .",
    "ddcrp  @xcite defines distances between every pair of datapoints , and associates a new datapoint @xmath5 with one of the previous ones ( @xmath144 ) based on this distance .",
    "here we consider distances between a point @xmath5 and its predecessor @xmath9 only . on the other hand ,",
    "ddcrp is unrelated to the original dp - based crp , as its ppf does not consider @xmath145 : the number of previous datapoints assigned to component @xmath63 .",
    "hence our method is significantly different from ddcrp .",
    "finally , the first two rules of tc - crp ppf are novel .",
    "tc - crf is inspired by hdp  @xcite .",
    "however , once again there are three differences mentioned above hold good . in addition , the ppf of tc - crf itself is different from chinese restaurant franchise as described in  @xcite .",
    "the original crf is defined in terms of two concepts : tables and dishes , where tables are local to individual restaurants ( data groups ) while dishes ( mixture components ) are global , shared across restaurants ( groups ) .",
    "also individual datapoints are assigned mixture components indirectly , through an intermediate assignment of tables .",
    "the concept of table , which comes due to marginalization of group - specific mixture distributions , results in complex book - keeping , and the ppf for datapoints is difficult to define .",
    "here we avoid this problem , by skipping tables and directly assigning mixture components to datapoints in eq  [ eq : ppf3 ] .",
    "inspiration of tc - crf is also drawn from ibp - compound dirichlet process  @xcite .",
    "but the inference process of  @xcite is complex , since the convolution of the dp - distributed mixture distribution and the sparse binary vector is difficult to marginalize by integration .",
    "we avoid this step by directly defining the ppf ( eq  [ eq : ppf3 ] ) instead of taking the dp route .",
    "this approach of directly defining the ppf was taken for dd - crp  @xcite also .",
    "one particular entity discovery task that has recently received a lot of attention is person discovery from movies/ tv series .",
    "we carried out extensive experiments for person discovery on tv series videos of various lengths .",
    "we collected three episodes of the big bang theory ( season 1 ) .",
    "each episode is 20 - 22 minutes long , and has 7 - 8 characters ( occurring in at least 100 frames ) .",
    "we also collected 6 episodes of the famous indian tv series `` the mahabharata '' from youtube .",
    "each episode of this series is 40 - 45 minutes long , and have 15 - 25 prominent characters .",
    "so here , each character is an entity .",
    "these videos are much longer than those studied in similar works like  @xcite , and have more characters .",
    "also , these videos are challenging because of the somewhat low quality and motion blur .",
    "transcripts or labeled training sets are unavailable for all these videos . as usual in the literature  @xcite@xcite , we represent the persons with their faces .",
    "we obtained face detections by running the opencv face detector on each frame separately .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : def ] the face detections were all converted to grayscale , scaled down to @xmath146 , and reshaped to form @xmath147-dimensional vectors .",
    "we considered tracklets of size @xmath148 and discarded smaller ones .",
    "the dataset details are given in table 1 .",

    "in this paper , we considered an entity - driven approach to video modelling .",
    "we represented videos as sequences of tracklets , with each tracklet associated with an entity .",
    "we defined entity discovery as the task of discovering the repeatedly appearing entities in the videos , along with all their appearances , and cast this as tracklet clustering .",
    "we considered a bayesian nonparametric approach to tracklet clustering which can automatically discover the number of clusters to be formed .",
    "we leveraged the temporal coherence property of videos to improve the clustering by our first model : tc - crp .",
    "the second model tc - crf was a natural extension to tc - crp , to jointly model short temporal segments within a video , and further improve entity discovery .",
    "these methods were empirically shown to have several additional abilities like performing online entity discovery efficiently , and detecting false tracklets .",
    "finally , we used these results for semantic video summarization in terms of the discovered entities ."
