    "as it is , the effective entanglement verification answers only partially the important question of how much secret key can alice and bob obtain from their correlated data : it just tells if the secret key rate @xmath18 is zero or it may be positive .",

    "_ in ref .",
    "these authors showed that the value of @xmath18 that can be extracted from a quantum state @xmath2 can be strictly greater than the distillable entanglement @xcite , and it is generally bounded from above by the regularized relative entropy of entanglement @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "v concludes the paper with a summary .",
    "the secret key rate @xmath18 , i.e. , the rate of secret key that can be obtained per signal state sent by alice to bob , is one of the most important figures of merit in order to compare the performance of different qkd schemes .",
    "ideally , one would like to calculate the maximum achievable value of @xmath18 from the data available once the first phase of the qkd protocol is completed .",
    "note that the second phase is just a classical procedure that is completely independent of the actual experimental setup used .    in a similar spirit ,",
    "any upper bound on the achievable secret key rate @xmath18 should as well be valid for any arbitrary public communication protocol performed during the second phase of qkd .",
    "the upper bound only depends on the observed data @xmath1 together with the particular povms @xmath20 and @xmath21 used by alice and bob .",
    "this gives rise to one main requirement expected from any upper bound on @xmath18 : if the observed data @xmath1 can originate from a separable state , then any upper bound must vanish @xcite .",
    "that is , the upper bound might be considered as the generalization of the necessary effective entanglement verification .    from a practical point of view",
    ", it would be necessary that any upper bound on @xmath18 includes the effect of imperfect devices .",
    "especially , it should be able to take into account the low detection efficiency and the noise in the form of dark counts introduced by current detection devices .",
    "this fact is of special importance in order to compare different realizations of qkd , and it can be used to see the tradeoff between desired and realizable implementations of qkd .      in this section , we review very briefly some known upper bounds on @xmath18 that apply to particular scenarios :    _ mutual information @xmath22 : _ suppose alice and bob are connected by a public channel and have access to repeated independent realizations of two random variables , denoted as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and which are characterized by a joint probability distribution @xmath25 .",

    "this upper bound can directly be used for the case of qkd , just by taking as @xmath25 the correlated data @xmath1 . moreover , in this case , one can easily incorporate the effect of the imperfections in the detectors when calculating @xmath22 .",

    "however , recently it has been proven that the secret key rate can be smaller than the intrinsic information @xcite .    more important for qkd , the upper bound based on the intrinsic information can be adapted to the case where alice , bob , and eve start sharing a tripartite quantum state instead of a joint probability distribution . for this purpose",
    ", one can consider all possible tripartite states that eve can establish using her eavesdropping method , and all possible measurements she could perform on her subsystem .",
