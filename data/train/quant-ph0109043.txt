    "when mirrors are closely placed , the attractive or repulsive force between them is observed .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the casimir effect  @xcite , is explained by the fact that the vacuum state of the electromagnetic ( em ) field in the presence of the mirrors is modified from that of the free space , and the vacuum fluctuation energy depends on the positions of the mirrors . on the other hand ,",
    "when the mirrors move very rapidly , quantum state of the em field can not adiabatically follow the instantaneous vacuum state for each position of the mirrors , resulting in the creation of photons .",
    "such excitation of the quantum field caused by non - adiabatic change of the vacuum state  @xcite is referred to as the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) , and there have been numerous investigations into this subject  @xcite , e.g. , spectral properties of created photons  @xcite , radiation pressure on a moving mirror  @xcite , squeezing in the radiation field  @xcite , effective hamiltonian approach  @xcite , time - varying refractive index  @xcite , radiation from moving dielectrics  @xcite , influence of finite temperature  @xcite , and relation with sonoluminescence  @xcite .    in the most of the previous works ,",
    "the moving mirrors have been treated as the moving boundary conditions such that the transverse components of the electric field operator vanish at the mirror surfaces in their rest frames .",
    "such external boundary conditions , of course , violate the commutation relation of the em field operators at the boundaries , and the incarceration of the photon field between the moving mirrors causes the temporal change of the hilbert space .",
    "thus , the ` classical ' external boundary conditions involve quantum mechanical imperfections . to circumvent these conceptual difficulties , the various results of the moving - mirror problem based on the boundary conditions",
    "should be examined and derived as some limiting case of more elaborate models .",
    "several studies have been done towards this direction by considering moving matter with finite refractive index  @xcite : formulation of the problem and radiation spectrum  @xcite , radiative reaction on the mirror  @xcite , the dispersive mirror  @xcite , radiation in two and three dimension  @xcite , and density variation in dielectrics  @xcite .",
    "recently , koashi and ueda  @xcite formulated the static casimir effect based on a combined system of the em and matter fields , and showed that the both fields participate in the vacuum fluctuations inducing the casimir force .",
    "although the quantum theory of the systems in which the em field and matter interact with each other has been developed by many authors  @xcite , such an approach to the dce has hardly been made so far  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to formulate the dce in a moving - matter system in terms of the quantized field - matter theory .",
    "the em field attenuates by coupling with the matter field inside the mirrors , and therefore no external boundary conditions are required . in other words , the em field confined in the resonator",
    "is dressed by the matter field inside the mirrors , forming cavity polaritons .",
    "non - adiabatic movement of the mirrors excites the cavity polaritons and this phenomenon may be called the dce of polaritons . in this paper , we derive the effective hamiltonian for polaritons , apply it to the moving - mirror problem , and compare the result with that based on the external boundary conditions  @xcite .",

    "[ s : heff ] , we derive the effective hamiltonian for polaritons in the moving - mirror system , and apply it to the one - dimensional case . final section presents the summary of this paper , and some complicated algebraic manipulations are relegated to appendices .",
    "we briefly review the moving - mirror problem  @xcite to make the present paper self - contained and to fix the notation .",
    "the simplest system consists of two perfectly reflecting mirror plates placed in parallel as illustrated in fig .  [ f : mirror ] .    , and the right mirror moves along the @xmath0 axis . , width=325 ]",
    "the mirror at the origin @xmath1 is fixed and the other at the position @xmath2 is allowed to move .",
    "the system is assumed to be uniform in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , and we consider only one component of the vector potential , say the @xmath3 component @xmath5 , without loss of generality .",
    "the vector potential in the coulomb gauge obeys the wave equation as ( we omit the subscript @xmath3 of @xmath6 from now on ) @xmath7 and the boundary conditions are imposed as @xmath8 , which guarantee that the transverse components of the electric field vanish at the surfaces of the mirrors in their rest frames .",
    "the field operator of the vector potential @xmath9 in the heisenberg representation can be expanded as @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the annihilation and creation operators of photons of the @xmath13th mode .",
    "one approach  @xcite to this problem is to fix @xmath11 and @xmath14 to ones at @xmath15 , and evolve the function @xmath16 as @xmath17 with the boundary conditions @xmath18 which ensure that @xmath9 obeys the wave equation ( [ waveeq ] ) and the boundary conditions @xmath19 . when @xmath20 is constant , the function @xmath16 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "when the characteristic time of the mirror motion is much larger than @xmath24 , @xmath16 adiabatically follows the mode function for each @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "when the mirror moves much faster , the adiabatic theorem breaks down , and @xmath16 evolves in a more complicated manner .",
    "the time evolution of the system in this approach is thus not generated by a predetermined hamiltonian but by the classical equation of motion ( [ waveeq2 ] ) and the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) , by which the time evolution of @xmath9 in the heisenberg representation is obtained .",
    "another approach to the moving - mirror problem is the method of an effective hamiltonian  @xcite , where the function @xmath29 is fixed to the mode function for each @xmath25 as @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are time dependent .",
    "this time evolution is described by the heisenberg equation as @xmath33,\\ ] ] where the effective hamiltonian for an operator @xmath34 is denoted by @xmath35 . in the one - dimensional moving - mirror problem ,",

    "another advantage of the effective hamiltonian approach is that we can understand easily what kinds of elementary processes occur .",
    "for example , the second term of the effective hamiltonian ( [ hefflaw ] ) has the form of the parametric process , suggesting that the squeezed state is produced when the mirror oscillates at frequency @xmath41 .",
    "the third term induces pair creation and annihilation of photons and energy transfer between different modes .    in the above approaches ,",
    "the boundary conditions that the filed operator @xmath9 vanishes at @xmath1 and @xmath42 are imposed .",
    "because of these boundary conditions , the canonical commutation relation @xmath43 = -i \\hbar / \\varepsilon_0 \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\delta$}_t({\\bf r } - { \\bf r}')$ ] does not hold at the boundaries , where @xmath44 is the transverse delta function .",
    "the field operator ( [ ax ] ) and the hilbert space on which it operates are defined only within the interval @xmath40 , and then the hilbert space varies accordingly .",
    "we start from a classical microscopic model , in which polarizable atoms in the matter interact with the em field .",
    "we suppose that the @xmath45th atom consists of an electron with charge @xmath46 and mass @xmath47 at the position @xmath48 and an ion with charge @xmath49 and mass @xmath50 at the position @xmath51 . the relative vector between the electron and the ion is denoted by @xmath52 , and the center - of - mass vector is @xmath53 .",
    "we assume that the center - of - mass vectors @xmath54 are given functions of time when the matter is moved .",
