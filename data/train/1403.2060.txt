    "this article describes the impact that the incompleteness of the market for credit default swaps ( cdss ) has on their modelling , hedging , and valuation . while the general properties of contingent claims in incomplete markets have been extensively discussed in the academic literature ( e.g. see the review @xcite ) , discussions in both the applied and academic literature that take appropriate account of the incompleteness of the cds markets are rare , if , indeed , they exist . a recent article discussing illiquid cdss @xcite is an exception .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to continue the exploration of issues , begun in the previous article , related to the contributions that incomplete - market methods can make to improving our understanding of illiquid cdss and their associated risks . also , not only are single cdss discussed , but the class of problems considered is extended to include single - name cds portfolios .",
    "short - comings of the market - standard approach @xcite are discussed in some detail , and the presentation of the incomplete - market model describes how it changes our view of the properties of credit default swaps .",
    "for example , subsection [ notmarketable ] defines marketability , shows that illiquid cdss are not marketable , and states that , as a consequence , illiquid cdss ( which are valued in market - standard practice by using the risk - neutral valuation principle ) can not in fact be valued correctly by using the risk - neutral valuation principle because they are not marketable .",
    "other related items can be found in the same subsection , and more details are given in the summary and conclusions , section [ summary ] .",
    "the background material necessary for treating these subjects is not new , but can be found in the academic literature and in reviews and textbooks treating the subject of incomplete markets ( e.g. see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "what is new is that the ideas presented below are presented in the context of applying them to a practical model for hedging credit default swaps .",
    "numerical examples exploring a number of different properties of illiquid single cdss and of illiquid single - name cds portfolios ( portfolios that reference only a single name ) are an important part of this article .",
    "the first of these numerical examples , discussed in subsubsection [ vanillahedge ] , describes the fact that , as a result of market incompleteness , there is no unique price for an illiquid cds , for the simple reason that there is no replicating portfolio to enforce this price by creating arbitrage opportunities in cases where the illiquid cds is made available at the ` wrong ' price . on the other hand",
    ", there is a range of fair prices available to each illiquid maturity .",
    "( a fair price is a price that allows neither the buyer nor the seller to acquire an arbitrage profit . )",
    "subsubsection [ vanillahedge ] introduces a hedge that is called the vanilla hedge .",
    "the vanilla hedge is an approximation to the optimal hedge that was described in detail in @xcite and is a part of the effort of this article to make the results of incomplete - market ideas accessible to those with little exposure to incomplete - market methods .",
    "it has the attractive feature that it allows one to determine the no - arbitrage bounds on the prices of illiquid cdss by elementary methods , and to arrive at analytic formulae for these bounds .",
    "this enables one to obtain an intuitive understanding of the construction of the no - arbitrage bounds and of the behavior of these bounds as a function of the illiquid cds maturity .",
    "a figure showing the richness of detail in the behavior of these no - arbitrage bounds accompanies the explanation .",
    "since subsubsection [ vanillahedge ] is intended to be more or less self - contained , the reader may wish to try jumping ahead to it before continuing .",
    "the selection of a price within the no - arbitrage bounds is , unfortunately , beyond the capabilities of risk - neutral pricing , and involves assessing the risks and the likelihood of profits .",
    "the marking to market of an illiquid cds is therefore a combined modelling and risk - management problem .    see section [ market ] for details on the nature of the incompleteness of cds markets .",
    "section [ sncdsport ] develops the basic equations used in the incomplete - market approach to the hedging and valuation of single - name cds portfolios .",
    "most of section [ market ] and parts of section [ sncdsport ] were described in @xcite , but some of this material is included here at a faster pace to make the present article more self - contained .",
    "section [ numerical ] describes several numerical calculations , and gives figures , that illustrate the use of the results obtained in [ sncdsport ] .",
    "sections [ sncdsport ] and [ numerical ] have their own introductions .",
    "sources from which the author has profited particularly are the detailed and thorough review of incomplete markets in @xcite , the elementary introduction to risk - neutral pricing of @xcite , the presentations of @xcite]of lessons learned from the 2007 - 2009 credit crisis , and the appropriateness of a focus on a combined modelling and risk management approach to valuation .",
    "other useful references can be found in @xcite , as can details that will be of interest to those wishing to develop a numerical implementation , as well as to those wishing to examine results coming from the application of duality theory .",
    "standard cds contracts are currently priced by setting the magnitude of the upfront payment paid by the protection buyer to the protection seller @xcite .",
    "in addition to paying the upfront price the protection buyer makes quarterly payments of a standardized spread ( in the north american market this is 100 bp / yr for investment grade names and 500 bp / yr for high yield names ) and in return receives the loss of notional on default of a corporate bond issued by the underlying reference name .",
    "the standard termination dates , as well as the standard premium payment dates , for cdss are the imm dates march 20 , june 20 , september 20 , and december 20 . contracts having termination dates at the end of a quarter , say june 20 , some integral number of years in the future , will be sold on the market during the quarter leading up to june 20 .",
    "during this quarter there will be no liquidity in contracts having one of the other three standard termination dates .",
    "on june 20 there will be a roll when the selling of contracts with a termination date of june 20 will cease , and the selling of contracts having a september 20 termination date will begin .",
    "furthermore , the number years for which there is liquidity will depend on the name .",
    "for example there may be liquidity only in contracts terminating 1,3,5 7 and 10 years in the future .",
    "thus , at any given time , there will be liquidity in relatively few of the existing contracts , and it will not be possible to perfectly hedge an arbitrary portfolio of existing cds contracts of a given reference name .",
    "this section develops the basic formulae used in the static hedging of single - name cds portfolios .",
    "counterparty risk is assumed to have been taken care of by water - tight collateral arrangements .",
    "the starting portfolio can be made up of both illiquid and liquid cdss of arbitrary but given notionals . at the initial time",
    ", the starting portfolio will be hedged using liquid cdss from the market .",
    "the hedge is a static one and the value of the resulting payoff stream will be followed in time . for simplicity , only the case where the spreads for all maturities are the same ( typically the case for post - big - bang cds contracts ) will be treated explicitly in this article .",
    "the extension to the case of multiple spreads for each different maturity can be treated by a notational change ( see below ) .",
    "the results developed in this section represent an extension of those in @xcite from the case of single cdss to single - name cds portfolios , but the pace of the presentation is more rapid .",
    "furthermore , details of how to approach various technical problems , such as the method of efficiently discretising the continuous paths @xmath1 so as to turn the optimization problem of ( [ optimization ] ) into a linear programming problem that can be solved using commercially available software , are given in @xcite .",
    "subsection [ notation ] gives some preliminary definitions and results .",
    "subsection [ notmarketable ] shows that illiquid cdss are not marketable .",
    "this result shows that the market - standard use of the risk - neutral valuation principle to value illiquid cdss has no foundation in mathematical finance theory : the use of the risk - neutral valuation principle to value a contingent claim can be justified only in cases where the claim to be valued is marketable .",
    "subsection [ nab ] develops the main results of this section .",
    "these results allow the identification of the range of portfolio prices that are arbitrage - free and those that offer the opportunity for arbitrage profits .",
    "they also show how to construct a hedged position that reduces the risk of holding an illiquid cds portfolio .      the present time is called @xmath2 .",
    "for this article , the quarterly cds premiun payment times occurring after @xmath2 , are , beginning with the smallest , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , so a contract concluded in the quarter preceeding @xmath5 will have a nominal 5-yr maturity at @xmath6 .",
    "also , define @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath8 is time @xmath2 ) .",
    "the time difference @xmath9 can be less than a quarter of a year , but subsequent time intervals are exactly a quarter of a year .",

    "it is also straight - forward to consider the case in which contracts occur that differ from one another in having a number different spreads for each termination date : this is done by including an index @xmath30 that labels the different spreads that occur for termination date @xmath31 , as in @xmath32 .",
    "it is assumed that there is a liquid market for a small number @xmath33 of the @xmath34 different cds contracts .",
    "the p - th liquid contract corresponds to termination time @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "consider a cds contract with a termination time @xmath37 that is not equal to any of the termination times @xmath35 of the @xmath33 contracts forming the liquid cds market .",
    "such a contract is said to be illiquid .",
    "( note that the use of illiquid here refers to all maturities that are not explicitly listed as being on the cds market .",
    "this can include cdss that are identified as marketable or not marketable below . ) a contingent claim x is said to be marketable if a linear combination of the payoff streams of the @xmath33 contracts on the liquid market can be constructed in such a way that this combination of payoff streams of replicates the payoff stream of the claim @xmath38 . otherwise the contingent claim is not marketable .",
    "the payoff stream of a cds contract with maturity @xmath16 is given by ( [ udef ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the illiquid cds contract with termination time @xmath37 is not marketable .",
    "the discontinuity in @xmath13 when @xmath12 crosses the value @xmath39 can not be replicated by the discontinuity in @xmath13 of any cds contract on the market .",
    "( note that the mathematical expression for the payoff stream for the illiquid contract with maturity @xmath39 that is given in ( [ udef ] ) contains the discontinuous function @xmath40 .",
    "it is clear that no linear combination of cds payoff streams from the liquid market , which have their discontinuities at other maturities , can reproduce the discontinuity from @xmath41 .",
    "another way to say this is to say that one can not form a replicating portfolio for an illiquid cds contract . in the same way",
    ", it follows that it is not possible to form a replicating portfolio for any single - name cds portfolio that contains at least one illiquid cds ; such a portfolio is said to be not marketable",
    ".    there can be both marketable contracts and contracts that are not marketable in incomplete markets .",
    "if a contract is marketable , there is a replicating portfolio corresponding to this contract .",
    "the holder of a marketable contract will be able to short the replicating contract on the market in return for the total market price , say @xmath42 , of the cdss making up the replicating portfolio .",
    "the contract holder will then be able to combine the marketable contract and the short replicating contract , the combination of the two having no net payoffs , and hence zero value .",
    "the net result of this will leave the marketable contract holder with the cash amount of @xmath42 , which is the unique value of the marketable contract .",
    "if a contract is not marketable , then by definition there is no replicating portfolio and there is no way to establish a unique , preference - free value for a contract that is not marketable .",
    "however , it is possible to determine an arbitrage - free range of values , any one of which would be considered to be a fair price for the contract .",
    "the boundary points of the arbitrage - free range of values are called the no - arbitrage bounds .",
    "the market - standard model for cdss ] has , by construction , a risk - neutral measure @xmath43 , characterized by having exactly the same number of parameters as there are cdss ( and hence cds prices ) on the market .",
    "also , the recovery rate is taken to be a given constant .",
    "calibration to the market prices then uniquely determines the risk - neutral measure @xmath43 .",
    "once the unique risk - neutral measure has been determined by calibration , the market - standard practice is to calculate , for an illiquid cds of maturity @xmath37 and unit notional , a unique mark - to - market price @xmath44 by using @xmath45 where the right hand side of this equation is the expected value , under the unique market - standard risk - neutral measure @xmath43 , of the discounted future payoffs for @xmath46 , given by ( [ udef ] ) .",
    "the valuation principle of risk - neutral pricing theory is that , given a risk - neutral probability measure @xmath43 , and a marketable contingent claim @xmath38 , the time @xmath2 value of @xmath38 is given by the expression @xmath47 .",
    "an important condition here is that in order to make correct use of this risk - neutral valuation principle , the contingent claim to be valued in this way must be marketable .",
    "thus , it is a misapplication of risk - neutral pricing to use ( [ mtmq ] ) to value an illiquid cds since , as shown above , illiquid cdss are not marketable .",
    "there is thus no sound basis for the interpretation of ( [ mtmq ] ) as a mark - to - market value .",
    "( this article employs the widely accepted practice of using the term ` risk - neutral measure ' to describe the probability measure obtained by the procedure of the preceding paragraph , and this practice is adopted here although its suitability is not clear to the author . )",
    "there is another inconsistency in the market - standard model that should be noted .",
    "as described in the previous paragraph , the market - standard model has a unique risk - neutral measure .",
    "as stated in @xcite , `` a model is complete if and only if @xmath48 consists of exactly one risk - neutral probability measure . '' here , @xmath48 is the set of all risk - neutral probabilty measures .",
    "since the risk - neutral measure in the market - standard model is unique , the theorem requires that the model is complete .",
    "however , if the model is complete , one should be able to replicate any contingent claim , and , because it has been shown above that illiquid cdss are not marketable , one can not replicate illiquid cdss .",
    "this subsection represents an extension of work begun in @xcite .",
    "in addition to single cdss , which were considered in the previous article , single - name cds portfolios are considered , and further comments on valuation and risk are added .",
    "consider an existing single - name portfolio of cdss , held by a dealer , in which all cdss are written on the same reference name .",
    "the net notional of all cdss in this existing portfolio with the same termination time @xmath16 is called @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath6 is the largest termination time considered .",
    "the portfolio itself consists of cdss with @xmath34 different termination times , and will be called the portfolio @xmath51 ( with no subscript @xmath31 ) .",
    "the portfolio @xmath51 will be assumed to include at least one illiquid cds , and is therefore not marketable .",
    "( the value of a portfolio containing only cdss on the liquid market is simply the sum of the market prices of the component cdss . )",
    "the dealer ( also called the seller ) can exit the position in @xmath51 by selling this position to a buyer .",
    "the prospective buyer can obtain information about the attractiveness of @xmath51 as an investment by examining the properties of a particular hedged position constructed by adding cdss from the liquid market to @xmath51 .",
    "the net notional of the added cds from the liquid market with termination time @xmath16 is called @xmath52 , @xmath50 .",
    "( readers , please remember that the tilde , as in @xmath52 , identifies a cds on the liquid market . )",
    "the notional @xmath53 by definition if there is no cds with termination time @xmath16 on the current liquid market .",
    "also , a cash deposit @xmath54 will be added to the dealer s position .",
    "the portfolio of added market cdss is called @xmath55 , the portfolio @xmath56 is called the hedge , and the portfolio @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is called the hedged position .",
    "it is important to note that the hedged position @xmath59 will be constructed below using the procedure ( [ optimization ] ) , and thus satisfies the constraints indicated in that procedure .",
    "the present value of the payoff stream of the hedged position @xmath59 when the underlying name follows the path @xmath1 is @xmath60 the values of the notionals @xmath52 , for maturities that are on the liquid market , as well as @xmath54 , are determined by the optimization procedure @xmath61 . \\label{optimization}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath62 in ( [ optimization ] ) is defined for cdss on the market to be the upfront cost of buying unit notional of the cds with termination time @xmath16 .",
    "( recall that , for termination times @xmath16 not on the liquid market , the quantity @xmath53 by definition . )",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is the cost of adding the hedge @xmath64 to the portfolio @xmath51 .",
    "the minimum value of this cost , obtained by the procedure ( [ optimization ] ) , is @xmath65 .",
    "note that there must be at least one payoff stream @xmath1 of the hedged position for which @xmath66 has the value zero ( the minimum value allowed by the constraint of ( [ optimization ] ) ) .",
    "this can be seen by supposing that the result of carrying out the procedure ( [ optimization ] ) gives a function @xmath66 that satisfies @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , for all @xmath69 and @xmath15 $ ] . then the quantity @xmath65 of ( [ optimization ] ) can be lowered by lowering @xmath54 ; thus @xmath70 must be 0 .",
    "also note that the payoff streams of the hedged position are non - negative for all possible paths @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that the expected value @xmath71 of the hedged position ( which , for example , in this article will be computed using the physical probability densities described in the appendix [ parameters ] ) must also be non - negative .",
    "the appropriate results for the case where there are no cdss on the current liquid market are obtained by taking @xmath72 in ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ optimization ] ) .",
    "suppose , now , that a dealer holding the portfolio @xmath51 plans to sell the portfolio to an investor .",
    "the dealer also pays to the investor the cost @xmath65 of the hedge that the investor can add to @xmath51 in order to form the hedged position @xmath59 .",
    "the investor can thus acquire at zero cost the position @xmath59 that has only non - negative payoff streams . at this stage ,",
    "the investor is able to obtain an arbitrage profit .",
    "however , because of the arbitrage profit , there will be competition for the hedged position under these terms , and the dealer will be able to insist that the investor return some fraction @xmath73 and @xmath74 to be determined , of the expected profit @xmath71 .",
    "expected values here are determined using the physical probability density .",
    "the details of the simple physical probability density used in numerical examples below are given in the appendix [ parameters ] .",
    "the amount that the dealer can realize from this transaction is thus @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the greatest lower bound ( glb ) on the range of arbitrage - free prices at which the investor can buy @xmath51 .",
    "the price @xmath77 , @xmath78 is a fair price .",
    "the fact that prices corresponding to @xmath78 are called fair prices , does not necessarily means that these prices represent good deals for either the buyer or the seller ( see below ) .",
    "the investor can make arbitrage profits by buying at a price lower than or equal to @xmath79 , corresponding to negative @xmath80 , and acquires a potentially profitable but risky position by buying at a price higher than @xmath79 .",
    "the portfolio @xmath81 is the investor s net position after acquiring and hedging @xmath51 , and paying the amount @xmath82 to the seller .",
    "since @xmath59 is non - negative , with a minimum value of 0 , the quantity @xmath83 is the maximum possible loss of the investor s net position ( also called the capital at risk ) .",
    "the maximum possible loss occurs when the path @xmath1 is such that @xmath84 .",
    "a useful interpretation of equation ( [ psi ] ) is that the position @xmath85 is the result of the investor starting with zero cash and buying the hedged position @xmath59 at the price @xmath86 .",
    "the hedged position @xmath59 , if held until the maximum maturity of the component cdss , or the default time @xmath12 , whichever is sooner , has a realized present value of @xmath66 , and the present value of the realized profit and loss of the investor is @xmath87 .",
    "the investor who purchases the position @xmath59 , will have a realized rate of return on the capital at risk , @xmath88 , often just called the rate of return , which is @xmath89 the rate of return is a random variable bearing both default risk ( through its dependence on the default time @xmath12 ) and recovery risk ( through its dependence on the recovery rate @xmath13 ) .",
    "the investor s expected rate of return is @xmath90 this equation relates the investor s expected rate of return @xmath91 to the price @xmath86 paid for the position @xmath59 . since no - arbitrage constraints require only that @xmath74 should be positive , these constraints allow a wide range of fair prices @xmath86 .",
    "the dealer who sells the position @xmath59 , and the investor who buys it , must agree on a price @xmath86 or , equivalently , on the expected rate of return of the package acquired by the investor .",
    "it will be appreciated that it is not just the expected return @xmath91 that gives a portfolio its value : the relationship between the expected return and the standard deviation of the return , or other measures of the benefits and risks of the transaction to the participants , should play a role in their determination of what price , within the range of fair prices , would constitut a good deal for them .",
    "it is clear that , in order to value derivative positions that are not marketable , and where risk - neutral pricing is not able to define a unique value for the position , disciplines such as risk management may be usefully called upon to contribute to the understanding of value .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that the absence of a replicating portfolio with which to hedge is an important source of risk .    given that risk - neutral pricing theory determines only the range of arbitrage - free values allowed for the price of an illiquid cds , and not a definite price , an investorwill probably want to make use of some of tools developed to measure the risk associated with the hedged position @xmath66 , and hence the risk associated with the rate of return .",
    "these tools are illustrated in section [ numerical ] where the results of a number of numerical calculations are described , including 1 ) a graphical description of the possible realized values of @xmath66 , 2 ) a plot of the probability density for @xmath59 ( which also gives the probability density for the profit and loss , @xmath85 ) , and 3 ) a figure showing the effect on the riskiness of an illiquid cds , of reduced liquidity due to a reduction in the number of cdss on the liquid market .",
    "section [ numerical ] has its own introduction to these and other numerical results .    in section",
    "[ parameters ] an expression that is somewhat simplistic is suggested for @xmath92 for the purpose of carrying out example calculations . in practice , it will be necessary to undertake a detailed credit analysis of the reference name in question , and to explore a number of scenarios that are the most likely to affect the peformance of the cds that is to be valued .",
    "appropriate probability density functions @xmath92 should be constructed for each scenario , and results for the different scenarios judged to most likely to affect the performance of the cds should be taken into account in the final valuation . for this purpose , the function @xmath92 could be extended to include a @xmath12-dependent hazard rate , and a @xmath12-dependent function @xmath93 .",
    "the benefits of integrating scenario analysis and sound risk - management practices into the valuation process were identified in a report @xcite issued during the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis , and based on a survey targeting large firms that had `` concentrated exposure to securitizations of u.s .",
    "subprime mortgage - related credit . ''",
    "although the recommendations did not target credit default swaps , cdss and structured credit products are both credit derivatives , and the recommendations seem to make sense for both markets .",
    "this has provided motivation for a view of the modelling of financial credit derivatives as an integrated modelling and risk management problem , as has been emphasized in @xcite , for example .      a dealer who buys a short - protection cds contract of notional @xmath94 from an investor",
    "is said to sell protection to the investor .",
    "when the dealer buys this short - protection contract , one of the conditions will be that the investor pay the dealer the amount @xmath95 required to purchase the hedge which , when added to @xmath51 , will produce @xmath96 , the hedged position associated with unit notional of the short position . because the position @xmath96 , by itself , will make arbitrage profits for the dealer , an informed investor will insist that the dealer return a fraction @xmath97 of the expected profit , @xmath98 .",
    "the dealer thus receives the upfront payment @xmath99 as above , this payment is a fair price for @xmath74 satisfying the given inequality .",
    "also as above , the participants in the deal will each have to balance considerations of expected return versus risk to make sure that the final agreed price within the range of fair prices is consistent with their firm s goals .",
    "the quantity @xmath100 is the least upper bound ( lub ) on the arbitrage - free range of ask prices .",

    "it has been shown @xcite , by applying the duality theorem , that @xmath110 it was noted above that a dealer who sells protection to an investor receives the payment @xmath111 from the investor , while a dealer who buys protection from an investor makes the payment @xmath105 to the investor .",
    "these payments depend on dealer and customer preferences , and one would expect a dealer to negotiate a net profit on the assumption of selling and buying equal notionals . thus , one expects the dealer to set the ask and bid prices such that @xmath112 .",
    "this is a dealer imposed preference argument , and not an arbitrage argument .",

    "this section groups together figures obtained by numerical calculation using the incomplete - market approach and illustrating various risk- and value - related properties of single - name cds portfolios .",
    "the figures describe a number of interesting behaviors not found in calculations using the market standard approach .",

    "this subsection also produces a plot showing @xmath66 for a single - name cds portfolio containing cdss of randomly generated notionals for all quarterly maturities from @xmath116 to @xmath4 quarters . the recovery rate in this article is taken to be a random variable , while typically , the recovery rate in the market - standard approach is taken to be a constant known in advance .",
    "subsection [ rhoconstpdpl ] calculates the probability density of the profit and loss for the case that the recovery rate is a constant , and finds that the result is qualitatively quite different from that in which the recovery rate is a random variable .",
    "the case where the recovery rate is a random variable better reflects the real situation .        a process for determining the arbitrage - free ranges of the bid and ask prices for single cdss is described in subsection [ nab ] . some results for the arbitrage - free price ranges for the bid and ask prices of single cdss described by the parameters in section [ parameters ] are shown here .",
    "the circles labelled @xmath117 in figure [ boundsbidask ] give the least upper bounds on the ranges of arbitrage - free ask prices ( @xmath118 ) for cdss of maturities @xmath31 = 1 to 21 quarters .",
    "( the index @xmath31 that denotes the maturity of the cds is omitted in this discussion , so that @xmath119 . ) for a given quarter , any price @xmath120 represents a possible arbitrage - free ask price .",
    "also , any price , @xmath121 will yield an arbitrage profit for the dealer who is assumed to be the protection seller . on the other hand , the squares",
    "labelled @xmath109 give the greatest lower bound on the arbitrage - free range of bid prices and any price @xmath122 represents a possible arbitrage - free bid price .",
    "recall that maturities 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , and 21 quarters are on the liquid market ( see section [ parameters ] for the market prices ) . for these maturities , the upper and lower no - arbitrage bounds and the market price coincide .",
    "this subsection explains , using elementary methods , the principal features of the plot of no - arbitrage bounds for an illiquid cds versus maturity shown in figure [ boundsbidask ] .",
    "the presentation is intended to be accessible to a wide range of individuals with interests in quantitive finance who might be interested in the problem of valuing cdss .",
    "because of this , an effort has been made to make the subsection more or less self - contained , and to reduce the required knowledge of detailed incomplete - market techniques to a minimum .",
    "it has already been shown in subsection [ notmarketable ] that replicating portfolios can not be established for illiquid cdss , and it is the existence of a replicating portfolio that allows arbitrage profits to be made if the price deviates from its unique value , and thus requires the existence of a unique price .",
    "there is thus no unique price for illiquid cdss .",
    "the best that can be done for illiquid cdss ( or other nonreplicable contingent claims ) is to establish a range of fair prices .",
    "the basic idea is to establish , for an illiquid cds called @xmath51 , a hedged position called @xmath59 that has only payoff streams having non - negative realized present values .",
    "thus , all of the unhedged risks that would be borne by the buyer of the unhedged illiquid cds will be eliminated in the hedged position .",
    "the cost of the hedge that , when added to the illiquid cds to be valued , forms the hedged position , is called @xmath65 .",
    "if this cash amount @xmath65 is paid by the owner of @xmath51 to the buyer when the contract for @xmath51 is transferred to the buyer , the buyer can use the amount @xmath65 to buy the hedge .",
    "the buyer will then have effectively acquired the hedged position at zero cost .",
    "because the hedged position has only non - negative payoff streams , the buyer will make an arbitrage profit if there are no further payments .",
    "the seller will argue that this is not a fair price , and should be able to find a buyer who will agree to pay back to the seller some positive fraction @xmath123 of the arbitrage profit @xmath71 .",
    "the net payment of the buyer to the seller is therefore @xmath124 .",
    "this subsection will introduce a vanilla hedge that will be able to hedge all of the unhedged risks of the buyer of an illiquid cds in a very simple manner using only a single cds from the market",
    ". this will not be the optimum hedge , however , since the optimum hedge will be slightly cheaper and will use all available market cdss as described in subsection [ bidask ] .",
    "however , the optimum hedge is more complicated , and the procedure described here is simple , easily understood , and , in the examples considered , captures the essential features of the optimal hedge and is close in cost to that of the optimum hedge .",
    "now consider this process in more detail .",
    "the owner of the short - protection illiquid cds contract of unit notional and of maturity @xmath125 , called @xmath126 , sells it at time @xmath2 to a buyer .",
    "the buyer takes over this short - protection contract and immediately ( at time t = 0 ) hedges it by buying unit notional on the liquid - market , of the long - protection cds contract ( having the same reference name ) which is the closest maturity , say @xmath127 , in the direction of increasing maturity , to the maturity @xmath125 being hedged .",
    "this immediately reduces the unhedged risks of the buyer since now , all risks due to losses on default , as well as risks to variable spread payments , at times between @xmath2 and @xmath128 are perfectly offset by the combination of the two cdss .",
    "also , for @xmath129 between @xmath125 and @xmath127 , all losses on default that do occur are associated with the long - protection cds and represent a profit for the buyer , and not a risk .",
    "there remains the risk that , between these times , the buyer will have to pay the full spread payments associated with the long - protection cds , which are negative , if there is no default during this time .",
    "the total cost of the hedge for the short - protection illiquid cds contract of maturity @xmath125 is therefore @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the upfront cost of the long - protection liquid cds of maturity @xmath127 , the term @xmath132 is a cash contribution to the hedge to compensate for the potential negative spread payments .",
    "also , @xmath133 for @xmath134 is defined in ( [ udef ] ) , and the cash contribution proportional to @xmath29 in ( [ hedgecosts ] ) is approximately linear in @xmath135 the cash payment just referred to is what gives rise to the term @xmath54 in ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "the two cdss and the cash deposit @xmath54 make up the the hedged position @xmath59 that has only non - negative realized present values for its payoff streams .",
    "suppose that the illiquid contract to be sold , @xmath126 , is transferred to the buyer , and in addition , the seller gives to the buyer the cost of the hedge , @xmath136 .",
    "then the buyer acquires , at zero cost , a hedged position having only non - negative payoffs .",
    "this would allow the buyer to make an arbitrage profit , and effectively guarantees the sale of the cds , since there would be expected to be strong demand for securities that give arbitrage profits .",
    "in fact , the demand for such securities should result in a buyer being found that would be willing to return a certain fraction ( say @xmath74 ) of the expected profits @xmath71 from the hedged position .",
    "( the amount returned to the seller is called @xmath82 , following subsection [ bidask ] ) .",
    "now consider an investor ( the seller ) who sells at time @xmath137 a long - protection illiquid cds called @xmath138 of unit notional and of maturity @xmath125 .",
    "the no - arbitrage bound for this case is again found by constructing a hedged position @xmath59 that has only non - negative payoffs . to construct a hedged position with only non - negative payoffs ,",
    "one begins by buying unit notional on the liquid - market , of the short - protection cds contract which is the closest maturity , say @xmath139 , in the direction of decreasing maturity , to the maturity @xmath125 being hedged .",
    "this immediately reduces the unhedged risks of the buyer since now , all risks due to losses on default as well as spread payments at times between @xmath2 and @xmath128 are perfectly offset by the combination of the two cdss .",
    "also , for @xmath129 between @xmath139 and @xmath125 all losses on default that do occur represent a profit for the buyer , and not a risk .",
    "there remains the risk that the buyer will have to pay the full spread payment , which is negative , between times @xmath140 and @xmath141 if there is no default during this time .",
    "the total cost of the hedge for the long - protection illiquid cds of maturity @xmath125 is @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the upfront cost of the short - protection liquid cds of maturity @xmath139 , and the term proportional to @xmath29 is a cash payment from the seller to the buyer to compensate for the potential negative spread payments .",
    "the two cdss and the cash deposit @xmath54 make up the position @xmath59 that has only non - negative realized present values for its payoff streams",
    ".    note that for ( [ hedgecostl ] ) to be applicable to the maturity @xmath125 , there must be a liquid maturity on the market that is shorter than @xmath125 .",
    "this is not the case for maturities @xmath125 less than @xmath144 quarters in figure [ boundsbidask ] . for this case",
    ", the loss on default of the long - protection cds that one wants to hedge always represents a non - negative payoff for the holder of the illiquid contract . only the spread payments that occur in cases when there is no default need to be offset so that the buyer will take over , at zero risk , a position with only non - negative payoffs .",
    "the cost of these offsetting spread payments is @xmath145    the notation used to describe the no - arbitrage bounds in subsection [ bidask ] and in figure [ boundsbidask ] is @xmath146 and @xmath147 , except that the @xmath148 is suppressed in the figure .. the analytical expressions given for @xmath136 and @xmath149 in equations [ hedgecosts ] , [ hedgecostl ] , and [ hedgecostlsmall ] enable one to understand the main qualitative features of these bounds as plotted in figure [ boundsbidask ] .",
    "the upfront prices for the available liquid cdss can be read off figure [ boundsbidask ] for the maturities 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , and 21 quarters . as an example , consider the illiquid cdss having maturities 14 , 15 , and 16 quarters , which are bracketed by the liquid maturities 13 and 17 quarters .",
    "the ask - price no - arbitrage bounds for the 14 , 15 , and 16 quarter maturities lie on an approximately straight line anchored by the market price of the 17 quarter liquid maturity ( @xmath127 ) cds . as the illiquid maturity in question ( 16 , 15 , and 14 ) gets further from this anchor , the contribution to ask - price no - arbitrage bound grows linearly with decreasing maturity ( e.g. see ( [ hedgecosts ] ) ) .",
    "the magnitude of the increase in the no - arbitrage bound with decrease in illiquid maturity starting from a given liquid maturity anchor point is nearly the same for each of the liquid maturities taken as the anchor point .",
    "( there is a slight magnification of this increase at lower liquid maturity anchor points due to the fact that the effect of the discount factors @xmath150 is larger . )",
    "the situation is very similar for the bid price no - arbitrage bounds , except that the anchor points for these are liquid - maturity prices lying to the left of the illiquid maturities of which one wants to find the no - arbitrage bounds .",
    "it is important to note that the no - arbitrage bound do not behave as if they were interpolated between the prices of liquid cdss , but rather , in the example considered , the illiquid ask price bounds are extrapolated to lower maturities from the nearest higher maturity liquid cds market price , and the illiquid bid price bounds are extrapolated to higher maturities from the nearest lower maturity liquid cds market price .       also , in order to find the statistical properties of the portfolios of interest , it is necessary to specify the physical probability density for the default time @xmath12 ( called @xmath151 ) , and the physical probability density for the recovery rate @xmath13 given a particular default time @xmath12 , called @xmath93 .",
    "a simplifying assumption made in this article is that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are independent random variables , so that @xmath152 .",
    "the probability density @xmath153 is taken to be that segment of a normal probability density of mean @xmath154 and standard deviation @xmath155 existing for @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the probability density for the default time , @xmath151 , is specified in terms of a constant hazard rate @xmath156 so that @xmath157",
    ". also , the hazard rate @xmath156 is simply estimated in terms of the probability of default within one year , @xmath158 , using @xmath159 .",
    "there is no difficulty in principle to specifying @xmath151 and @xmath93 numerically to have any desired form .",
