    "large quasar groups ( lqgs ) are the largest structures seen in the early universe , of characteristic size @xmath1 70350  mpc , with the highest values appearing to be only marginally compatible with the @xcite scale of homogeneity in the concordance cosmology .",
    "lqgs generally have @xmath1 540 member quasars .",
    "the first three lqgs to be discovered were those of : @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; and @xcite . for more recent work",
    "see , for example : @xcite ( radio galaxies ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "the association of quasars with superclusters in the relatively local universe has been discussed by , for example : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "the last three of these papers note the association of quasars with the peripheries of clusters or with filaments . at higher redshifts , @xcite and @xcite",
    "suggest that the lqgs are the precursors of the superclusters seen today .",
    "given the large sizes of lqgs , perhaps they are instead the precursors of supercluster complexes such as the sloan great wall @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we presented results for two lqgs as they appeared in the dr7 quasar catalogue (  dr7qso  , * ? ? ? * ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "one of these lqgs , designated u1.28 in that paper , was the previously known @xcite lqg ( cclqg ) and the other , designated u1.11 , was a new discovery .",
    "( in these designations u1.28 and u1.11 the `` u '' refers to a connected unit of quasars , and the number refers to the mean redshift . )",
    "u1.28 and u1.11 had memberships of 34 and 38 quasars respectively , and characteristic sizes ( volume@xmath0 ) of @xmath7  mpc .",
    "@xcite give an idealised upper limit to the scale of homogeneity in the concordance cosmology as @xmath1 370  mpc .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , if the fractal calculations of @xcite are adopted as reference then u1.28 and u1.11 are only marginally compatible with homogeneity",
    ".    in this paper we present results for a new lqg , designated u1.27 , again found in the dr7qso catalogue , which is noteworthy for both its exceptionally large characteristic size , @xmath1 500  mpc , and its exceptionally high membership , 73 quasars .",
    "it provides further interest for discussions of homogeneity and the validity of the cosmological principle .    for simplicity we shall also refer to u1.27 as the huge - lqg and u1.28 as the cclqg ( for clowes & campusano lqg ) .",
    "the largest structure in the local universe is the sloan great wall ( sgw ) at @xmath8 , as noted in particular by @xcite .",
    "they give its length ( proper size at the present epoch ) as @xmath1 450  mpc , compared with @xmath1 240  mpc for the @xcite great wall ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "although @xcite do not discuss in detail the compatibility of the sgw with concordance cosmology and gaussian initial conditions , from visual inspection of simulations they did not expect any incompatibility .",
    "@xcite have investigated this question of compatibility further and concluded that , given the assumptions of their analysis , there is a potential difficulty , which can , however , be avoided if the sgw , in our cosmological neighbourhood , happens to be the densest structure of its volume within the entire hubble volume .",
    "the @xcite paper is , however , not an analysis of compatibility of the sgw with homogeneity .",
    "homogeneity asserts that the mass - energy density ( or , indeed , any global property ) of sufficiently large volumes should be the same within the expected statistical variations .",
    "@xcite estimate the volume of the sgw as @xmath10  mpc@xmath11 , for the larger of two group - linkage estimates , which roughly reproduces the portrayal of the sgw by @xcite . a characteristic size  ( volume)@xmath0",
    " is then @xmath12  mpc .",
    "the sgw is markedly elongated so this measure of characteristic size should not be compared with the overall length .",
    "the overdensity is given as @xmath13 for mass and @xmath14 for number of galaxies .",
    "note that @xcite find that the sgw is not a single structure , but a set of superclusters with different evolutionary histories .",
    "for discussing potential conflicts of the sgw with homogeneity this result by @xcite means that the long dimension of @xmath1 450  mpc is misleading .",
    "the characteristic size of @xmath12  mpc is still relevant , but is much smaller than the upper limit of @xmath15  mpc for homogeneity @xcite , and so it may be that the sgw does not present any particular problem . indeed , @xcite find from the `` horizon run 2 '' cosmological simulation that the sgw is consistent with concordance cosmology and with homogeneity .",
    "@xcite also note that the properties of lsss can be used as sensitive discriminants of cosmological models and models of galaxy formation .",
    "the concordance model is adopted for cosmological calculations , with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19  kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 .",
    "all sizes given are proper sizes at the present epoch .",
    "the new , huge - lqg ( u1.27 ) has been detected by the procedures described in @xcite .",
    "these procedures are briefly described here .    as mentioned above",
    ", the source of the quasar data is the sdss dr7qso catalogue @xcite of 105783 quasars .",
    "the low - redshift , @xmath21 , strand of selection of the sdss specifies @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "restriction of the quasars to this limit allows satisfactory spatial uniformity of selection on the sky to be achieved , since they are then predominantly from this strand .",
    "also , changes in the sdss selection algorithms @xcite should not then be important .",
    "the more general criteria for extraction of a statistical sample from the dr7qso catalogue or its predecessors are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the dr7qso catalogue covers @xmath1 9380  deg@xmath23 in total .",
    "there is a large contiguous area of @xmath1 7600  deg@xmath23 in the north galactic gap , which has some jagged boundaries . within this contiguous area",
    "we define a control area , designated a3725 , of @xmath1 3725 deg@xmath23 ( actually 3724.5 deg@xmath23 ) by ra : @xmath24 and dec : @xmath25 .",
    "we detect candidates for lqgs in the catalogue by three - dimensional single - linkage hierarchical clustering , which is equivalent to the three - dimensional minimal spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "such algorithms have the advantage that they do not require assumptions about the morphology of the structure . as in @xcite ,",
    "the linkage scale is set to 100  mpc .",
    "the choice of scale is guided by the mean nearest - neighbour separation together with allowance for redshift errors and peculiar velocities ; see that paper for full details .",
    "the particular algorithm we use for single - linkage hierarchical clustering is the _ agnes _ algorithm in the _",
    "r package_. we are currently concentrating on detecting lqgs in the redshift interval @xmath26 and , of course , with the restriction @xmath22 .    with this detection procedure the new huge - lqg ( u1.27 ) that is the subject of this paper is detected as a unit of 73 quasars , with mean redshift 1.27 .",
    "it covers the redshift range @xmath27 .",
    "the 73 member quasars are listed in table  [ huge - lqg_table ] .",
    "the huge - lqg is @xmath28 north ( @xmath1 615  mpc projected ) of the cclqg at the same redshift . their boundaries on the sky approach to within @xmath6 ( @xmath1 140  mpc projected ) .",

    "[ visualisation_huge - lqg_cclqg ] shows a snapshot from a visualisation of the new , huge - lqg , and cclqg , the clowes & campusano lqg .",
    "the scales shown on the cuboid are proper sizes ( mpc ) at the present epoch .",
    "the member points of both lqgs are shown expanded to spheres of radius 33.0  mpc , which is half of the mean linkage ( mst edge length ) for the huge - lqg ( consistent with the chms method for this lqg ) .",
    "the morphology of the huge - lqg is clearly strongly elongated , and curved .",
    "there is the appearance of a dense , clumpy part , followed by a change in orientation and a more filamentary part .",
    "note that half of the mean linkage for the cclqg is actually 38.8  mpc , so , in this respect , the huge - lqg is more tightly connected than the cclqg .",
    "however , the chms - density is lower for huge - lqg than for cclqg because of the effect of the change in orientation on the chms of huge - lqg .",
    "that is , the huge - lqg is more tightly connected than cclqg ( 33.0  mpc compared with 38.8  mpc ) but its curvature causes its chms - volume to be disproportionately large ( there is more `` dead space '' ) and hence its density to be disproportionately low .",
    "note that the huge - lqg and the cclqg appear to be distinct entities  their chms volumes do not intersect .",
    "the chms method is thus conservative in its estimation of volume and hence of significance and overdensity .",
    "curvature of the structure can lead to the chms volume being substantially larger than if it was linear .",
    "if we divide the huge - lqg into two sections at the point at which the direction appears to change then we have a `` main '' set of 56 quasars and a `` branch '' set of 17 quasars .",
    "if we calculate the chms volumes of the main set and the branch set , using the same sphere radius ( 33  mpc ) as for the full set of 73 , and simply add them ( neglecting any overlap ) , then we obtain @xmath36 , using the same correction for residual bias ( 2 per cent ) as for the full set .",
    "that is , we have calculated @xmath37 using the total membership ( 73 ) and the summed volume of the main set and the branch set , and the result is now @xmath38 , rather than @xmath39 , since much of the `` dead space '' has been removed from the volume estimate .",
    "we should consider the possibility that the change in direction is indicating that , physically if not algorithmically , we have two distinct structures at the same redshift .",
    "so , if we instead treat the main and branch sets as two independent lqg candidates and use their respective sphere radii for calculation of chms volumes , including their respective corrections for residual bias , then we obtain the following parameters .",
    "main set of 56 : significance @xmath40 ; @xmath41 ; characteristic size ( chms - volume@xmath0 ) 390  mpc ; mean linkage 65.1  mpc ; and principal axes of the inertia tensor @xmath1 930 , 410 , 320  mpc .",
    "branch set of 17 : significance @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ; characteristic size ( chms - volume@xmath0 ) 242  mpc ; mean linkage 67.7  mpc ; and principal axes of the inertia tensor @xmath1 570 , 260 , 150  mpc .",
    "the similarity of the mean linkages suggests , after all , a single structure with curvature rather than two distinct structures .",
    "( note for comparison that the cclqg has mean linkage of 77.5  mpc . )",
    "a two - sided mann - whitney test finds no significant differences of the linkages for the main and branch sets , which again suggests a single structure .",
    "note also that the main set by itself exceeds the @xcite scale of homogeneity .",
    "we can estimate the masses of these main and branch sets from their chms volumes by assuming that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 refers to the mass in baryons and dark matter ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we find that the mass contained within the main set is @xmath46 and within the branch set is @xmath47 . compared with the expectations for their volumes",
    "these values correspond to mass excesses of @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the total mass excess is then @xmath50 , equivalent to @xmath1 1300 coma clusters @xcite , @xmath1 50 shapley superclusters @xcite , or @xmath51 sloan great walls @xcite .",
    "some independent corroboration of this large structure is provided by mg ii absorbers .",
    "we have used the dr7qso quasars in a survey for intervening mgii @xmath52 absorbers @xcite . using this survey , fig .",
    "[ mgii_huge - lqg_cclqg ] shows a kernel - smoothed intensity map ( similar to fig .",
    "[ skydist_huge - lqg_cclqg ] ) of the mgii absorbers across the field of the huge - lqg and the cclqg , and for their joint redshift range ( @xmath53 ) . for this map ,",
    "only dr7qso quasars with @xmath54 have been used as probes of the mgii  that is , only quasars beyond the lqgs , and none within them . however , background quasars that are known from the dr7qso `` catalog of properties '' @xcite to be bal ( broad absorption line ) quasars have been excluded because structure within the bal troughs can lead to spurious detections of mgii doublets at similar apparent redshifts .",
    "the background quasars have been further restricted to @xmath55 for uniformity of coverage .",
    "a similar kernel - smoothed intensity map ( not shown here ) verifies that the distribution of the used background quasars is indeed appropriately uniform across the area of the figure .",
    "the mgii systems used here have rest - frame equivalent widths for the @xmath56 component of @xmath57 . for the resolution and signal - to - noise ratios of the sdss spectra ,",
    "this lower limit of @xmath58 appears to give consistently reliable detections , although , being `` moderately strong '' , it is higher than the value of @xmath59 that would typically be used with spectra from larger telescopes .",
    "note that apparent mgii systems occurring shortward of the ly-@xmath60 emission in the background quasars are assumed to be spurious and have been excluded .",
    "the ra - dec track of the huge - lqg quasars , along the @xmath61 where the surface density is highest , appears to be closely associated with the track of the mgii absorbers .",
    "the association becomes a little weaker in the following @xmath62 , following the change in direction from the main set to the branch set , where the surface density of the quasars becomes lower .",
    "note that the quasars tend to follow the periphery of the structure in the mgii absorbers , which is reminiscent of the finding by @xcite and @xcite that quasars tend to lie on the peripheries of galaxy clusters .",
    "note that the cclqg is less clearly detected in mgii here , although it was detected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite were able to achieve a lower equivalent - width limit @xmath59 with their observations on a 4 m telescope .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ mgii_huge - lqg_cclqg ] shows that the surface density of the huge - lqg quasars is clearly higher than for the cclqg quasars , which is presumably a factor in the successful detection of corresponding mgii absorption .",
    "the high surface density of the members of the huge - lqg seems likely to correspond to a higher probability of lines of sight to the background quasars intersecting the haloes of galaxies at small impact parameters .",
    "in @xcite we presented results for the cclqg , the clowes & campusano lqg , as it appeared in the sdss dr7qso catalogue , and also for u1.11 , a newly - discovered lqg in the same cosmological neighbourhood .",
    "we noted that their characteristic sizes , defined as ( chms - volume)@xmath0 , of @xmath1 350 and 380  mpc respectively were only marginally compatible with the @xcite 370-mpc upper limit to the scale of homogeneity for the concordance cosmology .",
    "their long dimensions from the inertia tensor of @xmath1 630 and 780  mpc are clearly much larger .    in the present paper",
    "we have presented results for the huge - lqg , another newly discovered lqg from the dr7qso catalogue , that is at essentially the same redshift as the cclqg , and only a few degrees to the north of it .",
    "it has 73 member quasars , compared with 34 and 38 for the cclqg and u1.11 .",
    "mgii absorbers in background quasars provide independent corroboration of this extraordinary lqg .",
    "the characteristic size of ( chms - volume)@xmath0 @xmath1 495  mpc is well in excess of the @xcite homogeneity scale , and the long dimension from the inertia tensor of @xmath1 1240  mpc is spectacularly so .",
    "it appears to be the largest feature so far seen in the early universe .",
    "even the `` main '' set alone , before the change of direction leading to the `` branch '' set , exceeds the homogeneity scale .",
    "this huge - lqg thus challenges the assumption of the cosmological principle .",
    "its excess mass , compared with expectations for its ( main @xmath30 branch ) volume , is @xmath63 , equivalent to @xmath1 1300 coma clusters , @xmath1 50 shapley superclusters , or @xmath51 sloan great walls .",
    "the usual models of the universe in cosmology , varying only according to the parameter settings , are built on the assumption of the cosmological principle - that is , on the assumption of homogeneity after imagined smoothing on some suitably large scale .",
    "in particular , the models depend on the robertson - walker metric , which assumes the homogeneity of the mass - energy density .",
    "given the further , sensible assumption that any property of the universe ultimately depends on the mass - energy content then homogeneity naturally asserts that any global property of sufficiently large volumes should be the same within the expected statistical variations .",
    "a recent review of _ inhomogeneous _ models is given by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xcite fractal calculations as our reference for the upper limit to the scale of homogeneity in the concordance model of cosmology : inhomogeneities should not be detectable above this limit of @xmath1 370  mpc .",
    "the @xcite calculations have the appealing features that the scale of homogeneity is essentially independent of both the epoch and the tracer used .",
    "note that the scale of @xmath1 370  mpc is much larger than the scales of @xmath1 100115  mpc for homogeneity deduced by @xcite , and , for our purposes , it is therefore appropriately cautious .    the cosmic microwave background is usually considered to provide the best evidence for isotropy , and hence of homogeneity too , given the assumption of isotropy about all points .",
    "nevertheless , there do appear to be large - scale features in the cmb that may challenge the reality of homogeneity and isotropy  see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "more recently still than this review , @xcite find further indications of a violation of statistical isotropy in the cmb .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that supernovae in the redshift range 0.51.0 are associated with systematic cmb temperature fluctuations , possibly arising from large - scale inhomogeneities .",
    "observationally , for sdss dr7 galaxies with @xmath64 , @xcite find that isotropy about all points does indeed apply on scales larger than @xmath1 210  mpc .    while @xcite find a transition to homogeneity on scales @xmath1 100115  mpc , using wigglez data",
    ", @xcite does not , on scales up to @xmath1 200  mpc , using sdss galaxies .",
    "large inhomogeneities in the distribution of superclusters ( supercluster complexes ) such as the sloan great wall and in the voids have also been found on scales @xmath1 200300  mpc by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and earlier references given within these papers .",
    "evidence for gpc - scale correlations of galaxies has been presented by , for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of structure on gpc - scales from the huge - lqg and from galaxies implies that the universe is not homogeneous on these scales .",
    "furthermore , if we accept that homogeneity refers to any property of the universe then an intriguing result is that of @xcite , who found that the polarisation vectors of quasars are correlated on gpc - scales .",
    "similarly , the existence of cosmic flows on approximately gpc - scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , regardless of their cause , is itself implying that the universe is not homogeneous .",
    "of course , history and , most recently , the work of @xcite indicate that one should certainly be cautious on the question of homogeneity and the cosmological principle . the sloan great wall @xcite  and before it , the great wall @xcite  was seen as a challenge to the standard cosmology and yet @xcite show that , in the `` horizon run 2 '' concordance simulation of box - side 10  gpc , comparable and even larger features can arise , although they are of course rare .",
    "nevertheless , the huge - lqg presented here is much larger , and it is adjacent to the cclqg , which is itself very large , so the challenges still persist .",
    "@xcite find that void complexes on scales up to @xmath1 450 mpc are also compatible with the concordance cosmology , according to their simulations , although the scales here are greater than the @xcite scale of homogeneity and much greater than the @xcite scale .",
    "also , @xcite find evidence for a local void on scales @xmath1 430  mpc .",
    "the question of what exactly is a `` void complex '' might need further attention .",
    "it seems likely to correspond to the `` supervoid '' of @xcite and earlier references given there .",
    "@xcite have investigated homogeneity within the past light - cone , rather than on it , using the fossil record of star formation and find no marked variation on a scale of @xmath1 340  mpc for @xmath65    @xcite finds , from ultra - compact radio sources limited to @xmath66 , that the universe is not homogeneous on the largest scales : there is more dark matter in some directions than in others .",
    "the huge - lqg and the cclqg separately and together would also indicate that there is more dark matter in some directions than in others .",
    "such mass concentrations could conceivably be associated with the cosmic ( dark ) flows on scales of @xmath1 100 - 1000  mpc as reported by , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the possibility raised by @xcite that those living within a large - scale cosmic flow could see local acceleration of the expansion within a universe that is decelerating overall .",
    "tsagas notes that the proximity of the supernova dipole to the cmb dipole could support such an origin for the apparent acceleration that we see . with quasars mostly extinguished by the present epoch , we would probably have some difficulty in recognising the counterparts today of such lqgs then that might cause such cosmic flows .",
    "very massive structures in the relatively local universe could conceivably be present , but unrecognised .    in summary",
    ", the huge - lqg presents an interesting potential challenge to the assumption of homogeneity in the cosmological principle .",
    "its proximity to the cclqg at the same redshift adds to that challenge .",
    "switching attention from galaxies in the relatively local universe to lqgs at redshifts @xmath67 may well have advantages for such testing since the broad features of the structures can be seen with some clarity , although , of course , the fine details can not .",
