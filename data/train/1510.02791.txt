    "he industrial and research understanding of atomic interactions often ignore some pertubations in the molecular dynamics . some readily available applications , which indicate these perturbations , can be found in the solar panel surface sputtering which is also an important factor in its effectiveness , thus the need for anti - relective coats on its surface ^@xcite^. even the best of water and chemical proof materials ^@xcite^ and materials that will one day allow us to breathe under water are now being developed ^@xcite^. many atimes there are different degrees of energy absorption on different surfaces .",
    "biological surfaces energy spread differ from that of the inorganics , this is why it is important to design chemically inert surfaces ^@xcite^ and develop artificial antimicrobial activity of water resistant surface coating ^@xcite^. in some other applications , nano scale energy transport might not be required . however , in others like those above there is a need to study nano scale energy transport so as to effectively monitor the delivery of energy to the active atoms .      in this work ,",
    "we want to incoporate the surface sputtering processes ^@xcite^,^@xcite^,^@xcite^ to molecular interactions ^@xcite^. this is because the materials are not operating in isolation from their environments .",
    "while the material is undergoing molecular dynamics ( within its bulk ) , its surface is always being bombarded with foreign particles .",
    "in essence , the molecular dynamics is perturbed ^@xcite^ by the energy thrown downwards by the approching foreign particle .",
    "therefore , all materials are in constant tune with their environment , which implies that we must develop a potential for the molecular interactions to incoporate this surface sputtering section of the interactions .",
    "we are convinced that the molecular dynamics perturbations in a material , as a result of bombardments on its surface by foreign particles , is peculiar to the surface .",
    "the essence of developing a general potential is to be able to apply the single potential to any ( or most ) materials located in any environment . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss some potentials in literature which are not general enough for achieving our goal .",
    "we shall itemize the well known potentials as follows , source : ^@xcite^ :    * @xmath0+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i \\sum_{j\\ne i}\\phi_{ij}\\left(r_{ij}\\right)\\ ] ] + this is the many - body embeded - atom model ( eam ) potentials .",
    "where @xmath1 is the electron density of the host at the site of atom @xmath2 , @xmath3 $ ] is the embedding functional , that is , the energy to embed an extra atom @xmath2 into the background electron density,@xmath4 and @xmath5 is a pairwise central potential between atoms @xmath2 and @xmath6 , separated by a distance @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath5 represents the repulsive core - core electrostatic interaction .",
    "the electron density of the host lattice is a linear superposition of the individual contributions and is given as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is also a pairwise term and is the electron density of atom @xmath6 as a function of interatomic separation .",
    "the eam are developed based on existing density functional theory ( dft ) . according to dft",
    ", the energy of a collection of atoms can be expressed exactly by a functional of its electronic density .",
    "* @xmath10 + this is the many - body finnis - sinclair ( fs ) potentials developed with the intention to model the energetics of the transition metals . * _ they offer a better description of the surface relaxation in metals_*. they also avoid the problems , such as the appearance of the cauchy relation between the elastic constants @xmath11 which is not satisfied by cubic crystals , associated with using pair potentials to model metals . where @xmath12 @xmath13 is a pairwise repulsive interaction between atoms @xmath2 and @xmath6 , separated by a distance @xmath7 . also , @xmath14 are the two - body cohesive pair potentials , and @xmath15 is a positive constant .",

    "they only describe the energies of 10 fcc elemental metals .",
    "they are similar to the fs type potentials and also similar to eam potentials in form .",
    "sc potentials are very good for computer simulations of nanostructures involving large number of atoms , where @xmath17 is a parameter with the dimensions of energy , @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a parameter with the dimensions of length and usaully used to mean the equillibrium lattice constant .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are positive integers with @xmath23 .",
    "the power law form was adopted so as to enable the model to be unique in combining the short - range interactions ( due to the @xmath24-body second term of ( 5 ) ) and good for describing the * _ surface relaxation _ * phenomena using a van der waals tail which gives a better description of the long - range interactions .",
    "* @xmath25 + this is the many - body murrel - mottram ( mm ) potentials .",
    "they are examples of cluster - type potentials and consist of sums of effective two- and three - body interactions .",

    "the rts potentials are a form of generalization of the sc potentials and they model the energetics of the metallic fcc ( face centered crystal ) random binary alloys .",

    "to make the potential general for studying this energy transport , delivered into a material by sputtering ion(s ) , we want to relate the following , listed , processes to one another .",
    "the reason being that they are related in sequential manner .",
    "it is our believe that these processes are needed in the energy transport caused by sputtering process .    1 .",
    "the location of the landing ions will be called a sputtered location , 2 .",
    "the origin of the nano - scale energy transport is from the , delivered , energy spread at the sputtered location , 3 .",
    "all atoms captured by the energy spread will be regarded as the captured atoms , 4 .",
    "it is important to note that there could be different atomic elements within the captured space , 5 .",
    "the transportation of this energy causes ionizations of the captured atoms .",
    "different atomic elements will receive and respond to this energy differently , 6 .",
    "we plan to apply the , rapidly changing , papcs ( photon absorption potential coefficient ) of each atom in that captured space to study the variations in the way each atom * _ receives _ * energy , 7 .",
    "we have to note that even the same atoms , but located at different positions , in the sputtered location would become different due to papcs , 8",
    ".   then we provide a way to evaluate the energy of the captured atoms in the , growing , sputtered location .",
    "now , we concentrate on the development of two very crucial parameters : ( 1 ) the rate at which the number of ionised atoms increases and decreases due to the energy delivered by the sputtering particles landing on the surface and ( 2 ) the papc , which is essential in making the potential a general one and .      we could calculate the number of atoms that could be ionised by such energies as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the energy of the incoming ion and @xmath61 are the ionisation energies of the atoms in the lattice . for ionic lattices like that of nacl , we could have two unique forms of @xmath61 , that is : @xmath62 and @xmath63 . therefore , equation ( 20 )",
    "becomes @xmath64 since we are looking at both laboratory and general cases of materials , we shall consider cases where the atomic lattice is very irregular ( not necessarily amorphous ) as well .",
    "in such cases ( examples include a material made up of different homogenous layers of atoms ) , we have atomic arrangements where , say the @xmath43 atoms are grouped together , more at a point , than at others .",
    "ditto @xmath65 atoms .",
    "for such complex molecules we have : @xmath66    please note that we can not write ( 21 and 22 ) as : @xmath67 because    * even though the @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath68 atoms are fundamentally the same , they are electronically different at any point in time . *",
    "the direction or path along which the atoms receive energy must also be considered in determining how much of energy is left for subsequent ionisations . * the atoms",
    "might not be located close to one another at equal distances , * it is also important that we discuss the fact that the population of ionised atoms is always changing in the lattice .",
    "this is because initially as the sputtering process starts , we shall have a larger number of first ionisation atoms but as the sputtering process increases , we have that number reducing while the number of nth ionisation atoms also increases . * the point , just above , is what we have identified as a major reason why contributions to sputtering yield by temperature variations is crucial to a successful model for surface interactions .",
    "research works on the contributions of temperature to sputtering yield is scarce and the very few model for such case is stated as follows : @xmath69 ^@xcite^ where @xmath70 is the ripple wavelength , @xmath71 is the temperature , @xmath72 is the activation energy of the system and @xmath73 is the boltzman constant .",
    "let us consider , for now , two groups of ionisations : first and second ionisations .",
    "the first ionisation is handled as : @xmath74 while the second as : @xmath75 as @xmath76 increases , the @xmath77 reduces and @xmath78 increases .",
    "however , the equations above are similar to : @xmath79 where n is the total number of atoms in the lattice , assuming that we can only have two ( first and second ) ionisations .    in general , for a complex system",
    ", we have : @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath68 @xmath83",
    "so we have : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath68 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath68 please note that @xmath91,@xmath92,@xmath93 etc population will be @xmath94 at the initial stages of the sputtering process . as time factor @xmath76 grows , @xmath91,@xmath92,@xmath93 will start emerging while @xmath77,@xmath78 start disappearing .",
    "now , we can re - write equation ( 22 ) as : @xmath95    * please note that @xmath76 is the condition of time frame during the whole process of sputtering , * also , we shall define @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath68 as the conditions for the transfer of ionisation from one stage to another , * the @xmath98 in equations ( 28 ) to ( 31 ) is for the purpose of linking one stage of ionisation to the other , * the @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath68 in equations ( 28 ) to ( 31 ) are the initial numbers of each stage of ionisation .",
    "papc is our way of finding out the way similar ( such as two na atoms but at different ionisations ) or different ( such as na and cl atoms at the same or different ionisations ) atoms would react to the energy delivered by the sputtering ion(s ) .",
    "therefore , we arrive at the following : @xmath99 equation(36 ) can also be written as : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is is given as : @xmath102 and @xmath103 is is given as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the extra subtracted and added electrons of the neutral electrons of the atom in question .",
    "take for instance , the @xmath107 of an atom like @xmath108 is will be given as :    * for first ionisation , we have : @xmath109 and @xmath110 . @xmath111 * for second ionisation , we have : @xmath112 and @xmath113 . @xmath114 * for third ionisation , we have : @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117      to further study this perturbation , we shall apply the principle that the energy thrown off by the , gradually , approaching foreign particle captures and causes an ionization of a group of atoms on the surface .",
    "this , group , ionization leads to a build up of forceful repulsive energy amongst the captured atoms .",
    "this repulsion eventually translates to surface sputtering and penetration of the incoming particle .",
    "therefore , this incoming particle s energy does work on the surface of the material it approaches . to this end , we introduce the proposed work done on the surface by the incoming beams of ions . before we state",
    "the proposed work done , we state the repulsion potential suitable for our work done , comparable to those well known potentials such as lennard - jones and morse s ^@xcite^,^@xcite^ , as follows : @xmath118 where    * @xmath119 is the energy of the incoming ion , * @xmath120 , [ where @xmath121 is the distance covered by the photon cone of the ion .",
    "if the sputtering angle , @xmath122 which can take values from 0 and 90 degrees , is @xmath123 , that is the approach on the surface is perpendicular to the surface , then we have @xmath124 .",
    "* @xmath125    * is the * _ lattice site occupation density _ * of the topograph of the surface in which the ion is to land .",
    "please note that the default @xmath126 region for a flat surface is a semi - circular shape .",
    "where @xmath127 is the sum of all atoms in the @xmath128 population .",
    "ditto others . * @xmath129 + is the property of the molecules on whom the ion is to land .",
    "the properties are the papc and the atomic numbers of the atoms of that molecule , where papc is given as earlier stated .",
    "@xmath130 where @xmath131 is the electronic charge and @xmath132 is the increasing distance of the transporting energy from the landing site of the foreign particle .",
    "* @xmath133 + is the quantity that determines the activation of the sputtering as the ion is approaching the surface .",
    "@xmath44 is a constant that stabilizes the rate of increment or reduction of @xmath134 , * @xmath135 + helps to activate the sputtering process .",
    "this is because when the ion is still far off , above the surface , there will not be sputtering but as it approaches the surface , the sputtering process starts to build , gradually",
    ". please see figure 1 for illustrations .",
    "therefore , we may wish to write : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the diameters of the atoms in the k region .",
    "finally , we now have the proposed work done on the surface , by one ion s photon shower , to be given as : @xmath138 @xmath139 we present the plots of our derived repulsion potential , for some selected ( flat ) surfaces at @xmath140 10ev , @xmath126 region is @xmath141 and @xmath142 0.5 , as a way to compare with the parameters of the repuslion potentials such as lennard - jones and morse s .",
    "now , we present the results of the simulation of equations ( 1 ) and ( 9 ) in the following diagrams .",
    "figures 1 and 2 illustrate how energy interactions with the surface are in phases , real sputtering is actived , gradually , as it gets closer to the surface .",
    "the circular shapes are the , default , gradual energy spreads .",
    "figures 3 to 8 are plots of the repulsive potentials against the repulsion distances @xmath134 .",
    "they are comparism between the literature ( lennard - jones and morse s potentials ) and our proposed potential . in all the figures , @xmath119=10ev and @xmath126=@xmath141 .",
    "we do not consider the mixing ratios of the alloys and so our figures 3 to 9 do not have any specific molecular formula .",
    "tables 1 , 2 and 3 show more comparison between this paper and the literature on the results of simulations carried out on other sampled materials .",
    "figures 9 and 10 are the plots of phase shift in the perturbed molecular dynamics of the materials considered . they show that all materials have frequently changing ( perturbed ) molecular dynamics as it experiences surface bombardments . in figure 10 , the two plots suggest , using our study of the perturbation of the molecular dynamics in materials as , a ( probable ) reason why gold does not rust as easily as iron .",
    "it our conclusion that it is best if these small perturbations are not ignore so as to fine tune and accurately channel the energy delivery mechanisms . this will be undoubtedly required in medical applications where cross - organ energy transport is undesirable .",
    "furthermore , going by our results obtained , we have clearly shown that the md perturbations in a material , via its surface , is peculiar to the surface .",
