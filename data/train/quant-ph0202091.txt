    "the use of symmetry to enhance our understanding of physical systems is well - known . an important manifestation of this simplification is nther s theorem , which guarantees the correspondence between symmetries and conservation laws.@xmath1 examples of the consequences of this theorem include    * translation invariance @xmath2 momentum conservation ; * time translation invariance @xmath2 energy conservation ; * rotational invariance @xmath2 angular momentum conservation .",
    "these particular symmetries and conservation laws are exact .",
    "far more common are cases for which the invariance is only approximate and is broken in some fashion . nevertheless , the symmetry still represents a useful way of analyzing the system , and it is important to understand the mechanisms by which this symmetry breaking can take place . despite the many physical situations involving symmetry violation , there exist just three mechanisms by which this violation can take place :    * explicit symmetry breaking , wherein the breaking occurs explicitly in the lagrangian .",
    "familiar examples include particle physics , where the heavier mass of the strange quark compared to its up , down counterparts violates the underlying su(3 ) invariance;@xmath3 nuclear physics , where the up - down quark mass difference together with electromagnetic effects are responsible for small deviations from isotopic spin invariance;@xmath4 gravitational physics , where general relativity together with small perturbations from the outer planets lead to deviations from the underlying o(4 ) invariance associated with a pure @xmath5 interaction and hence to the precession of mercury s perihelion.@xmath6 * spontaneous ( or hidden ) symmetry breaking , wherein the lagrangian remains invariant , but the symmetry is not present in the ground state .",
    "familiar examples include condensed matter physics , where the spontaneous violation of rotational invariance by the creation of spin - correlated domains in materials such as iron leads to the phenomenon of ferromagnetism,@xmath7 and the spontaneous violation of local gauge invariance by the condensation of spin- and momentum - correlated electron pairs in low temperature systems leads to superconductivity;@xmath8 classical physics , where ( as first studied by jacobi ) the rapid rotation of a gravitationally bound sphere leads to a lowest energy state not possessing the expected axial invariance.@xmath9 * anomalous ( or quantum mechanical ) symmetry breaking , wherein the symmetry is present at the classical level , but is broken by quantization.@xmath10 examples include elementary particle physics , where the two photon decay of the neutral pion verifies the anomalous breaking of axial su(2 ) invariance,@xmath11 and in elementary particle physics , where the so - called trace anomaly leads to a substantial component of the nucleon mass being due to its gluon substructure.@xmath11    although these manifestations of explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking are textbook examples and are well known and available to most physicists , the realization of anomalous symmetry breaking is generally presented only within the context of quantum field theory and is subsequently somewhat inaccessible to all but the experts .",
    "yet this inaccessibility need not be the case . indeed in previous contributions to this journal , it has been shown that the anomaly is manifested in ordinary quantum mechanics in two spatial dimensions with a delta function interaction.@xmath12 however , this example is not realized in nature . in this note",
    "we point out that an additional example of anomalous symmetry breaking occurs in the real world of three spatial dimensions in the presence of a @xmath0 potential and that the resultant predictions have been experimentally verified in atomic physics .",
    "the discussion is at the level appropriate for a graduate quantum mechanics course .    after a brief review of the previously mentioned two - dimensional delta function potential ,",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : anomalies ] how the @xmath0 interaction can be analyzed using either cutoff regularization in both the bound state and scattering regimes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : apply ] we demonstrate how this situation can be realized experimentally and discuss the confrontation of theory with recent experiments .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "to understand how an anomaly is realized in quantum mechanics , we first review the partial wave formalism , in which the solution to the time - independent schrdinger equation is expanded in legendre polynomials @xmath13 the radial functions @xmath14 obey the differential equation ( henceforth we employ @xmath15 ) @xmath16r_\\ell(r)=er_\\ell(r)\\,\\,.\\label{eq : sch}\\ ] ]      for a free particle , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and we have the plane wave solution @xmath19 that is , @xmath20 in the notation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jl ] ) . by using the asymptotic behavior @xmath21 we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : pla ] ) in the form @xmath22 equation  ( [ eq : plane ] ) is a linear combination of incoming , @xmath23 , and outgoing , @xmath24 , spherical waves with a phase shift @xmath25 between them in the channel having angular momentum @xmath26 , due to the centrifugal potential term , @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch ] ) .",
    "the existence of this _ energy - independent _ phase between incoming and outgoing spherical wave components can be understood from the invariance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch ] ) under the scale transformation @xmath28 , which requires that the solution be a function of the product @xmath29 , which is scale invariant.@xmath30 this condition is obviously satisfied by the spherical bessel functions @xmath31 , and would be violated by the existence of an energy - dependent phase .    in the presence of a potential ,",
    "the asymptotic form of the scattering solutions to the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\ { } & & = e^{ikz}+{e^{ikr}\\over r}f(\\theta)\\,\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the scattering amplitude , and @xmath34 is the scattering phase shift introduced by the potential . because the presence of the potential breaks the scale invariance , the appearance of an energy - dependent phase is permitted .",
    "now consider what happens in two spatial dimensions , for which the asymptotic form of the scattering solution is@xmath36 @xmath37 with @xmath38 in this case if we include the potential energy @xmath39 the scale invariance is maintained  indeed , at the classical level , there is no scattering because no particles are deflected .",
    "however , the absence of scattering no longer holds once the theory is quantized .",
    "actually this anomalous behavior should be expected because of the wave - like nature of the particles  an incident beam even with zero impact parameter can sense the presence of the potential spike at @xmath40 .",
    "of course , this scattering will occur only in the @xmath41 channel , because wavefunctions with @xmath42 must vanish at the origin .    to see how the scattering arises",
    ", we examine a scattering solution . in momentum space",
    "the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fourier transform of the scattering wavefunction .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc ] ) is @xmath45 for consistency , we require , @xmath46 where we have regulated the otherwise divergent momentum space integration by introducing a cutoff parameter @xmath47 . then @xmath48 we can obtain the scattering amplitude by taking the inverse fourier transform and find @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the two - dimensional green s function . if we compare eq .",

    "( [ eq : asy ] ) , we identify the scattering amplitude as @xmath51 to eliminate the dependence on the cutoff , we note that the scattering amplitude has a pole at @xmath52 indicating the presence of a ( single ) bound state . using this binding energy as a parameter",
    ", we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : scat ] ) as @xmath53 which is now expressed only in terms of experimental quantities .",
    "equivalently , we can characterize the scattering amplitude in terms of a phase shift @xmath54 or in terms of the differential scattering cross section @xmath55 the existence of this energy dependent phase in the @xmath41 channel or of the fixed energy bound state is clear evidence of anomalous symmetry breaking .",
    "the manifestation of anomalous symmetry breaking in quantum mechanics for the two - dimensional delta function interaction has been explored previously@xmath12 and was reviewed to set the context for our primary topic  the @xmath0 potential .",
    "as we shall see , there is an anomaly in this case also , and although there are similarities to the @xmath35 case , there are also important differences , one of which is the fact that there are experimental consequences .",
    "consider the potential @xmath56 in three spatial dimensions . we define the partial wave amplitude @xmath57 and find @xmath58r_\\ell(r)=0 \\,,\\ ] ] so that invariance under the scale transformation @xmath59 again holds .",
    "it is clear that the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch1 ] ) can be written in terms of bessel functions @xmath60 where we have defined @xmath61 because @xmath62 is defined via a quadratic equation , it is apparent that the character of the solutions must change when the discriminant @xmath63 becomes negative . for repulsive interactions , @xmath64",
    ", there is nothing unusual . in general , the orders of the bessel functions become irrational , but the problem can be solved as usual . because the wavefunction must be regular at the origin , we must have @xmath65 and the scattering phase shift can be read off as @xmath66 because @xmath67 is independent of @xmath68 , this result is consistent with the expected scale invariance .",
    "now consider the case of an attractive potential , @xmath69 as long as the discriminant is positive , things go through as before .",
    "however , once @xmath70 , the potential has overcome the centrifugal barrier , and the order @xmath62 of the bessel function becomes imaginary.@xmath71 first consider the case of a bound state , in which case the boundary condition as @xmath72 demands that the solution be constructed in terms of the bessel function @xmath73 , where we have defined @xmath74 and the binding energy as @xmath75 the asymptotic behavior is then @xmath76 the allowed values of @xmath77 ( and thereby of the binding energy ) are determined by the boundary condition that the wavefunction vanish at the origin . from the behavior @xmath78\\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] where arg indicates the phase of the following complex number , we see that the wavefunction goes through infinitely many zeroes as @xmath79 . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectrum becomes continuous and unbounded from below , implying that , despite its appearance , the hamiltonian is not self - adjoint .",
    "similarly , the phase shift of the scattering wavefunction as @xmath79 is undetermined .    one mathematically attractive solution to these problems is to define a so - called self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian by specifying a particular boundary condition at @xmath80.@xmath36 for example , each member of the continuum of self - adjoint extensions of this hamiltonian can be characterized by the ( energy - independent ) scattering phase shift as @xmath79.@xmath81 we briefly discuss self - adjoint extensions in the applications of the @xmath0 potential , but this regularization method does not directly illustrate anomalous symmetry breaking .",
    "we instead opt for an alternative route and introduce a short distance cutoff @xmath82 and demand that the wavefunction vanish at this point , @xmath83 , and that the physics be independent of the choice of cutoff parameter.@xmath71 this prescription yields the points @xmath84-n\\pi\\over \\xi_\\ell}\\bigr ) \\,.\\ ] ] in order that @xmath85 , we require @xmath86 and , because @xmath87=-\\gamma\\xi_\\ell+{\\cal o}(\\xi_\\ell)^2 $ ] , the energy becomes @xmath88 in order that the ground state ( @xmath89 ) energy remains finite and well - defined as @xmath90 , we require @xmath91 , which demands the scaling behavior @xmath92 this relation does not predict the value of @xmath77 , but rather defines the scaling of @xmath93 as @xmath90 in terms of the _ experimental _ value of @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding ground state wavefunction is @xmath95 the very existence of a bound state implies the presence of an energy scale and the breaking of scale invariance as a result of quantization , just as in the case of the two - dimensional delta function  a quantum mechanical example of an anomaly !",
    "another similarity with the two - dimensional delta function potential is that there is but a single bound state .",
    "this similarity can be seen from the fact that because @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the discriminant in any but the @xmath98-wave channel must be positive so that no anomaly ( and no bound state ) can occur .",
    "similarly in the @xmath99 case but with @xmath100 , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) that such states can not have nonzero binding energies , because @xmath101 we summarize this discussion with the observation that from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis ] ) and the following , there exists a critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath102 , below which there exists a single bound state and above which there are no bound states",
    ".    we can also consider scattering in the presence of an anomaly .",
    "in this case the solutions of the partial wave equation must be linear combinations of @xmath103 and @xmath104 : @xmath105 from the asymptotic dependence @xmath106 then for the @xmath98-wave channel in which @xmath107 , we identify the scattering phase shift via @xmath108 on the other hand , for small values of @xmath109 , we find @xmath110 the requirement that @xmath111 yields @xmath112 where we have defined @xmath113 if we compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fund ] ) , we can identify @xmath114 in the limit that @xmath115 , we have then @xmath116 using the scaling behavior @xmath117 we find that @xmath118 which yields the partial wave amplitude @xmath119 as a check we verify that that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol ] ) has a pole at the bound state energy @xmath120 .    because @xmath121 we see that there is no anomaly in the non-@xmath98 wave states so that the scattering phase shift is given by its non - anomalous value given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : non ] ) .",
    "the form of the scattering amplitude is @xmath122 where @xmath67 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : non ] ) .      before proceeding to applications of this formalism , it is interesting ( but unrelated to considerations of the anomaly ) that there is another curious feature of the @xmath0 interaction , as previously pointed out by kayser.@xmath123 if one solves for the classical scattering angle for motion in the presence of such a potential , the result is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the angular momentum .",
    "taking the interaction to be repulsive ( @xmath64 ) and solving for the cross section , we find @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the incoming momentum , and we have defined @xmath128 .",
    "thus the cross section is _ linear _ in the coupling constant , in apparent violation of the simple born approximation result when the potential becomes weak . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown that the same cross section results from a quantum mechanical evaluation .",
    "the resolution of the apparent paradox lies in the fact that the classical scattering condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cl ] ) can be satisfied only when @xmath129 .",
    "this condition can be seen from the result @xmath130 which implies that @xmath131 thus the classical result corresponds to the strong coupling regime , where the born approximation is not appropriate .",
    "a remarkable feature of the above analysis of the @xmath0 potential is that this interaction is realized in nature .",
    "as has recently been emphasized , one such application is to that of a charge interacting with a point dipole.@xmath132 because the potential outside an electric dipole @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 the potential energy for a charge @xmath135 in the vicinity is given by @xmath136 which has the desired @xmath0-dependence .",
    "point dipoles are not physical , but a good approximation is provided by a polar molecule such as water and the point charge can be taken to be a nearby electron . to analyze this system by means of the formalism developed in sec .  2 , we write the bound state solution as in ref.@xcite : @xmath137 then the equations determining the radial and angular dependence are given by @xmath138 and the separation constant @xmath139",
    "is related to the actual coupling @xmath140 of the point - dipole potential by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eig ] ) .",
    "if we use the normalized legendre polynomials @xmath141 as a basis , eq .  ( [ eqn : eig]b ) can be written as a matrix equation @xmath142 with @xmath143 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eq : matrix ] ) is an eigenvalue equation , for which the existence of a solution requires that @xmath144 equation  ( [ eq : sol ] ) can be easily solved numerically by successively evaluating the @xmath145 determinant , which converges extremely rapidly : @xmath146 from our study of the @xmath0 potential in sec .",
    "[ sec : r2 ] , we know that there exists a critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath102 , below which there exists a bound state and above which there does not . hence from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dip ] ) , we observe that there must exist a critical value of the dipole moment @xmath147 , defined via @xmath148 such that a bound electron - polar molecule state , an anion , can ( can not ) exist for values of the dipole moment larger ( smaller ) than this critical value . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ite ] ) , we find @xmath149 , that is , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the bohr radius .",
    "this prediction can be checked experimentally , and studies have been conducted attempting to measure the binding energies of anion systems.@xmath152 it has indeed been found that a minimum dipole moment exists , as shown in fig .  1 ; there does seem to exist a minimum dipole moment @xmath153 , as would be expected from the above considerations .",
    "note that there is a bit of a subtlety here in that a real molecule is _ not _ a point dipole .",
    "rather the potential for a finite dipole can be written as @xmath154 which is the superposition of a pure point dipole interaction with a scale symmetry - breaking interaction @xmath155 . because experimentally such an explicitly symmetry breaking term can not be eliminated , the observed critical moment is due to a combination of the anomalous and explicit symmetry breaking effects .",
    "it is clear that the presence of explicit breaking does not affect the existence of a critical moment , as expected from the quantum mechanical anomaly .",
    "however , the size of @xmath156 _ is _ affected , as can be seen from the comparison of experimental and theoretical sizes of the critical moment .",
    "this difference is perhaps not surprising , because in qcd , the combination of explicit and anomalous symmetry breaking results in a value for the @xmath157 decay rate very near that predicted by the anomaly.@xmath11    it is interesting that a second application of the @xmath0 potential has recently been discussed . in this case",
    "it involves the interpretation of an experiment involving the interaction of a neutral but polarizable atom with a charged wire.@xmath158 because the electric field generated by the wire falls off linearly with distance , the induced electric dipole moment has the form @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the electric polarizability .",
    "the corresponding interaction potential is @xmath161 and falls off as @xmath0 .",
    "the issue here is not the experimental appearance of a critical value of the coupling constant because the attractive @xmath0 potential is always critical in this cylindrical _ two - dimensional _",
    "problem,@xmath71 no matter what the strength of the electric field produced by the charged wire .",
    "the intriguing aspect of this experiment is that the atoms are observed to disappear from the system with an absorption cross section which can be fitted by a classical argument.@xmath158 an analogous treatment of the two - dimensional @xmath0 potential , regularized and renormalized as done here , would have only bound state and elastic scattering solutions , and no absorption .",
    "bawin and coon utilized a method suggested by radin@xmath162 to sum over the infinite number of elastic scattering solutions of the self - adjoint extensions of the @xmath0 interaction to obtain a quantum mechanical expression that displayed absorption.@xmath163 as the parameters of this initial experiment corresponded to the classical limit established by kayser,@xmath123 the classical limit of their quantum mechanical treatment recovered the experimental situation .",
    "however , further discussion is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the phenomenon of symmetry breaking is universal in physics , but although explicit and spontaneous violations are well - known and are generally treated in introductory courses , the same can not be said of quantum mechanical or anomalous symmetry breaking , where a symmetry is valid at the classical level but is violated due to quantization of the theory .",
    "this omission is presumably due to the fact that most familiar manifestations of the anomaly , for example , the two - photon decay of the neutral pion , occur in the context of quantum field theory and belong in the realm of elementary particle physics .",
    "however , this need not be the case .",
    "we have argued here that one can present this subject within the realm of ordinary quantum mechanics by studying the violation of scale symmetry , @xmath164 , @xmath165 . in earlier papers in this journal ,",
    "the case of a two - dimensional delta function was examined.@xmath12 however , this case is purely an intellectual exercise and has no experimental consequences . in this paper , we have examined the @xmath0 potential , which is anomalous and which _ does _ have experimental ramifications in the existence of a critical dipole moment allowing the binding of anions in atomic physics@xmath152 and in the recent study of the interaction of a polarizable atom with a charged wire.@xmath158    finally , it has long been known that the main features of the quantum mechanical three - body bound state and some striking aspects of nuclear three - body scattering are due to an effective @xmath0 potential , built from the relative distances between the particles , including mass factors where appropriate.@xmath166 this effective potential is displayed most clearly in recent effective field theory discussions of three - body systems , where it also exhibits scale invariance violation,@xmath167 but this discussion is clearly beyond the level of our paper . in any case",
    "we believe that the above discussion is at a level that is appropriate in an advanced quantum mechanics course , and it is hoped that paper note will encourage the introduction of this fascinating topic into such a venue .",
