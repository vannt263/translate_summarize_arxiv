    "_ rough estimate of @xmath39 in several cdw materials . _",
    "since @xmath169 is such an important parameter it is worthwhile making a very rough estimate of its value in various materials .",
    "it turns out that most materials lie outside the regime of validity of the lowest - level approximation , discussed in the appendix .    the longitudinal coherence length given by ( [ br1 ] )",
    "can be used to estimate @xmath39 .",
    "equation ( [ an1 ] ) and the lowest - level approximation , ( [ au1 ] ) , can be used to provide a rough estimate of @xmath77 , @xmath170 where @xmath58 is the single chain coherence length given by ( [ acd1 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath39 is roughly given by @xmath171 @xmath172 can be estimated from x - ray and neutron scattering experiments ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "deriving an accurate value of @xmath58 from microscopic theory is a subtle matter which will not be discussed here . for purposes of this paper",

    "table [ table1 ] lists estimates of @xmath172 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 for several materials that undergo a three - dimensional cdw ordering transition .",
    "these values are used in equation ( [ bw1 ] ) to give an order of magnitude estimate for @xmath39 in each material . in all the materials",
    "@xmath47 suggesting that the lowest - level approximation will give poor results .",
    "given the experimental uncertainty in the parameters discussed above it is hoped that this discussion will generate more precise studies of this question .",
    "the main points of this paper are the following .",
    "( 1 ) to derive a reliable ginzburg - landau functional to describe three - dimensional ordering transitions in quasi - one - dimensional materials one must give a careful treatment of the large intrachain order - parameter fluctuations .",
    "( 2 ) most physical properties are determined by a _ single _",
    "dimensionless parameter @xmath39 , defined in equation ( [ aat1 ] ) , which is a measure of the size of the intrachain fluctuations .",
    "( 3 ) commonly studied charge - density - wave materials lie outside the regime of the lowest - level approximation and so their accurate description requires an _ exact _ treatment of the intrachain fluctuations .",
    "( 4 ) if the single chain ginzburg - landau coefficients are assumed to be temperature independent then the width of the three - dimensional critical region , estimated by the ginzburg criterion , is virtually independent of any parameters , @xmath167 .",
    "this paper leaves a number of open questions and opportunities for future work .",
    "( a ) it needs to be established whether the temperature dependence of the single chain ginzburg - landau coefficients @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is important in realistic microscopic models .",
    "if so how are the results of figures [ fig3a ] , [ fig3 ] , and [ fig4 ] modified ?",
    "( b ) quantitative comparison of the results here with measurable quantities such as the specific heat jump and longitudinal coherence length requires values of the single chain coherence length @xmath58 from microscopic theory .",
    "( c ) for moderate interchain coupling the specific heat jump is given by @xmath176 , independent of the strength of the interchain coupling .",
    "is there a simple physical argument that can justify this simple result ?",
    "( d ) this paper treats the intrachain fluctuations exactly and the interchain interactions in the mean - field approximation .",
    "this neglect of the interchain fluctuations is presumably reasonable if the system is sufficiently anisotropic .",
    "it is desirable to have a quantitative criterion that defines the validity of this treatment .",
    "furthermore , presumably when the interchain interactions become sufficiently strong the system is better described by an anisotropic xy model in which the fluctuations in all three directions are treated on an equal footing .",
    "it would be nice to have a description of the crossover from a transition at @xmath177 ( ensured by the criterion ( [ bhy1 ] ) ) to the case @xmath178 for strong interchain coupling .",
    "it is not clear how to attack this problem within any particular approximation scheme .",
    "it may be necessary to use a numerically intensive technique such as series expansions or a monte carlo simulation .",
    "hopefully this paper will stimulate such a study .",
