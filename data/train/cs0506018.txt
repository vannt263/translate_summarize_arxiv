    "recently , there has been a growing interest in the design and analysis of wireless cooperative transmission protocols ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "these works consider several interesting scenarios ( e.g. , fading - vs - awgn channels , ergodic - vs - quasistatic channels , and full - duplex - vs - half - duplex transmission ) and devise appropriate transmission techniques and analysis tools , based on the settings . here",
    ", we focus on the delay - limited coherent channel and adopt the same setup as considered by laneman , tse , and wornell in @xcite .",
    "there , the authors imposed the half - duplex constraint ( either transmit or receive , but not both ) on the cooperating nodes and proposed several cooperative transmission protocols . in this setup , the basic idea is to leverage the antennas available at the other nodes in the network as a source of _ virtual _ spatial diversity .",
    "the proposed protocols in @xcite were classified as either amplify and forward ( af ) , where the helping node retransmits a scaled version of its soft observation , or decode and forward ( df ) , where the helping node attempts first to decode the information stream and then re - encodes it using ( a possibly different ) code - book .",
    "all the proposed schemes in @xcite used a time division multiple access ( tdma ) strategy , where the two partners relied on the use of orthogonal subspaces to repeat each other s signals .",
    "later , laneman and wornell extended their df strategy to the @xmath0 partners scenario @xcite .",
    "other follow - up works have focused on developing practical coding schemes that attempt to exploit the promised information theoretic gains ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as observed in @xcite , previously proposed cooperation protocols suffer from a significant loss of performance in high spectral efficiency scenarios .",
    "in fact , the authors of @xcite posed the following open problem : _",
    "`` a key area of further research is exploring cooperative diversity protocols in the high spectral efficiency regime . ''",
    "_ this remark motivates our work here , where we present more efficient ( and in some cases optimal ) af and df protocols for the relay , cooperative broadcast ( cb ) , and cooperative multiple - access ( cma ) channels . to establish the gain offered by the proposed protocols , we adopt the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff as our measure of performance .",
    "this powerful tool was introduced by zheng and tse for point - to - point multi - input - multi - output ( mimo ) channels in @xcite and later used by tse , viswanath , and zheng to study the ( non - cooperative ) multiple - access channel in @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we summarize the main results of this paper , some of which were initially reported in @xcite .    1 .   for the single relay channel ,",
    "we establish an upper bound on the achievable diversity - multiplexing tradeoff by the class of af protocols .",
    "we then identify a variant within this class , referred to as the nonorthogonal amplify and forward ( naf ) protocol , that achieves this upper bound .",
    "we then propose a dynamic decode and forward ( ddf ) protocol and show that it achieves the _ optimal _ tradeoff for multiplexing gains @xmath3 '' will be defined rigorously in the sequel ] .",
    "furthermore , the ddf protocol is shown to outperform all af protocols for arbitrary multiplexing gains .",
    "finally , the two protocols ( i.e. , naf and ddf ) are extended to the scenario with @xmath1 relays where we characterize their tradeoff curves .",
    "notably , the naf protocol is shown to outperform the space - time coded protocol of laneman and wornell ( lw - stc ) @xcite without requiring decoding / encoding at the relays .",
    "2 .   for the cooperative broadcast channel",
    ", we present a modified version of the ddf protocol to allow for reliable transmission of the common information .",
    "we then characterize the tradeoff curve of this protocol and use this characterization to establish its superiority compared to af protocols .",
    "in fact , we argue that the gain offered by the ddf is more significant in this scenario ( as compared to the relay channel ) .",
    "3 .   for the symmetric multiple - access scenario",
    ", we propose a novel af cooperative protocol where an _ artificial _ inter - symbol - interference ( isi ) channel is created .",
    "we prove the optimality ( in the sense of diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ) of this protocol by showing that , for all multiplexing gains ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) , it achieves the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff of the corresponding @xmath5 point - to - point channel .",
    "one can then use this result to argue that the sub - optimality of the schemes proposed in @xcite was dictated by the use of orthogonal subspaces rather than the half - duplex constraint .",
    "we also utilize this result to shed more light on the fundamental difference between half - duplex relay and cooperative multiple - access channels .    before proceeding further , a brief remark regarding two independent parallel works @xcite is in order . in @xcite , nabar , bolcskei and",
    "kneubuhler considered the half - duplex single - relay channel , under _ almost _ the same assumptions as in @xcite ( i.e. , the only difference is that , for diversity analysis , the relay - destination channel was assumed to be non - fading ) and proposed a set of af and df protocols . in one of their af protocols ( nbk - af ) , nabar _ et .",
    "_ allowed the source to continue transmission over the whole duration of the codeword , while the relay listened to the source for the first half of the codeword and relayed the received signal over the second half .",
    "this makes the nbk - af protocol identical to the naf protocol proposed in this paper . here",
    ", we characterize the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by this protocol while relaxing the assumption of non - fading relay - destination channel . using this analysis",
    ", we establish the optimality of this scheme within the class of linear af protocols .",
    "furthermore , we generalize the naf protocol to the case of arbitrary number of relays and characterize its achieved tradeoff curve . in @xcite , prasad and",
    "varanasi derived upper bounds on the diversity - multiplexing tradeoffs achieved by the df protocols proposed in @xcite . in the sequel",
    ", we establish the gain offered by the proposed ddf protocol by comparing its diversity - multiplexing tradeoff with the upper bounds in @xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize that , except for the single - relay naf protocol , all the other protocols proposed in this paper are novel .    in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath6 to mean @xmath7 , @xmath8 to mean @xmath9 and @xmath10 to mean nearest integer to @xmath11 towards plus infinity . @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the set of real and complex @xmath0-tuples , respectively , while @xmath14 denotes the set of non - negative @xmath0-tuples .",
    "we denote the complement of set @xmath15 , in @xmath12 , by @xmath16 , while @xmath17 means @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the @xmath20 identity matrix , @xmath21 denotes the autocovariance matrix of vector @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denotes the base-@xmath24 logarithm .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ back ] , we detail our modeling assumptions and review , briefly , some results that will be extensively used in the sequel .",
    "the half - duplex relay channel is investigated in section  [ relay ] where we describe the naf and ddf protocols and derive their tradeoff curves . in section  [ broad ] , we extend the ddf protocol to the cooperative broadcast channel .",
    "section  [ mac ] is devoted to the cooperative multiple - access channel where we propose a new af protocol and establish its optimality , in the symmetric scenario , with respect to the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff . in section  [ num ] , we present numerical results that show the snr gains offered by the proposed schemes in certain representative scenarios .",
    "finally , we offer some concluding remarks in section  [ conc ] . to enhance the flow of the paper , we collect all the proofs in the appendix .",
    "first we state the general assumptions that apply to the three scenarios considered in this paper ( i.e. , relay , broadcast , and multiple - access ) . assumptions pertaining to a specific scenario will be given in the related section .    1 .   all channels are assumed to be flat rayleigh - fading and quasi - static , i.e. , the channel gains remain constant during a coherence - interval and change independently from one coherence - interval to another .",
    "furthermore , the channel gains are mutually independent with unit variance . the additive noises at different nodes are zero - mean , mutually - independent , circularly - symmetric and white complex - gaussian . furthermore , the variances of these noises are proportional to one another such that there will always be _ fixed _ offsets between the different channels signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "all nodes have the same power constraint , have a single antenna , and operate synchronously .",
    "only the receiving node of any link knows the channel gain ; no feedback to the transmitting node is permitted ( the incremental relaying protocol proposed in @xcite can not , therefore , be considered in our framework ) .",
    "following in the footsteps of @xcite , all cooperating partners operate in the half - duplex mode , i.e. , at any point in time , a node can either transmit or receive , but not both .",
    "this constraint is motivated by , e.g. , the typically large difference between the incoming and outgoing signal power levels .",
    "though this half - duplex constraint is quite restrictive to protocol development , it is nevertheless assumed throughout the paper .",
    "3 .   throughout the paper , we assume the use of random gaussian code - books where a codeword spans the entire coherence - interval of the channel . furthermore , we assume asymptotically large code - lengthes .",
    "this implies that the diversity - multiplexing tradeoffs derived in this paper , serve as upper - bounds for the performance of the proposed protocols with finite code - lengths .",
    "results related to the design of practical coding / decoding schemes that approach the fundamental limits established here will be reported elsewhere .",
    "next we summarize several important definitions and results that will be used throughout the paper .    1 .",
    "the snr of a link , @xmath25 , is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the average energy available for transmission of a symbol across the link and @xmath28 denotes the variance of the noise observed at the receiving end of the link .",
    "we say that @xmath29 is _ exponentially equal to _ @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 , when @xmath32 in , @xmath33 is called the _ exponential order _ of @xmath29 . @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "are defined similarly .",
    "2 .   consider a family of codes @xmath36 indexed by operating snr @xmath25 , such that the code @xmath37 has a rate of @xmath38 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) and a maximum likelihood ( ml ) error probability @xmath39 .",
    "for this family , the _ multiplexing gain _",
    "`` @xmath40 '' and the _ diversity gain _",
    "`` @xmath41 '' are defined as @xmath42 3 .",
    "the problem of characterizing the optimal tradeoff between the reliability and throughput of a point - to - point communication system over a coherent quasi - static flat rayleigh - fading channel was posed and solved by zheng and tse in @xcite . for a mimo communication system with @xmath43 transmit and @xmath0",
    "receive antennas , they showed that , for any @xmath44 , the optimal diversity gain @xmath45 is given by the piecewise linear function joining the @xmath46 pairs @xmath47 for @xmath48 , provided that the code - length @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 .",
    "we say that protocol @xmath51 _ uniformly dominates _",
    "protocol @xmath52 if , for any multiplexing gain @xmath40 , @xmath53 . 5 .",
    "assume that @xmath54 is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "if @xmath55 denotes the exponential order of @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 then the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath55 can be shown to be : @xmath58 careful examination of the previous expression reveals that @xmath59 thus , for independent random variables @xmath60 distributed identically to @xmath55 , the probability @xmath61 that @xmath62 belongs to set @xmath63 can be characterized by @xmath64 provided that @xmath17 is not empty . in other words ,",
    "the exponential order of @xmath61 only depends on @xmath17 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the probability of any set , consisting of @xmath0-tuples @xmath65 with at least one negative element , decreases exponentially with snr and therefore can be neglected compared to @xmath66 which decreases polynomially with snr .",
    "consider a coherent linear gaussian channel where a random gaussian code - book is used .",
    "the pairwise error probability ( pep ) of the ml decoder , denoted as @xmath67 , averaged over the ensemble of random gaussian codes , is upper bounded by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the signal and noise components of the observed vector , respectively ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) .",
    "in this section , we consider the relay scenario in which @xmath1 relays help a single source to better transmit its message to the destination . as",
    "the vague descriptions `` help '' and `` better transmit '' suggest , the general relay problem is rather broad and only certain sub - problems have been studied ( for example see @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we focus on two important classes of relay protocols .",
    "the first is the class of amplify and forward ( af ) protocols , where a relaying node can only process the observed signal linearly before re - transmitting it .",
    "the second is the class of decode and forward ( df ) protocols , where the relays are allowed to decode and re - encode the message using ( a possibly different ) code - book . here",
    "we emphasize that , a priori , it is not clear which class ( i.e. , af or df ) offers a better performance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we first consider the single relay scenario ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) .",
    "for this scenario , we derive the optimal diversity - multiplexing tradeoff and identify a specific protocol within this class , i.e. , the naf protocol , that achieves this optimal tradeoff .",
    "we then extend the naf protocol to the general case with an arbitrary number of relays .    under the half - duplex constraint",
    ", it is easy to see that any single - relay af protocol can be mathematically described by some choice of the matrices @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath52 in the following model @xmath75 in , @xmath76 represents the vector of observations at the destination , @xmath77 the vector of source symbols , @xmath78 the vector of noise samples ( of variance @xmath79 ) observed by the relay , and @xmath80 the vector of noise samples ( of variance @xmath28 ) observed by the destination . the variables @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote the source - relay channel gain , source - destination channel gain , and relay - destination channel gain , respectively . @xmath84 and @xmath85 are diagonal matrices .",
    "in this protocol , the source can potentially transmit a new symbol in every symbol - interval of the codeword , while the relay listens during the first @xmath86 symbols and then , for the remaining @xmath87 symbols , transmits linear combinations of the @xmath86 noisy observations using the coefficients in @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , by letting @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 denoting the relay repetition gain ) , we obtain laneman - tse - wornell amplify and forward ( ltw - af ) protocol @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that when the source symbols are independent , the average energy constraint translates to @xmath94 where @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 .",
    "[ thrm:1 ] the optimal diversity gain for the cooperative relay scenario with a single af relay is upper - bounded by @xmath97    please refer to the appendix .",
    "the upper - bound on @xmath45 , as given by , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_naf ] .",
    "having theorem  [ thrm:1 ] at hand , it now suffices to identify an af protocol that achieves this upper - bound in order to establish its optimality . towards this end , we observe that , in the proof of theorem  [ thrm:1 ] , the only requirements on @xmath52 such that the protocol described by could _ potentially _ achieve the optimal diversity - multiplexing tradeoff are for @xmath52 to be square ( of dimension @xmath98 ) and full - rank .",
    "furthermore , @xmath52 should not violate the relay average energy constraint as given by .",
    "thus , the simple choices @xmath99 inspire our naf protocol .",
    "in particular , the source transmits on every symbol - interval in a cooperation frame , where a cooperation frame is defined as two consecutive symbol - intervals .",
    "the relay , on the other hand , transmits only once per cooperation frame ; it simply repeats the ( noisy ) signal it observed during the previous symbol - interval .",
    "it is important to realize that this design is dictated by the half - duplex constraint , which implies that the relay can repeat at most once per cooperation frame .",
    "we denote the repetition gain by @xmath33 and , for frame @xmath100 , we denote the information symbols by @xmath101 .",
    "the signals received by the destination during frame @xmath100 are thus : @xmath102 where the repetition gain @xmath33 must satisfy .",
    "note that , in order to decode the message , the destination needs to know the relay repetition gain @xmath33 , the source - relay channel gain @xmath81 , the source - destination channel gain @xmath82 , and the relay - destination channel gain @xmath83 .",
    "now , we are ready to establish the optimality of the naf protocol with respect to the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff .",
    "[ thrm:2 ] the naf protocol achieves the optimal diversity - multiplexing tradeoff for the af single - relay scenario , which is : @xmath103    please refer to the appendix .",
    "three remarks are now in order :    1 .   as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_naf ] , the naf protocol enjoys uniform dominance over the direct transmission scheme ( i.e. , no cooperation ) and ltw - af protocol .",
    "this dominance can be attributed to relaxing the orthogonality constraint whereby one can reap two distinct benefits : rate enhancement via continuous transmission and diversity enhancement via cooperation .",
    "it is interesting to note that this dominance is achieved while only half of the symbols are repeated by the relay . 2 .   from fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_naf ] , one can see that for multiplexing gains greater that @xmath104 , the diversity gain achieved by the proposed naf relay protocol is identical to that of the non - cooperative protocol .",
    "this is due to the fact that the _ af cooperative _ link provided by the relay can not support multiplexing gains greater than @xmath104a consequence of the half - duplex constraint .",
    "hence , for multiplexing gains larger than @xmath104 , there is only one link from the source to the destination , and , thus , the tradeoff curve is identical to that of a point - to - point system with one transmit and one receive antenna .",
    "later , we will show that the proposed ddf strategy avoids this drawback .",
    "as shown in the proof of theorem  [ thrm:2 ] , the achievability of the optimal tradeoff is not very sensitive to the choice of the repetition gain `` @xmath33 '' ( i.e. , for a wide range of choices , the naf protocol achieves the optimal tradeoff ) . in practice",
    ", one should optimize the repetition gain , experimentally if needed , to minimize the outage probability at the target rate and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the naf protocol can be extended to the case of arbitrary number of relays ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) as follows .",
    "first , we define a super - frame as a concatenation of @xmath1 consecutive cooperation frames . within each super - frame , the relays take turns repeating the signals they previously observed as they did in the case of a single relay ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - relay_naf ] ) .",
    "thus , the destination s received signals during a super - frame will be @xmath106 where the source - relay channel gain , relay - destination channel gain , relay repetition gain , and relay - observed noise for relay @xmath107 are denoted by @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "as before , @xmath82 represents the source - destination channel gain .",
    "the quantities @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 represent the received signal , noise sample , and source symbol , respectively , during the @xmath115 symbol - interval of the @xmath116 cooperation frame .",
    "note that there is nothing to be gained by having more than one relay transmitting the same symbol simultaneously .",
    "also , similar to the single - relay naf scenario , the destination needs to know all relay repetition gains @xmath117 as well as all channel gains @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the following theorem characterizes the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by this protocol .",
    "[ thrm:3 ] the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by the naf protocol with @xmath1 relays is characterized by @xmath120    the proof is virtually identical to that of theorem  [ thrm:2 ] , and hence , is omitted for brevity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the generalized naf protocol uniformly dominates the lw - stc .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that in the generalized naf protocol , in contrast to the lw - stc protocol , the source transmits over the whole duration of the codeword .",
    "the generalized naf protocol offers the additional advantage of low complexity since it does not require decoding / encoding at the relays .      in this class of protocols , we allow for the possibility of decoding / encoding at the different relays . in @xcite ,",
    "laneman - tse - wornell presented a particular variant of df protocols ( ltw - df ) where the source transmits in the first half of the codeword .",
    "based on its received signal in this interval , the relay attempts to decode the message .",
    "it then re - encodes and transmits the encoded stream in the second half of the codeword . in @xcite , laneman and",
    "wornell derived the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by this scheme ( i.e. , @xmath121 ) , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_ddf_2 ] . here ,",
    "we propose a dynamic decode and forward ( ddf ) protocol and characterize its tradeoff curve .",
    "this characterization reveals the uniform dominance of this protocol over all known _ full - diversity _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath122 ) protocols proposed for the half - duplex single - relay channel and furthermore establishes its optimality , over a certain range of multiplexing gains ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) .",
    "we first describe and analyze the protocol for the case of a single relay .",
    "generalization to @xmath1 relays will then follow .",
    "similar to the previous section , we assume that a codeword consists of @xmath49 consecutive symbol - intervals , during which all the channel gains remain unchanged . in the ddf protocol ,",
    "the source transmits data at a rate of @xmath124 bpcu during every symbol - interval in the codeword .",
    "the relay , on the other hand , listens to the source until the mutual information between its received signal and source signal exceeds @xmath125 .",
    "it then decodes and re - encodes the message using an _ independent _ gaussian code - book and transmits it during the rest of the codeword .",
    "the dynamic nature of the protocol is manifested in the fact that we allow the relay to listen for a time duration that depends on the instantaneous channel realization to maximize the probability of successful decoding .",
    "we denote the signals transmitted by the source and relay as @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , where @xmath86 is the number of symbol - intervals the relay waits before starting transmission . using this notation , the received signals ( at the destination )",
    "can be written as : @xmath128 from the protocol description , it is clear that the number of symbols where the relay listens should be chosen as : @xmath129 where @xmath81 is the source - relay channel gain , and @xmath130 .",
    "one can now see the dependence of this choice of @xmath86 on the instantaneous channel realization and that this choice , together with the asymptotically large @xmath49 , guarantees that when @xmath131 , the relay average probability of error with a gaussian code ensemble is arbitrarily small ] . clearly , when @xmath132 the relay does not contribute to the transmission of the message , and hence , incorrect decoding at the relay in this case does not affect performance . here , we observe that , in contrast to the naf protocol , the destination does not need to know the source - relay channel gain .",
    "it does , however , need to know the relay waiting time @xmath86 , along , with the source - destination and relay - destination channel gains .",
    "the following theorem describes the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achievable with this cooperation protocol .",
    "[ thrm:4 ] the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by the single relay ddf protocol is given by @xmath133    please refer to the appendix .",
    "the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff of is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_ddf_2 ] .",
    "it is now clear that the ddf protocol is optimal for @xmath3 since it achieves the genie aided diversity ( where the relay is assumed to know the information message _ a - priori _ ) .",
    "for @xmath134 , the ddf protocol suffers from a loss , compared to the genie aided strategy , since , on the average , the relay will only be able to help during a small fraction of the codeword .",
    "it is easy to see that , the performance for this range of multiplexing gains can not be improved through employing a mixed af and df strategy .",
    "in fact , the ddf strategy dominates all such strategies .",
    "it remains to be seen whether there exists a strategy that closes the gap to the genie aided strategy when @xmath135 or not .",
    "note also that the gain offered by the ddf protocol , compared to af protocols , can be attributed to the ability of this strategy to transmit independent gaussian symbols after successful decoding . in af strategies , on the other hand ,",
    "the relay is limited to repeating the noisy gaussian symbols it receives from the source .",
    "[ fig : d_r_ddf_2 ] also compares the ddf protocol with the df protocol proposed in @xcite , which we refer to as nbk - df . in this comparison",
    ", we utilize the upper - bound derived by prasad and varanasi on the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff of the nbk - df , which was reported in @xcite .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_ddf_2 ] that the nbk - df protocol does not achieve any diversity gain greater than one .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that in this protocol , the message is split up into two parts , out of which , only one is retransmitted by the relay .",
    "[ fig : d_r_ddf_2 ] also shows that for multiplexing gains close to one , the nbk - df upper - bound outperforms the ddf protocol .",
    "therefore , in this range , the comparison between the two protocols depends on the tightness of the nbk - df upper - bound which was not discussed in @xcite .",
    "next , we describe the generalization of the ddf protocol to the case of multiple relays . in this case , the source and relays cooperate in nearly the same manner as in the single relay case .",
    "specifically , the source transmits during the whole codeword while each relay listens until the mutual information between its received signal and the signals transmitted by the source and other relays exceeds @xmath125 .",
    "it is assumed that every relay knows the code - books used by the source and other relays .",
    "once a relay decodes the message , it uses an independent code - book to re - encode the message , which it then transmits for the rest of the codeword .",
    "note that , since the source - relay channel gains may differ , the relays may require different wait times for decoding .",
    "this complicates the protocol , since a given relay s ability to decode the message requires precise knowledge of the times at which every other relay begins its transmission . to address this problem , the codeword is divided into a number of segments , and relays are allowed to start transmission only at the beginning of a segment . in between the segments , every relay is allowed to broadcast a ( well protected ) beacon , informing all other relays whether or not it will start transmission .",
    "judicious choice of the segment length , relative to the codeword length , results in only a small loss compared to the genie - aided case , whereby all relays know all decoding times _ a - priori_. here , we assume that the number of segments is sufficiently large and the length of the beacon signals is much smaller than the segment length . therefore , in characterizing the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by this protocol , we ignore the losses associated with the beacons and the quantization of the starting times for the different relays .",
    "[ thrm:5 ] the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by the ddf protocol with @xmath1 relays is characterized by : @xmath136    please refer to the appendix .",
    "the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_ddf_5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : d_r_ddf_diff ] for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "while the loss of the ddf protocol compared to the genie - aided protocol increases with @xmath0 , it is not clear at the moment if this loss is due to the half - duplex constraint or due to the sub - optimality of the ddf strategy .",
    "we now consider the cooperative broadcast ( cb ) scenario , where a single source broadcasts to @xmath0 destinations .",
    "the destinations cooperate through helping one another in receiving their messages .",
    "we assume that the source message for destination @xmath137 consists of two parts . a common part of rate @xmath138 bpcu , which is intended for all of the destinations and an individual part of rate @xmath139 bpcu , which is specific to the @xmath140 destination .",
    "the total rate is then @xmath141 and the multiplexing gain tuple is given by @xmath142 .",
    "we define the overall diversity gain @xmath41 based on the performance of the worst receiver as @xmath143 where we require all the receivers to decode the common information .",
    "now , as a first step , one can see that if @xmath144 , i.e. if there is no common message , then the techniques developed for the relay channel can be _ exported _ to this setting through a proportional time sharing strategy . with this assumption , all of the properties of the naf and ddf protocols , established for the relay channel , carry over to this scenario .",
    "the problem becomes slightly more challenging when @xmath145 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that , for a fixed total rate @xmath124 , the highest probability of error corresponds to the case where all destinations are required to decode all the messages .",
    "this translates to the following condition ( that applies to any cooperation scheme )    @xmath146    so , we will focus the following discussion on this worst case scenario , i.e. ,    @xmath147    the first observation is that , in this scenario , the only af strategy that achieves the full rate extreme point @xmath148 is the non - cooperative protocol .",
    "any other af strategy will require some of the nodes to re - transmit , and therefore not to _ listen _ during parts of the codeword , which prevents it from achieving full rate .",
    "fortunately , this drawback can be avoided in the ddf protocol .",
    "the reason is that , in this protocol , any node will start helping only after it has successfully decoded the message .",
    "we now propose a protocol for the cb scenario that is a direct extension of the ddf relay protocol .",
    "this will be referred to as the cb - ddf protocol in the sequel .",
    "the only modification needed , compared to the relay channel case , is that now every destination can act as a relay for the other destinations , based on its instantaneous channel gain .",
    "specifically , the source transmits during the whole codeword while each destination listens until the mutual information between its received signal and the signals transmitted by the source and other destinations exceeds @xmath125 .",
    "once a destination decodes the message , it uses an independent code - book to re - encode the message , which it then transmits for the rest of the codeword .",
    "similar to the relay channel , it is assumed that every destination knows the code - books used by the source and other destinations .",
    "also , the protocol must include a mechanism that keeps every destination informed of the re - transmission starting times of all the other destinations .",
    "again , in deriving the following result , we ignore the associated cost of this mechanism , relying on the asymptotic assumptions .",
    "[ thrm:6 ] the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff achieved by the cb - ddf protocol with @xmath0 destinations is given by : @xmath149    please refer to the appendix .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is exactly the same tradeoff obtained in the relay channel .",
    "this implies that requiring all nodes to decode the message does not entail a price in terms of the achievable tradeoff .",
    "in this section , we consider the cooperative multiple - access ( cma ) scenario , where @xmath0 sources transmit their independent messages to a common destination . we assume symmetry so that all sources transmit information at the same rate and are limited by the same power constraint .",
    "the basic idea of the proposed protocol , which we refer to as the cma - naf protocol , is to create an artificial isi channel . towards this end , each of the @xmath0 sources transmits once per cooperation frame , where a cooperation frame is defined as @xmath0 consecutive symbol - intervals ( refer to part a of fig .  [",
    "fig : cma_naf ] ) .",
    "each source is assigned unique _ transmission and reception _ symbol - intervals within the cooperation frame . during its transmission symbol - interval ,",
    "a source transmits a linear combination of its own symbol and the signal it observed during its most recent reception symbol - interval . in other words , every source , in addition to sending its own symbol , _ helps _ another source by repeating the ( noisy ) signal it last received from it . without loss of generality",
    ", we set the @xmath140 source transmission symbol - interval equal to @xmath150 .",
    "we now provide an illustrative example for the @xmath151 case . here",
    "we assume that sources @xmath152 , @xmath24 , and @xmath153 help sources @xmath153 , @xmath152 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "for the @xmath140 source and the @xmath154 cooperation frame , @xmath155 denotes the transmission , @xmath156 the ( assigned ) reception , and @xmath114 the originating symbol .",
    "using @xmath157 and @xmath158 to denote the broadcast and repetition gains of the @xmath140 source , respectively , the signals transmitted during the first two cooperation frames would be ( in chronological order ) @xmath159 using @xmath160 to denote the @xmath161-source - to-@xmath140-source channel gain , and @xmath162 to denote the noise observed by the @xmath140 source during its @xmath154-frame reception symbol - interval , the assigned receptions become @xmath163 using @xmath164 to denote the @xmath140-source - to - destination channel gain , and @xmath113 to denote the noise observed by the destination during the @xmath140 symbol - interval of the @xmath154 frame , the signals observed at the destination would be @xmath165 the source - observed noises @xmath166 have variance @xmath79 for all @xmath167 , and the destination - observed noises @xmath168 have variance @xmath28 for all @xmath167 .",
    "note that , as mandated by our half - duplex constraint , no source transmits and receives simultaneously .",
    "the broadcast and repetition gains @xmath169 should be chosen to satisfy the average power constraint @xmath170    let us now define @xmath171 consecutive cooperation frames as a super - frame ( refer to part b of fig .",
    "[ fig : cma_naf ] ) .",
    "we will assume that helper assignments are fixed within a super - frame but are scheduled to change across super - frames .",
    "we impose the following requirements on helper scheduling .    1 .   in each super - frame",
    ", every source is helped by a different source .",
    "2 .   across super - frames ,",
    "every source is helped equally by every other source .    among the many scheduling rules that satisfy these requirements , we choose the following circular rule . in super - frame @xmath172 ,",
    "sources with indices @xmath173 are assigned helpers with indices given by the @xmath140 right circular shift of @xmath173 , where @xmath174 .",
    "for example , when @xmath175 , the helper configurations are given by the following table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" ,",
    "]     since this scheduling algorithm generates @xmath1 distinct helper configurations , the length of the super - frames , @xmath171 , is chosen such that a coherence - interval consists of @xmath1 consecutive super - frames ( refer to part c of fig .

    ", it is required that all codewords span the entire coherence - interval .",
    "for this reason , we choose codes of length @xmath49 given by @xmath176    similar to the broadcast channel , defining the multiplexing gain @xmath40 and diversity gain @xmath41 for the cooperative multiple - access channel requires some care .",
    "note that , using , the pair @xmath177 can be defined for communication between the @xmath140 source and the destination",

    "furthermore , since cma - naf mandates that only one source transmits in any symbol - interval , the destination s multiplexing gain is also equal to @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the destination receives information at rate @xmath124 given by @xmath179 we define the overall diversity gain @xmath41 based on the worst case probability of error for the @xmath0 information streams , i.e. , @xmath180 with these definitions , theorem [ thrm:7 ] establishes the optimality of the cma - naf in the symmetric scenario with @xmath0 sources .",
    "[ thrm:7 ] the cma - naf protocol achieves the optimal ( genie - aided ) diversity - multiplexing tradeoff for the symmetric scenario with @xmath0 sources , given by @xmath181    please refer to the appendix .",

    "one can now attribute the sub - optimality of the cma schemes reported in @xcite to the use of orthogonal subspaces .",
    "it is interesting to observe that one can achieve the optimal tradeoff in the symmetric cma channel with a simple af strategy .",
    "in fact , by comparing theorems  [ thrm:1 ]  and  [ thrm:7 ] , one can see the fundamental difference between the half duplex cma and relay channels .",
    "in this section , we report numerical results that quantify the performance gains offered by the proposed protocols .",

    "[ fig : out_cma_naf ] , we compare the proposed protocols with the non - cooperative ( direct transmission ) and the ltw - af protocols . to ensure fairness , we have imposed more strict power constraints on the naf and the ddf relay protocols ; specifically , we lowered the average transmission energy of the source and the relay from @xmath27 to @xmath182 during the interval when both are transmitting .",
    "this way , the total average energy per symbol - interval , spent by any of the protocols considered here is @xmath27 . while one may find other energy allocation strategies that offer performance improvement ( in terms of the outage probability ) , any such optimization will not affect the achievable diversity - multiplexing tradeoff , and hence , will not be pursued here . to obtain lower bounds on the gains offered by the ddf and cma - naf protocols , we assume a noiseless source - relay channel for the ltw - af and naf relay protocols . for the ddf relay and the cma - naf protocols ,",
    "the snr of the link between the two cooperating partners was assumed to be only 3 db better than that of the relay - destination or source - destination channels .",
    "we optimized the broadcast and repetition gains for the cma - naf protocol experimentally .",
    "in all the considered cases , the outage probabilities are computed through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "[ fig : out_naf ] shows the performance gain offered by the naf relay protocol over both the non - cooperative protocol and the ltw - af protocol at high snrs and two different data rates .",
    "the same comparison is repeated in fig .",
    "[ fig : out_ddf ] with the ddf protocol where , as expected , the gains are shown to be larger .",
    "the cma channel is considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : out_cma_naf ] where the optimality of the cma - naf protocol is shown to translate into significant snr gains .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the gap between cma - naf performance and genie - aided strategy is less than @xmath153 db when the date rate is equal to 2 bpcu .",
    "we can also observe that the gains offered by the ddf and cma - naf protocols compared with the ltw - af protocol increase with the data rate .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the higher multiplexing gains achievable with our newly proposed protocols .",
    "overall , these results re - emphasize the fact that the full diversity criterion alone on the tradeoff curve .",
    "] is a rather weak design tool .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief comment on our choice for the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff as our design tool .",
    "this choice is inspired by the convenient tradeoff , between analytical tractability and accuracy , that this tool offers .",
    "ideally , one should seek cooperation schemes that minimize the outage probability at the target rate and snr .",
    "unfortunately , it is easy to see that such an approach would lead to an intractable problem even in very simplified scenarios . our results , on the other hand ,",
    "demonstrate that one can use the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff to analytically guide the design in many relevant scenarios . from the accuracy point of view",
    ", our simulation results validate that schemes with better tradeoff characteristics _ always _ offer significant snr gains at sufficiently high snrs . in this context",
    ", the main drawback of the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff is that it fails to predict at which snr the promised gains will start to appear .",
    "for example , from the figures , one can see that the ddf and cma - naf schemes yield performance gains at relatively moderate snrs whereas the naf protocol only offers gain at larger snrs .",
    "in this paper , we considered the design of cooperative protocols for a system consisting of half - duplex nodes .",
    "in particular , we differentiated between three scenarios . for the relay channel , we investigated the af and df protocols .",
    "we established the uniform dominance of the proposed ddf protocol compared to all known full diversity cooperation strategies and its optimality in a certain range of multiplexing gains .",
    "we then proceeded to the cooperative broadcast channel where the gain offered by the ddf strategy was argued to be more significant , as compared to the relay channel . for the multiple - access scenario , we proposed a novel af cooperative protocol where an _ artificial _ isi channel was created .",
    "we proved the optimality ( in the sense of diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ) of this protocol by showing that it achieves the same tradeoff curve as the genie - aided @xmath5 point - to - point system .",
    "our results reveal interesting insights on the structure of optimal cooperation strategies with half - duplex partners .",
    "first , we observe that , without the half - duplex constraint , achieving the optimal tradeoff in the three channels considered here is rather straightforward ( i.e. , one can easily construct a simple af strategy that results in an @xmath0-tap isi channel , and hence , the optimal tradeoff ) . with the half - duplex constraint ,",
    "more care is necessary in constructing the cooperation strategies , but , as shown , one can still achieve the optimal tradeoff in many relevant scenarios .",
    "one of the important insights is that one should strive to transmit _ independent _ symbols as frequently as possible .",
    "indeed , the optimality of the proposed cma - naf protocol stems from exploiting the distributed nature of the information to enable transmission of an independent symbol in every symbol interval .",
    "it is now easy to see that the use of orthogonal subspaces to enable cooperation , as in @xcite for example , entails a significant loss in the achievable tradeoff .",
    "this work poses many interesting questions .",
    "for example , proving ( or disproving ) the optimality of the ddf protocol for the single relay channel and @xmath135 is an open problem .",
    "generalizations of the proposed schemes to multi - antenna nodes , cooperative automatic retransmission request ( arq ) channels @xcite , scenarios with different qos constraints , and asymmetric cma channels are of definite interest . finally , the design of practical coding / decoding strategies that approach the fundamental limits achievable with gaussian codes and maximum likelihood decoding is an important venue to pursue .",
    "in this section , we collect all the proofs .      due to the source average energy constraint , setting @xmath73 and @xmath74 to anything other than the identity matrix will reduce the mutual information between @xmath22 and @xmath183 . since we are interested in obtaining an upper bound , we will choose @xmath90 and @xmath184 , in which case reduces to @xmath185 using singular value decomposition ( svd ) , the matrix @xmath52 can be factored as @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are unitary and where @xmath189 is non - negative diagonal with the diagonal elements in decreasing order . using these matrices ,",

    "that is @xmath235 plugging in for @xmath236 and @xmath237 from and , respectively , we get @xmath238 it is then straightforward to see that @xmath239 where @xmath240 and @xmath241 are the exponential orders of @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 , respectively . in deriving this expression ,",
    "we have assumed that @xmath245 ; as explained earlier , we do not need to consider realizations in which @xmath246 , @xmath247 or @xmath241 are negative .",
    "similarly , @xmath248 which , together with , and , results in : @xmath249 for the quasi - static fading setup , the outage event is defined as the set of channel realizations for which the instantaneous capacity falls below the target data rate",
    ". thus , our outage event @xmath63 becomes @xmath250 letting @xmath124 grow with @xmath25 according to @xmath251 and using , we conclude that , for large @xmath25 , @xmath252 and thus @xmath253 as zheng and tse have shown in lemma 5 of @xcite , @xmath254 provides an upper - bound on @xmath45 ( i.e. , the optimal diversity gain at multiplexing gain @xmath40 ) : @xmath255 from and , it is easy to see that the right hand side of is maximized when @xmath256 is set to its maximum , which , according to , is @xmath257 .",

    ", @xmath254 can be shown to take the value of the right hand side of .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the proof closely follows that for the mimo point - to point communication system in @xcite .",

    "the outage event @xmath63 is chosen such that @xmath261 dominates @xmath262 , i.e. , @xmath263 in which case @xmath264 in order to characterize @xmath63 , we note that , since the destination observations during different frames are independent , the upper - bound on the ml conditional pep [ recalling ] , assuming @xmath49 to be even , changes to @xmath265 where @xmath266 and @xmath267 denote the covariance matrices of destination observation s signal and noise components during a single frame : latexmath:[\\ ] ] examining , we realize that for to be met , @xmath284 should be defined as the set of all real @xmath524-tuples with nonnegative elements that satisfy the following condition for at least one nonempty @xmath525 : @xmath526 this way , by choosing large enough @xmath49 , @xmath527 can be made arbitrary large and thus is always met . from , it follows that @xmath528 substituting @xmath529 in this expression by @xmath348 gives @xmath530 on the other hand , replacing @xmath531 in by @xmath532 results in @xmath533 under the constraints given by and , it is easy to see that @xmath534 now , from and , it follows that @xmath535 again , according to , @xmath254 provides a lower - bound on the diversity gain achieved by the protocol .",
