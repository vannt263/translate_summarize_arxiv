    "recent progress in ultra - cold atoms has made it possible to study strongly correlated phenomena in a number of different contexts , which have no natural analog in condensed matter physics .",
    "one such example is spinless and spinful many - body _ bosonic _ systems , whose rich physics has been experimentally explored in the continuum and in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "large spin systems offer interesting possibilities to study the interplay between competing / complimentary orders at zero and finite temperatures such as single - particle and pair superfluidity , spin and liquid crystallinity , all of which can be probed using a variety of experimental tools @xcite . recently",
    ", attention has turned to the physics of bosonic and fermionic systems in the presence of spin - orbit coupling or artificial gauge fields @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit coupling and artificial gauge fields introduce degeneracies in the single - particle spectrum , which tends to frustrate the usual bose condensation , setting the stage for the appearance of exotic ordered phases even at the mean - field level , such as striped bose condensates which spontaneously break translational symmetry @xcite or magnetized spin stripe phases which spontaneously break time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , single particle degeneracies can amplify the role of quantum fluctuations leading to chiral superfluids @xcite or bosonic phases with topological order , which resemble the integer and fractional quantum hall effect @xcite of electrons in a magnetic field .    with these exciting experimental advances",
    ", it has become increasingly important to develop theoretical methods which are sophisticated enough to describe the multitude of order parameters and broken symmetry phases that can potentially occur in these interesting interacting systems , even at the mean - field level .",
    "in addition , it is essential to first gain significant insight into the various forms of order such systems can develop before introducing the next level of complexity through artificial gauge fields or spin orbit coupling . with this in mind",
    ", we perform a variational gutzwiller study of the mean - field physics of a spin-@xmath0 bose gas in an optical lattice , in the absence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we highlight the key virtues and limitations of this method in describing spinful bosonic systems , by giving a comprehensive account of the static and dynamic properties of the spin-@xmath0 bose gas in an optical lattice .",
    "we then supplement this method by a schwinger boson mean - field theory to capture the gapless goldstone mode in the ferromagnetic mott phase .",
    "we discuss extensions of this approach to the spin - orbit coupled , large spin problem .",
    "the bosonic gutzwiller mean - field technique , introduced by rokhsar and kotliar @xcite , describes the mean - field physics of the bose hubbard model @xcite , which is realized by trapping bosons in a deep optical lattice @xcite .",
    "known to be exact in infinite dimensions , the technique captures local physics by decomposing the full bose hubbard hamiltonian into a sum of on - site hamiltonians coupled by mean - fields .",
    "the transition from the superfluid to the mott insulator is then obtained by self - consistently solving for where the mean - field order parameter vanishes . within the mott lobes ,",
    "the gutzwiller hamiltonian is therefore purely local ( _ i.e. _ , identical to the zero hopping limit ) , and hence does not _ a priori _ capture any correlations . in the spinless case , where exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations are possible @xcite , the gutzwiller method is known to correctly capture the qualitative features of the phase diagram .",
    "we will apply the gutzwiller technique to spin-@xmath0 bosons in the current work .",
    "the equilibrium physics of this model for spinless bosons is well known , and recently it has been extended to include spinor systems , such as the one we study here @xcite . for spinless bosons ,",
    "this technique has recently also been extended to finite clusters , where the physics within an @xmath1 plaquette is solved exactly , and the plaquettes are coupled by mean - fields .",
    "systematic studies using this cluster gutzwiller method have shown that for relatively small cluster sizes , _ quantitative _ agreement is obtained for the location of the phase boundaries with numerically exact quantum monte carlo studies @xcite .",
    "importantly , such cluster methods offer a comparatively numerically efficient way to systematically incorporate correlation effects and perform non - equilibrium dynamics , which is highly relevant to ongoing experiments on strongly correlated bosons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a systematic study of the physics of the spin-@xmath0 bose hubbard model .",
    "we discuss the equilibrium theory and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the gutzwiller approach in correctly capturing the spin physics in an interacting bosonic system .",
    "although the equilibrium phase boundaries for this model have been established by several authors @xcite , a systematic study of the various order parameters present in the spin-@xmath0 bose hubbard model has been lacking . as this is essential in forming a comprehensive understanding of each phase ,",
    "a new feature of our work is a focus on the evolution of the various _ order parameters _ , such as the spin , nematic and singlet order .",
    "as these order parameters can be directly measured in experiments , such a study is a necessity in the interpretation of the experiment and the understanding of the spinful bose - hubbard quantum phase diagram .",
    "recently , several authors @xcite have extended the gutzwiller technique to capture _ dynamics _ , by linearizing the mean - field equations of motion about the superfluid and mott insulating ground states .",
    "indeed the linearized theory correctly captures the well - known bogoliubov modes in the superfluid , the gapped particle - hole like modes in the mott insulator , and correctly describes qualitative aspects of how these modes evolve across the superfluid - mott phase boundary .",
    "here we extend the time - dependent gutzwiller framework developed by krutitsky and navez @xcite to spin-@xmath0 bose hubbard model , and compute the low energy spectrum across the entire superfluid - mott phase diagram for ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic spin - dependent interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that the gutzwiller approach by itself , fails to fully capture the spin physics in the mott insulator , and therefore we supplement this theory with a schwinger boson mean - field theory , which captures inter - site magnetic fluctuations .",
    "our combined gutzwiller + schwinger boson approach thus more or less fully captures the low energy mean - field properties of the spin-@xmath0 bose hubbard model , and sets the stage for studies of more complicated correlated bosonic hamiltonians , which include spin - orbit coupling or artificial gauge fields , which we leave for future study .",

    "we note that the mean - field theory described here can be readily generalized to capture translational symmetry breaking phases by allowing the mean - field to vary on every site",
    ". however , absent spin - orbit coupling or artificial gauge fields , we do not expect translational symmetry breaking phases to occur , and therefore restrict our study to spatially homogeneous mean fields .",
    "the spin-@xmath0 system generally possesses four order parameters namely , the condensate fraction , the spin , the nematic director , and the singlet order parameter , which we determine using the ground state wave - function computed above . the condensate fraction in the three hyperfine spin states can be expressed as @xmath26 and is given simply by @xmath27    the spin is a single - particle vector order parameter given by @xmath28 in the mean - field ground state .",

    "the second order nature of the phase transition @xcite is clear from the smooth manner in which the order parameter goes to zero .",

    "[ ferrogap ] . near the phase boundary but on the superfluid side ,",
    "the effective mass of the spin mode decreases , as in a lattice , the effective mass is proportional to the hopping , which scales exponentially with the lattice depth .",
    "furthermore , the spin gap associated with the quadrupolar spin mode vanishes at the transition . at the ferromagnetic transition",
    "the superfluid density vanishes , leading to a vanishing phonon velocity .",
    "note that unlike the spinless gas however , the ferromagnetic mott insulator has long range _ spin _ order , and thus according to goldstone s theorem , has a gapless mode corresponding to spin excitations .",
    "however this mode is not captured within the naive gutzwiller approach as spin fluctuations in this theory are tied to the condensate order parameter , and therefore vanish at the mott transition . to capture spin fluctuations in the insulating phase therefore , we augment the gutzwiller theory with a schwinger boson mean - field theory for the spin , which is described next .      in the following subsection",
    "we determine the low lying excitations in the ferromagnetic mott phase using the schwinger boson mean field theory  @xcite ( sbmft ) .",
    "we will focus on the @xmath44 mott lobe for simplicity , but our results are also relevant to any value of @xmath61 with a change of the spin model parameters . working in the limit @xmath116 , we can apply standard perturbation theory in @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 is a small integer ) which yields the spin-@xmath0 biquadratic model  @xcite @xmath119 the parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 are related to @xmath122 via eq .",
    "22 of ref .  .",
    "focusing on the ferromagnetic ground state we can assume that the @xmath123 term is not sufficient to destroy the long range ferromagnetic order .",
    "thus , we can treat the biquadratic term at the mean field level , which yields @xmath124 , where @xmath125 , and therefore this decoupling essentially just renormalized the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction to @xmath126 .",
    "we generalize the spin symmetry from su@xmath127 to su@xmath128 and introduce schwinger bosons through @xmath129 , where @xmath130 are the generators of su@xmath128 and @xmath131 .",
    "the @xmath132 operators must satisfy the constraint @xmath133 , and the sbmft is exact in the limit @xmath134 .",
    "we stress that the bosonic spinon operators @xmath135 are not the bosonic operators in the bose - hubbard model in eq .",
    "[ ham ] . following standard sbmft techniques",
    "we decouple the spin - spin interaction in the ferromagnetic channel through @xmath136 , where @xmath137 , and @xmath138 denotes normal ordering .",
    "solving the sbmft equations with @xmath139 and @xmath140 at zero temperature yields a ferromagnetic ground state  @xcite with a bosonic excitation spectrum given by @xmath141 we recover the expected quadratically dispersing ferromagnetic spin waves with an effective mass @xmath142)\\sim u_0/t^2 $ ] ( in units of @xmath143 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the correct excitation spectrum in the ferromagnetic mott lobes have gapless goldstone modes which disperse quadratically and can not be captured within the gutzwiller approach .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "[ eqn : jk ] is only valid deep in the mott insulator and _ not _ near the transition where the truncation of basis states needed to arrive at this equation is no longer valid due to the vanishing of the particle - hole gap .",
    "the continuum physics of the spin-@xmath0 bose gas has been well studied experimentally , and the phase diagram is well established @xcite . by contrast , the phase diagram of the lattice spin-@xmath0 gas has received relatively little attention from the experimental community , despite the plethora of interesting phases and phase transitions present in this model . as we have shown here , the strongly correlated spin-@xmath0 superfluid and mott regimes have many distinct features that are absent in the well studied spinless bose hubbard model @xcite .",
    "indeed it will be extremely interesting to study the evolution of the nematic and singlet order parameters in a strongly correlated spin-@xmath0 gas with anti - ferromagnetic interactions , as in @xmath49na .",
    "importantly , the evolution of these order parameters reveals a first order quantum phase transition near the superfluid - singlet mott insulator , which has been confirmed numerically in @xmath0d",
    ". it will be very exciting if the predicted first order nature of the quantum phase transition can be explored experimentally .",
    "the excitations in the spin-@xmath0 gas are also strikingly different from their spin-@xmath144 counterparts . for example , unlike the spinless mott insulator , which is truly featureless , the ferromagnetic mott insulator has quadratically dispersing spin waves , corresponding to long range spin order . the excitations in the weakly interacting superfluid limit of the spin-@xmath0 ferromagnetic gas",
    "were recently explored by marti _",
    "@xcite , where a spin wave was externally imprinted on to the cloud and its coherent evolution was subsequently imaged .",
    "this method can also be applied in the mott insulating regime to explore the spin wave spectrum in the ferromagnetic mott lobe .",
    "particle - hole like excitations couple to density fluctuations which are readily generated using modulation spectroscopy @xcite or bragg spectroscopy  @xcite . for anti - ferromagnetic interactions ,",
    "the low energy excitations are nematic waves , which are linearly dispersing in the superfluid and nematic mott insulator . as is known from the theory of liquid crystals , the nematic tensor couples to the polarization of the incoming light beams , leading to optical birefringence , which can be used to probe nematic order and nematic waves @xcite .",
    "to conclude , in this paper we have presented a comprehensive mean - field description of the static and dynamic properties of the superfluid - mott insulator transition in a spin-@xmath0 bose gas .",
    "a key distinction in our work from previous works on this subject is our focus on the evolution of the important order parameters for the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interactions , namely the spin in the ferromagnetic case , and the singlet and nematic order parameter in the anti - ferromagnetic case .",
    "additionally , we have described the low lying excitation spectrum of the spin-@xmath0 gas across the entire phase diagram for positive and negative @xmath43 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "we have discussed the evolution of the singlet and the particle - hole gap , which can be probed using modulation spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the singlet gap is a new feature of the spin-@xmath0 gas , and has no analog in the spinless case .",
    "we have discussed the limitations of the gutzwiller approach in that it neglects the quantum fluctuations which couple the singlet and particle - hole modes .",
    "this would make the singlet gap vary as a function of tunneling , eventually going to zero at the singlet - superfluid transition .    on the ferromagnetic side ,",
    "we have discussed the evolution of the quadrupolar spin gap and the particle - hole like excitations across the phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , we have pointed out a shortcoming of the gutzwiller approach in describing spin fluctuations in the mott insulator . unlike the spinless mott insulator ,",
    "the ferromagnetic mott insulator is not _ featureless _ but rather is characterized by long range spin order .",
    "however , within this theory , spin fluctuations are tied to the condensate order parameter .",
    "therefore , this theory accurately captures the spin modes in the condensate and reproduces the bogoliubov spectrum at weak coupling .",
    "however , in the mott insulator , where the condensate order parameter vanishes , spin fluctuations are frozen out , and as a result , the ferromagnetic mott insulator does not have any spin fluctuations , in violation of goldstone s theorem . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "we have presented a schwinger boson mean - field theory , which retains spin fluctuations in the mott insulator and yields an additional free - particle like mode with an effective mass @xmath145 which varies like @xmath146 within the mott insulating phase .",
    "this mode is a new feature of the spin-@xmath0 gas , and can be probed using magnon interferometry @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the gutzwiller approach developed here serves as a natural starting point for exploring more complicated hamiltonians where the single particle physics involves a coupling between spin and kinetic degrees of freedom , such as the spin - orbit coupled bose hubbard model .",
    "the interplay between large spin and spin - orbit coupling can lead to simultaneous nematic , ferromagnetic orders with broken translational symmetry @xcite or exotic spin models with novel ground states even at the classical level @xcite . in the presence of single particle degeneracies such as those introduced by spin - orbit coupling , or artificial gauge fields , the absence of a bosonic pauli principle severely limits exact numerical approaches , and only small system sizes can be accurately simulated numerically . extending the gutzwiller method to study the mean - field physics of these large spin , spin - orbit coupled models is therefore imperative @xcite , and serves as a useful starting point for exploring the role of quantum fluctuations , the breakdown of mean - field theory and other strongly correlated effects , such as the fermionization of bosons in flat bands @xcite . importantly",
    ", this mean - field theory can be systematically generalized to incorporate fluctuation effects by solving the system exactly for small clusters , coupled by mean fields or by supplementing the gutzwiller method with schwinger bosons as done here to correctly capture low energy spin physics .",
