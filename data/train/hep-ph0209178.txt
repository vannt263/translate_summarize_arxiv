    "in recent years generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite have generated a considerable amount of attention .",
    "these distributions stem from hadronic matrix elements that are both non - diagonal with respect to hadron states and involve quark and gluon operators separated by a light - like distance .",
    "thus physics of both inclusive ( parton distributions , e.g. ) and exclusive ( form factors , e.g. ) reactions is contained in the gpds . at the leading - twist level , these new structure functions describe the soft physics of a variety of hard exclusive processes ( see the reviews @xcite ) .    recently two - body light - front wave function models of the pion have been used to obtain gpds @xcite based on double distributions ( dds ) @xcite .",
    "such wave functions , based on solving the weinberg equation @xcite and carrying the total charge of the pion vanish when either the quark or anti - quark carries all of the plus - momentum of the pion . the purpose of this note is to show that the use of such a model leads to gpds with undesirable features .",
    "therefore we believe that constructing simple models with the relevant physics that satisfies the reduction relations for gpds remains a considerable challenge .",
    "we proceed using the following logic .",
    "the beginning , in section [ pion ] , discusses the pion model gpd introduced in @xcite by reviewing the power - law wave function used and showing how the dd was obtained from the expression for the form factor .",
    "we also indicate the reduction relations required of the gpds . in the following section ( [ petit ] ) , the physics at the crossover @xmath0 between kinematic regions is reviewed in terms of the fock space representation .",
    "internal consistency demands a model with a vanishing distribution function ( at zero plus - momentum ) to have vanishing gpds at the crossover .",
    "the proposed model is shown not to satisfy this restriction .",
    "furthermore , the realistically modified model of ref .",
    "@xcite does not match up to the physical intuition afforded by the fock space representation which relates small @xmath1 behavior of @xmath2 to gpds at the crossover .",
    "section [ poscon ] investigates whether the models respect the positivity constraints .",
    "the realistically augmented model satisfies positivity , while its underlying wave - function - based model violates the constraint for all @xmath3 .",
    "the fock - space representation is then used to obtain dds by using the valence wave function consistently in the relevant matrix element(section [ ddfock ] ) .",
    "these dds are shown to violate lorentz symmetry by retaining @xmath4-dependence .",
    "the two - body model gpd obtained from these dds vanishes at the crossover and satisfies the positivity constraints .",
    "as a result of the @xmath4-dependence , however , moments of these gpds do not satisfy the polynomiality conditions .",
    "in particular the sum rule can not be satisfied in the valence sector alone .",
    "additionally in the appendix , we scrutinize the covariant scalar model used in the appendix of @xcite to justify the construction of the dd .",
    "parametric differentiation of a covariant field - theoretic amplitude is shown not to preserve positivity .",
    "a brief summary is presented in section [ sumy ] .",
    "here we review the basics of the model proposed by @xcite starting from the two - body wave function and ending at the double distribution . motivated by a numerical solution to an effective two - body equation for the pion @xcite , the following wave function",

    "one then determines the normalization @xmath10 from the condition @xmath11 which makes us think of @xmath12 as a wave function that in some way effectively represents contributions from higher fock components .",
    "having modeled the physics in the lowest ( @xmath13 symmetric ) fock component , the drell - yan formula @xcite is used for the form factor @xmath14 where @xmath15 . using the explicit structure of the wave function eq . , the form factor can be manipulated into the form @xmath16 with the dd @xmath17 ^ 3}.\\ ] ] here @xmath18 is just a constant related to the normalization by @xmath19 .",
    "this dd has the proper support @xcite and is _ mnchen _ symmetric @xcite : @xmath20 . in the forward limit , the @xmath21-dependence factorizes @xmath22 into the normalized profile function @xmath23 @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 the profile function @xmath23 is identical to the asymptotic quark distribution amplitude model suggested in @xcite .",
    "the properties eqs . and are essential so that the total charge @xmath26 looks like an integral of the quark distribution function @xmath2 , namely @xmath27 notice that @xmath28 .",
    "the ingenuity of dds comes about when we construct the gpd @xcite via @xmath29 in this form , the sum rule for the form factor @xmath30 and the polynomiality constraints on moments of @xmath31 are immediately satisfied .    in summary",
    ", the above model satisfies the spectral properties and reduction relations required of gpds .",
    "moreover , unlike previously used gaussian _ anstze _ for @xmath32 gpds , there is non - trivial interplay between @xmath33 , @xmath4 and @xmath34 dependence .",
    "the first inconsistency of the @xmath35 pion model comes from behavior at the crossover , i.e.  when @xmath36 . using the fock space representation of deeply virtual compton scattering @xcite",
    ", we first derive a result that focuses on the small - x behavior of the model wave function .",
    "since @xmath37 above , let us consider models such that the quark distribution function @xmath2 vanishes at @xmath38 .",
    "this quark distribution function , however , is a model of all the higher fock components .",
    "although we can not generally disentangle these components from a given model for @xmath12 , we implicitly have the restriction @xmath39 where the sum runs over all @xmath40-quarks in each @xmath41-body fock state and the integration measure is given by @xmath42 but since each term s integrand in eq .",
    "is positive definite , we must have @xmath43 whenever @xmath40 corresponds to a quark .",
    "this strong result ( which applies _ only _ to models with @xmath28 ) has a direct implication for gpds at the crossover .",
    "approaching the crossover from above we have    @xmath44    with the primed variables given by @xmath45 thus since the struck quark rebounds with zero plus - momentum , eq .",
    "forces @xmath46 to vanish .",
    "consistency requires any effective modeling of the higher fock components with a vanishing quark distribution at zero plus - momentum to mandate gpds to vanish at the crossover .",
    "here we have considered the gpd for a scalar particle . for a spin one - half bound state",
    ", the correct generalization of the above result is that the imaginary part of the deeply virtual compton amplitude @xmath47 vanishes .",
    "this is because the generalized parton distributions @xmath48 and @xmath49 enter as the linear combination @xmath50 which has a light - cone fock space decomposition similar to eq . ; the only differences are labels for identical initial and final bound - state spin .",
    "the pion model of section [ pion ] has a quark distribution function which vanishes at zero plus - momentum .",
    "thus the model effectively takes each fock component to vanish at @xmath38 , and hence we would expect this model s gpd @xmath51 to vanish at the crossover . using eq . for the model dd ,",
    "we find it is not the case ( as one could already see from figure @xmath52 in @xcite ) @xmath53    in figure [ fone ] , we show the value at the crossover as a function of @xmath54 for a few values of @xmath4 . despite the vanishing of the quark distribution function at zero @xmath1 ,",
    "the model gpd of @xcite does not vanish at the crossover .",
    "said another way , the non - vanishing behavior at the crossover is indicative of higher fock space contributions which are not present in the quark distribution function , i.e.  the constituent quarks in eq . have no sub - structure .",
    "the model gpds appear to have more physics than the underlying wave function .    acknowledging the limits of the model quark distribution function , the authors @xcite suggest implanting a more realistic distribution @xmath55 and modify the dd accordingly by using a factorization assumption @xmath56 modifying the quark distribution function according to eq .",
    "must change the wave function . considering the singular behavior ,",
    "the effective wave function @xmath57 must be dramatically enhanced at small-@xmath1 .",
    "thus one consequence we expect is a sizable enhancement to the gpd at the crossover due to the form of eq . .",
    "comparing the original gpd to the realistic one calculated from the dd in eq . in figure [ ftwo ] , we notice that the integral of eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) leads to only a small enhancement .",
    "thus the factorized assumption does not support an overlap interpretation in terms of the effective wave function .",
    "one could ask why bother looking at the crossover in the first place .",
    "experimentally @xcite the dvcs amplitude is accessed from the dominant bethe - heitler contamination through beam asymmetries . at first the interfering qed radiative processes",
    "were seen as a hindrance to unmasking the dvcs contribution to the total cross - section .",
    "now however , they seem more of a virtue , allowing access to both the real and imaginary parts of the virtual compton amplitude .",
    "the beam - spin asymmetry @xcite , for example , allows the imaginary part of the amplitude to be measured . at leading twist ,",
    "the imaginary part involves the gpds evaluated at the crossover @xmath36 . from the point of view of modeling , it would be nice to understand measurements of the beam - spin asymmetry . the above model",
    ", however has been constructed @xcite so that it should yield a vanishing value at the crossover .",
    "any non - zero result of a @xmath35 model , is simply an artifact of eq .",
    "( [ manip ] ) . as we shall show below in sect .",
    "[ ddfock ] , the integrand of that expression is not the dd because it is not obtained from is definition as a specific matrix element of field operators .",
    "a better determined @xmath35 wave function will not lead to a better understanding of gpds at the crossover .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one is concerned with the real part of the virtual compton amplitude ( which enters in the charge asymmetry @xcite ) , the gpds appear in a ( principle value ) integral weighted by the hard scattering amplitude .",
    "the crossover effects are still important because a factor of @xmath58 is present and the gpds are likely to have discontinuous derivatives .",
    "the only sophisticated model study on the market @xcite ( which arguably does qcd in the large @xmath59 limit ) shows considerable contribution ( @xmath60 ) to the cross - section from near the crossover .",
    "lastly one could hope to measure the gpds directly via double dvcs @xcite .",
    "the result proved in the light - cone fock representation in section [ petit ] concerning behavior at the crossover stemming from the small-@xmath1 limit of the quark distribution also follows from the positivity constraints for gpds .",
    "originally these constraints appeared in @xcite and were derived from the positivity of the density matrix by restricting the final - state parton to have positive plus - momentum ( and ignoring the contribution from @xmath61 for the spin-@xmath62 case ) .",
    "although the matrix elements involved for gpds are off diagonal , they are still restricted by positivity and their diagonal elements . correcting the constraints for the presence of the @xmath63-distribution",
    "was first done in @xcite . by considering the positivity of the norm on hilbert space , stricter constraints for the spin-@xmath62 distributions @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath63 have recently appeared as well as constraints for the full set of twist-@xmath65 gpds @xcite .    for the scalar pion case",
    "there is of course no contribution from the non - existent @xmath63-distribution and hence the original bounds are actually correct .",
    "when @xmath66 the positivity constraint for the spin-@xmath67 pion reads @xmath68 of course the result holds for finite @xmath69 , however since the function @xmath31 decreases with @xmath69 , so that is the tightest constraint .",
    "notice the bound at @xmath36 corresponds to the result derived in section [ petit ] provided of course the hypothesis is met : @xmath37 .",
    "the gpd derived from eq .",
    "violates the constraint for all @xmath70 as depicted in figure [ fthree ] for @xmath71 , while the augmented model satisfies the constraint .    in the realistic quark distribution model",
    "the positivity constraint is quite lenient as @xmath72 allows for no bound on the gpd at @xmath36 in equation .",
    "consequently near @xmath36 the gpd is only very loosely constrained . in general , a small-@xmath1 factorized fix - up of @xmath2 will not guarantee that the positivity constraint will be met .",
    "as we have seen the pion model proposed in @xcite violates the positivity constraint near the crossover . the realistic fix - up ,",
    "while satisfying positivity , does not agree with the intuition provided by the light - cone fock space representation which , e.g. , connects small-@xmath1 behavior to gpds at the crossover .",
    "our solution to this dilemma is to define the double distribution consistently using the same fock space representation implicitly used in eqs . and .",
    "to achieve this , we truncate the fock space at the valence sector as we did previously @xcite .    in the two - body truncated fock space",
    "the pion bound state of momentum @xmath73 appears as @xmath74 where @xmath75 corresponds to the momentum @xmath76 , while @xmath65 represents @xmath77 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we have chosen particle @xmath75 to be the quark and @xmath65 the anti - quark .",
    "one can use the theory s galilean invariance to write @xmath78 , which is the same as @xmath79 by @xmath80 symmetry .",
    "we omit helicity labels to make our analysis parallel to that of @xcite .",
    "the bound state is normalized according to @xmath81 which in turn implies the following normalization for the valence wave function @xmath82 as above , we can think of eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) as the consequence of truncating the fock space to only the valence sector , i.e.  @xmath12 must be an effective two - body wave function .",
    "the constituent quarks in our bound state , however , have no sub - structure nor should we gain lorentz invariance from eq . .",
    "the good component of the quark field @xmath83 ( with @xmath84 ) has a mode expansion    @xmath85,\\ ] ]    where the mode operators satisfy the anti - commutation relation @xmath86 and similarly for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "these equations are all consistent with the starting point of the pion model in section [ pion ] . for instance :",
    "the quark distribution function is identical to eq .",
    "@xmath89 additionally the matrix element definition of the form factor lines up with the drell - yan formula @xmath90 which is given by eq . with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , i.e.  @xmath93 .",
    "the dd is defined from the non - diagonal matrix element of bilocal field operators @xcite . to derive the dd consistently",
    ", we should respect this underlying field theoretic construction : @xmath94 dx dy.\\ ] ]    using the truncated fock space expansion of the bound state , we can express the matrix element as @xmath95,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have used the temporary replacements : @xmath96 and @xmath97 . to find the dd , we merely need to cast the above into the form dictated by eq . .",
    "thus it remains to introduce @xmath98 . before doing so explicitly ,",
    "it is wise to make a few comments . given the @xmath99 dependence of eq .",
    ", we must introduce @xmath100 only via @xmath101 . in turn , however , the resulting @xmath102 must depend on @xmath103 .",
    "this is obvious looking at the two - body partonic cartoon shown in figure [ ffour ] for the dd .",
    "in fact , one can see that any @xmath10-body fock component contribution to the dd will retain @xmath4 dependence .",
    "this should not be surprising : the light - cone wave functions are not covariant objects .",
    "it is only when summing over all fock component overlaps that the @xmath4 dependence in the dd cancels .    to cast eq . into a form from which we can read off the dd",
    ", we must use an explicit form for the wave function . using the model wave function above ,",
    "we can write @xmath104 ^ 2     \\big [ a(y ) + b(y ) \\big(\\operatorname{\\mathbf{k}^{\\perp}}+ ( 1-y)\\operatorname{\\mathbf{\\delta}^\\perp}^2\\big)\\big]^2}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that now @xmath105 and @xmath106 have been scaled by @xmath107 to be dimensionless . exponentiation of the denominators via @xmath108 allows for a gaussian integral over @xmath105 to be performed .",

    "this dd based on the field - operator matrix element is clearly different from eq . .",
    "the use of a @xmath35 wave function is a violation of lorentz symmetry which has drastic consequences for the computed dd of eq .",
    "( [ ddmess ] ) .",
    "the violation of lorentz symmetry and the _ mnchen _ symmetry is manifest in the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath128 in eq . .",
    "this @xmath4-dependence spoils the sum rule for the electromagnetic form factor .",
    "additionally the dd is restricted by @xmath4 in @xmath129 space as a result of the @xmath130-functions that maintain the light - cone spectrum condition .",
    "one way to obtain the full support properties of the dd is to use higher fock components .",
    "alternatively , one could imagine constructing a @xmath4-dependent function for the excluded region of phase space which has the properties necessary to cancel the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath128 above .",
    "in essence , this would be an attempt at solving for the ( light - cone ) instantaneous kernel for @xmath12 and utilizing crossing to access all kinematical regions @xcite .",
    "one can do so in the case of an instantaneous interaction because there are no true higher fock states .    taking the @xmath131 limit of eq .",
    "results in the pion model dd above .",
    "thus we additionally have the reduction relation at @xmath132 .",
    "it is not surprising that the @xmath133 limit corresponds to the model of @xcite .",
    "they extract the dd from the drell - yan formula which translates to calculating the matrix element in @xmath134 using the @xmath93 frame .",
    "it seems reasonable that calculation of the lorentz invariant dd can be done in the @xmath93 frame ; however , the result does not satisfy positivity .",
    "using eq . , we can show that the gpd resulting from eq .",
    "vanishes at the crossover .",
    "this follows simply from the @xmath135 behavior of @xmath128 .",
    "working with wave functions directly illuminates this . from eq",
    ", we can write down the gpd    @xmath136.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    from the above expression , we directly see the gpd s vanishing at the crossover results from the small-@xmath1 behavior of the model wave function . furthermore , as is generally true @xcite , direct application of the schwartz inequality yields the positivity constraint . in figure",
    "[ ffive ] , we plot the gpd eq . which can also be obtained from by means of eq .",
    "there is a big difference between figures [ ffour ] and [ ffive ] .",
    "lastly one could try to incorporate a realistic quark distribution by using a factorized _ ansatz _ for the double distribution .",
    "implementing eq . for the dd",
    "above , however , does not affect the vanishing of the gpd at the crossover .",
    "this is again contrary to our observation from eq .",
    "and hence the factorized assumption must not change the small-@xmath1 behavior of the wave function . a more physical _",
    "ansatz _ is effected by directly altering the behavior at the end - point : @xmath137 .",
    "this alteration maintains the positivity constraint regardless of the functional form of @xmath138 .",
    "the drawbacks of this form are clear : resulting gpds are discontinuous and the particular form of eq",
    ". leads to a singular gpd at the crossover .",
    "the effect of @xmath138 is to mimic contributions from higher fock states .",
    "continuity of the gpd arises from relations between fock components at vanishing plus - momentum .",
    "a perturbative model confirms this @xcite .",
    "constructing simple light - cone wave function models for gpds consistent with the reduction relations and positivity remains a challenge .",
    "the dd based model of gpds proposed in @xcite is appealingly ingenious , but has been shown to have undesirable properties .",
    "behavior at the crossover is inconsistent with intuition .",
    "positivity is violated because additional time - orderings involving non - two - body contributions are omitted .",
    "alternately we can view violation of the positivity constraint as resulting from parametric differentiation of a covariant field - theoretic amplitude . as shown in the appendix",
    ", such differentiation does not preserve positivity .",
    "on the other hand , the light - front fock representation of gpds is intuitively physical , satisfies positivity , but manifestly breaks lorentz symmetry .",
    "we present these problems for two reasons .",
    "firstly , to treat other theoretical attempts in this direction with caution . for example",
    ", one could imagine applying the procedure in @xcite to a better determined ( or better tuned ) valence wave function .",
    "we have shown that this will not result in a more accurate determination of the gpd .",
    "the procedure is not internally consistent ( i.e.  the positivity constraints will be violated ) and one must ultimately augment the wave function with a realistic quark distribution using an untested factorization _ ansatz_. this augmentation is an attempt to alter the small-@xmath1 behavior of the wave function . however , the resulting gpds do not match up with the physical intuition provided by the light - cone fock representation at the crossover which closely relates the low-@xmath1 quark distribution functions to gpds at the crossover .",
    "secondly we believe this cautionary note could be important to the experimentalists hoping to interpret future data .",
    "the reverse of this procedure seems to suggest one can learn about the effective valence wave function from experimental access to gpds .",
    "there is no such correspondence : the model gpd from eq .",
    "appears to contain more physics than the valence wave function from which it was derived .",
    "lastly we remark that the proposed model @xcite does provide an alternative to gaussian based forms  allowing for the correct @xmath34-dependence .",
    "while the model is useful as an analytical result , one can not take the @xmath33 and @xmath4 dependence seriously .",
    "we are indebted to a.  v.  radyushkin for discussion and correspondence .",
    "this work was funded by the u.  s.  department of energy , grant : de - fg@xmath139er@xmath140 .",
    "above we have seen that the wave function based dd does not satisfy the positivity constraint which creates doubt about the uniqueness of its construction . in their appendix , the authors @xcite , however , do not treat the wave function as in section [ ddfock ] .",
    "instead , they derive the dd in a covariant fashion from the handbag diagram with point - like couplings . by taking parametric derivatives with respect to the initial- and final - state mass - squared , eq .",

    "this is the justification presented that the procedure outlined in section [ pion ] leads to the correct dd .",
    "below we investigate positivity in this model and show that violation of the constraint comes about because of the parametric differentiation .    using the one - loop handbag diagram with scalar currents in the bjorken limit ,",

    "<S> we use a two - body , light - cone pion wave function ( which vanishes when one of the constituents carries all of the plus - momentum ) to construct a double distribution . we show that the resulting generalized parton distribution has incorrect behavior at the crossover between kinematic regions . furthermore the positivity constraints are not respected . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the field - theoretic , two - body double distribution gives generalized parton distributions that have physically correct crossover behavior and respect the positivity constraints independent of the model wave function used . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sum rule and polynomiality conditions can not be satisfied with a two - body wave function alone since lorentz symmetry is not maintained . </S>"
