    "the discovery of many extrasolar planets ( exoplanets ) by radial velocity , transit , and imaging techniques has stimulated observational and theoretical studies to characterize their atmospheric chemistry and physical properties and to investigate whether these exoplanets could sustain life forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as density decreases with height in exoplanet atmospheres , photolysis ( photodissociation of molecules and photoionization of atoms ) will eventually dominate over thermal equilibrium .",
    "this typically occurs where the atmospheric pressure is less than 1 mbar .",

    "far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation at wavelengths below 170  nm and , in particular , the very bright ly@xmath0 emission line ( 121.6  nm ) , control the photodissociation of such important molecules as h@xmath1o , ch@xmath2 , and co@xmath1 , which can increase the mixing ratio of oxygen @xcite .",
    "ozone ( o@xmath3 ) has been called a potential biosignature in super - earth atmospheres @xcite , but it is important to assess the extent to which photolysis of o@xmath1 and subsequent chemical reactions rather than biological processes can control its abundance .",
    "future photochemical models based on realistic host star uv emission including intrinsic ly@xmath0 fluxes are needed to address questions of the reliability of biosignatures and atmospheric chemical abundances .",
    "recent models , such as those cited above , show that the c / o ratio , quenching reactions , thermal structure , and diffusion also play important roles in determining mixing ratios for important molecules in exoplanet atmospheres , but the short wavelength radiation of the host star is critically important .",
    "atmospheric chemistry models require as input the fuv ( 117170  nm ) radiation from the host star .",
    "spectra obtained with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instruments on _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ are providing these data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including m dwarf stars @xcite , which many authors believe are the most favorable candidate host stars with nearby earth - like exoplanets @xcite .",
    "the _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _ instrument is also providing broadband fuv ( not including the ly@xmath0 line ) and nuv fluxes of exoplanet host stars @xcite .",
    "while the ly@xmath0 line is the most important fuv emission feature for solar - type stars and is as bright as the entire 120320  nm spectrum of m dwarfs @xcite , the entire core of this line is absorbed by interstellar hydrogen .",
    "the intrinsic flux in the ly@xmath0 line can be reconstructed from high - resolution spectra @xcite or predicted from correlations with other emission lines @xcite .    at wavelengths of 1091.2  nm , extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation from the host star photoionizes hydogen creating an ionosphere @xcite and heats the outer layers of these atmospheres , thereby inflating the atmosphere and driving mass loss .",
    "@xcite computed models that describe how photoionization heating of hot - jupiter atmospheres by euv radiation drives transonic hydrodynamic outflows ( also called hydrodynamic blow - off ) .",
    "these outflows are analogous to the parker - type solar wind @xcite , except that the heating is from above rather than below . for a hot - jupiter exoplanet like hd  209458b located at 0.05  au from its solar - type host star , the outflowing plasma is heated almost entirely by the kinetic energy of protons ( and their subsequent collisions ) after hydrogen atoms are ionized by host star euv photons with a small contribution of x - ray photons at @xmath4  nm @xcite .",
    "hot - jupiters and neptune - like exoplanets with hydrogen - rich atmospheres and weak magnetic moments can also lose mass when photoionized and charge - exchanged atomic and molecular hydrogen are picked - up by the stellar wind and coronal mass ejection plasma outside of the magnetopause standoff distance where the stellar wind pressure exceeds the planet s magnetic pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the expanding atmospheres of exoplanets in orbit around older solar - like stars are heated by the incident euv radiation and cooled by expansion ( pdv work ) .",
    "these winds are described as _",
    "energy limited_. @xcite showed that the mass - loss rates of such winds are proportional to the incident euv flux , @xmath5 .",
    "when the host star has a far larger euv flux , for example a t tauri star , x - ray heating also becomes important and radiative recombination rather than expansion cools the denser wind .",
    "the mass - loss rate for such winds is proportional to @xmath6 and @xcite call such winds _ radiation / recombination - limited_. they argue that the proper way to describe mass loss from the hydrogen - rich atmospheres of exoplanets located close to their host stars is by transonic hydrodynamic winds heated by euv photons rather than by radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others have also computed transonic hydrodynamic outflows for hot - jupiters , and @xcite have computed such models for super - earths with hydrogen - rich upper atmospheres .",
    "super - earths have much smaller mass loss rates than hot - jupiters",
    ". roche lobe overflow can enhance the mass loss rate @xcite , but the ram and magnetic pressure of a strong stellar wind on the day side of the exoplanet can suppress a transonic outflow , producing instead a subsonic outflow often called a jeans - type stellar breeze .",
    "the supersonic orbital speed of a hot - jupiter moving through a stellar wind can produce a nonspherical shock front ahead of the exoplanet s motion with properties that depend on the stellar wind , magnetic field , and exoplanet s mass loss rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for all of these cases , the host star s unobservable euv flux and the model - dependent fraction of this flux that is converted to heat ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are essential input parameters for computing realistic models of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "@xcite calculated the response of the earth s oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere to changes in the euv flux from its host star , the present day and the young sun . with a 1-d hydrodynamic model coupled to a code that describes euv photoionization and heating by secondary electrons , they find that illumination by the present day sun predicts that the upper thermosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium , but an increase in the euv flux by only a factor of 4.6 is sufficient to produce a hydrodynamic outflow that becomes the dominant cooling mechanism .",
    "a factor of 10 increase in the euv flux predicted for the young sun produces a transonic outflow .    estimating the euv emission of host stars is , therefore , an essential but difficult problem to solve because interstellar hydrogen absorbs essentially all of the spectrum between 40 and 91.2  nm , even for the nearest stars , and there are spectra in the 1040  nm range for only a few stars observed with the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) _ satellite @xcite .    despite these problems ,",
    "several authors have developed methods for estimating the euv flux for solar - type stars .",
    "@xcite estimated euv fluxes and photodissociation rates from the observed fuv and x - ray fluxes of solar - type stars and discussed the effect of enhanced euv emission from the young sun on the early martian atmosphere . following a similar approach , @xcite estimated euv fluxes for solar - type stars from the fuv and x - ray emission of the sun and six stars with spectral types g0  v to g5  v and a range of ages and thus activity .",
    "this work is appropriate for solar - type stars , but its applicability to other spectral type stars is not discussed in their papers .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a technique for estimating the euv to ir flux of the sun as a function of age ( 0.66.7 gyr ) by computing relative flux multipliers for different wavelength intervals using observations of the g - type stars @xmath7  cet and ek  dra to test the multipliers at earlier ages when the sun was more active .",
    "however , @xcite do not extend their approach to estimating fluxes for stars much different in spectral type from the sun .",
    "@xcite computed synthetic euv spectra of many f  m stars from emission measure distribution analyses of their x - ray spectra .",
    "the euv fluxes computed from their synthetic spectra may not accurately include emission in the hydrogen lyman continuum , important for the 7091.2  nm region , the he  i and he  ii continua , and may exclude some of the emission lines seen in solar spectra .",
    "we will compare our results with those of @xcite later in this paper .    in this paper",
    "our objective is to develop a different kind of technique for estimating the euv emission of host stars with spectral types f  m that is relatively insensitive to stellar activity and variability .",
    "our technique is similar to that used by @xcite in that we estimate the ratios of euv fluxes in different wavelength bands to the emission in a representative emission line , in this case ly@xmath0 .",
    "since both the euv and ly@xmath0 fluxes increase and decrease together ( but not necessarily at the same rate ) with the magnetic heating rate that depends on stellar rotation , age , and magnetic field properties , euv / ly@xmath0 flux ratios should change rather slowly with the ly@xmath0 flux . in support of this hypothesis ,",
    "@xcite show that the number of ly@xmath0 photons equals the total number of photons emitted below 170  nm by the sun at all ages from the zero age main sequence to the present , while the ratio of ly@xmath0 flux to the total solar flux below 170  nm increases smoothly from 20 to 36.5% over this time interval .",
    "we also find that euv / ly@xmath0 flux ratios vary slowly with activity and that the flux ratios in solar data and recent solar irradiance models are representative of stars with a wide range of spectral type and activity .",
    "observations with the _ euve _ satellite in the 1040  nm wavelength range and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ satellite in the 91.2117  nm range provide empirical tests of our method .",
    "when the reconstructed ly@xmath0 flux is not available for a given star , it may be estimated using the techniques described by @xcite .",
    "a natural division between the euv and the fuv occurs at 117  nm where the reflectivity of al+mgf@xmath1-coated optics of _ hst _ and other spectrographs rapidly falls to low values .",
    "efficient observations at shorter wavelengths require different optical coatings or grazing incidence optics .",
    "we therefore consider the euv to extend from 10117  nm and the fuv to extend from 117170  nm .",
    "the c  iii 117.7  nm multiplet is in the overlap region observed by both _",
    "fuse _ and _",
    "the sun is the only star for which the euv spectrum can be observed in its entirety without attenuation by the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "since interstellar absorption prevents detection of much of the euv spectrum for even the nearest stars , in particular the 4091.2  nm portion of the spectrum , we begin this study with the analysis of the solar irradiance spectrum , the flux of the sun observed as a star .",
    "the solar irradiance spectrum has been the subject of intense study stimulated , in large part , by the need to determine its variability on short- and long - period time scales that could influence the chemical composition of the earth s atmosphere and possibly drive terrestrial climate change . @xcite",
    "have reviewed the earlier studies of solar uv and euv irradiance variability and pointed out the developing instrumental techniques for increasing the photometric accuracy of the data .",
    "figure 1 shows the composite irradiance spectrum at solar minimum ( march  april 2008 , carrington rotation 2068 ) when the solar 10.7  cm flux was at a very low value of @xmath8 w m@xmath9 hz@xmath10 . at this time , an observing campaign with four instruments in space @xcite measured the solar irradiance reference spectrum ( sirs ) between 0.1 and 2400  nm , which was kindly provided by martin snow .",
    "the 0.16.0  nm spectrum was observed with the xuv ( soft x - ray ) photometer system ( xps ) of the solar euv experiment ( see ) @xcite on the _ thermosphere , ionosphere , mesosphere , energetics , and dynamics ( timed ) _ spacecraft . the rocket prototype euv variability experiment ( eve )",
    "@xcite monitored the 6.0105  nm spectral interval , and the euv grating spectrograph ( egs ) on see obtained the 105116  nm spectral interval .",
    "the 116310  nm spectrum was measured by the solar radiation and climate experiment ( sorce ) spectrometer on the _ solar stellar irradiance comparison experiment ( soltice ) _ satellite @xcite .",
    "tom woods has kindly provided a second set of solar irradiance data for times of solar minimum and maximum .",
    "these data were obtained with the see instrument on _ timed _ using the version 11 calibration .",
    "the solar minimum data are for day 105 in 2008 , and the solar maximum data are for day 76 in 2002 .",
    "we refer to this data set as the see data .",
    "table  1 lists the sirs and see fluxes in different wavelength bands .    despite very careful contamination control and calibration before launch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , euv spectrometers pointed at the sun for long periods of time typically show sensitivity degradation due to contaminated optics and detector aging @xcite .",
    "the 6.0105  nm data in the sirs data set should show minimal degradation as the spectrometer flew on a rocket and was calibrated before and after flight .",
    "the see data set , however , could include larger degradation , which is difficult to calibrate , as the solar minimum and maximum data were obtained six years apart with the same instrument in orbit .      with its lif and sic overcoated optics , the _ far ultraviolet spectrograph explorer ( fuse ) _",
    "satelite was able to observe nearby stars at wavelengths between the lyman continuum bound - free edge at 91.2  nm and 117.0  nm . for a description of the _ fuse _ satellite and observing program see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite described _ fuse _ spectra of seven a7  v to m0  v stars , and @xcite described _ fuse _ spectra of eight f  m giants .",
    "the 91.2117.0  nm spectrum is dominated by emission in ly@xmath11 and higher lyman lines ( hereafter called the lyman series ) and emission lines of c  ii 103.6  nm , c  iii 97.7  nm , and o  vi 103.2 and 103.8  nm .",
    "the lyman lines are formed in the chromosphere at @xmath12 , c  ii lines near the base of the transition region ( @xmath13 ) , and the c  iii and o  vi lines in the transition region at @xmath14 and 5.5 , respectively .",
    "much of the flux in the lyman lines is absorbed or scattered by interstellar h  i , and the lines are contaminated by terrestrial airglow emission @xcite that could not be removed accurately from the _ fuse _ data .",

    "the next brightest line is ly@xmath11 with 0.0655 erg cm@xmath9 s@xmath10 .",

    "these are 1-dimensional non - lte models of temperature vs. height structures selected to best fit the observed emitted intensity and spectral irradiance from the euv to the infrared .",
    "the calculations in the updated models include 51 species of 21 elements at various stages of ionization and h@xmath19 .",
    "for the higher ionization stages , the level populations are computed using an `` effectively optically thin '' approach , but optical thickness is considered for some lines - of - sight .",
    "the updated set of nine models is defined by corresponding levels of magnetic heating as observed in chomospheric , transition - region , and coronal emissions ( e.g. , ca ii h and k lines , the 1600    continuum , and _",

    "the solar spectral irradiance , the solar flux at 1  au , is obtained from radiative transfer calculations of the intensity at 10 positions across the solar disk .",
    "the synthesized quiet - sun computed spectrum matches the 116168  nm irradiance at solar minimum activity measured by the _ sorce / solstice _ instrument @xcite and the 6105  nm flux obtained by the _",
    "instrument @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that the higher computed continuum in the 168 - 200  nm range compared to observations is due to a missing opacity source that is likely molecular .",
    "computed fluxes of most important chromospheric and transition region emission lines are consistent with observations , although fine details of the lines are not perfectly matched by these very simplified models .",
    "overall , the match to the observed euv spectra is very good , as will be described later .    since the @xcite models refer to the same star but with different levels of euv and uv emission indicative of different levels of magnetic heating ( often called `` activity '' ) , these models are very useful for studying correlations of euv emission with many emission lines formed in the chromosphere and transition region as a function of activity for solar - like stars .",
    "@xcite showed that the 115150  nm continuum emission from models 1001 through 1005 @xcite corresponds to the observed continuum emission from low activity old solar - mass stars ( @xmath0  cen  a ) to high activity young solar - mass stars ( ek dra and hii  314 ) .",
    "we need to add the flux in the lyman series lines beginning with ly@xmath11 to the other emission lines for the five stars measured by @xcite . @xcite and previous authors that they cite noted that the ly@xmath11/ly@xmath0 flux ratio increases with solar activity . this is likely due to the higher temperatures and thus higher collisional excitation rates in more active regions on the sun .",
    "flux in the other lyman series lines should also increase faster than ly@xmath0 for the same reason .",
    "figure  2 shows that the lyman series / ly@xmath0 flux ratio increases from the least active area of the sun @xcite model 13x0 to the most active area ( model 13x8 ) .",
    "we fit these data with a power - law , log[f(lyman series)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = a + b log[f(ly@xmath0 ) ] , where a=1.798 and b=0.351 .",
    "table  2 shows the sum of the emission line fluxes measured by @xcite , the estimated lyman series flux using the above relation , the total flux in the 91.2117.0  nm band , and the ratio of this flux to f(ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows the ratio of the total 91.2117.0  nm flux to the ly@xmath0 flux ( the euv flux ratio ) for the solar models and the solar and stellar data .",
    "the asterix symbols and solid line connecting them in figure  3 are the euv flux ratios obtained from the @xcite semiempirical models 1300 to 1308 . the sun symbol is for the observed quiet sun ratio in the sirs data set , and the `` m '' and `` m '' symbols refer to the solar minimum and maximum data for the see data set .",
    "we note that the solar data lie only about 0.10 dex below the quiet and moderately active solar models 13001302 .",
    "since we are comparing euv flux ratios among stars with different radii , we plot the euv flux ratios in this and subsequent figures , vs. the stellar ly@xmath0 flux at 1  au multiplied by the scale factor @xmath20 .",
    "this scale factor enables us to compare the euv flux ratios to the ly@xmath0 flux per unit area of the stellar surface , which is a physical measure of the chromospheric heating rate .",
    "there is no need to scale either the euv flux or ly@xmath0 flux when computing the euv flux ratios as both quantities are proportional to the stellar radius and the ratio is thus independent of stellar radius .",
    "the flux in the lyman series lines beginning with ly@xmath11 is only about 20% of the total 91.2117.0  nm flux for the quiet sun models , but it increases to 30% for the active sun models .",
    "this suggests that similar ratios likely apply to stars with similar activity levels as measured by the ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "we therefore add the estimated lyman series fluxes to the observed 91.2117.0  nm line fluxes for the five stars observed by _ fuse _ and divide the sums by the reconstructed ly@xmath0 fluxes @xcite .",
    "the error bars for each star are estimates that include the estimated lyman series fluxes , assuming errors in both dimensions of @xmath21% .",
    "the least - squares fit power law to flux ratio vs. scaled ly@xmath0 flux for the five stars and the sun is log[f(91.2117.0",

    "since the uncertainty in the linear coefficient is larger than its value , we instead fit the data with a constant value log[f(91.2117.0  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = -1.025 .",
    "the mean dispersion of the solar and stellar data about this relation is only 29.5% and the rms dispersion is 35.0% .",
    "since this fit ( dash - dot line ) in figure  3 provides an excellent fit to the solar and f5 iv - v to m0  v stellar data , we argue that it can be used to predict the 91.2117.0  nm flux from a wide range of late - type dwarf stars , provided one has measurements of the ly@xmath0 flux or another spectral line that is correlated with the ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "note that the empirical fit is an excellent match to the solar data and to @xmath0  cen  a , which is a close match to the sun .",
    "the solar models ( solid line in figure  3 ) lie only 0.10.2 dex above the empirical fit to the solar and stellar data . while the contribution of the 91.2117.0  nm band to the total flux incident on an exoplanet is relatively small compared to the flux in ly@xmath0",
    ", it will be important for the photodissociation of molecules that have peak cross - sections in this wavelength range ( e.g. , co and h@xmath1 ) .",

    "the brightest emission lines superimposed on the lyman continuum are lines of o  iii ( near 84 and 72  nm ) , o  iv ( near 79  nm ) , ne  iv and ne  viii ( 7678  nm ) , and a mixture of other transition region lines at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we now consider how to isolate the lyman continuum component of the euv spectrum and then compare its flux to observable emission features .",
    "figure  4 shows the sirs lyman continuum flux measured at 12 wavelengths where there is no obvious blending with weak emission lines .",

    "@xcite have previously shown that an exponential provides a very good fit to the lyman continuum slope in the soho / sumer radiance data .",
    "the integrated flux in the lyman continuum between 60 and 91.2  nm is 0.307 erg  cm@xmath9  s@xmath10 at 1  au or 5.16% that of the ly@xmath0 flux in the same data set . by comparison ,",
    "the total flux in the lyman line series is only 0.114 erg  cm@xmath9  s@xmath10 or 1.92% of the ly@xmath0 flux .",

    "these fluxes are also well fit by straight lines in these semilog plots .",
    "note that the observed quiet sun ( sirs ) lyman continuum fluxes are similar to those of model 13x1 and that the slopes of the model data steepen with decreasing solar activity . because of the short wavelengths in the lyman continuum compared to chromospheric temperatures , the slopes of the continuum flux vs. wavelength are well fit by wien s approximation to the planck function , and the color temperatures obtained from the slopes are a good measure of the temperature where the optically thick continuum is formed .",
    "we include in table  4 the total lyman continuum fluxes , ratios to the ly@xmath0 flux , and the color temperatures .",
    "the lyman continuum flux , ratio to ly@xmath0 , and color temperature of the sirs data set are all similar to model 1301 .",
    "figure  5 shows a comparison of the ratios of fluxes in the 7080  nm , 8091.2  nm , and 91.2117  nm wavelength bands to the ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "the solid lines are least - squares fits to the euv / ly@xmath0 flux ratios for the @xcite models .",
    "the lyman continuum is the largest contributor to the 8091.2  nm wavelength band , but bright emission lines of o  iii , o  iv , and n  iv dominate the 7080  nm passband . the sirs and _ see _ solar data points for the 91.2117  nm passband are in excellent agreement with the model predictions .",
    "for the 8091  nm and 7080  nm wavelength bands , the sirs data agree with the models better than the _ see _ data .",
    "the spectrum below 60  nm includes a number of features formed in the chromosphere , including the he  i continuum visible between 45 and 50.4  nm and emission lines of he  i ( 58.4 and 53.7  nm ) and he  ii ( 30.4 and 25.6  nm ) .",
    "he  ii 30.4  nm is the brightest emission line in the 1091.2  nm region .",
    "this line is formed primarily by collisional excitation in the chromosphere , but a portion of the emission is recombination following photoionization of he@xmath26 by coronal radiation @xcite .",
    "there are also a number of transition region lines of o  ii , o  iii , o  iv , and n  iii located in this spectral region .",
    "beginning with the mg  x ( 61.062.5  nm ) and si  xii ( 49.952.1  nm ) multiplets , coronal emission lines increasingly dominate the spectrum at shorter wavelengths .",
    "thus the 1060  nm portion of the euv spectrum of the quiet sun is a combination of emission from the chromosphere , transition region , and corona .",
    "figure  6 compares the euv / ly@xmath0 flux ratios with the @xcite models and the sirs and _ see _ solar reference data .",
    "the agreement of the sirs and quiet sun _ see _ data with the models is very good , but the active sun _ see _ data are low compared to the models for the 5060  nm and 6070  nm wavelength bands . in the absence of any stellar data for comparison with the solar ratios or models , we suggest using least - squares fits to the models with the parameters listed in table  5 .    at wavelengths shorter than about 40  nm , modest interstellar absorption to the nearest stars",
    "permits detection of euv radiation , thereby providing empirical tests of the accuracy with which the solar data and models can provide estimates of the euv flux ratios for different spectral type stars .",
    "we compare in figure  7 the solar 1020  nm flux ratios to _ euve _ flux ratios ( corrected for interstellar absorption ) @xmath18 versus scaled ly@xmath0 fluxes for 15 stars with spectral types between f5  iv - v ( procyon ) and m5.5  v ( proxima centauri ) .",
    "the least - squares fit to the data for the f5k7 stars is log[f(1020  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = @xmath27 + @xmath28 log[f(ly@xmath0 ) ] .",
    "the mean deviation about this fit line is 20.5% and the rms deviation is 29.0% .",
    "there is no apparent trend with spectral type . excluding the ev  lac and au  mic flare data ( see later in this section ) , the remaining five m stars have nearly the same euv flux ratios .",
    "since the linear coefficient in the least - squares fit to these data is smaller than its uncertainty , we fit the data with a constant value , log[f(1020  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = 0.491 .",
    "the m star flux ratios have a small mean deviation of 12.6% and a small rms deviation of 15.1% . also plotted in figure  7 are flux ratios for the @xcite models .",
    "the flux ratios of @xmath0  cen a+b and procyon are very close to the quiet sun models and data , and the flux ratios for the other g- and k - type stars are also consistent with the solar model ratios .",
    "our recommend fitting relations are summarized in table  5 .",
    "figure 8 is a similar comparison of solar and stellar data and solar model flux ratios for the 2030  nm wavelength region .",
    "the least - squares fit to the data for the f5k7 stars is log[f(1020  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = @xmath29 + @xmath30 log[f(ly@xmath0 ) ] with a mean deviation of 47.6% and an rms deviation of 56.6% . again excluding the ev  lac and au  mic flare data",
    ", the five m stars can be fit by log[f(2030  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = 0.548 .",
    "the mean deviation about this fit is 24.3% and the rms deviation is 26.9% .",
    "the solar model ratios are consistent with the @xmath0  cen  a+b and the other f- , g- , and k - star data .    finally , figure 9 shows a similar plot for the 3040  nm data . since the interstellar absorption corrections exceed a factor of 3 for this bandpass when log [ n(h  i ) ] @xmath31 , the flux ratios for au  mic and ad  leo depend critically on the uncertainties in the n(h  i ) parameter .",
    "the models fit the solar data well , but have a slightly different slope than the f5  v ",
    "k7  v stars .",
    "since the linear coefficient in the least - squares fit to the f5k7 stellar flux ratios is consistent with zero , we fit these data with log[f(3040  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = 0.882 , with a mean deviation of 37.1% and an rms deviation of 41.0% .",
    "the m star flux ratios , except for the two flaring stars , can be fit with log[f(3040  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] = 0.602 with a mean deviation of 18.9% and an rms deviation of 20.5% .",
    "table  5 summarizes these fits and the dispersions of the stellar data points about these fits .    since we do not have ly@xmath0 fluxes for ev  lac and au  mic during their flares , we consider two different ways of representing their flare flux ratios . in figures 79",
    ", we plot the ratios of the observed euv flare fluxes divided by the reconstructed quiesent ly@xmath0 fluxes vs. the scaled quiescent ly@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "this almost certainly overestimates the flux ratios and places the data points at unrealistically low scaled ly@xmath0 flux levels .",
    "the dashed lines extending downwards and to the right in the figures show the location of the ratios with increasing ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "the correct ratios should lie along these dashed lines .",
    "we estimate the most likely values of the ly@xmath0 flux during the flares by noting the factors by which the euv fluxes during the flare of au mic exceed the quiescent values and using the formulae in table 5 .",
    "the symbols at the lower right end of the dashed lines in the figures indicate the most likely values for the flare ratios and scaled ly@xmath0 fluxes for the two stars .",
    "these flare ratios are close to the mean nonflare ratios for m dwarf stars , indicating that the fits obtained using the quiescent m star data should be useful for estimating euv fluxes of m dwarfs over a wide range of activity , provided the ly@xmath0 flux is appropriate for the given level of activity .",
    "there are three sources of error in our technique : errors in the euv fluxes , errors in the reconstructed ly@xmath0 fluxes , and errors associated with stellar variability since the euv and ly@xmath0 fluxes were not obtained at the same time . the mean and rms dispersions about the fit lines reflect all three sources of error .",
    "the uncertainties in the ly@xmath0 reconstructions are probably in the range 1030% , depending on the quality of the observations and the complexity of the interstellar medium velocity structure .",
    "the dispersions for the f5k5 stars about the fits lie in the range 2037% .",
    "this is consistent with errors in the euv fluxes and errors associated with stellar variability each being in the range of 1020% .",
    "the dispersions for the m stars are smaller , 1324% .",
    "although this was unexpected , it may result from the exclusion of obvious flaring events during the measurements of the ly@xmath0 and euv fluxes .",
    "also the m stars are located closer to the sun than the f5k5 stars , in which case the velocity structure of the ism should be simpler and the lyman@xmath0 reconstructions more reliable .",
    "expansion of the m star data set would be helpful in understanding the relative contributions of the three components to the dispersions .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter sf2011 ) developed a technique for predicting euv fluxes based on an emission measure analysis of observed stellar x - ray spectra .",
    "this method predicts the emission line spectrum between 0.1 and 91.2  nm but may not accurately include the lyman continuum , important between 70 and 91.2  nm , or the he  i and he  ii continuua below 50.4  nm and 22.8  nm . in table  6 , we compare predicted euv flux ratios for the five stars in sf2011 table  4 for which @xcite list ly@xmath0 fluxes .",

    "euve_. in the 1020  nm band , the flux ratio predicted using our formula ( see table  6 ) and sf2011 are both consistent with the _ euve _ spectrum of @xmath16  eri corrected for interstellar absorption , @xmath18 . in the 2030  nm band ,",
    "our formula predicts a flux ratio 0.22 dex below the _ euve _ data and the sf2011 prediction is 0.09 dex larger than the _ euve _ data . in the 3040  nm band ,",
    "the sf2011 prediction is 0.07 dex larger than observed by _ euve _ , and our formulae predicts a flux ratio 0.14 dex smaller . in the 7091.2  nm band , where the lyman continuum is an important contributor to the emission , the inclusion of the lyman continuum flux would likely place the sf2011 ratio about 0.3 dex above our model prediction for @xmath16  eri .",
    "the four other stars listed in table  6 without _ euve _ spectroscopic data show no clear pattern in the predicted flux ratios based on our formulae and sf2011 . for hd  209458 ( g0  v ) , the upper limits predicted by sf2011 all lie below , and at some wavelengths far below , the flux ratios predicted by our formulae .",
    "this highlights the problem of computing emission measure distributions based on very weak or upper limits to the x - ray fluxes . for hd  189733",
    "( k1  v ) , the flux ratios predicted by sf2011 are systematically high compared to our formulae , and for gj  436 ( m3  v ) they are systematically low compared to our formulae . for gj  876 ( m5.0  v ) the sf2011 flux ratios are very low compared to our formulae in the 1020 and 2030  nm bands , but comparable in the longer wavelength bands .",
    "finally , we compare in table  6 the 91.2117  nm flux ratios predicted by our formulae with the fluxes obtained using the emission measure analysis technique listed in the x - exoplanets website described in sf2011 divided by the reconstructed ly@xmath0 fluxes @xcite .",

    "the f(91.2117  nm)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ratio obtained from the _ fuse _ emission line fluxes @xcite and estimated lyman series flux is 0.2 dex below that predicted by our method but 0.9 dex above that obtained from the data in the x - exoplanets website .",
    "the missing flux in the x - exoplanet website predictions likely indicates the inadequate treatment of emission lines formed at temperatures below @xmath32  k.",
    "euv fluxes from host stars control the photochemistry , heating , and mass loss from the outer atmospheres of exoplanets , especially for those exoplanets located close to their host stars .",
    "the objective of this study is to develop a useful technique for predicting the euv fluxes of f5m5 dwarf stars , since there are only a few measurements of stellar euv fluxes and interstellar absorption prevents measurements between 40 and 91.2  nm for all nearby dwarfs stars except for the sun .",
    "our technique employs ratios of euv fluxes in wavelength bands to the ly@xmath0 flux , because models of the solar chromosphere , transition region , and corona show that the euv flux scales with the ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "moreover , models of solar regions with different amounts of magnetic heating show temperature structures with similar shapes but displaced deeper into the atmosphere ( and thus higher densities ) with increasing magnetic heating .",
    "these empirical and theoretical arguments gives us confidence that the ratios of the euv flux in various wavelength bands to the ly@xmath0 flux should vary smoothly with stellar activity at least for stars that do not differ too greatly from the sun in spectral type .",
    "models of stellar chromospheres and transition regions comparable in detail with the solar models of @xcite are needed to confirm the range of stars for which our technique is useful . until such models are available ,",
    "observations of the few stars in the 91.2117.0  nm range by the _ fuse _ satellite and in the 1040  nm range by the _ euve _ satellite show that our ratio technique is useful for f5m5 dwarfs .",
    "table 5 summarizes our recommended formulae for predicting the log [ f(@xmath33)/f(ly@xmath0 ) ] ratios in nine wavelength bands . for the 1020  nm , 2030  nm , and 3040  nm wavelength bands , we recommend using the formulae based on the stellar fluxes observed by _",
    "euve_. our formulae predict flux ratios similar to the observations and to the emission measure analysis predictions of sf2011 , as indicated by comparison with the _ euve _ data for @xmath16  eri .",

    "the agreement between the _ fuse _ data and our model predictions shown in figure  3 suggests that the ratios for m stars may be the same as for the warmer stars .",
    "fits to the flux ratios based on the _ fuse _ data and our formulae are in good agreement . on the other hand ,",
    "the predictions of the emission measure analysis models in the x - exoplanets website are far below our models and the _ fuse _ observations of @xmath16  eri .",
    "figures 79 and table  5 show that for the f5k5 stars the mean deviations from the fit lines lie in the range 2048% , and for the nonflaring m stars the mean deviations lie in the range 1224% .",
    "thus our formulae should be useful in predicting the euv flux ratios for f5m5 dwarf stars .",

    "<S> extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiations ( 10117  nm ) from host stars play important roles in the ionization , heating , and mass loss from exoplanet atmospheres . together with the host star s ly@xmath0 and far - uv ( 117170  nm ) radiation , euv radiation photodissociates important molecules , thereby changing the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> since stellar euv fluxes can not now be measured and interstellar neutral hydrogen completely obscures stellar radiation between 40 and 91.2  nm , even for the nearest stars , we must estimate the unobservable euv flux by indirect methods . </S>",
    "<S> new non - lte semiempirical models of the solar chromosphere and corona and solar irradiance measurements show that the ratio of euv flux in a variety of wavelength bands to the ly@xmath0 flux varies slowly with the ly@xmath0 flux and thus with the magnetic heating rate . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests and we confirm that solar euv / ly@xmath0 flux ratios based on the models and observations are similar to the available 1040  nm flux ratios observed with the _ euve _ satellite and the 91.2117  nm flux observed with the _ fuse _ satellite for f5  v  </S>",
