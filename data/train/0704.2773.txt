    "cleo recently extracted @xmath6 from a measurement of the direct photon spectra in @xmath7@xcite .",
    "that extraction was based on a comparison of the @xmath8 width to the dominant three - gluon width of the narrow bottomonium resonances .",
    "since the direct photon is observable above background only for relatively high energies ( @xmath9 ) , some model dependence is inherent in the determination of the total @xmath8 rate . given a prescription relating the parton - level rate to @xmath6 , one can then use that rate to determine @xmath6 . to extrapolate beyond the experimentally accessible direct photon energy region ,",
    "cleo relies on theoretical parameterizations of the expected photon energy spectrum in the @xmath0 system@xcite to obtain the total direct @xmath10 decay width relative to the dominant @xmath11 width .",
    "the theoretical calculations are generally done at the parton level , and therefore avoid possible resonant contributions to the photon energy spectrum due to two - body decays , e.g. , @xmath12 , with @xmath3 some resonant hadronic state .",
    "alternatively , one would like to understand hadronization in @xmath12 , which is measured experimentally as a two - body process . for example",
    ", cleo has recently observed signals in several low - multiplicity modes@xcite , and has presented preliminary results consistent with the final state @xmath0(1s)@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15@xcite .",
    "we point out , however , that the product of ( branching ratio)@xmath16(efficiency ) for all known exclusive modes , combined with the observed level of background , implies a signal yield below the statistical sensitivity required to be observed as a distinct signal in the inclusive spectrum .    from the experimental standpoint , the presence of possible digluon resonances opposite the photon leads to `` bumps '' in the otherwise smooth predicted theoretical photon spectra .",
    "the inability of the current calculations to directly address two - body effects , in part , restricts the applicability of @xmath0 decay models to the region @xmath17 , with @xmath18 defined as the scaled photon energy ( @xmath19 ) . @xmath0 decay models are also not reliable above this point because one of the emitted gluons is of such low energy that a perturbative calculation can not be trusted@xcite .",
    "given that primary glueball candidates are of order 1 gev in mass , we expect the endpoint region of the photon energy spectrum ( @xmath20 0.92 ) to be most susceptible to such contamination .",
    "older estimates of @xmath6 based on inclusive radiative photon production in @xmath0 decay using the blm@xcite prescription have consistently yielded values smaller than those obtained from different techniques@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been realized that color octet contributions previously ignored in the older blm calculation result in estimates of @xmath6 in excellent agreement with estimates made at the z - resonance@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , subtraction of possibly - enhanced exclusive contributions to the overall rate would , in principle , result in a lowered estimate for the ratio of rates @xmath21 and a correspondingly larger estimate for @xmath6 . to set the scale , given that the typical branching fraction for @xmath10 is of order @xmath22 , a total resonant enhancement at the level of @xmath23 would result in a @xmath245% reduction in the estimate of @xmath6 at the z - pole .    by comparison ,",
    "a large fraction of all @xmath25 decays have been identified as two - body@xcite",
    ". two - body contamination ( and larger relativistic corrections ) also makes the @xmath26 system somewhat less reliable than the @xmath0 in estimating @xmath6 .",
    "this systematic consideration in the @xmath8 analysis motivates our search for radiative decays of the @xmath0 to resonances : @xmath0(ns)@xmath27 ( n=1 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "we concern ourselves with high multiplicity ( @xmath28 charged tracks ) final states , as we employ the same hadronic event selection cuts in this analysis that we did in the @xmath8 analysis @xcite .",
    "we note that although two - body branching fractions have been observed for , e.g. , @xmath0(1s)@xmath29 at the level of @xmath4 , the fraction of @xmath30 decays into @xmath314 charged tracks is only @xmath32@xcite .",
    "the analysis , in general terms , proceeds as follows . after selecting a high - quality sample of @xmath33 annihilations into hadrons using the hadronic event selection cuts of the previous analysis @xcite",
    ", we construct the inclusive isolated photon spectra in data taken at both on-@xmath0-resonance and off-@xmath0-resonance energies ( the latter samples are used for systematic checks of the overall procedure ) .",
    "a two - body radiative decay of the @xmath0 will produce a monochromatic photon in the lab frame ; the energy of the radiated photon @xmath34 is related to the mass of the recoil hadron @xmath3 via @xmath35 . in the case",
    "where the intrinsic width of the recoil hadron is much smaller than the experimental photon energy resolution , the measured radiative photon energy should be a gaussian centered at the energy @xmath34 .",
    "for a 1 gev ( 4.5 gev ) recoil photon , this implies a recoil resonance with width typically narrower than 20 mev ( 260 mev ) . not knowing",
    "_ a priori _ the mass of the hadron @xmath3 , we therefore perform a set of fits of the @xmath0(ns ) photon spectrum to a gaussian signal , centered at a series of @xmath34 values , and with resolutions corresponding to the known cleo  iii electromagnetic calorimeter resolution atop smooth polynomial backgrounds , over the range @xmath36 . threshold .",
    "given our photon energy resolution , all processes of the type @xmath37 result in photons relatively close in energy and produce an apparent enhancement in the region @xmath38 . in the previous analysis@xcite , we also identified an excess of photons in data as @xmath39 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "further examination of these events indicated that they were dominated by continuum production : @xmath40 , although the possibility that the 4-pion state resulted from the decay of an intermediate resonance @xmath3 was not investigated . ]",
    "we construct 95% confidence level upper limits from these fits as a function of recoil mass @xmath5 , corrected for the efficiency loss due to the fiducial acceptance of the detector and the event and photon - selection cuts that define our data sample . in estimating this correction",
    ", we assume @xmath3 has spin=0 , with a corresponding @xmath41 angular distribution for the recoil gamma ; higher spins will generally give flatter angular distributions .",
    "note that the exact form of the efficiency correction due to the event and photon selection cuts varies with the decay final states considered for @xmath3 . in the high - momentum region typical of the particles recoiling against the direct photon ,",
    "our per - track charged particle detection efficiency is generally @xmath3190% over the fiducial volume . to be conservative",
    ", we derive our @xmath18-dependent efficiency correction from the decay mode yielding the worst reconstruction efficiency .",
    "this final efficiency - corrected limit is converted into an @xmath5-dependent branching ratio upper limit @xmath42 by dividing the resulting yield by the calculated total number of resonant @xmath0 events .",
    "for the off - resonance running , the distributions are divided by the off - resonance luminosity for the sake of comparison between continuum samples .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath47(@xmath48 , @xmath45 ) has been grossly exaggerated for the sake of presentation ( @xmath49 , well above any observed radiative decay fraction into @xmath50 charged tracks ) .",

    "event selection criteria in this analysis are identical to those imposed in the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "the inclusive photon spectra are therefore identical to those taken from our previous analysis as well .",
    "the background shape is approximately exponential in the region @xmath36 .",
    "to extract the possible magnitude of a two - body radiative signal , we step along the inclusive photon spectrum over the interval @xmath36 , fitting it to a gaussian with width equal to the detector resolution at that value of photon energy , plus a background parametrized by a smooth chebyshyev polynomial .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic width of the resonance @xmath3 is considerably smaller than the detector resolution .",
