    "an important topic in quantum mechanics is the spectral theory of schrdinger operators on the hilbert space @xmath0 with potentials supported on a discrete ( finite or countable ) set of points of @xmath1 .",
    "there is an extensive literature on such operators ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first mathematical problem is to associate a self - adjoint operator ( hamiltonian ) on @xmath2 with the differential expression @xmath3 there are at least two natural ways to associate self - adjoint operator @xmath4 with the following differential expression in @xmath5 @xmath6 for any fixed set @xmath7 . the first one is based on the quadratic forms method .",
    "another way to introduce local interactions on @xmath8 is to consider maximal operator corresponding to @xmath9 and impose boundary conditions at @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath11    in contrast to one - dimensional case , the differential expression does not define an operator in @xmath12 , by means of the quadratic forms since the linear functional @xmath13 is not continuous in @xmath14 for @xmath15 . however , it is still possible to apply the extension theory approach .",
    "namely , f. berezin and l.  faddeev in their pioneering paper @xcite proposed to consider ( with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) in the framework of extension theory .",
    "they associated with @xmath18 the family of all self - adjoint extensions of the following symmetric operator @xmath19 it is well known that @xmath20 is closed non - negative symmetric operator with equal deficiency indices @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite , the authors proposed to associate with the hamiltonian certain @xmath22-parametric family @xmath23 describing local point interactions .",
    "they parameterized the family in terms of the resolvents .",
    "the latter enabled the authors to obtain an explicit description of the spectrum for any operator from the family @xmath24 .",
    "in the recent publications @xcite , boundary triplets and the corresponding weyl functions technique ( see @xcite and also section [ prelim ] ) was involved to investigate multi - dimensional schrdinger operators with point interactions ( the cases @xmath25 ) . in the present paper , we apply boundary triplets approach to parametrize all self - adjoint extensions of @xmath20 .",
    "besides , using weyl functions technique , we investigate their spectra .",
    "moreover , we substantially involve the theory of radial positive definite functions @xcite in our approach .",
    "in particular , we employ strict positive definiteness ( see definition [ defpoz ] ) of the functions @xmath26 and the bessel functions @xmath27 with any @xmath28 on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , to prove pure absolute continuity of non - negative spectrum of any self - adjoint realization of @xmath31 . for this purpose",
    "we complete the classical schoenberg theorem @xcite regarding the integral representation of radial positive definite functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is introductory .",
    "it contains definitions of a boundary triplet and the corresponding weyl function @xcite and also facts about the weyl functions @xcite . in section 3 ,",

    ", we investigate 3d- and 2d - schrdinger operators with point interactions , respectively .",
    "namely , in subsection 4.1 ( resp . , 5.1 ) , we define boundary triplet @xmath33 for @xmath34 and compute the corresponding weyl function .",
    "it appears to be close to that contained in krein s resolvent formula for the family @xmath23 in @xcite . in particular , for the proof of the surjectivity of the mapping @xmath35 we employ the strict positive definiteness of the function @xmath36 on @xmath37 for any @xmath38 .",
    "subsections 4.2 and 5.2 are devoted to the spectral analysis of the self - adjoint realizations of @xmath31 . to investigate the absolutely continuous spectrum we apply technique elaborated in @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we need invertibility of the matrices @xmath39 which we extract from the strict positive definiteness of the functions @xmath26 and @xmath40 on @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that in the proof of theorems [ spec3 ] and [ spec2 ] our complement to schoenberg theorem is used in full generality . indeed",
    ", it follows from the integral representation that the strict positive definiteness of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for all @xmath28 yields the strict positive definiteness of any radial positive definite function @xmath43 on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "finally , description of the non - negative self - adjoint extensions of @xmath20 ( @xmath44 ) is provided in subsection 4.3 . for suitable choice of a boundary triplet @xmath45",
