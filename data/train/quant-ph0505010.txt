    "recent developments in powerful lasers have induced great theoretical and experimental interests in quantum systems under the influence of periodic driving fields .",
    "for example , an active topic in the field of atomic physics is the dynamical stabilization of atoms by intense high - frequency laser fields @xcite .",
    "scattering of particles by a time - periodic potential is frequently used as a model for the photon - assisted tunneling and other quantum transport problems @xcite .",
    "the interesting phenomena of coherent destruction of tunneling in a periodically driven two - level systems has also been discussed extensively in the last decade @xcite .",
    "although diverse phenomena related to time - periodic potentials have been widely investigated , in our opinion the interesting issue of quantum decay through tunneling of a metastable system trapped in a time - dependent potential should receive more attention than it has thus far .",
    "metastable systems which decay through tunneling exist and are of interest in many areas of studies , the most famous of which being the @xmath0-decay of atoms . in many realistic situations of decay processes ,",
    "the metastable systems have to be treated as being influenced by time - dependent potentials .",
    "for example , in some versions of the inflationary models of the early universe @xcite , inflation is governed by a higgs field trapped in a metastable state .",
    "inflation ends when the metastable state decays to the true ground state of the universe . during inflation",
    "the universe expands exponentially .",
    "it is thus obvious that the metastable state of the higgs field is trapped in a rapidly varying potential .",
    "unfortunately , in these inflationary models the true forms of the time - dependent potentials are determined by the dynamics of the system itself .",
    "this inherent difficulty makes the complete analysis of time - dependent decay of the higgs field rather difficult .",
    "it is therefore desirable to gain some insights first by studying metastability in various types of time - dependent potentials in simple quantum - mechanical models .    in our previous work @xcite",
    "we have proposed a simple metastable system with a moving potential which has height and width scaled in a specific way introduced by berry and klein @xcite . in that model",
    "we found that a small but finite nondecay probability could persist at large time limit for an expanding potential .",
    "another class of time - dependent metastable system had been discussed by fisher@xcite , in which he considered a generic class of static metastable well subjected to a weak time - periodic force . as the strength of the time - periodic force",
    "was taken to be small , it could be treated as a small time - dependent perturbation term .",
    "fisher modified the standard ( time - independent ) wkbj approach to include a weak time - dependent perturbation .",
    "he found that the weak time - periodic force always enhances the time average of the decay rate of the system .",
    "the potential considered by fisher has a number of oscillator - like levels near its minimum .",
    "the opposite situation where only two levels are present was considered by sokolovski @xcite , who studied the effect of a small ac field mixing two levels in the well on the tunneling rate in a semiclassical framework .",
    "recently , we have considered the problem of how the metastability of a quantum system used to model the @xmath0-decay was influenced by an oscillating barrier @xcite .",
    "the floquet formalism was adopted in our analysis , so that the periodic field needs not be treated perturbatively , and the number of states in the potential is not restricted .",
    "our results show that an oscillating potential barrier generally makes a metastable system decay faster .",
    "however , the existence of avoided crossings of metastable states can switch a less stable state to a more stable one , and vice versa .",
    "it is also found that increasing the amplitude of the oscillating field may change a direct crossing of states into an avoided one .",
    "hence , by a combination of adiabatic changes of the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillating barrier , one can manipulate the stability of different states in a quantum potential .",
    "if in the static well there exists a bound state , then it is possible to stabilize a metastable state by adiabatically changing the oscillating frequency and amplitude of the barrier so that the unstable state eventually crosses over to the stable bound state . in this connection",
    "we note here that a related problem was studied in @xcite , where the authors consider trapping an electron in thermal equilibrium within an infinite wall and a barrier which grows in time . there",
    "the confinement of particle in the well is achieved through the increase in the barrier height , whereas in our case it is accomplished mainly through the tuning up of the frequency of the oscillating barrier .    in @xcite",
    "our main concern was the effect of avoided crossing on the quantum metastability in a periodically oscillating potential . in this paper",
    "we shall present a detailed study of the effect of direct crossing on the stability of a metastable system , and of how the oscillating amplitude affects the nature of direct / avoided crossings .",
    "we consider a simple quantum system in which a particle is trapped in between an infinite wall and a rectangular barrier .",
    "two versions of the system are discussed . in model",
    "a we consider the potential with an oscillatory height , while in model b we make the bottom of the well oscillate instead . as in our previous work ,",
    "the floquet approach is adopted here . in each model , an equation which relates the floquet quasienergy of the driven system to the amplitude and frequency of the time - periodic potential is obtained .",
    "this equation is solved numerically and the stability of the system is investigated as the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating field vary . to our surprise ,",
    "the two models , very different in nature , turn out to possess the same floquet energy spectrum ( and thus the same stability ) .",
    "a discrete transform connecting the two models is found which explains the exactness of the floquet spectrum . a physical understanding of the equivalence of the two models is also given based on the principle of gauge invariance .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we will first briefly describe a simple metastable model of @xmath0-decay .",
    "iii then introduces a modified model to include a time - periodically oscillating barrier ( model a )",
    ". we will also describe the floquet theory which we adopt in our analysis .",
    "the effects of the time - periodically oscillating barrier on the quantum metastability of the system is studied numerically in sect .",
    "model b , which has the bottom of the well oscillating , is described in sect .",
    "v. sect .",
    "vi and sect .",
    "vii present , respectively , the discrete transform and the gauge transformation that connect the two models .",
    "viii summarizes the paper .",
    "a simple one - dimensional model to describe the phenomena of @xmath0-decay is that of a particle trapped in between an infinite potential wall and a finite barrier @xcite .",
    "the barrier potential of such a metastable system can be expressed as @xmath1 the wave function of the system has the well - known form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 satisfies the time - independent schrdinger equation , @xmath4   \\psi(x)=e\\psi(x)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the wave function can be expressed in each regions as @xmath5    besides the ordinary boundary conditions which require that the wave function and its first derivative be continuous at the boundaries @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we could also impose another two boundary conditions on the wave function by physical consideration .",
    "one is @xmath8 as the wave function must vanish at the origin @xmath9 ; the other is @xmath10 since there is no extra nonvanishing potential in the region @xmath11 to reflect wave from the right - hand side of the barrier .",
    "this later condition was first introduced by gamow @xcite , curney and condon @xcite , and is usually called the  gamow s outgoing wave boundary condition \" in the literature . with these boundary conditions , we can eliminate the remaining coefficients @xmath12 of the wave function and obtain an equation that determines the eigenenergy of the system , @xmath13 by solving the above equation numerically for a given barrier height @xmath14 , one finds that the solution of eq.([static result ] ) gives complex eigenenergy , @xmath15 . the imaginary part is related to the decay rate of the state . despite some conceptual difficulties concerning the nature of complex energy , this simple approach by imposing gamow s outgoing wave boundary condition successfully describes the exponential decay of metastable systems @xcite .",
    "we now modify the static model to include a time - periodically oscillating barrier , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . unlike the static case , in this time - dependent model we have to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath19   \\psi(x , t)~.   \\label{schrodinger}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a similar time - periodically oscillating potential ( without the infinite wall ) has been used to investigate electrons scattering in a time - dependent potential by li and reichl @xcite .",
    "they employed the floquet formalism to set up the s - matrix of the driven system .",
    "the advantage of the floquet formalism is that one could do away with any restriction of the amplitude and frequency of the driving force . here",
    "we will mainly follow the procedure developed in @xcite to construct the wave function of our model of metastable system .",
    "the floquet theorem states that the wave function of a time - periodic system has the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a periodic function @xmath22 with the period @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the floquet quasienergy , or simply the floquet energy .",
    "it should be noted that the floquet energy is determined only modulo @xmath25 . for",
    "if @xmath26 is a solution of the schrdinger equation , then @xmath27 is also a solution for any integer @xmath28 .",
    "but they are physically equivalent as the total wave function @xmath29 is the same @xcite .",
    "all physically inequivalent states can be characterized by their reduced floquet energies in a zone with a width @xmath25 .",
    "we therefore consider solutions of @xmath24 only in the first floquet zone , i.e. @xmath30 .    the schrdinger equation inside the region of the oscillating barrier @xmath31 is @xmath32   \\phi_{\\var}(x , t )   = \\var \\phi_{\\var}(x , t)~.   \\label{equiv schr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] letting @xmath33 , eq.([equiv schr ] ) can be separated into @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant to be determined from the periodicity of the function @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "eq.([t - dep ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath39 where we have set the initial condition as @xmath40 .",
    "the second factor in eq.([f(t)_1 ] ) can be rewritten using the identity @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "eq.([f(t)_1 ] ) then reduces to @xmath43 the periodic condition @xmath38 , which reads @xmath44 requires that @xmath45 ( @xmath46integer ) . so the constant @xmath36 can only assume the following values @xmath47 the allowed values of @xmath36 indicate that the time - periodic potential will generate side - band structures with @xmath48 as the  side - band energy \" of the @xmath49-th side - band .",
    "knowing the allowed values of the constant @xmath50 , we can now solve eq.([x - dep ] ) to get @xmath51 combining eq.([f(t ) ] ) and eq.([g(x ) ] ) , we obtain the wave function inside the region of the oscillating barrier @xmath52 , @xmath53 having gotten the wave function inside the region @xmath31 , the continuity of the wave function and its first derivative at the boundaries @xmath6 and @xmath7 at any time requires that outside the region @xmath31 there are nonvanishing wave functions on each side - band channel .",
    "therefore the wave function in the region @xmath54 is @xmath55 which vanishes at the origin , @xmath56 . on the other hand , the gamow s outgoing wave boundary condition suggests that the wave function in the region @xmath11 to have the form @xmath57    we can obtain relations among the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 by matching the boundary conditions at @xmath6 and @xmath7 for each side - band .",
    "the results are @xmath60 the floquet energy is determined from these relations by demanding nontrivial solutions of the coefficients . in practice , however , we must truncate the above equations to a finite number of side - bands , eg .",
    ", @xmath61 .",
    "the number @xmath62 is determined by the frequency and the strength of the oscillation according to @xmath63 @xcite .    to determine the floquet energy @xmath24 , we first separate the boundary conditions for the central band @xmath64 from the other side - bands @xmath65 in eq.([b.c.1])-([b.c.4 ] ) ( we set @xmath66 for simplicity ) : @xmath67 the coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath65 ) in eq.([b.c.1 - 2]-[b.c.4 - 2 ] )",
    "can always be related to the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 s and @xmath74 s are functions determined as follows . eliminating the @xmath75 s and @xmath76 s in eq.([b.c.1])-([b.c.4 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 as mentioned before , in practice a truncated version of eqs .",
    "( [ b.c.neq0_1 ] ) and ( [ b.c.neq0_2 ] ) has to be used . in a @xmath80 side - bands approximation ,",
    "the index @xmath28 ranges from @xmath81 to @xmath80 except @xmath82 .",
    "then eqs . ( [ b.c.neq0_1 ] ) and ( [ b.c.neq0_2 ] ) together represent a set of @xmath83 equations with @xmath83 unknowns @xmath84 and @xmath85 . the solutions of these unknowns can then be solved by the cramer s rule @xcite in the forms of eq.([a_l ] ) and eq.([b_l ] ) .    replacing the @xmath86 s and @xmath87 s by means of eqs.([a_l ] ) and ( [ b_l ] )",
    ", one can rewrite eqs.([b.c.1 - 2 ] ) to ( [ b.c.4 - 2 ] ) as @xmath88 where the coefficient @xmath89 are @xmath90 then by eliminating the coefficients @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath91 in eqs.([b.c.1 - 3 ] ) to ( [ b.c.4 - 3 ] ) , we arrive at an equation which is a function of @xmath92 , @xmath93 its solution determines the floquet energy of the metastable system . comparing this equation with the corresponding one for the static case , i.e. eq.([static result ] ) , we see the effect of the time - periodic potential is contained entirely in the coefficients @xmath94 .    in the next section",
    "we will solve eq.([solution ] ) numerically .",
    "once the floquet energy @xmath24 of the metastable system is determined , the probability of the particle still being trapped by the potential barrier at time @xmath95 , i.e. the non - decay probability @xmath96 , can be obtained as @xmath97 with @xmath98 . the imaginary part of the floquet energy , which enters @xmath96 via the factor @xmath99 , gives a measure of the stability of the system . unlike the static case , however , here @xmath96 is not a monotonic function of time , owing to the time - dependent function @xmath100 .",
    "but since @xmath100 is only a periodic function oscillating between two values which are of order one , the essential behavior of @xmath96 at large times is still mainly governed by the exponential factor .",
    "hence , as a useful measure of the nondecay rate of the particle in the well , we can use a coarse - grained nondecay probability @xmath101 defined as @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the time average of @xmath100 over one period of oscillation .",
    "owing to the complexity of the coefficients @xmath104 , the solution of eq.([solution ] ) has to be obtained numerically .",
    "we shall present the numerical analysis in the next section . here",
    "let us consider the limiting cases of our model . from the expressions of the coefficients @xmath104 ( eq.([f_1 ] ) to eq.([f_8 ] ) ) , we can easily check the coefficients @xmath104 all approach one when the parameter @xmath105 , @xmath106 hence in the limit @xmath107 or @xmath108 , eq.([solution ] ) is identical to eq.([static result ] ) in the static case , and the floquet energy in these limits are just the complex eigenenergy of the static case .",
    "this is understandable , since in the limit @xmath107 the potential becomes static .",
    "and at very high frequencies , the dynamical time scale of the particle in the well is much larger than the time scale of the oscillating barrier @xmath109 , hence the height of the time - periodically oscillating barrier seen by the particle should be its time - averaged value , namely , @xmath110 , which is independent of the time - oscillating part of the barrier @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the quantum metastability of model a by finding the solutions of eq.([solution ] ) numerically .",
    "we are interested in the metastability of the system under different amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillating barrier , since these are the experimentally controllable parameters . for definiteness",
    ", we take the barrier to have height @xmath111 in the atomic units ( a.u . )",
    "@xmath112 , and boundaries at @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( a.u . ) . with these parameters , there is only one solution with @xmath115 in the static case .",
    "this is a metastable state having complex energy @xmath116 .",
    "other solutions have @xmath117 and are more unstable .",
    "we shall be interested in this paper only in the coupling between the metastable state @xmath118 and the next higher one with @xmath119 .",
    "coupling between other metastable states can be considered similarly . for the oscillating potential",
    ", we shall solve eq.([solution ] ) numerically for cases with different oscillating amplitude @xmath120 and frequency @xmath121 .      in this subsection",
    "we first study how good a 2 side - bands approximation is by comparing it with the 3 side - bands approximation .",
    "floquet energy as a function of the amplitude of the oscillating barrier @xmath122 evaluated based on 2 side - bands ( solid line ) and 3 side - bands ( dotted line ) approximations are shown in fig.(1 ) and fig.(2 ) for @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned before , if @xmath125 is a solution of the schrdinger equation , then @xmath126 is also a solution for any integer @xmath28 . and they are physically equivalent as the total wave function @xmath29 is the same . for metastable system , this means that all floquet states with real parts differing by @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) will have the same imaginary part .",
    "we have checked this for @xmath129 in the 2 and 3 side - bands approximations .",
    "part(a ) [ part(b ) ] of fig .",
    "1 and 2 show the relation of the real ( imaginary ) part of the floquet energy and the oscillating amplitude parameter @xmath130 at fixed @xmath131 .",

    "the divergence of the three curves at higher @xmath134 is caused by the truncation of the number of side - bands in numerical analysis .",
    "fig.(1-b ) shows that the 2 side - bands approximation is good for @xmath137 at @xmath123 ( i.e. @xmath138 ) , and the 3 side - bands approximation is accurate for @xmath136 at @xmath139 ( i.e. @xmath140 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the usual requirement for the n side - bands approximation mentioned previously , namely , @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "similar argument for the accuracy in the approximation can also be checked in fig.(2-b ) .",
    "stability of the system is determined by the imaginary part of the floquet energy . from part ( b ) of fig .  1 and 2",
    ", we see that the imaginary part of floquet energy increases as @xmath134 increases .",
    "this means that , at fixed frequency , a larger oscillating amplitude will cause the system to be less stable . on the other hand , once @xmath122",
    "is reduced to zero the quantum metastability of the system will approach to the static case @xmath142 , because , as we explained at the end of the last section , in the limit @xmath143 the driven system reduces to the static case .      in this subsection , we will investigate the effects of the oscillating frequency and amplitude on the quantum metastability of the system in the 2 side - bands approximation . as we have learned in the previous subsection ,",

    "that is , these branches of @xmath152 emanate from either @xmath150 or @xmath153 at @xmath154 .",
    "branches emerging from the same point have the same imaginary part .",
    "numerical results show that , with the barrier oscillating , these states become less stable . for simplicity , in fig .",
    "( 3a ) we show only two branches emerging from the two states with @xmath150 ( solid curves for @xmath155 ) and @xmath153 ( dotted curves for @xmath156 ) in the static case .",
    "as mentioned before , solutions can always be reduced to the first floquet zone , @xmath152 ( modulo @xmath131 ) , which are points under the line @xmath157 .",
    "figure ( 3-b ) shows that the imaginary parts the floquet energies of the two states fluctuate slightly as the frequency changes . at frequency close to the resonance frequency @xmath158",
    ", a direct crossing of the real parts of the floquet energies of the two states occurs .",
    "this is indicated by the point @xmath159 in the first floquet zone , or equivalently , point @xmath7 in the second floquet zone . that it is a direct crossing",

    "further only enhances the difference of the floquet energies at the point of avoided crossing ( fig .  6 and 7 ) . at and beyond the avoided crossing , the two states exchange stability :",
    "the second and originally less stable state becomes more stable than the first state , which now assumes a stability which is of similar order of magnitude as that of the second state before the crossing .",
    "such phenomenon has been previously discussed in @xcite .",
    "the above results indicate the possibility of controlling stability of states in a quantum well .",
    "one may tune up the frequency adiabatically up to the point where the real parts of the floquet energy of the two states meet .",
    "if the crossing is a direct crossing , then one can increase the magnitude of the oscillation @xmath134 of the barrier before the crossing until the direct crossing turns into an avoided one . when the frequency is increased further to pass beyond the avoided crossing , the two states exchange stability .",
    "then by reducing @xmath134 to zero , the two states in the static well are interchanged .",
    "if the lowest energy in the static well is a stable bound state ( as in the case discussed in @xcite ) , the above procedure can turn an upper metastable state into a stable one .",
    "let us now consider a variant of the above model , namely , the static model with a time - periodically oscillating bottom instead of an oscillating barrier .",
    "the potential can be expressed as @xmath169 the wave function inside the barrier well , i.e. , @xmath170 , can be obtained by the similar procedure as in sect .",

    "more recently , we have also realized that the underlying physics responsible for the equivalence of the two models is the gauge equivalence of the models , which we shall present in sect  vii .",

    "( [ j2 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ j1 ] ) becomes @xmath210 , which is exactly the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "let us now apply the transform to eq .",
    "( [ b.c.b-1 ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath222 we recognize that this is the same equation , eq .",
    "( [ b.c.1 ] ) , satisfied by @xmath223 and @xmath224 , with the same floquet energy @xmath24 and frequency @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that the two sets of coefficients are related by @xmath225 similarly , by applying the transform to eq .",
    "( [ b.c.1 ] ) , we get eq .",
    "( [ b.c.b-1 ] ) with the same connections , namely , eq .  ( [ coeff-1 ] ) , among the coefficients . with this connection of the coefficients",
    "it is seen that eqs .",
    "( [ b.c.1 ] ) and ( [ b.c.b-1 ] ) are dual pairs under the @xmath226 transform .",
    "now consider the transform of eq .",
    "( [ b.c.b-3 ] ) . with eq .",
    "( [ coeff-1 ] ) , we get @xmath227 this is the same as eq .",
    "( [ b.c.3 ] ) with the same floquet energy and frequency , provided that the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath228 are related by the @xmath226-transform in the following forms : @xmath229    the above discussions show that , the two models are mapped into one another under the @xmath226-transform , with the relevant coefficients in the wave functions being related through eqs .",
    "( [ coeff-1 ] ) and ( [ coeff-2 ] ) .",
    "hence the floquet energy spectra as function of oscillation s amplitude and frequency of the two models are identical .",
    "the wave functions , however , are different , since they have different forms , namely , eqs .  ( [ wf-2])-([wf-3 ] ) for model a , and eqs .",
    "( [ wf - b1])-([wf - b3 ] ) for model b. nevertheless , it turns out that the relations between their coefficients in the region @xmath230 , where the particle is confined , can be understood as the result of a gauge transformation of the two wave functions .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we show the underlying connection between the two models based on gauge invariance principle .",
    "one needs only to consider the region in @xmath231 , since the metastable system in these two models is mainly confined within this region .",
    "the region @xmath11 does not affect the essential physics underlying the two models .",
    "this is because for a metastable state , its wave function is extremely small ( nearly identical to zero , as confirmed numerically ) in the region @xmath11 before the system has actually decayed .",
    "this region serves only as an ideal drain .",
    "the gauge transformation of a quantum system with an @xmath232-independent gauge function @xmath233 is given by : @xmath234 when the gauge function @xmath235 is chosen to be @xmath236 the potential in region @xmath237 in model a , eq .  ( [ potential ] ) ,",
    "is transformed into @xmath238 this potential is physically equivalent to the potential describing model b in the same region : they only differ in the origin of the time variable @xmath239 by an amount @xmath240 .",
    "hence , the potentials of the two models are related by a gauge transformation with gauge function eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) and a time shift @xmath241 .",
    "we now examine the connection between the wave functions of the two models in the regions considered . under the gauge transformation described by eqs .",
    "( [ gauge ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) , the wave function of model a transforms according to @xmath242 with @xmath243 which can be easily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ bessel ] ) by changing @xmath134 to @xmath244 and using the fact @xmath245 . according to the previous discussion",
    ", we shall make the shift @xmath241 in @xmath246 and compare the resulted wave function @xmath247 with that of model b.    first we consider the region @xmath170 .",
    "the wave function of model a in this region , eq  ( [ wf-1 ] ) , is gauge - transformed into @xmath248 in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ wf - g1 ] ) the index @xmath80 is changed to @xmath249 , and @xmath250 . with the shift @xmath251 , the time - dependent factor in eq .",
    "( [ wf - g1 ] ) picks up a factor @xmath252 .",
    "accordingly the wave function is shifted to @xmath253 it is now clear that the wave function @xmath254 in eq .",
    "( [ wf - s1 ] ) is equivalent , up to an irrelevant phase factor , to @xmath255 of model b , eq .",
    "( [ wf - b1 ] ) , with the identification of @xmath256 as discovered in the last section .",
    "now we turn to the wave functions in region @xmath31 . the relevant wave function of model a , eq .  ( [ wf-2 ] ) ,",
    "is gauge - transformed to @xmath257 where we have used @xmath258 , and relabeled the index in the last expression . by making the same shift in the time variable ,",
    "the wave function changes to @xmath259 the sum over @xmath28 in the last factor is simply the kronecker delta symbol @xmath260 according to eq .",
    "( [ j2 ] ) . hence @xmath261",
    "again , up to the irrelevant phase factor , the wave function @xmath262 is equivalent to @xmath263 of model b , with @xmath264 and @xmath265 as before .",
    "the gauge equivalence of the wave functions of the two models in the physically relevant regions provides a physical understanding of the identity of their floquet spectra .",
    "finally , we note here that from such gauge invariance argument it also follows that the static problem is equivalent to the problem with the bottom of the well and the top of the barrier oscillating in phase with the same frequency and amplitude .",
    "in this paper we investigate the stability of a particle trapped in between an infinite wall and square barrier , with either a time - periodically oscillating barrier or bottom of the well . in these models",
    "we do not restrict the amplitude of the time - periodically oscillating potential to be small , so a nonperturbative approach based on the floquet theory is adopted to tackle the problem .",
    "for each case we derive an equation to determine the floquet energy of the system .",
    "the imaginary part of the floquet energy can be used as a measure of the stability of the system .",
    "it is found that in general the oscillating field causes a quantum metastable state to decay faster .",
    "but when the floquet energies ( real part ) of two states make a direct crossing , the more stable of the two states will undergo a resonance - enhanced decay , whereas the less stable state is slightly stabilized near the resonance frequency . beyond the resonance frequency ,",
    "the states resume stability of the original order of magnitude .",
    "however , if the crossing is an avoided one , the two states will switch stability : the less ( more ) stable state becomes more ( less ) stable .",
    "this gives the possibility to stabilize a metastable state , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we further found that when the amplitude of the oscillating potential is increased , a direct crossing could change into an avoided one .",
    "thus , our results show that one can manipulate the stability of different states in a quantum potential by a combination of adiabatic changes of the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillating barrier .",
    "the two models we considered here were found to have identical floquet energy spectrum for the same frequency and amplitude of the oscillating field .",
    "this was explained by a discrete transform which connects the equations of boundary conditions of the two models , and by a gauge transformation which maps the wave functions of the two models .",
    "these arguments also guarantee that the model discussed in @xcite will have the same floquet spectrum , whether the oscillating part is the barrier or the bottom of the well .",
