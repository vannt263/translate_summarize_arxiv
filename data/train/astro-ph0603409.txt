    "a major contribution to this difference could be the temperature of the dust , but it is important to realize that this just means an sed peaking at longer wavelengths . the best - fit submm sed ( solid curve in fig .",

    "the top axis shows the corresponding star formation rate ( sfr ) using the expression in kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "using templates based on local ulirgs with a fixed luminosity - temperature relation ( ce01 ) , the submm flux will typically overestimate the luminosity .",
    "this effect is most dramatic for less luminous submm objects which tend to lie at lower redshifts where the 850@xmath1 m window samples even further from the ir sed peak .    the median ir luminosity ( using radio , submm and infrared flux ) for our sample is l@xmath24=@xmath25 , which corresponds to a sfr of @xmath26m@xmath27 .",

    "a composite rest - frame sed shows that the submm sources peak at longer wavelengths than those of local ulirgs .",
    "this demonstrates the strong selection effects , both locally and at high redshift , which may lead to an incomplete census of the ulirg population .",
