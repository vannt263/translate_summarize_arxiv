    "general relativity is based on local lorentz invariance , yet recently there appeared a lot of attempts to go beyond local lorentz symmetry @xcite .",
    "aether can be considered as locally preferred state of rest at each point of space - time due - to some unknown physics .",
    "einstein - aether theory is general relativity coupled to a dynamical time - like vector field @xmath0 , which is called `` aether '' .",
    "this theory is what comes instead of usual general relativity when local lorentz symmetry is broken .",
    "namely , @xmath0 breaks local boost invariance , while rotational symmetry in a preferred frame is preserved ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "different observable consequences of einstein - aether theory have been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "quasi - normal modes have been studies recent years extensively , because of their interpretation in conformal field theory @xcite and possible , but yet unclear significance in loop quantum gravity . at the same time , one of the most promising ways to check the theory of gravity as a fully non - linear theory is to observe the characteristic frequencies of black holes called _ quasi - normal modes _ @xcite .",
    "qn frequencies are expected to be observed in the nearest future with the help of a new generation of gravitational antennas .",
    "this suggests a unique opportunity to test the spontaneous breaking of the local lorentz invariance , through observing deviations of quasi - normal modes of black holes from their values in einstein theory .    therefore , we would like to know what comes instead of the well - known quasi - normal spectrum of black holes in einstein - aether theory . for",
    "this one must have a solution describing black holes in the einstein - aether theory .",
    "fortunately such a solution has been recently obtained in @xcite , yet , only numerically .",
    "that was one of the motivations for us for developing of the method for finding quasi - normal modes for potentials which are not known in analytical form , but are given only numerically in some region near a black hole ( see sec .",
    "iii of this paper ) . in case of asymptotically anti -",
    "de sitter space - times , the method for finding qn modes for metrics given by a set of differential equations was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we found here that quasi - normal modes for spherically symmetric black holes in the non - reduced einstein - aether theory have larger real oscillation frequency and damping rate than the corresponding qn modes in the locally lorentz invariant einstein gravity .",
    "the lagrangian of the full einstein - aether theory forms the most general diffeomorphism invariant action of the space - time metric @xmath1 and the aether field @xmath2 involving no more than two derivatives given by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the ricci scalar , @xmath5 is a lagrange multiplier which provides the unit time - like constraint , @xmath6 where @xmath7 are dimensionless constants .",
    "spherical symmetry allows to fix @xmath8 . in this letter , following @xcite , we shall consider the so - called _ non - reduced _ einstein - aether theory , for which @xmath9 , and we can use the field redefinition that fixes the coefficient @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11 so that @xmath12 is the free parameter .",
    "the metric for a spherically symmetric static black hole in eddington - finkelstein coordinates can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath13 where the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by numerical integration near the black hole event horizon @xcite .",
    "one can re - write this metric in a schwarzschild like form : @xmath16",
    "now , let us consider test scalar and electromagnetic fields in the background of the black hole given by the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "here we shall use general covariant generalizations of scalar and electromagnetic wave equations , i.e. we neglect interaction of these fields with aether .",
    "this can be well understood , since the background of a large astrophysical black hole has much more influence on propagation of fields during quasi - normal ringing than aether , at least not very far from the black hole . yet",
    ", such phenomena as tales at asymptotically late times are probably affected by asymptotic regions of space - times as well as by a black hole itself .",
    "thus , the wave equations for test scalar @xmath17 and electromagnetic @xmath18 fields are : @xmath19 @xmath20 after making use of the metric coefficients ( [ metric ] ) , we found that the perturbation equations can be reduced to the wave - like form for the scalar and electromagnetic wave functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 the effective potentials take the form : @xmath24 @xmath25    below we shall also use the particular case of the above metric when @xmath26 and @xmath27 , what corresponds to an ordinary schwarzschild black hole .",
    "now we are in position to find quasi - normal spectrum for the above wave equations . yet ,",
    "as the function @xmath15 , and @xmath14 are known only numerically , in the next section we shall have to develope a new technique for finding of quasi - normal modes in this case .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from tables [ tresbeg]-[tresend ] we can see that real and imaginary parts of @xmath28 is about @xmath29 greater for @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 is growing up to @xmath32 , both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are growing by about @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the wkb method gives an error of about a fraction of a percent .",
    "therefore our conclusion , that in the above region of @xmath38 , the observed here effect of a few percents is much larger than the order of the wkb error .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath39 , the wkb error is about @xmath40 ( see table [ tresend ] ) , therefore we can not judge about the value of the aether effect in the case @xmath39 for small @xmath31 .",
    "yet for @xmath41 , the effect a few times greater than the error , and , qualitatively the behavior of the qn spectrum is the same : the larger @xmath31 leads to a larger real oscillation frequency and damping rate .",
    "the quasinormal modes of black holes should be feasible for observation by new generation of gravitational antennas .",
    "this would make a great impact on gravitational physics , where gravitational waves have not been not observed .    at the same time",
    ", the gravitational consequences of local lorentz symmetry violation must show itself in radiative processes around black holes .",
    "gravitational radiation damping of binary pulsars orbits reproduces the weak field general relativity at the lowest post- newtonian order @xcite .",
    "the significant difference between einstein and einstein - aether theories can show itself in the regime of strong field , i.e. in changing the characteristic quasi - normal spectrum of black holes .",
    "thereby , aether , if exists , could be indirectly observed through observation of characteristic spectrum of black holes .",
    "this motivated us to perform the present study of quasi - normal modes for black holes in einstein - aether theory .",
    "in this paper we developed a new method for finding quasi - normal modes for potentials determined only numerically in some region near a black hole .",
    "then , the method has been applied here to numerical black hole solution in einstein - aether theory , which has been obtained recently in @xcite .",
    "we showed that quasi - normal modes of einstein - aether black holes have larger damping rate and real oscillation frequency than qnms of schwarzschild black holes have .",
    "we considered here scalar and electromagnetic test fields in the background of a spherically symmetric black hole .",
    "the wave equation for gravitational perturbations could be found by consideration of perturbations of the complete system of einstein - aether equations .",
    "then our approach for finding of the quasi - normal modes can be applied as well . yet , it is well known , that quasinormal modes in the eikonal approximation are the same for fields of different spin .",
    "therefore we expect qualitatively the same results for gravitational perturbations as we observed for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations .",
    "if the breaking of lorentz symmetry is not very small , i.e. @xmath31 is not very small , the deviation of the qn modes from their schwarzschild values might be observed in the forthcoming experiments with gravitational antennas .",
    "this work was supported by _ fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) _ , brazil .",
    "we would like to thank c. eling for sharing with us his numerical code for integration of the einstein - aether equations .",
