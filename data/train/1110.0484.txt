    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has renewed interest in the idea that these objects might instead have formed at the center of their own dark matter halos @xcite or are the stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies @xcite , thus providing a deeper gravitational potential for the retention of enriched material .",
    "observational evidence , however , argues against dark matter in globular clusters , at least at the present time .",
    "photometric studies of cluster profiles @xcite and dynamical studies of milky way globular clusters @xcite show no evidence for dark matter , at least out to the tidal radius in these systems .",
    "an interesting possible exception to the conclusion that globular clusters do not contain dark matter is palomar  13 ( pal13 ) , a low luminosity milky way globular cluster ( @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at a galactocentric distance of 25kpc .",
    "the combined size and luminosity of pal13 ( see figure  [ fig_sizemv ] ) is more similar to the milky way ultra - faint galaxies than a typical milky way globular cluster @xcite .",
    "motivated in part by its low luminosity and relatively large size , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c02 ) measured velocities for 21 member stars in pal13 based on keck / hires ( high resolution echelle spectrometer ) spectroscopy .",
    "their velocity dispersion of @xmath11 km  s@xmath1  is well in excess of that predicted from the stellar mass of pal13 alone .",
    "in contrast , velocity dispersions of six other extended outer halo globular clusters measured by these authors are consistent with their stellar masses @xcite .",
    "c02 also measure a shallow surface brightness profile for pal13 and a king tidal radius that is significantly larger than the predicted tidal radius based on the stellar mass of the cluster .",
    "c02 interpreted the inflated velocity dispersion and shallow luminosity density profile of pal13 as due either to tidal heating during a recent perigalacticon passage , implying that the cluster is not in dynamical equilibrium , or the presence of dark matter .",
    "if pal13 is in dynamical equilibrium , its measured velocity dispersion implies the highest mass - to - light ratio known in a globular cluster , @xmath12 .",
    "the proper motion of pal13 , measured by @xcite via photographic plates , implies that this cluster is on a highly eccentric orbit near perigalacticon .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that pal13 is in the final stages of tidal disruption , and its increased velocity dispersion is due to tidal heating .",
    "however , n - body simulations by @xcite are unable to reproduce either the inflated velocity dispersion or shallow density profile using the measured orbit .",
    "interestingly , these authors can reproduce the photometric properties of pal13 assuming that instead it is near apogalacticon , i.e. ,  at the farthest point in its orbit . in this case , the observed surface brightness profile is not due to tidal heating , but rather due to projection effects as unbound stars , removed in the course of slow tidal evaporation , are compressed near apogalacticon . in these simulations , binaries are still required to explain the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "a high unresolved binary star fraction is a third proposed explanation for the large velocity dispersion observed in pal13 .",
    "@xcite estimated the pal13 binary star fraction as @xmath13 based on a secondary red main sequence and the presence of a large number of blue straggler stars .",
    "this is higher than observed for more massive globular clusters , but consistent with that of lower mass globular clusters .",
    "@xcite measured a lower velocity dispersion ( @xmath14 km  s@xmath1 ) for pal13 based on eight member stars .",
    "seven of these stars overlap with c02 ( note blecha et al .",
    "state only six ) , including three stars which are identified as velocity variables in one or both samples .",
    "given the small number of stars , it is yet unclear whether binaries can indeed provide an explanation for the high velocity dispersion in pal13 without invoking tidal heating or the presence of dark matter .",
    "here we present keck / deimos spectroscopy and cfht / megacam imaging of the milky way globular cluster pal13 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec_data ] we discuss data acquisition and reduction for both our spectroscopic and photometric datasets , including estimates of structural parameters . in  [ sec_membership ] we discuss the techniques used to identify spectroscopic members . in  [ sec_results ]",

    "we also examine the blue straggler population of pal13 . finally , in  [ sec_discussion ] we interpret our results , concluding that the kinematics of pal13 are consistent with its stellar mass and find only mild evidence for tidal effects at large radii .    throughout this paper ,",

    "we select spectroscopic targets in pal13 based on canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) cfh12k and keck / lris ( low resolution imaging spectrometer ) imaging as described in c02 .",

    "member stars were identified in @xmath17- and @xmath18-bands , and @xmath17- and @xmath19-band when @xmath18-band was not available .",
    "targets were selected based on proximity to a @xcite theoretical isochrone for an age of 12gyr and a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this isochrone was used for target selection only ; a slightly better fitting isochrone is used in the subsequent analysis ( see figure  [ fig_full_cmd ] ) .",
    "we determine a star s distance to the isochrone via the quantity @xmath21 ^ 2 + ( v _ * -v_{\\rm iso})^2}$ ] .",
    "stars on the red giant branch ( @xmath22 20.5 ) within d = 0.1mag of the isochrone were given the highest priority for spectroscopy ; stars within 0.2mag of the isochrone were given lower priority .",
    "on the subgiant branch and main sequence ( @xmath23 20.5 ) and on the horizontal branch the selection region was widened to within 0.2 and 0.3 mag of the isochrone for the higher and lower priority categories , respectively . candidate blue straggler stars were chosen in a box blueward of and brighter than the main sequence turnoff / subgiant branch region .",
    "following the photometric selection , spectroscopic targeting priorities were set to favor known radial velocity members from c02 and @xcite , and likely proper motion members from @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic data were taken with the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the deimos spectrograph @xcite .",

    "the masks were observed with the 1200  line  mm@xmath1grating covering a wavelength region @xmath24 . the spectral dispersion of this setup was @xmath25 pixel@xmath1 , equivalent to r=6000 for our @xmath26@xmath27 wide slitlets , or a fwhm of @xmath28 .",
    "the spatial scale was @xmath26@xmath29  per pixel .",
    "the minimum slit length was @xmath30 which allows adequate sky subtraction ; the minimum spatial separation between slit ends was @xmath26@xmath31 ( three pixels ) .",
    "spectra were reduced using a modified version of the spec2d software pipeline ( version  1.1.4 ) developed by the deep2 team at the university of california - berkeley for that survey .",
    "a detailed description of the reductions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final one - dimensional spectra were rebinned into logarithmic wavelength bins with 15 km  s@xmath1  per pixel .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the observed science spectra with a series of high signal - to - noise stellar templates .",
    "we employ the telluric absorption lines in the stellar spectra to calculate and apply a correction for the radial - velocity errors that arise from a mis - centering of the star in the spectrograph slit .",
    "each science spectrum is cross - correlated with a hot stellar template where the telluric absorption lines are the dominant spectral features .",
    "since these lines are illuminated by the stellar flux , this defines the star s photocenter within the slit in velocity space .",
    "we applied both a telluric and heliocentric correction to all velocities presented in this paper .",
    "we determined the random component of our velocity errors using a monte carlo bootstrap method .",
    "noise was added to each pixel in the one - dimensional science spectrum , we then recalculated the velocity and telluric correction for 1000 noise realizations .",
    "error bars are defined as the square root of the variance in the recovered mean velocity in the monte carlo simulations . the systematic contribution to the velocity error",
    "was determined by @xcite to be 2.2 km  s@xmath1  based on repeated independent measurements of individual stars and we refer the reader to this paper for further details .",
    "the systematic error contribution is expected to be constant as the spectrograph setup and velocity cross - correlation routines are identical .",
    "we added the random and systematic errors in quadrature to arrive at the final velocity error for each science measurement .",
    "radial velocities were successfully measured for 482 of the 566 extracted spectra across the nine observed deimos masks .",
    "the fitted velocities were visually inspected to ensure reliability .",
    "we identified 90 sources as background galaxies or qsos , and obtained repeat measurements for 62 stellar sources .",
    "our final stellar sample consists of 392 measurements of 306 unique stars .",
    "after our spectroscopic observations , we obtained significantly deeper images of pal13 using the cfht megacam imager .",
    "these images were taken as part of a larger program aimed at obtaining deep wide - field imaging of all bound stellar over - densities in the galactic halo beyond 25kpc ( r. muoz et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "pal  13 was observed on the night of ut july 22 , 2009 under dark conditions with typical seeing of @xmath32 .",
    "we obtained six dithered exposures of 360seconds in both the @xmath33- and @xmath34-bands centered on pal13 .",
    "a standard dithering pattern was used to cover both the small and large gaps present between chips .",
    "data from megacam were pre - processed prior to release using the  elixir \" package @xcite .",
    "this pre - process includes bad pixel masking , bias subtraction , flat fielding as well as preliminary photometric and astrometric solutions .",
    "we carried out subsequent data reduction following the method detailed in @xcite which relies on the daophot / allstar / allframe packages @xcite . to refine the astrometric solutions included in the image headers , we have used the scamp package @xcite using as reference the usno - b1 catalog , which yielded astrometric residuals of @xmath35 .",
    "photometric calibration is achieved by comparing directly to pal  13 data from the sdss - data release 8 ( dr8 ; * ? ? ? * ) . to determine zero points and color terms we used stars with magnitudes in the range @xmath36 and @xmath37 , providing @xmath38 matches between our catalog and sdss .",
    "final solutions for the zero points and color terms yield uncertainties of @xmath39mag and @xmath40mag , respectively , for both passbands .",
    "our photometric catalog reaches 90% completeness at @xmath41 .      using our cfht / megacam catalog , we recalculated structural parameters for pal13 using a maximum likelihood method as described in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a fixed analytic profile is assumed and its free parameters are fit using all the available stars in the cmd ( color - magnitude diagram ) selection window .",
    "this avoids the need to bin or smooth data , providing more reliable estimates for systems with low numbers of stars @xcite .",
    "we simultaneously estimated the scale length , the central coordinates , the ellipticity , the position angle and the background density of pal13 .",
    "we assumed an empirical king profile @xcite , for which we calculated a king core ( @xmath42 ) and tidal ( @xmath43 ) radius .",
    "we additionally fit a nfw @xcite and a plummer profile @xcite , a good representation for dwarf galaxies , but found that these were poor fits to the light distribution shape of pal13 .",
    "the best - fitting king parameters are @xmath44 ( @xmath45pc ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath47pc ) .",
    "the two - dimensional half - light radius of this king profile is @xmath48 ( @xmath49pc ) .",
    "the overall ellipticity of pal  13 is consistent with being zero and therefore its position angle is poorly constrained .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig_profile ] , we show the projected density profile for pal13 , overplotting our best - fit king profile .",
    "error bars on the data points include uncertainty in determining the background level which dominates outside @xmath50 .",
    "we emphasize that the king profile shown is not a direct fit to the data points , but constructed with the best fit parameters obtained through the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "we compared our best fitting king profile to that determined in c02 .",
    "if we parameterize the outer slope of the surface brightness profile as @xmath51 , then typical globular clusters have slopes of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "we measure a shallow slope for pal13 of @xmath53 .",
    "this is consistent with our inferred king tidal radius which is two times larger than the calculated tidal radius of pal13 based on its stellar mass and distance from the milky way ( see  [ sec_membership ] ) .",
    "our inferred slope is steeper than the c02 estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "these two profiles are compared in figure  [ fig_profile ] .",
    "a key difference between the two king profiles is the cmd region in which they were determined .",
    "while c02 determined the profile using stars inside a box in cmd space , we have used a window around the best - fitting isochrone . at faint magnitudes , there is significant contamination from unresolved galaxies , and our cmd window should reduce this contamination .",
    "in the right panel of figure  [ fig_profile ] , we show the spatial density map of pal13 .",
    "the outer isophotes in this figure are @xmath55 contours above the background , corresponding to @xmath5630 mag arcsec@xmath57 . the red dashed line / circle in both panels of figure  [ fig_profile ] are drawn at the king tidal radius @xmath58 ( 98pc ) .",
    "the photometric isophotes are regular out to the half - light radius of the cluster , and appear mildly irregular outside this radius .",
    "this is in contrast to other faint globular clusters such as palomar  1 and palomar  5 which show evidence for tidal tails at much brighter surface brightness levels @xcite , although similar to that observed for palomar  14 @xcite .",
    "we interpret the slightly irregular isophotes and shallow density profile as mild evidence for tidal disruption and discuss further in  [ sec_discussion ] .",
    "finally , we estimated the total luminosity of pal13 .",
    "the published values for pal13 range between @xmath59 and @xmath60l@xmath61 @xcite , making traditional methods of adding stars individual fluxes too sensitive to the inclusion ( or exclusion ) of potential members ( outliers ) . to alleviate these shot noise issues ,",
    "the method used here relies solely on the total number of stars belonging to the satellite and not on their individual magnitudes @xcite . to estimate an absolute magnitude",
    ", we modelled the satellite s population with the best - fitting theoretical luminosity function , in this case a @xmath29gyr population with [ fe / h]@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "we then integrated the theoretical luminosity function to obtain the total flux down to a given magnitude limit .",
    "the last step was to scale this flux using the total number of pal13 stars in our catalog down to the same magnitude limit . to estimate the uncertainty in the absolute magnitude we carried out a bootstrap analysis generating @xmath63 realizations of pal  13 from the photometric data ( for more details",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "we assumed a chabrier initial mass function for the estimation @xcite .",
    "we obtained @xmath64 , or equivalently @xmath65l@xmath61 .",
    "the central surface brightness is @xmath66mag arcs@xmath57 . while our results are one sigma lower than published values , it is a more robust estimate of the true luminosity of pal13 as it better accounts for shot noise in this quantity .",
    "we compare the size and luminosity of pal13 to other milky way stellar systems in figure  [ fig_sizemv ] .",
    "we list our measured properties of pal13 and those of c02 in table  2 for comparison .",
    "the systemic velocity of pal13 lies within the velocity distribution of foreground milky way stars .",
    "we therefore selected spectroscopic members of pal13 by combining color - magnitude and velocity criteria with proper motion information from the literature .",
    "we first applied a color - magnitude selection window shown in figure  [ fig_cmd_spat ] .",
    "cmd selection was performed using a 12gyr , [ fe / h ] = @xmath67 @xcite isochrone in the cfht photometric system , shown in figure  [ fig_full_cmd ] to fit pal13 .",
    "the selection window was defined as 0.1mag around this isochrone added in quadrature to the 2-@xmath68 photometric errors .",
    "the cmd selection window does not include blue straggler stars which are abundant in pal13 @xcite .",
    "we selected blue stragglers separately by defining a generous window bluer and brighter than the main sequence turnoff , but dimmer than the horizontal branch ( figure  [ fig_cmd_spat ] ) .",
    "stars in the blue straggler window are removed from all analysis below unless specified .",
    "we study the blue straggler population separately in ",
    "[ sec_blues ] .    after the cmd selection , we applied a basic velocity cut to the sample .",
    "we chose a conservative velocity window of 10-@xmath68 around the systemic velocity as measured by c02 .",
    "we use the velocity dispersion measured by c02 of @xmath69 km  s@xmath1 , thus our velocity window corresponds to @xmath70 km  s@xmath1  around the systemic velocity of @xmath71 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "combined with stars passing the cmd cut , this leaves 93 member candidates of pal13 .    milky way foreground stars are expected to contaminate our cmd and velocity selected sample . using the besanon model of the milky way @xcite",
    ", we applied the same selection criteria and predict 5 to 7 foreground stars in our sample of 93 pal13 members , depending on details of normalizing the model to data .",
    "a maximum of 6 of these possible 7 foreground stars are predicted in the thin and thick disk , and 1 in the halo .",
    "a method to identify foreground stars is via metallicity , since the average [ fe / h ] of pal13 is significantly lower than expected for the majority of foreground milky way disk stars (  [ subsec_metal ] ) . as explained in ",
    "[ subsec_metal ] , we can measure metallicities for only the 20 brightest stars in our sample . as seen in figure  [ fig_metals ] ,",
    "four stars are far more metal - rich compared to the main sample .",
    "three stars are at very large radius from pal13 where the contamination is greatest .",
    "we reject these four stars as members , leaving 89 candidate pal13 stars in our full sample .",
    "another way to identify foreground stars is via proper motions .",
    "proper motions are available for 69 out of 89 candidate members ( 78% ) from @xcite .",
    "three stars in this sample have large proper motions that are inconsistent with being cluster members ( assigned 0% membership probabilities by siegel  et  al . ) , and we eliminate them from our sample .",
    "this leaves 66 candidate member stars of pal13 .",
    "we defined this sample of 66 stars as our cleaned pal13 sample , and proceed with analysis on these stars .",
    "we can not be certain the cleaned sample is free of milky way contamination , but estimate from the besanon models that there is likely less than one foreground star given our sample criteria .",
    "the results of this selection are shown in figure  [ fig_vel_vvsr ] .",
    "tidal heating or evaporation processes will unbind stars from the gravitational potential of pal13 .",
    "these stars can be a source of contamination if they remain in the spatial vicinity of the cluster and would not be rejected by our methods above @xcite .",
    "while the three stars at largest radius passing our cmd and velocity cuts are prime candidates for unbound pal13 stars , these were rejected based on their high metallicity and are more likely to be milky way foreground stars .    to estimate at what projected radius stars are likely to be unbound from pal13 , we calculate the jacobi tidal radius assuming a galactocentric distance of 25.3kpc and a milky way mass inside this radius of @xmath72 .",
    "the jacobi tidal radius of pal13 is @xmath73 ( 47pc ) , larger than the half - light radius of the cluster @xmath74 , but smaller than the inferred king tidal radius of @xmath75 , as noted previously by c02 , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the jacobi radius provides only a very approximate estimate of the tidal radius @xcite , this suggests that stars in the outskirts of pal13 may not be bound to the cluster .",
    "this calculation assumes a circular orbit .",
    "stars in our clean kinematic sample are located well inside the jacobi tidal radius , while our full sample contains two stars beyond this distance .",
    "we obtained numerous repeated velocity measurements of stars in pal13 in order to investigate the frequency of unresolved binary stars and their influence on the velocity dispersion .",
    "we measured two or more velocities for 62 out of 306 total ( 36 out of 89 member ) stars .",
    "we further fold in historical data from c02 , taken ten years prior to our deimos observations , providing multiple measurements for 72 out of 306 total ( 42 out of 89 member ) stars .",
    "we list both deimos and hires velocity measurements in table  3 .",
    "binary fractions inferred from our data are necessarily lower limits on the true binary fraction and are most sensitive towards short ( few day ) periods , but also include one year to ten year periods depending on the available data .",
    "we also note that the repeated stars are heavily biased towards bright magnitudes .    using the error - normalized velocity difference plotted in figure  [ fig_hist_hist ] , we define a star to be variable if individual independent measurements are more than @xmath55 discrepant in this quantity .",
    "we acknowledge that the number of identified binaries depends sensitively on this choice .",
    "we find that 5 out of 89 in our full member sample are velocity variables ( 6% ) .",
    "these 5 stars are also contained in our cleaned sample .",
    "given the large velocity differences ( a few to tens of km  s@xmath1 ) , we assume these systems are unresolved binary stars , as single variable stars are unlikely to be in this region of color - magnitude space .",
    "as expected , the fraction of binary stars identified in our incomplete sample is far less than @xmath76% measured by @xcite , but does provide spectroscopic confirmation that unresolved binary stars exist in pal13 .    for all stars with multiple measurements , we use the error - weighted mean velocity in the calculations below . because we are measuring the five binary stars at a random points in their orbits , it is not guaranteed that this will be the true systemic velocity of the star .",
    "we will therefore calculate , in ",
    "[ sec_vel_disp ] , the velocity dispersion of pal13 with and without the 5 identified binary systems .",
    "the velocity dispersion of pal13 measured by c02 of @xmath77 km  s@xmath1  is significantly larger than that predicted based on the stellar mass alone of @xmath78 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "if this velocity dispersion accurately traces the motion of stars in a gravitational potential , it implies over 95% of mass in pal13 is not luminous , i.e.  that pal13 has a significant dark matter component .",
    "we measured keck / deimos velocities for all 21 stars in the keck / hires c02  sample and , in most cases , have multiple measurements separated by up to one year .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we determine dispersions using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method @xcite assuming uniform priors on the velocity and velocity dispersion .",
    "this method produces the same results as the likelihood maximization technique described in @xcite when the error distributions are gaussian . in the regime where the velocity dispersion approaches the observational errors on this quantity ,",
    "the mcmc method allows us to calculate confidence intervals directly from posterior distributions without the assumption of gaussianity .",
    "we confirmed that our mcmc algorithm reproduces the same dispersion and errors reported by c02 for their hires dataset .",
    "using a single epoch of velocities and the 21 star sample defined in c02 , we measured a keck / deimos velocity dispersion of @xmath79 km  s@xmath1 , in good agreement with the keck / hires measurement .",
    "we next combined our 47 independent measurements of these 21 stars ( six stars have only a single measured velocity , while 3 stars have four or more epochs ) , and redetermine the velocity dispersion . combining our repeat measurements",
    ", we find a lower velocity dispersion of @xmath80 km  s@xmath1 , suggesting that unresolved binary stars are indeed inflating the single epoch dispersion , although not to a level consistent with the stellar mass alone .",
    "we next examined the c02  stars for evidence of variability .",
    "there are two stars in this sample which we suspect , ors-38 and ors-91 , identified as orange symbols in figure  [ fig_cmd_spat ] .",
    "ors-38 is near the rgb and varies in velocity by 17 km  s@xmath1  between the deimos and hires measurements .",
    "this is one of the five variables identified in  [ sec_bin_pop ] .",
    "while it does not inflate the hires velocity dispersion , ors-38 is the primary star inflating our calculations .",
    "ors-91 is on the horizontal branch and lies in the instability band identified in @xcite .",
    "although the deimos and hires velocities agree , and including / removing this stars does not affect our results , we chose to exclude this and other horizontal branch stars from our sample . removing ors-38 and ors-91",
    "does not affect the hires - determined dispersion , but the deimos - based velocity dispersion falls to @xmath81 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this dispersion is consistent with a normal stellar mass - to - light ratio , although our measurement uncertainties are too large to rule out a higher than expected mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we plot the error - normalized differences in velocity between the hires and deimos samples in figure  [ fig_hist_hist ] , noting the position of these two rejected stars .",
    "we determine the velocity dispersion of pal13 first using the cleaned sample of 66 stars defined above .",
    "this sample has minimal milky way foreground contamination and contains 5 known velocity variable stars . using only a single epoch of deimos observations",
    ", we calculate a dispersion of @xmath82 km  s@xmath1 . using a weighted average of all our repeat measurements ,",
    "the velocity dispersion decreases to @xmath83 km  s@xmath1 . by removing the 5 known variable stars , the velocity dispersion drops close to our measurable limits : @xmath84 km  s@xmath1 . finally , adding in quadrature measurements from c02 where available , the velocity dispersion of pal13 is @xmath85 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these results demonstrate that unresolved binaries or variables , even multiply measured and averaged , can still contribute significantly to the dispersion given our sample size .",

    ", however , splitting the sample at the radius enclosing half the measured stars , we find that both the inner and outer bin have similar velocity dispersions , but the error on each value doubles .",
    "we calculate the mass and mass - to - light ratio of pal13 using the velocity dispersion determined via our 61 member clean sample without binary stars , @xmath88 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we determine the dynamical mass enclosed within the half - light radius applying the formula from @xcite : @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the mass contained within the 3d projected half - light radius , @xmath91 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "this mass estimator is based on the jeans equation and is less sensitive to uncertainties in the velocity anisotropy than other simple mass estimates .",

    "since pal13 is slightly more metal - poor than the average milky way globular cluster in this sample , we computed the theoretical mass - to - light ratio , based on a chabrier initial mass function , an age of 12gyr and [ fe / h ] @xmath62 @xcite to be @xmath101 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the dynamics of pal13 are consistent with its stellar mass alone .",
    "we measured spectroscopic metallicities for individual stars in pal13 using the spectral synthesis method introduced by @xcite and refined by @xcite .",
    "metallicities based on this method are reliable for stars with log@xmath102 ( at the distance of pal13 roughly @xmath103 ) . in figure  [ fig_metals ] , we plot metallicities of the 20 stars passing this criterion in our full sample . as discussed in  [ sec_membership ] , four stars have clearly deviant metallicities from the main sample and we have excluded these stars from pal13 membership .",
    "the weighted average metallicity for the 16 member stars is @xmath104[fe / h]@xmath105 = @xmath106dex .",
    "this is comparable to previous spectroscopic estimates of the metallicity based on medium resolution spectroscopy , [ fe / h ] = @xmath107 @xcite and [ fe / h ] = @xmath108 , @xcite , as well as [ fe / h ] = @xmath109dex based on a single pal13 star observed at high resolution @xcite .",
    "using the same sample of 16 stars above , we estimated an internal metallicity dispersion of @xmath110dex . while the one - sigma errors are consistent with no internal metallicity dispersion , as expected for a single stellar population globular cluster , the measurement does allow a modest metallicity dispersion .",
    "this dispersion is smaller than observed in some luminous globular clusters ( e.g. , ngc  2419 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is significantly smaller than observed for stellar systems containing dark matter , e.g.  dwarf galaxies , show clear metallicity dispersions on the order of 0.5dex @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies also exhibit a tight correlation between luminosity and metallicity @xcite .",
    "given pal13 s low luminosity ( @xmath111 ) , this relationship predicts a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath112 , significantly more metal - poor than observed .",
    "both the average metallicity of pal13 and the low internal metallicity dispersion are further evidence that pal13 is a globular cluster .",
    "we show above that the dynamics of pal13 are influenced by the presence of unresolved binary stars .",
    "this is unlike other milky way globular clusters whose single - epoch velocity dispersions are consistent with their stellar mass @xcite .",
    "we next investigate the blue straggler stars ( bsss ) population of pal13 as a means to determine whether the binary fraction in pal13 is indeed higher than typical globular clusters .",
    "bsss are positioned brighter and blueward of the primary main - sequence turnoff . in globular clusters ,",
    "bsss mimic a younger stellar population , but are interpreted as systems which formed via stellar collisions @xcite or mass transfer in close binary systems @xcite .",
    "we have not included bsss in our kinematic analysis , however , our spectroscopic observations of these stars provide some clue to their formation , and their frequency provides further evidence for an enhanced binary fraction in pal13 .    in our spectroscopic sample , 12 stars",
    "pass the bss criterion in color - magnitude ( figure  [ fig_cmd_spat ] ) .",
    "two of these stars do not pass our velocity criterion for membership , and their proper motions measured by @xcite confirm they are not pal13 members .",
    "the remaining ten stars have proper motions consistent with pal13 membership .",
    "we obtained repeated velocity measurements for only one member star ; the repeat measurements are consistent with a constant velocity",
    ". however , the velocity distribution of the 10 stars identified as bss members of pal13 is broader than the overall velocity distribution of pal13 .",
    "this is reflected in the velocity dispersion of the bsss , @xmath113 km  s@xmath1 substantially larger than the main pal13 sample .",
    "this hints that at least some of these bsss may be close binary systems .",
    "a common way to express the bss abundance is by measuring the ratio , of bsss to rgb stars , @xmath114 .",
    "using our cfht photometric data , we estimated the frequency ( @xmath114 ) of bsss following the method of @xcite by counting the number of bsss and rgb stars within well defined regions of the cmd .",
    "these regions are similar to leigh & sills , with the main difference being our bss box is located closer to the main sequence turnoff .",
    "the reason for this is that pal13 is a low density cluster and overcrowding near the center is not an issue and , therefore , the scatter in the main sequence is lower .",
    "we measured @xmath114 in both a region within the half - light radius ( @xmath115 ) and three times this value obtaining @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "our results are directly comparable to the values of @xmath114 determined by @xcite for 57 milky way globular clusters ( their sample did not include pal13 ) .",
    "these authors found an average value of @xmath118 with a standard deviation of 0.19 . in comparison",
    ", pal13 presents a remarkably high frequency of bsss .",
    "given the binary fraction measured by @xcite of @xmath76% based on stars redwards of the main sequence , the high frequency of bsss can be interpreted as due to mass transfer between primordial binaries .",
    "the high bss frequency is consistent with pal13 having a higher binary fraction than typical milky way globulars .",
    "we demonstrate that the mass - to - light ratio of the milky way globular cluster pal13 is consistent with its stellar mass , based on deep cfht / megacam imaging and keck / deimos spectroscopy .",
    "our spectroscopic member sample is triple that of previous studies , consisting of 61 stars with multiply measured velocities on the timescale of days and years .",
    "we have minimized contamination from milky way foreground stars via proper motion estimates from @xcite , and removed unresolved binary stars when possible via multiple spectroscopic measurements . when combined with hires velocities from c02 ,",
    "our final velocity dispersion for pal13 is @xmath119 km  s@xmath1 , corresponding to a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the dynamical mass of pal13 is consistent with its stellar mass and there is no need for dark matter .",
    "we therefore confirm the suggestion by @xcite that binaries inflate the single epoch velocity dispersion . while pal13 appears to be a normal globular cluster in this sense , two independent observed quantities in pal13",
    "are atypical : ( 1 ) unlike other milky way globular clusters , the single epoch velocity dispersion is higher than predicted based on the stellar mass alone , and ( 2 ) the surface brightness slope is shallower than typical globular clusters . we examine each of these statements below .",
    "the single epoch velocity dispersion of pal13 is inflated due to unresolved binary stars in both the hires data from c02 and our own deimos dataset .",
    "we arrive at our final dispersion by removing these binary systems .",
    "yet unresolved binaries do not affect the velocity dispersion of other milky way globular clusters @xcite , at least not to the same extent .",
    "thus , pal13 must have a higher binary fraction as compared to these globular clusters .",
    "estimates from the main sequence @xcite and blue straggler stars (  , [ sec_blues ] ; santana et al . ,  2012 ,  in prep ) are consistent with this statement .",
    "however , we are necessarily comparing pal13 s binary fraction to luminous and more concentrated globular clusters where such estimates exist .    a stellar mass - to - light ratio for pal13 does not provide an explanation for the second anomalous observations in pal13 , the observed shallow surface brightness ( @xmath121 ) , nor the large king tidal radius ( @xmath122pc ) which is significantly larger than the calculated jacobi tidal radius of 47pc .",
    "the half - light radius of pal13 ( @xmath123pc ) is larger than the average milky way cluster , as well as the median size of globular clusters in external galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pal13 may be a galactic analog of the `` diffuse star clusters '' seen in some other galaxies @xcite .",
    "the photometric isophotes of pal13 ( figure  [ fig_profile ] ) show some irregularity near the jacobi radius , but we do not observe the well defined s - shape curve seen in other globular clusters which are actively being tidally stripped . while pal13 may not currently be undergoing tidal heating ( e.g.  lack of s - curve in photometry , low velocity dispersion ) , tidal debris in the vicinity of the cluster may influence its appearance .",
    "@xcite proposed that pal13 is at apogalacticon ( farthest approach ) , and the photometric properties can be explained by tidal debris stripped from the cluster throughout its orbit and compressed . confirming whether the photometric features of pal13 are intrinsic or due to tidal interactions may be tested by future studies that consist of measuring velocities and metallicities of stars at larger radius then the present sample , particularly between the predicted and king tidal radius ( @xmath124 ) of pal13 .    while the large inferred radii of pal13 may be due to tidal interactions ,",
    "its present luminosity and size are currently more closely related to the dark matter dominated milky way ultra - faint galaxies ( figure  [ fig_sizemv ] ) .",
    "is it possible that the ultra - faint galaxies are also affected by tidal interactions or binary stars , and that these objects may instead have mass - to - light more similar to globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this exercise has been done for the ultra - faint galaxies segue1 @xcite and bootesi @xcite , whose velocities dispersions are between 2 - 4 km  s@xmath1 . in both cases ,",
    "the binary - corrected velocity dispersions are still consistent with a significant dark matter content .",
    "furthermore , both galaxies have a more significant spread in metallicities as compared to pal13 .",
    "thus , both the corrected velocity dispersions and metallicities suggest that the ultra - faint galaxies are distinct from low luminosity globular clusters such as pal13 .",
    "the dynamical mass of pal13 inferred from the binary - corrected velocity dispersion is consistent with its stellar mass alone .",
    "however , the large influence of unresolved binaries on the velocity dispersion , as well as high inferred blue straggler population makes pal13 a unique system .",
    "in addition pal13 has an unusual density structure suggesting that tidal interaction may be important in this low - mass halo object .",
    "studying other low luminosity globular clusters in the milky way halo and beyond will answer whether these properties are unique to pal13 or are typical properties of low luminosity globular clusters .",
