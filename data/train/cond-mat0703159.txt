    "the peculiar dielectric properties are caused by a wide dielectric relaxation which broadens and slows down on cooling.@xcite the relaxation originates from the dynamics of polar clusters , which develop below the burns temperature t@xmath11 620k.@xcite the broad distribution of relaxation frequencies has its origin in random fields and random forces as a consequence of chemical disorder in the perovskite b sites occupied by mg@xmath12 and nb@xmath13 .",
    "the local ferroelectric instability in the polar clusters was indicated by an unstable polar optic phonon , which softens to t@xmath14 and hardens above t@xmath14.@xcite although the dielectric properties of perovskite pbmg@xmath7nb@xmath8o@xmath9 were intensively studied during the last fifty years , not all is completely understood , particularly the complex and broad dielectric dispersion .",

    "the only report known to the authors is that by shrout and swartz.@xcite they investigated the dielectric response up to 400khz down to liquid he temperatures and observed a diffuse maximum in the complex permittivity below 40@xmath5 .",
    "the crystal structure of the pyrochlore pmn single crystal ( @xmath15 space group ) was determined in detail by wakiya et al.@xcite high - frequency dielectric properties , including microwave , thz and infrared frequencies , have not been investigated , although they could be useful for understanding the reported diffused and frequency dependent maximum of the complex permittivity .",
    "the present report aims to fill this gap in the literature .",
    "we will show that our pyrochlore pmn ceramics does not undergo a diffuse phase transition ( reported in ref .",

    "the pyrochlore cubic structure was verified by the x - ray diffraction .",
    "the dielectric response was investigated between 400 hz and 1 mhz from 10@xmath5 to 730@xmath5 using an impedance analyzer hp 4192a .",
    "the te@xmath19 composite dielectric resonator method@xcite and network analyzer agilent e8364b was used for microwave measurements at 8.8 ghz in 100 - 350@xmath5 temperature interval .",

    "measurements at teraherz ( thz ) frequencies from 7@xmath20 to 33 @xmath20 ( 0.2 - 1.0thz ) were performed in the transmission mode using a time - domain thz spectrometer based on an amplified ti - sapphire femtosecond laser system .",
    "two znte crystal plates were used to generate ( by optic rectification ) and to detect ( by electro - optic sampling ) the thz pulses .",
    "both the transmitted field amplitude and phase shift were simultaneously measured ; this allows us to determine directly the complex dielectric response @xmath21 .",
    "an optistat cf cryostat with thin mylar windows ( oxford inst . ) was used for measurements down to 10@xmath5 .",
    "infrared ( ir ) reflectivity spectra were obtained using a fourier transform ir spectrometer bruker ifs 113v in the frequency range of 20 - 3000 @xmath20 ( 0.6 - 90 thz ) at room temperature , at lower temperatures the reduced spectral range up to 650 @xmath20 only was studied ( transparency region of polyethylene windows in the cryostat ) .",
    "pyroelectric deuterated triglicine sulfate detectors were used for the room temperature measurements , while more sensitive liquid - he - cooled ( 1.5 k ) si bolometer was used for the low - temperature measurements .",
    "polished disk - shaped samples with a diameter of 8 mm and thickness of @xmath42 mm were investigated .",
    "temperature dependence of the real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity @xmath22 at various frequencies is plotted in fig .",
    "one can see typical incipient ferroelectric behavior , i.e. increase in @xmath23 on cooling and its noticeble saturation at low temperatures .",
    "it is important to stress that within the accuracy of measurements no frequency dispersion of @xmath24 was observed between 400hz and 8.8ghz at temperatures below 600@xmath5 .",
    "the small low - frequency dispersion above 600@xmath5 is caused by non - negligible conductivity of our sample .",
    "the pronounced @xmath23(t ) dependence is therefore caused by the softening of an excitation above 10ghz . to reveal it we measured the thz dielectric spectra ( see fig .",

    "parameters of the fits performed at 300 and 20@xmath5 are summarized in table i. one can see a higher number of observed modes at 20@xmath5 than at rt .",
    "this is due to the reduced phonon damping at low temperatures , which allows to resolve a higher number of modes , which are probably overlapping at rt .",
    "one can see in the @xmath23(@xmath33 ) spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( we remind that the frequencies of @xmath23  maxima roughly correspond to the phonon frequencies ) that the most remarkable frequency shift with temperature is revealed by the lowest frequency mode below 30@xmath37 , but also the mode near 130@xmath37 partially softens on cooling .",
    "the temperature dependence of the soft mode frequency @xmath38(left scale ) and its dielectric strength @xmath39 are shown in fig .",
    "mainly this mode causes an increase in @xmath24 on cooling ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in the case of uncoupled phonons",
    "the oscillator strength @xmath40 of each phonon is roughly temperature independent so that each softening of phonon frequency @xmath27 is connected with the increase of its dielectric strength @xmath41 given by:@xcite @xmath42 in our case the soft - mode oscillator strength @xmath43 is temperature dependent , it increases twice from 3.3 .10@xmath10 to 6.5 .10@xmath10 @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that the soft mode is coupled with some higher frequency mode assuming that @xmath45 .",
    "however , it is difficult to reveal with which mode is the soft mode coupled , because the oscillator strength of the most high - frequency modes is much higher than @xmath43 and relatively small changes ( below the limit of our fitting accuracy ) in these modes could explain the increase of the @xmath43 on cooling .

    "we believe that the small dispersion below 50@xmath5 and small decrease in @xmath23 below @xmath4 30@xmath5 observed by shrout and swartz@xcite could be due to some defects ( e.g. vacancies ) in the crystal lattice of pyrochlore pb@xmath0mg@xmath1nb@xmath2o@xmath3 , which is substantially non - stoichiometric .",
    "it is clear that the soft mode frequency can not follow the cochran law ( eq .  [ cochran ] ) in the case of low - temperature quantum fluctuations .",

    "let us compare the ir reflectivity spectra of pyrochlore pmn ( fig .",

    "n_(t ) , which shows deviation from the linear dependence below @xmath4 600@xmath5 .",
    "they explained the unusual _",
    "n_(t ) dependence by formation of polar nanoregions .",
    "surprisingly , the published ir spectrum of the perovskite sample @xcite corresponds to our pyrochlore spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in later papers of other authors ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) the mutually similar ( but different from burns and dacol s spectra@xcite ) ir reflectivity spectra of perovskite pmn consisted of three distinct reflection bands typical for all cubic perovskite oxides .",
    "we stress that the infrared spectra in refs .",
    "@xcite were obtained independently on ceramics , single crystals as well as on thin films .",
    "it appears that the ir spectrum by burns and dacol",
    "@xcite belongs to pyrochlore pmn .",
    "the rest of their data ( _ n_(t ) and _ p_(t ) ) were obviously obtained on perovskite pmn , because the peculiarities near the burns temperature in the perovskite pmn were later confirmed in many experiments .",
    "it is of interest to compare the number of observed polar modes in the reflectivity spectra with the prediction of factor - group analysis : pyrochlore pmn crystallizes in @xmath15 space group with 8 formula units per conventional unit cell,@xcite i.e. 2 formula units per primitive unit cell .",
    "this means that on the whole , 66 lattice vibrational branches are expected .",
    "pb ions are in 16d positions while mg and nb ions are in 16c positions @xcite , both sites having @xmath75 symmetry , while the o cations are in positions 48f and 8b of @xmath76 and @xmath77 symmetry , respectively . the mode symmetries and their activities in ir and raman spectra",
    "can be obtained using standard tables",
    "@xcite with the following result for the @xmath78-point of the brillouin zone ( factor - group analysis ) : @xmath79 it means that after subtraction of 1@xmath80 acoustic mode , 7@xmath80 modes should be ir active , 4@xmath81 , 1@xmath82 and 1@xmath83 should be raman active , the rest of modes being silent .",
    "table i shows that our fit of ir spectra required 17 modes , much more than expected .",
    "the analysis in eq .",
    "[ eq : pyro1 ] assumes one effective ion in 16c positions instead of statistically distributed mg and nb ions .",
    "since the ions strongly differ in the mass , one could expect splitting of the modes in which these ions take part .",
    "if we take into account different mg and nb vibrations , the factor group analysis yields : @xmath84 in this case 9 polar @xmath80 modes are expected , which is still less than 17 modes observed at low temperature ( see table i ) .",
    "if we assume that the pb cations and some of the oxygen anions are dynamically disordered among more equivalent positions with the avarage structure remaining cubic like in isostructural bi@xmath85znnb@xmath85o@xmath86,@xcite , then 14 modes could be ir active,@xcite close to our experimental result .",
    "the problem with the excess ir active modes is also known from the perovskite pmn , where only 4@xmath80 polar modes are allowed in @xmath87 structure , although 7 modes were observed.@xcite the excess modes in the perovskite pmn were explained by polar clusters , which locally break the cubic symmetry into a rhombohedral one.@xcite in the case of pyrochlore structure similar local symmetry breaking , if present , should probably be non - polar , because there is no indication for the existence of polar clusters .",
    "there is also no dielectric dispersion below the polar phonon range , in contrast to the pmn perovskite , where the huge dielectric dispersion appears just due to polar cluster dynamics.@xcite therefore it appears that new structural studies of pyrochlore pmn are needed to detect either a dynamical disorder of some atoms in the lattice or a non - cubic crystal symmetry .",
    "our dielectric studies of pyrochlore pmn indicate quantum paraelectric behavior , i.e. the permittivity increase on cooling following the barrett formula in the whole investigated temperature range .",
    "the permittivity shows no dispersion up to the microwave range and its temperature dependence can be explained by the softening of polar optic modes .",
    "the zero - point vibrational energy @xmath701thz obtained from the barrett formula corresponds very well to the soft mode frequency observed near 30@xmath37 .",
    "it is worth to note that the pyrochlore pmn is the first quantum paraelectrics with pyrochlore crystal structure .",
    "our ir spectrum of pyrochlore pmn corresponds to ir spectrum by burns and dacol@xcite , whose paper concerns the perovskite pmn . by comparing it with the later results,@xcite it becomes clear that burns and dacol published ( by mistake ) the ir spectrum of the pyrochlore pmn .",
    "since the ir experiment revealed more modes than expected from the factor - group analysis , we suggest that the structure should have at least locally lower symmetry than the cubic one .",
