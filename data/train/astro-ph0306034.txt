    "in order to build a chemical evolution model one needs to specify some basic parameters such as the boundary conditions , namely whether the system is closed or open and whether the gas is primordial or already chemically enriched . then the stellar birthate function , which is generally expressed as the product of two independent functions , the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the initial mass function ( imf ) , namely : @xmath0 where the sfr is assumed to be only a function of time and the imf only a function of the stellar mass .",
    "the stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis are also necessary ingredients for modelling chemical evolution and in particular we need to specify the stellar yields ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "then , one can include in the chemical evolution model some supplementary ingredients such as the the infall of extragalactic material , radial flows and galactic winds , which can play a more or less important role depending on the galactic system under study .",
    "in particular , gas infall and radial flows can be important in describing the chemical evolution of spiral disks , whereas galactic outflows are probably important in elliptical galaxies where the sfr was very high in the past and there is no cold gas at the present time , as well as in dwarf galaxies which possess a smaller potential well .",
    "in fact , galactic outflows , which eventually can transform into galactic winds , are determined by two main processes ; the supernova feedback , namely how much energy is transferred from sne into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and the galactic potential well .    in this paper , i will recall the most popular approximations used to describe both the basic and the supplementary ingredients involved in galactic chemical evolution",
    ". then i will describe detailed numerical models which can follow the evolution in space and time of the abundances of the most abundant chemical species .",
    "i will show some applications of such models to the milky way galaxy and then to galaxies of different morphological type , focussing on the fact that abundances and abundance ratios are very useful tools to infer the history of star formation in galaxies , to impose constraints on the stellar nucleosynthesis and to derive information on the nature and the age of high redshift objects .",
    "the sfr is one of the most important drivers of galactic chemical evolution : it describes the rate at which the gas is turned into stars in galaxies .",
    "since the physics of the star formation process is still not well known , several parametrizations are used to describe the sfr .",
    "a common aspect to the different formulations of the sfr is that they include a dependence upon the gas density .",
    "here i recall the most commonly used parametrizations for the sfr adopted so far in the literature .",
    "an exponentially decreasing sfr provides an easy to handle formula : @xmath2 with @xmath3 gyr in order to obtain a good fit to the properties of the solar neighbourhhood ( tosi , 1988 ) and @xmath4 , being the so - called efficiency of star formation which is expressed as the inverse of the timescale of star formation .    however , the most famous formulation and most widely adopted for the sfr is the schmidt ( 1955 ) law : @xmath5 which assumes that the sfr is proportional to some power of the volume or surface gas density .",
    "the exponent suggested by schmidt was @xmath6 but kennicutt ( 1998 ) suggested that the best fit to the observational data on spiral disks and starburst galaxies is obtained with an exponent @xmath7 .",
    "a more complex formulation , including a dependence also from the total surface mass density , which is induced by the sn feedback , was suggested by the observations of dopita & ryder ( 1994 ) who proposed the following formulation :          a similar law for the sfr taking into account star formation induced by spiral density waves was proposed by wyse & silk ( 1989 ) and it can be expressed as ( prantzos 2002 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the rotational velocity in the disk and r is the galactocentric distance .",
    "it is worth noting that the sfrs expressed by eqs .",
    "( 1.4 ) , ( 1.5 ) and ( 1.6 ) contain a stronger dependence on the radial properties of the disk than the simple schmidt law , and this characteristic is required to best fit the disk properties ( see next sections ) .",
    "more recently , multi - slope ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , ... ) expressions of the imf have been adopted since they are better describing the luminosity function of the main sequence stars in the solar vicinity ( scalo 1986 , 1998 ; kroupa et al .",
    "generally , the imf is assumed to be constant in space and time , with some exceptions such as the one suggested by larson ( 1998 ) , which adopts a variable slope : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is variable with time and associated to the jeans mass .",
    "the effects of a variable imf on the galactic disk properties have been studied by chiappini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who concluded that only a very `` ad hoc '' variation of the imf can reproduce the majority of observational constraints , thus favoring chemical evolution models with imf constant in space and time .",
    "depending on the galactic system , the infall rate can be assumed to be constant in space and time , or more realistically the infall rate can be variable in space and time : @xmath22 with @xmath23 constant or varying along the disk .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is derived by fitting the present time total surface mass density in the disk of the galaxy , @xmath25 .",
    "otherwise , for the formation of the galaxy one can assume two independent episodes of infall during which the halo and perhaps part of the thick - disk formed first and then the thin - disk , respectively : @xmath26 as in the two - infall model of chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . here",
    "@xmath27 is the timescale for the formation of the halo / thick disk and @xmath28 is the timescale for the formation of the thin - disk .",
    "this latter is assumed to increase linearly with galactocentric distance ( matteucci & franois 1989 ; chiappini et al .",
    "1997 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ) . for the rate of gas outflow or galactic wind",
    "there are no specific prescriptions but",
    "generally one simply assumes that the wind rate is proportional to the star formation rate through a suitable parameter ( hartwick , 1976 ; matteucci & chiosi , 1983 ) : @xmath29 with @xmath30 being a free parameter .        under the assumption of instantaneous recycling approximation ( i.r.a .",
    ") we define the yield per stellar generation of a given element @xmath31 as ( tinsley , 1980 ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the stellar yield of the element @xmath31 , namely the newly formed and ejected mass fraction of the element @xmath31 by a star of initial mass @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth noting that the expression ( 1.13 ) is an oversemplification and it does not have much meaning when considering chemical elements formed on long timescales .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is the returned fraction : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the remnant mass of a star of mass m. in the past ten years a large number of calculations of the stellar yields , @xmath33 , has become available for stars of all masses and metallicities .",
    "however , uncertainties in stellar yields are still present especially in the yields of fe - peak elements .",
    "this is due to uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates , treatment of convection , mass cut , explosion energies , neutron fluxes and possible fall - back of matter on the proto - neutron star .",
    "moreover , the @xmath38n nucleosynthesis and its primary and/or secondary nature are still under debate .",

    "we show a comparison between the yields , produced in massive stars , of two @xmath43-elements ( o and mg ) and fe , respectively , as predicted by different authors . as is evident from fig .",
    "1.1 the o yields from different sources seem to be in good agreement with one another .",
    "the yields of mg , especially the most recent ones seem to be also in good agreement with each others , whereas for the yields of fe ( figure 1.2 ) there is not yet an agreement among different authors .",
    "observational estimates of fe produced in type ii sne ( elmhamdi et al .",
    "2003 ) can help in constraining the fe yields in massive stars .",
    "the simplest model of galactic chemical evolution is the so - called _ simple model _ for the evolution of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we define the solar neighbourhood or solar vicinity as a cylinder centered in the sun with 1 kpc radius .",
    "* the system is one - zone and closed , no inflows or outflows * the initial gas is primordial ( no metals ) * the instantaneous recycling approximation holds ( i.r.a . ) * @xmath46 is constant in time and space * the gas is well mixed at any time ( i.m.a . )    let @xmath47 be the abundance of an element @xmath31 and @xmath48 the ratio between the mass of gas and the total mass of the system .",
    "if @xmath49 , which is generally true for metals , then we can write :      which is the well known solution for the simple model , where @xmath51 is the yield per stellar generation as defined in eq . ( 1.13 ) .",
    "in particular , the yield appearing in eq .",
    "( 1.15 ) is usually referred to as the _ effective yield_. if @xmath47 is not much lower than 1 , as is the case for @xmath52 ( maeder 1992 ) , a more precise expression for the solution of the simple model is given by : @xmath53    it is worth noting that generally , in i.r.a .",
    ", we can assume : @xmath54 namely that the abundance ratios are equivalent to the yield ratios , and this holds also in analytical models with infall and/or outflow .",
    "clearly , eq . ( 1.17 ) can be used safely only for elements produced on short timescales , such as @xmath43-elements , but it fails if applied to elements produced on long timescales such as fe and n. these days the simple model is rarely used in describing the chemical evolution of the milky way since it does not reproduce the g - dwarf metallicity distribution ( the g - dwarf problem ) as well as the elements produced on long timescales such as fe ( matteucci , 2001 ) .      in the last years a great number of models relaxing i.r.a",
    ". and the closed box assumption but retaining the constancy of the imf and the i.m.a . , have appeared in the literature . as an example of the basic equations adopted in such models",

    "the snia rate should be based on the existing theories on sn ia progenitors which i will summarize in the next section . in the equations above the type ia sne",

    "the single degenerate scenario * is the classical scenario originally proposed by whelan and iben ( 1973 ) , namely c - deflagration in a c - o wd reaching the chandrasekhar mass limit , @xmath67 , after accreting material from a red giant companion .",
    "the progenitors of c - o wds lie in the range 0.8 - 8.0@xmath68 , therefore , the most massive binary system of two c - o wds is the 8@xmath68 + 8 @xmath68 one .",
    "the clock of the system in this scenario is provided by the lifetime of the secondary star ( i.e. the less massive one in the binary system).this implies that the minimum timescale for the appearence of the first type ia sne is the lifetime of the most massive secondary star . in this case the time is @xmath69=0.03 gyr ( greggio and renzini 1983a ; matteucci & greggio , 1986 ; matteucci & recchi , 2001 ) .    *",
    "the double degenerate scenario * consists in the merging of two c - o wds , due to loss of angular momentum occuring as a consequence of gravitational wave radiation , which then explode by c - deflagration when the @xmath70 is reached ( iben and tutukov 1984 ) . in this case",
    "the minimum timescale for the appearence of type ia sne is the lifetime of the most massive secondary star plus the gravitational time delay which depends on the original separation of the two wds and which is computed according to landau & lifschitz ( 1962 ) , namely @xmath71=0.03 + 0.15 gyr ( tornamb ` e & matteucci , 1986 ) .",
    "we recall that the gravitational time delay can be as long as several hubble times .    * the model by hachisu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) * is based on the classical scenario of whelan & iben ( 1973 ) but with a metallicity effect implying that no type ia systems can form for [ fe / h]@xmath72dex in the ism .",
    "this implies a much longer time delay for the first type ia sne to occur , also because the maximum masses of the secondary stars in the binary systems are assumed to be @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath74 gyr + metallicity delay due to the chemical evolution of the considered system . in this scenario , type ia sne are not associated with young stellar populations contrary to what is suggested by a recent search for sne ia in starburst galaxies ( see mannucci et al .",
    "2003 ) , which seem to favor the scenario where the progenitors of type ia sne can be as high as 8@xmath68 .    clearly , @xmath69 is a very important parameter for computing galactic chemical evolution since the abundance patterns will depend strongly on this timescale , although the most important timescale is the one for which the type ia sne have an impact on the abundances of the ism . in succesful models of galactic chemical evolution of the solar vicinity",
    "this timescale is 1.0 - 1.5 gyr in the framework of the single degenerate model ( matteucci & greggio , 1986 ) . in the other two scenarios this time is longer , especially in the one including the metallicity effect and it varies with different histories of star formation(see matteucci & recchi 2001 and sect .",

    "on this basis we can interpret all the observed abundance ratios plotted as functions of metallicity .",

    "we show the standard case in which both the contributions to fe enrichment from type ii and ia are taken into account as well as the cases where only one type of sn at the time is assumed to contribute to fe enrichment .",

    "2001 ) predict a steepening of the abundance gradients , in agreement with results from chemo - dynamical models ( samland et al .",
    "the difference between the two different approaches assumed by the various authors could perhaps reside in the different star formation and/or infall laws adopted for the galactic disk ( see tosi , 2000 for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "data from planetary nebulae ( pne ) of different ages can help in solving this problem ; recently maciel et al . (",
    "2002 ) suggested a flattening of the gradients with time . in any case , all the models predict a very small evolution in the last 5 gyr .",
    "it is very important to understand that different histories of star formation determine the abundance patterns in galaxies .",
    "in particular , the [ @xmath47/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations are strongly influenced by the sfr which influences the temporal growth of the fe abundance .",
    "in other words , the time - delay model coupled with different sf histories implies different timescales for the bulk of fe production from type ia sne , thus producing different [ @xmath43/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations in different objects .",
    "the typical timescale for type ia sn enrichment can be defined as the time when the sn ia rate reaches the maximum @xmath92 ( matteucci & recchi 2001 ) .",
    "this timescale depends upon the progenitor lifetimes , the imf and the sfr . for an elliptical galaxy or a bulge of a spiral with high sfr the maximum in the type ia sn rate",
    "is reached at @xmath93 gyr , whereas for a spiral like the milky way a first maximum in the snia rate is reached at @xmath94 gyr and a second maximum , if one uses the two - infall model , at @xmath95 gyr . therefore , for the milky way 1 - 1.5",
    "gyr is the time at which sne ia are no more negligible in the process of chemical enrichment and it corresponds to the change in slope observed in the [ el / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations ( figure 1.4 ) and to the end of the halo phase . for an irregular galaxy , where the sfr is assumed to proceed more slowly than in the solar vicinity the timescale for sn ia enrichment is @xmath96 gyr .",
    "therefore , it is worth repeating that the @xmath92 is different in different galaxies , since often in the literature it is adopted a universal timescale of 1 gyr ! on the basis of that we expect that objects where the sfr proceeds very fast such as in the spheroids ( bulges and ellipticals ) , the [ @xmath43/fe ] ratio stays flat for a larger metallicity interval than in systems with slower star formation such as the milky way , and that eventually the [ @xmath43/fe ] ratios in irregulars , where the star formation rate has been less efficient than in spiral , decreases almost continuously , as shown in figure 1.7 .",
    "the models shown in figure 1.7 contain the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions and differ for the star formation history .        in figure 1.7",
    "we show also some observational data relative to the galactic bulge , the lmc and some damped lyman-@xmath43 systems ( dla ) .",
    "as one can see , our predictions seem to reproduce the data for the galactic bulge and for lmc and also suggest that dlas could be the progenitors of the present day irregular galaxies , since most of dlas , once their abundances are corrected for the effect of dust , show low [ @xmath43/fe ] ratios at low metallicities ( vladilo , 2002 ; calura et al . 2003 ) . on the other hand , lyman - break galaxies such as cb58 ( pettini et al .",
    "2002 ) show an abundance pattern compatible with a young spheroid , either a galactic bulge or a small elliptical , suffering a galactic outflow , as recently shown by matteucci & pipino ( 2002 ) .",
