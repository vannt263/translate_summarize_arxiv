    "the statistical mechanics of loop models have been studied extensively for decades .",
    "these models describe physical systems , and also provide fundamental problems in mathematics .",
    "major progress has been made recently in understanding their properties .",
    "this is especially true when the loops are embedded in two dimensions , where the extensive variety of theoretical tools available have made many computations not only exact , but rigorous as well .    in a loop model ,",
    "the degrees of freedom are one - dimensional .",
    "these `` loops '' may branch and touch , but are not allowed to have ends .",
    "the partition function is of the form @xmath2 this sum is made precise by defining the loops to live on the links of some lattice",
    ". then @xmath3 labels a single loop configuration where the loops have total length @xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath5 links of the lattice are covered by a loop .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is therefore a weight per unit length , which in this paper will usually be tuned to a special value which makes the behavior critical .",
    "different loop models are distinguished by the choice of the weight @xmath7 .",
    "here it is required that @xmath7 depends only on _ topological _ properties of a given configuration @xmath3 .",
    "topological weights can depend on the number of loops , how many times loops touch , and more intricate properties like the number of ways of coloring a given graph .",
    "a simple and famous example of a loop model goes under a variety of names : `` ring polymers '' , `` closed self - avoiding random walks '' , or the `` @xmath8 loop model '' @xcite . here",
    "the loops are defined so that they do not branch and do not touch each other , i.e.  if two or more loops touch the same point , a prescription for resolving them must be given .",
    "a typical configuration is displayed in figure [ fig : dilute - on ] ; the lattice is rotated by 45 degrees for later convenience .",
    "a simple topologically - invariant quantity is the number of loops @xmath9 in a given loop configuration @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath8 loop model is then defined by taking @xmath10 for some parameter @xmath11 .",
    "a single loop / walk / polymer can be obtained by requiring @xmath12 .",
    "an interesting variation on this model comes from requiring that every site of the lattice be visited by at least one loop .",
    "such loops are called _ fully packed _ , and their critical points are very different from those of the @xmath8 model without this requirement @xcite .    many well - known models of statistical mechanics can be expressed in terms of loops .",
    "a simple example is the ising model in two dimensions .",
    "a loop configuration is found from each spin configuration simply by writing the domain walls separating regions of up and down spins .",
    "a given loop configuration corresponds to two spin configurations , since flipping all the spins does not change the domain walls .",
    "these ising loops / domain walls can touch , but do not have ends , and can not branch : there must be even number of links with loops at any lattice site .",
    "the weight per unit length @xmath13 for the usual ising nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath14 , while the topological weight @xmath15 for all allowed @xmath3 .",
    "it is essential to note that statistical - mechanical models defined by ( [ zloop ] ) do not necessarily have local boltzmann weights .",
    "since a single loop can be arbitrarily large , topological properties like the number of loops are defined non - locally . in some cases",
    ", there is a model with local boltzmann weights with the same partition function .",
    "generically , these boltzmann weights are complex , and so the theory is non - unitary .",
    "in some special cases like the @xmath8 model with @xmath16 with @xmath17 a positive integer , a local model with positive boltzmann weights does exist .",
    "interesting questions in both physics and mathematics arise in the continuum limit . in this limit",
    "one can apply a variety of powerful field - theory methods to understand the phase diagram and compute properties at and near critical points .",
    "one major breakthrough in the study of two - dimensional loop models came with the invention of coulomb - gas methods ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these methods allowed non - trivial critical points to be found , and many critical exponents to be computed exactly , under a well - motivated set of assumptions about the behavior of the loops in the continuum limit .",
    "further progress in understanding these critical points came with the introduction of conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "when a critical point in a loop model is in the same universality class as a known conformal field theory , then not only can critical exponents be found , but correlators computed exactly @xcite .",
    "a remarkable recent development in the study of loop models came with the introduction of schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite .",
    "sle provides a novel way of formulating conformal field theory geometrically . among many other things",
    "this gives a direct way of deriving which conformal field theory describes certain loop models ; sometimes the correspondence can even be proved rigorously .",
    "another reason for recent interest in loop models comes from the search for quantum theories with quasiparticles obeying non - abelian statistics . aside from their intrinsic interest , such quasiparticles could make up the `` qubits '' of a topological quantum computer @xcite .",
    "one of the few types of models exhibiting such quasiparticles are quantum theories whose hilbert space has basis elements consisting of loops in two dimensions .",
    "the ground - state wave function is a sum over all such loops , so that ground - state correlators in the quantum theory are identical to those in a two - dimensional classical loop model like the ones studied here .",
    "despite all the recent activity and progress , not many different types of loop models have been studied in depth .",
    "one reason is that many loop models do not have critical points .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 loop model has a critical point only when @xmath18 .",
    "there are many interesting and simple conformal field theories which have no known description in terms of loops .",
    "moreover , for all the successes of the sle approach , it applies only to a very small set of conformal field theories .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a general procedure for finding a two - dimensional loop model with a critical point and a corresponding conformal field theory description .",
    "this procedure yields a number of new models whose geometric properties should be understandable by using conformal field theory , and will hopefully prove useful for sle and for topological quantum computation .",
    "for example , the loop models described here may provide a way of geometrically interpreting the sle processes described in [ ] .",
    "the strategy is to start with classical lattice models whose degrees of freedom are not loops , but rather are _ heights _ , integer - valued variables on the sites of the square lattice .",
    "the boltzmann weights are local and positive , so any field theories obtained from taking the continuum limit of these models are unitary .",
    "the height models utilized are _ integrable _ , which makes it possible to find a variety of exact results .",
    "choosing these models judiciously makes it possible to    1 .",
    "locate critical points within the lattice model , and find the conformal field theory describing the continuum behavior of each critical point .",
    "2 .   re - express the partition function in terms of loop degrees of freedom , instead of heights , just as discussed for the ising model above .",
    "putting these two together gives a loop model whose critical point is described by a known conformal field theory .",
    "typically , this sort of precise mapping will apply only when the topological weight @xmath7 can be expressed in terms of local quantities .",
    "however , once this map is made , the extension to more general non - unitary cases is obvious .",
    "there are two types of loop models to be discussed here .",
    "_ fully packed _ loop models have the requirement that ( at least ) one loop touches every site on the lattice . models which do not have this requirement",
    "are referred to as _ dilute_. the latter naming is somewhat cavalier : the critical points of interest typically are believed to describe a phase transition between a dilute phase ( where only a set of measure zero of the sites are touched on average by a loop ) , and a dense phase ( where only a set of measure zero of the sites are not touched by a loop ) .",
    "nevertheless , since at the critical point the loop density is still zero ( like the magnetization in the ising model ) , i will persist with the name .",
    "the dilute and fully packed loop models arise here in very different ways .",
    "the fully packed models are found by expressing the transfer matrix of a lattice height model in terms of the generators of an algebra , and then finding a loop representation of the same algebra .",
    "it is then possible to define a loop model which has the identical partition function .",
    "the dilute models arise more indirectly : by studying the ground states of the hamiltonian associated with the ( same ) lattice height model , one can infer what the domain walls are .",
    "like in the ising model , the loops are the domain walls .",
    "this argument is not rigorous like that for the fully packed loops , but substantial consistency checks are made using exact results from the corner transfer matrix and the scattering matrix .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : results ] , i present the main results . in section [ on - cft ] , i review how the `` minimal models '' of conformal field theory are related to both dilute and fully packed loop models . in section",
    "[ sec : fpl ] , i introduce height models which have critical points described by the superconformal minimal models and @xmath0 conformal field theory .",
    "there these height models are used to define fully packed loop models whose topological weight is given by a chromatic polynomial . in section [ sec : dilute ] , dilute loop models are found which have these critical points , and then generalized to include @xmath1 as well . in appendix",
    "[ app : cft ] the relevant conformal field theories are reviewed briefly . in appendix",
    "[ app : bc ] , the appropriate boundary conditions for the lattice models are discussed , while some technical details on the bmw algebra are collected in appendix [ app : xe ] .",
    "in this section i introduce the dilute and fully packed loop models studied in this paper , and describe their critical points .",
    "the following sections are then devoted to explaining and deriving these results .",
    "the dilute - loop model discussed in this paper is a generalization of the @xmath8 loop model with two types of loops .",
    "the two types are strongly coupled : each link containing one kind of loop must also contain the other .",
    "a configuration is displayed in figure [ fig : dilute - k ] , where the two types of loops are represented by solid and dashed lines .",
    "the loops are drawn across the diagonals of the plaquettes of the square lattice .    in both this model and the @xmath8 model",
    "there may be two loops coming into the same point on the lattice , and it is required that they do not cross .",
    "the new model is distinguished from the @xmath8 model by how the loops are resolved when they potentially cross at the _ center _ of a plaquette . in the new models , it is required that loops of _ each type _ do not cross .",
    "loops of different types may cross ; the four different possibilities are illustrated below in figure [ fig : dilute - resolve ] .",
    "topologically - invariant quantities of such loop configurations are the numbers @xmath9 and @xmath19 of each kind of loop , and @xmath20 , the number of plaquettes with a resolved potential crossing at their center . in figure",
    "[ fig : fpl - bmw ] these are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the topological weight is @xmath24 where @xmath11 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are parameters . for @xmath27 ,",
    "this weight reduces to that of the @xmath8 model .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize @xmath11 and @xmath25 by @xmath28    i will argue that with appropriate boundary conditions , these dilute loop models have a critical point described by a unitary conformal field theory when @xmath29 and @xmath17 are integers with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these conformal field theories are called coset models , and are described briefly in appendix [ app : cft ] .",
    "the @xmath32 case reduces to the @xmath8 model , which is well known to be described by the conformal minimal models @xcite . for @xmath33 , the conformal field theories are the superconformal minimal models , whereas for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , they are the @xmath1 wess - zumino - witten models .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that this loop model has a critical point when @xmath18 and @xmath36 , although for @xmath29 and @xmath17 outside these special values , the corresponding conformal field theories will be non - unitary .",
    "a fully packed version of the @xmath8 loop model is illustrated in figure [ fig : fpl - on ] . in this version",
    "the loops cover every link of the square lattice .",
    "the only degree of freedom is how the loops are resolved at each site of the lattice : there are two possible resolutions which do not allow crossings .",
    "the topological weight is then @xmath37 when there are @xmath9 of these loops .",
    "the weight per loop is labeled @xmath38 here because for weight per unit length @xmath39 and appropriate boundary conditions , this model is equivalent to the @xmath40-state potts model at its self - dual point .",
    "this is shown using the high - temperature expansion of the potts model @xcite , which will be reviewed in section [ sec : tl - rsos ] .",
    "the potts self - dual point is critical when @xmath41 , so that the critical point occurs for a weight per loop @xmath42 , just like the dilute @xmath8 models . also like the dilute @xmath8 models , the continuum limit of the critical potts models",
    "are described by the minimal models of conformal field theory when @xmath40 takes on special values .",
    "one obtains the @xmath29th minimal model when @xmath43 with @xmath29 integer ; note the shift of @xmath29 relative to the dilute value found in ( [ nm ] ) with @xmath32 .",
    "this critical point is often called the _ dense _ critical point of the @xmath8 loop model @xcite .    in terms of the more general coset conformal field theories with central charge ( [ ccoset ] ) , the minimal models and hence the dense critical points have @xmath32 . in section [ sec : fpl ] i derive fully packed loop models which have critical points corresponding to the @xmath33 case , the superconformal minimal models .",
    "a typical configuration in this fully packed model is illustrated in figure [ fig : fpl - bmw ] .",
    "there are three allowed configurations for each vertex , the two ways of resolving the lines so that they do not cross , and a third , which i call the `` intersection '' .",
    "since these intersections are not resolved , the configurations do not really form loops , but for lack of a better name , i still call the degrees of freedom loops .",
    "the topological weight of the model is not defined by resolving the intersections to make the configurations into non - crossing loops . instead , it is given in terms of the _",
    "chromatic polynomial_. to define the chromatic polynomial , it is first useful to note that the loops divide the plane into different regions .",
    "these regions can be thought of as countries on a map , and a @xmath44-coloring gives each country one of @xmath44 colors , such that adjacent countries must have different colors . if two regions touch only at a point ( or any countable set of points ) , they are not adjacent .",
    "this is convenient to formulate in terms of the dual graph .",
    "each region corresponds to a vertex on the dual graph , and two vertices are joined by an edge if the corresponding regions are adjacent .",
    "the dual graph for the loop configuration in figure [ fig : fpl - bmw ] is illustrated in [ fig : dualgraph ] .",
    "note that the dual graph only depends on the topology of the original loop configuration .",
    "the number of @xmath44-colorings @xmath45 of the dual graph is the number of ways of assigning @xmath44 colors to each vertex with the constraint that any vertices joined by an edge must be a different color .",
    "there exists no closed - form formula for the number of colorings of a general graph .",
    "however , @xmath46 can be determined recursively .",
    "consider two vertices connected by an edge @xmath47 ( i.e.  two regions sharing a boundary in the original picture ) . then define @xmath48 to be the graph with the @xmath47 edge deleted , and @xmath49 to be the graph with the two vertices connected by @xmath47 joined into one .",
    "then it is simple to prove that @xmath50 in the dual graph of @xmath3 the two vertices connected by @xmath47 must be colored differently , while in @xmath48 , they may be the same , thus @xmath51 , and the number of colorings overcounted is @xmath52 .",
    "the number of colorings can then be determined by using this recursion relation to remove edges and vertices from @xmath3 until it is a sum of terms which have no edges at all .",
    "a term with @xmath53 vertices and no edges has @xmath54 .",
    "an illuminating example is the case where there are no intersections , so that the configurations really are loops .",
    "the dual graph is then tree - like ( it has no faces ) .",
    "vertices at the ends of the tree can be removed one by one using ( [ recursion ] ) , with each vertex being removed giving a factor @xmath55 .",
    "this yields @xmath56 for a tree with @xmath57 vertices . using the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] )",
    "gives for the loop configuration in figure [ fig : fpl - bmw ] and the dual graph in figure [ fig : dualgraph ] @xmath58    repeatedly applying the recursion relation gives @xmath59 as a polynomial in @xmath44 of order @xmath57 .",
    "this is known as the chromatic polynomial , and depends only on the dual graph of @xmath60 .",
    "this polynomial provides a well - defined extension of @xmath46 away from @xmath44 integer .",
    "the fully packed loop model is therefore uniquely defined for any @xmath44 with topological weight @xmath61 @xmath62 is the number of intersections ; the factor involving it arises from the detailed analysis below .",
    "the full partition function is given by using this topological weight with ( [ zloops ] ) , where the weight per unit length of loop is @xmath39 .",
    "the sum is over all loops on the square lattice such that each plaquette has one of the three configurations drawn in figure [ fig : ixe ] .    in section [ fplk2 ]",
    "i prove that the loop model with topological weight ( [ wchrome ] ) has a critical point described by the @xmath29th superconformal minimal model ( i.e.  those in ( [ coset ] ) with @xmath33 ) , when @xmath63 these fully packed models presumably remain critical for all real @xmath29 , but are described by a non - unitary conformal field theory for @xmath29 non - integer .",
    "this loop model is very similar to that of @xcite , which arises from the low - temperature expansion of the @xmath44-state potts model .",
    "the topological weight is given by the chromatic polynomial .",
    "the loops there are dilute , not fully packed , and intersections with three lines coming out are allowed there . as a result ,",
    "the critical point there is described by the conformal minimal models instead of the superconformal minimal models .",
    "this is not the only fully packed loop model which has critical points corresponding to the superconformal minimal models .",
    "one based on non - intersecting loops on the `` copper - oxide '' lattice will also be briefly discussed below .",
    "the strategy of this paper is to use known integrable lattice models to find loop models with critical points described by conformal field theories . in this section",
    "this strategy is used to connect the @xmath8 loop models with the minimal models of conformal field theory .",
    "none of the results in this section are new , but possibly some of the arguments are . after introducing the lattice models ,",
    "the two different possible loop expansions are derived .",
    "even though both loop expansions come from the same lattice model , they arise in very different ways .",
    "the fully packed loops arise by rewriting the model in terms of an algebraic formulation of the transfer matrix , which in most contexts is a high - temperature expansion .",
    "dilute loops arise from a domain - wall expansion , which is a low - temperature expansion .",
    "the lattice models here are the `` restricted - solid - on - solid '' ( rsos ) models introduced by andrews , baxter and forrester @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom are integer - valued heights @xmath64 on each site @xmath65 of the square lattice .",
    "there are two types of restriction .",
    "the first is that @xmath64 only takes a finite number of possibilities , which are numbered from @xmath66 for some integer @xmath29 .",
    "the second is that heights on adjacent sites must differ only by 1 , i.e. @xmath67 for @xmath65 and @xmath68 nearest neighbors .",
    "the latter restriction will be modified for the models in later sections . in order to utilize crucial exact results ,",
    "i study only height and loop models on the square lattice .",
    "however , frequently ( but not always ) , one obtains similar results on different two - dimensional lattices .",
    "the @xmath69 case is the ising model : on one sublattice the height must always be @xmath70 , so that on the other sublattice the heights @xmath71 and @xmath72 play the roles of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 ising spins .",
    "the @xmath75 rsos model is known as the hard square model @xcite ; a typical configuration is illustrated in figure [ fig : hardsq ] below .",
    "the rsos models are interesting and useful because for special choices of the boltzmann weights , they are integrable .",
    "integrability allows a number of important physical quantities to be computed exactly , under a set of standard analyticity assumptions .",
    "critical points and the associated exponents can be found using a powerful technique called the corner transfer matrix @xcite .",
    "conformal field theory also provides a list of critical exponents associated with critical points . by comparing the two lists",
    ", one can usually identify the conformal field theory describing the continuum limit of any critical point in an rsos model .",
    "for these rsos models , there are two known critical points for each value of @xmath76 .",
    "this paper is concerned with just one of them , the one separating regimes iii and iv in the nomenclature of [ ] . this critical point is described by the @xmath29th minimal model , with central charge given by ( [ cmin ] ) @xcite .    finding the loop models associated with this rsos model and hence the conformal minimal models requires analyzing the boltzmann weights in detail .",
    "the weights contains nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions , so the total weight can be written as a product of weights assigned to the four heights around each square plaquette .",
    "such a model is called `` interaction round a face '' @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath77 is defined to act across the diagonals of the lattice , as illustrated in figure [ fig : diag ] .",
    "it therefore acts on a zig - zag row of heights @xmath64 , @xmath78 , taking it to the next row , labeled by @xmath79 .",
    "it can be broken into pieces @xmath80 , which depend only on the heights around a square , and can change @xmath64 to @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath77 can be written in the form @xmath82 where the identity matrix @xmath83 .",
    "for the rsos critical point of interest here , we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a parameter , and the elements of the matrix @xmath86 for @xmath65 even are @xcite @xmath87_q      [ h'_i]_q}}{[h_{i+1}]_q } \\prod_{j\\hbox { even , } j\\ne i } i_j \\label{ersos}\\ ] ] where @xmath88_q\\equiv ( q^h - q^{-h})/(q - q^{-1}),\\qquad   q\\equiv e^{\\pi i/(p+1)}.\\ ] ] acting with @xmath86 therefore allows the height on the @xmath65th site to change when @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath65 odd , the matrix @xmath86 is essentially the same : @xmath90_q      [ h'_i]_q}}{[h'_{i+1}]_q } \\prod_{j\\hbox { odd , } j\\ne i } i_j \\label{ersosii}\\ ] ]    the rsos transfer matrix written in this form exhibits an interesting and important algebraic structure : the @xmath86 generate the _ temperley - lieb algebra _ @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to check that they satisfy @xmath91 this algebra first arose in studies of the @xmath44-state potts model , whose transfer matrix also can be written in the form ( [ tprod],[te ] ) , with the @xmath86 satisfying the same algebra ( [ tlalg ] ) with @xmath92 . since then",
    ", it has been shown how to write many other lattice models in this same form .",
    "writing a transfer matrix in terms of the temperley - lieb generators is exceptionally useful because many properties of the model follow solely from the algebra , and are independent of the representation of the @xmath86 . with appropriately - chosen boundary conditions ,",
    "the partition function is independent of representation .",
    "this is shown for a two - dimensional surface with the topology of a sphere in the appendix [ app : bc ] , while detailed discussions for the cylinder and torus can be found in [ ] . in many considerations , understanding the boundary conditions",
    "precisely is very important ; for example , the central charge of the continuum conformal field theory depends on them . for the results here , the details of the boundary conditions",
    "are not particularly important  what is of main importance is that appropriate ones exist .",
    "this construction of the fully packed loop model associated with each critical rsos model is virtually identical to that of the fully packed loop model for the potts model @xcite .",
    "this is easiest to do by using a graphical representation of the temperley - lieb generators @xcite .",
    "fully packed loop configurations are not in one - to - one correspondence with those of the height or potts model .",
    "rather , for each height configuration , the product in ( [ tprod ] ) is expanded out by using ( [ te ] ) .",
    "one obtains either the identity @xmath93 or the temperley - lieb generator @xmath94 for each plaquette , so that for @xmath95 plaquettes there are @xmath96 terms .",
    "each term can be graphically represented by drawing one of the two pictures in figure [ fig : tl ] for each plaquette , depending on whether @xmath93 or @xmath94 appeared for this plaquette .",
    "this gives a fully packed configuration of self - avoiding and mutually - avoiding loops on the dual square lattice .",
    "every link of the dual lattice is covered by a loop , and at each vertex there are two possible ways of resolving the lines so that the loops do not cross .",
    "these properties can be preserved at the boundaries as well , as described in appendix [ app : bc ] .    to obtain the fully packed loop model",
    ", one must sum over the heights in the rsos representation ( or the spins in the potts representation ) , leaving only the loops themselves as the degrees of freedom .",
    "the sum is not difficult to do directly in the rsos representation @xcite ( or in the potts representation @xcite ) , by using the explicit representation for @xmath94 , as given in ( [ ersos ] ) .",
    "it is more instructive , however , to not utilize the details of any explicit representation , but rather to exploit the properties of the temperley - lieb algebra . in the transfer matrix ,",
    "summing over heights amounts to multiplying the matrices defined by @xmath97 and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the algebra itself can be represented graphically as in figure [ fig : tlalg ] . from this",
    "it is apparent that small closed loops receive a weight @xmath98 . by using both relations ,",
    "it is easy to check that _ all _ loops receive this same weight @xmath98 , no matter what their size ( for details , see appendix [ app : bc ] ) . setting @xmath99 to make the model isotropic ( invariant under 90-degree rotations ) yields the fully packed @xmath8 loop model discussed in the introduction .",
    "the weight per loop is @xmath100 $ ] for the rsos model , or @xmath101 for the @xmath44-state potts model .",
    "the weight per unit length of loop @xmath6 in this case is unimportant , because every link is covered by a loop .",
    "the @xmath8 loop model can of course be defined for any @xmath11 , but is only critical for @xmath102 .",
    "this is shown by using the representation of yet another lattice model , the six - vertex model , in terms of the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite .",
    "another interesting thing to note is that even when @xmath102 , the conformal field theory is unitary only for integer @xmath103 . the representation ( [ ersos ] ) exists for any value of @xmath104 , but the only ones leading to real and positive boltzmann weights for @xmath105 occur at @xmath29 integer .",
    "the dilute @xmath8 loop model also has a critical point related to the conformal minimal models @xcite .",
    "a way of showing this heuristically is to compare the coulomb - gas description of the minimal models @xcite to that arising from the lattice model @xcite .",
    "a way of showing this directly is to study a different series of integrable rsos models known as the `` dilute temperley - lieb '' models @xcite . in this section",
    "i give another method of relating the two , by using the rsos models defined in section [ sec : tl - rsos ] .",
    "this is the method which readily generalizes to @xmath31 .",
    "it is useful to start by discussing how the dilute temperley - lieb models are related to the @xmath8 loop model @xcite .",
    "the dilute models are defined in terms of integer heights on the square lattice like the rsos models discussed above in section [ sec : tl - rsos ] , but the restriction on neighboring heights in the dilute models is relaxed to @xmath106 .",
    "the loops are simply the domain walls between different heights .",
    "the `` dilute '' in the name refers to the fact that because @xmath107 can vanish for nearest neighbors , there need not be domain walls on every link . just drawing domain walls does not immediately make it into the @xmath8 loop model : there is no reason _ a priori _ why a region of heights @xmath71 and @xmath70 has the same weight as a region of heights @xmath70 and @xmath72 .",

    "the two phases coexist  the hard - square model has three symmetry - equivalent ground states . when the couplings are tuned to the values in ( [ wvu ] ) , this first - order line terminates in the tricritical point @xcite .",
    "this information about the ground states is sufficient to guess what the lowest - energy excitations are ; in the next subsection [ tl - ctm ] i will justify these guesses using the corner transfer matrix .",
    "excited states along this first - order transition line are defects , where two different ground states meet . for example",
    ", the state @xmath157 has two defects , and energy order @xmath158 higher than the ground state .",
    "thus each of these defects has energy of order @xmath159 .",
    "such a defect occurs at site @xmath65 any time @xmath160 .",
    "there are two kinds of fundamental defects , with the same energy . denoting the three ground states as @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , where @xmath164 , one kind of fundamental defect separates @xmath161 and @xmath162 , while the other separates @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the former defect is located at the site where there is a height @xmath70 between the heights @xmath71 and @xmath72 , while the latter is located at the site where there is a height @xmath72 between heights @xmath70 and @xmath136 .",
    "a defect @xmath165 separating @xmath161 from @xmath163 has twice the energy as the fundamental defects , and is comprised of two fundamental defects .",
    "these statements can be translated from the one - dimensional quantum hamiltonian back to the two - dimensional hard - square model @xcite .",
    "the three ground states of the hamiltonian result in three different ways the _ free energy _",
    "density can be minimized .",
    "one can easily check that at the critical point , the weight of the configuration with all heights @xmath71 and @xmath70 ( which in a slight abuse of notation can be labeled @xmath161 ) is larger than that of the configuration containing all heights @xmath70 and @xmath72 ( the 2d analog of @xmath162 ) . on the first - order line , there are three different ways the free - energy density can be minimized .",
    "the reason is that there are more configurations `` close '' to @xmath162 than there are to @xmath161 or @xmath163 , so the increased entropy will compensate for the increased energy .",
    "this is the cause as well of the shift of the first - order line in ( [ firstorder ] ) . with @xmath162 ,",
    "one can change any height @xmath70 to height @xmath136 , and any height @xmath72 to height @xmath71 , without violating the hard - square rule . with @xmath161 ,",
    "one can change any height @xmath71 to height @xmath72 , but it is not possible to change any heights @xmath70 to height @xmath136 without violating the restriction , unless one also changes the four heights @xmath71 around it . in the language of hard squares , there are more ways of adding a square to the empty configuration than there are of removing one from the full configuration , since in the latter the squares occupy only every other site .",
    "thus the three ground states turn into the three minima of the free energy .",
    "the partition function can therefore be rewritten as a sum over domain - wall configurations separating the free - energy minima .",
    "the excited states of the hamiltonian become the domain walls in the 2d classical model , separating regions of @xmath148 broken and unbroken symmetry .",
    "these domain walls are the world - lines of the one - dimensional defects , and their contribution to the free energy depends only on their length times some positive constant @xmath166 . by the symmetry",
    "@xmath137 , @xmath166 must be the same for both kinds of domain wall .",
    "a non - vanishing @xmath166 is the reason the transition is first - order : the tricritical point occurs when the couplings are tuned to make @xmath167 . in this limit",
    "there is no free - energy penalty for creating a domain wall , and they proliferate .",
    "it is finally possible to give the argument as to why the hard - square model is equivalent to a loop model , in the sense that they are described by the same field theories in the continuum limit .",
    "i have argued that the hard - square model along its first - order line can be thought effectively as having three free - energy minima .",
    "domain walls separating regions of these minima have a free - energy weight per unit length .",
    "the domain walls form loops which do not touch : as noted above , domain walls separating @xmath161 and @xmath162 are located along sites with height @xmath70 , while domain walls separating regions @xmath162 and @xmath163 are located along sites with height @xmath72 .",
    "these domain walls are illustrated in figure [ fig : hardsq ] .",
    "i emphasize that this picture involving free energies and domain walls is effective : these should be thought of as renormalized quantities .",
    "nevertheless , these results imply that along the first - order line , the partition function of the hard - square model can be written in the form @xmath168 @xmath3 is a configuration of loops of total length @xmath5 on the links of the dual square lattice , with the condition that they can not touch . in this expansion , no distinction is made between the two different types of domain walls : the fact there are two types of loops can be taken into account in the weight @xmath7 . to do this ,",
    "draw a loop configuration .",
    "the restrictions on heights mean that a loop separates a region of @xmath162 from a region of either @xmath161 or @xmath163 .",
    "since the energies of @xmath163 and @xmath161 are related by the @xmath148 symmetry , we can then sum over these two possibilities .",
    "half the regions inside the loops therefore must be @xmath162 , while the other half can be either @xmath161 or @xmath163 .",
    "this results in a weight @xmath169 , where @xmath9 is the total number of loops , so that the weight per loop is @xmath170 .",
    "this is the dilute @xmath8 loop model with @xmath171 . the ( tri)critical point occurs at @xmath172 where there is no penalty for longer loops and they can proliferate .",
    "the loop model therefore arises here indirectly , as opposed to the dilute temperley - lieb models , where the domain walls and hence the loops are manifest in the original lattice height configurations @xcite .",
    "all arguments give the same result : the conformal field theory with @xmath75 describes the critical point of the @xmath173 dilute loop model on the sphere .      in the preceding subsection [ tl - dilute ]",
    "i detailed an argument relating the rsos model with @xmath75 to the @xmath173 loop model .",
    "the argument can be strengthened and generalized to arbitrary @xmath29 by using the corner transfer matrix technique @xcite .",
    "the corner transfer matrix allows one to find the ground states in general , and also gives essential information about the defect energies .",
    "consider a two - dimensional lattice model on a square lattice , as illustrated in figure [ fig : ctm ] .",
    "the corner transfer matrix acts on @xmath174 sites along a line , taking them to @xmath174 sites along a line _ perpendicular _ to the original line .",
    "the partition function for the full model is then built up from four corner transfer matrices .",
    "the glory of the corner transfer matrix is that , as opposed to the usual transfer matrix , its eigenvalues can be determined exactly and explicitly if the model is integrable @xcite .",
    "its eigenvalues have special analyticity properties in one of the couplings ( @xmath85 here ) , which allows one to show that they must be independent of other couplings . in the hard - square model ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the corner transfer matrix are the same along the entire first - order line .",
    "therefore , they can be computed by going to the far `` end '' of this line , where in the hamiltonian @xmath175 . in this limit , not only are the three states @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 the exact ground states of the hamiltonian , but every height configuration is an eigenstate .",
    "this limit is `` frozen '' , because in the two - dimensional lattice model all the heights along a diagonal are frozen to be the same .",
    "for example , in the northeast and southwest quadrants of figure [ fig : ctm ] , the heights along each diagonal in the northwest / southeast direction must be the same .",
    "moving away from the frozen limit , the eigenstates of the corner transfer matrix will change , but the eigenvalues , and hence the type of ground states , stay the same all along the first - order line .",
    "the same picture holds for all @xmath29 : there is a first - order transition line going from a multicritical point to a frozen point .    from the corner transfer matrix eigenvalues",
    "one can compute the local height probabilities @xmath176 , defined as the probability that the height in the center will be height @xmath177 , given that the heights around the edges of the square are @xmath26 and @xmath178 , as illustrated in figure [ fig : ctm ] .",
    "the @xmath174 heights along a line starting at the center are labeled @xmath64 , so that @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "then @xcite @xmath182 @xmath183 where @xmath184 is a ( known ) factor independent of the heights other than @xmath179 , and @xmath185 parametrizes the first - order line , so that @xmath186 is the frozen limit and @xmath187 is the multicritical point .",
    "the sum is over all allowed height configurations , and the contribution of each distinct configuration to this probability is obvious .",
    "the @xmath68 in the expression for @xmath188 arises because there are @xmath68 sites along the @xmath68th diagonal , and in the frozen limit each site contributes equally to the eigenvalue .",
    "the results found in the previous subsection [ tl - dilute ] using the hamiltonian are therefore identical to those implied by the corner transfer matrix , and generalize to all @xmath29 .",
    "ground states in the frozen limit have @xmath189 in ( [ eh ] ) .",
    "these are states where the heights on every other site are the same , and it is natural to expect that the ground states all along the first - order line will be dominated by these configurations . because of the restriction that @xmath190 , all states of the form @xmath191 . for the @xmath29th model ,",
    "this means there are @xmath192 ground states .",
    "a defect at site @xmath193 occurs when @xmath194 ; such a defect runs all along the diagonal , and so has an energy of @xmath70 per unit length in the units implied by ( [ pq],[eh ] ) .",
    "all defects have this energy per unit length , no matter which ground states they separate .",
    "the translation of these results to the two - dimensional lattice model is essentially the same as for @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "each of the @xmath192 ground states @xmath195 corresponds to a degenerate minimum of the free energy .",
    "thus for @xmath186 the partition function is dominated by regions of these minima , separated by domain walls which all have the same energy per unit length . for general @xmath29 ,",
    "as opposed to @xmath196 , there is no symmetry forcing the domain walls to have the same energy , but rather it is a consequence of the fine tunings necessary to make the model integrable and on the first - order transition line . as @xmath187 , the multicritical point of interest",
    "is approached , and the energy per unit length of the domain walls goes to zero .    the restrictions on adjacent heights and on domain walls can be simply encoded in terms of _ adjacency diagrams_. for heights , the diagram has a node for every allowed height , and two nodes are connected by a edge if the corresponding heights are allowed to be on adjacent sites . for ground states ,",
    "the diagram has a node for every ground state , and two nodes are connected if a fundamental domain wall can separate the two ground states .",
    "the rsos models discussed above have @xmath192 different ground states @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath197 .",
    "the fundamental domain walls separate successive ground states on this list : i.e.  a region of @xmath198 can only be adjacent to @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "thus in this case the adjacency diagrams for the heights and for the ground states look the same , except there are @xmath29 nodes in the height diagram , and @xmath192 nodes in the ground - state diagram . for both types",
    ", the @xmath68th node is connected to the @xmath193 and @xmath201 nodes .",
    "the nodes of the ground - state diagram correspond to the edges of the height diagram ; this remains true for the more general rsos models discussed in the next section .",
    "the two diagrams for @xmath202 are displayed in figure [ fig : adjacency ] .    by the same argument as for @xmath75 ,",
    "these results make it likely that the @xmath29th minimal conformal field theory describes the continuum limit of the critical point of a loop model with partition function of the form ( [ zloop],[zloops ] ) : @xmath203 with suitable boundary conditions . to obtain the topological weight @xmath7",
    ", one must sum over the all the height configurations consistent with a fixed loop configuration .",
    "the simplest way to do this sum is to define the _ adjacency matrix _",
    "@xmath204 for the ground states .",
    "this is the adjacency diagram in matrix form : each row and column of this matrix corresponds to a ground state , with the @xmath205 if the ground states labeled by @xmath177 and @xmath26 can be separated by a fundamental domain wall , and zero otherwise . for the rsos models here , it is @xmath206 for @xmath207 .",
    "for example , for @xmath202 it is @xmath208 the topological weight @xmath7 is the number of height configurations possible for each loop configuration @xmath3 .",
    "this is easily written in terms of @xmath204 .",
    "index each loop by @xmath68 , such that it separates regions of ground states labeled by @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "then the number of allowed height configurations is @xmath211 where the sum is over all ground states in each region . thus adding another loop amounts to multiplying by @xmath204 . for a large number of non - intersecting loops @xmath9 , one therefore obtains @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath204 . for the adjacency matrix ( [ arsos ] ) , this is @xmath214 thus the rsos models in this section indeed correspond in the continuum limit to the @xmath8 loop model with @xmath108 .",
    "this agrees with the two earlier cases we derived : @xmath215 for the ising model , and @xmath171 for the hard - square model .",
    "a very nice corroboration of this picture comes from studying the scattering matrix of the 1 + 1 dimensional theory in the continuum limit of the first - order line @xcite . in field - theory language",
    ", moving along the first - order line away from the multi - critical point corresponds to a perturbation by the relevant @xmath216 `` energy '' operator .",
    "this field theory is integrable like the underlying lattice model , so one find the quasiparticles and their exact scattering matrix .",
    "these quasiparticles turn out to be kinks which are defects between @xmath192 ground states , exactly as we have seen .",
    "this identification of the worldlines of these kinks as the loops in the @xmath8 model with @xmath108 was made long ago @xcite .",
    "in fact , the correspondence is even closer : the scattering matrix itself can be expressed in terms of the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite .",
    "namely , there is a representation of @xmath93 and @xmath94 acting on the kinks , such that the two - particle scattering matrix for two particles of momentum @xmath217 and @xmath218 is @xmath219 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 are known functions .",
    "this correspondence between the loops and the world - lines of the kinks in the 1 + 1-dimensional description was exploited in [ ] to discuss different loop models for the @xmath44-state potts models .",
    "in section [ on - cft ] i gave a dilute and fully packed loop model associated with each rsos height model of andrews , baxter and forrester .",
    "the conformal minimal models describe the critical points . in this and the next section",
    "the methods developed in the last section are used to find new loop models from more complicated rsos height models .",

    "this has important consequences for both the dilute and fully packed loop models .",
    "the lattice model with weights ( [ txe ] ) is integrable when the @xmath256 and @xmath257 satisfy an algebra known as the @xmath259 birman - murakami - wenzl ( bmw ) algebra @xcite .",
    "this algebra is best thought of as the spin-1 generalization of the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "in fact , any representation of the temperley - lieb algebra yields one of the @xmath259 bmw algebra @xcite ; expressions for @xmath256 and @xmath257 in terms of the @xmath86 are given in appendix [ app : xe ] .",
    "the algebraic relations of the @xmath256 and @xmath257 can be found in [ ] , and are given in appendix [ app : xe ] .    as with lattice models based on the temperley - lieb algebra , many of the properties of the models with boltzmann weights ( [ txe ] ) are independent of the representation of the @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "the most illuminating representation of these generators is a graphical one . to find this , it is useful to study first another representation of the same algebra @xcite .",
    "this representation arises in the @xmath44-state potts model with infinitely - strong antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interactions , and ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "a `` spin '' @xmath260 , taking the integer values @xmath261 , is placed at each site @xmath65 of the square lattice .",
    "the restriction on nearest - neighbor spins is simpler than that of the height models : adjacent spins must be different . if all configurations were weighted equally , this would be the antiferromagnetic @xmath44-state potts model at zero temperature .",
    "however , at the critical point of interest , there are ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions . labeling the spins around a plaquette as @xmath262 , @xmath260 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 , in the same fashion as the heights in figure [ fig : diag ] , the restriction on nearest neighbors means that @xmath265 for each plaquette . the transfer matrix is then given by ( [ txe ] ) , with @xmath266 it is easy to check that these satisfy the @xmath259 bmw algebra with @xmath267 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath268 there is a critical point described by a conformal field theory with @xmath269 for @xmath270 and @xmath271 for @xmath272 . using ( [ xepotts ] ) in the hamiltonian ( [ hxe ] ) makes it clear that the next - nearest - neighbor interaction wants to make spins the same , so this critical point presumably separates an ordered phase from a disordered one .",
    "a graphical representation of @xmath93 , @xmath188 and @xmath273 in ( [ xepotts ] ) is presented in figure [ fig : ixe ] .",
    "the lines represent domain walls between different spins ; any spins not separated by a domain wall must be the same .",
    "the @xmath273 generator has regions touching only at a point ; these may ( but need not ) have the same spin .",
    "a fully packed loop model is obtained in the same fashion as the temperley - lieb case .",
    "the partition function is expanded out in powers of @xmath85 and @xmath251 .",
    "each term corresponds to a loop configuration after the heights are summed over .",
    "the generators @xmath93 and @xmath188 are 90-degree rotations of each other , so a rotationally - invariant model is obtained by taking @xmath254 and @xmath274 in ( [ txe ] ) .",
    "this yields a loop model with a typical configuration illustrated in figure [ fig : fpl - bmw ] .",
    "the loops here have a very important difference with the self- and mutually - avoiding loops of the @xmath8 loop model : because of the @xmath273 vertex , the loops can touch .",
    "( thus properly speaking , they should nt even be called loops , but rather graphs with quadrivalent vertices . )    since the @xmath33 rsos height models are based on a different representation of the same @xmath259 bmw algebra , these have the same partition function as the loop models when @xmath275 for @xmath29 integer .",
    "therefore the loop models at these values of @xmath29 also have critical points with the same conformal field theory description , the superconformal minimal models .",
    "the graphical representation is valid for all @xmath44 , not just the @xmath44 integer where ( [ xepotts ] ) applies , or for @xmath276 with @xmath29 integer for the height models .",
    "it is likely that these loop models have a critical point for all @xmath268 , although its field - theory description will only be unitary for @xmath29 integer .",
    "the topological weight can be worked out using the bmw algebra .",
    "however , it is much simpler to find it by using the representation ( [ xepotts ] ) valid for integer @xmath44 .",
    "the lines in the graphical representation correspond to domain walls for the spins @xmath260 .",
    "this constrains spins in regions separated by domain walls to be different ( if two regions meet only at a point , the corresponding spins are still permitted to be the same ) .",
    "each allowed spin configuration then receives the same weight , so the topological weight per loop configuration is given by the number of different spin configurations .",
    "this is simply the number of ways of coloring the regions with @xmath44 colors , subject to the constraint that adjacent regions have different colors .",
    "this is simply @xmath46 , as defined in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "this argument holds true for any positive integer @xmath44 .",
    "this can be generalized uniquely to arbitrary @xmath44 by recognizing that @xmath46 for a given dual graph satisfies the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) , and thus is a polynomial in @xmath44 .",
    "thus the sum over heights for any @xmath44 yields @xmath46 . to get the full topological weight , note that every time an @xmath256 appears in the expansion of the partition function , it comes with a weight @xmath253 , as detailed after equation ( [ txe ] ) .",
    "the number of @xmath273 vertices @xmath62 is a topological invariant .",
    "the topological weight is therefore that given in ( [ wchrome ] ) , namely @xmath277    this completes the mapping of the @xmath33 rsos height models onto the loop model described in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "however , this fully packed loop model is not the only one in this universality class .",
    "as described in appendix [ app : xe ] , the @xmath259 bmw algebra can be written in terms of the temperley - lieb generators . in this representation",
    ", there are two lines on every link , with a projection operator @xmath278 ensure that the two are in the spin-1 representation of @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , the graphical representation in figure [ fig : tl ] can be used with ( [ extl ] ) to give a fully packed loop model on the @xmath279 lattice .",
    "the @xmath279 lattice is formed by taking a square lattice ( the coppers ) , and adding an extra site on each link ( the oxygens ) . at every copper site ,",
    "one gets @xmath93 , @xmath273 , or @xmath188 as above .",
    "however , instead of using the above graphical representation with an intersection for @xmath273 , one writes them instead in terms of @xmath93 and @xmath94 using ( [ extl ] ) , and uses figure [ fig : tl ] to represent them graphically ( illustrations can be found in [ ] ) .",
    "the projectors on the links ( the oxygen sites ) are expanded in terms of @xmath93 and @xmath94 as well , by using @xmath280 .",
    "this means that on the oxygen sites as well .",
    "this yields a somewhat strange but well - defined fully packed loop model on the @xmath279 lattice , which has a critical point described by the superconformal minimal models .",
    "this construction can readily be generalized to larger @xmath17 integer as well .",
    "in this section i give a dilute - loop description of the @xmath33 height models and superconformal minimal models .",
    "the methods are similar to those used in sections [ tl - dilute ] and [ tl - ctm ] for the @xmath32 height models and the conformal minimal models .",
    "as opposed to the precise results for the fully packed loop models , the mapping for dilute loops is indirect , and thus is just a conjecture , not a proof .",
    "the corner transfer matrix results for the fused rsos models have long been known @xcite . the results of interest are along an integrable line of couplings , known as `` regime iii '' in the literature . like for the hard - square and @xmath32 rsos models , along this line ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hxe ] ) has degenerate ground states .",
    "this is apparent from the computation of the local height probabilities from the corner transfer matrix .",
    "the formula is identical to the earlier case ; the only distinction is that the restrictions on the heights are different .",
    "namely , the local height probability is still given by ( [ pq ] ) , where @xmath185 parametrizes the integrable line of couplings , with @xmath186 the frozen limit and @xmath187 is the multicritical point .",
    "for @xmath33 , the heights are even integers @xmath281 , and @xmath64 and @xmath248 on adjacent sites obey @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "it is convenient to distinguish between heights on the two sublattices of the square lattice , each sublattice comprised of every other site . denoting heights on one sublattice without a bar , and one with a bar ,",
    "the adjacency diagrams for the @xmath33 height models with @xmath284 and @xmath285 are given in figure [ fig : adjbmw ] .",
    "unbarred heights are always adjacent to barred heights , and vice versa .    the energy @xmath188 in ( [ eh ] ) is minimized when the heights on every other site are the same .",
    "this is an exact ground state of the model in the frozen limit . as argued in section [ tl - ctm",
    "] , each configuration with this property should correspond to a ground state of the hamiltonian all along the integrable line , including at the multicritical point , where @xmath286 is given in ( [ hxe ] ) .",
    "these ground states are therefore of the form @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "as before , each ground state corresponds to a edge on the height adjacency diagram .",
    "excited states are defects between ground states . for the @xmath32 case",
    ", a defect at site @xmath65 means @xmath289 . here , a defect can have @xmath290 or @xmath291 . however , for the latter defect , @xmath188 in ( [ eh ] ) is twice as large .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that @xmath291 defects can be treated as two of the @xmath292 defects .",
    "( thus one can have a `` double defect '' on one plaquette . )",
    "thus fundamental defects are only those where @xmath293 , so the adjacency diagram for ground states looks like those illustrated in figure [ fig : adjgsbmw ] .",
    "another way of making the distinction between fundamental and composite defects is that a fundamental defect occurs between @xmath294 and @xmath295 if either @xmath296 or @xmath297 .",
    "the ground states and fundamental defects are easiest to list in terms of new labels .",
    "relabel ground states of the form @xmath298 as @xmath299 , those of the form @xmath300 as @xmath301 , and those of the form @xmath302 as @xmath303 .",
    "the different ground states @xmath304 then have @xmath305 , and @xmath306 with @xmath307 odd .",
    "the fundamental defects then separate the ground states @xmath308 and @xmath309 if @xmath310 _ and _ @xmath311 . note that with this relabeling , the constraints on @xmath312 and @xmath225 are independent of each other",
    "moreover , the constraints on @xmath312 and @xmath225 individually are exactly the same as for the ground states of the @xmath32 height models .",
    "this means that the ground - state adjacency matrix for the @xmath33 models can be written as the tensor product @xmath313 where we denote the adjacency matrices for general @xmath17 and @xmath29 by @xmath314 .",
    "the adjacency matrix for the heights does _ not _ obey such a simple decomposition : this is only a property of the ground states and fundamental defects .",
    "as with the @xmath32 case , the world lines of the fundamental defects are interpreted in the two - dimensional lattice model as domain walls between free - energy minima .",
    "these domain walls form the loops .",
    "domain walls in these rsos models occur when heights _ across _ a square plaquette are different .",
    "these domain walls are drawn on the _ diagonals _ of the original lattice , as seen in the ( non - intersecting ) loops of figure [ fig : hardsq ] .",
    "( in the fully packed loop models , the links are drawn on the links of the dual lattice . )",
    "each link of the original lattice corresponds to a ground state , so the domain walls separate links with different ground states .    to complete the argument , the topological weight @xmath7 of each loop configuration must be found .",
    "the simplest possibility , realized for @xmath32 , is that is that these domain walls never cross , so that the loops self - avoid and mutually avoid .",
    "summing over the heights in the model then gives the topological weight of the @xmath8 loop model : @xmath315 , where @xmath9 is the number of loops . for several reasons ,",
    "such a @xmath316 can not be correct for @xmath31 .",
    "first of all , domain walls do cross for @xmath31 .",
    "this happens when all four ground states around a link are different . in the @xmath33 model ,",
    "the domain walls cross when the heights around a plaquette are of the forms @xmath317 the four different ground states on these two plaquettes are @xmath318 , @xmath319 , @xmath320 and @xmath300 .",
    "these have a non - zero boltzmann weight coming from @xmath256 , as given in appendix [ app : xe ] .",
    "configurations like these can not occur in the @xmath32 model , where @xmath97 requires that the top and bottom heights be the same , while @xmath86 requires that the left and right be the same .    even if one were to assume that such crossings are irrelevant , the value of @xmath11 obtained is still inconsistent .",
    "namely , if crossings are ignored , one obtains the dilute @xmath8 loop models as with @xmath32 .",
    "the arguments of section [ tl - ctm ] give the weight @xmath11 per loop to be the largest eigenvalue of @xmath204 .",
    "this is easy to find from ( [ a2p ] ) : it is simply the product of the largest eigenvalues of @xmath321 and @xmath322 , which are @xmath323 and @xmath324 respectively .",
    "this would yield @xmath325 .",
    "although this is the precise value of @xmath11 implied by the sle results @xcite , the loop model can not be the @xmath8 model",
    ". the weight per loop has @xmath326 ( e.g.@xmath327 for the @xmath0 wzw model ) in general , and the @xmath8 model in this regime",
    "does not have a critical point . since the underlying lattice model is critical",
    ", a non - critical loop model obviously can not be an equivalent description .",
    "the fact that domain walls can cross or touch must affect the continuum behavior of the loop model .",
    "the fact that the weight of non - crossing loops is the same as the sle results is quite encouraging .",
    "the task is then to use the boltzmann weights of the height model to understand how to treat the crossings .",
    "the fully packed loops do intersect , and affect the topological weight via the chromatic polynomial .",
    "the dilute loops behave differently . the decomposition ( [ a2p ] ) suggests that for @xmath31 the domain walls should not be treated as a single lines , but instead split into _ two _ lines , _ each _ of which behaves as a @xmath32 model .",
    "the key to defining a topological weight is the relabeling of the ground states as @xmath328 as described above . in this relabeling ,",
    "the @xmath312 and @xmath225 labels behave independently , as far as the adjacency restrictions on the ground states are concerned . since the domain walls are between the ground states , this means the domain walls in the @xmath312 and @xmath225 labels can be treated independently .",
    "thus the domain walls can be split into a `` solid '' wall and a `` dashed '' wall , as illustrated in figure [ fig : dilute - k ] . away from where the domain walls meet , this",
    "splitting is unimportant , and the solid and dashed lines are attached .",
    "however , at a domain - wall crossing there are now _ four _ ways of resolving the lines so that lines of the same type do not cross .",
    "these are illustrated in figure [ fig : dilute - resolve ] .",
    "the dashed line is a domain wall in the @xmath329 theory ( the @xmath312 index in @xmath330 ) , while the solid line corresponds to a domain wall in the @xmath331 model ( the @xmath225 index in @xmath330 )",
    ".    note that dashed lines never cross or touch each other , and likewise for solid , but that the dashed and solid can cross one another .",
    "thus a loop configuration consists of dashed and solid loops which are sewn together , except when two loops meet on one plaquette .",
    "at each domain - wall crossing , one of the four possibilities in figure [ fig : dilute - resolve ] must occur .",
    "a typical loop configuration is illustrated in figure [ fig : dilute - k ] . since the restrictions on the @xmath312 and @xmath225 labels are completely independent , it is consistent to treat the dashed and solid domain walls independently .    all the configurations in the height model can therefore be realized in terms of a pair of @xmath32 domain walls .",
    "the last two domain - wall configurations in figure [ fig : dilute - resolve ] are necessary to realize configurations like ( [ plaquettes ] ) that occur for @xmath31 .",
    "this follows from rewriting the ground states around the plaquette in terms of @xmath304 .",
    "for example , @xmath332 and @xmath333",
    ". therefore they have the same @xmath312 value and are not separated by any dashed lines . likewise @xmath334 and",
    "@xmath335 so these have the same @xmath225 value and are not separated by any solid lines .",
    "this picture is in remarkable accord with the field - theory results for the ( @xmath33 ) superconformal minimal models perturbed along the integrable line of interest .",
    "the particles in the field theory have the same labels as the defects , so the particle world - lines can again be identified with the domain walls . moreover , the scattering matrix @xmath336 is a product of @xmath32 scattering matrices @xcite , just like the ground - state adjacency matrices .",
    "it is @xmath337 plugging the @xmath32 scattering matrices from ( [ smat ] ) into ( [ s2p ] ) shows that @xmath336 is a sum of four terms , involving @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 , and @xmath341 .",
    "recalling the graphical representation of @xmath93 and @xmath94 in figure [ fig : tl ] gives precisely the four possibilities in figure [ fig : dilute - resolve ] for the particle world - lines .",
    "it is now clear how to build a topological weight for these dilute loops .",
    "the dashed and solid lines each form closed loops .",
    "the sum over heights can be done independently for the @xmath312 and @xmath225 labels for each ground state .",
    "the weight per dashed loop is then simply the largest eigenvalue of the @xmath321 adjacency matrix , which is @xmath170 .",
    "the weight per solid loop is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath322 , which is @xmath324 . when the numbers of dashed and solid loops are @xmath19 and @xmath9 respectively , the topological weight is @xmath342 the topological invariant @xmath343 is the number of times the ( original ) domain walls cross , i.e. the number of plaquettes which have one of the configurations in figure [ fig : dilute - resolve ] at their center .",
    "the piece involving the parameter @xmath26 is analogous to the last piece of the fully packed weight ( [ wchrome ] ) .",
    "the arguments here are not refined enough to determine the value of @xmath26 , or whether changing it results in a relevant or irrelevant perturbation of the critical point .",
    "the ground states for general @xmath17 are quite analogous to those for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the expression ( [ pq],[eh ] ) for the local height probabilities still holds , so the minimum of @xmath188 occurs when the heights on every other site are the same .",
    "thus each ground state can be labeled by two heights @xmath64 and @xmath248 , which must satisfy the constraints for nearest - neighbor heights in ( [ constraints ] ) .    for general @xmath17 and @xmath29 integer",
    ", the adjacency matrix decomposes into tensor products of @xmath32 adjacency matrix .",
    "this follows by relabeling the ground states @xmath344 into the form @xmath304 via @xmath345 the constraints in ( [ constraints ] ) in terms of @xmath312 and @xmath225 are therefore quite simply @xmath346 and @xmath347 .",
    "a fundamental defect needs to have energy @xmath348 in ( @xmath349 ) .",
    "this only occurs if the two ground states have one of their height labels in common , and one different .",
    "namely , a fundamental defect separates the ground state @xmath344 from the ground states @xmath350 and @xmath351 . in terms of @xmath312 and @xmath225 labels , this means that a fundamental defect separates @xmath304 from the states @xmath352 and @xmath353 .",
    "thus the restrictions on @xmath312 and @xmath225 are independent of each other , and the adjacency matrix for the ground states for general @xmath17 and @xmath29 is simply @xmath354 this is in harmony with the scattering matrix for the quasiparticles in the field theory describing the integrable line , which is @xcite @xmath355 this also is in harmony with the coulomb - gas approach to these conformal field theories , which gives their partition functions as sums of products of minimal - model ones @xcite .",
    "the configurations in the dilute loop model for general @xmath17 are therefore the same as for @xmath33 model .",
    "the defect world - lines become `` double '' domain walls in the two - dimensional picture .",
    "crossings are resolved in the four ways in figure ( [ fig : dilute - resolve ] ) , so the typical configuration displayed in figure [ fig : dilute - k ] still is applicable here .",
    "the weight for the dashed loops for general @xmath17 is now the largest eigenvalue of @xmath356 , which is @xmath357 .",
    "this yields the topological weights given in ( [ wnm],[nm ] ) .",
    "in this paper i have shown how to turn lattice models into loop models .",
    "dense loop models are found directly by exploiting the algebraic structure of the transfer matrix , while dilute loops are the domain walls found more indirectly using the corner transfer matrix and the scattering matrix .",
    "since these lattice models have critical points described by known coset conformal field theories , this means that the loop models have these same critical points as well",
    ".    it would be interesting to show directly that the dilute loop models have these critical points .",
    "one way of doing so would be to study the `` dilute bmw models '' @xcite .",

    "the corner transfer matrix computation for these models has not yet been done , so it is not yet known if these models have the critical points described in this paper .",
    "it would also of course be interesting to generalize these results to other loop models and conformal field theories .",
    "another loop model with a critical point described by the conformal minimal models was discussed at length in [ ] . this dilute loop model can be derived from the potts lattice model from both the domain - wall and the algebraic approach ( using projection operators instead of @xmath360 and @xmath188 ) , but the heuristic approach used there is more suggestive .",
    "this is the scattering matrix approach used above , where the world lines of the particles in the field theory are identified with the loops .",
    "as mentioned briefly in [ ] , the scattering matrix approach suggests that the dilute version of the fully packed @xmath33 model discussed above will have critical points described by parafermion conformal field theories .",

    "define the operator @xmath375 which acts on a zig - zag row of heights as illustrated in figure [ fig : diag ] , acting on a set of heights @xmath376 .",
    "@xmath377 is normalized so that @xmath378",
    ". then the partition function for @xmath379 zig - zag rows is @xmath380 where @xmath381 means the matrix element which has all the heights in the first and last rows fixed to be @xmath382 .",
    "the fact that @xmath383 involves only @xmath384 and @xmath385 for the left- and right - most columns means that all the heights along the sides are fixed to the same values .    to relate this definition of @xmath386 with that coming from the loops , expand @xmath383 in terms of the temperley - lieb generators , as done for the fully packed loop models .",
    "each of the resulting terms corresponds to a loop configuration @xmath3 , and consists of many @xmath86 sandwiched in between the @xmath377s .",
    "consider one of these terms , which gets weight @xmath387 in the loop model , and @xmath388 in the height model .",
    "then using the algebra ( [ tlalg ] ) , i show here that @xmath389 when computing @xmath390 the @xmath86 in @xmath377 are drawn with only one loop : the piece that goes `` off the edge '' is ignored .",
    "the relation ( [ aba ] ) shows that up to an overall constant , the partition functions are the same : @xmath391    let @xmath68 be an integer . because @xmath392 and all @xmath393 commute with each other , @xmath394 thus any time an @xmath393 is next to @xmath377 , it can be removed , leaving an overall factor @xmath98 .",
    "now consider an @xmath395 somewhere in the middle .",
    "all one needs to do to get rid of it is to get the @xmath396s from the @xmath397 next to the @xmath395 , and then use @xmath398 . since @xmath396 commutes with everything other than @xmath395 , the only obstruction to doing this is the product is of the form @xmath399 where @xmath396 does not appear in the dots .",
    "since there are no @xmath396s in the dots , @xmath395 can be commuted through the dots and @xmath400 used , unless there is an @xmath401 within the dots , i.e.  the product is of the form @xmath402 the offending @xmath401 can then be eliminated using the @xmath403s unless there is an @xmath404 which interferes .",
    "thus either the offending ones can be eliminated , or one ends up with @xmath405 but then this can be reduced by using @xmath406 and so on . proceeding like this one can eliminate all of them , leaving @xmath407 where @xmath9 is an integer independent of representation .",
    "in fact , @xmath9 is the number of closed loops in the graphical representation of @xmath3 .",
    "this proves ( [ aba ] ) and ( [ zbz ] ) for any representation of the @xmath86 , as long as it satisfies the temperley - lieb algebra .    for the loop models based on the @xmath259 bmw algebra , the @xmath94 in @xmath377 are replaced with @xmath188 .",
    "the arguments then go through as above .",
    "this appendix collects formulas connected to the @xmath259 bmw algebra .",
    "much of this appendix is discussed in depth in [ ] , and what is not can be obtained by using these results along with the explicit boltzmann weights for the @xmath33 rsos models @xcite .    the generators @xmath256 and @xmath257 can be defined in terms of the temperley - lieb generators by using the projectors @xmath408 onto the spin-1 representation of @xmath224 , giving @xcite @xmath409 representations of the @xmath259 bmw algebra therefore can be found from representation of the temperley - lieb algebra simply by plugging into ( [ extl ] ) . in particular , a graphical representation in terms of non - crossing loops can be found from the pictures in figure [ fig : tl ] @xcite .    the @xmath259 bmw algebra is usually written in terms of @xmath257 and @xmath410 , where @xmath410 is a braiding operator ( i.e.  satisfies @xmath411 ) . here",
    "it is convenient to write them in terms of @xmath360 , and @xmath188 ; the expression for @xmath412 in terms of these can be found in [ ] .",
    "the @xmath257 satisfy the temperley - lieb algebra amongst themselves : @xmath413 relations involving the @xmath273 are : @xmath414 and @xmath415 all relations also hold with @xmath65 and @xmath416 interchanged , and with the order of products in each term reversed .",
    "all generators labeled by sites @xmath65 and @xmath68 commute when @xmath417 .",
    "it is instructive to use the graphical representation in figure [ fig : ixe ] to verify these relations .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath188 and @xmath273 in the @xmath33 height representation discussed in this paper can be found either by substituting ( [ ersos ] ) into ( [ extl ] ) , or from the explicit boltzmann weights .",
    "since the @xmath257 satisfy the temperley - lieb algebra , they end up satisfying the identical relation as the @xmath86 , the only difference being that the heights here are always even , with the adjacency rules in ( [ constraints ] ) for @xmath33 .",
