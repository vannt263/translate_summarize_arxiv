    "one of the prime objectives of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to probe directly the ewsb sector .",
    "the analysis of partial wave unitarity of longitudinal weak boson scattering guarantees that there should exist a new state at the tev scale or that this process becomes strongly interacting at high energies  @xcite . in several extensions of the standard model ( sm )",
    "the new resonances associated to the unitarity restoration are expected to have spin 1 .",
    "for instance , in higgsless models a tower of spin1 particles is responsible for cutting off the growth of the electroweak gauge boson scattering amplitude without the presence of any scalar ( higgs ) field  @xcite .",
    "another attractive possibility is that the electroweak symmetry breaking is associated to a new strongly interacting sector  @xcite .",
    "these models also exhibit new vector states that contribute to the unitarization of the weak gauge boson scattering  @xcite .",
    "thus , a common feature of many ewsb scenarios , as the ones above mentioned , is the existence of new vector resonances , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , that couple to @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairs respectively .",
    "but , generically , their properties , such as mass , width , and couplings to sm particles , are model dependent . in this respect ,",
    "the _ model independent _ channels for detection of such spin-1 resonances would be their production via weak boson fusion ( wbf ) or its associated production with an electroweak gauge boson , since both processes only involve their couplings to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "unfortunately for a @xmath5 these signals are unobservable in a clean purely leptonic channel at lhc even with increased luminosity   @xcite , while @xmath6 can be observed in the wbf @xmath9 elastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "once a clear signal of the charged resonance is observed in the above channels , it is mandatory to study its spin to confirm that the new state is indeed a vector particle .",
    "much work has been devoted in the literature over the last years to this issue  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the wbf process can be used to determine the spin of a @xmath6 resonance at lhc , however , only for relatively light resonances and with the assumption of increased luminosity  @xcite .",
    "alternatively the new spin-1 states can also be directly produced in @xmath10 collisions via its coupling to light quarks and in order to establish that such new vector bosons are indeed associated with ewsb one should analyze processes in which the new spin-1 decays into electroweak gauge boson  @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the lhc potential to determine the spin of a new resonance responsible for the unitarization of weak boson scattering amplitude by the study of the processes @xmath11    instead of assuming a specific model for ewsb we express our results as a function of the relevant couplings of the new neutral ( charged ) resonance to light quarks and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) pairs , and of its width and mass .",
    "the spin assignment of the new resonances is obtained from the spin correlation between the final state leptons , contrasting the expected results for spin1 and spin0 new states , _",
    "i.e. _ we work in the framework commonly used to analyze the spin of supersymmetric particles  @xcite .",
    "we also study the angular distribution of the produced ew gauge bosons in the @xmath12 center of mass . in order to do",
    "so one needs to reconstruct the neutrino momenta for the processes ( [ processes ] ) . for the topology @xmath13 , associated with the @xmath14 production ,",
    "the neutrino longitudinal momentum was obtained requiring that it is compatible with the production of an on - shell @xmath15 . to reconstruct the momenta of the two neutrinos coming from @xmath16 production we used the @xmath17 assisted on - shell ( maos ) reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "we show that the best sensitivity is obtained by directly studying the final state leptons and we quantify the correlated ranges of @xmath12 couplings , masses , widths and collider luminosity for which the spin of the resonance can be established at a given cl .",
    "in order to study the processes ( [ processes ] ) we must know the couplings of the new resonance to light quarks and electroweak gauge bosons , as well as its mass and width . here",
    "we will consider that these are free parameter without restricting ourselves to any specific model .",
    "however , for the sake of concreteness we assume that the couplings of the @xmath16 and the @xmath14 to the light quarks and to gauge bosons have the same lorentz structure as those of the sm , as suggested by the higgsless models , but with arbitrary strength . furthermore , we vetoed the @xmath16 coupling to @xmath18 pairs as it happens in this class of models .",
    "the partial wave amplitude for the process @xmath19 is saturated by the exchange of a @xmath16 provided its coupling to electroweak gauge bosons satisfies  @xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the strength of the sm triple gauge boson coupling . here",
    "@xmath22 stands for the @xmath23 coupling constant and @xmath24 is the cosine of the weak mixing angle .",
    "analogously , a charged vector resonance saturates unitarity of the scattering @xmath9 for  @xcite @xmath25 in what follows we use @xmath26 and @xmath27 simply as convenient normalizations for the coupling of the spin-1 resonance to sm gauge bosons .    the width of the new spin1 resonances receives contributions from its decay to light quarks and electroweak gauge boson pairs , as well as into other states , like @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in this work we treat the @xmath5 and @xmath6 widths as a free parameters . in this approach , for each final state the analysis depends on three parameters : the mass of the resonance , @xmath30 ; its width , @xmath31 ; and the product of its couplings to light quarks and to sm gauge bosons , @xmath32 .",
    "these parameters are only subject to the constraint that for a given value of product of the couplings of the new resonance and of its mass , there is lower bound on its width that reads  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "within our approach we can express the cross section for the processes ( [ processes ] ) as @xmath36 where the standard model , interference and new resonance contributions are labeled @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "moreover , for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 while for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    by construction",
    "our analysis applies to any @xmath39 whose couplings to the sm u- and d - quarks and to the sm gauge bosons are a simple rescaling of the w or z couplings . conversely the analysis renders limited information on the underlying physics associated to the new resonances unless combined with information from other channels for the observation of these states . for instance , the processes ( [ processes ] ) give information on the couplings to light quark pairs and electroweak gauge bosons . analyzing the weak boson fusion production of these particles allow us to disentangle the couplings to gauge bosons and quarks .",
    "certainly additional information can be gathered by studying further channel like the associated production with a gauge boson or the new resonance decay into leptons .",
    "we perform our analyses at the parton level , keeping the full helicity structure of the amplitude .",
    "this is achieved using the package madgraph  @xcite modified to include the new vector states and their couplings . in our calculations we use cteq6l parton distribution functions",
    "@xcite with renormalization and factorization scales @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the transverse momentum of the two charged leptons in the @xmath5 decay or of the two different flavor opposite sign leptons in the @xmath6 decay . for the case of @xmath6 decaying into three equal flavor leptons",
    "we choose the two opposite sign leptons whose invariant mass is not compatible with being the decay products of a @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , we simulate experimental resolutions by smearing the energies , but not directions , of all final state leptons with a gaussian error given by a resolution @xmath49(@xmath50 in gev ) .",
    "we also consider a lepton detection efficiency of @xmath51 .",
    "we analyzed @xmath14 production in the channel @xmath52 with @xmath53 or @xmath3 .",
    "the main sm backgrounds are the production of electroweak gauge boson pairs @xmath8 and @xmath18 with its subsequent leptonic decay . in the @xmath18 production one of the final state leptons",
    "must evade detection .",
    "the sm production of top quarks can also lead to trilepton final states , however , this process is rather suppressed since one of the isolated leptons must originate from the semi - leptonic decay of a b quark .",
    "the starting cuts are meant to ensure the detection and isolation of the final leptons plus a minimum transverse momentum : @xmath54 next , we look for a same flavor opposite charge lepton pair that is compatible with a @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath55 we also demand in the search for the resonance that the hardest observed lepton has transverse momentum in excess of 120 gev in order to tame the sm backgrounds .    in this process",
    "the neutrino momentum can be reconstructed up to a two  fold ambiguity : its transverse momentum can be directly obtained from momentum conservation in the transverse directions while its longitudinal component can be inferred by requiring that @xmath56 , which leads to @xmath57 p_l^l \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\pm   \\sqrt{\\big[m_w^2 + 2(\\vec{p_t^l } \\cdot \\vec{{/\\!\\!\\!\\!p_t}})\\big]^2 |\\vec p^l|^2 - 4 ( p_t^l e^l{/\\!\\!\\!\\!e_t})^2}\\bigg\\ } \\label{eq : plnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the four - momentum of the charged lepton not associated to the @xmath48 . with the two values of the reconstructed neutrino momenta",

    "we have also explored the expected distribution of the @xmath15 polar angle in the @xmath7 center  of  mass frame as reconstructed using the different maos prescriptions . as an illustration we depict , in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ang : zp ] , the reconstructed @xmath163 spectrum for the production of spin0 and spin1 resonances and our three reference masses as obtained from the maos - original momentum prescription with sign + + in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maoslo ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the distributions of the two angular variables presented in this figure indicates that these variables are correlated .",
    "indeed they are strongly correlated as can be seen in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : scat ] .",
    "consequently , as in the @xmath14 case , we can foresee a similar spin discriminating power for both variables on the basis of statistics .",
    "we have verified that the same conclusion is reached when using either the maos - original momentum prescription with sign @xmath164 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maoslo ] ) , the average of the distributions with @xmath165 and @xmath166 signs , or the maos - modified prescription ( [ eq : maoslm ] ) .",
    "spin determination can be done at 99% cl for an integrated luminosity for 100 fb@xmath4 using the asymmetry @xmath105.,width=336 ]    we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : disczp : ll ] the @xmath16 parameter space region where the lhc can establish its spin with 99% cl using @xmath105 for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath4 . as in the @xmath14 case ,",
    "the minimum couplings needed for the spin determination are approximated twice the ones required for the @xmath16 discovery .",
    "moreover , the minimum couplings required for the spin determination exhibit a very mild dependence on the resonance mass since the acceptance cut effects are smaller for heavier states , compensating , partially , the decrease in the production cross section .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : lum : zp ] the required integrated luminosity for a 5@xmath74 discovery ( solid lines ) and 99% cl spin determination based on ( [ eq : spindis ] ) ( dashed lines ) for our three reference masses and two widths ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) as a function of the @xmath5 couplings .",
    "we find that for a given value of the @xmath5 couplings the required luminosity for 99% cl spin determination based on the study of @xmath105 is a factor @xmath169 20 ( 10 ) \\{9 } larger than the one required for 5@xmath74 discovery for @xmath137 ( 1000 ) \\{1500 } gev and that these factors are almost independent of @xmath170 .",

    "we present the results for three masses and two widths : @xmath167 and @xmath168.,width=336 ]",
    "in this work we have performed a model independent analysis of the lhc potential to unravel the spin of new charged and neutral vector resonances associated with the ewsb sector that are predicted in many extensions of the sm .",
    "the production of a charged vector resonance leads to trilepton final states and we showed that the study of the @xmath86 and the reconstructed @xmath93 distributions yield similar discriminating power for the spin of the new state .",
    "we find that the study of the trilepton channel can lead to a 99% cl determination of the new charged state spin in a large fraction of the parameter space where this state can be observed at the lhc for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath4 . as an illustration ,",
    "let us consider the case of higgsless models  @xcite where the @xmath14 mass is expected to be lighter than 1 tev and that @xmath171 the range of these parameters indicates that this new state should be observed with an integrated luminosity of the order of 10 fb@xmath4 , while the determination of its spin should require a few tens fb@xmath4 .",
    "the analyses for the neutral spin1 resonances was carried out using the production of opposite charge dileptons .",
    "it turns out that the sm background in this case can be efficiently reduced , however , it is not completely eliminated by the cuts , consequently leading to a larger required luminosity for the discovery and determination of the spin of the neutral new particles .",
    "we considered two methods for the reconstruction of the final state neutrinos ( and consequently of the @xmath5 mass ) maos - original and maos - modified , that lead to similar results .",
    "we find that the variables @xmath99 and @xmath163 with @xmath163 reconstructed with any of the maos methods lead to equivalent precision in the spin determination of the @xmath16 .",
    "analogously to the @xmath14 case , the 99% cl determination of the neutral resonance spin can be carried out in a large fraction of the discovery parameter space for a fixed integrated luminosity . in the particular case of higgsless models",
    "@xcite , the @xmath16 mass is expected to be smaller than 1 tev and its couplings @xmath172 which implies that an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath4 should be enough for a @xmath16 discovery and to unravel its spin .",
