    "this makes it difficult to ascertain whether this enormous energy output is due to a starburst activity or an accretion process onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "one of the best known objects to study this relationship is the nearby ulirg ngc  6240 ( assuming @xmath2 ) .",
    "infrared observations favour an energy source dominated by starburst processes , whereas observations in the x - ray range point to an agn as the central engine ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we have analyzed the data of ngc  6240 taken from an 24 ksec observation with _ xmm - newton _ using the epic - pn and epic - mos instruments . in order to investigate the fe line complex around 6.4 kev and the 0.3 - 10.0 kev spectrum as a whole the high sensitivity and",
    "therefore the good photon statistics - especially in the 6.4 kev range - in combination with a higher energy resolution enables us to examine this feature in unprecedented detail .",
    "table 1 summarizes some basic parameters ( powerlaw - @xmath4 , line energies ) of different models ( first column ) after fitting to the data .",
    "the first of the leading three models includes line profiles with no line width ( @xmath5 ) , whereas eachone of the last two models uses a second powerlaw , but with a different number of line profiles .",
    "each model contains a 6.4kev line as an indication of an agn contribution .",
