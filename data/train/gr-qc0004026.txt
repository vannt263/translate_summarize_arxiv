    "the term _ causality _ is frequently used in a way which suggests that an intrinsic causal structure underlies the universe . in relativity",
    "this is reinforced by the assumption of a metric tensor with a lorentzian signature .",
    "this gives the traditional light cone structure associated with spacelike and timelike intervals , and imposes conditions on the possible trajectories of particles and quantum field theory operator commutation relations .",
    "we shall discuss the idea that _ causality is a convenient account designed to satisfy and conform to the patterns of classical logic that the human theorist wishes to believe underlies the dynamics of space , time and matter .",
    "_ in this approach causality need not be associated with any _ a priori _ concept of metric tensor .",
    "this view of causality has been suggested by various philosophers and scientists .",
    "hume argued that causality is a fiction of the mind .",
    "he said that causal reasoning is due to the mind s expectation that the future is like the past and because people have always associated an effect with a cause .",
    "kant believed that causality is a category used to classify experience .",
    "lentzen said that causality is a relation within the realm of conceptual objects .",
    "lurchin said that causality is a personal way of thought that is not among our immediate sensual data , but is rather our basic way to organize that data . for maxwell",
    "the principle of causality expresses the general objective of theoretical sciences to achieve deterministic explanations@xmath0 and according to heisenberg , causality only applies to mathematical representations of reality and not to individual mechanical systems .",
    "to avoid confusion we distinguish three sorts of time :    @xmath1  _ process time _ is the hypothesized time of physical reality .",
    "although there is geological and astrophysical evidence for some sort of temporal ordering in reality @xcite , process time need not exist in any real sense and may just be a convenient way for humans to think about the universe .",
    "@xmath2  _ physiotime _ is the subjective time that humans sense and which they believe runs monotonically forwards for them .",
    "it is the end product of complex bio - dynamical processes occurring in process time .",
    "its origins are not understood currently .",
    "many physicists believe that this feeling is an illusion .",
    "what matters here is the undeniable _ existence _ of this feeling , because humans are driven by this sensation of an ever increasing time to believe that descriptions of reality must involve such a concept .",
    "@xmath3  _ mathematical times _ are conceptual inventions of human theorists designed to model process time .",
    "examples are newtonian absolute time , relativistic coordinate times , proper time and cosmic time .",
    "mathematical times usually involve subsets of the real line , which has an ordering property .",
    "this ordering is used to model the notions of _ earlier _ and _ later . _",
    "this presupposes something about the nature of process time that may be unwarranted . in the euclidean formulation of field theory for example",
    "there is no dynamical ordering parameter .",
    "we shall use the term _ theorist _ to denote the human mind operating at its clearest and most rational in physiotime .",
    "the theorist has the status of an observer or deity overseeing the mathematically consistent development of chosen mathematical models that are used to represent phenomena in process time .",
    "_ free will",
    "_ enters into the discussion here as the freedom of the theorist to choose boundary conditions in these models . whether free will is an illusion or not is regarded here as irrelevant",
    "the need to seek causal explanations stems from the peculiarities of human consciousness .",
    "humans generally want to _ explain _ phenomena .",
    "when they do this they invariably try to invoke what may be called _ classical logic .",
    "_ this is the everyday logic that postulates that statements are _ either true or else false _ and that conclusions can be drawn from given premises .",
    "it is also the logic of vision , which generally informs the brain that an object either is in a place or else is not in that place .",
    "the rational conscious mind tends to believe that the external universe follows this logic , and this is the basis for the construction of cm ( classical mechanics ) and all the belief structures which it encodes into its view of reality .",
    "it is also the logic of jurisprudence and common sense .",
    "this logic served humanity extremely well for millennia , until technological advances in the early years of the twentieth century revealed that quantum phenomena did not obey this logic in detail .",
    "a cm theorist is anyone who believes in a classical view of reality . in the mindset of a cm theorist , reality",
    "is assumed to be strictly single valued at each and every time even in the absence of observation .",
    "philosophers say that reality is determinate__. _ _ the cm theorist attempts to make unique predictions wherever possible , such as where a planet will be at a future time .",
    "the assumption is made that the planet will be somewhere at that time and not nowhere , and that it will not be in two or more places at that time .    in general",
    ", quantum theory requires a pre - existing classical conceptual framework for a sensible interpretation .",
    "for example , relativistic quantum field theory assumes a classical lorentzian metric over spacetime , and only the fields are quantised .",
    "for this reason , we shall focus our attention on a classical formulation of causality .",

    "a more severe definition of causality however might be to impose the restriction of computability .",
    "we do not do this here because we wish to avoid anthropomorphism .",
    "what is important in classical mechanics is the existence of a unique resolution ; the universe does not actually `` compute '' anything when this resolution occurs .",
    "it is possible to consider links which are not equations but more general relations such as inequalities .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath11 and @xmath7 are copies of the real line with elements denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath12 respectively and consider a link defined by @xmath47 given @xmath10 there is an infinity of solutions for @xmath12 , so in this case one possible interpretation would be that the link is equivalent to a many valued function of @xmath10 , although this way of putting things might seem unusual .",
    "on the other hand , given a @xmath12 there is also an infinity of solutions for @xmath10 .",
    "this leads to an alternative interpretation of the link as a many valued function of @xmath12 .",
    "such examples do not generate a classical tra ( temporal resolution of alternatives ) and so would not occur normally in our classical spacetime dynamics .",
    "now suppose we were given an implicit equation for @xmath10 and @xmath12 such that we could prove the existence of a unique solution for either @xmath10 or @xmath12 given the other variable .",
    "then the arrows could point either way and this would correspond to a choice of causation . because cause and effect can be interchanged in such a case",
    ", it then becomes meaningful to talk about this dynamics being _ reversible .",
    "_ clearly this is formally equivalent to having an invertible explicit function .",
    "when discussed in this way it becomes clear that in general , spacetime dynamics will be irreversible .",
    "reversibility will occur only under very special conditions , which of course is the experience of experimentalists .",
    "in general the sets @xmath11 and @xmath7 need not be restricted to the reals .",
    "they could be any sort of sets , such as vector spaces , tensor product spaces , quaternions , operator rings , group manifolds , etc .",
    "whatever their nature , they will always be referred to as _ events _ for convenience . in the sorts of dynamics we have in mind events",

    "_ links _ are defined as specific relationships between events .",
    "they may be more complicated than those in the above examples , and may have several or many components relating different components of different events .",
    "the specification of a set of events and corresponding links will be said to specify a ( classical ) _ spacetime dynamics .  _",
    "an important generalization is that a link might involve more than two events .",

    "@xmath49 , and @xmath49 will be called the _ resolved event_.    by definition , classical resolution is always in favour of a single resolved event , given initial data about the other events associated with the link .",
    "this does not imply anything about the possibility of resolving @xmath34 _ _  _ _ in favour of any of these other events",
    ". it may be or not be possible to do this .",
    "suppose the theorist could in principle resolve @xmath49 if they were given @xmath60 and @xmath51 , and also resolve @xmath48 if they were given @xmath61 and @xmath51 .",
    "then the theorist has to make a choice of resolution and choose one possible resolution and exclude the other .",
    "it would not be meaningful classically to resolve @xmath34 in favour of @xmath49 and @xmath48 at the same moment of physiotime , the reason being that these alternative resolutions employ different and inconsistent initial data sets ( boundary conditions ) .",
    "initial data sets are equivalent to information , and it is a self - evident premise that a theorist can have at most one initial data set from a collection of possible and mutually inconsistent initial data sets at a given moment of physiotime .",
    "there remains one additional exotic possibility .",
    "if might be the case that given say @xmath62 and @xmath49 , both @xmath58 and @xmath51 were implied by a knowledge of the link .",
    "for example , suppose the link was equivalent to the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "assuming that @xmath65 and @xmath17 were always required to be real , then we could always find @xmath19 and @xmath17 from a given @xmath66 and @xmath67 simply by equating real and imaginary parts .",
    "a situation where a given link can be resolved in two or more events given just one initial data set at that link will be called a _ fluctuation process . _",
    "fluctuation processes will be excluded from our notion of classical causality .",
    "they may have a role in the qm ( quantum mechanics ) version of causality , which is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "one reason for excluding fluctuation processes is that this guarantees that information flows ( in physiotime ) from a link into a _",
    "single _ event .",
    "this is related to the concept of _ cosmic time _",
    "discussed below and to the idea that classical mathematical time has one dimension .",
    "when theorists discuss models with more than one parameter called a time , all but one of these has to be hidden or eliminated at the end of the day if a classical picture is to emerge .",
    "it may be argued therefore that _ the mechanism of classical resolution is the origin of the concept of time , and that time , like causality , is a no more than a convenient theoretical construct designed by the human mind to provide a coherent description of physical reality . _",
    "this carries no implication that what we called process time is really a linear time . as we said before",
    ", process time is just a convenient label for something which may be quite different to what we believe it to be .    when a choice of resolution exists and is made , then as an additional simplification and provided there is no confusion with other relations to which @xmath49 may be a party ( not shown ) , the diagram on the lhs of @xmath59 may be replaced by the rhs of @xmath59 .",
    "here the numbers zero and one indicate the ordering of the resolution . because @xmath49 may be regarded as _ caused _ by the other events , it can be regarded as later and so has a greater associated discrete time .",
    "such times will be called _",
    "dates_.    in general a link may be a whole collection of relations and equations .",
    "if there is just one small part of these equations which does not determine a unique solution fully , i.e. , prevents a resolution , then arrows or dates are in principle not permitted .",
    "however , under some circumstances it may be reasonable to ignore some part of a dynamical relation in such a way that arrows could be justified as far as the remaining parts were concerned .",
    "for example , the microscopic laws of mechanics appear to be resolvable forwards and backwards in time ( i.e. , are reversible ) provided the `` small '' matter of neutral kaon decays and the thermodynamic arrow of time ( which could involve the gravitational field @xcite ) are ignored .    in @xmath30 , @xmath11 is the _ complete cause _ of @xmath7 ; in @xmath59 , @xmath7 is a _ partial cause _ of @xmath49 .",
    "the _ complete cause _ of @xmath49 is the collection of events @xmath7 , @xmath48 , @xmath58 and @xmath51 , but only for this choice of resolution .",
    "the theorist could decide to alter boundary conditions so that @xmath68 was no longer regarded as the resolved event .",
    "having outlined our ideas on functions and links , we shall apply them now to discrete spacetime .",
    "fourier s _ principle of similitude _ states that a system @xmath69 similar to but smaller than another system @xmath48 should behave like @xmath70 it is the physicist s analogue of continuity in mathematics , and is of course an erroneous principle when applied to matter , as evidenced by the observation of atoms and molecules .",
    "it is generally supposed that this principle will also break down in the microscopic description of space and time .",
    "classical gr ( general relativity ) may therefore be an approximation , albeit a remarkably good approximation , to some model of space and time which is not intrinsically a four - dimensional pseudo - riemannian manifold .",
    "there have been numerous suggestions concerning the fundamental nature and meaning of space and time , such as twistor theory , point set theory , etc . ,",
    "@xcite and each of these suggestions makes a specific set of mathematical assumptions about spacetime .",
    "likewise , in this article a specific view of space time and dynamics is proposed and its consequences explored .",
    "of course , there is an important question concerning the use of classical or quantum physics here . in this paper",
    "the proposals are based on classical ideas and the ramifications of quantum physics are explored elsewhere .    from before the time of newton",
    ", physicists took the view that material objects have definite spatial positions at definite times . in the @xmath71century theorists went further and developed to the extreme the wellsian or block universe @xcite view that space and time exist in some physically meaningful sense , even in the absence of matter .",
    "whatever that sense is , be it a physical one or simply an approximate relationship of sorts between more complex attributes of reality , most physicists agree on the prime status of spacetime as the arena in which or over which physical objects exist .",
    "this is certainly the case for classical physicists and to various degrees for quantum physicists .    in this paper",
    "the focus is on a classical description of a _ discrete _ spacetime structure .",
    "discreteness is considered here for several reasons .",
    "first , as mentioned above , it would be too much to hope that fourier s principle of similitude should apply to spacetime and not to matter .",
    "second , there is a strong feeling in the subject of quantum gravity that the planck scales are significant .",
    "third , discreteness has the advantage over continuity in being less mathematically restrictive .",
    "theories based on discrete principles can usually encompass the properties of those based on continuous principles via appropriate limit processes , yet retain features which can not occur in the continuum .",
    "discrete spacetime structure and its relationship to causality has been discussed by a number of authors , notably by sorkin et al @xcite and finkelstein et al @xcite .",
    "a basic difference between those approaches and that taken here is that no _ a priori _ underlying spacetime manifold is assumed here .",
