    "analytical expressions of many feynman diagrams contain polylogarithmic functions of various kinds ( nielsen polylogarithms , harmonic polylogarithms@xcite , harmonic sums@xcite , multiple zeta values , euler sums@xcite , etc  ) .",
    "but there exist feynman integrals which can not be described only in terms of polylogarithms .    at two - loop level ,",
    "the discontinuity of the off - shell massive `` sunrise '' diagram with different masses is expressed by elliptic functions . at three ( or more ) loop level",
    "the situation worsens .",
    "these diagrams contain nested multiple elliptic integrals ; the current mathematical knowledge of such integrals is scarce or missing . at this preliminary stage ,",
    "_ `` experimental mathematics '' _ is the best tool . in other words , high - precision numerical values of the integrals",
    "are fitted@xcite with various candidate analytical expressions until an agreement is found .",
    "the equalities are then checked up to hundreds or thousands of digits . in this way the right analytical expression is identified beyond any reasonable doubt .",
    "this may be the starting point of the subsequent search for a rigorous proof of the result , task which may take months of hard work@xcite .    in ref .",
    "we work out a very high - precision value of the 3-loop scalar master integral of the `` sunrise '' diagram @xmath2 of fig.1 ; then we fit that value with products of elliptic integrals , checking the equality with a precision of thousand of digits .    in this paper",
    "we continue the work on the 3-loop integral , and we simplify the 3-loop analytic result by using some identities between elliptic integrals .",
    "next we review and develop the approach used for fitting and identifying the 3-loop integral and we apply it to the 4-loop scalar master integral of the `` sunrise '' diagram @xmath3 of fig.1 .",
    "the analytical calculation of this master integral is also of physical interest , because it is the simplest non - trivial master integral of the 4-loop electron @xmath0-@xmath1 ( of which a high - precision numerical calculation is under way@xcite ) .",
    "very likely , the analytical constants which appear in the expression of @xmath3 should also appear in the analytical expression of 4-loop @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "we calculate an high - precision value of @xmath3 and we are able to fit this value with an expression containing two new elliptic constants , checking the equality with a precision of thousand of digits .",
    "we apply this procedure also to the values of some 4-dimensional lattice integrals , and we identify their analytical expressions ; surprisingly , they contain the same elliptic constants of the 4-loop integral .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ treloop ] we simplify the results of ref .   by using identities between elliptic integrals . in section [ quattroloop ]",
    "we study the 4-loop `` sunrise '' integral .",
    "we collect a number of results on a `` simplified '' version of the integrals involved .",
    "then we use these results as a guide for identifying the candidate analytical expressions suitable for fitting the 4-loop results . in section [ risultati ]",
    "we show the analytical results found for the 4-loop integrals . in section [ quattrolattice ] we fit the values of some 4-dimensional lattice integrals with the same analytical constants discovered in the 4-loop integrals . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "in ref .   we considered the feynman diagram @xmath4 with equal masses @xmath5 , and on - shell external momentum ( see fig.1 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 by using an hyperspherical representation for the integral , we found that the value of @xmath2 could be expressed as a sum of various double elliptic integrals , the simplest being @xmath8 @xmath9 we were not able to calculate @xmath10 in analytical form .",
    "therefore we evaluated it at very high precision and we tried to fit the numerical value with various kinds of analytical expressions . in ref .",
    "we found that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the first of the two elliptic integrals @xmath13 we were able to fit the values of @xmath2 in 2 and 4 dimensions : @xmath14 @xmath15 , and were checked up to 30000 , 40000 and 1200 digits , respectively .",
    "now we note that the arguments @xmath16 of the elliptic integrals are _",
    "singular values_. in the context of elliptic integrals @xmath17 is a called singular value if @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an integer or a rational number .",
    "the arguments @xmath16 of elliptic integrals are singular values for @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , @xmath22 that is @xmath23 @xmath24 the values of elliptic integrals of second kind of are obtained following ref .",
    "@xmath25 by using the values  @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and expressing @xmath29 by using , we are able to rewrite and in the very compact form @xmath30 @xmath31 were also shown by david  broadhurst in his beautiful talk given in bielefeld@xcite . after the talk",
    ", our unpublished results were shown to david  broadhurst .",
    "for sake of completeness we recall here some unpublished observations that suggested us the form of .",
    "first we calculated analytically the _ simplest _ double elliptic integral : @xmath32 ^ 2= 3.437\\;592\\;909{\\ldots } \\ , \\ ] ] which factorizes in the square of the elliptic integral @xmath12 .",
    "then we observed that in the diagram @xmath33 the value of the square of the external momentum @xmath34 is @xmath35 , which is different from the threshold ( @xmath36 ) or the pseudothresholds ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we expected that the analytical expression is much simpler for the on - threshold diagram than for the off - threshold diagram .",
    "so we considered the above graph with one mass changed : @xmath38 .",
    "now the value of @xmath39 is on a pseudothreshold ( which are at @xmath40 ) .",
    "the integral analogous to @xmath10 is @xmath41 we were able to fit the numerical value of @xmath42 with @xmath43 ^ 2 = \\dfrac{\\gamma^6\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{2^\\frac{14}{3}\\pi^2}\\ .\\ ] ] subsequently , as we expected the form of @xmath10 to be more complicated than @xmath42 , we tried also products of @xmath12 with different arguments , and we found .",
    "now we consider the single - scale 4-loop self - mass diagram @xmath44 of fig.1 , in the case of equal masses @xmath5 and on shell external momentum @xmath39 .",
    "this diagram has 3 master integrals , the simplest being @xmath45 as already said in the introduction , this is also one of the several master integrals which appear in the calculation of 4-loop @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "the first observation is that , fortunately , the value of @xmath39 in @xmath3 is already on a pseudothreshold ( which are @xmath39,@xmath46,@xmath47 ) ; therefore to simplify the analytical structure of the integral we have not to use the mass change of the previous section [ tricka3 ] .",
    "we need an high - precision numerical value of this integral in order to obtain a meaningful fit .",
    "this is worked out by using the difference equation method presented in refs .  .",
    "summarizing , one raises to @xmath48 one denominator of @xmath49 the function @xmath50 satisfies the fourth - order difference equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the one - loop integral @xmath54 contains in the r.h.s . the integral",
    "obtained from @xmath3 by contracting one line , which factorizes into the product of 4 one - loop tadpoles .",
    "the solution of compatible with the large-@xmath48 boundary condition @xmath55 can be written as @xmath56 .",
    "the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are respectively the two solutions of the homogeneous equation compatible with the above large-@xmath48 behaviour and one particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation . the constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 are obtained from the 3-loop self - mass integrals belonging to the diagram obtained from @xmath3 by deleting one line , that is @xmath2 .",
    "the amount of calculations needed to work out and solve the systems of difference equations is high , so that the calculations have been performed by means of an automatic tool , the program described in ref .  .",
    "in two dimension one finds @xmath62 and in the limit @xmath63 @xmath64 all the above numerical constants were calculated with a precision of over 2400 digits ; for the sake of space we show here only the first 25 .      by using an hyperspherical representation for the integral , @xmath65 and",
    "the finite part of @xmath66 contain _ triple _ elliptic integrals , the simplest being @xmath67 we prefer to redistribute the arguments of the @xmath68 functions and consider the similar integral @xmath69 and the companion integral @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the two zeroes of @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 are the 4-loop integrals analogues of the 3-loop integral @xmath10 , and we have to find their analytical expressions .",
    "first of all we consider the simplest triple elliptic integral with structure similar to : @xmath75 by changing one limit of integration over @xmath76 to the zero of @xmath77 we obtain a companion integral analogous to @xmath78 we expect that the study of the simpler constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 can help us understand the analytical expressions of @xmath73 and @xmath74 . integrating over @xmath76 @xmath81 @xmath82 integrating over @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath85    @xmath86    no analytical expression",
    "is known for @xmath87 . trying to understand the reason of that , we study the following family of integrals :    @xmath88    we consider here only the integrals which have results containing elliptic constants . at the value",
    "@xmath89 there is the integral @xmath90 equivalent to ; note that it factorizes in a square of @xmath91 .    at the value @xmath92",
    "we find numerically that the six integrals @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 can be expressed in terms of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . at the value @xmath98",
    "we find a surprise : six integrals factorizes into the fourth power of @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 the analytical results have been fitted numerically and checked up to 200 digits of precision .",
    "we find results factorized at level 2 and 4 , but not at level 3 ( odd ) .",
    "this behaviour reminds us of the non - factorization of values of riemann @xmath106-function at odd integers , and suggest to consider the constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 as irreducible objects",
    ". we can relate @xmath79 and @xmath80 to multidimensional @xmath106-like quadruple series .",
    "let us consider the integrals @xmath107 these integrals correspond to the integrals , , , for @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath1 , respectively , and their values are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "we apply the change of variable @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the jacobi theta functions , then @xmath115 expanding in series the @xmath116 functions , and integrating over @xmath117 term - by - term , @xmath118 becomes a quadruple series @xmath119 for @xmath120 the series converges , so that @xmath121 where the prime means that the origin @xmath122 must be excluded in the summation .",
    "coming back to the 4-loop integral , if we close the 4-loop self - mass diagram @xmath3 by connecting together the two external lines , we obtain a 5-loop vacuum diagram .",
    "the 5-loop vacuum diagram can be decomposed into two 2-loop self - mass diagrams connected together .",
    "therefore in @xmath123 dimensions its value is given by the integral of the square of the 2-loop self - mass diagram @xmath124 .",
    "the vacuum diagram is expected to have the same analytical structure of @xmath3 , but with higher transcendentality .",
    "@xmath125 satisfies a second order nonhomogeneous differential equation ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "the corresponding homogeneous differential equation has two solutions @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "in order to reduce the transcendentality we may substitute @xmath125 with @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "the analytical expressions of @xmath128 and @xmath129 are given in the appendix of ref .  ; for example , if @xmath130 they read @xmath131 in ref .",
    "we found also that @xmath132 we consider here the integrals of products of @xmath133 : we have checked up to 2400-digits of precision the following equalities : @xmath134 and @xmath135 therefore we have identified some one - dimensional integral representations of the numerical constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "are not satisfactory elementary definitions of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , because of the complexity of the arguments of the @xmath12 function in .",
    "our aim is to find out integral representations of @xmath73 and @xmath74 as simple as and .",
    "we make a comparison between the integrals of products of @xmath12 of the family and the integrals of products of @xmath133 .",
    "corresponds to @xmath136 we try to modify the integrand of so that the result contains the constant @xmath137 .",
    "our many year experience with the analytical calculation of 3-loop @xmath0-@xmath1 suggests that such a constant is usually associated with integrals containing the polynomial @xmath138 in the denominator .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath139 .",
    "therefore we try to consider a `` cubic '' modification of the usual elliptic integral @xmath140 .",
    "one fruitful choice is @xmath141{(1-t^3)(1-mt^3)^2}}\\ , \\qquad e_c(m)=\\int_0 ^ 1 \\dfrac{dt\\;\\sqrt[3]{1-mt^3}}{\\sqrt[3]{1-t^3}}\\ , \\ ] ] or , equivalently , expressing them in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath142 now we calculate the numerical values of the integrals obtained by replacing @xmath12 with @xmath143 in , and we look for relations with the constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "luckily , we find @xmath144 we stress the tremendous simplification obtained by going from the usual description with elliptic integrals to the `` cubic '' version .",
    "for the sake of brevity we define the following constants @xmath145 now we look for relations between the numerical values of the above constants @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 and the numerical values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we find that @xmath151 or , alternatively , @xmath152 we note the appearance of the factor @xmath153 , similar to the appearance of @xmath154 in . by using the integer - relation search program",
    "pslq@xcite we have been able to fit the numerical result of with the analytical expression @xmath155 the equalities and are the main result of this paper ; they have been checked up to 2400 digits of precision .",
    "note that constant @xmath147 does not appear in and .",
    "considering lattice perturbation theory , at one loop level one finds these integrals@xcite @xmath156 and @xmath157 some years ago , while visiting the department of physics of parma , york schrder pointed out to the author that , whether 3-loop @xmath0-@xmath1 was known in analytical form , no analytical result was known for the `` simple '' lattice 1-loop tadpole @xmath158 .",
    "puzzled by this fact , and noting that @xmath158 can be reduced to a triple elliptic integral , we have tried to relate the numerical values of @xmath158 and @xmath159 to the new constants @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 . working with only 10-digits precision numbers",
    "we have discovered numerically that @xmath160 that is @xmath161 by using again pslq , we have also found that @xmath162 values of @xmath158 and @xmath159 with 400 digits of precision are quoted in ref .  .",
    "very kindly , york schrder provided us 16000-digits values . by using these numbers ,",
    "we have checked and up to 2400 digits of precision , the maximum precision of our values of @xmath146 and @xmath148 .",
    "we note also that the integral can be rewritten into the so - called watson integral in 4-dimensions ( see refs .  )",
    "@xmath163 from one obtains @xmath164",
    "in this paper we have at last identified beyond any reasonable doubt the analytical constants which appear in the simplest non - trivial 4-loop @xmath0-@xmath1 master integral .",
    "we have also discovered that the _ same _ constants appear in some 4-dimensional lattice integrals .",
    "clearly we still do not know a rigorous proof of these relations , but , once the form of the results is known , we hope that proofs will be easier to find ( see the very recent papers@xcite ) .",
    "while we were completing this paper , kindly david broadhurst sent us a copy of his new paper@xcite . in that paper ,",
    "several elliptic integral evaluations of bessel moments are performed . in particular , a proof of our and is given , as well as of and .",

    "in addition , several relations between bessel moments are found , and some evaluations of double elliptic integrals are done .",
