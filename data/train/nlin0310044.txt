    "in early september 2001 one of the authors ( uf ) attended the zakopane meeting on tubes , sheets and singularities @xcite which was also attended by richard pelz .",
    "there were many discussions about the issue of finite - time blowup for 3d incompressible euler flow .",
    "richard , who had studied a flow introduced by @xcite , had evidence in favor of blowup but one could not rule out that the highly special structure of this flow would lead to quasi - singular intermediate asymptotics .",
    "the three authors of this paper then decided to embark in a long - term project aimed at getting strong evidence for or against blowup for a wide class of flows encompassing the taylor  green flow @xcite and the kida ",
    "pelz vortex @xcite , namely space - periodic flow with or without symmetry having initially only a few fourier harmonics .",
    "such initial flow is not only analytic but also entire : there is no singularity at finite distance in the whole complex spatial domain .",
    "as has been known since the mathematical work of @xcite , any real finite - time singularity is preceded by complex - space singularities approaching the real domain and which can be detected and traced using fourier methods @xcite .",
    "this method is traditionally carried out by spectral simulations which run out of steam when the distance @xmath1 from the real domain to the nearest complex - space singularity is about two meshes .",
    "we pointed out in a recent paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth referred to as fmb ) , which also reviews the issue of blowup , that it may be possible to extend the method of tracing of complex singularities by performing a holomorphic transformation mapping singularities away from the real domain and , perhaps doing this recursively .",
    "this is the basic idea of the _ spectral adaptive _ method which aims at combining the extreme accuracy of spectral methods with the local mesh refinement permitted by adaptive methods .    in one dimension",
    "the complex - space singularities of pde s are isolated points , at least in the simplest cases , as for the burgers equation . in higher dimension",
    "they are extended objects , such as complex manifolds .",
    "understanding the nature and the geometry of such singularities is a prerequisite for mapping them away .",
    "many aspects can already be investigated in the two - dimensional case for which we know not only that blowup is ruled out , but we also know that the flow stays a lot more regular than predicted by rigorous lower bounds ( basically @xmath1 seems to decrease exponentially whereas the bound is a double exponential in time ) .",
    "in fmb we gave some evidence that in 2d the complex singularities are on a smooth manifold , but the nature of the singularities was not very clear and in particular the issue of finiteness vs. blowup of the complex vorticity was moot .",
    "in fmb we also pointed out that the issue of singularities can be simplified if we limit ourselves to short times .",
    "let us briefly recall the setting .",
    "we start with the 2-d euler equation written in stream function formulation @xmath3 where @xmath4 . as in fmb",
    ", we focus on the two - mode initial condition @xmath5 one of the simplest initial condition having nontrivial eulerian dynamics . the solution @xmath6 , obtained by analytic continuation to complex locations @xmath7 , is expected to have singularities at large imaginary values when @xmath8 is small .",
    "if one focuses on the quadrant @xmath9 and @xmath10 , an asymptotic argument given in fmb suggests looking at solutions satisfying the _ similarity ansatz _",
    "@xmath11 substitution in gives the _ similarity equation _ @xmath12 where the overscript tilde means that the partial derivatives are taken with respect to the new variables .",
    "the initial condition becomes a boundary condition @xmath13 note that has no time variable .",
    "its solution can be shown to be analytic for sufficiently negative @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "if it has singularities in the real or complex domain then , by , the solution of the original euler equation should have short - time singularities at a distance @xmath16 .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in section  [ s : numshort ] we check the logarithmic law for @xmath1 and thus the validity of the similarity ansatz . in section  [ s : solving ] we develop a new technique for solving the similarity equation in both the real and complex domains . in section  [ s : results ] we present numerical results on the nature and the geometry of the singularities . in section  [ s : singular ] we show how to actually construct the singular manifold from the fourier transform of the solution . in section  [ s : conclusion ] we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the standard way of measuring the distance @xmath17 of the nearest complex - space singularity ( also called the width of the analyticity strip ) is to use the method of tracing @xcite .",
    "indeed , the spatial fourier transform @xmath18 of a periodic function @xmath19 has its modulus decreasing at large wavenumbers @xmath20 as @xmath21 in both one and several space dimensions .",
    "more precisely , for each direction @xmath22 , the modulus of the fourier transform decreases as @xmath23 ; the width of the analyticity strip is then the minimum over all directions @xmath24 of @xmath25 which  by a steepest descent argument  also controls the high-@xmath26 decrease of the angle average of the modulus of the fourier transform .",
    "is related to the singular manifold in the two - dimensional case , see section  [ s : singular ] . ]",
    "accurate measurement of the width of the analyticity strip @xmath17 gets difficult when it becomes smaller than a few meshes , so that there is not enough resolution to see long exponential tails @xcite .",
    "a different difficulty appears when @xmath17 is very large and the fourier transform decreases so rapidly that it gets lost in roundoff noise at rather small @xmath26 s . to check on the logarithmic law of variation of @xmath1 at short times for the full time - dependent euler equation",
    ", we have to face the latter difficulty . to overcome it , we employed a 90-digit multiprecision spectral calculation with the number of grid points ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28 the temporal scheme is fourth order runge - kutta .",

    "note that there is a strong odd - even wavenumber oscillation .",
    "this has to do with the interference of two complex singularities separated by @xmath34 in the @xmath33 direction ( a consequence of a symmetry of the initial condition ) .",
    "60 10 short - time spectra ( fig.6 report )    a very clean exponential decrease is observed for even wavenumbers .",

    "this problem can be solved exactly using fourier series @xmath36 note that we have dropped all tildes on the space variables since from now on we will work exclusively with the similarity variables .",
    "obviously , the boundary condition allows the presence only of fourier harmonics with wavevectors in the quadrant @xmath37 .",
    "after is rewritten in terms of the fourier coefficients of @xmath38 , the multiplications appearing in the jacobian go over into simple convolutions with only finitely many terms , because all wavevectors involved must have non - positive components .",
    "it follows that , for integer @xmath39 , all fourier coefficients for wavevectors which are on the line @xmath40 ( see fig .",

    "more precisely , for any point p on this line , the region of dependence is the grey - shaded rectangle .",
    "specifically , we define the selective fourier sum over this line @xmath41 so that @xmath42 from we then obtain the recursion relations @xmath43 with @xmath44 equation can then be rewritten as a set of algebraic equations for the fourier coefficients : @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",

    "even the 35-digit calculation becomes unreliable beyond wavenumber 1300 . in fmb , when we discussed results about singularities without resorting to short - time asymptotics , we reported various difficulties : the need to perform a kind of krasny filtering @xcite and our failure to improve the range of scaling by going to resolutions higher than @xmath62",

    "if we change @xmath140 , this will work as long as the contour does not get pinched between two ( or more ) coalescing singularities ( the pinching , generically , does not take place on the real @xmath144 axis ) .",

    "let us finally observe that the method of analyticity disks can be generalized to problems without any special symmetry ; this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "let us now summarize what we have learned about singularities for the similarity equation governing the short - time asymptotics .",
    "first , we remind the reader that for one - dimensional problems , complex - space singularities can be at isolated points but need not : for nonintegrable ode s they often form fractal natural boundaries @xcite . in two dimensions or higher ,",
    "isolated singularities are ruled out : the singular set is a complex manifold ( or worse ) . in the present case ,",
    "the evidence is that the singularities are on a smooth and probably analytic one - dimensional complex manifold .",
    "this was already conjectured in fmb on the basis of numerical results for the full time - dependent euler equation .",
    "now , we have an explicit construction of the singular manifold by the method of envelope of analyticity disks ( section  [ s : singular ] ) , which gives strong numerical evidence for smoothness .    the very clean scaling we have observed for the fourier transform of the solution near the singularity ( fig .",
    "[ f : ssashifted ] ) implies that the vorticity is infinite on the singular manifold since in 2d the vorticity is conserved along lagrangian fluid trajectories ( both in the real and the complex domain ) , this result strongly suggests that the singular manifold is mapped to complex infinity by the inverse lagrangian map .",
    "we have studied here a special flow , whose two - mode initial condition given by has a center of symmetry at @xmath168 .",
    "such symmetries are hard to avoid when using a minimal number of fourier modes . at short times",
    ", the symmetry constrains the complex - space singularity nearest to the real domain to have the real part of its location at @xmath169 . in fmb",
    "we have shown that this ceases to be the case at later times .",
    "we do of course hope that there is something universal in the nature of the singularities , be it only their very existence .",
    "we must however stress that in the present case we have a singular manifold with a continuous piece and not just isolated points when @xmath170 .",
    "this is definitely non - generic , since a manifold with complex dimension 1 may be viewed as a two - dimensional real manifold in four - dimensional real space .",
    "when higher - order harmonics are added to the initial condition , the situation becomes more complicated and the short - time asymptotic equation will in general depend on the ratio @xmath171 , that is on the direction in which the imaginary coordinates become large .",
    "let us finally point out that one particularly challenging problem is to actually prove that there are singularities in the complex domain : at the moment we are not aware of a single instance of a solution to the incompressible euler equation with smooth initial data for which the existence of a singularity ( real or complex ) is demonstrated . in the present case , the proof may be facilitated by the observation made in section  [ s : results ] that , in the @xmath102-plane the vorticity is real and can be represented as a double power series with ( apparently ) nonnegative coefficients . a lower bound on these coefficient  which are obtained from the solutions of the recurrence relations",

    "<S> using a very high precision spectral calculation applied to the incompressible and inviscid flow with initial condition @xmath0 , we find that the width @xmath1 of its analyticity strip follows a @xmath2 law at short times over eight decades . the asymptotic equation governing the structure of spatial complex - space singularities at short times ( frisch , matsumoto and bec 2003 , j.  stat .  phys . 113 , 761781 ) is solved by a high - precision expansion method . strong numerical evidence is obtained that singularities have infinite vorticity and lie on a complex manifold which is constructed explicitly as an envelope of analyticity disks </S>",
