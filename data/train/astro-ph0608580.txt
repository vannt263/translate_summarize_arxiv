    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) has enjoyed a great deal of success in explaining the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure in general ( spergel et al .",
    "however , its predictions on small scales have not been fully understood or confirmed by observations yet .",
    "this is partly limited by our computing power in resolving the smallest dark matter structures and detailed gas and stellar dynamics in structure formation . nevertheless in a pioneering work diemand , moore & stadel ( 2005 ) were able to resolve a galaxy - size dark halo down to the free - streaming scale .",
    "the smallest structures ( called microhalos ) have a minimum mass ( @xmath1 ) , which were followed in simulations from redshift @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "as much as 0.1 percent of the dark matter in the universe are in these substructures . at later redshift",
    "larger substructures collapse out of perturbations on larger scales , and hierarchical halo formation ( lacey & cole 1994 ) predicts that the microhalos also fall into these larger structures and are expected to survive inside given their high internal density .",
    "extrapolations show the milky way may contain around @xmath4 such microhalos with the nearest one being on the average about 0.1 pc distant from the earth , and with typical size 0.01 pc .",
    "the numerical simulations of diemand et al ( 2005 , 2006 ) also confirm the analytical predictions of berezinsky , dokuchaev & eroshenko ( 2005 ) .",
    "there has been much intrigue over tidal mass - loss from satellite galaxies , for instance the tidal streams of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( e.g. savage , freese & gondolo 2006 ) and the magellanic clouds ( e.g. johnston , spergel & haydn 2002 ) .",
    "however , details of the mass - loss from the smallest scale dark matter halos are still sketchy and although some work has been done to develop semi - analytical models of microhalo destruction ( zhao et al . 2006 ,",
    "berezinski et al .",
    "2005 , green & goodwin 2006 ) , virtually no rigorous modelling using n - body codes has been published .",
    "it has been noted ( green & goodwin 2006 ) that making analyses of disruption rates from seperate consideration of the tides , stellar encounters and disk shocking is insufficient and one consistent approach is needed .",
    "here we performed n - body simulations in a respectable star distribution ( robin , reyle & picaud 2003 ) with microhalos on orbits in a disk type galaxy potential with dark halo , disk and bulge components , adding contributions from star encounters in each time step over the age of the stellar disk .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows ; in  [ sec : incon ] we give an analytical prescription of a typical microhalo using the nfw profile ( navarro et al .",
    "we have two sets of initial conditions for the internal particles of the microhalo .",
    "the first is for randomly inclined circular orbits and the second is with a radially anisotropic dispersion .",
    "then we set up the geometry of single encounters with stars and compare the impulse approximation with numerical simulations using the n - body tree code of vine & sigurdsson ( 1998 ) .    using n - body simulations we calculated , for four typical stellar masses ( 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.6 and 1.0 @xmath5 ) , ( i ) the likely safe impact parameter between stars and microhalos where no mass should be stripped , ( ii ) the critical impact parameter below which the microhalo will be destroyed ( i.e. 95% of particles given escape velocity ) .",
    "( iii ) we show for single encounters the difference between instantaneous bound fraction of microhalo mass and the fraction remaining bound after particle escape is allowed and the potential shallows . finally ( iv ) we present the bound fraction of microhalo mass as a function of impact parameter for a single encounter , comparing the microhalos with radially anisotropic and randomly oriented circular initial conditions .",
    "in  [ sec : realsim ] we present a procedure to use the besanson model ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) of the milky way to simulate the encounters of microhalos with stars on typical orbits in the milky way in a three component ( bulge , disk , halo ) potential over a several gyr orbital timescale until the microhalo is destroyed .",
    "then in  [ sec : res ] we use this model to produce some interesting results .",
    "( i ) that the survival time of microhalos and the averaged stellar density along the orbit can be related by a power law and ( ii ) that the survival time is keenly linked to the orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "( iii ) particles escape via diffusion during disk crossings and ( iv ) the microstreams created from destroyed microhalos remain filamentary for many gyr .",
    "we conclude and discuss our results in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "[ sec : incon ]      according to berezinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and diemand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the likely minimum mass of a microhalo set by free - streaming and collisional damping is of the order of an earth mass , @xmath6 ) and can be distributed as an nfw model with a density @xmath7 where the concentration constant @xmath8 and the virial radius @xmath9 .",

    "r^r_v v_c^2 dr . yields dispersions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigr ] ) and a velocity - radius plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel20 ] ) .",
    "it was noted by kazantzidis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that anisotropy can affect mass loss , stemming from the fact that anisotropic distributions have more particles on radial orbits that extend beyond the virial radius even though they are bound .",
    "our two distributions ( ta and ra microhalos ) are unlikely to be typical for microhalos , however , they should _ bracket _ the two extreme regimes of anisotropy , thus gleaning us a lot of insight .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig : streams ]      many authors have noted the higher survival probabilities of microhalos depending on certain orbital parameters .",
    "pericentre , apocentre , orbital energy , magnitude and sign of orbital angular momentum and even internal anisotropy as we have considered .",
    "our simulations all begin at the galactic position ( r , z)=(8kpc,0 ) .",
    "the energy of an orbit is defined in the following way    e=1 2(v_r^2 + v_^2 + v_z^2 ) + ( r,0 ) = 1 2(v_r^2 + j^2 r^2 ) + ( r,0 ) . where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the orbital velocities of cylindrical co - ordinates where negative @xmath19 is directed towards the centre of the galaxy , @xmath20 is tangential and @xmath18 is perpendicular to the disk .",
    "@xmath21 is the galactic potential at radius r in the disk . the total angular momentum @xmath22 ( approximate integral of motion ) and its z - component ( conserved ) of the orbit is defined as j = r , j_z = rv_z .",
    "for the ra microhalos we have plotted initial orbital @xmath23 vs. v in fig.[fig : vzv ] for the 29 microhalos using four different symbols depending on their individual survival times .",
    "this hints at the different regions of phase space which are likely to have surviving microhalos . in figs.[fig : ej ] and [ fig : ejz ] we plot the orbital angular momentum j and @xmath24 against energy e for the ra microhalos .",
    "the unphysical regions of the plots simply show that for a certain @xmath25 or energy at a specific distance a microhalo is limited in its maximum @xmath18 , j or @xmath24 .",
    "there is a clear trend for the microhalos on high energy and angular momentum orbits to survive longer . written another way , microhalos on planar and radial orbits",
    "will be rapidly destroyed , whereas increasing tangential velocities will enable them to survive intact for greater timescales .      if it is the case that survival depends on orbital properties we can begin to think about the microstreams created by the destruction of microhalos .",
    "we show in fig.[fig : streams ] the sample microhalo at multiple stages of its evolution .",
    "clearly , the microhalo becomes increasingly filamentary , but even after over 5gyr , the stream is still a distinct entity that would stand out in the presence of a background thanks to the low escape speeds .    from the discussion of orbital parameters and the microstreams there are clearly many implications for the direct detection signal from dedicated dark matter searches because depending on the velocity of microhalos , especially perpendicular to the galactic plane and opposing the rotation of the disk , they will have various degrees of concentration",
    ". additionally , it may be the case that most microhalos passing near the earth have been dispersed into streams and our detector would have a boosted probability of actually passing through a stream or a superposition of many streams .",
    "[ sec : conc ] microhalos of @xmath26 are likely the first substructures formed in a cdm universe .",
    "those microhalos in dense regions of galaxies would experience strong tidal stripping .",
    "here we presented n - body simulations of microhalos in single encounters with stars as well as in a series of encounters in a realistic milky way .",
    "the clear trend is that for orbits close to the solar neighbourhood the survival time falls off as a power law of the average stellar density and the only likely surviving microhalos are ones on orbits with high energy and angular momentum ; also the ta microhalos have a slightly better chance of survival than the ra microhalos . +   + nevertheless , some cautionary points : +   + 1 .",
    "we consider only sun - passing orbits .",
    "those closer to the bulge are likely more severely stripped and more distant ones are less interesting for detection .",
    "our microhalos all have the same total mass of @xmath26 and fixed initial tidal radius ( 0.01pc ) . in realisty slightly more massive microhalos may endure stellar encounters to greater effect and exist in higher numbers today . also the initial tidal radius should vary with the pericenter of the microhalo .",
    "+ 3 . the stars in our galaxy",
    "are not formed all at exactly 4 gyrs ago .",
    "the granularity and the flattening of the galactic potential presumably increased gradually over a hubble time .",
    "however , our method shows how the impulsive encounters with stars alongside disk shocking and tidal stripping poses a serious threat to the survival of primordial microhalos .",
    "the statistical nature of survival that we have demonstrated could be used or at least elaborated upon to predict statistically the phase space distributions of microhalos and morphology in order to make more accurate estimates of annihilation and direct detection signals .",
