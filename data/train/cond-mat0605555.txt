    "the compound , bairo@xmath0 has drawn significant attention in the recent time due to the observation of charge density wave ( cdw ) transition despite insulating transport observed above and below the cdw transition temperature ( @xmath3  185  k).@xcite interestingly , it also exhibits a ferromagnetic transition at the same temperature ( 185  k ) where cdw ground state sets in .",
    "the saturation magnetic moment in the ferromagnetic phase , however , is found to be very small ( @xmath40.03  @xmath5 ) compared to that expected from the @xmath6 electronic configuration corresponding to ir@xmath7 .",
    "= 4.0 in    the crystal structure of bairo@xmath0 is monoclinic ( space group b2/m ; unique axis @xmath8 ) . in this structure , iro@xmath9 octahedra form ir@xmath0o@xmath10 trimers by face sharing as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the ir@xmath0o@xmath10 trimers are inter - linked by corner - sharing to form columns parallel to @xmath11-axis .",
    "the axis of the connecting trimers are marginally tilted ( @xmath412@xmath12 ) as shown in the figure.@xcite this leads to the monoclinic structure with the crystallographic angle , @xmath13 = 103.27@xmath12 .",
    "this typical structure makes it a quasi - one dimensional system as has clearly been manifested in the anisotropic transport , magnetic and optical properties.@xcite the structure becomes more complex due to the twisting and buckling of the trimers resulting in the multiplicity of ir - o and ba - o bond distances , thereby creating 4 types of ir and 3 types of ba sites.@xcite different non - equivalent ir atoms are represented by ir1 , ir2 , ir3 and ir4 in the figure .",
    "interestingly , each trimer consists of two non - equivalent ir atoms .",
    "for example , if ir2 forms the central octahedron of a trimer , it is connected by face sharing to the other two octahedra formed by ir1 .",
    "similarly , the neighboring ir@xmath0o@xmath10 trimer is formed by ir3 and ir4 , where ir4 forms the central octahedron and ir3 forms the other two octahedra .",
    "thus , the inter - trimer link is established along @xmath11 direction via ( ir1)-o-(ir3 ) connectivity .    despite very short intra - trimer ir - ir distances compared to ir - metal and ir - o - ir angle close to 180@xmath12 for inter - trimer connections , bairo@xmath0 exhibits insulating transport behavior .",
    "in addition , there are multiple metal - insulator ( mi ) transitions within the cdw ground state .",
    "while the occurrence of cdw transitions in the insulating phase is surprising , a recent high - resolution photoemission study@xcite reveals the signature of finite density of states at the fermi level , @xmath14 , at room temperature and it was shown that the cdw ground state evolves by opening a soft gap at @xmath14 across cdw transition temperature .",
    "interestingly , the intensity at @xmath14 in the photoemission spectra at room temperature ( @xmath15 ) is significantly small consistent with the observation of very small electronic specific heat coefficient@xcite ( @xmath4  1  mj / mole.k@xmath16 ) .",
    "in contrast , previous theoretical study using extended hckel tight - binding electronic band structure calculations@xcite exhibits large intensity at @xmath14 as expected for a @xmath6 electronic configuration corresponding to ir@xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the core level spectra in the photoemission measurements@xcite predicts the existence of two different kinds of ba sites at room temperature , which become similar before the onset of cdw ground state .",
    "all these anomalies@xcite in the transport , magnetic and spectroscopic data reveal that bairo@xmath0 is truly an exotic material .    since",
    ", the 5@xmath1 orbitals in 5@xmath1 transition metal oxides are highly extended compared to that in 3@xmath1 or 4@xmath1 systems , it is expected that the electron correlation strength will be significantly weak and that the _ ab initio _ approaches will be successful to describe the electronic properties in this system . in this study , we therefore , investigate the electronic structure of bairo@xmath0 using _ state - of - the - art ab initio _ approaches .",
    "the calculations for various magnetic configurations suggest that the ground state of bairo@xmath0 is ferromagnetic exhibiting small magnetic moments consistent with the experimental observations.@xcite the analysis of the valence band density of states in comparison with the experimental photoemission results@xcite suggests that the small intensity at @xmath14 in the photoemission spectra and the insulating transport behavior are presumably related to the pinning of @xmath14 at the upper edge of @xmath17 band due to the intrinsic non - stoichiometry of the samples@xcite and these edge states are localized due to disorder / crystallographic distortions.@xcite the calculations for the ba 4@xmath2 core levels exhibit signature of two non - equivalent ba sites with respect to the madelung potential at the ba sites in the crystal structure at room temperature .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations were carried out using full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method ( wien2k software@xcite ) within the local spin density approximations ( lsda ) .",
    "the crystal structure considered for these calculations has b2/m space group with the @xmath8-axis as the unique axis .",
    "the lattice parameters ( @xmath11 = 10.005  , @xmath18 = 15.174  , @xmath8 = 5.571  , @xmath19 = @xmath20 = 90@xmath12 and @xmath13 = 103.27@xmath12 ) and the atomic positions used for all the calculations correspond to the room temperature structure reported for well characterized polycrystalline and single crystalline samples in references [ 1,3 ] .",
    "it is to note here that most of these studies for the crystal structure analysis report the space group as c2/m with @xmath18 axis as the unique axis , which has been transformed to b2/m space group by coordinate transformations ( @xmath21 ) in order to satisfy the requirement of the wien2k software .",
    "the muffin - tin radii ( @xmath22 ) for ba , ir and o were set to 1.217  , 1.111   and 0.847  , respectively .",
    "the convergence for different calculations were achieved considering 512 @xmath23 points within the brillouin zone .",
    "the error bar for the energy convergence was set to @xmath24  1  mev .",
    "in fig .  2 , we show the density of states calculated for the non - magnetic ground state using the lattice parameters corresponding to room temperature structure as mentioned in the previous section . the total density of states ( tdos ) , ir 5@xmath1 partial density of states ( pdos ) , o 2@xmath2 pdos and ba 5@xmath1 pdos are plotted in fig .",
    "2(a ) , 2(b ) , 2(c ) and 2(d ) , respectively .",
    "ba 5@xmath1 electronic states contribute in the energy range 4  ev above the fermi level as shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) with almost no contribution at lower energies . o 2@xmath2 contribution in the ba 5@xmath1 dominated energy region is very little , which is expected for the 5@xmath1 energy level in this heavy alkaline earth atom compared to the cases observed for lighter alkaline earth atoms such as sr in sr - compounds or ca in ca - compounds having unoccupied 4@xmath1 and 3@xmath1 levels , respectively.@xcite this suggests that the role of ba - o covalency in the electronic / crystal structure is not significant in this system .",
    "= 4.5 in    there are three groups of features observed in tdos in the occupied part of the electronic structure shown below @xmath14 (=  0  ev ) . the energy range between -5.5  ev to -2.3  ev is primarily dominated by the o 2@xmath2 pdos with negligible contributions from ir 5@xmath1 pdos .",
    "this suggests that the electronic states in this energy range are not bonded with the ir 5@xmath1 states and are known as non - bonding o 2@xmath2 states . in the energies below -5.5  ev ( -5.5  ev@xmath25 - 8.5  ev )",
    ", o 2@xmath2 states have the largest intensity with finite contributions from ir 5@xmath1 electronic states .",
    "thus , these features can be assigned as bonding bands having primarily o 2@xmath2 character .",
    "the anti - bonding bands having @xmath17 symmetry appears in the energy range -2.5  ev to + 0.5  ev ( total width @xmath4  3  ev ) .",
    "the @xmath26 band appears above the fermi level with a minimum excitation gap of about 1.2  ev from the upper edge of @xmath17 band .",
    "the dos in these regions are essentially contributed by the ir 5@xmath1 electronic states with minimal contributions from o 2@xmath2 states .",
    "thus , the electronic states at and around @xmath14 have primarily ir 5@xmath1 character , which naturally determines the transport , magnetic and other thermodynamic properties .",
    "interestingly , dos at @xmath14 is found to be significantly large as also observed before@xcite suggesting highly metallic behavior of the system in contrast to the insulating transport , small specific heat coefficient observed@xcite and the high - resolution photoemission results recently published.@xcite    in order to investigate the contribution from various non - equivalent ir sites separaterly , we plot the @xmath17 and @xmath26 band in fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , respectively . the total @xmath17 bandwidth for each of the ir atoms",
    "is found to be close to 3  ev spanning the same energy region .",
    "the pdos corresponding to ir2 and ir4 are almost uniformly distributed over the whole energy range .",
    "however , ir1 and ir3 exhibit largest intensity close to the fermi level suggesting largest contribution to the conduction electrons .",
    "such a scenario is expected since inter ir@xmath0o@xmath10 trimer connectivity is established via ( ir1)-o-(ir3 ) superexchange interaction as shown in fig .  1 and has largest extended character . ir2 and ir4",
    "provide intra - trimer connectivity via @xmath27 interactions with ir1 and ir3 , respectively .",
    "thus , there is a relative shift between the center of gravity of ir1 , ir3 contributions and ir2 , ir4 contributions .",
    "the features in the energy range @xmath28  -0.75  ev has largest contribution from ir2 and ir4 sites and for @xmath29  -0.75  ev , the intensity arises primarily from ir1 and ir3 contributions .",
    "= 5.0 in    the effective width of the @xmath26 bands is significantly narrower in this system as shown in fig .",
    "while ir2 and ir4 are primarily contributing in the energies 2.5  ev - 3.5  ev above @xmath14 , the ir1 and ir3 contributions appear below 2.5  ev .",
    "interestingly , ir1 and ir3 are found to be very similar in both the energy regions , and ir2 and ir4 have similar dos distributions .    since the axis of any of the iro@xmath9 octahedra are not aligned along any of the crystal axis as shown in fig .  1",
    ", the @xmath17 bands will have contributions from all the @xmath1-orbital states ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) defined in the axis system shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the projected partial density of states corresponding to these orbital are shown separately for each of the ir sites in fig .",
    "interestingly , the primary contribution ( @xmath4  35.77% ) at @xmath14 comes from @xmath32 electronic states located at ir1 and ir3 sites . @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath34 at ir1 and ir3 sites also exhibit large contributions ( 14.3% and 16.6% respectively ) at @xmath14 .",
    "the largest contributions from ir2 and ir4 , however , arise from @xmath32 ( 8.4% ) and @xmath33 ( 7.6% ) electronic states .",
    "these numbers clearly manifest that the electronic states containing the quasi - one dimensional axis of the crystal structure ( @xmath35-axis ) have largest contribution at @xmath14 and hence clearly manifests the signature of large anisotropy observed in various bulk properties.@xcite    = 5.0 in    we now turn to the understanding of the magnetic behavior of bairo@xmath0 .",
    "we carried out the spin - polarized calculations using the same crystal structure as in the case of non - magnetic calculations and use local spin density approximations .",
    "the magnetic moment has been defined by the difference in occupancy of the majority ( up ) and minority ( down ) spin states .",
    "spin - orbit interaction was not considered in these calculations .",
    "interestingly , the calculations for various magnetic configurations reveal that the ferromagnetic ground state is 3.25  mev lower than ( error bar used for convergence is @xmath24  1  mev ) the total energy found for the non - magnetic ground state .",
    "this energy difference is about 20% of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 = 185  k ) .",
    "this calculation , thus , once again establish that lsda approximations are quite accurate in capturing the magnetic ground state of various transition metal oxides as has also been observed in 3@xmath1 transition metal oxides@xcite despite the fact that the electron correlation effects are underestimated in these calculations . the total spin magnetic moment is found to be about 1.34@xmath3810@xmath39  @xmath5 .",
    "this is significantly small compared to that expected for @xmath6 electronic configuration for ir@xmath7 .",
    "such a small value of the spin moment appears presumably due to the highly extended nature of the 5@xmath1 orbitals leading to large kinetic energy of the associated electrons .",
    "the calculated spin moment is consistent with the experimental observation of small saturation magnetic moment ( @xmath4  0.03  @xmath5 ) in the magnetic measurements of single crystalline bairo@xmath0 ; this moment could be measured only after applying a magnetization field as high as 20  t.@xcite no magnetic contribution is found from the ba - related bands , as all these bands are either completely occupied and appear much below @xmath14 or completely unoccupied appearing far above @xmath14 .",
    "the contribution from o 2@xmath2 states is of the order of 10@xmath40 .",
    "the primary contribution to the total magnetic moment arises from the spin polarization of ir 5@xmath1 partial density of states .",
    "interestingly , all the ir atoms are found to order ferromagnetically and the magnetic moment at the central ir site of the ir@xmath0o@xmath10 trimer is almost the half of that observed at the other ir sites .",
    "= 4.5 in    in fig .  5",
    ", we show the spin - polarized ir 5@xmath1 partial density of states for the ferromagnetic ground state , where 5(a ) , 5(b ) , 5(c ) and 5(d ) show the results corresponding to ir1 , ir2 , ir3 and ir4 respectively .",
    "the down - spin contributions are shown by inverting the @xmath41-axis in the same figure with same energy scale for up - spin contributions shown along @xmath35-axis .",
    "no signature of exchange splitting is observed at any of the ir sites .",
    "the up- and down - spin dos reveal almost identical structures in all the cases . in order to investigate the origin of the spin moment",
    ", we show the total ir 5@xmath1 pdos for both up- and down - spin states in fig .",
    "6(a ) and the difference between up- and down - spin contributions in fig .",
    "it is clear that the observed magnetic moment appears due to small asymmetry of the up- and down - spin density of states as a function of energy .",
    "thus , the occupancy of the up- and down - spin contributions is different leading to a small spin - moment .",
    "now , we compare the calculated results with the experimental photoemission spectra published recently for bairo@xmath0.@xcite in fig .",
    "7(a ) , we show the ir 5@xmath1 band obtained from he  ii spectra@xcite and overlap with the calculated @xmath17 band of ir 5@xmath1 pdos . while the calculated results exhibit large intensity at the fermi level suggesting highly metallic behavior of the system , the experimental ir 5@xmath1 feature at room temperature exhibit only very small intensity .",
    "the total width of the occupied part in the calculated pdos is also substantially smaller compared to the ir 5@xmath1 signal in the experimental spectra .",
    "such observations of significant reduction of spectral weight at the fermi level and the population of the higher binding energy region often attributed to the underestimation of electron - electron coulomb repulsion effect in the _ ab initio _ approaches",
    ". however , such a strong correlation effect in these highly extended 5@xmath1 electrons is unexpected .",
    "= 4.5 in    it is to note here that the difference between experimental bulk spectral functions and the _ ab initio _ results could well be explained in the 4@xmath1 transition metal oxides@xcite using perturbative approach to introduce the correlation effect in the self energy of the system .",
    "the effective correlation strength , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 = electron - electron coulomb repulsion strength , @xmath44 = bandwidth ) was found to be small ( @xmath45  0.2 ) in these systems .",
    "we thus calculate the spectral function for bairo@xmath0 in the same way , using the second order perturbation method employed by treglia _",
    "et al._@xcite in this method , the spectral function can be expressed as , @xmath46 where , @xmath47 is the retarded green s function representing the many electron system and is given by @xmath48 where , @xmath49 is the self energy of the system . for small @xmath43 , @xmath49 can be calculated using perturbation approach upto the second order term@xcite within the local approximations .",
    "we have used ir @xmath17 pdos shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) as the band dos for these calculations .",
    "the calculated spectral functions for different @xmath42 are shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) and the calculated self energy is shown in the inset of the same figure .",
    "the increase in @xmath42 leads to a significant spectral weight transfer to higher energies .",
    "the new features appearing at higher binding energies due to such spectral weight transfer is known as incoherent feature and represent the electronic states essentially localized due to such correlation effect .",
    "the feature at the fermi level represent the delocalized states and is known as coherent feature . the total weight of the coherent feature diminishes gradually with the increase in @xmath42 .",
    "however , the intensity at the fermi level remains almost the same for @xmath42 as large as 1.0 .",
    "the spectral function obtained in this process could not generate the spectral lineshape observed in the experimental spectrum for any value of @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests that this procedure may not be adequate to determine the experimental results .",
    "interestingly , a rigid shift of the calculated @xmath17 band by 0.5  ev towards higher binding energies provide a significantly good description of the experimental spectrum . the width and spectral distribution in the shifted spectral function shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) is remarkably similar to that observed in the ir 5@xmath1 band in the he  ii spectrum . in order to investigate this",
    "further we compare the o 2@xmath2 pdos with the experimental spectra as it is well known that the _ ab initio _ calculations are quite successful to provide a good description of the o 2@xmath2 band even in 3@xmath1 transition metal oxides.@xcite we show the experimental al  @xmath50 and he  i spectra in fig .  8",
    "adopted from ref .",
    "the changes in these experimental spectra in the energy range between 3  ev to 9  ev binding energies concomitant to the change in relative photoemission cross section@xcite of the o 2@xmath2 and ir 5@xmath1 electronic states suggest that the features in 3 - 6  ev binding energies appear primarily due to the excitations of o 2@xmath2 non - bonding states and the intensity at higher binding energies are due to the bonding electronic states having large o 2@xmath2 character .",
    "interestingly , the calculated o 2@xmath2 pdos shows the intense non - bonding o 2@xmath2 features around 2.3 - 5.5  ev binding energies with the peak at 2.8  ev binding energy ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , where the dip appears in the he  i spectrum .",
    "this clearly suggests that it is necessary to shift the o 2@xmath2 pdos by at least 0.5  ev towards higher binding energies to compare with the experimental spectra .",
    "the shifted o 2@xmath2 pdos shown by solid line in fig .",
    "8 provide a good description of the experimental results .",
    "= 4.5 in    thus , the results in fig .  7 and fig .",
    "8 suggest that the fermi level is shifted to the upper edge of the @xmath17 band presumably due to the electron doping into the system .",
    "such a shift would stabilize the system due to the closeness to the fully filled electronic configuration resulting to lowering in energy .",
    "interestingly , various experimental results indeed indicate that the oxygen content is often found to be less than 3.0,@xcite which effectively leads to electron doping into the ir 5@xmath1 band .",
    "in addition , the transport measurements always exhibit insulating temperature dependence.@xcite such a behavior is not unusual since it is natural that the small intensity at the upper edge of the @xmath17 band will be localized due to the disorder and/or crystallographic distortions@xcite in this quasi - one dimensional structure leading to an insulating nature .",
    "all these observations , thus , clearly indicate that the electron correlation may not be the primary origin for the differences between experimental and theoretical results .",
    "the electron doping due to the oxygen non - stoichiometry intrinsic to bairo@xmath0 possibly plays the key role in determining the electronic structure and subsequently various physical properties in this system .",
    "= 4.4 in    we now turn to the question of multiple ba core level signals in the experimental spectra.@xcite we show the dos corresponding to ba 5@xmath2 core levels in fig .",
    "there are three non - equivalent ba sites in the structure with respect to the ba - o bond length and the symmetries .",
    "it is clear that the dos corresponding to ba1 and ba2 appear in the same energy range .",
    "while the width of the dos corresponding to ba2 5@xmath2 states is similar to those corresponding to ba1 and ba3 , the peak position appear at higher binding energies .",
    "the energy difference between these spectral features is about 0.25  ev .",
    "this observation clearly suggests that the madelung potential at all the ba sites are not same and is consistent with the experimental observation of two non - equivalent features corresponding to each ba core level photoemissions . such relative shift of the dos corresponding to different non - equivalent ir atoms",
    "is not observed in these calculations ( e.g. see fig .  3 for the @xmath17 bands corresponding to 4 non - equivalent ir sites ) .",
    "in summary , we investigate the detailed electronic structure of bairo@xmath0 in this study using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the local spin density approximations .",
    "the calculations for various magnetic configurations reveal lowest energy for the ferromagnetic ground state and is consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "the ferromagnetic ground state energy calculated using room temperature crystal structure is found to be 3.25  mev lower than the non - magnetic ground state .",
    "no exchange splitting is observed in any of the electronic states involved in forming the valence band .",
    "the small magnetic moment appears due to unequal population of the different ir 5@xmath1 spin density of states .",
    "comparison with the photoemission spectra suggests that electron- electron coulomb repulsion may not be the key factor in determining the electronic structure as expected for the highly extended nature of the 5@xmath1 electronic states .",
    "the discrepancy between the experimental spectra and the calculated results appears to arise primarily from the intrinsic non - stoichiometry of bairo@xmath0 leading to electron doping into the @xmath17 band .",
