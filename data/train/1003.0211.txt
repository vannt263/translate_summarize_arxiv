    "being one of the main sources of information on strangeness  changing baryon interactions , the non  mesonic weak decay of @xmath1hypernuclei has attracted a great deal of attention for several years . in this decay , the final , observable product is the emission of two or more nucleons from the hypernucleus .",
    "the non  mesonic decay width , @xmath8 , is built up from the one and two  nucleon induced decays , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively : @xmath11 .",
    "all possible isospin components are : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "one should note that the only observables in hypernuclear weak decay are the lifetime @xmath17 , the mesonic rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the spectra of the emitted particles ( nucleons , pions and photons ) . none of the non  mesonic partial decay rates ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc ) is an observable from a quantum  mechanical point of view .",
    "each one of the possible elementary non  mesonic decays occurs in the nuclear environment , thus subsequent final state interactions ( fsi ) modify the quantum numbers of the weak decay nucleons and new , secondary nucleons are emitted as well : this prevents the measurement of any of the non  mesonic partial decay rates .    among the weak decay observables one has the spectra of emitted neutrons ( @xmath23 ) and protons ( @xmath24 ) as well as the @xmath25 and @xmath26 nucleon coincidence spectra , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the present contribution",
    "we discuss a microscopic model to take care of the @xmath0 ratio and of the single ",
    "nucleon spectra for the emission of protons and neutrons .",
    "we report results for @xmath2c .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ form ] we outline the formalism , results for @xmath2c are discussed in section  [ results ] and finally , in section  [ conclu ] , some conclusions are given .",
    "using the formalism developed in  @xcite , the number of particles , @xmath29 , and of pair of particles , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 or @xmath32 , emitted in non  mesonic decay can be written as follows : @xmath33 all terms which contain the functions @xmath34 represent the action of fsi .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a complete explanation of the meaning of these functions .",
    "the factors @xmath35 are the numbers of nucleons of the type @xmath36 contained in the multinucleon state @xmath37 . in the same way ,",
    "the @xmath38 s are the numbers of @xmath39 nucleon pairs in the state @xmath37 .",
    "the summation over @xmath40 and @xmath37 runs over all possible initial ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and final ( @xmath37 ) states .",
    "we have used a normalization for which @xmath43 .",
    "the five quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 of eqs .",
    "( [ nn1f])([npp1f ] ) are observables .",
    "five decay widths , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , also enter into these equations . the fact that fsi can not be neglected makes it impossible to invert the above relations in order to obtain expressions for the decay widths in terms of the observables @xmath29 and @xmath30 . by starting from the experimental values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 it is possible to extract the",
    "so  called experimental values for the decay widths , once a model for the fsi is implemented .",
    "this is done in the hope that several models for fsi will lead to the same values for the extracted decay widths .    in this contribution",
    "we adopt a different working method . instead of extracting experimental values for the decay widths , we work out a microscopic model to report results for @xmath29 and @xmath30 given by eqs .",
    "( [ nn1f])([npp1f ] ) .",
    "fsi are modeled by the set of feynman diagrams of fig .",
    "it should be noted that by considering all the possible time ",
    "orderings of these diagrams , some of the corresponding goldstone diagrams are pure gsc contributions ( to @xmath46 ) , others are pure fsi terms and others are interferences between gsc and fsi contributions .",
    "pauli exchange terms have not been evaluated .     and",
    "@xmath47 , respectively . ]",
    "here we report results on the coincidence number ratio , @xmath0 , and on the single  proton and single ",
    "neutron emission spectra , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as a function of the nucleon kinetic energy .",
    "the calculation is performed in nuclear matter ; by the local density approximation we obtain results for @xmath2c .",
    "the weak transition potential , @xmath48 , is represented by the exchange of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 mesons , with the coupling constants and cut  off parameters deduced from the nijmegen soft  core interaction nsc97f  @xcite . for the residual strong interaction , @xmath55",
    ", we use a @xmath56 potential with the addition of a @xmath57 landau  migdal parameter , with @xmath58 .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we present our results for the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "the inclusion of fsi brings to a good agreement with data ( without fsi , one would have @xmath59 ) .",
    "conversely , the effect of the quantum interference terms ( which correspond to the diagrams @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is not important in the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "however , from table  [ table2 ] we see that the individual values of the interference terms are sizable in comparison with the dominant ones ( @xmath64 ) in both @xmath27 and @xmath28 . from table",
    "[ table2 ] we also see that the reduction due to the energy and angular cuts suffered by the fsi terms is much bigger than the reduction for the fsi  free , 1n  ind term .",
    "this is expected , as fsi give a dominant contribution in the low  energy region .",
    "the single ",
    "nucleon spectra obtained with the microscopic model are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that an improvement has been obtained with respect to the fsi  free predictions .",
    "we observe that it is the action of the residual strong interaction ( through fsi and gsc ) the mechanism which could lead , once additional many ",
    "body terms are considered , to an agreement with the experimental spectra .    ) and single  neutron ( @xmath23 ) kinetic energy spectra for @xmath65 . with continuous ( dashed ) lines",
    "we give our results with ( without ) fsi .",
    "data are from kek  e508  @xcite . ]",
    "from the experimental spectra of nucleons produced in hypernuclear non  mesonic weak decay it is not straightforward to determine the decay widths @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath22 , etc : a theoretical model for fsi is required . in this contribution , a quantum  mechanical microscopic model for nucleon emission has been discussed .",
    "it has been shown that with this approach it is possible to obtain a rather good agreement with experiment for the @xmath0 ratio . however , we note that one should also reproduce the individual spectra @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , etc .    from a comparison with data ,",
    "the predictions of our microscopic model for fsi shows a clear improvement over the fsi  free results .",
    "our results suggest that the interference terms are not important .",
    "the present approach requires further improvements : @xmath68 a more realistic residual strong interaction , @xmath69 the inclusion of pauli exchange terms for the fsi diagrams and @xmath70 the study of the effect of the @xmath71 .",
    "finally , we note that the microscopic model allows us to set constraints not only on @xmath48 but also on @xmath47 .",
