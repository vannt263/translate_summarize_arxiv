    "in the last forty years , dark matter ( hereafter dm ) has been one of the more challenging topics in astronomy . after the first pioneering studies ( zwicky 1933 and smith 1936 ) , convincing evidence for the existence of dm came from the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( freeman 1970 , einasto 1974 , rubin & ford 1970 , rubin et al .",
    "1978 , 1980 , 1982 , 1985 ) .",
    "its presence has been also supported by recent indirected measurements of its density , obtained by surveys such as sdss ( tegmark et al .",
    "2006 ) , or by satellites like wmap ( komatsu et al .",
    "2009 , larson et al .",
    "despite all this evidence , the nature of dm is still unknown .",
    "the most widely accepted idea is that it consists of non - relativistic , weakly interacting , non - baryonic particles ( cowsik & mcclelland 1973 ; szalay & marx 1976 ) , emitting no ( or very little ) electromagnetic radiation .",
    "numerical simulations provide a reliable method of calculating the dm distribution on large scales , making robust predictions for its clustering .",
    "the resolution of the first simulations ( peebles 1982 , frenk et al .",
    "1985 ) was not sufficient to resolve the inner parts of the dm halos , but the gap has started to be filled in the last decade , with n - body simulations able to provide results for halos of the size of the largest galaxy clusters ( springel et al .",
    "2005 , boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "more recently simulations such as via lactea ii ( diemand et al . 2008 ) , ghalo ( stadel et al . 2009 ) and aquarius ( springel et al . 2008 ) were able to reproduce the formation and the structure of a milky way - like dm halo down to a resolution of about 100 pc .",
    "particle physics provides us with various well - motivated dark matter candidates , including weakly interacting massive particles ( hereafter wimps ) .",
    "they interact with ordinary matter through elastic scattering on atomic nuclei ( goodman & witten 1985 ) , and many experiments are currently underway aiming to detect this phenomenon , such as cdms ii ( ahmed et al .",
    "2010 ) , xenon100 ( aprile et al . 2010 ) and zeplin iii ( akimov et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the goal of these experiments is to measure the number of recoil events per unit energy and , in some case , its temporal or angular dependence .",
    "these quantities depend on the local dm density and speed distribution of the incident particles in the detector rest frame ( jungman et al .",
    "1996 , lewin & smith 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the possible presence of a significant amount of fine - grained structure in the dm distribution in the solar neighbourhood , such as overdensities and streams , would have important consequences for these direct detection experiments . + the establishment of a reliable model for the milky way still represents a significant source of uncertainty .",
    "one of the main reasons is that the scale relevant for direct detection experiments ( @xmath1 ) is well beyond the resolution of current simulations .",
    "furthermore , dm particles are `` cold '' , allowing the formation of micro - halos with masses down to @xmath2 ( green et al .",
    "unfortunately , such micro - halos are far smaller than the smallest subhalos resolvable by simulations , which have mass @xmath3 and size @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , other approaches are required to resolve the ultra - small scales probed by direct detection experiments .",
    "+ stiff and widrow ( hereafter sw ) calculated the dm ultra - local velocity distribution @xmath5 at a single spatial point of phase - space , identified as an ideal terrestrial detector ( stiff & widrow 2003 ) .",
    "this result was achieved using a reverse technique that allowed them to reach a resolution that can not be obtained by n - body simulations .",
    "they found that @xmath5 is characterised by the presence of a small number of discrete streams of particles .",
    "unfortunately , the reverse integration is unstable , requiring the introduction of a softening length of @xmath6 into the adopted gravitational force law .",
    "this softening is large enough to affect the dm phase - space distribution imprinting on a terrestrial detector .",
    "+ other theoretical investigations have argued that the ultra - local wimp distribution consists of a much larger number of streams , of the order of @xmath7 ( helmi et al .",
    "2002 ; vogelsberger et al .",
    "overlapping dm streams in the inner part of the halo lead to more complex configurations , which may ultimately be indistinguishable from a smooth distribution .",
    "moreover , direct cosmological simulations show that the most massive local streams only contribute about 1 percent of the local dm density ( diemand et al .",
    "2008 , vogelsberger et al .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that at earth s location the dm ultra - fine distribution is composed of over @xmath8 streams , which are generated by the tidal disruption of dm `` cold '' microhalos ( schneider et al . 2010 ) .",
    "they conclude that the material these streams are composed of is not dense enough to be relevant for detection experiments .",
    "+ recently vogelsberger and white ( 2011 ; hereafter vw ) have argued that the picture on ultra - local scales is not too different from that suggested by n - body simulations . using a new technique for calculating the phase - space distribution function in the neighbourhood of a simulation particle ( vogelsberger et al .",
    "2008 ) , they estimate the presence of about @xmath9 unresolved streams at the solar position .",
    "their conclusion is that the local velocity distribution is smooth ( vogelsberger & white 2011 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new method of simulating the dm distribution of the milky way , building on the approach developed by fantin et al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "applied to a merger tree describing the history of a milky way - like galaxy , the model attributes to each progenitor of the halo a characteristic dm distribution , using the method developed in paper i. the final result , obtained by summing the contributions of all the progenitors , provides a model of the ultra - fine dm distribution in the solar neighbourhood at arbitrarily high spatial resolution , obtained without the computational overhead of a complete numerical integration .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the technique to calculate the ultra - fine dm distribution of a merger tree .",
    "section 3 contains our results , section 4 draws some conclusions , and section 5 provides a summary .",
    "in paper i we modelled the interaction between an unbound system of particles and a milky way - like galaxy .",
    "although not intended as a quantitative description of the milky way , this approach makes possible a detailed exploration of phase - space , and a thorough analysis of the expected signature of a series of merger events in a terrestrial dm detector .",
    "the method has the great benefit of being analytically soluble , allowing the calculation of the dynamics of the merger remarkably simply .",
    "furthermore , the gravitational force does not have to be artificially softened , providing a significant improvement in accuracy . to describe the milky way gravitational well we adopt the isochrone potential . despite not being a realistic representation of a complex system such as the milky way , for example causing an overestimation of the granularity of the system at the present time , the qualitative properties of the potential are similar to those of our galaxy .",
    "fig [ fig : rot_curve_isoc ] presents the rotation curve calculated with a scale length equal to the solar radius .",
    "both the value of the circular speed at the solar radius and the overall shape of the rotation curve are in reasonable agreement with the milky way rotation curve shown in fig . 1 and 5 of sofue et al .",
    "( 2009 )        concerning the merging halo , we model its initial dm phase - space distribution by assuming a bivariate gaussian , @xmath10 } \\ ;   e^{-[({\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v_{sat}})^2}/{2\\sigma_{\\rm{v}}^{2 } } ] } \\ , \\ ] ] where ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) is the initial location of the merging halo in phase - space , which allows us to simply parametrise its main properties , where @xmath13 models its initial spatial extent and @xmath14 its velocity dispersion .",
    "galaxy formation models ( kauffmann et al . 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ) and n - body simulations ( springel et al .",
    "2005 , boylan - kolchin et al",
    ". 2009 ) both suggest that galaxies formed though a continuous and regular hierarchical process .",
    "we therefore embed the model for a single merger into a cosmological context by combining it with a merger tree .",
    "this approach allows us to describe a system in which lots of dm satellites fall into the galactic potential well .",
    "furthermore , it produces a more realistic estimate of the final velocity distribution of the galactic halo than the one presented in paper i because the merger tree describes a halo of @xmath15 , which has not undergone any recent major merger , as in the milky way .",
    "the tree has been kindly generated by andrew benson , using a semi - analytic method ( cole et al .",
    "2000 , parkinson et al .",
    "2008 ) based on the assumption of the following cosmological parameters :   @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the information provided by the merger tree are the virial mass @xmath21 of the merging subhalos and the scale factor @xmath22 at which they fall into the main progenitor .",
    "the mass resolution of the tree is @xmath23 .",
    "+ knowing the epoch in the past at which each satellite falls into the milky way s halo and the initial position of the merging satellite in phase - space at that time , ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , the model evolves the system analytically backwards in time .",
    "this allows us to map out the full velocity distribution within the `` ideal '' detector , which is located at the solar position , at a distance @xmath24 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "we assume that each subhalo falls into the host system on a radial orbit from a random position on a sphere of radius @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the ( redshift dependent ) virial radius of the milky way halo .",
    "experiments reveal that these assumptions are not critical . for example , replacing the radial orbits with orbits that have a peri - to - apo - centre ratio of 1:6 , the median found in cosmological simulations ( ghigna et al .  1998 , diemand et al .  2008 ) , results in velocity distributions that are indistinguishable .",
    "similarly , starting the disintegration of each subhalo at its first pericentre passage rather than at the milky way s virial radius on its initial infall does not substantively alter the final velocity distribution .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is approximated by the velocity of a body falling from an infinite distance , @xmath28 finally , we use the virial theorem @xmath29 and the definition of virial mass @xmath30 to relate the velocity dispersion , the spatial extent and the virial mass .",
    "the virial overdensity @xmath31 is defined as the density relative to the mean density within @xmath26 times the critical density @xmath32 at that redshift ( bryan & norman 1998 ) , and @xmath33 is the critical density . assuming a value for the concentration parameter @xmath34 ( bullock et al . 2001 ; benson 2005 ) , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dispersions1 ] ) - ( [ eq : dispersions2 ] ) give an estimate of the two characteristic scales of the merging subhalo .",
    "+ to summarise , the principal steps of this modelling process are :    * pick a merger tree that gives a realistic representation of a milky way - like system . *",
    "calculate the initial conditions for each subhalo in the merger tree .",
    "* evaluate the velocity distribution , observable within the detector for each subhalo , using the model developed in paper i. * evaluate the total velocity distribution by summing all the constituent mergers .",
    "the model we have developed above is not intended to predict in quantitative detail the experimental signal that a terrestrial detector would observe . nevertheless , it is interesting to define quantities related to the ones measured by directional detectors , with the aim of investigating qualitatively the properties of the system . in section 3.1",
    "we first determine the local dm energy spectrum of a milky way - like halo as a quantity that can be directly measured by experiments .",
    "secondly , we present the velocity distribution as a function of direction and speed , quantities that can give important indications about the evolution history of the galactic halo . in section 3.2",
    "we present the contribution to the velocity distribution produced by the addition of a new progenitor to the same milky way - like halo , in order to determine if late - merging subhalos might be detectable .",
    "the merger history of this halo of @xmath15 does not include any recent major merger .",
    "one velocity - unit corresponds to @xmath35 km s@xmath36.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    , of the velocity - squared of the galactic halo simulated in figure [ fig : smooth_original ] from a smooth distribution for an evolution time @xmath37 gyr . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_spectrum ] , one velocity - unit corresponds to @xmath35 km s@xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]     the energy spectrum is an observable quantity , and the analysis of its features can shed light on the evolution history of a system .",
    "for example , the particles of a stream produced by the recent merger of a subhalo normally group around particular values of the energy , forming `` overdensities '' . fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_spectrum ] presents the energy spectrum of the galactic halo for an evolution time of @xmath38gyr . in the plot",
    "we see that the energy spectrum does not show any small - scale feature .",
    "this smoothness arises because the halo is composed of a number of particles large enough to wash out any possible `` overdensity '' produced by single streams . to determine the level of residuals from a completely smooth distribution , we compare the current configuration to that obtained by evolving the system to many times the current age of the milky way , thus ensuring that it is fully relaxed . the fractional departure from this relaxed configuration",
    "is then given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of particles in a range of velocities at @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the number of objects in the same range once the system is relaxed .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : df1_departure ] we present @xmath43 for the same system as fig . [",
    "fig : energy_spectrum ] . from the plot it is evident that the fractional departure is absolutely indiscernible from the distribution that the halo assumes when completely relaxed .",
    "the absence of any feature leads to the conclusion that the ultra - fine dm distribution in the solar neighbourhood is composed of a huge number of streams .",
    "these overdense structures , clearly visible when we analyse the interaction of a single satellite , overlap , generating a smooth dm distribution and consequently a featureless fractional departure .    in principle , more information might be preserved if we look at the full velocity distribution as a function of angle , as recorded by some dm detectors .",
    "[ fig : smooth_original ] is a representation of the velocity distribution @xmath44 of the milky way - like halo simulated above in the @xmath45 space , where @xmath46 is defined as the angle at which dm particles enter the detector , measured relative to the direction of solar motion in the milky way .",
    "the plot is grey - scaled , and the shade of each pixel covers a range of six orders of magnitude in @xmath44 .",
    "this range is large enough to show the most significant contributions to the velocity distribution of the system .",
    "assuming @xmath47 km s@xmath36 , a value slightly larger than the escape speed from the milky way ( @xmath48 km s@xmath36 , smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , and @xmath49 km s@xmath36 , the velocity resolution of each cell along the @xmath50-axis is @xmath51 km s@xmath36 .",
    "the angular resolution varies between @xmath52 ( for small angles ) and @xmath53 ( for large angles ) . to investigate the presence of overdensities in the angle distribution",
    "we apply a boxcar smoothing technique .",
    "this removes all the small differences in the velocity - space distribution , mainly due to pixelation artifacts .",
    "[ fig : smooth_original ] shows that in a system resembling our galaxy no clear features are present , except for a central overdensity .",
    "the overdensities are relative to the surrounding pixels .",
    "the fact that the overdensities are not easily distinguishable means that a full quantitative analysis is not justified , but there is clearly information in these structures .",
    "the particles composing this region have velocities in the range @xmath54 km s@xmath55 km",
    "s@xmath36 , which in the plot correspond to @xmath56 , and angles @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . a second level of overdensities seems to be present in the same region , though it is difficult to separate them from the main one .",
    "these weak features are due to recent and incomplete merger activity , and their existence raises the possibility of disentangling at least the recent merger history of the halo .",
    "this could be achieved by directional detectors with angle and velocity resolution of @xmath59 and @xmath51 km s@xmath36 . + an investigation on the origin of these two levels of overdensities can be carried out by analysing the contributions to the final velocity distribution of progenitors with similar mass . using the same smoothing technique applied above , in figure 5 we group together the satellites with mass of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the three groups we adopt are : @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "5a ) , @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "5b ) and @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "the three figures show that the contributions from these groups of subhalos are heterogeneous .",
    "the number of direct progenitors in the range of mass @xmath60 is large ( @xmath63 ) and their total contribution to the final velocity - space distribution is not negligible .",
    "most of the particles have @xmath64 ( @xmath58 ) , but there is no evidence for a preferential range of velocity .",
    "this is due to the fact that these progenitors are compact and the timescale on which they get disrupted is longer than that of more massive systems . as a consequence , even after an evolution time equal to the milky way s age they are not completely disrupted . + looking at fig . 5b and",
    "5c we note that the contributions produced by subhalos of mass @xmath65 and @xmath66 are very similar .",
    "a significant difference can be seen : the velocity distribution produced by @xmath67 subhalos does not show any particular feature , while that from @xmath68 satellites has a central overdensity .",
    "this suggests that the most pronounced overdensity of fig .",

    "the method we adopt to investigate this issue consists of adding a dm satellite to the galactic halo and of analysing its contribution to the final velocity - space distribution .",

    ", we consider four different cases : @xmath72 ,   @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the main reason that motivates the limit of @xmath75 is the absence of major mergers in the recent history of the milky way , based on theoretical considerations which show that the accretion of a @xmath76 satellite galaxy could destroy the disk of the milky way ( purcell et al .",

    "<S> conventional n - body simulations are unable to access this scale , making the development of other approaches necessary . in this paper , we apply the method developed in @xcite to a cosmologically - based merger tree , transforming it into a useful instrument to reproduce and analyse the merger history of a milky way - like system . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the model is to investigate the implications of any ultrafine structure for the current and next generation of directional dark matter detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the velocity distribution of a milky way - like galaxy is almost smooth , due to the overlap of many streams of particles generated by multiple mergers . </S>",
    "<S> only the merger of a @xmath0 analyse can generate significant features in the ultra - local velocity distribution , detectable at the resolution attainable by current experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> [ firstpage ]    methods : numerical - galaxy : evolution - galaxy : halo - galaxy : kinematics and dynamics - galaxy : solar neighbourhood - dark matter </S>"
