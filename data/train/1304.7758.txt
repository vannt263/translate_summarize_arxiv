    "recently the study of neutron stars has become an ever more active field of research since it complements the investigations of matter under extreme conditions in heavy - ion collisions and in ab - initio lattice qcd simulations .",
    "the interiors of compact stars are unique places to investigate the otherwise inaccessible cold , dense equation of state ( eos ) which determines the shape of of stable compact star sequence(s ) in the mass - radius diagram as well as other properties like the composition , the moment of inertia etc . in this regard ,",
    "recently the masses of two heavy compact stars have been precisely measured : 1.97 @xmath6 0.04 m@xmath7 for psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite and 2.01 @xmath6 0.04 m@xmath7 for psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite , presenting a stringent constraint on models for the high density eos .",
    "would it be possible to gain evidence for a strong first order deconfinement transition in compact stars this would prove the existence of at least one cep in the qcd phase diagram since in the high temperature region explored by lattice qcd simulations @xcite the transition is crossover .",
    "a first order phase transition in neutron star matter can take place just as in symmetric matter where it is searched for in heavy ion collisions . adopting the setting of @xcite",
    ", we construct hybrid stars with a hybrid eos composed of a given hadronic eos , here dd2",
    "@xcite , and a quark matter eos parametrized by its squared speed of sound @xmath8 which pretty well describes @xcite results of a color superconducting njl model  @xcite @xmath9 the critical energy density @xmath10 and the discontinuity @xmath11 complete the eos model which is capable of describing compact star sequences with a third family of stars in the mass - radius diagram @xcite . searching for sequences obeying the mass constraint @xcite we obtain a quasi - horizontal branch disconnected from the almost vertical neutron star branch , as a consequence of a strong phase transition .",
    "[ eos ] shows the eos ( [ eos ] ) for the parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mev/@xmath3 .",

    "also shown : causality constraint ( upper left forbidden area ) and the minimal radius constraint from rxj 1856 - 3754 @xcite.,width=453 ]",
    "in this work we have demonstrated for a simple hybrid star eos model that the characteristic mass - radius relationship of nonrotating compact star configurations obtained by solving the tov equations has a third family of stable hybrid stars at high masses that is in accordance with astrophysical observations .",
    "this includes in particular the constraint for the minimal radius from rxj 1856 - 3754 and the new pulsar mass measurements for psr j1614 - 2230 and psr j0348 + 0432 at about 2 m@xmath0 .",
    "our result shows that stars of this high mass which are the best candidates for containing exotic matter ( like quark matter ) in their interiors could actually be approximate mass twins : although having about the same mass their interiors may show a vastly different composition : while the lower density twin has a larger radius ( @xmath19 km ) and is made of nuclear matter only , the high - density twin is more compact ( @xmath20 km ) with a phase transition at about half the stars radius . the precise determination of compact star radii would allow to prove or disprove whether the sequences of stable stars in the mass - radius diagram form a pattern like the one discussed here : with an almost vertical branch of hadronic stars and an almost horizontal branch of hybrid stars , possibly disconnected from the former thus representing a `` third family '' of compact stars and allowing for high - mass star twins . identifying this pattern by observation",
    "would indicate that compact star matter undergoes a phase transformation with a large jump in energy density that could correspond to a strong first order transition in symmetric matter .",
    "given the knowledge from lattice qcd that at zero baryon density the qcd phase transition proceeds as a crossover , twins would then support the existence of a cep in the qcd phase diagram , see also @xcite for a microphysical study .",
