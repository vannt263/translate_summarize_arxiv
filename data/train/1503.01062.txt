    "the past decade was marked by great achievements in gravitational - wave ( gw ) instrumental science .",
    "the international network of gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors , comprising three ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ) detectors @xcite and the ego ( european gravitational observatory ) detector virgo @xcite has reached the project sensitivity and has accomplished 6 runs of scientific data collection .",
    "apart from setting limits on a population of various sources of gravitational radiation in our galaxy and beyond @xcite , all detectors in the network have reached hitherto unseen displacement sensitivity of @xmath0  m/@xmath1 , making them , perhaps , the most sensitive displacement sensors in the world .",
    "the figure @xmath2  m/@xmath1 is remarkable by itself as it is only 1 order of magnitude above the magnitude of quantum zero - point fluctuations for a mechanical object with a mass of 10 kilogramms that is the mass of the ligo interferometer core optics mirrors .",
    "the second generation detectors , like advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , kagra @xcite and geo - hf @xcite will be already operating at the level of this quantum limit , meaning that their sensitivities will be governed by quantum fluctuations of light in the frequency band around 100  hz wherein most of the target gw sources are expected to emit .",
    "detection band below 100  hz will be dominated by quantum fluctuations of light amplitude , known as _ quantum radiation pressure noise _ ( rpn ) , while at higher frequencies detector sensitivity will be limited by quantum phase fluctuations , usually referred to as _ quantum shot noise _ ( sn ) .",
    "the best sensitivity point , where these two noise sources become equal , is known as the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite , which , in a broader context , characterises the regime in which the quantum measurement noise ( sn ) becomes equal to the back action noise ( rpn )  the latter one being a direct consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "the design and configuration of the third generation detectors remain an open question .",
    "however , there is a consensus in the community that they should have an order of magnitude better quantum noise than their predecessors @xcite in as broad frequency band as possible . at the same time",
    ", this sensitivity gain should be achieved in as economic way as possible , which implies that a single - interferometer solution should be favoured over any multi - interferometer ones . in this article",
    ", we argue that the most efficient way towards broadband quantum noise suppression goes via the change of interferometer configuration .",
    "we show that sagnac interferometer has superior potential for broadband sensitivity gain compared to michelson interferometer for any given set of advanced interferometric techniques , _",
    "i.e. _ signal recycling @xcite , squeezed vacuum injection @xcite , frequency - dependent phase rotation of squeezed vacuum phase @xcite _ etc_. we also demonstrate that better broadband performance is exhibited by sagnac interferometer with significantly relaxed requirements to auxiliary optics and thereby at much lower cost .",

    "these results answer the question : what is the best single interferometer configuration that has quantum noise as broadband and as low as the total noise of the aligo broadband baseline configuration @xcite and of the et - d xylophone configuration @xcite , respectively , for a given set of advanced interferometric techniques",

    "table  [ tab : si_vs_mi_best ] clearly demonstrates sagnac scheme advantage over michelson in an entire frequency band .",
    "noteworthy is the fact that this excellent result can be achieved with a single filter cavity with rather realistic optical loss , 1 ppm / metre , that can be already achieved in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "before we move on to details of quantum noise calculations of considered interferometer schemes , it is important to have an agreement on how to rate those configurations against their ability to detect gws . quantum noise of the 3rd generation interferometers is a complicated interplay of several advanced quantum techniques , mentioned above .",
    "it results in a quite complex dependence of the interferometer sensitivity on a multitude of parameters .",
    "this raises a question of optimisation of quantum noise curve and finding the best combination of those parameters .",
    "but what `` the best '' means in this context .",
    "how do we define the criterion that resolves what configuration is better than the others ?",
    "many different answers were given to this question in the literature .",
    "some optimised the interferometer signal - to - noise ratio for specific gw sources @xcite .",
    "for instance , the most popular figure of merit in gw community , the detection range , is nothing more than a renormalised snr for the detection of gws emitted by an etalon compact binary system ( comprised of neutron stars or black holes ) in the course of inspiralling phase of their evolution .",
    "more general criterion was proposed in @xcite , where the optimisation seeks to provide the broadest possible total noise curve ( a sum of a quantum noise and other classical noise sources ) , thereby seeking to include as many various astrophysical sources in the detection band of the antenna , as possible . in both cases , however , the optimisation depended heavily on the model of non - quantum noise for a specific project , _ i.e. _ aligo , or einstein telescope .",
    "we argue that this approach is very restrictive and does not allow to reveal the potential of different interferometer configurations in full , for it is squeezed into a narrow frame of existing noise models .",
    "nevertheless , we know examples when a new technology comes into play and predictions of classical noise models have to be revised dramatically @xcite .    in this paper , we suggest that quantum noise of different configurations shall be compared against the limitations of quantum origin .",
    "namely , we suggest that a lower bound of quantum noise , which all considered configurations shall be compared against , is to be derived as a sum of limitations imposed by two main parameters for any quantum noise - limited interferometer , _",
    "i.e. _ the level of optical loss in the main optics and the finite optical power circulating therein .",
    "incoherent loss - associated vacuum fields that enter the interferometer in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite create random radiation pressure force that can not be compensated by any quantum technique .",
    "if , due to various reasons , the total fraction @xmath28 of all photons that enter the interferometer is lost therein , and if the effective squeezing of vacuum injected in the dark port is given by a factor @xmath29 [ see eq . ] , the ultimate limit for residual radiation pressure noise ( in gw strain spectral density units ) reads ( cf .",

    "we will use this limit as a first component of our qn lower bound curve .",
    "high frequency region of all interferometers is dominated by shot noise , or quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "its rise on upper frequencies is determined by a finite bandwidth , @xmath34 , of the detector . for a simple resonance - tuned fabry - perot interferometer with squeezed vacuum and lossy optics ,",

    "the fabry - prot interferometer is fully equivalent to a signal - recycled fabry - prot  michelson interferometer in terms of quantum noise with ( in the the only substitution of @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for light power circulating in the first one . for fixed bandwidth @xmath43  s@xmath44 ,",

    "in this section , we concentrate solely on quantum fluctuations of light and the influence they have on the sensitivity of the gw detector based on sagnac interferometer topology .",
    "the power of sagnac interferometer ( si ) to reduce back - action noise is nested in its ability to sense the relative rate , or in other words speed of an arm cavities length variation , whereas michelson interferometer senses arms length variation itself .",
    "the simple way to understand how a speed measurement can reduce back - action is to consider a simple thought experiment depicted in fig .",

    "as shown by caves and schumaker in @xcite , quantum noise of light in any parametric optical device can be conveniently described within the frames of two - photon formalism .",
    "namely , noise can be considered as tiny stochastic variations of quadratures of carrier field travelling through the device .",
    "any variations of interferoemeter parameters due to signal force , _",
    "e.g. _ differential arms length change in gw interferometer , also lead to variation of outgoing light quadratures and thus can be described using the same formalism .    in two - photon formalism ,",
    "one starts with writing the input and outgoing light fields of the interferometer at some fixed location via its _ sine _ and _ cosine _ quadratures : @xmath59\\,,\\\\    \\hat{e}^{out}(t ) & = & \\mathcal{e}_0\\left[(b^{out}+\\hat{b}^{out}_c)\\cos\\omega_p t+\\hat{b}^{out}_s\\sin\\omega_pt\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is classical mean amplitude of the input ( output ) light at pump laser frequency @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) are small quantum variations and variations due to signal force that can be defined through creation and annihilation operators as @xmath65 and similarly for outgoing fields .",
    "note that we do not specify time as an argument here , as the same definition holds in spectral domain that we make use of in the rest of this article .",
    "these two domains are connected through fourier transform as follows : @xmath66    so , in order to fully describe signal and noise in a ( lossless ) gw interferometer it is sufficient to track the transformation it does to the quadrature operators of input light that can be represented in a matrix form as transformations of 2-dimensional vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 and gw signal @xmath69 . for gw detector",
    "it can be written in general form as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the optical transfer matrix of the interferometer , @xmath72 is an optical response of the interferometer on an external influence that is denoted as @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the corresponding sql for the mechanical degree of freedom of the interferometer expressed in units of @xmath73 . in gw interferometry @xmath73 is either the displacement of the mirrors , @xmath75 , or the external force , @xmath76 , that causes this displacement , or , more habitually , the gw strain , @xmath77 . in each case , the corresponding sql applies .",
    "the relation between these three quantities is discussed in sec .",

    "we deal with _ single - sided _ spectral densities @xmath89 and hence in case of input vacuum state : @xmath90    now with all necessary tools in hand we can proceed with the analysis of sagnac interferometer and derive spectral density of quantum noise for it .",
    "first we consider a bare lossless zero - area sagnac interferometer and derive its input - output ( i / o ) relations.for definiteness , in this section , we stick to a configuration of sagnac interferometer that utilises ring arm cavities ( as per the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : sagnacfig ] ) , although the results we obtain are applicable to both realisations unless loss is taken into account .",
    "unlike michelson interferometer , in sagnac interferometer light beam visits two arm cavities before recombination with a counter - rotating beam at the beam splitter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sagnacfig ] ) . at the same time , two light beams hit the cavity , one coming directly from the beam splitter and the one , that has just left another arm . in notations of chen s paper @xcite quadrature operators of light",
    "enter ing and leaving the arm can be identified with two indices @xmath91 , _ e.g. _",

    "the final , approximate expressions above are obtained assuming that cavity linewidth and signal frequency are much smaller than cavity free spectral range @xmath107 .",
    "this approximation nearly breaks down for detectors with arm length @xmath108  km , like einstein telescope , at frequencies of the order of 10  khz , therefore we present exact formulae as well .",
    "then , it is straightforward to derive full sagnac i / o - relations , using junction equations for the fields at the output beam splitter ( ring - cavity topology ) : @xmath109 as well as continuity relations between the beams that leave one arm and enter the other : @xmath110",

    "a scheme of signal recycling cavity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : srczoom ] .",
    "essentially , it acts as a feedback loop for the light leaving the main interferometer , and its sign is defined by the phase shift signal light acquires in a round trip across the signal recycling cavity ( src ) .",
    "the feedback features of the src become evident if one writes down the i / o - relations for the lossless signal recycled interferometer in matrix form : @xmath121 where    [ eq : sr_t_and_t ] @xmath122    with @xmath123 and @xmath124 are sr mirror amplitude reflectivity and transmissivity (",

    "a general case of arbitrary src detuning and lossy interferometer is considered in appendices  [ app : sriorels ]  and  [ app : pbs leak i / o - relations ] . here",
    "we only give expressions for two special cases known as resonant sideband extraction ( rse ) @xcite and tuned signal recycling ( tsr ) @xcite that stand for the cases of src tuned in anti - resonance and in resonance , respectively .    in terms of control theory ,",
    "the first one corresponds to a negative feedback , as the light reflected off the sr mirror enters the interferometer with the opposite sign ( @xmath129 phase shift in a full round trip in the src ) .",
    "the second case gives a positive feedback ( light returns to the interferometer in the same phase ) .",
    "intermediate case is more complicated as it involves modification of the test masses dynamics by means of creating an optical spring @xcite .    substituting eq .   into eq .   with @xmath130 ( tsr ) and @xmath131 ( rse ) ,",
    "one arrives at i / o - relations of a form identical to that of eq .  , but with modified optomechanical coupling strength and overall phase shift that read :    @xmath132    where we denote tsr case by `` + '' and rse case by `` - '' in accordance with the sign of feedback it creates .    in approximation of @xmath133 ,",
    "the expressions for @xmath134 transform as : @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "this approximate form clearly displays the effect of signal recycling on quantum noise : it makes the overall bandwidth of the interferometer wider at the expense of lower peak sensitivity , when feedback is negative , _",

    "the appearance of @xmath79 in the off - diagonal component of the light field transfer matrix @xmath116 is responsible for the transformation of the quantum state of light , passing through the interferometer , known as ponderomotive squeezing .",

    "<S> albeit ingenious , it is a rather costly solution . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that changing the optical scheme to a sagnac interferometer with weak detuned signal recycling and frequency dependent input squeezing can do almost as good a job , as the xylophone for significantly lower spend . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the sagnac interferometer is more robust to optical loss in filter cavity , used for frequency dependent squeezed vacuum injection , than an analogous michelson interferometer , thereby reducing building cost even more . </S>"
