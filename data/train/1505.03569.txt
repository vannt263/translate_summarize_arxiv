    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show a large variety of observational properties despite being universally driven by accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes .",
    "their ubiquitous nature and complex interplay with their host galaxies make agn essential elements of any model of galaxy evolution .",
    "since their discovery in the 1950s , agn have been observationally classified into a number of different types depending on the particular wavelength range used for the observations .",
    "unification models for agn were developed later , explaining the differences between some agn types solely in terms of viewing angle .",
    "an essential part of these models is the so - called agn torus : a geometrically and optically thick structure filled with molecular gas and dust surrounding the active nucleus .",
    "the agn torus has a geometry that allows radiation to escape freely in certain directions but not in others , rendering samples of objects selected at x - ray , ultra - violet ( uv ) and visible wavelengths largely inapplicable for testing unification models .",
    "radio - selected agn are particularly well - suited for testing the unification model , because when selected based on their extended ( well outside the torus ) , low - frequency , transparent ( i.e. optically thin ) radio emission they show no bias with respect to orientation .",
    "the unification model for powerful radio - loud agn postulates that radio galaxies ( rgs ) are viewed edge - on so that the torus obscures the active nucleus and nearby broad - line emitting regions , while quasars ( qsrs ) are the same objects , but viewed with a face - on torus so that the nuclear regions and broad emission lines are directly visible .",
    "the validity of the unification model for powerful radio - loud agn has been examined using a variety of orientation - dependent properties ( recently reviewed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the radio @xcite , mid - infrared ( mir ) @xcite , and x - ray @xcite domains .",
    "if the unification model holds , then any isotropic ( orientation invariant ) property must be comparable for samples of rgs and qsrs with matched low - frequency radio properties .",
    "one such an isotropic candidate is the far - infrared ( fir ) emission , which is dominated by star - formation - heated dust on the scale of the host galaxy , but may also include a contribution from optically thin , agn - powered emission from the torus .",
    "due to sensitivity issues , earlier fir studies relied on relatively small samples of mostly nearby , less luminous sources , and therefore failed to provide robust conclusions on the unification model for powerful radio - loud agn in the fir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite , with its unprecedented sensitivity , resolution , and wavelength coverage for the first time permits rest - frame fir tests of unification for distant radio - loud agn which have hitherto been outside the reach of infrared space missions . in order to test the unification model in the fir ,",
    "we study the complete @xmath0 3cr sample of powerful ( l@xmath1 @xmath2 5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 w hz@xmath5 ) radio - loud agn @xcite using the two _ herschel _ imaging photometers : pacs at 70 and 160  @xmath6 m @xcite and spire at 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath6 m @xcite .",
    "the extreme luminosities of our sample objects ensure that all objects are highly accreting ; none of them is classified as a low - ionization emission - line source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the _ herschel _ data , the availability of ancillary _ spitzer _ @xcite data at wavelengths between 3.6 and 24  @xmath6 m @xcite allows us to obtain physical properties of the 3cr hosts by fitting their full infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with a combination of four components , as explained in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these components include emission from the circumnuclear , agn - heated torus dust , from the extended star - formation - heated cold dust , from the evolved stellar populations , and from hot nuclear graphite dust .",
    "the best - fit seds of our 61 3cr hosts were recently presented in @xcite .",
    "twenty - three hosts in the sample ( presented in table  [ tab1 ] ) have good signal - to - noise detections in at least three _ herschel _ bands , typically the three shortest bands , resulting in estimated star formation rates ( sfrs ) of order hundreds of solar masses per year , coeval with the black hole activity @xcite . such prodigious sfrs , at the level of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , have similarly been inferred in other studies of high-@xmath7 radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a simpler but revealing way to look at the shapes of seds is to employ colors .",
    "infrared color - color diagrams are widely used to separate agn from non - agn in wide-/deep - field galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the best - fit seds of the 23 3cr objects detected in at least three _ herschel _ bands , we create rest - frame color - color diagrams from their hosts dust emission at 5 , 20 , 70 , and 100  @xmath6 m .",
    "the emission at the former two wavelengths is mainly agn - powered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the emission at the latter two wavelengths is predominantly star - formation - powered @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show infrared color - color diagrams for this sample of 13 rgs and 10 qsrs .",
    "the distributions of f@xmath8/f@xmath9 @xmath10 hz@xmath5 ] color for rgs and qsrs in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are nearly identical , with median values 0.9 . the color coding in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) demonstrates that the factor of @xmath122 scatter around the median fir colors results from differences in the cold dust temperatures of individual objects , which range from @xmath13 to @xmath14  k @xcite .",
    "the emission from hosts with dust temperatures @xmath15 33  k peaks at wavelengths @xmath2 70  @xmath6 m resulting in f@xmath8/f@xmath9 @xmath2 1 .",
    "we apply both maximum likelihood and empirical methods to statistically compare the measured rg and qsr f@xmath8/f@xmath9 colors . assuming that the colors are normally distributed , we compute the parameters of the distributions which maximize the probability of measuring such colors .",
    "the means and standard deviations of these maximum likelihood distributions are 1.0 and 0.2 , respectively , for both the rgs and qsrs .",
    "the corresponding maximum likelihood cumulative distribution functions and the empirical ( measured ) cumulative distributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left ) .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test reveals that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution ( ks@xmath16=0.07 , p=1 ) .",
    "we conclude that the fir colors of these 3cr rgs and qsrs are indistinguishable ( i.e. , orientation invariant ) , as expected in the unification model for agn host galaxies with similar star formation rates .",
    "in contrast , the rgs and qsrs show clear separation in their f@xmath9/f@xmath17 colors ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left ) : their median colors are 101.4 and 13.9 , respectively .",
    "one rg , 3c  119 , has colors which overlap the qsrs in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) , not surprisingly , because 3c  119 is a well - known @xcite borderline source where some of the hot dust is visible , and the uv / visible agn continuum is only partly hidden",
    ". the 5  @xmath6 m emission of another rg , 3c  222 , is only weakly constrained @xcite , resulting in an unusually red f@xmath9/f@xmath17 color for this object . considering this particular value as an upper limit",
    ", we obtain ks@xmath16=0.92 ( p=5@xmath310@xmath18 ) , and maximum likelihood distributions as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( middle ) .",
    "these clearly different distributions are driven by the differences between the rg and qsr seds at 5  @xmath6 m .",
    "rgs are fainter than qsrs at 5  @xmath6 m , as expected if their hot inner torus dust emission is obscured due to its edge - on viewing angle @xcite .",
    "our results support the hypothesis that f@xmath9/f@xmath17 to a large extent reveals the level of obscuration in powerful radio - loud objects , and as such is an orientation indicator for that agn population . however , intrinsic differences in this ratio for individual objects are not ruled out , and may contribute to the observed scatter .",
    "although our adopted sed - fitting approach is physically grounded and provides us with a close approximation of the objects infrared seds , we further explore the robustness of the results presented above without using dust emission models .",
    "to this end , we employ a simple ( model - independent ) linear interpolation of the observed flux values to obtain the rest - frame colors and create the color - color diagrams .",
    "we apply this method to the sample of objects detected in at least three _ herschel _ bands , and find that the rgs and qsrs remain clearly separated in the f@xmath9/f@xmath17 color , with median values of 83.9 and 12.3 , respectively .",
    "their respective median f@xmath8/f@xmath9 colors ( 1.0 and 0.9 ) remain indistinguishable , similarly to the results obtained when following the sed - fitting approach .    in addition to the 23 3cr hosts detected in at least three _ herschel _ bands ,",
    "seven hosts are detected in only the two pacs bands while remaining below the detection limit in the spire bands .",
    "given the low redshift range ( @xmath19 ) of five of these seven hosts , the pacs 160  @xmath6 m band probes their cold dust emission at rest - frame @xmath12 70  @xmath6 m allowing their inclusion ( empty symbols ) in the color - color diagrams presented in fig .",
    "while this inclusion does not change the trends discussed above , their f@xmath9/f@xmath17 colors tend to be somewhat bluer than the median colors of the 23 objects detected in at least three _ herschel _ bands .",
    "this is likely a consequence of their lower levels of star formation @xcite . as such",
    ", it is important to note that the present fir test of unification can directly be applied only to the long wavelength detected , i.e. , the star - forming objects from the high-@xmath7 3cr sample .",
    "the 31 remaining hosts from the sample , which are either detected only in the pacs 70  @xmath6 m band or not detected at all , have weak or absent star formation and thus no definitive conclusions can be drawn . nevertheless , the non - detection fractions at spire 250  @xmath6 m for rgs and qsrs are comparable ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively ) , and thus do not represent evidence against the unification model .    the high level of obscuration in the mir prevents the f@xmath9/f@xmath17 color from directly probing the relative importance of the sf and agn activity .",
    "we therefore use the agn - powered circumnuclear dust emission at 20  @xmath6 m , and employ the f@xmath9/f@xmath22 color to probe the dominant power source in the infrared . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) , the f@xmath9/f@xmath22 rg and qsr colors are closer to each other than the f@xmath9/f@xmath17 colors , but still have an offset , with median values of 3.4 and 1.8 respectively ( ks@xmath16=0.65 , p=0.01 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right ) , confirming that the level of obscuration at 20  @xmath6 m is substantially lower than that at 5  @xmath6 m .",
    "the symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) are color - coded according to the fractional star formation luminosity , l@xmath23/l@xmath24 , as inferred in @xcite .",
    "this color - coding demonstrates that , despite the strong star formation activity of several hundreds of solar masses per year , the total infrared luminosity of the 3cr hosts is generally dominated by their agn activity , regardless if that activity is obscured or not @xcite .",
    "the only exceptions are two rgs , 3c  266 and 3c  222 , which have similar l@xmath23 but lower ir agn luminosities than the other rgs @xcite . however , a general increase in the l@xmath23/l@xmath24 ratio of 3cr objects , from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , is observed when progressing to larger f@xmath9/f@xmath22 values , i.e. , to redder colors .",
    "we examine this trend further by comparing the 3cr agn infrared colors to those of typical star - forming ( sf ) galaxies where the infrared emission draws uniquely from star formation .",
    "the sfr strongly correlates with stellar mass and redshift @xcite ; we therefore select @xmath27 sf galaxies from @xcite with stellar masses and redshifts comparable to those of the 3cr hosts ( which have m@xmath28 @xmath29 10@xmath30 m@xmath31 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given that stars in these sf galaxies are formed at rates @xcite comparable to those in the 3cr hosts , the l@xmath23/l@xmath24@xmath121 of the sf galaxies are consistent with their red f@xmath9/f@xmath22 colors ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] right ) .",
    "the bluer f@xmath9/f@xmath22 colors of the powerful 3cr agn are likely a consequence of the strong torus emission at 20  @xmath6 m .",
    "the average cold dust temperature of the sf galaxies is 28@xmath322  k @xcite , hence their fir colors are also consistent with the temperature trends found for the 3cr hosts .",
    "the f@xmath9/f@xmath22 colors of powerful agn are offset from those of sf galaxies , and hence , in addition to being indicators of orientation , fir / mir colors also distinguish between active and sf galaxies in the most luminous star - forming objects , analogous to the case for local seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a limitation for the general unification discussion is the fact that radio - loud agn , such as the 3cr sources investigated here , represent a small ( @xmath25 ) fraction of the complete agn population .",
    "it is therefore important to compare the colors of the powerful 3cr radio - loud agn to those of powerful radio - quiet agn . to achieve this",
    ", we select a sample of distant ( @xmath33 1.9 ) , luminous , radio - quiet agn ( l@xmath34 @xmath12 5@xmath310@xmath35 erg s@xmath5 ) hosted by massive ( m@xmath28 @xmath12 10@xmath30 m@xmath31 ) star - forming galaxies , from @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) the radio - quiet agn have f@xmath9/f@xmath22 colors redder than those of the 3cr rgs , but bluer than those of the sf galaxies .",
    "given that the sf activity in these radio - quiet agn accounts for 56% of the total infrared luminosity @xcite , this finding agrees with the trend of increasing l@xmath23/l@xmath24 towards larger f@xmath9/f@xmath22 values for the 3cr objects discussed above .",
    "in conclusion , far- to mid - infrared colors represent a useful diagnostic of the orientation of powerful radio - loud agn , and support the unification model for these objects . at wavelengths longer than 20  @xmath6 m , where obscuration is a small effect , these colors are also indicators of the relative contributions of star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies .",
    "these diagnostics may prove useful in future studies of large samples of dusty star - forming galaxies / agn to investigate the duty cycle of nuclear activity , feedback , and agn and galaxy growth .",
