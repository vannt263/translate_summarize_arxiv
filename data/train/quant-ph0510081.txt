    "the problem of accomodating time as a quantum dynamical observable has a long history and remains controversial to this day @xcite .",
    "the time of arrival ( toa ) of a quantum structureless particle at a point or a surface is one aspect of this problematic treatment of time in quantum mechanics in need of clarification @xcite .",
    "recently significant progress has been made , both at the operational and foundational fronts for the quantum time of arrival problem .",
    "most notable at the operational level is the convergence of several analyses of the problem to the axiomatic distribution of arrival for freely moving particles due to kijowski @xcite .",
    "kijowski s distribution was first obtained operationally ( under some limiting conditions ) by allcock @xcite and later shown to be arising from the quantization of the classical time - of - arrival @xcite , inspiring extension of the theory to the interacting case @xcite or multiparticle systems @xcite .",
    "most important of these developments in understanding the physical content of kijowski distribution is the realization that , while axiomatic in nature , it can be obtained from an operational procedure @xcite , whose essence is to modify ( filter ) the initial state to counterbalance the disturbance introduced by the apparatus , in particular at low energies .    at the foundational level",
    ", it has been shown that the non - self - adjointness of the free time of arrival operator , widely regarded as due to the semiboundedness of the hamiltonian in accordance with pauli s theorem @xcite , can in fact be lifted by spatial confinement @xcite .",
    "thus the concept of confined quantum time of arrival ( ctoa ) was introduced @xcite .",
    "the ctoa - operators form a class of compact and self - adjoint operators canonically conjugate with their respective hamiltonians in a closed subspace of the system hilbert space . being compact , the ctoa - operators posses discrete spectrum , and a complete set of mutually orthogonal square integrable eigenfunctions .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the ctoa - operators are found to be states that evolve to unitarily ( i.e. according to schrodinger s equation ) arrive at the origin at their respective eigenvalues  that is the events of the centroid of the position distribution being at the origin and its width being minimum occur at the same instant of time .",
    "now we are confronted with the problem of relating the already established results for the unconfined quantum particle to the confined one , in particular the question whether the established kijowski time of arrival distribution is extractable or not from the confined time of arrival operators .",
    "therefore , in this paper we give meaning to the limit of the discrete time of arrival distribution of the ctoa - operators defined on succesively larger segments , proving that this limit is the kijowski s distribution .",
    "we begin by a short review of the properties of the confined and unconfined time of arrival operators ; this is followed by numerical indications of the relation between these two cases , numerical indications that are strengthened by the analytical proof of the following statement : the time of arrival operator on the full real line is the limit for @xmath0 tending to infinity of the time of arrival operators defined for free motion in a segment of length @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics of the ctoa - eigenfunctions are then numerically investigated in the limit of arbitrarilly large confining lengths .",
    "we end by summarising and providing conclusions .",
    "from a heuristic perspective , it is quite natural to assume that the quantum toa may be associated with the quantization of the corresponding classical expression .",
    "that is , if a classical free particle , of mass @xmath2 in one dimension at initial location @xmath3 with momentum @xmath4 , will arrive , say , at the origin at the time @xmath5 , then the quantum toa - distribution must be derivable from a quantization of @xmath6 , such as the symmetrized @xmath7 formally the time of arrival operator @xmath8 is canonically conjugate to the free hamiltonian , @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "equation-([toa ] ) has been separately studied when the motion of the free particle takes place in the entire real line and when it is restricted to a segment of the real line .",
    "these studies led to some seemingly contradictory descriptions , in that the time of arrival operator is not self - adjoint for the full real line , while there is an infinite family of self - adjoint operators playing the corresponding role for the segment .",
    "furthermore , for the full line case there is a well defined property of time covariance which is lacking in the confined case .      in momentum representation , eq .",
    "( [ toa ] ) formally assumes the form @xmath12 under a sensible choice of domain @xcite , @xmath8 is a densely defined operator , and unbounded in @xmath13 .",
    "it is however not self - adjoint , and admits no self - adjoint extension .",
    "it is in fact a maximally symmetric operator @xcite . according to the well - established theory for this kind of operator ,",
    "there exists a decomposition of unity given by the following degenerate weak ( or non - square integrable ) eigenfunctions @xmath14 this is a family of functions parametrized by the eigenvalue @xmath15 and a discrete parameter @xmath16 , which can be either @xmath17 or @xmath18 , and gives the sign of the half - line on which the function presents its support in momentum space .",
    "it is straightforward to prove completeness , i.e. , @xmath19 , and nonorthogonality , @xmath20 the physical content of the eigenfunctions is better examined in coordinate representation @xcite .",
    "normalized wave packets with the form of quasi - eigenstates of @xmath8 peaked at a given eigenvalue , but with a time width @xmath21 , have sharp space - time behaviour .",
    "their average position travels with constant velocity to arrive at the origin at the nominal arrival time of the packet , in which the packet also attains its minimum spatial width .",
    "the passage of probability density from one side of the origin to the other , is in summary as sharp as desired by taking @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "as we shall see later , the unitary evolution of a ( generalized ) state @xmath23 leads to a distribution with point support at the origin at the instant corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath15 , thus lending support to its interpretation as a time of arrival eigenstate .    using completeness ,",
    "we can now write the probability density for measured values of the @xmath8 operator , @xmath24 which is , in fact , kijowski s probability density @xcite .    an essential property of the distribution of arrivals in kijowski s axiomatic approach is covariance under transformations generated by the hamiltonian .",
    "it is evident that this property of covariance is indeed held by the distribution above .",
    "physically , it means that the probability of arriving at @xmath15 for a given state is equal to the probability of arriving at @xmath25 for the same state , once evolved a time @xmath26 .",
    "this is the reflection on the probability density of the canonical commutation relation between @xmath27 and @xmath8 .      in @xcite the naive definition in eq .",
    "( [ toa ] ) @xmath8 for a free particle in a segment of length @xmath1 is supplemented by adequate boundary conditions , leading to properly self - adjoint operators .",
    "physically , the choice of time of arrival operator with spatial confinement of the particle in the interval @xmath29 $ ] is dictated by the condition that the evolution of the system is generated by a purely kinetic self - adjoint hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a self - adjoint momentum operator .",
    "this requirement demands that the momentum operator @xmath31 be one of the set @xmath32 , with @xmath33 having the domain consisting of absolutely continuous functions @xmath34 in @xmath35 $ ] with square integrable first derivatives , which further satisfy the boundary condition @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath8 depends on the momentum operator , @xmath8 is also required to be the corresponding element of the set of operators @xmath37 .    in coordinate representation",
    ", @xmath38 becomes the fredholm integral operator @xmath39 for all @xmath40 in @xmath41 , where the kernel is given by @xmath42 @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is heaviside s step function and @xmath45 is the sign function .    with this representation , one can show that @xmath46 and @xmath38 form a canonical pair in a closed subspace of @xmath47a non - dense subspace  for every @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the kernel @xmath49 of @xmath38 is square integrable , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "this means that @xmath38 is compact , and , as a consequence , that it has a complete set of ( square integrable ) eigenfunctions and its spectrum is discrete .",
    "this , it should be stressed , is a radically different situation from that in the full line , where the operator has a continuous spectrum and is not self - adjoint .    in what follows",
    ", we will need only the spectral properties for the periodic confined quantum time of arrival operators ( that is to say , @xmath51 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath52 commutes with the parity operator .",
    "furthermore , it changes sign under time inversion , which entails that its spectrum is symmetric about 0 .",
    "this suggests classifying its eigenfunctions in even and odd subspaces ( which will be denoted by the subscripts @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively ) , and , within each of those subspaces , by a discrete index @xmath55 and the sign of the eigenvalue ( indicated as a superscript ) . in this manner , and as computed elsewhere @xcite , the odd eigenfunctions are @xmath56 with @xmath57 \\label{defnf}\\ ] ] while the even ones are given by @xmath58 with @xmath59+\\frac{e^{\\mp i r_n } j_{\\frac{1}{4}}(r_n)}{r_n^{\\frac{1}{4}}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{defng}\\ ] ] @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the normalization constants , while @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the solutions of the secular equations for the operator , namely the positive roots of @xmath64 for the even case and of @xmath65 for the odd case . the eigenvalues are determined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for either @xmath63 or @xmath62 .",
    "it has been demonstrated in @xcite that a ctoa eigenfunction is a state that evolves unitarily  that is according to schrodinger s equation  to being concentrated around the origin at its eigenvalue along a classical trajectory , i.e. a state in which the events of the centroid of the position distribution being at the origin and its width being minimum occur at the same instant of time equal to the eigenvalue .",
    "we have thus seen that the time of arrival operators for confined and unconfined free motion have radically different properties . and it is not immediate how kijowski s distribution follows from the spectral properties of the ctoa - operators . in this section we show that indeed kijowski s distribution is extractable from the discrete time of arrival distribution defined by the ctoa - operator . but before doing so we first provide further justification from numerical results .",
    "one basic difference between the two cases being examined is that the spectrum is continuous for the full line , whereas it is discrete for the segment . as a consequence ,",
    "the same can be predicated of the probability distributions for times of arrivals . therefore , in order to compare like with like , it is convenient to use the accumulated probability of having arrived at the origin before a given instant for both cases .    also in order to perform sensible comparisons we shall consider initial states with compact support on the real line , which can also be defined for all segments which would include that compact support . in this manner",
    "the probability of having arrived at the origin before instant @xmath15 can be computed for the same function both for the segment and the line .    in the case of the segment ,",
    "the probability of having arrived at the origin before instant @xmath15 for the initial state @xmath68 is calculated according to the standard quantum mechanical prescription , @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath38 .",

    "as the length of the segment @xmath0 increases , the discrete eigenvalues of the corresponding time of arrival operators become denser , and we take advantage of this property to have another representation for comparison with kijowski s distribution ; namely plotting kijowski s time of arrival density together with a discrete derivative of the probability of having arrived at the origin before a given instant , in the case of the segment , discrete derivative that can be understood as a time of arrival density .",

    "once we get the limit of infinite @xmath0 , we follow it with the limit in @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting limit is going to be kijowski s distribution because of the continuity of the inner product .",
    "we have shown above that kijowski distribution is the limit of the discrete distribution for arbitrarily large @xmath0 . but what physical insight can we get from this realization ? recall that one of the surrounding issues against an ideal quantum time of arrival distribution is the fact that a quantum particle losses the localized property of its corresponding classical particle entity .",
    "classically the concept of time of arrival is well - defined because a classical particle has a well defined trajectory .",
    "this is contrary to the fact that no such trajectory can be ascribed to the quantum particle  it has no definite position and momentum .",
    "now the theory of confined quantum time of arrivals demonstrates that the quantum time of arrival problem , at the ideal level , i.e. at the level where measuring instruments play no explicit role , can be rephrased to finding states that unitarily arrive at a given point at a definite time ",
    "states in which the events of the centroid being at the origin and the position distribution width being minimum occur at the same instant of time .",

    "for arbitrarily large lengths , we should have @xmath146 , so that in the limit of infinite lengths they converge to @xmath26 .    we know",
    "that the eigenfunctions @xmath147 will obtain their minimum variances at their respective eigenvalues @xmath148 .",
    "how do the variances compare for the different @xmath149 s ?",
    "equivalently , what is the behavior of the variance with respect to @xmath149 at the eigenvalue @xmath121 as @xmath0 approaches infinity ? in this case the variance increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this is not surprising because the @xmath149 s would be thrown out of the hilbert space for infinite @xmath0 , i.e. they acquire infinite variances .",
    "however , if we substitute [ width at half maximum ( whm ) of the probability density @xmath150 at the eigenvalue @xmath121 ] for the variance , we find that whm decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "figure-[fig3:mwm ] demonstrate this .",
    "what is even more important is that the density @xmath152 at the eigenvalue @xmath121 tends , as @xmath0 increases indefinitely , to a function with point support at the origin .",
    "figure-[fig2:mwm ] demonstrates this .",
    "these results imply that the ctoa - eigenfunctions in the limit of infinite @xmath0 ( which are already outside of the hilbert space ) evolve to `` collapse '' at the origin at their respective eigenvalues .",
    "this allows us to interpret kijowski s distribution as the ideal time of arrival distribution of collapsing states at the origin .     versus length @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",width=192,height=312 ]",

    "from a purely technical point of view , we have shown that kijowski s ( continuum ) time - of - arrival distribution for free , unconfined quantum particles can be obtained as the limit of the ( discrete ) distribution that results from quantizing the time of arrival in a finite box , taking into account the eigenvalue spacing in the transition from sums to integrals .",
    "note that the toa operator is not self - adjoint in the unconfined case , but it is self - adjoint in the box .",
    "there are several possible readings of this fact .",
    "we will point out some of them , with the aim of opening a public discussion on the fundamental issues involved , rather than to settle final answers and exhaustive explanations .",
    "for those following a traditional , von neumann s formulation of quantum mechanics , the connection with a self - adjoint operator may be satisfactory since , within this framework , all observables must be associated with self - adjoint operators .",
    "one of the customary roles of self - adjointness is to assure the orthogonality of eigenfunctions so that , according to the projection postulate , repeated measurements would give the same result .",
    "it turns out however , that this idealization is not applicable to many observables and/or measurement operations .",
    "in particular , improper eigenfunctions for observables with continuum spectrum ( such as momentum , energy or position on the line ) are not normalizable , and thus the collapse and repeated measurement idea can not be applied literally , even in principle , but only approximately .",
    "it seems then that , as long as some ideal probability distribution may be computed unambiguously , there is no fundamental need to have a self - adjoint operator in these cases .",
    "indeed , if one adopts the point of view that observables are best formulated in terms of povms @xcite , self - adjointness is not essential to describe observables .",
    "the eigenfunction orthogonality may however be seen anyway as a desirable , simplifying property , whereby a part ( component ) of the initial state is responsible for a given outcome ( eigenvalue ) and not for any other .",
    "what the present paper shows is that the time of arrival eigenfunctions in the unbounded case differ , appart from a normalization factor , only outside the large box or far from the arrival point at the origin .",
    "the nonorthogonality in the continuum is thus caused by the distant eigenfunction behaviour with negligible overlap with the the initial wavepacket , and is thus physically irrelevant for computing the distribution .",
    "another problematic matter is the interpretation of the discrete nature of the time of arrival eigenvalues in the box .",
    "a discretization of time variables should not be surprising . for any system with discrete energies or",
    "eigenmodes the corresponding time periods are also discrete . in the same vein , the toa operator considered",
    "involves the discretized momentum operator in the denominator and therefore discrete eigenvalues .",
    "the problem thus is not in accepting the possibility of a discretization but in determining its operational meaning .",
    "`` measurements '' , and `` observables '' are frequently highly idealized in quantum mechanics , to the point that all explicit reference to an apparatus could disappear .",
    "this is useful , but may also let us without important physical references for its operational interpretation .",
    "whereas an operational interpretation exists for kijowski distribution in the continuum , a direct operational interpretation of the discrete times of the confined case is still missing and is one of the challenges for future research . in any case",
    ", the discrete - continuum smooth transition found here may be a useful tool to generate new theories of , say , first time - of - arrival with interacting potentials , that can be later translated to the continuum and operationally interpreted or compared with existing operational proposals @xcite .",
