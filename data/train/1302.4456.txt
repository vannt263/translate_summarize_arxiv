    "shell_. it is shown by @xcite that in both wind and shell models when outflows with _ finite _ duration are considered some important aspects of the optical depth behaviour are overlooked .",
    "there a new physically motivated classification was introduced :  photon thick and photon thin outflows with respectively @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the photospheric radius , @xmath3 the radius of transition , @xmath4 is the lorentz factor and @xmath5 the laboratory width of the outflow .",
    "light curves and spectra from finite outflows were obtained using two different approximations : sharp and fuzzy photosphere .",
    "these approximations were derived there from the transport equation for radiation .    in this work",
    "we examine the validity of these approximations using mc simulations of photon scattering .",
    "we compute the probability of last scattering in finite relativistic outflows .",
    "then we obtain light curves and spectra from both photon thick and photon thin outflows , and compare them with the results obtained before .",
    "following @xcite we consider a spherical wind of finite width @xmath5 with laboratory number density of electrons being zero everywhere except the region @xmath6 where it is    @xmath7    with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being respectively the radius and the density at the base of the outflow .",
    "this outflow expands with constant lorentz factor @xmath4 , so that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",

    "notice that when there is strong relative difference of lorentz factors within the outflow with @xmath12 a radial spreading phenomenon discussed in @xcite and @xcite occurs .",
    "the outflow width starts to increase linearly with @xmath13 at the radius @xmath14 it is clear from this formula that such phenomenon occurs at radii much larger than @xmath15 when @xmath16 . in what follows we consider such case only .",
    "our results are valid for arbitrary constant @xmath5 .",

    "time @xmath22 is found via the equations of motion of the outflow and that of the photon .",
    "the optical depth in finite relativistic outflows has two different asymptotic , depending on initial conditions : in photon thick case @xmath26 is almost constant within the outflow ; instead in the photon thin case it is linearly increasing with depth from the outer boundary at @xmath27 .    in @xcite diffusion of photons within the outflow",
    "is found to play a crucial role in photon thin case : the radius at which photons effectively diffuse out of the outflow is smaller than the photospheric radius @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is defined by equating expression ( [ tau ] ) to unity for emission with @xmath28 and @xmath22 corresponding to the inner boundary .",
    "hence , when the photon thin outflow reaches the photospheric radius there are few photons left in it .",

    ", we compute a maximal value for the optical depth @xmath32 using ( [ tau ] ) with @xmath33 .",
    "the probability for the photon to decouple the outflow is @xmath34 . then a random number @xmath35 $ ] is chosen . on the one hand , if @xmath36 the photon is considered decoupled .",
    "afterwards photon remains in the outflow but does not scatter .",
    "this case corresponds to decoupling in photon thick case , for which the presence of boundaries is not essential . on the other hand , if @xmath37 the position @xmath38 of next scattering",
    "is computed from the optical depth@xmath39\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the angle between photon momentum and the radius vector at the position of scattering .  the new radial position @xmath38 such that @xmath41   \\equiv x$ ] is found by iterations .",
    "the second step is to take into account the finite width of the outflow .",
    "to do so , @xmath38 is compared with the radii of the inner and outer boundaries of the outflow .",
    "if @xmath42 or @xmath43 the scattering does not take place and the photon is considered decoupled .",
    "such decoupling occurring at the boundaries corresponds to the photon thin case . in the opposite case @xmath44 the scattering is assumed to occur and the loop is repeated until the photon decouples .",
    "we consider two models of scattering : coherent isotropic scattering and compton scattering .",
    "the former is treated for comparison with results in the literature such as e.g. @xcite .",
    "such model is also interesting",
    "_ per se _ since it preserves planck spectrum and it traces only geometrical effects .",
    "instead when compton scattering is considered , the equilibrium spectrum is the wien one because stimulated emission is not taken into account by mc simulation . for initially large optical depth",
    "the spectrum indeed firstly acquires the wien shape , and only at the photosphere it changes the shape again .",
    "the coherent scattering is computed by lorentz transformation to the reference frame comoving with the outflow .",
    "in addition , when compton scattering is considered , another lorentz transformation to the rest frame of the electron is performed .",

    "the probability density is peaked at the boundaries .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     difference between photon thin and photon thick outflows is also reflected in the probability density of last scattering as a function of the radius , shown at the bottom of fig .",

    "let us stress how different the probability densities for photon thick and photon thin cases are .",
    "not only the positions of the maximum , but also the shapes are different . in photon thin case at small radii the number of photons that diffuse out is determined by the change in the diffusion coefficient , i.e. the electron density which follows a power law . in expanding plasma while the density decreases ,",
    "the mean free path for photons increases which makes the diffusion faster . at large radii",
    "almost all photons have already diffused out , and the probability has an exponential cut off . as for the photon thick case , the probability density dependence on the radius is opposite . for small radii",
    "the probability for last scattering is exponentially suppressed because of large optical depth , while at large radii it follows a power law , as discussed in @xcite . at larger radii",

    "the average comoving energy of photons for steady wind was considered by @xcite and @xcite . for finite outflow",
    "we show this quantity in fig .",
    "[ fig : energycom ] and compare it with the @xmath73 dependence characteristic of adiabatic cooling .",
    "the difference between compton and coherent scattering comes from the fact that the average energy in the optically thick regime is @xmath74 for wien spectrum and @xmath75 for planck spectrum . in agreement with previous studies",
    "we find that the average energy of photons at the photosphere is higher than adiabatic cooling predicts .",

    "[ fig : lc ] , where we defined @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 laboratory radius and time of emission .",

    "the results of mc simulation are in qualitative agreement with both approximations , slightly favouring the sharp photosphere one .             in photon thin case diffusion",
    "has been shown to be important .",
    "both light curve and spectrum are characterized by the radius of diffusion @xmath88 and the associated arrival time @xmath89 .",
    "it should be noted that the photospheric emission carries only a fraction of the total energy of a grb . in the photon thin case",
    "the duration of the photospheric emission is relatively short , see the formula above , which implies that the luminosity of this component can be comparable to the luminosity of the rest of the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "such short and intense photospheric emission preceding the main burst has been reported in many grbs @xcite .    since photons are still strongly coupled to the outflow , local thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "is maintained everywhere but at the very boundary .",
    "indeed , this part of the outflow looses photons by random walks . for mc simulations of the photon thin outflows we used the coherent scattering model .",
    "the results are compared with @xcite where light curve and spectrum are obtained using the sharp photosphere approximation , after solving radiative diffusion equation .",
    "it has been demonstrated there that the temperature at the boundary of the outflow follows a different law from the one of adiabatic cooling : @xmath90 with both temperatures nearly coinciding at the radius of diffusion .",
    "so we expect the time integrated spectrum obtained by mc simulations has more power at energies above the peak .    finally , in both mc simulations and the work of @xcite the photons emitted outside the relativistic beaming cone from the photon thin outflows are neglected .",
    "this is good approximation , since such photons have much lower energy due to the doppler effect . besides , their arrival time is @xmath91 longer than the arrival time of diffusion .",
    "spectra and light curves are shown respectively in figs .",
    "[ fig : specthincase ] and [ fig : lcthin ] .",
    "the simulation involves @xmath92 photons .",
    "we see a good agreement between both methods of computation .",
    "the high energy tail with a power law in the time integrated spectrum is clearly visible .",
    "our mc simulation shows the exponential cut off at the energy corresponding to the temperature of photons at the radius defined by the initial optical depth @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : specthincase ] ) .",
    "the power law above the peak energy should extend up to initial temperature @xmath93 , see @xcite .",
    "this also results in the missing initial part of the light - curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lcthin ] ) .",
    "the power law index is @xmath94 for the model of the outflow given by eq .",
    "( [ portionofwind ] ) . such power law is steeper than typical high energy power laws observed in grbs .",
    "it remains to be analyzed how @xmath95 changes for different hydrodynamic models of the outflow .",
    "besides , high energy gev emission can not be explained with this model since there exists an exponential cut off corresponding to the initial temperature in the source of grb , typically being in mev region",
    ".     is here the laboratory temperature at @xmath88 . ]",
    "to summarize , in this work we considered the photospheric emission from finite relativistic outflow by mc simulations of photon scattering .",
    "the validity of the assumptions made in @xcite is verified and it is found that the fuzzy photosphere approximation used in that paper is adequate in describing both the light curves and the shape of the spectra of photospheric emission from photon thick outflows .",
    "the sharp photosphere approximation produces qualitatively acceptable results for photon thick outflows , but underestimates high energy part of the spectrum and the decaying part of the light curve .",
    "as expected , diffusion is found to dominate the photospheric emission of photon thin outflows .",
    "the probability density of last scattering is obtained in this case both as function of outflow depth and its radial position .",
