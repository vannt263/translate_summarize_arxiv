    "the good time intervals were generated by applying a filter expression of `` ( data_qual@xmath131 ) & & ( lat_config@xmath131 ) & & abs(rock_angle)@xmath14 52 '' to the data .    throughout this analysis , version v9r32p5 of the _ fermi science tools _ was used in conjunction with the p7rep_clean_v15 instrument response functions ( irfs ) . during the analysis , a model file consisting of both point and diffuse sources of @xmath1-rays was utilised . in particular , the model file consisted of the most recent galactic , gll_iem_v05.fit , and extragalactic , iso_clean_v05.txt , diffuse models , and all @xmath1-ray point sources within a 6@xmath2 roi centered on rbs 0970 .",

    "an indepth analysis of the @xmath5 gev flux from rbs 0970 during a 28 day window centered on the detection of the vhe photons revealed that the emission of the 114 and 117 gev photons coincided with a hardening of the @xmath1-ray spectrum when compared to the 5.3 year average .",
    "however , the same analysis did not find any significant @xmath1-ray emission from rbs 0970 during the emission of the 273 gev event .",
    "this non - detection is hard to accommodate in a pure ssc model description of @xmath1-ray emission from rbs 0970 .",
