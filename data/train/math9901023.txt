    "in the present paper we consider local differential geometry of a holomorphic curve @xmath0 in the complex grassmann manifold @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the simplest way to study such a curve is to consider a holomorphic local lift @xmath2 of @xmath0 to the space @xmath3 of complex @xmath4 matrices , defined on some open subset @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",
    "the natural object arising here is the so called frenet frame being a mapping which associates a basis of @xmath7 with a point of @xmath5 .",
    "we give a procedure of the construction of the frenet frame and derive the equations which are satisfied by the corresponding @xmath7-valued functions on @xmath6 .",
    "then we show that the obtained equations are closely connected to nonabelian toda systems based on the lie group @xmath8 .",
    "the equations describing these systems are exactly integrable , so we get a possibility to construct holomorphic embeddings with prescribed properties . note that our definition of the frenet frame is different from the definition usually used for the problem under consideration , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "namely , we do not perform the complete orthogonalisation of the basis , and it is our definition that leads to an exactly integrable system .",
    "the paper is concluded with the explanation of how the frenet frame can be used to construct a local moving frame associated with the mapping @xmath0 and with the calculation of the corresponding connection coefficients .",
    "there is a lot of papers discussing geometry of harmonic mappings of a riemann surface into a projective space , see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "since any holomorphic mapping from one khler manifold to another one is harmonic , most results of those paper are valid for holomorphic mappings .",
    "there are also some papers devoted to consideration of harmonic mappings from riemann surfaces to grassmann manifolds @xcite . in these papers the problems of classification and construction of harmonic mappings are mainly investigated . on the other hand , local differential geometry properties of holomorphic mappings from riemann surfaces to grassmann manifolds",
    "have not yet been discussed in a systematic way . in this respect",
    "we would like to mention the paper @xcite which deals with differential geometry of holomorphic mappings from the two - sphere to a grassmann manifold .",
    "note that the connection of abelian toda systems based on the lie group @xmath9 with the equations satisfied by the frenet frame associated with an immersion of a riemann surface into a projective space appeared to be useful for the study of @xmath10-geometries @xcite .",
    "moreover , this connection allows to give a simple proof of the infinitesimal plcker relations .",
    "the abelian toda systems based on other semisimple lie groups can be associated with equations satisfied by the frenet frames of holomorphic curves in the corresponding flag manifolds .",
    "this leads to the so - called generalised infinitesimal plcker relations @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper show that there are some relations between the geometric characteristics of the holomorphic curves associated with a holomorphic curve in a grassmann manifold , but here we have no direct analogues of the plcker relations .",
    "this problem requires an additional consideration .",
    "it is also very interesting to investigate the corresponding @xmath10-geometries .",
    "we start with the description of the realisation of complex grassmann manifolds which is convenient for our purposes .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the complex manifold of @xmath11 complex matrices .",
    "assume that @xmath12 and denote by @xmath13 the open submanifold of @xmath3 formed by @xmath14 matrices of rank @xmath15 .",
    "the manifold @xmath13 could be naturally identified with the set of all bases of @xmath15-dimensional subspaces of @xmath7 .",
    "two points @xmath16 correspond to bases of the same subspace of @xmath7 if and only if there is an element @xmath17 of the complex general linear group @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "thus we have the free right action of the complex lie group @xmath18 on @xmath13 connecting different bases of the @xmath15-dimensional subspaces of @xmath7 .",
    "the orbit space here is the grassmann manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the canonical projection @xmath20 is holomorphic and @xmath21 is a holomorphic principal @xmath22-bundle .",
    "consider a holomorphic curve @xmath23 , where @xmath6 is some connected riemann surface .",
    "any such a curve defines a holomorphic subbundle @xmath24 of rank @xmath15 of the trivial holomorphic fibre bundle @xmath25 . here",
    "the fiber over the point @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "the mapping @xmath0 is said to be _ linearly full _ if the bundle @xmath24 is not contained in any proper trivial subbundle of @xmath28 .    to describe geometry of the corresponding holomorphic curve in @xmath1",
    "it is convenient to use local holomorphic lifts of the mapping @xmath0 to @xmath29 .",
    "we say that a holomorphic mapping @xmath30 , where @xmath5 is an open subset of @xmath6 , is a local holomorphic lift of @xmath0 if it satisfies the relation @xmath31 since our consideration is local , we will use local holomorphic lifts defined in coordinate neighbourhoods of @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding local coordinate will be denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , to make our notations consistent with those used in description of toda systems , we denote @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35    let @xmath30 be a lift of a holomorphic mapping @xmath36",

    "since the first and higher order derivatives of the functions @xmath51 , @xmath38 , @xmath52 over @xmath32 can be also expanded at @xmath49 in the power series which absolutely converge in @xmath53 , it is clear that for any @xmath54 one has @xmath55 . from the other hand ,",

    "considering various local lifts of @xmath0 we conclude that for any point @xmath63 there is an open neighbourhood @xmath64 such that @xmath62 for all @xmath65 . now",
    "the assertion of the proposition follows from the connectedness of @xmath6 .",
    "thus we have some constant subspace @xmath10 of @xmath7 which characterises the curve @xmath0 .",
    "the mapping @xmath0 can be considered as a mapping from @xmath6 to @xmath66 , in this case it can be easily shown that @xmath0 is linearly full . therefore , without any loss of generality we can restrict ourselves to the consideration of linearly full mappings .      in this section @xmath67 is an @xmath68-dimensional complex vector space and @xmath5 is an open connected subset of the complex plane @xmath69 .",
