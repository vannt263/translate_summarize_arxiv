    "it has been known for years that the observed energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays can be well described by an inverse power law in the energy @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ev @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the flux in @xmath18 .",
    "however , the index @xmath19 reveals an abrupt change at around @xmath20 ev@xmath21 ev@xmath22 pev : @xmath23 this sudden change in the slope of cosmic ray spectrum ( crs ) is usually called the  knee \" .",
    "it seems that there is a second knee at around @xmath1 ev@xmath24 ev , then follows the  ankle \" at around @xmath25 ev , at which the slope changes from @xmath26 to 2.78 @xcite .    among various tentative explanations for the knee in crs ,",
    "the model initiated by kostelecky first @xcite and then elaborated by ehrlich @xcite is the most attractive one .",
    "their basic idea is as follows :    corresponding to the decay of a neutron @xmath27 the  proton decay \" @xmath28 is considered . for the decay to conserve energy in the proton rest frame [ to be referred as the @xmath29 frame in which an observer bob ( b ) is present ] , @xmath30 is needed . then the threshold laboratory [ defined by the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , to be referred as the @xmath31 frame in which another observer alice ( a ) is present ] energy for proton was derived as ( @xmath32 ) @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the tachyon mass of neutrino .",
    "if setting @xmath13 to be the energy of knee @xmath35 ev , they found @xmath36 ev/@xmath9 .",
    "the idea of how a  stable \" proton can decay was explained by the so - called  reinterpretation principle \" @xcite .",
    "the emitted @xmath3 with @xmath37 in the process  ( [ eq:4 ] ) in the @xmath31 frame could be identified with the process @xmath38 with an absorbed @xmath3 with @xmath39 from a background sea in the @xmath29 frame .",
    "furthermore , the cosmic ray nucleons on their way to earth would lose their energy through the chain of decays @xmath40 , which not only depletes the spectrum at energies above @xmath6 @xcite and may also account for the existence of the  ankle \" and a neutron  spike \" just above @xmath6 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the reason why the gzk cutoff ( cosmic rays with energies much above @xmath41 ev were predicted to not reach earth from distant sources because of their interaction with photons comprising the cbr ) is absent ( as shown in @xcite ) is because neutrons have a much smaller interaction with the cbr .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to further justify the above model by refining the theory of tachyon ( superluminal particle , i.e. , faster - than - light particle ) for neutrinos .",
    "we will take both energy and momentum conservation laws into account to rigorously derive the relation between @xmath6 and the tachyon mass m ( real and positive ) of neutrinos .",
    "if setting @xmath42 ev , we will find the value of @xmath43 for @xmath3 being 0.54 ev/@xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we consider a similar process in the @xmath29 frame to create the neutral hyperon @xmath44 ( with quark content @xmath45 ) and a muon : @xmath46 fitting the energy at the second knee @xmath47 ev , we find the tachyon mass of @xmath7 around 0.48 ev/@xmath9",
    ". the implications of our theory will be discussed below .",
    "the reason why many physicists do not believe in tachyons goes back to a strange puzzle involving tachyon motion .",

    "bob takes another @xmath29 frame moving relative to @xmath31 with velocity @xmath52",
    ". then if @xmath53 , the time coordinate of p in the @xmath29 frame will become negative : @xmath54 which was regarded as the  tachyon traveling backward in time \" or  a violation of causality \" @xcite .",

    ", the above puzzle can be better displayed in an alternative way . from the well known lorentz transformation ( lt )",
    ", we have the addition law for velocities as : @xmath58 where @xmath55 is the velocity of tachyon in the @xmath29 frame . as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] @xcite , there is a pole at @xmath59 . for a fixed @xmath56 , when @xmath52 increases across the singularity @xmath60",
    ", bob will see that @xmath55 leaps abruptly from @xmath61 : @xmath62 however , eq .  ( [ eq:10 ] ) still remains as a puzzle .",
    "according to lt , the momentum @xmath63 and energy @xmath64 of tachyon in the @xmath29 frame are related to @xmath65 and @xmath13 in the @xmath31 frame as follows : @xmath66 with @xmath67 here @xmath43 is the tachyon mass of a particle with kinematical relation as ; @xmath68 combining ( [ eq:10 ] ) with ( [ eq:11 ] ) leads to : @xmath69 now the puzzle arises : how can a particle have @xmath70 whereas its @xmath71 ?",
    "how can it have energy @xmath72 whereas @xmath73 ?",
    "all of the above puzzles from ( [ eq:8])-([eq:14 ] ) comprise the  superluminal paradox \" .",
    "the paradox disappears in a reasonable quantum theory ( developed from the  reinterpretation principle \" ) as follows : according to bob s point of view , the tachyon behaves in the @xmath29 frame ( with @xmath53 ) just like an antitachyon moving at a velocity @xmath55 .",
    "so its momentum and energy should be measured as : @xmath74 this is because the well known operators in quantum mechanics : @xmath75 are valid only for a particle . for its antiparticle , we should use instead : @xmath76 ( where the subscript @xmath77 refers to an antiparticle ) which are just the essence of special relativity ( sr)@xcite .",
    "note that , however , the distinction between ( [ eq:16 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) is merely relative , not absolute .",
    "for example , the energy of positron @xmath78 ( which is the antiparticle of electron ) in the process ( [ eq:6 ] ) is always positive like that of neutron @xmath79 .",
    "but once a neutrino has energy @xmath73 in the @xmath31 frame [ see ( [ eq:18 ] ) below ] but has @xmath72 in the @xmath29 frame , it behaves just like an antineutrino in the @xmath29 frame .",
    "then the relations ( [ eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) must be taken into account when dealing with the lt .",
    "for further discussion , see the appendix .",
    "according to the present knowledge of particle physics , a free proton is stable in the vacuum .",
    "it will never decay no matter how high its energy is ( principle of relativity ) .",
    "however , according to the theory of modern cosmology , low energy neutrinos including all three flavors ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) and antineutrinos ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) are spreading through out space isotropically .",
    "( there may also be considerable amount of high energy neutrinos directly related to observable distant sources ) .",
    "so the process ( [ eq:6 ] ) could be induced for either the subluminal or superluminal antineutrino if the proton has enough energy but still well below @xmath84 ev , no knee will be seen . hence , to explain the appearance of a knee , which implies a sudden opening of a reaction channel , a new mechanism of tachyonic neutrinos must be considered .",
    "now let us consider a process : @xmath85 which is strictly forbidden at energy @xmath86 due to the different lepton quantum numbers on opposing sides .",
    "however , once the proton velocity @xmath52 exceeds a critical value to be calculated below , a low energy neutrino @xmath3 ( with @xmath87 in the @xmath31 frame ) suddenly transforms into an antineutrino with sufficiently high energy @xmath88 in the @xmath29 frame as discussed in the previous section .",
    "then the process ( [ eq:6 ] ) suddenly occurs as an exotic realization of ( [ eq:18 ] ) in the s frame and contributes to the abrupt change of the slope in crs as shown in ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "denoting the rest masses ( and velocities in the @xmath29 frame ) of protons , neutrons and positrons by @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) respectively , bob can write down the conservation laws of energy and momentum in the @xmath29 frame as follows : @xmath95 @xmath96 where the antineutrino velocity @xmath55 is given by ( [ eq:9 ] ) with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "any one of these velocities can take either positive [ along the @xmath99 axis ] or negative [ along the @xmath100 axis ] value automatically .",

    "as shown in the particle table published in 2000 @xcite , the mass square of electron neutrino defined by @xmath130 seems negative in tritium beta decay : @xmath131 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "due to difficulties in experiments and theoretical analysis @xcite , physicists often think the present data is not accurate enough to fix the value of @xmath132 .",
    "however , the first reason why its uncertainty is so large lies in the fact that a neutrino is oscillating among three flavors as verified by the kamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite experimental groups .",
    "the oscillation implies that neutrinos are staying ( at least ) in two mass eigenstates .",
    "for instance , in a minimal three - flavor model for tachyonic neutrino @xcite , an equation containing only one parameter @xmath11 is proposed ( @xmath133 ) : @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the left - handed and right - handed chiral states of flavor @xmath103 for a neutrino ( @xmath137 are pauli matrices ) .",
    "the neutrino is oscillating among three mass eigenstates of energy square being : @xmath138 @xmath139 in this model , however , different flavors all have the same mass .",
    "the fitting values of @xmath3 and @xmath7 from ( [ eq:33 ] ) and ( [ eq:35 ] ) seem to favor the predictions above .",
    "and the large uncertainty in ( [ eq:37 ] ) is primarily due to the existence of oscillation between two mass eigenvalues : @xmath140 as discussed in @xcite , the expectation value of mass square of @xmath3 just created from beta decay should be : @xmath141 in comparison with ( [ eq:37 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the two knees in crs should be fitted by one expectation value of tachyon mass for a neutrino in flight : @xmath142 comparing it with the average of ( [ eq:33 ] ) and ( [ eq:35 ] ) , 0.51 ev/@xmath9 , we find the value of @xmath11 being approximately : @xmath143    however , we suggest that if experimental physicists can treat their data in a two - center fitting as shown by ( [ eq:40 ] ) or ( [ eq:41 ] ) in @xmath144 or @xmath145 ratio ( with statistical weight ratio @xmath146 or @xmath147 ) for the case of ( [ eq:42 ] ) or ( [ eq:43 ] ) respectively , better results could be obtained .",
    "\\(a ) following kostelecky and ehrlich , we elaborate a model of tachyonic neutrinos to explain two knees in the crs by two eqs .",
    "( [ eq:32 ] ) and ( [ eq:34 ] ) respectively with one tachyon mass of neutrino ( @xmath3 or @xmath7 ) being estimated to be around 0.51 ev/@xmath9 regardless of the flavor .",
    "this result favors a minimal three - flavor model for tachyonic neutrinos containing only one coupling parameter @xmath12 ev .",
    "\\(b ) the tachyon theory for neutrinos is a natural extension of the theory of special relativity ( sr ) in combination with the theory of quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "especially , the basic operator relations ( [ eq:16 ] ) for particles should be supplemented by ( [ eq:17 ] ) for antiparticles while the addition law for velocities in sr , eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) , remains valid for both subluminal and superluminal motions .",
    "\\(c ) we dare not discuss the explanation of the ankle in crs before further calculation could be made in detail which might be related to the distribution of distant sources for both cosmic rays and neutrinos",
    ". however , one thing can supplement the interpretation of the evasion of gzk cutoff @xcite . in the long chain of decays : @xmath40 ( or @xmath148 ) , the lifetime of @xmath79 ( or @xmath44 ) may be different for different polarizations : while the right - handed @xmath79 ( @xmath44 ) has lifetime @xmath149 , the left - handed one has @xmath150 @xcite : @xmath151 where @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "the faster the speed @xmath52 of @xmath79 ( @xmath44 ) is , the larger @xmath149 will be .",
    "therefore , we expect that most nucleons ( fermions ) in the cosmic ray should be right - handed polarized .",
    "future experiments will pose a serious test on the mechanism of the knees , ankle and the evasion of gzk cutoff as well as the prediction of ( [ eq:45])a phenomenon of parity violation in the beta decay .",
    "\\(d ) a particle is always impure in the sense of having two contradictory fields , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "they obey the basic symmetry of space - time inversion ( @xmath156 ) : @xmath157 the neutrino is no exception to this rule . indeed , eq .  ( [ eq:38 ] ) with relations : @xmath158 remains invariant under the transformation ( [ eq:46 ] ) with subscripts added .",
    "however , uniquely , neutrinos have another two symmetries : eq .",
    "( [ eq:38 ] ) is also invariant under the pure time inversion ( @xmath159 ) : @xmath160 this is why bob will see a neutrino ( in the @xmath31 frame ) transforming into an antineutrino in the @xmath29 frame . on the other hand , the left - right symmetry ( parity )",
    "is violated to maximum , since eq .",
    "( [ eq:38 ] ) is no longer invariant under the pure space inversion ( @xmath161 ) : @xmath162 in contrast to the case of the dirac equation .",
    "interestingly enough , a massive neutrino ( antineutrino ) can preserve its permanent left - handed ( right - handed ) polarization because its velocity @xmath56 exceeds the speed of light @xmath77 .",
    "\\(e ) the mass @xmath43 and energy @xmath13 of every particle or antiparticle ( regardless of it being a tachyon or not ) is real and positive in the strict sense that they are measured in certain experiments .",
    "however , for a theory capable of treating the particle and antiparticle on an equal footing , it must be invariant under symmetry transformation : @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "hence , from the theoretical point of view , by using eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) only , we may say that the antiparticle state is the negative - energy state of a particle , e.g. , the wavefunction ( [ eq : a12 ] ) versus ( [ eq : a11 ] ) in the appendix .",
    "there is an interesting question relevant to the theory of cosmology : where the enormous energy of our universe ( comprising mainly of matter ) comes from ?",
    "in other words , is the energy conserved in the bigbang ?",
    "we try to answer the above question by assuming that during the bigbang , equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created simultaneously @xcite .",
    "hence , in some sense , we may regard the entire universe really as an ultimate free lunch @xcite .",
    "i am greatly indebted to p. t. leung for bringing ref .",
    "[ 7 ] to my attention .",
    "i also thank s. q. chen and z. q. shi for helpful discussions .",
    "bob never observed in the @xmath29 frame a neutrino moving backward in time ( because  time \" is a conception endowed by the observer , not by the particle ) but an antineutrino flying toward him with high energy @xmath164 and momentum @xmath165 .",

    "both a and b believe in the lt for linking the quantities they measured .",
    "thus a and b come to agree that the minus sign before the @xmath172 and @xmath173 is due to the fact that the same particle exhibits itself as a neutrino in the @xmath31 frame whereas it must appear as an antineutrino in the @xmath29 frame before it can be absorbed by the proton .",
    "if instead of ( [ eq : a7 ] ) and ( [ eq : a8 ] ) , alice insists on writing conservation laws in the @xmath31 frame as usual : @xmath174 then after measurements and calculation , alice has to admit that both @xmath172 and @xmath173 here turn to negative values as shown by ( [ eq : a7 ] ) and ( [ eq : a8 ] ) .",
    "when doing so , alice is tacitly assuming that before the neutrino interacts with the proton , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are already existing .",
    "hence she is worried that the energy ( momentum ) conservation law seems to be violated in the process ( [ eq:18 ] ) .",
    "the above discussion reminds us of a remarkable experiment on squid @xcite , showing a macroscopic schrdinger s cat puzzle  in a superconducting ring carrying clockwise current , the  hidden \" anticlockwise current was measured by the absorption of microwave radiation .",
    "( for its discussion , see @xcite , also @xcite ) .",
