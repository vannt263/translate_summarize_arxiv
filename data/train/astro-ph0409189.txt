    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and the milky way show that these type of galaxies have dark halo component .",
    "the most trivial candidate for the dark halo structure is the baryonic matter that can be in the form of gaseous or massive compact halo objects ( machos ) .",
    "since machos are expected to be too light to be luminous and difficult detectable , @xcite proposed an indirect method so - called gravitational microlensing to observe them indirectly .",
    "following his suggestion several experiments such as eros and macho started monitoring millions of lmc stars for one decade and observed less than 20 events in this direction ( @xcite ) . due to the degeneracy nature of gravitational microlensing problem , it is impossible to obtain the mass , distance and transverse velocity of the lenses by measuring the duration of events . the only way is using statistical studies , comparing the microlensing events with the models .",
    "the outcome of this study is the mean mass of machos and their mass contribution in the galactic halo . for the standard galactic model with the dirac - delta mass function ( mf ) ,",
    "halo is comprised by @xmath5 of machos with the mass of @xmath6 . comparing the luminous mass of milky way with that of halo",
    ", we can conclude that the white dwarfs of halo should have twice mass of the ordinary stars of the disk and bulge . + ke proposed using dirac delta spatially varying mf as a solution to this problem but it has been shown that the duration distribution in this model is not compatible with the lmc microlensing candidates .",
    "rahvar ( 2004a ) used a likelihood analysis to find the best parameters for the model . here",
    "we use more realistic mf for the machos of halo as the power law function where the mass scale and the index of mf changes monotonically from the center to the edge of galaxy .",

    "the effective mean mass of lenses , as the mean mass of observed lenses in this model is larger than the mean mass of overall lenses of the galactic halo .",
    "this means that the galactic halo with the dominant brown dwarfs can produce microlensing events compatible with the observed data .",
    "+ the organization of paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce the hypothesis of spatially varying mf of ke and power - law models . in section 3",
    "we compare the lmc microlensing events of macho experiment with the expected distribution from the model and section 4 contains the conclusion of this work .",
    "the tradition in the microlensing analysis is using dirac - delta mf for the machos of galactic halo .",
    "this function has been used for the sake of simplicity to apply it to an arbitrary mf of halo .",
    "however this approach hides the information about the contribution of the machos with various masses in the gravitational microlensing candidates .",
    "+ star and baryonic cluster formation theories ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) predict the variation of mf in interstellar medium depending on the density of clouds forming the stars . @xcite and @xcite also showed that instead of universal initial mass function we can have a composite with various contributions from the brown dwarfs , solar masses and high mass stars , depending on the density of environment . since the halo density changes as @xmath7 , we can conclude that the mf of machos may change by distance from the center of galaxy .",
    "the inner halo comprises partly visible stars , in association with the globular cluster population , while the outer halo comprises mostly low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "+ the hypothesis of using spatially varying mf has been proposed by ke .",

    "+ here we use more realistic spatially varying mf than the ke model .",
    "the mf of stars is taken as the power low function @xmath14 , where the index of function depends on the mass scale of stars .",
    "the upper limit of index @xcite for the substellar regime can be @xmath4 and the lower limit @xcite of @xmath2 for the stars massive than the solar mass .",

    "here in this section our aim is to compare the microlensing data with the theoretical model .",
    "first we calculate the theoretical and experimental optical depths ( @xcite ) and compare them with each others . using the experimental efficiency of observation ,",
    "the observed optical depth obtain as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the duration of ith event and @xmath28 is the exposure time of observation which for the 5.7 yrs observation of lmc by macho experiment , @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "the optical depth results from 13 lmc microlensing candidates is about @xmath30 .",
    "one the other hand , using the power - law mf for the machos of galactic halo in the standard halo model , we can produce the rate of microlensing events @xmath31 .",

    "the lenses are selected by the probability function as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the matter density and @xmath38 is the lens - source to the observer - source distances . after selecting the position of lenses , we use the equation ( [ pwlmf ] ) to obtain their masses .",

    "in contrast to the active mean mass we define passive mean mass of lenses as the mean mass of overall lenses in the halo .",
    "the active and passive mean masses of lenses in this model are obtained as the @xmath42 and @xmath43 solar masses .",
