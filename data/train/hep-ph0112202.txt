    "the generation of particle masses in the standard model ( sm ) is accomplished through the well known higgs mechanism . in its minimal version ,",
    "i.e. , with one scalar doublet , there is only one free parameter in the scalar sector , the higgs mass , @xmath2 .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking the two parameters in the scalar potential are replaced by the vacuum expectation value @xmath3 and by @xmath2 , which remains unconstrained . introducing another scalar doublet of complex fields makes the number of free parameters in the potential grow from two to fourteen .",
    "the number of scalar particles grows from one to four .",
    "if explicit cp violation is not allowed , the number of free parameters is reduced to ten .",
    "this number can be further reduced to seven by imposing either a global u(1 ) symmetry or a @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "we call the resulting potentials , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . some of the vertices in the scalar sectors of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are different and this gives rise to differences in the amplitudes for physical processes .",
    "this fact has often been overlooked in the literature .    adding or subtracting mass terms to either of these potentials",
    "does not spoil the renormalizability of the model . in the first case",
    "it is well known that a softly broken theory remains renormalizable ( see for instance @xcite ) . in the second case",
    "the renormalization will introduce a counterterm with the same structure of the suppressed term .",
    "again these are mass terms which are simply absorbed in the mass renormalization of the four scalar bosons .",
    "hence , we have analysed all possible cp - conserving and renormalizable models obtained by addition or subtraction of all available mass terms to @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in some cases the resulting potentials have only six or even five free parameters . in paragraph ii we discuss the potential .",
    "then , to illustrate that they lead to different physical results we calculate in paragraph iii the one - loop correction to the top quark decay @xmath0 and in paragraph iv the decay @xmath1 in the fermiophobic limit .",
    "to define our notation , we start with a brief review of the two - higgs doublet models ( thdm ) . let @xmath7 with @xmath8 denote two complex scalar doublets with hyper - charge 1 . under @xmath9",
    "the fields transform as @xmath10 where the parameters @xmath11 are arbitrary . defining the complete set of invariants @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 and choosing @xmath16",
    "we can write the most general @xmath17 invariant , @xmath9 invariant and renormalizable potential in the form @xmath18 in a previous paper@xcite we have studied the different types of extrema for potential @xmath19 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that there are two natural ways of imposing that a minimum with @xmath20 violation never occurs , i.e. , that the minimum of the potential is of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 real .",
    "the first one , denoted @xmath5 , is obtained by setting @xmath23 in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this is the potential in ref .",
    "it is invariant under the @xmath4 transformation @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the second 7-parameter potential , denoted by @xmath6 , is the potential obtained in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) and it corresponds to the conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "potential @xmath6 is invariant under a global @xmath28 symmetry @xmath29 except for the soft breaking term proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "let us examine how the theory behaves by adding or subtracting all possible mass terms to the potential .",
    "we start by writing the potential in the form @xmath31 which allow us to study both potentials @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the same time .",
    "the minimum conditions are    @xmath32 - \\frac{1}{2 } \\mu_3 ^ 2 v_2 = 0 \\\\    & t_2 = & v_2 \\left[-\\mu_2 ^ 2 + \\lambda_2 v_2 ^ 2 + \\lambda_{+ } v_1 ^ 2       \\right ] - \\frac{1}{2 } \\mu_3 ^ 2 v_1 = 0 \\\\   & t_3 = &   \\mu_4 ^ 2 v_2 = 0 \\\\   & t_4 = &   - \\mu_4 ^ 2 v_1 = 0 \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath33 .",
    "obviously , conditions ( 4c , d ) force @xmath34 because the vacuum configuration chosen in eq . ( 2 ) implies a stable , cp - conserving minima . since the @xmath35 term allows mixing between all neutral fields , its existence would only be possible in a theory with spontaneous cp violation .",
    "each complex doublet @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37\\ ] ] where @xmath38 are complex fields , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real fields .",

    "the scalars acquire a mass as a result of radiative corrections .",
    "hence , we end up with a renormalizable model where all scalars have a definite mass which is related to the gauge bosons masses . if @xmath63 one obtains a seven parameter potential where all vertices are given in terms of the physical masses and the angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "the electroweak corrections to the decay @xmath111 of order @xmath112 were evaluated in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the renormalization of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix was done in such a way that the final result was gauge dependent @xcite . recently , using a renormalization prescription introduced before @xcite , we have evaluated this decay width @xcite in the sm . a similar calculation in the thdm",

    "2 we plot @xmath119 for type b models . in most cases values of @xmath119 of the order of @xmath126 are obtained , but one does not need to go to an extreme corner of the parametric space to obtain even larger values .",
    "the curves for models @xmath127 are not plotted in the entire range of @xmath64 .",
    "this is due to two reasons .",
    "some values of @xmath64 are excluded by eqs .",
    "( 15 ) while others are excluded by our @xmath128 criteria .",
    "one should notice that for the top decay there are no contributions due to the cubic scalar vertices .",
    "this means that , for this process , @xmath5 and @xmath6 give exactly the same results .",
    "hence , the differences illustrated in figs . 1 and 2 are entirely due to the restrictions induced by eqs .",

    "in the so - called fermiophobic limit @xcite , the lightest higgs decouples from the fermions at tree level . this",
