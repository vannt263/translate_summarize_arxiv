    "most pulsars are thought to descend from massive stars in the disk of the galaxy , and as a result , the bulk of pulsar search efforts have historically been concentrated near the galactic plane where the majority of pulsars , with their fairly short observable lifetimes , reside ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early surveys along the plane met with limited success when searching for recycled pulsars . the value of finding new recycled pulsars comes from their contribution to our understanding of the binary evolution processes @xcite , tests of general relativity @xcite , and their use in a millisecond pulsar ( msp ) timing array for the detection of low frequency gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the pioneering survey of @xcite led to the discovery of two fascinating systems in a small area at high galactic latitude .",
    "this success spawned several surveys at high galactic latitudes , which yielded a large number of recycled pulsars @xcite .",
    "simulations of the low - luminosity galactic recycled pulsar population point to a more isotropic distribution than is expected for the more luminous long - period pulsars that are less subject to the deleterious effects of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "this difference is because recycled pulsars have had a longer time to migrate away from their birthplace in the galactic disk and their shorter periods strongly limit the distance to which they can be detected in the electron - rich galactic plane .",
    "these facts , combined with the relative insensitivity to dispersion and lower sky temperatures afforded by high - frequency observations , suggested that a 21 cm survey for pulsars away from the galactic plane would be extremely productive @xcite .",
    "the success of the swinburne intermediate latitude pulsar survey demonstrated the validity of this approach , discovering eight recycled pulsars in @xmath6deg@xmath0 at galactic latitudes between 5@xmath7 and 15@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recent re - processing of the parkes multibeam survey which concentrated on the galactic plane ( @xmath8 ) has also yielded millisecond and recycled pulsars in large numbers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe five recycled pulsars discovered in this extension of the swinburne intermediate latitude survey . in section [ sec : survey ] we describe the survey parameters before discussing the five pulsars individually in section 3 , giving their timing solutions ( where possible ) , pulse profiles and derived parameters . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "this survey was carried out using the 13-beam multibeam receiver on the parkes 64 m radio telescope from january 2001 to december 2002 .",
    "this survey covered @xmath9deg@xmath0 in the region @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "relatively short 265  s integrations gave a sensitivity which is well - matched to the expected scale height and luminosity distribution of the pulsar population @xcite and allowed us to complete the 7232 survey pointings in about four weeks of observing .",
    "the signals from each beam were processed and digitized by a @xmath12mhz filterbank operating at a center sky frequency of 1374mhz and one - bit sampled every 125@xmath13s , providing good sensitivity to fast pulsars with low to moderate dispersion measures .",
    "this observing methodology is identical to that employed for the swinburne intermediate latitude pulsar survey and differs from that of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite only in sampling period ( 125@xmath13s vs. 250@xmath13s ) and integration time ( 265s vs. 2100s ) .",
    "the resulting 2.4  tb of data were searched for pulsar - like signals using standard techniques with the 64 compaq alpha workstations at the swinburne centre for astrophysics and supercomputing , resulting in the discovery of 26 new pulsars .",
    "full details of this survey will be described in a future paper ( jacoby et al . in preparation ) . of these 26 new pulsars , seven are recycled .",
    "one of them , psr  j1909@xmath23744 , is an exceptionally interesting millisecond pulsar and has been reported elsewhere @xcite , and another , psr  j1738 + 0333 , will be described in a latter paper ( jacoby et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the other five are described here .",
    "these five objects belong to the class of recycled pulsars with relatively weak magnetic fields and small spindown rates .",
    "four are msps with spin periods well under 10ms ; the fifth has a longer spin period , but is still clearly recycled due to its large characteristic age ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "one of the msps is isolated ; the other pulsars are in binary systems with probable white dwarf companions .",
    "average pulse profiles of the five pulsars are shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "we have begun a systematic timing program at parkes for these and other pulsars discovered in this survey , primarily using the @xmath15mhz filterbank at 1390mhz with occasional observations using the @xmath16mhz filterbank at 660mhz to determine the dispersion measure ( dm ) .",
    "we followed standard pulsar timing procedures : folded pulse profiles from individual observations were cross - correlated with a high signal - to - noise template profile to determine an average pulse time of arrival ( toa ) corrected to utc(nist ) .",
    "the standard pulsar timing package tempo , along with the jet propulsion laboratory s de405 ephemeris , was used for all timing analysis .",
    "toa uncertainties for each pulsar were multiplied by a factor between 1.12 and 1.65 to achieve reduced @xmath17 .",
    "one of the new pulsars , psr  j1933@xmath26211 , has a very small orbital eccentricity ( @xmath18 ) , giving rise to a strong covariance between the time of periastron ( @xmath19 ) and longitude of periastron ( @xmath20 ) in this system . for this pulsar",
    ", we have used the ell1 binary model which replaces @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and @xmath18 with the time of ascending node ( @xmath21 ) and the laplace - lagrange parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we have used the dd model @xcite for psr  j1528@xmath23146 and psr  j1600@xmath23053 .    for psr  j1741 + 1351 ,",
    "orbital parameters were obtained by fitting a model to observed spin periods obtained from multiple observations with the 96-channel survey filterbank .",
    "the position reported here is the center of the survey beam in which the pulsar was discovered ; timing analysis of this pulsar is ongoing and will be reported in a future paper ( freire et al . in preparation ) .",
    "astrometric , spin , binary , and derived parameters for all pulsars are given in tables [ tab : par1 ] and [ tab : par2 ] .",
    "timing residuals for the four pulsars with timing solutions are shown in figure [ fig : residuals ] .",
    "psr j1528@xmath23146 has the longest spin period ( @xmath24ms ) of the five new pulsars reported here .",
    "the minimum companion mass ( obtained from the mass function by assuming an edge - on orbit and a pulsar mass of 1.35m@xmath25 ) is 0.94m@xmath25 ; the system s circular orbit suggests that the companion must be a co or onemg white dwarf .",
    "only a handful of such intermediate mass binary pulsar ( imbp ) systems are known @xcite . of all low - eccentricity binary pulsars ,",
    "this object has the second highest minimum companion mass and fifth highest projected orbital velocity .",
    "the orbital parameters of psr  j1528@xmath23146 are broadly similar to those of psr  j1157@xmath25112 , the low - eccentricity binary pulsar with the most massive white dwarf companion @xcite .",
    "the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath32x10@xmath26 ) is high compared to recycled pulsars with similar orbital periods .",
    "the large mass of the companion suggests a shorter duration spin - up phase , leaving less time to circularize the post - supernova orbit and transfer mass to the pulsar . at the dispersion measure of 18pc@xmath5 ,",
    "the implied distance is only about 1kpc .",
    "we have detected a potential optical counterpart at the pulsar timing position with @xmath27 .",
    "as with other optically - detected imbp companions , this is brighter than expected given the characteristic age of the pulsar , suggesting that the spin - down age overestimates the cooling age of the white dwarf and hence the time since the end of mass transfer in the system @xcite .",
    "our timing results obtained with the parkes filterbank for this 3.6ms pulsar have a weighted rms residual of 1.55@xmath13s over three years . using the caltech - parkes - swinburne recorder ii ( cpsr2",
    "; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a wide - bandwidth coherent dedispersion backend at parkes , @xcite have achieved an rms residual of only 650ns for this pulsar ; measurement of the shapiro delay constrains the orbital inclination to be between 59and 70  ( 95% confidence )",
    ". this pulsar will be an important part of pulsar timing array experiments aimed at detecting low - frequency gravitational waves emitted by coalescing supermassive black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "this 3.7ms lmbp scintillates very strongly at 1.4ghz , frequently making it undetectable in reasonable ( @xmath315 min ) integration times at parkes .",
    "in fact , four attempts were required to confirm this pulsar candidate highlighting why repeating this survey would no doubt turn up other pulsars that are , on average , below the nominal survey sensitivity limit .",
    "this strong scintillation partly explains why this pulsar was not discovered in previous arecibo surveys .",
    "we have not yet obtained a phase - connected timing solution for this pulsar .",
    "the minimum companion mass of 0.24 m@xmath28 , 16 day orbital period and inconsistent flux make it uninteresting for tests of general relativity with current instrumentation .",
    "this short period ( 3.4 ms ) pulsar s companion has a minimum mass of 0.32@xmath29  somewhat higher than the typical lmbp .",
    "the only other disk pulsars with companions of at least 0.3@xmath29 and spin periods shorter than 10ms are psr  j2019 + 2425 @xcite ( @xmath30ms ) with a much longer orbital period ( @xmath31d vs. 13d ) , and psr  j1757@xmath25322 @xcite ( @xmath32ms ) and psr  j1435@xmath26100 @xcite ( @xmath33ms ) with substantially more compact orbits ( @xmath34d and 0.45d respectively ) .",
    "this may mean that this pulsar has a nearly edge - on orbit or represents a limit to accretion spin - up given the mass of the companion .",
    "this 5.2ms pulsar is the only isolated msp found in this survey .",
    "approximately one - fourth of recycled pulsars not associated with globular clusters are isolated .",
    "the rms timing residual is 4 @xmath13s with a 256 mhz filterbank system , and there is no evidence of any planetary system like that surrounding the planet pulsar psr b1257 + 12 . with hour - long integrations and coherent dedispersion backend",
    ", we anticipate that a weighted rms resdiual of approximately @xmath35 will be possible for this pulsar with the parkes telescope and perhaps half that with the 100 m green bank telescope .",
    "this survey has once again demonstrated the efficacy of the parkes 64 m telescope s multibeam receiver for discovering recycled pulsars . the recycled pulsar discovery rate of one per 600 deg@xmath0 is comparable to that of edwards et al . (",
    "however , only one new recycled pulsar was discovered more than 25@xmath1 and less than 30@xmath1 from the plane , compared to the five between 5@xmath1 and 10@xmath1 from the plane , which may indicate that the density of msps detectable with this backend and telescope combination drops off considerably when more than 25@xmath1 from the galactic plane .",
    "the ratio of the number of recycled pulsars still in binaries compared to those that are now single puts a limit on the fraction of systems where recycling goes out of control , resulting in a solitary pulsar either because the pulsar gets too close to the companion and ablates it with its strong wind , or tidally disrupts the companion completely . in this survey 6 of the 7 recycled pulsars",
    "are in binary systems , which in itself suggests that in the majority of cases recycling is not fatal to the donor star .",
    "thanks to the parkes multibeam surveys the disk population of millisecond pulsars is now becoming large enough for us to search for trends that might explain why some millisecond pulsars are single and others are not , and which parameters are correlated .",
    "the recycled pulsars found in this survey have reinforced the previously observed trend of pulsars with high - mass companions having longer spin periods and higher eccentricities than those with low - mass companions .",
    "large - scale uniform surveys allow us to model the underlying populations properties , including the @xmath36-scale height of msps .",
    "there are 11 field msps ( defined for our purposes as having @xmath37ms ) with @xmath38kpc in the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite , with @xmath39-based distances provided by the ne2001 model @xcite for pulsars without direct distance estimates . of these pulsars ,",
    "4 were discovered by the parkes 70 cm survey @xcite , and none by the swinburne surveys ( though we would have expected these surveys to have similar sensitivities to high-@xmath40 pulsars ) .",
    "the arecibo surveys that are responsible for most of the rest are difficult to model . to investigate the implications of the large - area parkes surveys we simulated a population of 100,000 msps with a wide range in luminosity and a scale height of 500pc .",
    "our simulation predicted that half of all discoveries should have @xmath41kpc for the parkes 70 cm and the swinburne surveys . in reality , only about 13% of the msps detected have @xmath42 0.5kpc , which either suggests that 0.5 kpc is an overestimate of their scale height , or our modeling of their luminosities is incorrect .",
    "we note that somewhat different results are obtained using the older @xcite galactic electron model to estimate distances . based on this model , there are 17 msps with @xmath38kpc , 5 of which were discovered in the parkes 70 cm survey and 5 of which were discovered by the swinburne surveys .",
    "this suggests that values of the @xmath36 scale height from previous population studies based on the older distance model , such as the @xmath43kpc gaussian scale height of @xcite , will be revised downward by the use of the new galactic electron model .    again restricting ourselves to disk pulsars with @xmath37ms",
    ", we find 15 isolated msps and 44 in binary systems .",
    "the distribution of height above the galactic plane is shown for these two populations in figure [ fig : zhist ] .",
    "the rms deviation from @xmath44 is @xmath45pc for isolated msps and @xmath46pc for binary msps ( if we consider only pulsars with @xmath47ms the isolated sample is unchanged , while the binary sample drops to 37 objects with rms in @xmath36 of @xmath48pc ) .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained by @xcite using a sample of 9 isolated and 20 binary pulsars with @xmath47ms .",
    "the median distance to the isolated and binary msps in our sample is 960pc and 1240pc respectively , regardless of the period cutoff used .",
    "the difference between these two populations is less than that noted by @xcite , who found more than a factor of two difference in their sample .",
    "this result may suggest that the luminosity distributions of isolated and binary msps are not as different as previously thought , with implications for the birth velocity distributions required by the different observed scale heights .",
    "a flux monitoring campaign on a large population of msps including those discovered here should enable direct investigation of the tantalising scale height ",
    "luminosity question for isolated and binary msps .",
    "if the isolated msps really do have lower luminosities we would expect them to have had a different accretion history than those still in binary systems . if it is the tight binary msps that evolve into isolated msps through either ablation or tidal destruction of their companions , then we might expect different underlying velocity distributions and therefore different scale heights for the isolated and binary populations .",
