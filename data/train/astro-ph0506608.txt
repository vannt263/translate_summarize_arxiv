    "deep  surveys have uncovered a large population of submillimeter ( submm ; @xmath19  =  3001000  @xmath20 m ) emitting galaxies ( smgs ; @xmath21  1000 sources deg@xmath22 at @xmath23  ; e.g. ,  smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; barger , cowie & sanders 1999 ; blain 1999 , 2002 ; eales 1999 ; cowie 2002 ; scott 2002 ; borys 2003 ; webb 2003a ) .",
    "the majority of these smgs are faint at all other wavelengths , hindering source identification studies ( e.g. ,  hughes 1998 ; ivison 2000 ; smail 2002 ; webb 2003b ) . however , due to a considerable amount of intensive multi - wavelength follow - up effort , it is becoming clear that almost all are dust - enshrouded luminous galaxies at ( e.g. ,  ivison 1998 , 2000 ; barger 1999 ; chapman 2003a , 2005 ; simpson 2004 ; pope 2005 ) . with estimated bolometric luminosities of order @xmath24  ( blain 2004a ; chapman 2005 ) ,",
    "smgs outnumber comparably luminous galaxies in the local universe by several orders of magnitude ( e.g. ,  cowie 2004 ) .",
    "dynamical mass and galaxy clustering studies of spectroscopically identified smgs have indicated that they are likely to be massive galaxies ( e.g. ,  frayer 1998 , 1999 ; genzel 2003 ; neri 2003 ; blain 2004b ; swinbank 2004 ; greve 2005 ) ; these smgs are @xmath2  5 times more massive than the coeval optically selected field galaxies ( e.g. ,  erb 2003 ; steidel 2004 ; swinbank 2004 ) . making reasonable assumptions about the duration of the submm - bright phase in these systems ,",
    "these results provide evidence that smgs are the progenitors of local @xmath25 early - type galaxies ( e.g. ,  lilly 1999 ; scott 2002 ; smail 2004 ; chapman 2005 ) .",
    "central to the study of smgs is the physical origin of their extreme luminosities [ i.e. ,  starburst or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity ] .",
    "if these sources are shown to be ultra - luminous starburst galaxies then their derived star - formation rates suggest a substantial increase in star - formation activity at @xmath26 ( e.g. ,  blain 1999 ; smail 2002 ) .",
    "conversely , if these sources are shown to be powerful agns then they outnumber comparably luminous optical quasars by @xmath2  12 orders of magnitude . the apparent association of a few smgs with quasars and their comparable comoving space densities ( when corrected for probable source lifetimes ) suggest an evolutionary connection between these two populations ( e.g. ,  page 2001 , 2004 ; croom 2004 ; stevens 2003 , 2004 ; chapman 2005 ) . given this evidence it is plausible that smgs represent a rapid black - hole and stellar growth stage prior to a luminous quasar phase ( e.g. ,  archibald 2002 ; almaini 2003 ; page 2004 ; alexander 2005a ) .",
    "arguably the most direct indication of agn activity is the detection of luminous hard x - ray emission ( i.e. ,  @xmath27  2  kev ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission appears to be a universal property of agns , giving a direct `` window '' on the emission regions closest to the smbh ( e.g.,mushotzky , done , & pounds 1993 ) , and it can provide a secure agn identification in sources where the optical signatures and counterparts are weak or even non existent ( e.g. ,  alexander 2001 ; comastri 2002 ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission is relatively insensitive to obscuration ( at least for sources that are compton thin ; i.e. ,  @xmath28  @xmath8 ) and any hard x - ray emission from star formation in the host galaxy is often insignificant when compared to that produced by the agn .",
    "the first cross - correlation studies of moderately deep ( )  surveys with  surveys yielded little overlap between the x - ray and submm detected source populations ( @xmath211020% ; e.g. ,  fabian 2000 ; bautz 2000 ; hornschemeier 2000 ; severgnini 2000 ) . to first order",
    "these results suggested that bolometrically dominant agns can only be present in typical smgs if they are compton thick .",
    "later studies with the  deep field - north ( cdf - n ; brandt 2001 , alexander 2003a ) survey showed that a significant fraction ( upwards of @xmath2  3050% when the borys 2003  map is used ) of smgs are x - ray detected ( barger 2001b ; alexander 2003b ; borys 2004 ) .",
    "direct x - ray spectral analyses of the five agn - classified smgs in alexander ( 2003b ) indicated that the agns were heavily obscured but only moderately luminous at x - ray energies ( @xmath29  0.31@xmath30  erg  s@xmath3 when corrected for the effects of absorption ) .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray - to - submm spectral slopes of these smgs to that of ngc  6240 ( a nearby luminous galaxy with an obscured agn ) suggested that the agns typically contributed only a few percent of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "however , the small sample size and lack of spectroscopic redshifts ( only one source had a spectroscopic redshift ) prevented more quantitative conclusions .    the deep optical spectroscopic work of chapman ( 2003a , 2005 ) has recently provided spectroscopic redshifts for 73 radio - identified smgs , a significant increase in sample size over previous studies ( e.g. ,  ivison 1998 , 2000 ; barger 1999 ; ledlow 2002 ; smail 2003 ; simpson 2004 ) .",
    "the 2  ms cdf - n field was one of the regions targeted for this intensive spectroscopic follow up .",
    "the combination of deep optical spectroscopic data and ultra - deep x - ray observations provides powerful constraints on agns in smgs .",
    "in particular , spectroscopic redshifts improve the accuracy of the x - ray spectral analyses over those of alexander ( 2003b ) through the identification of discrete x - ray spectral features ( e.g.,fe  k@xmath17 emission ) and the determination of any intrinsic absorption , which is a strong function of redshift in a given x - ray band [ @xmath31 .",
    "these improvements promise the most accurate determination of the agn contribution to the bolometric output of these smgs to date . in this paper",
    "we investigate the x - ray properties of the radio - selected spectroscopically identified smgs in the cdf - n field and predict the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity of these smgs .",
    "the galactic column density toward the cdf - n field is @xmath32  @xmath8 ( lockman 2004 ) , and @xmath33  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are adopted throughout .",
    "our  galaxy sample includes 20 smgs that have been spectroscopically identified by chapman ( 2005 ) and lie in the region of the 2  ms cdf - n observation ( alexander et  al .",
    "the optical counterparts for these sources were chosen based on the positional association with a radio source [ identified by either vla ( richards 2000 ) or merlin ( chapman 2004a ) observations ] .",
    "the basic properties of the smgs are given in table  1 .",
    "the source redshifts ( @xmath36  0.5552.914 with a median of @xmath36  2.0@xmath370.6 ) are typical of the spectroscopically identified smg population ( median redshift of @xmath38  2.2 ; chapman 2005 ) .",
    "the @xmath2  3550% of sources without radio counterparts ( e.g.,ivison 2002 ; chapman 2003b ; borys 2004 ) could not be targeted with optical spectroscopy . however , the range of 850@xmath20 m flux densities for the submm sample ( @xmath39  412  mjy , with a mean of @xmath40  mjy ) is typical of smgs detected in blank - field  surveys ( e.g. ,  scott 2002 ; webb 2003a ) .",
    "the potential selection effects introduced by the radio and spectroscopic - identification of this sample , compared to a purely submm - flux - limited sample of smgs , are discussed at length in chapman ( 2005 ) and blain ( 2004 ) . the need for both a faint radio counterpart and identifiable spectral features to aid in redshift measurement may result in this sample having a higher incidence of agn activity than the smg population as a whole ; however , the incompleteness in our surveys due to these two selection criteria can be equally well explained by the likely temperature and redshift distribution of the smg population ( chapman et al .",
    "nevertheless , we caution the reader that the sample analysed here may not be completely representative of the entire @xmath23  4  mjy smg population .",
    "many of the smgs in our sample were radio - selected sources specifically targeted with scuba observations ; see the table in alexander ( 2005a ) for the observation modes .",
    "while this could potentially cause an additional agn bias over a purely radio - detected smg sample , we do not find evidence for a strong bias in our sample ( see alexander 2005a for the results of a two - sided fisher s exact test ) .",
    "the 2  ms cdf - n observations were centered on the optical hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ; williams 1996 ) region and cover @xmath41  arcmin@xmath42 ( alexander et  al .",
    "these observations provide the deepest view of the universe in the 0.58.0  kev band ; the aim - point sensitivities are  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 at 0.58.0  kev ( full band ) ,  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 at 0.52.0  kev ( soft band ) , and  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 at 28  kev ( hard band ) . at the median redshift of the smgs ,",
    "the observed 0.58.0  kev band corresponds to rest - frame energies of 1.524  kev .",
    "such high x - ray energies allow very high column densities to be penetrated ( e.g. ,  at 20  kev , @xmath21  55% of the direct x - ray emission is absorbed with column densities of @xmath43  @xmath8 ; see appendix  b in deluit & courvoisier 2003 ) .    using a 1.5@xmath44  search radius , 16 of the 20 smgs were found to have  counterparts in the main  catalog of alexander ( 2003a ) . given the low surface density of smgs , we also searched for x - ray counterparts using the complete supplementary catalog of alexander ( 2003a ) and found one further match ; the probability of this match being spurious is ( see  2.4 of alexander et  al .",
    "in total 17 ( @xmath45% ) of the 20 smgs in our sample have a  counterpart ( see table  1 ) .",
    "level ; these were calculated assuming poisson statistics . ] we have calculated rest - frame 0.58.0  kev luminosities , and 1.4  ghz luminosity densities following equations 1 and 2 in alexander ( 2003b ) , assuming an x - ray spectral slope of @xmath46 and a radio spectral slope of @xmath47 , respectively . far - infrared ( far - ir ; @xmath19  =  40120  @xmath20 m ) luminosities were calculated from the rest - frame 1.4  ghz luminosity densities under the assumption of the radio - to - far - ir correlation with @xmath48 ( e.g. ,  helou , soifer , & rowan - robinson 1985 ) ; the presence of an agn component to the radio emission will lead to an overprediction of the far - ir luminosity .",
    "see table  1 .",
    "the three x - ray undetected smgs lie in sensitive regions of the cdf - n field and have 3  @xmath49 flux limits below the fluxes of the x - ray detected smgs ; see table  1 .",
    "their redshifts ( @xmath36  2.02.1 ) are consistent with the median redshift of the smg sample . stacking the x - ray data of the individually undetected smgs following the procedure of lehmer ( 2005 ) yields marginally significant detections in the soft and full bands ( @xmath50 , soft band ; @xmath51 , full band ; s.  immler , private communication ) , suggesting that these sources lie just below the individual source detection limit . the corresponding average x - ray constraints are @xmath52  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 ( full band ) , @xmath53  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 ( soft band ) and @xmath54  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 ( hard band ) .",
    "the full - band constraint corresponds to @xmath55  erg  s@xmath3 at @xmath56 for @xmath46 and is consistent with that expected from luminous star formation ( see  3.2 and  4.2 ) .",
    "x - ray spectra were generated for all of the smgs with full - band fluxes  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 , which typically corresponds to @xmath57 x - ray counts . to account for",
    "the range of roll angles and aim points in the 20 separate observations that comprise the 2  ms the x - ray spectra were generated using the acis source extraction code ( acis extract ) described in broos ( 2002 ) .",
    "briefly , for each source this code extracts the counts from each of the observations taking into account the changing shape and size of the psf with off - axis angle as given in the  x - ray center ( cxc ) psf library .",
    "a local background is extracted after all of the sources are excluded from the x - ray event file , and the spectra and response matrices are summed using standard ftools routines ( blackburn 1995 ) .",
    "see f.  e.  bauer et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) for further information and the x - ray spectral properties of the sources detected in the deep fields",
    ".    given the limited counting statistics of the x - ray sources , we performed all of the x - ray spectral analyses using the @xmath58-statistic ( cash 1979 ) .",
    "one advantage of using the @xmath58-statistic is that the data can be fitted without binning , making it ideally suited to low - count sources ( e.g. ,  nousek & shue 1989 ) .",
    "a disadvantage of using the @xmath58-statistic is that it is not possible to determine rigorously if one model provides a statistically preferable fit than another ; however , it is possible to inspect the fit residuals and perform monte - carlo analyses to distinguish between different models .",
    "hence in our analyses we have focused on empirically motivated models which have proven to provide a robust characterisation of the properties of well - studied agns .",
    "we used the latest version of xspec ( v11.3.1 ; arnaud 1996 , 2002 ) for all of the model fitting , which allows the @xmath58-statistic to be used on background - subtracted data ; we carried out several checks of the background - subtraction method to verify that no spurious residual features were present in the background - subtracted data .",
    "we fitted the x - ray spectra of the smgs using a power law model ( with galactic absorption ) in the rest - frame 210  kev and 520  kev bands ; see table  2 .",
    "the constraints on the five sources with @xmath59 counts are poor .",
    "however , our analyses have been designed to maximize the useful constraints for even the weakest x - ray sources .",
    "the fit parameter uncertainties are quoted at the 90% confidence level for one parameter of interest ( avni 1976 ) .",
    "we provide details of our analysis techniques below but defer the discussion of our results to  3 .            in order to interpret the x - ray spectral fitting results",
    "we have developed an empirically motivated agn model and constructed a simple rest - frame power - law diagnostic diagram .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we only need to perform simple rest - frame power law fits to the sources , allowing us to determine the characteristics of sources with few x - ray counts .",
    "our adopted agn model includes a power - law component ( which can be absorbed by neutral material ; @xmath60 ) , a neutral reflection component ( the pexrav model in xspec ) , a scattered component ( sc ) of ionised gas , and a fe  k@xmath17 emission line at 6.4  kev .",
    "the xpsec model components for our adopted model are ( pow+pexrav+zga)+pow*zwabs .",
    "we used the xspec command @xmath61 to produce the model tracks for a range of x - ray spectral slopes ( @xmath62  1.32.3 ) and absorbing column densities ( @xmath63  @xmath62@xmath64  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ratio of the direct to reflected emission ( i.e. ,  @xmath65 in the pexrav model ) was fixed to unity , in agreement with the average value found for local agns ( e.g. ,  risaliti 2002 ; deluit & courvoisier 2003 ; malizia 2003 ) .",
    "we set the other parameters of the neutral reflection component to be the same as those in model 2c of malizia ( 2003 ) .",
    "the ionised gas scattering fraction was set to be 1% of the intrinsic power - law emission , and the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath17 emission line was varied depending on the absorbing column density ( @xmath66  kev for @xmath67  @xmath8 , @xmath68  kev for @xmath63  37@xmath15  @xmath8 , and @xmath69  kev for @xmath70  @xmath8 ; see risaliti 2002 and malizia 2003 ) .",
    "we also investigated higher column densities with a varying amount of ionised gas scattering fraction [ @xmath71  @xmath8 ( i.e. ,  pure reflection ) and sc  =  010% ] . to take account of the  acis - i instrumental response we used the response matrix file ( rmf ) and ancillary response file ( arf ) from cxohdfn  j123629.1 + 621045 . to allow for the construction of the model tracks up to rest - frame energies of 20  kev we assumed a redshift of @xmath72 , consistent with the average redshift of the smg sample .",
    "we also attempted to fit directly the individual x - ray spectra of the smgs with the empirically motivated model outlined above .",
    "however , we could not statistically constrain these models sufficiently to gain additional physical insight over that found using the power - law diagnostic diagram analyses .",
    "this was most likely due to a degeneracy in the number of model components and the generally poor photon statistics of the individual x - ray spectra .",
    "we show the submm flux density versus full - band flux of all of the smgs in figure  1 . as a comparison",
    "we also show the submm and x - ray properties of samples of moderate - to - high redshift quasars ( @xmath38  15 ; page 2001 ; vignali 2001 ; isaak 2002 ) . the average redshift and submm flux density of the page ( 2001 ) quasars ( @xmath73 and @xmath74  mjy ) are consistent with those of our smgs ; however , the median x - ray flux of the smgs is @xmath2  30 times fainter .",
    "the submm properties of quasars are proving to be important from the point of view of the processes of star formation at high redshift and providing clues to the relationship between the formation of smgs , quasars , and massive galaxies ( e.g. ,  stevens 2003 , 2004 ; page 2004 ) .",
    "however , the x - ray properties of spectroscopically identified smgs can only be investigated with ultra - deep x - ray observations .      due to the exceptional sensitivity of the 2  ms observations it is possible to detect x - ray emission from star formation out to high redshift .",
    "for example , the soft - band flux limit at the aim point corresponds to @xmath75  8  @xmath76  erg  s@xmath3 for a galaxy at @xmath56 .",
    "this luminosity is comparable to those for the most x - ray luminous starburst galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. ,  ngc  3256 ; moran 1999 ; lira 2002 ) , sources that are bolometrically less energetic than smgs by @xmath2  1 order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the detection of x - ray emission from an smg does not _ a priori _ indicate the presence of agn activity . in order to classify the smgs in our sample",
    "we have used a two - tiered classification procedure .",
    "this classification procedure is conservative and may not identify all of the smgs that host agn activity .",
    "however , we can be confident that any agn classifications are secure .    the first method of source classification is based on the effective x - ray spectral slope ; see figure  2a .",
    "star - forming galaxies and unobscured agns generally have comparatively steep x - ray spectral slopes ( i.e. ,  @xmath77  2 ; e.g. ,  kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992a , b ; nandra & pounds 1994 ; ptak 1999 ; george 2000 ; colbert 2004 ) .  0.7  kev thermal component ; ptak 1999 ) ; however , at the probable redshifts of our sources the very soft thermal component will be redshifted out of the energy band . ]",
    "obscured agns are usually distinguishable from unobscured agns and star - forming galaxies by the presence of a flat x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath78 ) due to the energy - dependent photo - electric absorption of the x - ray emission ( e.g. ,  maiolino 1998 ; risaliti , maiolino , & salvati 1999 ) .",
    "however , since smgs are potentially massive galaxies undergoing intense star formation , they could have a large population of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , which may have comparatively flat x - ray spectral slopes ( e.g.,neutron star hmxbs can have @xmath77  0.51.0 ; colbert 2004 ) .",
    "eleven of the 17 x - ray detected smgs have @xmath79 , unambiguously indicating the presence of a heavily obscured agn",
    ".    the second method of source classification focuses on the expected x - ray emission from star formation ; see figure  2b .",
    "many studies have shown that the radio luminosity can be used to predict the x - ray luminosity in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. ,  shapley , fabbiano , & eskridge 2001 ; bauer 2002 ; ranalli 2003 ; grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003 ; gilfanov , grimm , & sunyaev 2004 ; persic 2004 ) .",
    "the main assumption in these predictions is that the radio emission is dominated by star formation ; however , the presence of an agn component to the radio emission will only lead to an overprediction of the contribution from star formation at x - ray energies .",
    "the normalisation and slope of these x - ray  radio relationships differ depending upon the relative contributions from low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; hmxbs ; gilfanov 2004 ; persic 2004 ; see figure  2b ) .",
    "since the properties of smgs indicate that they are undergoing intense star - formation activity , we only need to consider the contribution from hmxbs ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "the predicted x - ray emission from star formation in smgs is large ( up to @xmath80@xmath10  erg  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "even so , all of the sources classified as agns show an x - ray excess due to agn activity ; these x - ray excesses will be even greater once the x - ray luminosities are corrected for the effect of absorption . with this second method",
    "a further four sources show a clear x - ray excess over that predicted from star formation , indicating that their x - ray emission is dominated by agn activity .",
    "four of the 10 agn - classified smgs with @xmath81 counts also show some evidence for x - ray variability ( m.  paolillo , private communication ; see table  1 ) , a further signature of agn activity ; these constraints are consistent with those found for similarly bright agns in the  deep field - south ( paolillo 2004 ) .",
    "none of the sources that have x - ray emission consistent with star formation show evidence for x - ray variability , although the photon statistics are poor .",
    "overall , the x - ray emission from 15 ( @xmath82% ) of the 20 smgs in the sample is agn dominated .",
    "the other five smgs are the faintest x - ray sources in the sample , and three sources are undetected in the x - ray band ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from these five sources is likely to be dominated by star - formation activity ( see  4.2 for further constraints ) ; however , heavily obscured or x - ray weak agns can not be ruled out ( e.g. ,  compare with the similar @xmath83 galaxy fsc  10214 + 4724 ; alexander 2005b ) .",
    "we caution the reader that , due to our sample selection and completeness , these results do not directly indicate a @xmath2  75% agn fraction in the bright smg population ( the agn fraction is probably @xmath84% ; alexander 2005a , consistent with earlier estimates from the x - ray data ; e.g. ,  alexander 2003b ; borys 2004 ; wang , cowie , & barger 2004 ) .",
    "the flat x - ray spectral slopes for the majority of the agn - classified smgs indicates the presence of absorption .",
    "basic x - ray absorption constraints can be set using the x - ray band ratio ( defined as the ratio of the hard - band to soft - band count rate ) ; see figure  3 .",
    "this approach has limited diagnostic utility because agns often have more complex spectra than that of power - law emission with differing amounts of absorption .",
    "however , it suggests that the majority of the sources are heavily obscured ( i.e. ,  @xmath85  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the obscured agns could be considerably greater than the observed luminosity if the obscuration is high .    in order to estimate the amount of absorption in each of the agn - classified smgs",
    "more accurately we have constructed a rest - frame power - law diagnostic diagram ; see  2.3 and figure  4 .",
    "the tracks on this diagram show the approximate regions where typical agns are likely to lie ; since we investigate rest - frame energies up to 20  kev , cxohdfn  j123636.7 + 621156 with a redshift of only @xmath86 can not be included in these analyses .",
    "the agn - classified smgs are clearly well represented by this diagram and , on the basis of our model tracks , 12 ( @xmath2  80% ) are heavily obscured ( @xmath87  @xmath8 ) . under the assumption that the different x - ray spectral properties of the smgs are due to absorption",
    ", the lower energy x - ray emission should be more strongly attenuated than the higher energy x - ray emission .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  5 where the implied attenuations from the luminosity ratios in the 210 and 520  kev bands are in agreement with those expected from the rest - frame 520  kev spectral slopes and the results from figure  4 .",
    "the constraints on the absorption properties of individual sources are comparatively poor . to provide tighter overall constraints we performed joint spectral fitting of all of the sources in the three different obscuration classes indicated in figure  5 ( @xmath88  @xmath8 , @xmath89  15  @xmath15  @xmath8 , and @xmath90  @xmath8 ) .",
    "we jointly fitted the rest - frame 210  kev and 520  kev spectral",
    "slopes of the sources , leaving the power - law normalisations as a free parameter for each source .",
    "the results of this joint spectral fitting are shown in figure  6 .",
    "the average absorbing column densities for the sources in each obscuration class are in excellent agreement with those implied from the individual x - ray spectral analyses .",
    "furthermore , the average intrinsic x - ray spectral slopes estimated from the model tracks ( @xmath77  1.8 ) are in good agreement with those found for typical agns in the local universe ( e.g. ,  nandra & pounds 1994 ; george 2000 ) .      the previous analyses have provided the broad - band x - ray spectral properties of the agn - classified smgs but have not been sensitive to discrete emission features ( e.g. ,  fe  k@xmath17 emission ) .",
    "unambiguous fe  k@xmath17 emission has not been identified in any of the individual x - ray spectra and , due to poor photon statistics , it is difficult to constrain the x - ray continuum either side of the emission line , which significantly affects the accuracy of fe  k@xmath17 constraints .",
    "it is not possible to improve greatly the fe  k@xmath17 constraints via joint spectral fitting since the critical parameters are the emission - line and x - ray continuum normalisations , which vary from source to source .",
    "however , we can improve the overall signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra by stacking the data for the sources in each obscuration class and searching for the direct signature of fe  k@xmath17 emission in these composite x - ray spectra .        when combining different x - ray spectra it is important to take into account the effective area and effective exposure of each source .",
    "we used xspec to output the unbinned x - ray spectrum of each source , folded by its effective area and effective exposure .",
    "we then redshift corrected each x - ray spectrum to create a rest - frame spectrum for each source .",
    "these rest - frame spectra were combined and then binned to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . since the spectral response of  acis - i varies with energy , in principal",
    "it is necessary to take into account the spectral response for each source when their spectra are redshifted .",
    "however , in the case of our sources the limiting factor is photon statistics rather than spectral resolution ( e.g. ,  see  3.3 of alexander 2003b ) .",
    "composite rest - frame 220  kev spectra for the three different obscuration classes are shown in figure  7 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of these x - ray spectra is significantly higher than the individual x - ray spectra and discrete features and the accurate shape of the x - ray continua can be seen .",
    "the obscured agns ( @xmath91  @xmath8 ) show a clear deficit of emission at @xmath21  5  kev due to absorption . as expected",
    ", there is a good correspondence between the amount of absorption and obscuration class .",
    "we plotted the model spectra determined from the joint x - ray spectral fitting ( see figure  6 and  3.3 ) and normalised them to the composite x - ray spectra by eye ; see figure  7 .",
    "reassuringly , the model tracks provide a good description of the composite x - ray spectra , validating the results from the x - ray spectral analyses ( figures  36 ) and showing that the variations in the properties of the individual x - ray spectra are due to absorption .",
    "an emission feature at the rest - frame energy of fe  k@xmath17 is seen in the composite spectrum of the most heavily obscured agns ( @xmath92  @xmath8 ) ; see figure  7 .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width of this feature ( @xmath2  1  kev ) is consistent with that expected for compton - thick or near compton - thick agns ( e.g.,bassani 1999 ) and suggests that some of the x - ray emission is reflected and/or scattered ( e.g. ,  matt , brandt , & fabian 1996 ) .",
    "the rest - frame energy of this feature is closer to 6.7  kev than 6.4  kev , possibly indicating that it is produced in a warm scattering medium rather than from cold reflection , or that contributions from both are present .",
    "however , given the poor signal - to - noise ratio and effective spectral resolution of the data , we can not distinguish between these possibilities ( e.g. ,  compare the different signal - to - noise ratio spectra of ngc  1068 and ngc  2992 in figure  4 of turner 1997a ) .",
    "if all of the x - ray emission was reflected / scattered then we would not be able to get an accurate estimate of the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the agns in this obscuration class .",
    "however , at least for the properties of our model , a significant fraction of the direct x - ray emission is seen at @xmath93  kev , providing a reasonable constraint on the underlying agn luminosity .",
    "there is ambiguous evidence for fe  k@xmath17 in the composite spectra of the @xmath94  @xmath8 sources , potentially indicating the presence of compton - thick or near compton - thick agn emission that is additionally obscured by starburst regions ( e.g. ,  fabian 1998 ) .",
    "improved photon statistics are required to test this scenario ; see  4.4 .    in figure  7",
    "there appears to be an excess of @xmath95  kev emission with respect to the model in the composite spectrum of the most heavily obscured sources ( @xmath90  @xmath8 ) , which may be due to star formation .",

    "we further investigate the x - ray emission from star formation in  4.2 .      since accurate absorption corrections are challenging to determine even for well - studied obscured agns in the local universe ( e.g.,turner 1997b ; bassani 1999 ; matt 2000 ) , the absorption corrections for our x - ray faint smgs will be somewhat uncertain . thankfully , the composite x - ray spectra have shown that our agn model gives a good characterisation of the x - ray properties of the agn - classified smgs and therefore provides a good base for determining plausible absorption corrections . in table  2 we show our estimated unabsorbed x - ray luminosities for each of the agn - classified smgs using our agn model and the column - density constraints from figures 45 .",
    "although the absorption corrections for the most heavily obscured objects ( @xmath90  @xmath8 ) are the most uncertain , they are consistent with those previously estimated for similar sources with comparable column densities and reflection / scattering components ( e.g. ,  iwasawa 2001 , 2005b ; fabian 2003 ; wilman 2003 ) .",

    "although this may suggest a prevalence for obscured activity in the smg population , selection effects are also likely to be at least partially responsible .",
    "for example , due to the comparatively high redshifts of our sources we probe considerably higher rest - frame energies than those for the bulk of the spectroscopically identified sources in deep x - ray surveys [ e.g.,@xmath2  1.524  kev ( at @xmath38  2 ) as compared to @xmath2  0.914  kev ( at @xmath38  0.7 ) at observed energies of 0.58.0  kev ] , allowing higher column densities to be penetrated .",

    "these optically faint x - ray sources are the dominant population of obscured agns at @xmath26 and may account for as much as @xmath2  50% of the agns detected in deep x - ray surveys ( alexander 2002 ) . complete spectroscopic identification of these sources is required to determine the obscured to unobscured agn ratio at @xmath26 and reveal whether our x - ray detected smgs are preferentially more obscured than the general @xmath26 x - ray source population .",
    "agn activity clearly plays an important role in the spectroscopically identified smg population but does it dominate the bolometric output ?",
    "the answer to this key question can have important implications for the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and the growth of massive black holes ( see  1 ) . as found for most dusty luminous galaxies ,",
    "the luminosity of smgs is likely to peak at far - ir wavelengths and have components of both agn and star - formation activity ( e.g. ,  sanders & mirabel 1996 ; genzel & cesarsky 2000 ) .",
    "many studies have suggested that star formation accounts for a large fraction of the bolometric output of smgs ( e.g. ,  frayer 1998 , 2004 ; ivison 2002 , 2004 ; alexander 2003b ; almaini 2003 ; chapman 2004a ; egami 2004 ; swinbank 2004 ) but none has resolved the rest - frame far - ir emission .",
    "the most direct study to date is that of chapman ( 2004a ) who showed that @xmath2  70% of radio - identified smgs have radio emission extended on @xmath2  10  kpc scales , implying that the rest - frame far - ir emission is also extended over these scales .",
    "however , these results do not rule out the presence of energetically significant agn components on smaller scales .",
    "the important contribution our study can make to this debate is in providing direct estimates of the bolometric contribution from agn activity .    in figure  8",
    "we show the rest - frame far - ir luminosity versus unabsorbed 0.58.0  kev luminosity for the smgs and compare them to well - studied starburst galaxies and agns drawn from the literature .",

    "this comparison indicates that star formation typically dominates the bolometric output of these smgs .",
    "however , if the smgs have an agn dust - covering factor @xmath2  12 times larger than found in the quasars then they could potentially be agn dominated ( i.e. ,  a larger amount of dust could be heated for a given central source luminosity ) .",
    "although the large fraction of obscured agns in our sample suggests that the dust - covering factor is large in these smgs , the dust - covering factor of quasars is uncertain and may depend on the evolutionary state or nature of individual objects ( e.g. ,  haas 2003 ; page 2004 ) .",
    "we can take a different approach and compare our smgs to the literature galaxies , many of which host an obscured agn and may be physically similar to the smgs ; see figure  8 .",
    "the complication of this comparison is that the relative contribution from agn and star - formation activity in these galaxies is often poorly constrained .",
    "even so , we can gain some insight into the relative dominance of agn and star - formation activity by `` calibrating '' figure  8 using the  mid - ir spectral diagnostics of rigopoulou ( 1999 ) and tran ( 2001 ) ; see also genzel ( 1999 ) and lutz , veilleux , & genzel ( 1999 ) .",
    "on the basis of these studies , we have found that the        threshold between the agn - dominated and star - formation dominated literature galaxies is @xmath116  0.004 ; of the 35 galaxies in rigopoulou ( 1999 ) and tran ( 2001 ) , all of the 17 agn - dominated galaxies have @xmath117  0.004 while 13 of the 18 star - formation dominated galaxies have @xmath118  0.004 ( see figure  8) .",
    "this indicates that agn - dominated galaxies can lie outside of the shaded region in figure  8 and suggests that the elvis ( 1994 ) bolometric correction is unlikely to be applicable for all sources .",
    "the implication of these results is that some of the smgs could be predominantly powered by agn activity even though the majority are likely to be star - formation dominated .",
    "however , since different techniques often yield contrasting results ( e.g. ,  farrah 2003 ) , and the exact contributions from agn and star - formation activity are uncertain _ even _ in extremely well - studied local galaxies ( e.g.,spoon 2000 ; lutz 2003 ; iwasawa 2005a ) , this conclusion can only be considered qualitative .",
    "deep mid - ir spectroscopy with the  telescope should provide important additional insight into the relative contributions from agn and star - formation activity in these smgs ( e.g. ,  lutz 2005 for the first constraints )",

    "we also show the x - ray and far - ir luminosities of the starburst - classified smgs",
    ". the mean x - ray - to - far - ir luminosity ratio of these sources ( @xmath119 , when the x - ray stacking result of the three x - ray undetected smgs is included ; see  2.2 ) is consistent with that expected from star formation if the x - ray emission is dominated by hmxbs ( persic 2004 ; see also figure  2b and  3.2 ) . under this assumption",
    "the x - ray derived star - formation rates ( @xmath2  13002700  yr@xmath3 ) are in good agreement with those determined using other techniques ( e.g. ,  swinbank 2004 ; chapman 2005 ) .",
    "the mean x - ray - to - far - ir luminosity ratio is @xmath2  4 times lower than that found for typical starburst galaxies in the local universe .",
    "however , as argued in persic ( 2004 ; see also franceschini 2003 ) , the x - ray emission from typical starburst galaxies will be dominated by long - lived lmxbs , which will be comparatively weak in intense star - forming galaxies .",
    "of course , the weak x - ray emission from these sources could also imply that luminous completely compton - thick agns are present ( e.g. ,  iwasawa 2005a ) .",
    "in alexander ( 2005a ) we used the results presented here to constrain the growth of black holes in massive star - forming galaxies .",
    "we showed that the agn fraction in the bright smg population is @xmath27  38@xmath120% , when corrected for bright smgs without spectroscopic redshifts , and argued that this indicates that their black holes are almost continuously growing throughout vigorous star - formation episodes .",
    "the most likely catalyst for this activity appeared to be galaxy major mergers ( e.g. ,  chapman 2003c ; conselice 2003 ) . shortly after the completion of our study sophisticated hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy major mergers , taking into account the growth of both the black hole and stellar components , were published ( e.g. ,  di matteo 2005 ; springel 2005 ) .",
    "the simulation results are in good agreement with the conclusions of alexander ( 2005a ) , with the peak epoch of star formation corresponding to a heavily obscured rapid black - hole growth phase , which is ultimately proceeded by an unobscured quasar phase ( hopkins 2005 ) .",
    "however , the black holes of the most massive galaxies in these simulations ( which are probably most similar to the smgs ) are up - to an order of magnitude more massive than those estimated from our x - ray luminosities under the assumption of eddington - limited accretion ( @xmath121  ) .",
    "our results can be better reconciled with the simulations if either the black holes in the agn - classified smgs are accreting at sub - eddington rates , a large fraction of the agn activity is hidden at rest - frame energies of @xmath2  20  kev ( see  3.5 ) , or the x - ray - to - bolometric luminosity ratio is significantly lower than that typically assumed for agns ( i.e. ,  elvis 1994 ; see table  1 of alexander 2005a for further details ) . however , there is further observational evidence that the masses of the black holes in smgs may be comparatively modest and in good agreement with our estimate .",
    "rest - frame optical spectra of smgs show that when broad emission lines are detected they are often comparatively narrow ( typical full width at half - maximum velocities of @xmath2  10003000  km  @xmath3 ; vernet & cimatti 2001 ; smail 2003 ; swinbank 2004 , 2005 ; t.  takata , in preparation ) . under the assumption that the dynamics of the broad - line regions in these sources are dominated by the gravity of the central black hole , these comparatively narrow emission line widths suggest typical black - hole masses of @xmath122  for mass accretion rates of @xmath21  1  @xmath123  yr@xmath3 ( alexander 2005a ; e.g. ,  mclure & dunlop 2004 ) .",

    "<S> deep  surveys have uncovered a large population of massive submillimeter emitting galaxies ( smgs ; @xmath0  4  mjy ) at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> although it is generally believed that these galaxies host intense star - formation activity , there is growing evidence that a substantial fraction also harbor an active galactic nucleus [ agn ; i.e. , an accreting super - massive black hole ( smbh ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we present here possibly the strongest evidence for this viewpoint to date : the combination of ultra - deep x - ray observations ( the 2  ms  deep field - north ) and deep keck spectroscopic data of smgs with radio counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the majority ( @xmath2  75% ) of these radio - selected spectroscopically identified smgs host agn activity ; the other @xmath2  25% have x - ray properties consistent with star formation ( x - ray derived star - formation rates of @xmath2  13002700  yr@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agns have properties generally consistent with those of nearby luminous agns ( @xmath4 , @xmath5  @xmath6@xmath7  @xmath8 , and @xmath9  @xmath10@xmath11  erg  s@xmath3 ) and the majority ( @xmath2  80% ) are heavily obscured ( @xmath12  @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we construct composite rest - frame 220  kev spectra for three different obscuration classes ( @xmath13  @xmath8 , @xmath14  15  @xmath15  @xmath8 , and @xmath16  @xmath8 ) which reveal features not seen in the individual x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath2  1  kev equivalent width fe  k@xmath17 emission line is seen in the composite x - ray spectrum of the most heavily obscured agns , suggesting compton - thick or near compton - thick absorption . even taking into account the effects of absorption , we find that the average x - ray to far - infrared luminosity ratio of the agn - classified smgs ( @xmath18=  0.004 ) is approximately one order of magnitude below that found for typical quasars . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that intense star - formation activity ( of order @xmath2  1000  yr@xmath3 ) dominates the bolometric output of these smgs . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also explore the possibility that the x - ray to far - infrared luminosity ratio of the agn components is intrinsically less than that found for typical quasars and postulate that some smgs may be agn dominated . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the implications of our results for the growth of massive black holes , discuss the prospects for deeper x - ray observations , and explore the scientific potential offered by the next generation of x - ray observatories . </S>"
