    "in a previous paper of this symposium [ 14 ] we have discussed the induced representations of the euclidean group on the lattice via duality and fourier transform . in this paper",
    "we apply the same method to the induced representation of poincar group on the lattice .",
    "we explore the problem of irreducibility connected with the orbit condition , the assymptotic limit of the difference equation for the klein - gordon and dirac field .    in section 2 we present the realization of the integral lorentz transformation , that can be factorized completely with the help of kac generators , both for the fundamental and spin representation . in section 3",
    "we introduce several types of fourier transform that will be used to go from momentum to position space . in section 4",
    "we reproduce the properties of covariant bispinors in discrete momentum space in similar fashion to the continuous one . in section 5 , we elaborate the induced representation of poincar group on the lattice following standard procedure and we compare the results derived from the different types of fourier transform .",
    "a lorentz transformation is integral if leaves invariant the cubic lattice and at the same time keeps invariant the bilinear form @xmath2    according to coxeter [ 1 ] all integral lorentz transformations ( including reflections ) are obtained by combining the operations of permuting the spatial coordinates @xmath3 and changing the signs of any of the coordinates @xmath4 together with the operation of adding the quantity @xmath5 to each of the four coordinates of a point .    these operations can be described geometrically by the reflections on the plans perpendicular to the vectors @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an orthonormal basis .    in matritial form",
    "these reflections are    @xmath8    these reflections constitue a coxeter group , the dynkin diagram of which is the following        kac has proved [ 2 ] that @xmath9 generate all the integral lorentz tranformations that keep invariant the upper half of the light cone .    this result can be used to factorized any integral lorentz transformation that belong to the proper orthochronous group .",
    "let @xmath10 be an integral matrix of determinant + 1 , satisfying @xmath11 and also @xmath12 . from @xmath13",
    "it follows that only one of @xmath14 can be zero .",
    ". then we apply @xmath16 to @xmath17 from the left until @xmath14 become non - positive integers . to the resulting matrix",
    "we apply @xmath18 .",
    "we get @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "therefore @xmath22  or @xmath23    by iteration of the same algorithm we get @xmath24    the last inequality is a consequence of the fact that @xmath17 and @xmath18 belong to the complete lorentz group . following this process",
    "we get an integral matrix with @xmath25 which is a combination of @xmath16 , giving all the 24 elements of the cubic group on the lattice .",
    "therefore a general integral lorentz transformation of the proper orthochronos type @xmath17 can be decomposed as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 are the matrix which change sign of @xmath14 and @xmath28    a particular case of integral lorentz transformations are the boost or integral transformations of two inertial systems with relative velocity .",
    "the general expresion for these transformations can be obtained with the help of cayley parameters [ 3 ] .",

    "therefor we have to add all the integral lorentz matrix that applied to the vector @xmath35 gives all the integral vectors of the type @xmath37 with @xmath31 .",
    "this is equivalent to say that we apply to @xmath35 not only the matrix @xmath17 given by ( 8) but also its square root matrix , namely ,    @xmath38    in position space the space - time coordinates of the lattice @xmath39 are integer numbers .",
