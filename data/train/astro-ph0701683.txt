    "during the last decade the possibility that the expansion of our universe is accelerating has been put on a firm footing . the combined analysis of high redshift supernova data @xcite , along with observations of cosmic microwave background @xcite or large scale structure @xcite indicates a spatially flat universe with low matter density ( around one - third of the critical density ) , the rest of the closure density is believed to be in an unknown form generically termed as the _",
    "dark energy_. it is this component that drives the late time acceleration of the expansion of the universe .    the simplest possibility , which fits the data",
    "well , is that the acceleration is caused by the presence of a cosmological constant term , called the @xmath0 term .",
    "when combined with the usual matter term , the resultant model is referred to as the @xmath0cdm model . in this model",
    "the hubble parameter asymptotically approaches a constant at late times , thus causing the universe to accelerate .",
    "there are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that the dark energy density may not be a strict constant .",
    "there are several physical models where dark energy is generated dynamically from an evolving scalar field ( called quintessence ) or even from alternate theories of gravity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review of models and methods of reconstruction of cosmic history ) .",
    "due to its simplicity , it has become popular to phenomenologically model dark energy as an ideal fluid with an equation of state given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is allowed to be negative . in this model @xmath3",
    "gives the usual cosmological constant .",
    "models where @xmath2 is a constant or a simple function of redshift have also been considered .",
    "cosmological data is rapidly approaching a quality where we can start discriminating competing models of dark energy .",
    "the effect of tiny departures from a strict cosmological constant on observations is sufficiently small to render such analysis unreliable if the nature of statistical noise in data is not well understood .",
    "since the most detailed constraints on dark energy are derived from the luminosity distance to distant supernovae , we would like to be certain that their statistics is well understood .",
    "the central limit theorem @xcite ensures that , to a very good approximation , statistical noise due to a large number of random influences can be treated as gaussian .",
    "there are several possible sources of non - gaussianity in the supernova data ; according to @xcite these could be 1 ) statistical scatter due to location in the host galaxy and galaxy type 2 ) scatter due to dust absorption in the host galaxy , inter galactic medium or in our own galaxy or 3 ) due to lensing along the line of sight .",
    "some of these processes are corrected for in the data reduction .",
    "it is also possible that the observed anisotropy is a result of collation of data of disparate quality , perhaps due to differences in seeing condition or in the data reduction process .",
    "modern cosmology is based on the cosmological principle ( cp ) @xcite , which states that on the large scales the universe is statistically homogenous and isotropic . even if supernovae were perfect indicator of distance , and",
    "if statistical noise in the supernova distances is gaussian , an anisotropic universe could contribute a systematic , direction dependent modulation in the data .",
    "another possibility is that our galaxy could contain anisotropic , gray dust patches , and since the dust correction depends on reddening in the spectrum , this sort of dust could remain uncorrected . above",
    "arguments suggest that there is a strong case for investigating direction dependence in the supernova data .",
    "@xcite have investigated the possibility of detecting cosmic anisotropy with @xmath4 high-@xmath5 supernovae obtained from @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a different statistic than used by them .",
    "we use the gold data set containing @xmath6 supernovae @xcite for our analysis .",
    "although our methodology is derived from testing for isotropy , we shall use the term non - gaussianity interchangeably .",
    "our results can be interpreted as a systematic directional dependence in the data due to any of the above mentioned possibilities .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : method ] we describe our methodology in detail .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : results ] and our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "throughout our analysis we have assumed a flat frw universe .",
    "since @xmath0cdm model fits the data quite well , we first obtain the best fit model to the _ full gold data set _ @xcite and calculate the dispersion normalized residuals , where the distance modulus @xmath7 , the observed values being @xmath8 for a supernova at redshift @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the observed standard error .",
    "we shall consider subsets of the full data set to construct our statistic .",
    "we define the reduced @xmath11 in terms of @xmath12 as follows @xmath13 where it should be noted that by ` reduced ' we do not mean ` per degree of freedom ' , since we _ do not fit _ the model separately to the subsets of the full data . here",
    "@xmath11 is an indicator of the statistical scatter of the subset away from the best fit @xmath0cdm model .",
    "if cp holds then the apparent magnitude of a supernova should not depend upon the direction in which it is observed but only on the cosmology .",
    "we divide the data into two hemispheres labeled by the direction vector @xmath14 , and take the difference of the reduced @xmath11 computed for the two hemispheres separately to obtain @xmath15 , where we have defined north as that hemisphere towards which the direction vector @xmath14 points .",
    "we take the absolute value of @xmath16 , since that is the quantity which determines the plane across which data is anisotropic , and then vary the direction @xmath17 across the sky to obtain the maximum absolute difference @xmath18 to interpret our results we need to know what values of @xmath19 one might expect .",
    "the distribution of supernovae is not uniform on the sky , therefore , the number of supernovae in the two hemispheres for a given direction varies with the direction @xmath17 .",
    "therefore one might expect the probability distribution function @xmath20 to be extremely complicated , however , extreme value theory @xcite shows that the distribution is , in fact , a simple , two parameter gumbel distribution , characteristic of extreme value distribution type  i : @xmath21\\,\\exp\\left    [ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta - m}{s}\\right)\\right]\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where the position parameter @xmath22 and the scale parameter @xmath23 completely determine the distribution . to quantify departures from isotropy we need to know the theoretical distribution @xmath24 .",
    "since it is difficult to obtain it analytically , we have calculated it numerically by simulating several sets of gaussian distributed @xmath12 on the gold set supernova positions and obtaining @xmath19 from each realization .",
    "we plot this distribution in fig  [ fig1 ] as the broken curve .",
    "we find that the distribution closely resembles a gumbel distribution .",
    "if the data do have directional anisotropy then an independent possible test for non - gaussianity is obtained by constructing the bootstrap distribution @xmath25 in the following manner .",
    "the observed @xmath12 are assumed to be drawn from some unknown , direction dependent probability distribution .",
    "we shuffle the data values @xmath9 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 over the supernovae positions , thus destroying any directional alignment they might have had due to anisotropy .",
    "we show in the next section that this gives us yet another way of quantifying non - gaussianity .",
    "our main result is plotted in the fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we find that the theoretical distribution @xmath28 ( broken line ) assuming gaussian distributed @xmath12 indicates that our universe has about one sigma smaller anisotropy than the mean of the distribution .",
    "however , as mentioned in the last section , if the residuals @xmath8 are non - gaussian then a more appropriate estimate of departure from non - gaussianity would be the bootstrap distribution @xmath29 .",
    "we have plotted @xmath25 obtained by randomly shuffling @xmath12 on the given supernovae positions in the same figure .",
    "we find that the observed value of @xmath19 is more than one sigma away from the mean of this distribution as well .",
    "one problem with the bootstrap distribution is that we expect it to be shifted slightly to the left of the theoretical distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that theoretical distribution is obtained by assuming @xmath12 to be gaussian random variates with a zero mean and unit variance .",
    "therefore theoretical @xmath12s are unbounded .",
    "however , the bootstrap distribution is obtained by shuffling through a _ specific realization _ of @xmath12 , and they have a maximum value such that @xmath30 .",
    "since the bootstrap realizations have bounded @xmath12 , they should produce , on the average , slightly smaller values of @xmath19 as compared to what one expects from a gaussian distributed @xmath12 . for a large number of supernovae this bias is expected to vanish .",
    "since the gold data set contains only @xmath6 supernovae , another concern is that our statistics may not be reliable enough due to a lack of uniform sky coverage .",
    "we have made a few checks to investigate these concerns : we simulate the same number of supernovae as in the gold data set with randomly chosen positions on the sky .",
    "we then process the simulated data in exactly the same way as the actual data . a typical result is shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "there are a few things to be noted .",
    "1 ) the simulated data gives a @xmath19 that is consistent with the theoretical distribution , indicating that a uniform sky coverage is not a strict requirement in this statistic .",
    "2 ) the theoretical and bootstrap distributions for the simulated data look identical in shape and 3 ) the peak of the bootstrap distribution is shifted leftwards , as discussed above .",
    "this shift is on the order of @xmath31 per cent . in fig  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show that the bootstrap distribution has a mean that is about @xmath32 per cent shifted from the theoretical distribution , and has a _ different shape _ , independently indicating non - gaussianity .",
    "the excess shift can not be reconciled with the theoretical distribution by a simple scaling of the error bars . to produce a rightward shift",
    "we would need to increase @xmath19 , which can be done by decreasing the error bars on supernovae by a constant scale factor .",
    "however , this would also produce a larger @xmath33 for the best fit @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the data actually gives @xmath34 , and scaling would make it larger , thus making the primary fit worse .",
    "we find that the gold set is maximally asymmetric in the direction @xmath35 .",
    "we designate the two hemispheres as ` hot ' or ` cold ' according to largeness or smallness of their reduced @xmath11 ( as given in eq .",
    "[ eq : chisq ] ) with respect to the best fit @xmath0cdm model . in fig  [ fig3 ]",
    "we have plotted the residuals @xmath36 for the hot and cold subsets of supernovae .",
    "the zero line is the best fit @xmath0cdm model .",
    "as expected , the cold supernovae show slightly smaller dispersion compared to the hot ones .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] also shows that the @xmath0cdm model seems to fit the hot and cold supernovae equally well .",
    "this is borne out by a parameter estimation , which is tabulated in table  [ tbl-1 ] , where we find that the best fit @xmath0cdm model for hot supernovae gives @xmath37 and the cold ones give @xmath38 , so the difference is only a few per cent . however , the situation is not the same for model where we have assumed a constant equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the model parameters for the hot supernovae in this model are @xmath39 with @xmath40 and for the cold supernovae @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the value of the hubble constant is relatively quite robust , showing that most of the effect is coming from high-@xmath5 supernovae .",
    "the large difference in the values for the constant @xmath2 model shows that the level of non - gaussianity indicates that constraints on a more complicated dark energy model are not as robust .",
    "perhaps this explains the intriguing result in @xcite , that the data seems to fit a @xmath0cdm model as well as a model with a strongly evolving dark energy .",
    "we have used the extreme value statistics on the gold data set and shown the presence of non - gaussian features in the data .",
    "we find that there is a direction of maximal asymmetry in the data across which data seems to imply different cosmological models for a constant equation of state , although , the constraints on the @xmath0cdm model are found to be robust .",
    "we have discussed how this could either imply non - gaussianity in the data due to various possible physical processes or due to anisotropy in the universe .",
    "our results can not be trivially understood by scaling the error bars . since",
    "this analysis has been done within the framework of an frw model , it is obviously very difficult to quantify the precise meaning of this anisotropy .",
    "we have discussed that we need to be very careful in interpreting dark energy beyond the cosmological constant model since it is possible that systematic noise may masquerade as evolving dark energy .",
    "further work is required to fully understand the statistic that we have introduced in our analysis and will be discussed in greater detail in a future publication .",
