    "it is hoped that signatures of the processes that took place at that time will be visible in the universe today , for instance , in primordial perturbations or other relics of the very early universe .",
    "recently models for the early universe have become less ad - hoc and more inspired from string theory @xcite .",
    "the brane world model is particularly attractive , since it contains the ingredients for a successful inflationary universe .",
    "the separation of a brane and an antibrane can act as an inflaton field , and the interaction of the pair allows one to calculate the corresponding inflaton potential .",
    "the collision and annihilation of the brane - antibrane pair provides a natural mechanism for ending inflation and reheating the universe",
    ".    one important prediction of a large class of brane inflation models is the formation of topological defects , typically networks of cosmic strings  it has been argued @xcite that brane - anti - brane annihilation in the very early universe leads to the formation of cosmic strings only [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "the formation of topological defects in brane - anti - brane annihilation has been well studied in string theory and field theory @xcite , and represents a particularly testable potential signature for these models , since the defect network can have quite different properties from that of conventional cosmic string networks @xcite .",
    "the discovery of explicit mechanisms for the stabilization of the compact extra dimensions makes this class of models even more appealing for phenomenology @xcite .",
    "these types of models have been mainly used to describe the inflationary universe , and the predictions these models make for the cosmological parameters can already be tested against the experimental data . at the same time , the mechanism that stabilizes the compactification poses additional challenges since it can make the topological defects unstable .",

    "one usually considers only the complex tachyon field or can include the @xmath0 gauge field that couples to the tachyon .",
    "bulk fields are usually neglected .",
    "however , it has been argued in @xcite that the inclusion of the bulk fields in the process of defect formation substantially changes the dynamics of defect formation , leading to a strong suppression of the defect formation rate .",
    "this is because the topological defects are themselves branes , so they couple to fields described by closed string modes , namely the dilaton and the ramond - ramond fields which propagate in the entire bulk space - time @xcite .",
    "the energy of the gradients of the rr field along the compactified extra dimensions is large , so the formation of defects is strongly suppressed .",
    "more precisely , it was argued that desitter quantum fluctuations can not account for the formation of lower dimensional branes since the typical energy of the quantum fluctuations is of order the hubble constant @xmath1 while the gradients of the fields spreading in the extra dimensions of size @xmath2 are of the order @xmath3 . during brane inflation @xmath4 , so the formation of lower dimensional branes is suppressed .    in this paper",
    "we try to analyze the mechanism of defect formation when bulk fields are involved .",
    "we first construct a toy model which captures the essential features of the full 10-dimensional model that are responsible for the formation of the topological defects . using this toy model we study the classical evolution of the brane and bulk fields , so the desitter quantum fluctuations are responsible only for seeding perturbations which grow during the subsequent evolution .",
    "the final configuration of the bulk field gradients is a result of this classical evolution .",
    "the energy of the system comes from tension of the brane - anti - brane pair , which can be modeled as the potential energy of the tachyon field sitting at the top of the potential . in our toy model",
    "this corresponds to the potential energy of a complex scalar living in the worldvolume of the brane - anti - brane pair .",
    "we will present the sugra lagrangian for the fields which live both inside the worldvolume of the brane - anti - brane system and the bulk , and we will construct a toy model with the same physical features .",
    "we will evolve the equations of motion of this toy model on a lattice and observe the formation of the defects .",
    "we will analyze the effect the coupling to the bulk fields has on the formation process as well as the characteristics of the defects once they are formed .    in section 2 we present the relevant supergravity lagrangian and the toy model we use . in section 3",

    "details of the lattice implementation of our toy model are left to a technical appendix .",
    "the usual approach to defect formation during tachyon condensation is to take into account only the fields that live in the worldvolume of the decaying non - bps brane or brane - anti - brane pair .",
    "this approach seems to be motivated by the fact that the resulting lower - dimensional branes formed during the decay are localized inside the worldvolume of the parent brane .",
    "however , the final state defects are themselves d - branes , and therefore couple to bulk rr - fields .",
    "one should include the effects of these fields in the defect formation process .",
    "when studying the formation of topological defects by the brane worldvolume fields only , one usually considers a single non - bps brane with the action : [ single_non_bps ] s =- t_pd^p+1x e^-v(t ) , where @xmath5 $ ] represents the pull - back of the bulk metric and ns - ns two - form field on the brane and @xmath6 is the field strength of the abelian world - volume gauge field @xcite .",
    "this action was used extensively to study the evolution of the tachyon field in various special settings .",
    "the most common one is the spatially uniform field in a friedmann - robertson - walker universe . in this case",
    "one usually sets the ns - ns two - form field and the brane gauge field to vanish everywhere , and study the time evolution of the tachyon field and scale factor of the universe .",
    "the uniform field does not lead to the formation of defects , it behaves like a pressureless fluid known as `` tachyon matter '' @xcite .",
    "when studying the formation of topological defects during tachyon condensation , one usually chooses a flat metric , sets the ns - ns field and the brane gauge field to vanish everywhere , but chooses a tachyon field that is both time and space dependent .",
    "the equation of motion for the tachyon field , - - = 0 , is non - linear , and one usually solves the equation around a point where @xmath7 .",
    "there the space and time dependence can be approximated by a linear space profile with a time - dependent slope , @xmath8 , and the resulting equation for @xmath9 can be solved .",
    "the solution becomes singular in finite time , the occurrence of the singularity marking the formation of the topological defect .",
    "this result confirms the string theory calculation in which a linear tachyon profile @xmath10 reproduces the correct tension of a codimension one brane in the limit @xmath11 .    the brane gauge field is usually included in the form of a uniform background electric field @xcite or a constant gauge potential ( wilson line ) @xcite .",
    "the case where both the brane gauge field and a worldvolume scalar field other than the tachyon are included was studied in @xcite .",
    "this action is highly non - linear and in order to perform a lattice regularization we prefer an expression in which the square - root is expanded to quadratic order in the field strengths . also for a single non - bps brane",
    "the tachyon is a real scalar which can not be minimally coupled to the world - volume gauge field .",
    "it is therefore more convenient to consider the action for a brane - anti - brane pair . in the case of a @xmath12 pair",
    "the expanded action involving the complex tachyon coupled to the gauge fields living inside each brane is given in ref .",
    "@xcite : s&=&2t_d9d^10x e^- e^-2^t .",
    "the two gauge fields live in the worldvolume of each brane and the tachyon field couples only with one linear combination : d_t = _ t-(a_^+-a_^-)t .    the brane fields couple with the ramond - ramond ( rr ) bulk fields through the chern - simons coupling also given in ref .",
    "@xcite : s^d_rr = t_d9ce^2i ^f .",
    "one can expand the exponential above , and the leading order coupling between the brane fields and the bulk rr field involves the same linear combination of brane gauge fields that couples to the tachyon : s^d_rr=2^t_d9 c_p-1(f^+-f^- ) we see that the orthogonal linear combination , @xmath13 does not couple to any other fields , so we will drop it from the action . including the kinetic terms for the rr field , the dilaton and the metric , the 10-dimensional action describing the decay of the brane - anti - brane pair is : & & s= d^10x + & & -2t_d9d^10x e^- e^-2^t , where @xmath14 is the corresponding field strength for the potential @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath15 will be the only field we consider here , we will not include the dilaton and the metric in the toy model we consider .",
    "we want to create the simplest toy model which captures the important features of the formation of defects with bulk fields included , and at the same time is amenable to a lattice regularization .",
    "this will allow us to follow the evolution to see whether defects form , and how the interactions with the bulk fields affect that formation .",
    "we want to include the minimal field content that will allow us to study the formation of the defects , so we will not include the metric and dilaton fields present in the full 10-dimensional model .",
    "since we want to study the formation of codimension 2 defects the brane must have at least 2 spatial dimensions , so we will choose a 2 + 1 dimensional brane .",
    "the defects that form are 0 + 1-dimensional and the corresponding bulk field that couples to their worldvolume must carry a single index .",
    "therefore we will have a vector field living in the bulk .",
    "this field corresponds to the @xmath15 rr field in the 10-dimensional model .",
    "we choose the bulk to have the minimal space dimensionality , 1 space dimension more than the brane . inside the brane we put the same field content as in the full 10-dimensional model , an abelian gauge field corresponding to the linear combination @xmath17 and a complex scalar field corresponding to the complex tachyon @xmath18 .",

    "it is straightforward to derive the equations of motion which follow from this action .",

    "one usually chooses the lorentz gauge @xmath33 to further simplify the equation above .",
    "this can be convenient when solving for a static , isolated defect , but is not the most convenient one when performing lattice simulations .",

    "far from the vortex , the fields are locally in vacuum and",
    "all excitations are massive ; so the mutual interactions of two vortices or a vortex - antivortex pair are exponentially suppressed with separation .",

    ", we will determine the force between defects , which will no longer fall off exponentially .",
    "the force will be attractive between defects of opposite winding number , but repulsive between defects of the same winding number ; our toy model does not include the dilaton and the graviton fields , which can provide compensating attractive interaction , so we can not obtain the bps states that correspond to two identical , parallel , branes .",
    "one can perform a kaluza - klein reduction of the 3 + 1 dimensional bulk theory down to 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this will yield a theory containing a light @xmath19 and @xmath29 field and a massless @xmath31 field , together with a kaluza - klein tower of heavier @xmath31 field modes .",
    "it is possible to solve for the defect structure using this effective theory .",
    "since the brane fields are directly the fields appearing in the 2 + 1d effective theory , their equations of motion change the least .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath19 is unchanged , and the expression for @xmath44 , , is changed only by the replacing @xmath1 with a sum over kk states of @xmath1 from each kk state .",
    "the change for the bulk field @xmath31 is slightly more complicated .",
    "the kk decomposition is a fourier series expansion , so @xmath45 in @xmath46 space becomes the constant @xmath47 in each kk mode .",

    "we will not attempt to solve these equations in detail near the defect core , but will content ourselves with an understanding of the defect appearance at radii larger than the symmetry breaking scale , @xmath49 , and larger than the radius of the extra dimension , @xmath50 . in this case , the appearance of @xmath51 in the equation for @xmath52 leads to an exponential decay of @xmath42 away from the defect core for all kk states but the zero mode , which instead falls according to the 2d coulomb s law : [ eq_c ] c^0 ( ) & = & ( /_0 ) , + & & ddf_12 = da _ , where @xmath53 represents the total magnetic flux associated with the brane defect , and @xmath54 is a constant of integration .",
    "physically , the charge distribution for the @xmath31 field is a disk lying on the brane at the defect core , but the @xmath1 electric field spreads out from this disk and becomes uniform across the extra dimension at a distance of a few @xmath2 , as illustrated by the cartoon in figure [ fig_cartoon ] .",
    "unlike the case of vanishing @xmath55 , the magnetic flux @xmath53 will not equal @xmath56 .",
    "there are two ways to see this ; by considering the equations of motion , or by considering energetics .",
    "looking first at the field equations , the requirement that the scalar field phase change by @xmath36 around the defect is topological and is not modified by the chern - simons term .",
    "however , the presence of the chern - simons term in means that either the field strength or the higgs field current must now be nonzero .",
    "the defect core is defined as the region where the gauge field strength is non - negligible ; outside the core we expect @xmath57 , so only the higgs field gradient term can balance the chern - simons term",
    ". this will happen if the gauge field is smaller than @xmath58 ( its value in the nielsen - olesen solution ) , corresponding to a flux which is smaller than @xmath59 , because in this case the derivative and gauge field parts of the covariant derivative @xmath60 will not cancel when acting on @xmath61 . in detail , the equation of motion becomes , ig_brane^2 ( d_^ * - ^ * d _ ) & = & c_cs g^2_brane _ c^0 , + ( n - a_/ ) & = & c_cs , where we used in the second line . solving for @xmath53 , remembering that @xmath62 , we find , v^2 ( n - ) & = & ( ) , + & = & 2n ^-1 .",
    "alternatively , we can understand this result by considering energetics .",
    "if the gauge field flux does not equal @xmath36 , there will be a nonvanishing higgs field gradient energy .",
    "however , the larger the flux , the larger the @xmath31 electric field .",
    "the vortex is the minimal energy configuration subject to the topolocial condition on the phase of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the gauge field will take the value which minimizes the sum of these two energy densities ; ( d_^ * d_+ _ c^0 _ c^0 ) = 0 . in the first term , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( since otherwise there would be an extensive potential energy ) . in the second term",
    ", @xmath42 is determined from .",
    "also , @xmath65 , as previously .",
    "the minimization therefore requires , = 0 = 2n ^-1 , the same answer we obtained directly from the equations of motion .",
    "this calculation also allows us to find the energy density far from the brane core , which is , = | d_|^2 + |c^0|^2 , which using the above result for @xmath53 equals , = , a .",
    "note several features of this energy density .",
    "first and most important , it falls off as @xmath66 as one increases the distance @xmath67 from the core of the defect .",
    "second , as the chern - simons coupling @xmath55 is changed from 0 to @xmath68 , the energy density far from the core changes smoothly from 0 , the value for a `` local '' ( abelian higgs ) topological defect , to @xmath69 , the value for a `` global '' topological defect ( one for a complex , gauge singlet scalar field ) .",
    "the total energy of a defect , @xmath70 , is logarithmically divergent ; e = d d = v^2 n^2 _ max/ _ min .",
    "[ eq : tot_energy ] here @xmath71 is a constant of integration which also absorbs the finite contribution from the defect core , and @xmath72 is the distance where interactions with the fields of other defects become important .",
    "for instance , for a defect - antidefect pair of separation @xmath73 , the energy is @xmath74 ) \\ln",
    "r/\\rho_{\\rm min}$ ] .",
    "this behavior shows that a defect antidefect pair will feel an attractive @xmath75 interaction , which is proportional to @xmath76 when the chern - simons coupling is small but has a finite limit when it is large .",
    "the chern - simons term has replaced the exponentially weak long - range interaction with one more typical of coulomb interactions in two dimensions .",
    "one feature of is that the energy associated with a defect is never larger than the energy of a global defect , that is , a defect without either the brane field @xmath29 or the bulk field @xmath31 .",
    "we have shown this for the large distance contribution , but it is also true in the core ; for while the bulk field @xmath31 costs energy , it only does so if the gauge field @xmath29 takes on a nonvanishing flux .",
    "the energetics are that the flux is present because it reduces the scalar field gradients , and it will always take a value which reduces the scalar gradients more than it increases field strength energies . therefore the energetics of defect formation are at least as favorable as in a global defect model . also note that the _ larger _ the extra bulk dimension , the _ smaller _ the parameter @xmath77 and therefore the energy , as the @xmath42 field strength spreads out over a larger dimension and therefore carries a smaller field strength squared .",
    "we can now understand why a network of defects is energetically permitted to form in the process of brane - antibrane annihilation , which is assumed to start with the tachyon field near zero .",
    "the analogous situation in the toy model is that the scalar field starts at zero , though with small quantum fluctuations away from zero .",
    "consider an isolated defect , hypothetically formed after brane - anti - brane annihilation .",
    "there is a finite contribution to its energy from the defect core region , and a contribution arising from large @xmath67 , which grows like @xmath78 .",
    "however , inside the same radius , the potential energy initially available from the the scalar field grows like the area , @xmath79 , and this always wins over the @xmath78 dependence .",
    "we can therefore conclude that for a large enough radius , @xmath67 , there is always enough energy available for creating the defect .",
    "the reason is that the energy of the final defect is coming from the potential energy of the brane scalar field , or the tachyon in the string theory case , and not from the quantum desitter fluctuations .",
    "this study has clarified the behavior of defects in the toy model and argued that their formation is not obstructed by energetic considerations .",
    "we now will verify these conclusions , and study the dynamics of the formation and evolution of the system of vortices which forms in brane - antibrane annihilation in this toy model , by studying it via nonperturbative lattice techniques .",
    "the previous section established a toy model and made preliminary investigations of the defect structure and energetics in this model .",
    "what we really want is to study the dynamics of this model and its defect formation in a nonperturbative way .",
    "therefore we have implemented the toy model on the lattice . excluding the chern - simons coupling , which will be presented in an appendix , the lattice regularization of the brane and bulk action is the usual one for an abelian higgs model in @xmath80 dimensions and a abelian gauge field in @xmath81 dimensions .",
    "the fact that the fields are abelian allows us to use the non - compact formulation of the lattice action .",
    "the lattice equations of motion are most easily evolved in temporal gauge , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this choice is immaterial so long as we concentrate on gauge invariant observables .",
    "it makes it slightly harder to verify the field configuration for the vortex discussed in the previous section , since the two configurations are related by a time - dependent gauge transformation .",
    "however , we can still compare lattice studies to our results there using only gauge invariant quantities such as field strengths .",
    "in particular , defects are easily identified by the peak of magnetic field strength at their core , along with the peak in energy density .",
    "besides studying the static vortex solutions , the lattice implementation allows us to study the dynamical evolution of the fields , including the formation and annihilation of the vortices and the flow of energy from the brane into the bulk .",
    "the goal of the simulations is to see whether defects form , and how the defect network subsequently evolves if they do form , when the fields are prepared in a state designed to mimic the initial state of the tachyon field right after a brane collision .",
    "namely , we begin with vanishing gauge fields @xmath84 , and with the scalar field @xmath19 at the unstable symmetric point @xmath39 . to simulate initial vacuum fluctuations ,",
    "we add small fluctuations in the scalar field .",
    "these will grow unstably , triggering the phase transition to the state where @xmath85 almost everywhere .",

    "the total energy of the defect pair grows smaller as the extra dimension becomes larger .",

    "as the two defects approach each other there is an increase in the energy of the brane fields and a decrease of the one in the bulk field .",
    "the decrease in the bulk field energy is due to the fact that the pair of charges at small separation will generate a dipole field at large distances and this field has a lower total energy than two widely separated charges .",

    "one of the complications of a symmetry breaking transition such as the one we are studying is , that the extra energy density associated with the initial field potential energy has to `` go somewhere '' during the simulation . frequently people carry out such simulations using dissipative dynamics , meaning the extra energy is eaten up by friction .",

    "as expected ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) , for a weak coupling the energy is transferred slowly to the bulk , so the brane fields have more time available to homogenize .",
    "however as the strength of the coupling is increased the energy transfer rate reaches a maximum , and then it decreases again .",
    "we can understand this effect if we take into account the fact that the magnetic flux of the brane gauge field acts as the electric charge for the bulk gauge field .",
    "we saw before that when increasing the strength of the coupling the charge increases .",
    "however , when the charge becomes too large , it becomes energetically expensive for brane magnetic fields to appear at all ; therefore a very large chern - simons interaction simply prevents brane magnetic fields from taking large values , turning off the mechanism available for exchange of energy between brane and bulk .",
    "previous studies of defect formation during tachyon condensation have neglected the role played by bulk fields . it was argued @xcite that when bulk fields are included , the formation of topological defects is suppressed or prevented .",
    "the argument was that the energy of the desitter fluctuations is of the order the hubble constant during inflation , while the gradients of the fields along the compact dimensions have corresponding energies @xmath94 ; so there is not enough energy available for defect formation .",
    "we have constructed a toy model that captures the essential features of the tachyon condensation process when both the brane worldvolume gauge field and the bulk rr field are included . in this model",
    "the gradients of the bulk field are formed as a result of classical field evolution and the energy is provided by the tension of the brane - anti - brane pair . since this energy can also be described as the energy of the tachyon field placed at the top of the potential , in the toy model this corresponds to the potential energy of an abelian higgs field .",
    "we argued that inside a large enough area around a defect there is always enough energy in the form of potential energy of the scalar field such that there is no energetic constraint on the formation of topological defects .    in terms of energetics ,",
    "the presence of the bulk with a chern - simons coupling increases the energy cost of a defect .",
    "the increase is greatest if the chern - simons coupling is large and if the extra dimension is _",
    "small_. however , the energy associated with a defect never exceeds the value in the global defect model , that is , the value it would take if there were no gauge field or if @xmath95 . the bulk field also changes the long range interactions between defects , so that their mutual attraction or repulsion shows power law , rather than exponential , dependence on separation .",
    "this speeds up the evolution of the defect network , so that defect - antidefect pairs find each other and annihilate more efficiently .",
    "again , the defect network evolution is never faster than in the global defect model , which is known to support a defect network after a symmetry breaking transition .",
    "another effect we observe in the lattice simulations of the toy model is the decrease of the magnetic flux unit through the vortex core as a function of the chern - simons coupling constant .",
    "this flux also acts as the charge density for the bulk field and if the chern - simons coupling becomes too large this charge density becomes very small , reducing the energy leakage from the brane to the bulk .",
    "one drawback of the toy model comes from using an abelian higgs field instead of a tachyon on the brane .",
    "we did this so that we could follow the evolution of the defects after they have formed while the tachyon develops singularities .",
    "at the same time the brane fields do not drop out of the dynamics @xcite once the defects have formed .",
    "we would like to thank a. vilenkin and j. j. blanco - pillado for collaboration during the early stages of this work .",
    "this work is supported by grants from nserc of canada and fqrnt of qubec .",
    "here we expand the chern - simons coupling of the brane and bulk fields to second order in @xmath96 .",
    "the full expression is s^d_rr = t_d9ce^2i ^f , where c = _",
    "p= c__0  _pdx^_0  dx^_p .",
    "the supertrace of the matrix is defined as , m = (    cc1&0 + 0&-1    ) m , and @xmath97 is the curvature of the superconnection , given by if = (    cc if^+-t&d + dt&if^--t    ) .",
    "here we are interested in the particular case of codimension 2 defects , so the relevant coupling will be with the @xmath15 rr - field that couples with the defects .",
    "we want to keep both the tachyon and the gauge fields non - zero , so we will expand the exponential inside the supertrace in powers of @xmath96 : e^2i ^f & = & (    cc1&0 + 0&-1    ) + ( 2^ ) (    cc1&0 + 0&-1    ) (    ccif^+-t&d + dt&if^--t    ) + & & + (    cc1&0 + 0&-1    ) (    ccif^+-t&d + dt&if^--t    ) (    ccif^+-t&d + dt&if^--t    ) + & & +  + & = & ( 2i^)+ [ supertrace ] + & & ( 2^)^2 +  .",
    "the terms of the type @xmath98 couple with @xmath99 and count only in the formation of codimension 4 defects .",
    "therefore , in the case of a @xmath12 pair , the important couplings between the brane and the bulk fields are t_d9-ic_8\\ { ( 2i^)+ ( 2^)^2 } .",
    "since we are interested in the simplest model which involves such a coupling , when we construct the toy model we keep only the interaction that corresponds to the leading term in @xmath96 , ( 2^)t_d9c_8 .",
    "we can extend the toy model we used to a higher dimensional one which will have fewer differences with respect to the full string - theory model .",
    "the most straightforward generalization would be to consider a @xmath81-dimensional brane and a @xmath100 dimensional bulk .",
    "the field content of the worldvolume theory would still be the abelian higgs model , but the bulk field will now be a rank-2 antisymmetric tensor field , which has the appropriate rank to couple to the 2-dimensional world - volume of a string .",
    "the abelian higgs model in @xmath81 dimensions admits stable string - like defects which in our model will be charged under the bulk field .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is : = _",

    "if we now want to study how the solution for a nielsen - olesen string is modified by the presence of the bulk field , for the brane fields we make the usual ansatz for a string placed along the @xmath46-direction : far from the string the scalar and gauge fields are ( r ) = v e^in , a_(r ) = z , with @xmath46 a rescaling of the @xmath101 case which remains to be determined .",
    "we observe that for the bulk field only the @xmath102 component is sourced by the chern - simons term .",
    "the entire analysis done for the lowest - dimensional toy model can be applied here with the only difference being the expression of the masses for the kk modes , wich will be highly dependent on the details of the compactification . for the simplest case , a torus ,",
    "the expression is : m_kk^2 = _",
    "however , when studying the energetics of the defects , only the zero mode gives a potentially log - divergent contribution , and the details of the compactification are relevant only to an energy density associated with the core .",
    "also , as in the toy model studied in the main text , the ( global ) defect with the @xmath19 field varying by a @xmath56 phase around the defect core but both the @xmath103 and @xmath1 field strengths vanishing gives an upper bound on the defect energetics .",
    "as in the lowest - dimensional toy model we have : c^03 ( ) & = & ( /_0 ) , + & & ddf_12 = da _ , with @xmath104 the ( 6-dimensional ) volume of the compact manifold .",
    "this leads to the same result for the unit of magnetic flux through the vortex core : = 2n ^-1 , and for the energetics of the defect ; the string tension involves a log , @xmath105 , with @xmath72 the inter - string separation and @xmath106 the string core size ; t = v^2 n^2 _ max/_min , a .",
    "we could also have considered higher dimensional branes wrapped on cycles of the compact manifold , but again only the zero modes of the brane fields would participate in the formation of the defects .",
    "the easiest setup to study the formation of defects in the original theory is to consider the action for a brane - anti - brane pair for only the tachyon field in flat space - time , with all the other fields turned off , since the lower - dimensional branes are in fact vortices of the complex tachyon field .",
    "the action is simply : s = 2t_d9d^10x e^-2^t .",
    "one can also consider the action for lower - dimensional brane - anti - brane pairs .",

    "these results allow us to obtain an upper limit for the density of defects formed , based only on energetic considerations .",
    "the brane tension is equal to the mass per unit volume for the brane and the result @xmath116 tells us that we can have at most one defect on each patch of area @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the string length .",
