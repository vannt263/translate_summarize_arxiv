    "for many years effective chiral models have been used to calculate properties of nucleons and baryons .",
    "we have in mind theories like the skyrme model , the nambu - jona - lasinio and chiral quark soliton approach , chiral and cloudy bag models , etc . in most of the cases the calculations",
    "are restricted to su(2 ) and hedgehog structures are assumed for the pionic field . if one treats under those conditions the system properly one can always manage that the pion field of the baryon shows in the asymptotic region a yukawa tail with a mass parameter corresponding to the physical pion mass of @xmath0  mev .",
    "this seems to be a realistic picture and indeed many very successful calculations for electromagnetic and axial form factors and static properties of the nucleon and the delta - isobar have been performed ( see review article  @xcite ) .",
    "problems arise , however , if one likes to include effects of strange quarks .",
    "in contrast to up- and down - quarks , which have a current mass of about 5 - 10  mev , strange quarks have a current mass of about 180  mev .",
    "so one would expect the corresponding meson field , i.e. the kaon field , to have a yukawa tail corresponding to the physical kaon mass of @xmath1  mev . for most of the hedgehog models , however , it is not possible to have the radial dependence of the tail of the kaon field different from that of the pion field .",
    "the reason is obvious : one generally uses a so - called trivial embedding of su(2 ) into su(3 ) and treats the current mass difference perturbatively . in the semiclassical quantization of the system",
    "the kaon field appears then as a rotational excitation of the pion field in the strange direction and hence the kaon field inherits automatically the radial dependence of the pion field .",
    "in fact only the absolute magnitude of these fields might be different .",
    "this is probably justified for many observables and indeed calculations of this sort were often very successful .",
    "there are , however , observables which intuitively should depend noticeably on a proper treatment of the kaon tail like e.g. the strange form factor of the nucleon and the electric form factor of the neutron .",
    "both quantities are experimentally extremely interesting and hence a proper theoretical description is highly searched for .",
    "actually there are other formalisms like the one of callan and klebanov , which treats pions and kaons on quite different footing , but there are only few realistic applications and no form factors have been calculated yet .",
    "it is therefore the objective of the present paper , to formulate one of the above mentioned models , i.e. the chiral quark soliton model with hedgehog configuration , in a way which allows to identify clearly the mesonic clouds and their contribution to a form factor and to provide a formalism , which takes care that the mesonic clouds have a proper asymptotic behavior , i.e. that the yukawa tail of the pion field falls off with the physical pion mass and that of the kaon field with the physical kaon mass .",
    "this will eventually lead to a so - called hybrid method in which the neutron and proton electric form factors will be evaluated .",
    "we shall see that the proper treatment of both pion and kaon tails will modify the theoretical neutron form factor noticeably and will bring it much closer to experiment .",
    "the present study requires a formalism , which allows to identify the contribution of the mesonic clouds to a certain observable .",
    "the mesonic clouds originate in the chiral quark soliton model from the polarization of the dirac sea .",
    "another equally important contribution originates from the valence quarks .",
    "while the sea quarks give rise to mesonic components the contribution of the valence quarks can be disentangled into bare baryonic component which form together with the corresponding mesonic component the total nucleon .",
    "thus one has basically two seemingly different pictures . in one ( soliton picture )",
    "the nucleon consists of valence quarks and polarized sea quarks , adiabatically rotating in space in order to give the soliton the proper quantum numbers . in the other ( baryon - meson picture ) the nucleon consists of a bare nucleon plus a delta coupled with a pion plus a hyperon coupled with a kaon , etc . usually these pictures coexist without much connection between them .",
    "the present formalism tries to build a bridge between both pictures by identifying the meson - baryon components in the soliton .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : in section  [ sov ] we will shortly review the vacuum sector and the fixing of the parameters of the chiral quark soliton model ( nonlinear nambu  jona - lasinio model ) . in section  [ effon ]",
    "we will present the formalism for the calculation of the electric form factor of the nucleon , as far it is needed for the further discussions .",
    "we will introduce the so - called meson expansion in order to identify the contributions of the meson clouds to the form factors and to disentangle the baryonic contributions of the valence quarks . in section  [ hpm ]",
    "we shall identify the yukawa tails of the soliton and discuss their dependence on the current quark masses .",
    "numerical calculations of the neutron electric form factor and of the nucleon strange form factor are given in section  [ effwspm ] .",
    "we furthermore suggest the so - called hybrid method which estimates the effect of having proper yukawa tails for both pions and kaons . a summary and outlook concludes the paper in section  [ sum ] .",
    "some details of the formalisms are given in the appendix .",
    "we have several parameters in the chiral quark soliton ( @xmath2qs ) model . to fix them we investigate meson properties in the vacuum .",
    "this investigation have already been made by many authors , summarized in a recent review by christov _",

    "et al . _ have employed the linear - bosonized - njl lagrangian where the scalar meson exists as well as the pseudo - scalar meson . however , in the @xmath2qs model the nucleon is constructed by the valence quarks interacting with the `` goldstone '' bosons which correspond to an angle of the spherical coordinate in the space spanned by scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons .",
    "therefore , to make calculations consistent , one should investigate the structure of the vacuum according to the `` goldstone '' bosons .",
    "wakamatsu and yoshiki did this investigation in su(2 ) flavor space . in this section",
    "we repeat it , but in su(3 ) flavor space .    the @xmath2qs model is derived based on the instanton picture of the qcd vacuum  @xcite and is described by the partition function with a very simple qcd effective action , in which quarks interact via goldstone bosons : @xmath3 where the @xmath4 is the lagrangian of quarks interacting with goldstone bosons described by the chiral meson field @xmath5 : @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",

    "the lowest order of the meson expansion of the sea quark loop is with two meson legs as shown in eq.([expsea ] ) .",
    "hence we can parameterize the mesonic clouds using @xmath219 we see that both of the pionic and kaonic clouds are parameterized with the same hedgehog pion mass @xmath168 and this is equal to the pion mass @xmath0  mev .",
    "this is due to the following reason . in the saddle point approximation which we use to calculate form factors",

    "the hedgehog pion mass @xmath168 is exactly the same as the pion mass : @xmath220  mev .",
    "hence in fig.[fig - msc ] the tail of the kaonic cloud is characterized by the pion mass .",

    "we show also the neutron electric charge density calculated with @xmath74  mev and @xmath218 in fig.[fig - npl ] .",
    "the kaonic cloud has a big strength even in the large distance region and suppresses the pion cloud strongly . in table",
    "[ tab - ner ] we show the neutron electric charge radius : @xmath221 in su(2 ) the neutron electric charge radius is dominated by the sea quark contribution ( pionic cloud effect ) and its absolute value is overestimated . on the other hand in su(3 ) the valence quark contribution is not tiny compared to su(2 ) .",
    "it is caused by the contributions from hyperon components .",
    "furthermore we have also the kaonic cloud contribution and , finally , the absolute value of neutron electric charge radius is underestimated in su(3 ) ( with @xmath218 ) . to solve this problem",

    "the calculation with @xmath228 gives remarkably smaller form factor than the case of @xmath218 . in table",
    "[ tab - ser ] we also show the strange electric radius : @xmath229 the sea quark contribution in the case of @xmath228 is quite smaller than in the case of @xmath218 while the valence quark contribution in both cases is almost the same . here",
    "we would like to mention that the kaonic cloud has the yukawa tail and , therefore , one can expect that the radius is proportional to the inverse of the yukawa mass .",
    "in fact the ratio of radii in cases of @xmath218 and @xmath228 is : @xmath230 using this improvement of the kaonic cloud we calculate now the neutron electric form factor .",
    "the neutron electric charge distribution is constructed by the valence quark contribution and the contributions from pionic and kaonic clouds .",
    "apparently there is a dilemma : we know from the discussions in this paper that both the pionic and kaonic clouds are important for the neutron electric form factor .",
    "however , if we use @xmath218 ( @xmath188 ) the pion tail is right and kaon tail is wrong .",
    "if we calculate the neutron electric form factor in su(3 ) with @xmath228 ( @xmath224  mev ) to improve the kaonic cloud effect , the pionic cloud effect would not be properly produced .",
    "hence we apply the following approximation .",
    "first , we calculate the neutron electric form factor in su(2 ) with @xmath218 : @xmath231 . in the @xmath231",
    "we have only a good description of the pionic cloud .",
    "however the pionic cloud effect is not enough to reproduce the neutron electric form factor as we discussed already . to get the kaonic cloud effect we need to calculate the @xmath232 also in su(3 ) with @xmath228 : @xmath233 .",
    "learning from the case of strange electric properties we know that in the @xmath233 we have a good description of the kaonic cloud , however the pionic cloud effect is wrongly calculated . to remove this wrong pionic cloud effect ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath232 in su(2 ) with @xmath228 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath234 , and subtract it from the @xmath233 .",
    "this subtraction gives only kaonic cloud effect with a correct yukawa tail behavior .",
    "finally we can obtain the neutron electric form factor with the effects of the proper pionic and kaonic clouds : @xmath235 we call this the _",
    "hybrid method_. we show the neutron electric charge distribution calculated with the hybrid method in fig.[fig - hbd ] .",
    "the kaonic cloud is fitted by the yukawa form with @xmath226  mev@xmath227 .",
    "we show the neutron electric form factors calculated with the hybrid method in fig.[fig - hyf ] . obviously",
    "the result of the hybrid method is very different from those of the pure hedgehog methods .",
    "the results of the hybrid method agree much better with the experimental data .",
    "we also give the results of the electric charge radius in table  [ tab - ner ] .",
    "apparently the valence quark contribution to the electric charge radius with the hybrid method is almost the same as the su(3 ) result with @xmath218 .",
    "this suggests that the contributions from hyperon components are rather insensitive to the mesonic cloud effects .",
    "the resulting kaonic cloud effect in the hybrid calculation gives quite a small contribution in comparison to the su(3 ) result with @xmath218 . with the proper kaonic cloud effect of the hybrid method",
    "we also obtain an improved neutron electric charge radius . in fig.[fig - npk ] we show the neutron electric charge density in the case of @xmath74  mev .",
    "we investigate also the proton electric properties using the hybrid method .",
    "we show the electric form factor and charge radius of proton in fig.[fig - hyp ] and table  [ tab - per ] , respectively .",
    "the proton is a rather insensitive system to the mesonic clouds in comparison with the neutron and hence previous calculations with @xmath218 in su(2 ) and su(3 ) are not much affected  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the effects of the kaonic cloud on the electric properties of the nucleon within the chiral quark soliton model in su(3 ) flavor space . to this end",
    "we have formulated a meson expansion which allows to identify the mesonic clouds in a solitonic field .",
    "we have shown that the sea quark polarization part of the calculation corresponds to the contribution from the mesonic excitation of the vacuum .",
    "the usual evaluation of the neutron electric form factor with the hedgehog pion , which has the yukawa tail behavior characterized by the pion mass , gives a serious underestimation .",
    "the reason is that the kaon field has the same tail behavior as the pion filed because it arises as the rotational excitation of the hedgehog pion field .",
    "we have solved this problem using the hybrid method of treating the mesonic clouds . in this approach one",
    "treats the form factor in an operational way that the proper asymptotic behavior of both pionic and kaonic clouds are respected .",
    "the neutron electric form factor turns out to be very sensitive to the treatment of the mesonic clouds .",
    "the result of the hybrid method differs noticeably from previous su(2 ) and su(3 ) calculations of the chiral quark soliton model and agrees well with the experiments .",
    "we have shown also the strange electric form factor and the square radius using the hybrid method and obtained remarkably smaller results than those appearing in the previous works done in the same model framework .",
