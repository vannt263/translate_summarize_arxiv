    "the study of x - ray binary populations in galaxies outside of our own galaxy is of major interest .",
    "first the evolution of our galaxy is specific which reflects itself in their different stellar populations , their ages and distributions .",
    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , satellites of our own galaxy , show different chemical compositions are irregular in shape and are heavily interacting with our galaxy ( gardiner et al .",
    "this influences the star formation history .",
    "any kind of study of stellar populations is therefore of particular interest .",
    "x - ray binaries are interacting binaries with mass transfer from a donor star to a compact object , a white dwarf , neutron star or a black hole .",
    "they are evolved objects with the compact object being the product of evolution of a more massive star ( cf .",
    "van den heuvel 1994 , livio 1994 ) .",
    "the neutron star ( ns ) binaries are classified into high- and low - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs and lmxbs ) . the hmxbs have donor stars more massive than @xmath08 - 10  @xmath3 and belong to the youngest stellar population of the galaxy ( age @xmath4 ) .",
    "the lmxbs belong to a much older stellar population ( age @xmath5 ) .",
    "they are concentrated in the galactic bulge and in the globular clusters ( van den heuvel 1992 ) .",
    "the magellanic system ( ms ) can be described as a binary system consisting of the lmc and the smc which are orbiting around the galaxy ( cf .",
    "gardiner et al . 1994 ) . in this description",
    "the ms forms a great circle in the sky perpendicular to the galactic poles .",
    "the mcs are presently near the perigalacticon and were never closer to the galaxy . due to the frictional force in the galactic halo the orbital period of the mcs about the galaxy",
    "is decaying ( last orbital period @xmath01.3  gyr , initial orbital period @xmath03  gyr ) .",
    "the present centre - to - centre distance between the mcs is @xmath021  kpc .",
    "a close encounter between the mcs occurred @xmath00.2 - 0.4  gyr ago at a distance of 7  kpc .",
    "the previous encounter was at a much larger distance of 13  kpc .",
    "this may have stimulated star formation in the mcs ( @xmath00.2  gyr ago ) and may explain why the star formation histories in the mcs are so different from those in the galaxy",
    ". there is evidence of recent externally stimulated star formation in the _ wing _ of the smc .",
    "the age of the stellar associations in the smc _ wing _ and in the inter - cloud region is less than 0.05  gyr .",
    "this would require a delay of at least 80  million years between the last lmc - smc encounter and the onset of star formation activity .",
    "the spatial structure of the smc has e.g. been deduced from observations of cepheids . according to this view",
    "the smc is composed of a 5-to-1 bar ( seen edge - on ) , a near arm in the north - east , and a far arm in the south - west .",
    "there is in addition material pulled out of the centre of the smc ( by the lmc ) which is seen in projection in front of the arm in the south - west ( cf . caldwell & coulson 1986 ) .",
    "a point to note is that the smc spiral arms are very young .",
    "it is not expected that the old population of lmxbs have yet formed there . actually before no single candidate lmxb has been known in the smc . in the smc bulge lmxbs",
    "may well have formed due to its considerable age of @xmath015  gyr .",
    "but possible kicks and small number statistics make it difficult to test these scenarii .    before the observations of the smc with six hard x - ray binary sources have been reported in the smc ( clark et al .",

    "we investigate source variability and transient behavior , the luminosity distribution , extrapolate from the discussed smc populations to the galactic populations and discuss the nature of the rejected candidate x - ray binaries .",
    "finally we summarize in section  5 our results .",
    "the observations reported in this paper were carried out with the _ pspc _ detector onboard the observatory during the all - sky survey ( rass ) and during 9 pointed observations in the time from 8  october 1991 to 14  october  1993 .",

    "most sources have been covered by more than one pointing and a search for long - term ( @xmath0half a year ) variability became possible .",
