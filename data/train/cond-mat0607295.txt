    "vertical alignment is attractive for such applications as field emission displays  @xcite and chemical sensors@xcite .",
    "latest publications  @xcite report almost perfect alignment .",

    "the objective of this effort is the synthesis of complex organized nt structures for integrated molecular electronics devices and optoelectronic applications .",
    "growth and patterning of in - plane oriented arrays require novel technological approaches .",
    "a number of such approaches have been proposed in refs . , and successfully implemented .",
    "a planar array of nts is shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "in a typical experimental situation the distance , @xmath4 , between the neighboring nts in the array is much smaller than the length , @xmath0 , of the constituting nts .",
    "this suggests that the response of the array to the external electric field must exhibit a _ collective _ character . for vertically oriented arrays",
    ", the collective electrostatic response has been previously discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "this response plays a crucial role in designing the nt - based field emitters . for planar arrays , being the emerging area of research , their collective electrostatic properties have never been addressed .",
    "intuitively , it is obvious that responses of vertical and planar arrays to external electric field are dramatically different . indeed",
    ", external field does not penetrate into a dense enough vertical array much deeper than the intertube distance@xcite .",
    "in other words , to the first approximation , the tops of nts constituting the vertical array can be considered as a metallic plate . by contrast , for a planar array , the force lines of external field can extend `` above '' and `` below '' the nt plane ( see fig .",
    "1b ) , thus causing the charge separation within each nt , constituting the array .",
    "the collective character of the electrostatic response manifests itself in the fact that the _ actual field _ , causing this separation in a given nt is strongly altered by the presence of the neighboring nts .",
    "the resulting dipole moment , induced in an individual nt within the planar array , depends on the charge distribution , the form of which is not obvious _ a priori_.",

    "it is not obvious how , upon increasing @xmath1 above @xmath8 , the field - induced charge separation occurs in a planar array of semiconducting nts . in particular , how the length of the neutral strip depends on the parameters of the array , namely , the length and density of constituting nts .",

    "derivation of the thomas - fermi for the planar array is completely analogous to that for vertical array  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) and goes as follows .",

    "these results were obtained in the continuous limit , i.e. , we replaced the array of individual nts with a two - dimensional continuous layer of a zero width .",
    "such a replacement is justified with high accuracy as long as the nt length , @xmath174 , exceeds the separation , @xmath4 , between the neighboring nts .",
    "more quantitatively , as shown in appendix , the relative correction to the induced charge distribution is @xmath177 .",
    "similarly , the randomness in distances between the neighboring nts is not important for the planar array .",
    "this should be contrasted to the _ infinite _ vertical array@xcite , where the distance between _ neighboring _ nts governs the penetration depth of the external field . by contrast , the continuous description adopted in the present paper applies with high accuracy , since , in the planar array , the induced charge extends over the entire length , @xmath0 , of the nts .",
    "this length the is much bigger than @xmath178 .",
    "the discreteness of the array manifests itself only in the close vicinity of the tips , where it cuts off the singularity @xmath179 in the distribution of the induced charge .",
    "it is instructive to trace how the results obtained in the present paper for the planar array evolve when one considers the vertical array of a _",
    "finite _ thickness , @xmath180 .",
    "consider first the most interesting case of intermediate thickness , @xmath181 .",
    "the modification of our result eq .",
    "( [ metalsol ] ) to this case can be understood from the following reasoning .",
    "each square with the side @xmath180 contains @xmath182 nts .",
    "this square can be viewed as a single `` combined '' nt . then the charge density in this combined nt",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( [ metalsol ] ) with @xmath27 replaced by @xmath183 . to find the charge density",
    "_ per a single _ nt , this result should be divided by @xmath182 .",
    "thus we conclude , that modification of eq .",
    "( [ metalsol ] ) to finite @xmath184 amounts to the replacement of @xmath178 by @xmath185 , so that the induced charge density falls off as @xmath186 with increasing the width . however , the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ metalsol ] ) to the finite - width array is limited by the size of a `` combined '' nt , i.e. , @xmath187 must exceed @xmath180 . as @xmath180 exceeds the nt length",
    ", this condition can not be met , and the charge distribution changes dramatically from the power - law behavior to the exponential screening@xcite .",
    "note that our basic integral equation , eq .",
    "( [ inteq1 ] ) , expressing the fact that electrochemical potential is constant along each nt of the array allow the exact solution using the technique of conformal mapping only when the `` self - action '' [ second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ inteq1 ] ) ] is neglected .",
    "this step is well justified for a dense array . in the electrostatics of inhomogeneous fractional quantum hall liquids @xcite the charge distribution",
    "is described by the equations similar to eq .",
    "( [ inteq1 ] ) , i.e. , with logarithmic kernel , but with self - action playing an important role .",
    "then these equations can be solved only numerically .",
    "this work was supported by nsf under grant no .",
    "dmr-0503172 and by the petroleum research fund under grant no .",
    "below we present a rigorous derivation of eq .",
    "( [ inteq1 ] ) for a periodic array of nts .",
    "we start from the identity @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . to use this identity in eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) , we set @xmath190",
    ". then the summation in the integrand in the rhs can be readily performed ; it transforms the sum over @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) into the following sum of the @xmath191-functions @xmath192 where @xmath193 assumes _ all _ integer values . as the next step",
    "we isolate the term with @xmath194 in the kernel eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) from all other terms with nonzero @xmath193 .",
    "then we make use of the fact , that @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the euler constant .",
    "then , for the term with @xmath194 , we get @xmath197={2\\over d}\\ln \\biggl|{\\frac { z - z^{\\prime } } { z+z^{\\prime}}}\\biggr|.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , after performing the summation over @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ zero_p ] ) , the rhs of eq .  ( [ discrete ] ) will acquire the form @xmath198 where the kernel @xmath199 is given by @xmath200.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] first term in ( [ 5 ] ) describes the continuous limit ; it reproduces the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ inteq1 ] ) and comes from @xmath194 in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the remaining sum over @xmath193 gives rise to the `` self - action '' term in eq .",
    "( [ inteq1 ] ) . the easiest way to see",
    "this is to replace the summation over @xmath193 by integration @xmath201 , which would immediately yield @xmath202 for the second part of the kernel ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath203 is nothing but the kernel for a _ single _ nt  @xcite .",
    "however , the replacement of the @xmath204 by @xmath205 is justified only when a large number of terms contribute to the sum .",
    "this is the case only when the condition @xmath206 is met .",
    "then , upon substituting ( [ single ] ) into ( [ 3 ] ) and restricting integration over @xmath51 to @xmath207 , the self - action term in eq .",
    "( [ inteq1 ] ) is recovered .",
    "concerning the second part of the kernel  ( [ 5 ] ) at @xmath208 , it is dominated by the terms with @xmath209 , which behave as @xmath210 .",
    "contribution coming from this part to the integral eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) is @xmath211 , which is parametrically smaller than the self - action term @xmath212 .",
