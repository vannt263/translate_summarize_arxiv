    "additionally , in order for very metal - poor galaxies to exist in the local universe , processes of either enriched gas outflow or pristine gas inflow are usually invoked , thus these galaxies can provide important constraints to understanding the role of gas inflows and/or outflows on galaxian evolution .",

    "some authors have extended the search out to intermediate redshift @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have used emission - line surveys , seeking metal - poor galaxies from large samples of strong emission - line sources .",
    "while these searches have led to a significant increase in the number of known metal - poor galaxies , there have been relatively few discovered in the range qualifying as xmd .",
    "the seeming dearth of xmd galaxies has raised the question of whether they are intrinsically rare objects in the local universe or if they exist in large numbers but are mostly missed because emission - line surveys are biased toward systems with bright , high surface brightness  regions ( i.e. , systems that have recently undergone a very strong starburst ) and are relatively insensitive to isolated low - mass , relatively quiescent star - forming galaxies .    a promising alternative method for finding xmd galaxies has been to study very low - luminosity dwarfs since there is an historically well - established correlation between metallicity and luminosity among low - redshift dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this method has already led to the discovery of several xmd galaxies @xcite . despite the fact that there should be large numbers of low - luminosity galaxies according to the galaxy luminosity function , searching for these systems",
    "is very difficult as they tend to be very low surface brightness and difficult to detect optically .",
    "however , blind  surveys do not suffer optical selection biases and thus can uncover low - mass  sources that potentially have low - surface brightness optical counterparts that may be missed in optical studies .",
    "it is particularly important to identify and study _ low surface brightness _",
    "xmd sources because our current understanding of xmd galaxies is derived almost exclusively from blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) .",
    "however , normal low - luminosity star - forming galaxies should outnumber bcds by at least an order of magnitude and thus should be more representative of the xmd population .",
    "the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs ; * ? ? ? * ) detected many low - mass sources with low - surface brightness dwarf irregular optical counterparts .",
    "twelve of these adbs galaxies were selected for spectroscopic follow - up by @xcite to determine their chemical abundances . while none of these galaxies were found to be xmd galaxies , the sample was generally low - metallicity and showed that -surveys can efficiently uncover metal - poor and potential xmd galaxies .",

    "twelve of these galaxies , with 10@xmath11 , were selected for the shield project @xcite from a preliminary alfalfa catalog .",
    "the galaxies selected for shield were those with the lowest  mass that had apparent optical counterparts in sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ) images .",
    "these galaxies represent the lowest mass potentially star - forming galaxies that have formed a significant number of stars .",
    "thus , following the traditional luminosity - metallicity trend ( or mass - metallicity trend ) , the galaxies in this sample should be some of the most metal - poor star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the shield project encompasses a complex multi - wavelength data set including detailed  gas mapping from multi - configuration expanded very large arrayobservations @xcite , broadband bvr and narrowband h@xmath4 imaging from the wiyn 3.5 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory(kpno ; n.  haurberg et al .  in preparation ) , 3.6 and 4.5@xmath12 imaging with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the spitzer space telescope , hubble space telescopeimaging with the wide field camera 3 using the f606w ( @xmath13 ) and f814w ( @xmath14 ) filters , and long - slit optical spectra with the richey - chretien focus spectrograph on the mayall 4 m at kpno ( this work ) .",
    "since these galaxies were selected from a blind  survey , the sample does not suffer any bias toward high - surface brightness objects as is often present in optical catalogs .",

    "the h@xmath4  imaging revealed that the star formation in these galaxies was generally confined to 1 or 2 knots of star formation which were targeted with long - slit spectroscopic follow - up observations presented in this work .",
    "two of the shield galaxies , agc 749241 and agc 748778 were not included in this spectroscopic follow - up as the h@xmath4  imaging revealed no star - forming nebulae .",

    "the nominal field of view was 9.6@xmath22 9.6@xmath23 across 2 chips and 4 amplifiers .",
    "exposure times for the broadband images in the fall were 900 , 720 , and 600 s for @xmath6 , @xmath21 , and @xmath15 bands , respectively .",
    "the narrowband imaging was taken in sets of two long narrowband h@xmath4  exposures ( 900 s ) with a short ( 180 s ) r - broadband image between them .",
    "since the conditions were less ideal in the spring , longer exposure times were used .",

    "the broadband observations times should be sufficiently long to have detected any diffuse emission from the galaxies .",
    "these optical broadband images were analyzed with both isophotal fitting techniques as well as large aperture photometry as discussed in detail in n.  haurberg et al .  in preparation . while we can not rule out that there may be an extraordinarily low surface brightness component that was not detected in our images , comparison of with the subsequent hst imaging ( ? ? ? ? ? ) shows now indication of such , thus we remain confident our images were sufficient at detecting all of the optical emission in these galaxies .      the spectral observations presented in this work were carried out using the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory with the richey - chretien focus spectrograph and t2ka imager over the course of 5 nights : 2012 april 1719 and 2012 october 1516 .",

    "all spectra were taken with a slit - width of 1.5  and the slit extended 324  along the spatial direction .",
    "target sources were too dim to be seen with the acquisition cameras , so nearby bright stars were used for blind - offsets .",
    "offsets were checked by using multiple stars in the field , and were successful in aligning sources within the slit .",
    "the slit was positioned as nearly along the parallactic angle as possible to avoid the effects of differential refraction through the atmosphere .",
    "since the star - forming regions in these galaxies are relatively isolated , usually only the target source fell in the slit , but in two cases an additional emission nebula ended up in the slit as well .",
    "we observed several spectrophotometric standard stars throughout each night , which were used to calibrate the flux scale for our spectra .",
    "the standards were selected from the lists of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each night we additionally took images of henear spectral lamps for wavelength calibration , zero - length exposure bias images , internal quartz lamps for flat field calibration , and twilight sky images to correct for slit - width variations .",
    "spectral images were processed through the standard spectral reduction routines in iraf .",
    "the bias level was determined from the overscan region in each image and the mean bias image was used to account for any two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure in the bias .",
    "median combined quartz lamp flats were used to account for pixel - to - pixel variations and twilight sky flats were used to create an illumination function correcting for variations in the slit width .",
    "the science images were then processed through the lacos_spec cosmic ray rejection routine of @xcite and the resultant  cleaned \" images were examined carefully by eye in comparison with the original image to ensure that emission line pixels were not rejected as cosmic rays .",
    "region spectra were extracted using the apall package in iraf . since the diffuse background emission was typically very weak , local sky regions that closely bracketed the emission line source were selected for night - sky subtraction .",
    "the wavelength scale was determined for each night using the solution derived from henear lamp spectra .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard stars were then used to create a sensitivity function that was applied to all the spectra .",

    "are included in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "we have plotted a version showing the full dynamic range of the emission and another version that displays only a small range in flux .",
    "once emission lines were identified they were measured using the splot routine in iraf .",
    "this routine allows interactive setting of the continuum level at each line . to decide on the correct location for the continuum we used an average of the local continuum on either side of the emission line and assumed a linear fit for for the continuum under the emission line .",
    "we generally assumed that the continuum remained at a constant level under the emission line except for those cases where the lines were very broad or the slope of the continuum was steep enough to change significantly through the line .",
    "since we are measuring emission from regions of relatively recent star - formation it is expected that the permitted balmer lines are affected by underlying absorption from hot main - sequence stars .",
    "the underlying absorption was accounted for by first assuming that the equivalent width of absorption is the same for all the balmer lines and then using multiple balmer emission - line ratios ( h@xmath4/h@xmath25 , h@xmath26/h@xmath25 , and h@xmath27/h@xmath25 ) to simultaneously estimate the amount of underlying absorption and c(h@xmath25 ) ( i.e. the absorption coefficient at h@xmath25 ) .",
    "we were able to estimate the proper absorption correction by determining where the c(h@xmath25 ) coefficients calculated from each balmer ratio converged .",
    "this correction was applied to the hydrogen lines so that the relative balmer intensities could be used to accurately determine the reddening for each  region . in cases where only one balmer ratio was available ,",
    "an average absorption correction of 1.0   was used since most  regions showed some absorption that we felt needed to be accounted for .",
    "the reddening was determined using the reddening law of @xcite and using the temperature derived from the [ ] lines when possible .",
    "if the [ ] @xmath5  line was not detected , we assumed an electron temperature of 10,000 k.    since the balmer decrement was used to calculate the reddening , there is no distinction between intrinsic and foreground reddening .",
    "the reddening corrected flux measurements ( relative to h@xmath25 ) for each line we measured are tabulated for each  region in table [ tab : c4gold ] , along with the assumed equivalent width of underlying absorption ( w@xmath28 ) , c(h@xmath25 ) , and the assumed t@xmath29  and n@xmath29 .",
    "the electron temperature ( @xmath30 ) and electron density ( n@xmath29 ) of the nebula were estimated using the [ ] @xmath5@xmath31[]@xmath32  and [ ] @xmath33 ratios , respectively . for cases where the [ ] @xmath5  line was measured ,",
    "the temperature and density calculation were performed with the elsa program @xcite described more completely in the following section . in cases where there was not a reliable measurement of [ ] @xmath33 a default electron density of 100",
    "@xmath34 was assumed .",
    "this density is consistent with what is commonly observed for  regions .",
    "the errors given on the line fluxes were calculated by fully propagating the derived errors from the relevant quantities ( e.g. , rms of the continuum , rms scatter in flux calibration , etc . ) .",

    "the solid line traces the star - forming galaxy models of @xcite ; the dashed line @xcite delineates the region of the diagram usually occupied by agn.,width=576 ]    it is clear that  regions from the shield galaxies lie below and to the left of the majority of the kiss sample and the theoretical high - excitation star - forming model curve .",
    "this is consistent with the manner in which these galaxies were selected and indicates that the observed  regions in the shield galaxies are generally low - excitation systems .",
    "emission - line surveys like kiss are much less likely to include these types of low - excitation systems because the key emission lines used for selection in those surveys need to be strong , high equivalent - width lines in order to be detected .",
    "the relatively low - excitation of these systems indicates that either the initial mass function ( imf ) was not fully populated or the most massive stars formed in these regions have already evolved off the main sequence .",
    "both possibilities are consistent with the expectation for very low - luminosity galaxies as either would lead to reduced luminosity and surface brightness in comparison to the more well - studied low - metallicity bcds .",
    "three of the  regions that we observed ( agc 110482__b _ _ , agc 112521 , agc 111977 ) had such weak [ ] @xmath37  lines that we were unable to determine an accurate measurement of [ ] @xmath35 .",
    "thus , these three  regions have been plotted with arrows indicating the measured [ ] @xmath35  is an upper limit .",
    "the lack of distinguishable [ ] @xmath37  emission is consistent with these being among the lowest metallicity regions ( see table [ tab : abun ] ) .",
    "the  regions from the shield galaxies all occupy the region of the diagram expected for low - metallicity star - forming systems . however , the  regions spread over a significant portion of the low - metallicity region while the derived abundances in table [ tab : abun ] cover a quite narrow range .",
    "this is consistent with the finding of @xcite that there is significant scatter in the position of similar metallicity  regions on the diagnostic diagram .    in order to accurately determine the chemical abundances for emission line nebulae , it is preferable to have a direct measurement of the electron temperature t@xmath29 . in the wavelength range covered by our observations ,",
    "the best way to calculate t@xmath29  is from measuring the [ ] @xmath5  line .",
    "the [ ] @xmath5  and [ ] @xmath32  lines are produced by electronic transitions from different energy levels in the o@xmath38 ion .",
    "the relative strengths of the lines thus depend on the population of the different energy levels , which is strongly dependent on the temperature of the electrons ( and to a lesser extent , the electron density ) .",
    "[ ] @xmath5  is usually a very weak line that is often difficult to detect .",
    "we were able to detect this line in two of our  regions , although the detection in agc 182595 is noisy and thus fairly uncertain .",
    "in order to calculate the nebular abundances for these  regions we used the elsa ( emission line spectrum analyzer ) program which is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "elsa uses a five - level atom routine with ionization correction factors and a two - region ionization model to calculate abundances .",
    "the five - level atom calculations are based on the work of @xcite but include multiple updates and improvements ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the [ ] @xmath5/[]@xmath32   ratios is used to calculate temperature in the high - ionization region and the [ ] @xmath33 ratio used to calculate the electron density ( in the low - ionization region ) using an iterative process similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the low - ionization region temperature would ideally be calculated from the ratio [ ] @xmath395755/[]@xmath406548,6583 , however , [ ] @xmath395755 is a weak line that is usually not detectable in star - forming regions .",
    "therefore , the temperature of the low - ionization region is estimated using @xmath41 and following the method of @xcite .",
    "the ionization correction factors are determined from lines with similar ionization potentials and then used to account for the unseen ionization states .",
    "many uncertainties , including those in line fluxes , reddening correction , plasma diagnostics , and ionic abundances are carried through the elsa program and propagated properly into the final uncertainties in the abundances .    in cases where t@xmath29  is not directly measurable , strong - line calibrations must be used .",
    "these methods rely on ratios of strong emission lines to estimate an electron temperature and thus metallicity .",
    "specifically , most strong - line abundance methods are calibrated to a specific oxygen abundance ; we will use oxygen abundance to be synonymous with metallicity for the remainder of this paper .",
    "while these methods are very useful , some caution must be employed as they are reliant on both theoretical models and empirical calibration to arrive at an abundance .",
    "one of the most robust strong - line methods for determining oxygen abundance is that of mcgaugh ( 1991 ; henceforth the mcgaugh method ) .",
    "the mcgaugh method uses several key abundance ratios :    r@xmath42 : :    :    log(([]@xmath43+[]]@xmath44)/h@xmath25 ) o@xmath42 : :    :    log([]@xmath43/[]@xmath44 ) [ / [ : :    : log([@xmath45\\,\\lambda6583$]/[]@xmath44 ) .",
    "each measured  region is placed on a grid of model emission nebula using the r@xmath42 and o@xmath42 parameters as shown in figure [ fig : c4mcg ] .",
    "since the models are degenerate ( i.e. there are two possible oxygen abundances that can produce the same values for r@xmath42 and o@xmath42 ) the value of [ / [ is used to break the degeneracy between high- and low- metallicity  branches . \"",
    "regions are placed on the low - metallicity branch if [ ] /[]@xmath46 and the high - metallicity branch if [ ] / [ ] @xmath47 .",

    "the points plotted within circles represent those  regions where the [ ] @xmath5  line was detected.,width=576 ]    the degeneracy of the mcgaugh models can be troublesome and lead to significant uncertainty when the branch is not well determined .",
    "however , the method is ideal for use with a sample like ours where the branch is unambiguous .",
    "the mcgaugh method is a particularly robust strong - line calibration because it uses the total flux in the strong oxygen lines ( the r@xmath42 parameter ) to determine oxygen abundance , and also accounts for different hardness of the ionizing spectra by incorporating the o@xmath42 parameter which greatly improves its accuracy .",
    "the precise value of the oxygen abundance derived from the mcgaugh method depends not only on the values of r@xmath42 and o@xmath42 but also on the specifics of which models were used to create the grids .",
    "we have used the models described in @xcite where the highest mass star produced from the imf is 60 @xmath3 .",
    "the exact value of the oxygen abundance was determined by using the position of each  region and interpolating between the model points to estimate abundance more precisely .",
    "a final table of abundances as well as key line ratios is presented in table [ tab : abun ] .",
    "column 1 lists the galaxy and specific -region where applicable .",
    "columns 2@xmath504 contain the line ratios used to calculate the abundance via the mcgaugh method .",
    "column 5 gives the oxygen abundance determined via the mcgaugh method ( in terms of log(o / h)+12 ) while column 6 gives the oxygen abundance determined via the t@xmath29  method when available .",
    "column 7 lists the error - weighted mean oxygen abundance from the individual  regions in agc 110482 and agc 749237 .",
    "the abundance listed in bold is the assumed abundance for each galaxy .",
    "we do not give explicit errors on the mcgaugh abundances , but will assume an error of 0.10 dex .",
    "the abundances derived via the mcgaugh and t@xmath29  methods are not in perfect agreement with each other which is consistent with what has been reported by other authors .",
    "the inconsistency is often considered an effect of intrinsic errors in the strong - line calibration methods since they rely on indirect determinations of t@xmath29 . while the t@xmath29  method provides a direct measurement of the electron temperature it is also subject to some level of uncertainty and bias as it has been shown to favor higher temperature regions in the case that there are temperature fluctuations in the nebula being observed @xcite .",
    "thus , it can be difficult to determine",
    "which method more accurately yields the  correct \" abundance .    some authors ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the adbs sample is of particular interest as it was chosen in a similar manner to the shield sample ( e.g. , adbs is a blind  survey ) and thus has similar selection biases .",

    "the reduced @xmath59 values listed in that table are calculated for each fit and compared to the sample plotted in the indicated figure ; @xmath60 was calculated assuming abundance to be the dependent variable .",
    "we chose not to include a fit to the shield sample alone because it is a statistically small sample that covers a limited luminosity range , thus it produced significant uncertainties in the quality of the fit .",
    "the various fits are in general agreement within the errors ( with the exception of the  -sample \" fit which is discussed in the following paragraph ) . in all cases , the inclusion of the shield sample results in a more shallow slope , as could easily be predicted from inspection of figure [ fig : lz ] .",
    "the shield galaxies clearly lie above literature galaxies of similar luminosity even when the corrected abundances are used .",
    "this is certainly an intriguing trend , but since we have a relatively small sample it is possible that this is due to intrinsic scatter in the relationship owing to differing mass - to - light ratios in the @xmath6-band or uncertainty in measurement of both luminosity and abundance .",
    "however , it may represent something more significant such as a fundamental difference in the samples or a flattening of the l - z relationship at low - luminosity .",
    "the fit obtained from the -selected samples ( dotted line ) is interesting as it is significantly different from the other fits .",
    "it has a slope that is substantially shallower than the average slope of the other fits , but provides the best fit to the shield sample according the reduced @xmath59 test .",
    "this indicates that the sample selection process may be a contributing factor and may suggest underlying physical differences between samples selected from  surveys and those selected from optical catalogs or emission line - surveys . for consistency",
    ", we used the uncorrected abundances for figure [ fig : lz]*b * and when fitting this  selected sample since the adbs galaxies have a mix of strong - line and t@xmath29  derived abundances . when the corrected abundances are used ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lz]*c * ) the obvious discrepancy between the shield sample and the fit from the comparison sample is reduced . however , even when the corrected abundances are used , all but one of the shield galaxies lie above the fit line indicating some level of systematic difference that is unlikely to be due solely to intrinsic scatter in the relationship . these issues are further discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "figure [ fig : mz]*a * shows another version of the l - z diagram .",
    "this version uses the corrected abundances for the shield galaxies , like figure [ fig : lz]*c * , but uses the nir luminosity ( 4.5@xmath12 band ; @xmath61 ) instead of the @xmath6-band luminosity as the luminosity metric .",
    "since we do not have reliable 4.5@xmath12 luminosities for one of the shield galaxies for which we measured an abundance ( agc 731457 ) , this version of the l - z relationship only features 7 of the galaxies in the shield sample .",
    "the shield galaxies are more coincident with the comparison data in the nir version of the l - z diagram than they are in figure [ fig : lz ] .",
    "the fits derived from fitting the comparison sample ( solid line ) are nearly identical to those calculated when the shield data are added to the set ( dashed line ) . despite the similarity of the fits , the majority of the shield galaxies still appear above the fit line on this diagram , again suggesting the possible presence of a systematic difference from the comparison sample .",
    "the fit parameters for figure [ fig : mz ] are given in table [ tab : fits ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mz]*b * the mass metallicity ( m - z ) relationship is shown . for the comparison sample , stellar mass was derived using the 4.5@xmath12 flux and the @xmath62 ( @xmath63-band magnitude ) color following @xcite .",
    "the shield ir observations do not include the k - band , so stellar masses for the shield sample had to be derived in a different manner .",
    "we used the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath12 magnitudes and followed the method of @xcite .",
    "since there can be significant uncertainties associated with stellar mass calculations , we performed an independent derivation to check against the mass obtained with the method of @xcite . as a check we used a straight - forward conversion of 3.6@xmath12 luminosity into mass assuming a mass - to - light ratio of 0.5 @xcite and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the mass derived using @xcite and that derived from our  straight - forward \" conversion of 3.6  luminosity was very small ; the average difference was only 0.008 dex . while we can not confirm that our mass estimates are fully consistent with the @xcite method used by @xcite , we do feel confident that the stellar - mass estimates from @xcite for the shield galaxies given in this paper are consistent with other ir - based mass derivation methods . due to the use of different stellar - mass calculation methods and the inherently difficult nature of determining stellar masses ,",
    "we proceed with some caution concerning the results derived using these mass estimates .",
    "similar to the nir - lz relationship , the shield galaxies appear consistent with the literature samples in the m - z relationship shown in figure [ fig : mz]*b * and the inclusion of the shield data has very little effect on the results of the fit .",

    "various physical mechanisms have been suggested to explain the origin of the m - z relationship for dirrs , but the ejection of enriched gas from low - mass galaxies via supernova and stellar winds is one of the most commonly invoked ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the relationship arises as an effect of an enriched - gas - retention sequence where more massive galaxies are better able to retain enriched ejecta thus producing higher gas phase metallicities . while the retention of metal - enriched gas is likely a contributing factor , most observational studies that indicate the presence of significant gas outflows from isolated dwarf galaxies",
    "are based primarily on bcds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may not apply to dirrs with much less active modes of star - formation .",
    "@xcite , among others , have proposed models for the evolution of dwarf galaxies where star - formation occurs in patterns of relatively strong starbursts that are quenched by supernova feedback and then followed by periods of more moderate star formation ( the so called  breathing \" model ) .",
    "this  bursty \" star formation history may supply a mechanism to remove enriched gas while allowing for periods of more quiescent evolution .",
    "however , it is unclear if the majority of dirrs ever undergo the massive starbursts that are necessary to drive such a model as photometric studies of bcds suggest that the structural properties of these systems are fundamentally different than more  normal \" low - surface brightness dirrs @xcite .",
    "thus other evolutionary scenarios may need to also be considered to explain the observed trends at the low - mass ( and low - luminosity ) end of the l - z and m - z relationships .",
    "as an alternative to bursty star - formation histories for isolated dirrs , @xcite suggest that many observational features of isolated dirrs can be explained _ without _ invoking winds or large scale outflows , but instead rely on continuous infall or cooling of primordial gas and continuous star formation throughout the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "this model provides interesting implications in the context of the results presented in this paper .    in the scenario proposed by @xcite",
    "the galaxies are modeled as a single region and the star formation rate is controlled only by the amount of gas available and an assumed star formation efficiency .",
    "this model does not allow for  bursts \" of rapid star formation but instead produces a smooth , continuous ( though not constant ) star - formation history for the galaxy .",
    "their results suggest that with moderate to low star - formation efficiencies this continuous type of evolution can plausibly reproduce the observed dirr trends and the luminosity - metallicity relationship .",
    "the @xcite models imply that the observed dispersion in abundance seen at a given @xmath6-band luminosity is a result of differing star - formation histories , owing to different star - formation efficiencies and/or different gas - collapse timescales .",
    "this is intriguing in the context of the work we have presented here , because it suggests the offset of the shield sample seen in the @xmath6-band l - z relationship may be indicative of different global star - formation history compared to optically selected samples .",
    "since the shield sample has specifically been chosen to represent some of the lowest - luminosity and lowest - surface brightness galaxies , it is not unreasonable to assume that our selection may be biased to select galaxies with different star - formation histories than those selected from optical catalogs .    @xcite produced similar results to @xcite suggesting that galaxian outflow winds are not necessary to reproduce the observed l - z trends and attribute the inefficient star - formation in low - mass systems to inefficient gas cooling ( i.e. longer collapse timescales ) because of the more extended neutral gas distributions often observed in lower mass systems .",
    "since there are only a limited number of low - mass dirr samples where high quality optical and  data currently exist , it is very difficult to analyze whether this scenario is observationally consistent .",
    "however , we suggest this is an idea worthy of further investigation . further studies with the shield project , and similar projects focusing on low - mass alfalfa sources , should lead to a better understanding of the nature of the gas distributions in low - mass systems and the role that gas dynamics play in their chemical evolution .    the shield galaxies all seem to be  offset \" above the fit line from the comparison sample in the @xmath6-band l - z relationship .",
    "when the  corrected \" abundances are used , the offset , with respect to the fit from the comparison sample , is reduced , yet all but one of the shield galaxies still appears above the fit line . this offset becomes even less pronounced when @xmath55 is replaced with @xmath61 and disappears when stellar mass ( @xmath65 ) is used instead .",
    "this indicates that , on average , the mass - to-(@xmath6-band ) light ratio for the shield galaxies differs from the comparison sample .",
    "this is plausibly consistent with our previous suggestion , that our selection criteria may have biased our sample toward galaxies with a certain star - formation history .",
    "however , the general trend simply suggests that the shield galaxies are _ too massive _ for their @xmath6-band luminosity .",
    "this may arise because at least some portion of the shield galaxies do not approach the quasi - continuous star - formation history that has been suggested for more massive dirrs by @xcite .",
    "a stochastic star - formation history that is similar to that suggested in @xcite but not as continuous ( owing to the lower mass of the system ) could cause the @xmath6-band luminosity to be less reflective of the current stellar mass in these galaxies .",
    "the results presented in this paper do not necessarily clarify any of the issues associated with the chemical evolution of dirrs , but they do suggest that varied star - formation histories need to be considered along with the effects of enriched gas outflows in order to adequately explain the observed trends . additionally , our data suggest that while the m - z relationship may be more fundamental , understanding the relationship of the mass - to - light ratio could reveal details of the star - formation and chemical evolution in these systems .",
    "this sample is just a first step in beginning to fill in the very low - luminosity range of dwarf irregulars .",
    "we have used long - slit spectra from the mayall 4 m telescope at kpno to determine the oxygen abundances for 8 of the 12 shield galaxies . for two galaxies we were able to measure the temperature sensitive [ ] @xmath5  line and",
    "thus directly determine the electron temperature for at least one  region .",
    "we calculated abundances for the other 6 galaxies using the strong - line method of @xcite .",
    "we calculated an empirical correction to the mcgaugh abundance scale using the dirr sample from @xcite , along with the two  regions for which we detected [ ] @xmath5 , allowing us to put our mcgaugh abundances on a consistent scale with those that have a directly determined t@xmath29 .",
    "the galaxies in our sample have well - constrained distances ( hst ; mcquinn et al .",
    "2014 ) , optical luminosities ( wiyn 3.5 m bvr ; n.  haurberg et al .  in preparation ) , and nir luminosities ( spitzer 3.6 and 4.5@xmath12 ; cannon , marshall et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "we compared the l - z and m - z relationships derived from our results with a substantial comparison set from the literature that also have well - determined abundances , distances , and optical and nir luminosities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we additionally included dirr galaxies with well - determined abundances that were selected from the adbs blind -survey @xcite in our comparison sample . while more luminous than our data set , the latter sample is particularly interesting because the method of selection was very similar to that used for the shield data set .",
    "when the l - z relationship was examined using the @xmath6-band luminosity the shield galaxies appear offset from the comparison sample , but that offset disappears when derived stellar mass is used instead .",
    "we suggest that this may indicate that a range of star - formation histories and chemical evolution scenarios for dwarf irregulars should be considered .",
    "the possible effects that such scenarios may have on the the luminosity - metallicity and mass - metallicity relationships warrant further examination and exploration . while the m - z relationship may be more well - constrained",
    ", the l - z relationship may prove observationally important for disentangling the origins of that relationship .",
    "a larger and more comprehensive sample is needed and a more exhaustive comparison between an array of models and multiple observational parameters should be done before any model is too heavily favored .",
    "such a comparison is beyond the scope of this work .    in this work",
    ", we identified two new xmd galaxies in the local universe , agc 112521 and agc 111164 , and showed that blind -surveys like alfalfa are effective in providing candidate xmd dirrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as follow - up studies of the low-  mass sources from the alfalfa survey continue , a larger sample of low - luminosity gas - rich dirrs will become available and allow us to start to unravel some of the puzzles concerning the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies . additionally , current work on resolved stellar populations in the shield galaxies and the leo p dwarf promise to further illuminate the star - formation histories in these very low - mass galaxies and lead to a deeper understanding of galaxian chemical evolution .",

    "<S> we have derived oxygen abundances for 8 galaxies from the survey for  in extremely low - mass dwarfs ( shield ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shield survey is an ongoing study of very low - mass galaxies , with @xmath0 between 10@xmath1 and 10@xmath2 @xmath3 , that were detected by the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath4  </S>",
    "<S> images from the wiyn 3.5 m telescope show that these 8 shield galaxies each possess one or two active star - forming regions which were targeted with long - slit spectral observations using the mayall 4 m telescope at kpno . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a direct measurement of the electron temperature by detection of the weak [ ] @xmath5  line in 2 of the  regions . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen abundances for the other  regions were estimated using a strong - line method . </S>",
    "<S> when the shield galaxies are plotted on a @xmath6-band luminosity - metallicity diagram they appear to suggest a slightly shallower slope to the relationship than normally seen . </S>",
    "<S> however , that offset is systematically reduced when the near - infrared luminosity is used instead . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a different mass - to - light ratio for the galaxies in this sample and we suggest this may be indicative of differing star - formation histories in the lowest luminosity and surface brightness dwarf irregulars . </S>"
