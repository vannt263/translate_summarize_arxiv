    "the passage from commutative to noncommutative structures is a staple in frontier physics and mathematics .",
    "the advent of quantum mechanics is of course an important example but it is now becoming increasingly clear that the appearance , 25 years ago @xcite , of deformation quantization , followed by numerous developments and metamorphoses , has been a major factor in the present trend . the epistemological background can be traced back @xcite to the deformation philosophy which mosh flato developed in the early seventies , motivated by deep ( decades old ) physical ideas and ( then recent ) mathematical developments . since that time , inspiring many , he has consistently pursued and promoted physical and mathematical consequences of that idea in several directions , of which deformation quantization is presently the most widely recognized .",
    "sir michael atiyah said recently , after oscar wilde , that mathematics and physics are two communities separated by a common language .",
    "sir michael added that the two communities managed to communicate rather well until the beginning of the twentieth century , then became so separated that , half a century ago , eugene wigner marveled at what he called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in physics . in the past decade however , in spite of the ever increasing  babel tower effect \" in science , some form of communication was developed , with a converse phenomenon : what may seem an unreasonable effectiveness of physics in mathematics , including in such abstract fields as algebraic geometry . now",
    ", if we remember that mathematics arose as an abstraction of our understanding of the physical world , neither effectiveness should be unreasonable .",
    "we shall see here that deformation quantization is a perfect example of both of them .",
    "physical theories have their domain of applicability defined by the relevant distances , velocities , energies , etc .",
    "but the passage from one domain ( of distances , etc . ) to another does not happen in an uncontrolled way .",
    "rather , experimental phenomena appear that cause a paradox and contradict accepted theories .",
    "eventually a new fundamental constant enters and the formalism is modified . then the attached structures ( symmetries , observables , states , etc . ) _ deform _ the initial structure .",
    "namely , we have a new structure which in the limit , when the new parameter goes to zero , coincides with the previous formalism .",
    "the only question is , in which category do we seek for deformations ? usually physics is rather conservative and if we start e.g. with the category of associative or lie algebras , we tend to deform in the same category , but there are important examples of generalizations of this principle ( e.g. quantum groups are deformations of hopf algebras )",
    ".    the discovery of the non - flat nature of earth may be the first example of this phenomenon .",
    "closer to us , the paradox coming from the michelson and morley experiment ( 1887 ) was resolved in 1905 by einstein with the special theory of relativity : there the galilean geometrical symmetry group of newtonian mechanics is deformed to the poincar group , the new fundamental constant being @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the velocity of light in vacuum . at around the same time the riemann surface theory",
    "can be considered as a first mathematical example of deformations , even if deformations became systematically studied in the mathematical literature only at the end of the fifties with the profound works of kodaira and spencer @xcite on deformations of complex analytic structures .",
    "now , when one has an action on a geometrical structure , it is natural to try and  linearize \" it by inducing from it an action on an algebra of functions on that structure .",
    "this is implicitly what gerstenhaber did in 1963 @xcite with his definition and thorough study of deformations of rings and algebras .",
    "it is in the gerstenhaber sense that the galileo group is deformed to the poincar group ; that operation is the inverse of the notion of group contraction introduced ten years before , empirically , by nn and wigner @xcite .",
    "this fact triggered strong interest for deformation theory in france among a number of theoretical physicists , including flato who had just arrived from the racah school and knew well the effectiveness of symmetry in physical problems .    in 1900 , as a last resort to explain the black body radiation , planck proposed the quantum hypothesis : the energy of light is not emitted continuously but in quanta proportional to its frequency .",
    "he wrote @xmath2 for the proportionality constant which bears his name .",
    "this paradoxical situation got a beginning of a theoretical basis when , again in 1905 , einstein came with the theory of the photoelectric effect . around 1920 ,",
    "an `` agrg dhistoire '' , prince louis de broglie , was introduced to the photoelectric effect , together with the planck  einstein relations and the theory of relativity , in the laboratory of his much older brother , maurice duc de broglie .",
    "this led him , in 1923 , to his discovery of the duality of waves and particles , which he described in his celebrated thesis published in 1925 , and to what he called ` mcanique ondulatoire ' .",
    "german and austrian physicists , in particular , hermann weyl , werner heisenberg and erwin schrdinger , transformed it into the quantum mechanics that we know , where the observables are operators in hilbert spaces of wave functions .    intuitively , classical mechanics is the limit of quantum mechanics when @xmath3 goes to zero . but how can this be realized when in classical mechanics the observables are functions over phase space ( a poisson manifold ) and not operators ?",
    "the deformation philosophy promoted by flato showed the way : one has to look for deformations of algebras of functions over poisson manifolds endowed with the poisson bracket and realize , in an _ autonomous _ manner , quantum mechanics there .",
    "this required , as a preliminary , a detailed study of the corresponding cohomology spaces . as a first step , in 1974",
    ", the cochains were assumed @xcite to be 1-differentiable ( given by bidifferential operators of order @xmath4 ) .",
    "this fell short of the solution but inspired vey @xcite who was able in 1975 ( for symplectic manifolds with vanishing third betti number ) to show the existence of such differentiable deformations .",
    "doing so , he rediscovered a formula for the deformed bracket ( the sine of the poisson bracket ) that he did not know had been obtained in an entirely different context by moyal @xcite in 1949 .",
    "the technical obstacle ( a solution of which , in an algebraic context , could later be traced back to a result hidden in a fundamental paper @xcite from 1962 ) was lifted and deformation quantization could be developed @xcite in 197678 . in this approach , as we shall see in the next section , _ quantization is a deformation _ of the associative ( and commutative ) product of classical observables ( functions on phase space ) driven by the poisson bracket , namely a star - product .    in a context which then seemed unrelated to deformation theory ,",
    "pseudodifferential operators were introduced also at the end of the fifties and became a very hot subject in mathematics thanks to the publication in 1963 of the first index theorems by atiyah and singer @xcite , which express an analytically defined index in topological terms .",
    "the composition of symbols of pseudodifferential operators , an important ingredient in the proof , is a nontrivial example of a star - product , but this fact was noticed only years later , after deformation quantization was introduced .",
    "there have been many generalizations of the original index theorems , including algebraic versions developed in particular by connes @xcite in the context of noncommutative geometry , a natural continuation of his important works of the seventies on operator algebras that were motivated by physical problems .",
    "it was developed shortly after the appearance of deformation quantization , using cyclic rather than plain hochschild cohomology . if one adds to star - products the notion of trace ( see section 3.2.2 ) , which in this case comes from integration over the manifold on which the functions are defined , one gets closed star - products @xcite ( classified by cyclic cohomology ) that provide @xcite other examples of algebras falling in the framework of noncommutative geometry .",
    "now the gelfand isomorphism provides a realization of a commutative algebra as an algebra of functions over a manifold , i.e. , its spectrum .",
    "a natural but difficult question is then to develop a theory of noncommutative manifolds .",
    "truly nontrivial examples ( if we exclude the group case , cf . below ) are appearing only recently ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    simple lie groups and algebras are rigid for the gerstenhaber notion of deformation but if one goes to the category of hopf algebras , they can be deformed .",
    "this is what drinfeld @xcite realized with a notion to which he gave the spectacular ( albeit somewhat misleading ) name of quantum group , by considering star - products deforming the product in a hopf algebra of functions on lie groups having a compatible poisson structure .",
    "the dual approach of deforming the coproduct in a closure of enveloping algebras , generalizing the @xmath5 example discovered empirically @xcite in 1981 in relation with quantum inverse scattering problems , was also taken independently by jimbo @xcite .",
    "the domain has since known an extensive development , at the beginning mostly in russia @xcite .",
    "numerous applications to physics were developed in many fields and several metamorphoses occurred both in the mathematical methods used and in the concept itself .",
    "the subject now covers thousands of references , a fraction of which can be found in @xcite , which are recent complementary expositions ( @xcite has 1264 references ! ) we shall not attempt to develop further this important avatar of deformation quantization .",
    "in this part we recall some very classical notions , definitions and properties , for the sake of completeness and the benefit of theoretical physicists who might not be familiar with them but would be willing to take up the mathematical jargon required without having to read an extensive literature .",
    "it may be skipped by many readers . as for all of this paper ,",
    "the interested reader is strongly encouraged to study the references , and the references quoted in references ( etc . ) , at least in the topics that are closest to his interests : the paper is meant to be mostly a starting point for newcomers in the domains covered .    *",

    "the parameter @xmath38 of the deformation is taken to be @xmath164 in physical applications .    _",
    "2.2.2.1 .",
    "a_. using equivalence one may take @xmath165 .",
    "that is the case of moyal , but other orderings like standard or normal do not verify this condition ( only the skew - symmetric part of @xmath61 is @xmath98 ) . again by equivalence , in view of gerstenhaber s result on the unit ( cf . 2.1.2.2 ) , we may take cochains @xmath49 which are without constant term ( what we called n.c . or null on constants ) .",
    "in fact , in the original paper @xcite , only this case was considered and the accent was put on  vey products \" , for which the cochains @xmath49 have the same parity as @xmath56 and have @xmath166 for principal symbol in any darboux chart , with @xmath92 symplectic .    _ b_. it is also possible to consider star - products for which the cochains @xmath162 are allowed to be slightly more general . allowing them to be ( @xmath167 on any open set where @xmath125 or @xmath149 vanish ) gives nothing new .",
    "note that this is not the same as requiring the whole associative product to be local ( in fact the latter condition is very restrictive and , like true pseudodifferential operators , a star - product is a nonlocal operation ) . in some cases",
    "( e.g. for star representations of lie groups ) it may be practical to consider pseudodifferential cochains .",
    "as far as the cohomologies are concerned , as long as one requires at least continuity for the cochains , the theory is the same as in the differentiable case @xcite .    also ,",
    "due to formulas like ( [ epw ] ) and the relation with lie algebras ( see below ) , it is sometimes convenient to take @xmath168 $ ] ( laurent series in @xmath38 , polynomial in @xmath41 and formal series in @xmath38 ) for the ring on which the deformation is defined .",
    "again , this will not change the theory .    _",
    "c_. by taking the corresponding commutator @xmath169_\\lambda=(2\\lambda)^{-1}(u\\star v - v \\star u)$ ] , since the skew - symmetric part of @xmath61 is @xmath98 , we get a deformation of the poisson bracket lie algebra @xmath170 .",
    "this is a crucial point because ( at least in the symplectic case ) we know the needed chevalley cohomologies and ( in contradistinction with the hochschild cohomologies ) they are small @xcite .",
    "the interplay between both structures gives existence and classification ; in addition it will explain why ( in the symplectic case ) the classification of star - products is based on the 1-differentiable cohomologies , hence ultimately on the de rham cohomology of the manifold .",

    "but already on @xmath118 one sees easily that its powers @xmath166 , hence also the moyal bracket ( [ moyal ] ) , are invariant only under flows generated by hamiltonians @xmath125 which are polynomials of maximal order 2 , forming the  affine \" symplectic lie algebra @xmath173 . for other orderings",
    "the invariance is even smaller ( only @xmath174 remains ) . for general vey products the first terms of a star - product are @xcite @xmath175 and @xmath176 . here",
    "@xmath177 is a differential operator of maximal order 2 , @xmath178 a 2-tensor corresponding to a closed 2-form , @xmath22 the chevalley coboundary operator .",
    "@xmath179 is given ( in canonical coordinates ) by an expression similar to @xmath180 in which usual derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives with respect to a given symplectic connection @xmath181 ( a torsionless connection with totally skew - symmetric components when all indices are lowered using @xmath93 ) .",

    "fedosov s algorithmic construction @xcite shows that the symplectic connection @xmath181 plays a role at all orders .",
    "therefore the invariance group of a star - product is a subgroup of the _ finite - dimensional _ group of symplectomorphisms preserving a connection .",

    "invariance of the star - product ensures that the classical and quantum evolutions of observables under a hamiltonian @xmath197 will coincide @xcite .",

    "a similar spectral theory can be done here , in an _ autonomous manner_. the most efficient way to achieve it is to consider @xcite the ( corresponding to the evolution operator ) @xmath201 where @xmath202 means the @xmath203 star power of the hamiltonian @xmath204 ( or @xmath205 $ ] ) .",
    "then one writes its fourier  stieltjes transform @xmath206 ( in the distribution sense ) as @xmath207 and defines _ the spectrum of @xmath208 _ as the _ support @xmath209 of @xmath206 _ ( incidentally this is the definition given by l.  schwartz for the spectrum of a distribution , out of motivations coming from fourier analysis ) . in the particular case when @xmath177 has discrete spectrum , the integral can be written as a sum ( see the top equation in ( [ spec ] ) below for a typical example ) : the distribution @xmath206 is a sum of  delta functions \" supported at the points of @xmath209 multiplied by the symbols of the corresponding eigenprojectors .    in different orderings with various weight functions @xmath130 in ( [ weyl ] ) one gets in general different operators for the same classical observable @xmath177 , thus different spectra .",
    "for @xmath210 all orderings are mathematically equivalent ( to moyal under the fourier transform @xmath211 of the weight function @xmath130 ) .",
    "this means that every observable @xmath177 will have the same spectrum under moyal ordering as @xmath212 under the equivalent ordering .",
    "but this does not imply physical equivalence , i.e. the fact that @xmath177 will have the same spectrum under both orderings .",
    "in fact the opposite is true : if two equivalent star - products are isospectral ( give the same spectrum for a large family of observables and all @xmath213 ) , they are identical @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our definition of spectrum permits to define a spectrum even for symbols of non - spectrable operators , such as the derivative on a half - line which has different deficiency indices ; this corresponds to an infinite potential barrier ( see also @xcite for detailed studies of similar questions ) .",
    "that is one of the many advantages of our autonomous approach to quantization .    _",
    "2.2.3.2 .  applications . _ in quantum mechanics it is preferable to work ( for @xmath210 ) with the star - product that has maximal symmetry , i.e. @xmath214 as algebra of preferred observables : the moyal product .",
    "one indeed finds @xcite that the star exponential of these observables ( polynomials of order @xmath215 ) is proportional to the usual exponential .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath216 with @xmath217 , @xmath218 , setting @xmath219 and @xmath220 one gets , summing the star exponential series and taking its fourier decompositions ( the sums and integrals appearing in the various expressions being convergent as distributions , both in phase - space variables and in @xmath80 or @xmath38 ) @xmath221 @xmath222 we get the discrete spectrum @xmath223 of the _ harmonic oscillator _ and the continuous spectrum @xmath224 for the dilation generator @xmath225 .",

    "other examples can be brought to this case by functional manipulations @xcite .",

    "for the _ hydrogen atom _ , with hamiltonian @xmath231 , the moyal product on @xmath232 ( @xmath233 in the physical case ) induces a star - product on @xmath234 ; the energy levels , solutions of @xmath235 are found from ( [ spec ] ) and the preceding calculations for angular momentum to be ( as they should , with @xmath233 ) @xmath236 for the discrete spectrum , and @xmath237 for the continuous spectrum .",
    "we thus have recovered , in a completely autonomous manner entirely within deformation quantization , the results of  conventional \" quantum mechanics in those typical examples ( many more can be treated similarly ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the term @xmath238 in the harmonic oscillator spectrum , obvious source of divergences in the infinite - dimensional case , disappears if the normal star - product is used instead of moyal  which is one of the reasons it is preferred in field theory .    _ 2.2.3.3 .",
    "remark on convergence and the physical meaning of deformation quantization_. we have always considered star - products as formal series and looked for convergence only in specific examples , generally in the sense of distributions . the same applies to star exponentials , as long as each coefficient in the formal series is well defined . in the case of the harmonic oscillator or more generally the preferred observables @xmath177 in weyl",
    "ordering , the study is facilitated by the fact that the powers @xmath202 are polynomials in @xmath177 .",
    "integral formulas for star - products and star exponentials can be used to give a meaning to these expressions beyond the domains where the sums are convergent or summable . _",
    "the sums must not be considered as perturbation series _ , rather taken as a whole , whether expressed as integral formulas or formal series .",
    "we stress that deformation quantization should not be seen as a mere reformulation of quantum mechanics or quantum theories in general . at the conceptual level",
    ", it is the true mathematical formulation of physical reality whenever quantum effects have to be taken into account .",
    "the above examples show that one can indeed perform important quantum mechanical calculations , in an autonomous manner , entirely within deformation quantization  and get the results obtained in conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "whether one uses an operatorial formulation or some form of deformation quantization formulation is thus basically a practical question , which formulation is the most effective , at least in the cases where a weyl or wigner map exists .",
    "when such a map does not exist , a satisfactory operatorial formulation will be very hard to find , except locally on phase space , and deformation quantization is the solution .",
    "one can of course ( and should in practical examples , as we have done here , and also for algebraic varieties ) look for small domains ( in @xmath100 ) where one has convergence .",
    "we can then speak of  strict \" deformation quantization .",
    "in particular we can look for domains where pointwise convergence can be proved ; this was done e.g. for hermitian symmetric spaces @xcite .",
    "but it should be clearly understood that one can consider wider classes of observables  in fact , the latter tend to be physically more interesting  than those that fit in a strict @xmath239-algebraic approach .    _",

    "quantum groups are an example , when dealing with hopf algebras ; properties of harrison cohomology require going to noncontinuous cochains if one wants nontrivial abelian deformations ( see ( 4.3.3.3 ) and @xcite ) . here is a simpler example .",
    "if one looks for deformations of the poisson bracket lie algebra @xmath170 one finds ( under a mild assumption ) that a further deformation of the moyal bracket , with another deformation parameter @xmath240 , is again a moyal bracket for a @xmath240-deformed poisson structure ; in particular , for @xmath241 , _ quantum mechanics viewed as a deformation is unique and stable_.    now , for the associative algebra @xmath100 , the only _ local _ associative composition laws are of the form @xmath242 for some @xmath243 .",

    "also one faces serious divergence difficulties as soon as one is considering interacting fields theory , and even at the free field level if one wants a mathematically rigorous theory .",
    "but the philosophy in dealing with the divergences is significantly different and one is in position to take advantage of the cohomological features of deformation theory to perform what can be called _ cohomological renormalization _  @xcite .",
    "poisson structures are known on infinite - dimensional manifolds since a long time and there is an extensive literature on this subject .",

    "now if one considers scalar - valued functionals @xmath599 over such a space of solutions , i.e. , over the phase space of initial conditions @xmath600 and @xmath601 , one can consider a poisson bracket defined by @xmath602 where @xmath328 denotes the functional derivative .",
    "the problem is that while it is possible to give a precise mathematical meaning to ( [ poissonf ] ) by specifying an appropriate algebra of functionals , the formal extension to powers of @xmath98 , needed to define the moyal bracket , is highly divergent , already for @xmath180 .",
    "this should not be so surprising for physicists who know from experience that the correct approach to field theory starts with normal ordering , and that there are infinitely many inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations ( as opposed to the von neumann uniqueness in the finite - dimensional case , for projective representations ) , even if in recent physical literature some are working formally with moyal product .",
    "starting with some star - product @xmath45 ( e.g. , an infinite - dimensional version of a moyal - type product or , better , a star - product similar to the normal star - product ( [ np ] ) ) on the manifold of initial data , one would interpret various divergences appearing in the theory in terms of coboundaries ( or cocycles ) for the relevant hochschild cohomology .",
    "suppose that we are suspecting that a term in a cochain of the product @xmath45 is responsible for the appearance of divergences .",
    "applying an iterative procedure of equivalence , we can try to eliminate it , or at least get a lesser divergence , by subtracting at the relevant order a divergent coboundary ; we would then get a better theory with a new star - product , `` equivalent '' to the original one .",
    "furthermore , since in this case we can expect to have at each order an infinity of non equivalent star - products , we can try to subtract a cocycle and then pass to a nonequivalent star - product whose lower order cochains are identical to those of the original one .",
    "we would then make an analysis of the divergences up to order @xmath603 , identify a divergent cocycle , remove it , and continue the procedure ( at the same or hopefully a higher order ) . along the way one should preserve the usual properties of a quantum field theory ( poincar covariance , locality , etc . ) and the construction of adapted star - products should be done accordingly .",

    "the jacobian has to be interpreted as a generalized poisson bracket : it is skew - symmetric with respect to the @xmath722 s , satisfies an identity ( called the fundamental identity ) which is an analogue of the jacobi identity and is a derivation of the algebra of smooth functions on @xmath724 ( i.e. , the leibniz rule is verified in each argument ) .",
    "there is a complete analogy with the poisson bracket formulation of hamilton equations , including the important fact that the components of the @xmath726-tuple of  hamiltonians \" @xmath727 are constants of motion .",
    "shortly afterwards it was shown that nambu mechanics could be seen as a coming from constrained hamiltonian mechanics ; e.g. for @xmath717 one starts with @xmath728 and an identically vanishing hamiltonian , takes a pair of second class constraints to reduce it to some @xmath729 and one more first - class dirac constraint , together with time rescaling , will give the reduction .",
    "chilled \" the domain for almost 20 years  and gives a physical explanation to the fact that nambu could not go beyond heisenberg quantization .    in order to quantize the nambu bracket",
    ", a natural idea is to replace , in the definition of the jacobian , the pointwise product of functions by a deformed product . for this to make sense , the deformed product should be abelian , so we are lead to consider commutative drg - deformations of an associative and commutative product . looking first at polynomials we are lead to the commutative part of hochschild cohomology called harrison cohomology , which is trivial . dealing with polynomials ,",
    "a natural idea is to factorize them and take symmetrized star - products of the irreducible factors .",

    "this fact brought us to generalized deformations , but even that was not enough . dealing with distributivity of the product with respect to addition , and with derivatives , posed difficult problems . in the end we took for observables taylor developments of elements of the algebra of the semi - group generated by irreducible polynomials (  polynomials over polynomials \" , inspired by second quantization techniques ) and were then able to perform a meaningful quantization of these nambu  poisson brackets ( cf .",

    "<S> we start with a short exposition of developments in physics and mathematics that preceded , formed the basis for , or accompanied , the birth of deformation quantization in the seventies . </S>",
    "<S> we indicate how the latter is at least a viable alternative , autonomous and conceptually more satisfactory , to conventional quantum mechanics and mention related questions , including covariance and star representations of lie groups . </S>",
    "<S> we sketch fedosov s geometric presentation , based on ideas coming from index theorems , which provided a beautiful frame for developing existence and classification of star - products on symplectic manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> we present kontsevich s formality , a major metamorphosis of deformation quantization , which implies existence and classification of star - products on general poisson manifolds and has numerous ramifications . </S>",
    "<S> its alternate proof using operads gave a new metamorphosis which in particular showed that the proper context is that of deformations of algebras over operads , while still another is provided by the extension from differential to algebraic geometry . in this panorama </S>",
    "<S> some important aspects are highlighted by a more detailed account .    </S>",
