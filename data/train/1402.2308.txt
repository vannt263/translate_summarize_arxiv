    "the manifestation of crowd actions such as mass demonstrations often involves collective reinforcement of shared ideas . in today s online age , much of this public consciousness and comings together has a significant presence online where issues of concern are discussed and calls to arms are publicized .",
    "the arab spring is oft cited as an example of the new importance of online media in the formation of mass protests @xcite . while the issue of whether mobilization occurs online is highly controversial , that nearly all crowd behavior in the internet - connected world has some presence online is not .",
    "so while it may be infeasible to predict an action developing in secret in a single person s mind , the ready accessibility to public information on the web that future crowds may now be reading and reacting to or members of which are now posting on social media can offer glimpses into the formation of this crowd and the action it may take .",
    "news from mainstream sources from all over the world can now be accessed online and about 500 million tweets are posted on twitter each day with this rate growing steadily @xcite .",
    "blogs and online forums have become a common medium for public discourse and many government publications are offered for free online .",
    "we here investigate the potential of this publicly available information online for predicting mass actions that are so significant that they garner wide mainstream attention from around the world . because these are events perpetrated by human actions , they are in a way endogenous to the system , enabling prediction .",
    "but while all this information is in theory public and accessible and could lead to important insights , gathering it all and making sense of it is a formidable task .",
    "we here use data collected by recorded future ( www.recordedfuture.com ) .",
    "scanning over 300,000 different open content web sources in 7 different languages and from all over the world , mentions of events  in the past , current , or said to occur in future  are continually extracted at a rate of approximately 50 extractions per second .",
    "using natural language processing , the type of event , the entities involved and how , and the timeframe for the event s occurrence are resolved and made available for analysis .",
    "with such a large dataset of what is being said online ready to be processed by a computer program , the possibilities are infinite . for one ,",
    "as shown herein , the gathering of crowds into a single action can often be seen through trends appearing in this data far in advance .",
    "we here study the cases of mass protests and politically motivated cyber campaigns involving an entity of interest , such as a country , city , or organization .",
    "we use historical data of event mentions online , in particular forward - looking mentions of events yet to take place , to forecast the occurrence of these in the future .",
    "we can make predictions about particular timeframes in the future with high accuracy .",
    "we find that the mass of publicly available information online has the power to unveil the future actions of crowds .",
    "measuring the trends in sheer numbers we are here able to accurately predict protests in countries and in cities and large cyber campaigns by target and by perpetrator . after assembling our prediction mechanism for significant protests ,",
    "we investigate the case of the 2013 egyptian coup dtat and how well we were able to foresee the protests surrounding it .",
    "the ability to forecast these things has important ramifications .",
    "countries and cities faced with a high likelihood of significant protest can prepare themselves and their citizens to avoid any unnecessary violence and damages .",
    "companies with personnel and supply chain operations can ask their employees to stay at home and to remain apolitical and can attempt to safeguard their facilities in advance .",
    "countries , companies , and organizations faced with possible cyber campaigns against them can beef up their cyber security in anticipation of attacks or even preemptively address the cause for the anger directed at them .",
    "recent work has used online media to glean insight into consumer behavior . in @xcite",
    "the authors mine twitter for insights into consumer demand with an application to forecasting movie earnings . in @xcite",
    "the authors use blog chatter captured by ibm s webfountain @xcite to predict amazon book sales .",
    "these works are similar to this one in that they employ very large data sets and observe trends in crowd behavior by huge volumes .",
    "online web searches have been used to describe consumer behavior , most notably in @xcite and @xcite , and to predict movements in the stock market in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors study correlations between singular events with occurrence defined by coverage in the new york times . by studying",
    "when does one target event ensue another specified event sometime in the future , the authors discover truly novel correlations between events such as between natural disasters and disease outbreaks . here",
    "we are interested in the power of much larger , more social , and more varied datasets in pointing out early trends in endogenous processes ( actions by people discussed by people ) that can help predict all occurrences of an event and pinning down _",
    "when _ they will happen , measuring performance with respect to each time window for prediction .",
    "one example of the importance of a varied dataset that includes both social media and news in arabic is provided in the next section .",
    "we here seek to study the predictive power of such web intelligence data and not simply the power of standard machine learning algorithms ( e.g. random forests vs. svms ) .",
    "therefore we present only the learning machine ( random forest in the case of predicting protests ) that performed best on the training data and compare it to a data - poor maximum - likelihood random - walk predictor that predicts for the future the situation today .",
    "the data used in this study has been made available for download at www.nathankallus.com / predictingcrowdbehavior/.    we first discuss what predictive signals we expect to find in order to motivate our constructions .",
    "we then review how mentions of events , entities , and times are extracted from the wide breadth of sources . using this data",
    "we develop a predictive mechanism to predict significant protests in countries and in cities .",
    "we consider the case of the 2013 egyptian coup dtat and conclude . in an appendix",
    "we consider finding more general patterns in the data , motivating an application of the nave bayes classifier to high - dimensional sequence mining in massive datasets , which we use to forecast cyber attack campaigns by target or perpetrator .",
    "we begin by exemplifying anecdotally the precursory signals that exist in public data for large protests . on sunday june 9 , 2013 a beirut protest against hezbollah s interference in syria turned violent when clashes with hezbollah supporters left one protester dead @xcite .",
    "the story was widely reported on june 9 including in western media , attracting more mainstream news attention than any protest event in lebanon in over a year marking it as a _",
    "significant protest_.    but not only were there signs that the protest would occur before it did , there were signs it may be large and it may turn violent . the day before , algerian news source ennahar published an article with the headline `` lebanese faction organizes two demonstrations tomorrow rejecting the participation of hezbollah in the fighting in syria '' ( translated from arabic using google translate ) .",
    "there was little other preliminary mainstream coverage and no coverage ( to our knowledge ) appeared in mainstream media outside of the middle - east - north - africa ( mena ) region or in any language other than arabic .",
    "moreover , without further context there would be little evidence to believe that this protest , if it occurs at all , would become large enough or violent enough to garner mainstream attention from around the world .",
    "however , already by june 5 , four days earlier , there were many twitter messages calling people to protest on sunday , saying `` say no to # warcrimes and demonstrate against # hezbollah fighting in # qusayr on june 9 at 12 pm in downtown # beirut '' and `` protest against hezbollah being in # qusair next sunday in beirut . '' in addition , discussion around protests in lebanon has included particularly violent words in days prior .",
    "a june 6 article in theblaze.com reported , `` fatwa calls for suicide attacks against hezbollah , '' and a june 4 article in the pan - arabian news portal al bawaba reported that , `` since the revolt in syria , the security situation in lebanon has deteriorated . '' a may 23 article in the huffington post mentioned that , `` the revolt in syria has exacerbated tensions in lebanon , which ... remains deeply divided . '' within this wider context , understood through the lens of web - accessible public information such as mainstream reporting from around the world and social media , there was a significant likelihood that the protest would be large and turn violent .",
    "these patterns persist across time ; see figure [ lebpatterns ] .",
    "it is these predictive signals that we would like to mine from the web and employ in a learning machine in order to forecast significant protests and other crowd behavior . in this case , it is critical that we spread a wide net on many sources so to catch mentions in non - western media and foreign - language tweets along with mentions in media ( such as reuters ) and languages ( such as english ) with a more global reach .",
    "to quantify these signals we will look at time - stamped event - entity data .",
    "the data harvesting process extracts mentions of events from the plethora of documents continually gathered from the over 300,000 sources being monitored .",
    "an important aspect is that the event mentions are tagged with the time range in which the event is said to occur in the mention so that forward - looking statements , such as plans to protest , can be directly tied to a future time and place .",
    "event extractions are done in arabic , english , farsi , french , russian , spanish , and simplified and traditional chinese .",
    "there are several elements in the event , entity , and time extraction process . for each document mined from the web , an ensemble of off - the - shelf natural language processing tools",
    "are used to extract tokens ( lemma , root , stem , and part of speech ) and entities .",
    "entities extracted by each tool are then combined and resolved into a database of canonical entities for disambiguation .",
    "documents are categorized by topic .",
    "entities that are not agreed upon by the various tools and are far - fetched given the topic are rejected .",
    "ontologies of structured entity relationships constructed from online sources ( such as dbpedia ) are used to guide filtering and provide a gazetteer for additional entity extraction .",
    "given the set of filtered entities , a statement extractor links these entities to events stated in the document .",
    "events are again extracted using an ensemble method of off - the - shelf tools and a custom made tool that relies on the above tokenization .",
    "each event from the various extraction sources is matched up with a particular text fragment from the document that best represents it .",
    "next , @xmath0-grams in the document are matched against phrase lists organized by sentiment or tone and the fraction of these in the fragment is recorded .",
    "all time statements made in the document are separately extracted .",
    "the tokenization of the document is parsed by a dependency grammar using the data - driven parser maltparser @xcite to construct a dependency graph of the document .",
    "this is used to find time statements , both relative ( e.g. `` next summer '' ) and absolute .",
    "comprehending these in machine time is based on several contextual cues .",
    "cultural and regional categorizations are extracted from the document to inform such things as relevant hemisphere for seasons , which is the first day of the week , standard date formats ( month first or day first ) , and timezone .",
    "moreover , contexts such as publishing date are noted . using these , all time statements made in the document are converted to standardized time - stamps , with specificity varying from second to year .",
    "event mentions are then matched up with the most relevant time statement to the event statement based on sentence dependency .    in all , events are marked by type of event , time range of event , entities involved , role of entities involved , entities mentioned , sentiment and tone , and origin .",
    "some post - processing is done on the event - entity level to further improve quality based on special curated ontologies .",
    "for example , known hacker groups such as anonymous constitute one such ontology and if mentioned in a cyber event but not clearly as the perpetrator these are assumed to be so nonetheless . similarly , impossible events are rejected .",
    "for example , one ontology keeps track of death dates of people based primarily on information harvested from wikipedia and assists in rejecting the event `` marco polo will travel to china in 2015 '' as impossible because marco polo is dead .",
    "the precision of event extraction is measured by workers on the amazon mechanical turk ( mturkers ) . to test the precision of time - stamping , for each language language - specific human intelligence tasks ( hits )",
    "are constructed for a random sample .",
    "each hit consists of the text fragment , the extracted time - stamp , and the question `` is extracted time right or wrong ? '' and is given to three mturkers .",
    "it is declared successful if at least two answer `` right . '' for example , the precision of time - stamping in both english and spanish is measured at 93% , in arabic at 90% , and in simplified chinese at 82% .",
    "the precision of the event extraction is measured similarly by type .",
    "protest events in english come in at 84% .",
    "malware threat events in english come in at 96% and in simplified chinese at 90% .",
    ".protest event mentions in the corpus . [ cols=\"<,>,>,<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we first apply this method to predicting cyber campaigns against israel . for reference ,",
    "most of these are perpetrated by groups anonghost and anonymous under the banner of # opisrael .",
    "testing on april 2012 to july 2013 , we get a true positive rate of * 70.0% * and a true negative rate of * 67.8% * giving a balanced accuracy of * 68.9%*. our accuracy diminishes as we try to predict farther into the future , as depicted in figure [ fwdcyber ] .    by inspecting the trained conditional probabilities we can see which were the most impactful features to sway our belief one way or the other . in this case , swaying our belief most toward predicting",
    "positively were if many blog and mainstream mentions of cyber attack appeared in recent weeks and if many social media mentions of protest in israel appeared in recent weeks as well as forward - looking mentions on social media of a protest in the week to come .",
    "we apply the same method to predicting attacks against three other country entities and to predicting campaigns perpetrated by a selection of four hacktivist groups .",
    "the results are reported in table [ cybertable ] .",
    "where hacktivism campaigns are often reactions to developments that do not necessarily at first involve the hacktivist organization , incorporating in some way event mentions involving other entities could boost performance .",
    "however , it is not immediately clear how to do so without introducing too many redundant and obfuscating features that will result in overfitting and poor out - of - sample accuracy .",
    "using abstractions as in @xcite is one possible way to improve this method ."
