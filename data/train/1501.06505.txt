    "the quest for understanding the nature of recently discovered mesons and baryons is one of the most challenging topics in hadron physics .",
    "the traditional idea that they could be described as composite @xmath10 and @xmath11 objects has been reviewed to leave room for more complex structures involving more quarks in some cases @xcite .",
    "the application of chiral dynamics to the interaction of hadrons has had a significant success in recent years .",
    "an effective approach to qcd at low energy is provided by chiral lagrangians , in which mesons and baryons appear as fundamental degrees of freedom @xcite .    however , due to its limited range of convergence , the perturbation theory derived from these lagrangians , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath12 ) , proved insufficient to describe the hadron spectrum , and its non - perturbative unitary extension , called chiral unitary approach @xcite , became necessary .",
    "this new method allows us to explain many mesons and baryons as composite states of hadrons , among them the @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the @xmath2 , which are considered as dynamically generated resonances .    throughout this work",
    ", we will consider these resonances as dynamically generated from the interaction of two mesons , appearing as poles in the complex plane of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes are obtained using the tree level meson - meson interaction potentials , derived from the chiral lagrangians , as a kernel for the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled channels .",
    "the @xmath2 resonance appears , together with the block of axial vector mesons , from the pseudoscalar vector interaction in @xmath13 , @xmath14 , in coupled channels . in @xcite",
    "a speed plot of the amplitude was used to identify these resonances . in @xcite poles of the amplitudes in the complex plane",
    "were searched for in order to identify the resonances .",
    "an extension of the work of @xcite including higher orders in the potential is done in cite @xcite , where the results are also extrapolated to higher @xmath15 masses to match results of eventual qcd lattice results . in this latter work",
    "the effect of higher orders in the potential for the @xmath2 was found negligible .",
    "extrapolation of these ideas to the charm sector is done in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 resonance is peculiar in the sense that it comes from a single channel @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    "the building blocks of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the meson pairs @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath21 respectively @xcite .    since isospin symmetry is broken in meson rescattering due to the different masses of charged and neutral kaons , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 can mix , and quantifying this mixing can help understanding the nature of these two resonances . the topic was first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in @xcite , in which the reaction @xmath23 was studied .",
    "the same reaction was also studied in @xcite using the chiral unitary approach , as in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the reaction @xmath24 was also proposed as a test to measure the amount of @xmath25 mixing .",
    "the reaction @xmath23 was then studied at bes @xcite , where a narrow signal of the order of the difference of kaon masses , in agreement with the predictions of @xcite , was found , with an intensity of half percent with respect to the one of @xmath26 in the region of the @xmath5 peak of the @xmath22 distribution .",
    "the same experimental work reports also on the reaction @xmath27 in the region of the @xmath5 , finding again a very narrow signal with an intensity of half percent with respect to @xmath24 in the @xmath4 region .",
    "these findings are within expected values for isospin violation and the narrowness of the signal is tied to the mass difference between the kaons , which results in a difference between the loop functions for the intermediate kaons in the rescattering leading to the production of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these results provide support to the composite meson - meson nature of these resonances .    in a recent paper",
    "the bes team has reported a larger isospin violation in the decay @xmath28 compared to the @xmath29 , about @xmath30 @xcite , very difficult to explain unless one considers the @xmath31 as a mixture of @xmath13 and @xmath32 . however",
    ", this would lead to the production of the @xmath5 with its natural width , around @xmath33 mev , and not with the one of about @xmath34 mev observed by bes .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a particular mechanism was proposed to study these processes , consisting in the @xmath31 decaying into @xmath35 , the posterior @xmath36 decay into @xmath37 and the rescattering of the @xmath21 to produce either the @xmath5 and the @xmath4 resonances .",
    "this leads to a triangular loop diagram that has two cuts ( singularities in the integrand ) , which make it different from the standard g loop function from @xmath21 , with only the @xmath21 on shell singularity .",
    "the final loop function that appeared in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , containing the three propagators , was divergent and needed to be regularized . in ref .",
    "@xcite wu _ et al .",
    "_ used an unknown cutoff or form factor to implement convergence , but then the decay rates were dependent on an unknown parameter .",
    "the problem was solved in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of the chiral unitary approach and it was shown that the triangular loop could be regularized with the same cutoff used in the meson - meson interaction problem , which is a parameter fitted to the scattering data that naturally appears in the calculation . this made possible to evaluate the ratio of the decay rates for @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the shapes of the invariant mass distributions , which were in good agreement with experiment .    in this work",
    "we will apply the same mechanism of refs .",
    "@xcite to the reactions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we follow the steps of ref .",
    "@xcite and evaluate the branching ratio for the decay of the @xmath2 to @xmath42 , excluding the @xmath4 decay to @xmath21 , in order to compare our result with the value reported in the pdg , with the aim to give further support to the basic idea about the nature of the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances .",
    "we want to study the decay of the @xmath2 to @xmath42 , excluding the @xmath4 decay to @xmath21 , which according to the pdg @xcite , makes up for a sizeable fraction of the total @xmath2 decay width of @xmath43 . in addition , we will simultaneously study the reactions @xmath44 and @xmath45 to make an estimate of the amount of @xmath25 mixing .",

    "we find that the mechanism , which we can evaluate in absolute terms , provides a large branching fraction for the @xmath2 decay of about 30% , in agreement with experiment . at the same time",

    "the width of this peak is found narrow , like in the @xmath8 which was measured experimentally , and does not reflect the natural width of the @xmath5 resonance but simply the region where the mass difference of the charged and neutral kaons is appreciable compared to the value of their masses .",
    "we find that the shape obtained is similar to the one found in the @xmath218 and @xmath219 , but the amount of isospin breaking is quite different to either reaction , showing once more that the concept of a universal mixing of the @xmath5-@xmath4 is not adequate , and the nature of these resonances as dynamically generated makes the isospin mixing very strongly dependent on the physical process .",

    "<S> we evaluate the decay width for the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 taking into account that all three resonances are dynamically generated from the meson - meson interaction , the @xmath2 from @xmath3 and the @xmath4 , @xmath5 from @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we use a triangular mechanism similar to that of the @xmath8 , which provides a decay width for @xmath0 with a branching fraction of the order of 30% , in agreement with experiment . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the decay width for the isospin forbidden @xmath1 , which appears when we consider different masses for the charged and neutral kaons , and show that it is much more suppressed than in the @xmath8 case , but gives rise to a narrow shape of the @xmath9 distribution similar to the one found in the @xmath8 decay .    </S>"
