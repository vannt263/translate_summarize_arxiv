    "like the cuprate high-@xmath3 superconductors , the more recently discovered iron pnictide superconductors @xcite also exhibit interesting magnetic properties.@xcite while the antiferromagnetism of the mott - insulating parent compounds of the cuprates can be very well accounted for by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath4 heisenberg model,@xcite there is no such simple reference point for the fe pnictides , in which the electrons are always itinerant .",
    "quantum spin models have nevertheless been employed @xcite to describe some of their intriguing magnetic properties , as more manageable alternatives to t - j @xcite or hubbard @xcite models of itinerant electrons .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath5 ( nel ) order of the cuprates , most of the pnictides exhibit @xmath0 `` stripe '' order , which can be achieved with frustrated spin models.@xcite an on - going theoretical challenge is to explain,@xcite in a general sense , the ordered moments , which are often anomalously small but vary considerably among different compounds.@xcite    we here address this issue , as well as other generic aspects of multi - orbital magnetism , using a model with two electronic spins per lattice site .",
    "while the neglect of the charge degrees of freedom will clearly also affect the magnetic properties to some extent , it is still interesting and important to ask the question of whether a correct effective low - energy description of the magnetic properties of the fe pnictides is possible within such a simplified spin - only model .",
    "the two - orbital spin system should be much more realistic in this regard than the often used models with single @xmath4 or @xmath6 spins on the sites.@xcite we will include in the two - spin description an on - site hund s coupling , as well as inter- and intra - orbital exchange between nearest and next - nearest - neighbor spins .    studying this highly frustrated quantum spin system with a cluster - mean - field method ( a variational cluster - product - state ansatz where the wave function on small clusters is optimized fully ) , we find a very rich phase diagram , including a regime in which the behavior seems appropriate for describing the small - moment stripe antiferromagnetism of the pnictides .",
    "the valence electrons in the fe pnictides reside predominantly in fe @xmath7 orbitals . in a simplified picture",
    "suitable for some compounds , the low - energy bands @xcite can be reproduced using only @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals @xcite ( although in some cases other orbitals may also be needed @xcite ) . in undoped systems",
    "there are two electrons per fe in this case . despite the electron itineracy",
    ", it has been argued that the magnetic properties are still correctly maintained upon further reducing the two - orbital hubbard model to a `` double - spin '' model ( dsm),@xcite where two localized @xmath4 spin degrees of freedom per lattice site are retained .",
    "the `` a '' and `` b '' spins are coupled to each other intra - site by a ferromagnetic hund s coupling @xmath10 , and significant inter - site couplings should extend up to second - nearest neighbors on the square lattice of iron ions .",
    "these interactions originate from superexchange through as ions.@xcite    the spin - only description of course neglects some important aspects of the pnictides . one appealing proposal to explain their small and highly varying magnetic moments is a `` semi - localized '' picture , in which the electrons on one orbital are essentially localized , while those on the second orbital form an itinerant band.@xcite the two - orbital spin - only description would then amount to a effective spin - localized description also of the itinerant electrons . whether or not such a model can still correctly capture the low - energy magnetic properties is an interesting and important generic question .",
    "the aim of our work reported here is to establish some aspects of the phase diagram of the dsm more completely than in past studies,@xcite as a starting point for investigating the low - energy physics in various phases and the nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different types of ground states .",

    "we count the a - b cross - terms only once , i.e. , @xmath17 in the sum over orbitals .",
    "this model has up until now been studied only in a very limited range of its parameter space.@xcite we here report much more extensive investigations , using a variational cluster - product wave - function ansatz .",
    "our primary goal is to determine whether the dsm can provide a semi - quantitative , universal description of the magnetism of the pnictides and insights into their effective magnetic interactions . to address the issue of typically small but highly varying ordered moments in the @xmath0 stripe phase , we take the view that the wide range of moments should originate from a sensitivity of the system to details of the effective spin couplings .",
    "it should therefore be possible to achieve small moments for a wide range of parameters in the dsm .",
    "the sensitivity should not require the proximity of a quantum - critical point , which seems to require too much fine - tuning to be generic .",
    "note that the variations in the moments are not only large among different members of the fe pnictide family , but the moment of a given system can also be sensitive to pressure.@xcite    we also emphasize that the dsm is not just of interest in the context of the fe pnictides , but also represents an intriguing and important quantum spin model in its own right , with potential applications to other multi - orbital quantum magnets .",
    "it is interesting , e.g. , to observe how the dsm evolves into an @xmath6 system with increasing hund s coupling .",
    "more generally , we are interested in the quantum many - body states that can form in this system due to the two - orbital spin physics , beyond the known ground states of single - orbital @xmath4 systems and @xmath6 ( @xmath18 ) systems .    using the variational cluster mean - field method with fully optimized cluster wave functions , as described in more detail below , in sec .",

    "having two coupled spins per site , it is also much more complex than the @xmath4 @xmath24-@xmath25 heisenberg model.@xcite spin - wave theory @xcite and exact diagonalization @xcite have been used to study some regions of its parameter space . retaining only @xmath10 and the orbit - diagonal couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", manousakis discovered a canted phase with a @xmath28 unit cell ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]),@xcite in addition to the nel and stripe states .",
    "he also suggested a non - magnetic phase for large @xmath10 .",
    "rodriguez and rezayi @xcite focused on completely different parameters , with only cross - orbital interactions @xmath29 and @xmath30 and weak hund s coupling .",
    "states with `` hidden order '' then appear ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) where nel or ferromagnetic order is present but macroscopically invisible because spins on the same site are anti - parallel ( overcoming @xmath10 ) and lead to no net moment ( if the effective @xmath31-factors of the two electrons are equal ) .",
    "these parameters do not seem appropriate for the pnictides , however , and the kinds of hidden order also seem inappropriate , because it does not correspond to the commonly observed @xmath0 stripes in the fe pnictides .",
    "the full phase diagram of the dsm ( [ ham1 ] ) has not been studied so far . even in the regions already studied , the methods used may not be completely reliable , due to the inherent difficulties with spin - wave theory when the quantum fluctuations are significant and the small lattices in exact diagonalization .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate the dsm for a wider range of parameters and using alternative methods .",
    "the variational approach used here is based on factoring of the ground state of the system on the infinite lattice into a product of cluster states , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the wave function of cluster @xmath34 .",
    "we here use the standard basis of z - component spin eigenstates and write the state of a cluster of @xmath35 sites as @xmath36 imposing the constraint of all the cluster wave functions being identical corresponds to periodicity with a maximal unit cell given by the cluster used and mean - field cluster boundaries,@xcite i.e. , the interactions between different clusters factor into expectation value taken over two independent clusters . since all clusters have the same wave function , these expectation values just depend on a single cluster . in principle one may also extend the scheme to a product of different , collectively optimized cluster states ( to allow for , e.g. , magnetic order with larger periodicity ) , but we will not consider this generalization here .      using clusters of size @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we have fully optimized the wave function ( which for the dsm has @xmath39 coefficients ) by minimizing the total energy , @xmath40 with respect to the parameters @xmath41 . to minimize @xmath42 , we also compute its derivatives with respect to all the parameters .",
    "it is useful to divide the energy into its diagonal ( dia ) and off - diagonal ( off ) parts , e.g. , for the standard heisenberg model ( single - orbital ) these are given by @xmath43 and the generalization to the dsm energy is trivial .",
    "the general expressions for the diagonal and off - diagonal contributions to the energy derivatives are @xmath44 where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 is restricted to a single cluster and the mean - field decoupled inter - cluster interactions discussed above are included .",
    "the cluster - variational ( cv ) method outlined above is in practice very similar to the `` hierarchical mean - field theory '' @xcite ( producing identical results for systems such as the @xmath24-@xmath25 model @xcite ) , which in the past has been applied to several frustrated spin models .",
    "our method of constructing the wave function by direct energy minimization is different , however .",
    "we do not make any assumptions regarding the form of the cluster wave function , treating all the coefficients in ( [ psicdef ] ) as completely independent variational parameters .",
    "we normally do not implement any symmetries ( which would reduce the number of variational parameters ) in order to not potentially miss any states . in principle symmetries",
    "can also be easily incorporated in our scheme .",
    "note that the magnetization @xmath47 on the cluster is not conserved in general , but when studying the colinear states , such as the nel and stripe states , one can restric the wave function to the sector @xmath48 to reduce the number of parameters . in unrestricted simulations",
    "the optimization does not necessarily find this subspace , because the spin - rotational symmetry is not broken explicitly ( only spontaneously ) and a state with @xmath49 in any direction @xmath20 can be generated .",
    "all these solutions are degenerate and this is manifested in our calculations .",
    "we find the optimum using a combination of the steepest - decent method and a stochastic approach where only the signs of the derivatives are used,@xcite with the latter useful at the initial stage where it is important to avoid getting stuck in local minimums , and the latter working well at the final stage where the solution is close to optimal .",
    "for the models considered here , we have not encountered any significant problems with this optimization scheme , even when the number of variational parameters is as large as @xmath50 ( for a @xmath51 single - orbital @xmath4 heisenberg model or a @xmath52 cluster of the dsm ) .",
    "we here focus on the magnetic structure and define the nel ( @xmath53 ) and stripe ( @xmath54 ) order parameters @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the integer - valued site coordinates .",
    "naturally , these quantities as well can be expressed using only a single cluster in the cv scheme .",
    "the cv ansatz can break spin and lattice symmetries , but we do not impose how they are broken .",
    "we therefore compute the magnitudes of the full vector quantities ( [ m1def ] ) and ( [ m2def ] ) . in the case of stripes , @xmath54 corresponds to@xmath0 order ( vertical stripes ) , but we also compute the @xmath57 order parameter and use whichever one ( if any ) is nonzero .",
    "in addition to the order parameters we also compute the canting angle @xmath20 and the on - site separation angle @xmath23 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in calculations with @xmath38 clusters",
    "we compute the magnetic properties on the central @xmath28 plaquette .",
    "the magnetic structure within linear spin - wave theory is obtained by minimizing the classical energy , with quantum fluctuations only reducing ( or possibly destroying ) that order .",
    "we will compare some of our results with spin wave theory .",
    "the cv method includes local quantum fluctuations within the clusters , and by using different cluster sizes we can check the stability of any states found . in practice",
    "we are of course limited to very small clusters , and can not in general carry out completely unbiased extrapolations .",
    "the method nevertheless goes well beyond classical or standard mean - field approaches .",
    "the cv method should also lead to faster convergence with the cluster size in ordered phases ( if this order is commensurate with the cluster structure ) than standard exact diagonalization techniques .",
    "we here discuss several aspects of the phase diagram , starting with the case of @xmath18 ( the spin-@xmath58 heisenberg model ) and then several other phases obtaining for finite @xmath10 , including the parameter region we believe is appropriate for the pnictides .      ) and stripe ( @xmath54 ) order parameters of the @xmath59 dsm when the only non - zero parameter is @xmath60 .",

    "we define @xmath60 ( and all other parameters are zero ) .",
    "classically , there is then a first - order transition between the nel and stripe states at @xmath63 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , within the cv approach with clusters of size @xmath28 and @xmath38 , this transition moves only slightly , to @xmath64 .    in linear spin - wave theory",
    "there is a narrow region at @xmath65 where both ordered moments vanish ( strictly speaking becoming negative , indicating a break - down of the approximation ) .",
    "manousakis found that this behavior also persists for large but finite hund s coupling , and , thus , that there is possibly a non - magnetic state intervening between the nel and stripe phases .",
    "there is no explicit sign of such a state within the cv calculations , however .",
    "the nel order drops significantly before the first - order stripe transition , and the drop increases with the cluster size . such a drop is always expected in the presence of quantum fluctuations . in principle",
    "we can not exclude that this behavior evolves with increasing cluster size into two independent transitions with an intervening non - magnetic state in between .",
    "in the @xmath4 @xmath24-@xmath25 model it is well known that a nonmagnetic state exists for @xmath66.@xcite this state is likely a valence - bond - solid,@xcite although some calculations instead have indicated a spin - liquid.@xcite a nonmagnetic state in the dsm , if it exists , should then be the @xmath6 version of such a state ( which can exist @xcite for @xmath67 but is less studied than @xmath4 ) . considering that the @xmath31-window of the nonmagnetic phase is already small in the @xmath4 case , it should be very small indeed for @xmath6 ( since it must vanish in the classical , @xmath68 limit ) and it is also possible that it is non - existent already for @xmath6 .",
    "the transition should then be first order on generic symmetry grounds .",
    "it is interesting to note that the location of the nel to stripe transition is almost identical for the two cluster sizes , suggesting that the transition point is accurately converged .",
    "moreover , the location also is close to the point obtained within a self - consistent harmonic approach.@xcite note also that both ordered moments decrease with increasing cluster size .",

    "the quantum phase transitions involving the canted state are clearly discontinuous for large @xmath10 but become more smooth as @xmath10 is reduced .    the phase diagram in the @xmath72 plane is shown in fig .  [ fig3](b ) .",
    "the size of the canted phase is smaller than in spin - wave ( classical ) theory,@xcite but the fact that the boundaries are barely shifted when increasing the cluster size from @xmath28 to @xmath38 suggests that the state indeed exists and the computed phase boundaries should be stable .    in a collinear state , such as those in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the ground state is in the sector of magnetization @xmath48 .",
    "the canted state is a non - collinear ( co - planar ) , however , and , thus , its ground state should mix different magnetization sectors ( regardless of the quantization axis chosen ) .",
    "we can confirm this explicitly by comparing the cv optimized energy in the full hilbert space of the cluster with that obtained in calculations restricted to @xmath48 .",

    "it is then possible to tune the net stripe moment over a wide range of small to large values .",
    "this turns out to be the case only if the second cross - orbital coupling @xmath30 is _ ferromagnetic _ , in which case this coupling favors a and b stripes out - of - phase with respect to each other ( and also further stabilize the stripes ) .",
    "the hund s coupling must be small to moderate ; up to @xmath85 times the largest exchange constant .",
    "this is perhaps smaller than expected in the fe pnictides,@xcite but here it should be kept in mind that the bare @xmath10 ( in an electronic model including the charge degrees of freedom ) should be renormalized when reducing the itinerant description to a localized - spin model . with localized spins ,",
    "the effects of the hund s coupling is naturally stronger , and , therefore , its bare value is renormalized down from its itinerant - electron value .",
    "all the other couplings can be antiferromagnetic , but a ferromagnetic @xmath29 also helps to stabilize stripes .    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows an example of the evolution of the separation angle and the ordered moments as a function of @xmath30 when all other couplings are held constant at physically reasonable @xcite values of order @xmath58 ( using @xmath26 as the energy unit ) .",
