    "the most important and relevant physical processes are ( 1 ) the interaction between neutral gas and near  photons emitted by the central host galaxy , which couples the spin temperature of the igm to its kinetic temperature ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1958 ) , and ( 2 ) the interaction between neutral gas and ionizing uv and soft x - ray photons emanating from the host galaxy , which provides a heating source for the otherwise cold igm up to some small radius . in the absence of heating the kinetic temperature @xmath23 of",
    "the igm would be equal to @xmath24 ( for the redshift range of interest here ) since beginning of decoupling with cmb at @xmath25 ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "we perform spherically the transfer of uv and soft x - ray radiation from the host galaxy outward to compute ( 1 ) the development of the hii region around the galaxy as a function of time , ( 2 ) the evolution of the temperature of the surrounding igm , subject to uv and soft x - ray heating by the host galaxy , as a function of radius and time , and ( 3 ) the  coupling coefficient @xmath26 as a function of radius and time .",
    "we assume a uniform igm density equal to the mean gas density of the universe ( i.e. , @xmath27 in equation 1 below ) .",
    "two scenarios of metal - free star formation in first galaxies are considered : ( 1 ) all stars have a single mass of @xmath28 ( vms ) , advocated by oh ( 2001 ) and qian & wasserburg ( 2002 ) , and ( 2 ) an imf has the salpeter slope of @xmath29 with a lower cutoff of @xmath30 and an upper cutoff of @xmath31 ( sal ) , close to what favored by umeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) , tumlinson , venkatesan , & shull ( 2004 ) and tan & mckee ( 2004 ) .",
    "we adopt the library of stellar spectra and ages from schaerer ( 2002 ) ; we use a black - body radiation spectrum for each star of chosen mass with an effective surface temperature from table 3 of schaerer ( 2002 ) but slightly adjusted so as to produce the correct ratio of the number of photons above helium ii lyman limit to the number of photons above hydrogen lyman limit , averaged over the lifetime of each star ( see table 4 of schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "we use an escape fraction for lyman limit photons @xmath18 from the host galaxy and self - consistently a frequency dependent escape fraction for other uv and soft x - ray photons assuming that they are subject to the same absorbing column in the galaxy .",
    "all escaped photons ( emerging from the virial radius ) are then subject to the ( time - dependent ) combined absorption of h i , he i and he ii in the igm , self - consistently computed . since the  scattering region is mostly neutral with a residual ionized fraction of @xmath32 left from recombination ( peebles 1993 ) , we assume that @xmath33 of x - ray energy is used to heat the gas ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) with the heating rate per hydrogen atom at radius @xmath34 computed with the following formula : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the luminosity per unit frequency of the galaxy ; @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are ionization potentials of h , he i and he ii , respectively ; @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are photo - ionization cross - sections of h , he i and he ii , respectively ; @xmath43 is ratio of helium number density to hydrogen number density ; @xmath44 is the optical depth from the galaxy to radius @xmath34 at frequency @xmath45 .    the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen ( field 1958 , 1959 ) is then given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the collisional coupling coefficient with the collisional de - excitation rate @xmath48 , @xmath49 taken from zygelman ( 2005 ) , @xmath50 is the mean hydrogen density and @xmath51  k is the hydrogen hyperfine energy splitting . in the expression for the  coupling coefficient @xmath52 , @xmath53  s@xmath54 is spontaneous emission coefficient of the 21-cm line , the indirect de - excitation rate @xmath55 of the hyperfine structure levels is related to the total   scattering rate @xmath56 by @xmath57 ( field 1958 ) .",
    "here @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the  photon flux ( in units of @xmath60  s@xmath54 ) and @xmath61 being the cross section for  scattering ( mmr ) , where @xmath62  cm is the wavelength of the  line , @xmath63  s@xmath54 is the spontaneous einstein coefficient for  line and @xmath64 is the normalized  line ( voigt ) profile with @xmath65 .",
    "most of the  scattering is accomplished by uv photons slightly on the blue side of the   that redshift into  resonant line due to the hubble expansion ( note that @xmath66 due to hubble expansion at @xmath67mpc comoving ) , not the intrinsic  line photons that escape from the host galaxy and redshift to the damping wing ( madau , meiksin , & rees 1997 ; mmr ) .",
    "additional physical processes that were not treated previously , including higher - order lyman lines that result in cascade in two - photon emission , fine structure of  resonance and spin - flip scattering , introduce corrections of order unity to @xmath56 ( cm ; hirata 2005 ; chuzhoy & shapiro 2005 ) but all these corrections terms are insignificant for our case , and we only apply the relatively large correction term @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) as shown in figure 4 of cm due to a spectral shape change near  .",
    "the observed brightness temperature increment / decrement against the cmb is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is gas overdensity relative to the mean , @xmath72 neutral hydrogen fraction , @xmath73  k cmb temperature and other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "-0.9 cm    figure 2 shows the profile of @xmath74 for four cases of halo masses with each choice of imf .",
    "let us examine each of the four regions ( sketched in figure 1 ) with respect to 21-cm observations .",
    "inside the virial radius ( the red circle in figure 1 ) the gas is overdense with @xmath75 and a positive large - amplitude emission signal may result , if a significant amount of neutral hydrogen gas exists within .",
    "however , the size of this regions falls below @xmath76 and its signal is unlikely to be detectable in the foreseeable future .",
    "the h ii region ( inside the blue circle in figure 1 ) is ionized hence @xmath77 . in the region outside the  scattering region (",
    "exterior to the green region in figure 1 ) the spin temperature of the igm has been progressively attracted to the temperature of the cmb with gradually weakening coupling to the gas kinetic temperature by atomic collisions , producing a small but non - negligible 21-cm absorption signal at the redshift of interest ( @xmath78 ) ( loeb & zaldarriaga 2004 ) .",
    "it is the  scattering region that is of most interest here . in the inner part of the  scattering region ( shown in magenta in figure 1 )",
    "the igm is significantly heated by uv and soft x - ray photons to exceed the cmb temperature , while its spin temperature is very strongly coupled to its kinetic temperature by  scattering . as a result , the inner radial region at @xmath79  mpc / h comoving for minihalos and @xmath80  mpc / h comoving for large halos displays an emission signal against cmb with an amplitude of @xmath81  mk ( a shark dorsal fin - like feature in figure 2 ) .",
    "going outward ( shown in green in figure 1 ) , the soft x - ray heating abates ( because the cumulative optical depth to these photons increases quickly ) but the  scattering remains strong , up to a distance of about @xmath82  mpc / h comoving .",
    "consequently , a strong 21-cm absorption signal against the cmb with an amplitude of @xmath83  mk at @xmath84mhz ( for @xmath1 ) on a scale of @xmath85  mpc / h comoving , corresponding to an angular scale of @xmath8 , is produced for large halos .",
    "this is the 21-cm absorption halo  a unique and strong feature for the large first galaxies .",
    "we note that the absorption signal cast by minihalos ( the two top sets of thin curves in each panel in figure 2 ) is relatively weak due to a combination of low mass and low star formation efficiency .",
    "we will therefore focus on large halos for practical observability purposes .",
    "besides stars , no other soft x - ray source in the galaxy is assumed to concurrently exist .",
    "we shall examine the validity of this assumption in detail .",
    "the density of the interstellar medium plays an important role for some of the potentially relevant processes considered here and it is assumed to be @xmath86 , where local interstellar density @xmath87  @xmath88 .",
    "this assumption should hold in hierarchical structure formation model for the following reasons .",
    "the mean gas density scales as @xmath89 and halos at low and high redshift in cosmological simulations show similarities when density and length are measured in their respective comoving units ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; del popolo 2001 ) .",
    "the spin parameters ( i.e. , angular momentum distribution ) of both high and low redshift halos have very similar distributions peaking at a nearly identical value @xmath90 ( peebles 1969 ; white 1984 ; barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; ueda 1994 ; steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; bullock 2001 ) .",
    "thus , cooling gas in galaxies at low and high redshift should collapse by a similar factor before the structure becomes dynamically stable ( e.g. , rotation support sets in ) , resulting in interstellar densities scaling as @xmath89 . direct simulations ( abel 2002 ; bromm 2002 ) suggest a gas density of @xmath91@xmath88 by the end of the initial free fall for minihalos at @xmath92 , verifying this simple analysis",
    ".    we will estimate each of several possible types of soft x - ray emission sources in turn .",
    "first , let us estimate soft x - ray emission from supernova remnants . assuming the standard cooling curve ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) we find that at @xmath93 a supernova blastwave with an initial explosion energy of @xmath94  erg ( for a star of mass @xmath28 ; e.g.",
    ", heger & woosley 2002 ) would enter its rapid cooling phase at a temperature of @xmath95  k. this implies that the energy emitted at @xmath96  ev from the cooling shell is about @xmath97 .",
    "a @xmath28 mass would release @xmath98  erg total energy due to nuclear burning , out of which @xmath99 is released in photons at @xmath100ev for our adopted radiation spectrum .",
    "therefore , the ratio of total photon energy from the supernova remnant to that from the star is @xmath101 .",
    "thus , for the vms imf , stellar soft x - ray appears to dominate over that from its supernova remnant .",
    "the soft x - ray contribution from supernova remnant cooling increases relatively compared to that from the star itself with decreasing stellar mass and we estimate that the overall contribution from the two components may become comparable for the sal imf case , averaged over time .",
    "second , we will examine x - rays produced from cooling of supernova - accelerated relativistic electrons by cmb photons via inverse compton ( ic ) process ( e.g. , oh 2001 ) .",
    "for adiabatic shocks , as is appropriate in our case , the ic spectral energy distribution has a two - power - law form : @xmath102  constant at @xmath103 and @xmath104 at @xmath105 .",
    "the break energy is @xmath106  kev , independent of redshift with the assumed scaling of the interstellar medium density with redshift",
    ". then the ratio of energy from ic to that from stars is found to be @xmath107 in the @xmath100ev band , depending on the exact upper energy cutoff ( assuming @xmath108 of supernova explosion energy is utilized to accelerate relativistic electrons in shocks ) .",
    "clearly , contribution to soft x - rays from ic process is unimportant .",
    "third , x - ray binaries during the relatively short lifetime of massive stars may be rare , for top - heavy imfs of concern here .",
    "we can make an estimate based on the calculation by rappaport , podsiadlowski & pfahl ( 2005 ) , who give an ultra luminous x - ray binary formation rate of @xmath109 per supernova .",
    "it is clear that even if each x - ray binary is able to release as much energy as in a supernova explosion itself and all in the soft x - ray band , the resulting contribution will be less than a fraction of a percent of that from stars .",
    "fourth , stellar mass black holes ( bh ) of @xmath110 may be produced in significant numbers with a top - heavy imf as well as a central galactic bh .",
    "it seems that stellar bh accretion is likely significantly suppressed and small due to feedback effect from stars on surrounding gas ( e.g. , mori , umemura , & ferrara 2004 ; alvarez , bromm , & shapiro 2005 ) .",
    "a concomitant contribution of soft x - rays from central bh accretion in the lifetime of a @xmath28 star is approximately @xmath111 , after inserting soft x - ray emission fraction for a @xmath28 stellar spectrum of @xmath112 , stellar lifetime @xmath113  yrs and eddington time @xmath114  yrs , where @xmath115 is the energy fraction released by the bh accretion in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath100ev ) .",
    "thus , if the ratio of black hole mass to ( bulge ) stellar mass follows the local magorrian ( magorrian 1998 ) relation , then , unless most of the accretion energy is released in the soft x - ray band , contribution from central bh accretion to the soft x - ray band is relatively small .",
    "fifth , thermal bremsstrahlung emission from gravitational shock heated gas is likely negligible due to a low gas temperature ( @xmath116k ) .",
    "finally , soft x - rays from massive first stars themselves are thought to be produced by stellar winds and quite uncertain .",
    "recent work suggests that the winds hence soft x - ray emission from metal - free stars are expected to be insignificant ( e.g. , krticka & kubat 2005 ) . in summary , soft x - rays from neglected",
    ", possible sources other than that from the stellar photospheres would , at most , make a modest correction to what is adopted in our calculation . to ascertain our conclusion , we compute a case with the amplitude of soft x - ray intensity at @xmath117  ev artificially raised by a factor of @xmath82 and do not find any significant effect that would qualitatively change our results ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the reason is that the igm quickly becomes optically thick to a few @xmath118ev soft x - ray photons at @xmath119  mpc comoving .",
    "therefore , our results should be quite robust .",
    "-0.5 cm    since we are concerned with gas of relatively low temperature @xmath120k , heating by a cumulative ( hard ) x - ray background may become relevant at some redshift .",
    "we estimate when this may happen in the cdm model .",
    "while an x - ray background may be generated by a variety of processes , black hole accretion at the centers of galaxies are thought to be the most dominant ( e.g. , ricotti & ostriker 2003 ; kuhlen & madau 2005 ) , estimated as follows .",
    "let us suppose the energy extraction efficiency from black accretion is @xmath121 and a fraction @xmath122 of the released energy is in the form of hard x - rays .",
    "then , the x - rays may collectively heat up the igm temperature at most ( ignoring compton cooling and assuming all x - ray photons in the background are consumed by the igm ) by an increment @xmath123 ( assuming 14% of x - ray energy is used to heat the igm ; shull & van steenberg 1985 ) , where @xmath124 is the fraction of matter that has collapsed to halos where stars have formed . under the reasonable assumption that the parameters have their adopted fiducial values ( for @xmath121 see yu & tremaine 2002 , @xmath122 see elvis 1994 , for @xmath17 see gnedin 2000 )",
    ", it becomes evident that , for the very first galaxies formed in the universe that comprise a collapsed mass fraction less than @xmath125 , heating of the igm by an x - ray background radiation field may be small .",
    "figure 3 shows cumulative halo mass functions at redshift @xmath126 , based on press - schechter ( 1974 ) formalism ( using @xmath127 and the standard model of spergel 2003 ) , which should be accurate for the exponentially falling regime of interest here ( sheth & tormen 1999 ; jenkins 2001 ) .",
    "figure 3 suggests that at redshift @xmath128 heating of the igm by an x - ray background is small .",
    "neglected contributions to the x - ray background from other sources ( x - ray binaries , supernova remnants , etc ) ( e.g. , oh 2001 , cen 2003 ) will likely just add a modest numerical correction factor for equation ( 2 ) and the net effect , if any , would push the epoch for significant heating by an x - ray background to a slightly higher redshift ( note that structure formation is exponentially increasing with decreasing redshift at @xmath1 ) . but even a factor of a few upward correction to equation ( 2 ) would still leave the temperature of igm @xmath93 relatively unaffected by an x - ray background .    another critical issue is whether heating of igm by  photons is important .",
    "in a recent accurate calculation based on fokker - planck approximation , chen & miralda - escud ( 2004 ; cm ) show that the heating rate by  photons is much lower than previous estimates ( mmr ) .",
    "we recast their important result ( equation 17 of cm and using figure 3 of cm ) , the heating rate per hydrogen atom and per hubble time , @xmath129 , in the following way : @xmath130 at @xmath93 , where @xmath131 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath132 is the hubble constant and @xmath133  s@xmath54 is the thermalization rate for  scattering at @xmath93 , above which  scattering brings down the spin temperature to the gas kinetic temperature ( mmr ) .",
    "the hubble time is @xmath134  yrs at @xmath93 .",
    "so , over the duration of a stellar lifetime @xmath135  yrs ( of the least massive stars in our model , @xmath30 ) , the gas will be heated up by @xmath136  k at @xmath137 .",
    "for the regime of interest where we see the strong 21-cm absorption signal ( figure 2 ) we find @xmath138 .",
    "thus , heating of surrounding igm by  photons emanating from the host galaxy can be safely neglected .",
    "in addition , since we are concerned with early times when the universe is far from being ionized and the number of  photons per hydrogen atom is significantly less than unity , indicating that heating by the background  photons can also be safely neglected ( cm ) .",
    "furthermore , heating rate by high order lyman series photons is still lower and thus negligible ( pritchard & furlanetto 2005 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated a unique feature of first galaxies . a large 21-cm survey of the first galaxies will be invaluable .",
    "demanding that each of the physical quantities be resolved by a factor of @xmath82 would translate to the following requirements : an angular resolution of @xmath139 , a spectral resolution of @xmath140khz ( @xmath141khz across a radius of @xmath142mpc / h at @xmath93 due to the hubble expansion ) and a sensitivity of @xmath143  mk at @xmath5  mhz . among the next generation of radio telescopes currently under construction",
    "/ consideration , lofar ( http://www.lofar.org ) appears to be best positioned to be able to carry out such a survey , at least for some of the brighter and larger galaxies .",
    "lofar is currently designed to reach a frequency as low as @xmath82mhz with an angular resolution of @xmath144 at @xmath5mhz , a sensitivity of @xmath82  mk and a spectral resolution ( i.e. , processing capability ) of @xmath142  khz ( e.g. , rottgering 2003 ) , while mwa ( http://web.haystack.mit.edu/arrays/mwa/index.html ) , past ( http://web.phys.cmu.edu/@xmath145past/index.html ) and ska ( http://www.skatelescope.org ) appear to be placed out of the @xmath5mhz range , as they stand now .    -0.9",
    "cm    figure 4 shows the density of galaxies versus the maximum absorption cross section ( i.e. , in the plane of the large circle centered on the galaxy perpendicular to the line of sight ) with @xmath146  mk .",
    "here we point out four fundamental and potentially ground - breaking applications regarding cosmology and galaxy formation , if a 21-cm tomographic survey of galaxies in the redshift shell @xmath1 is carried out , which may be able to detect millions of galaxies .",
    "first , a characteristic sharp fall - off at @xmath147 square arcseconds and a characteristic peak of the number of 21-cm absorption halos is expected , as seen in figure 4 due to a lower star formation efficiency in ( and low mass of ) minihalos , as suggested by available simulations ( abel 2002 ) .",
    "this should yield direct information on physics of cooling and star formation in first galaxies , which may be unobtainable otherwise by any other means in the foreseeable future .",
    "note that the left cutoff and the peak density are functions of @xmath17 and @xmath148 ( noting the differences between sal and vms cases in figure 4 ) , where @xmath148 denotes dependence on the properties of imf such as stellar lifetime and spectrum . a full parameter space exploration will be given in a separate paper with more detailed treatments .",
    "we expect that @xmath17 and @xmath148 may be determined separately , when jointly analyzed with the density of absorption halos in the context of the standard cdm model .",
    "second , we see that the density of strong 21-cm absorption halos depends strongly on @xmath149 , as testified by the large difference ( a factor of @xmath150 ) between solid and dotted curves in figure 4 .",
    "one may then obtain a constraint on @xmath149 , which is made possible because the effect due to difference in imf may be isolated out , as discussed above , thanks to the features in the density of absorption halos ( e.g. , peak location and sharp fall - off at the low end ) .",
    "let us estimate a possible accuracy of such measurements .",
    "at @xmath151h@xmath152mpc@xmath153 one would find 0.1 million galaxies in the redshift shell between @xmath154 and @xmath155 , giving a relative fraction ( poisson ) error of @xmath99 . by comparing the solid and dotted curves in figure 4 ,",
    "we find that a constraint on @xmath149 with @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) may be achieved",
    ". this may have the potential to discriminate between inflationary theories ( e.g. , liddle & lyth 1992 ; peiris 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , the constraint placed on the temperature ( or mass ) of dark matter particles or running of the spectral index may be still tighter , because a significant , finite dark matter temperature or a running index tends to suppress small - scale power exponentially thus amplify the effects .",
    "the high - sensitivity constraint on small - scale power is afforded by the physical fact that we are dealing with rare @xmath158 peaks in the matter distribution .",
    "third , clustering of galaxies may be computed using such a survey containing potentially hundred of thousands to millions of galaxies in a comoving volume of size @xmath159gpc@xmath152 ( for the redshift shell @xmath160 ) .",
    "both the survey volume and the number of observable galaxies within are large enough to allow for accurate determinations of the correlations of first galaxies , particularly on large scales .",
    "it may then provide an independent , perhaps ",
    "cleaner \" characterization of interesting features in the power spectrum such as the baryonic oscillations , with the advantage that they are not subject to subsequent complex physical processes , including cosmological reionization , gravitational shock heating of the igm and complex interplay between galaxies and igm , which in turn might introduce poorly understood biases in galaxy formation .",
    "a comparison between clustering of first galaxies and local galaxies ( e.g. , eisenstein 2005 ) will provide another , high - leverage means to gauge gravitational growth and other involved processes between @xmath93 to @xmath161 .",
    "finally , the scale ( @xmath119mpc comoving ) of the 21-cm absorption halo signals is much greater than the nonlinear scale and virial radius ( both @xmath119kpc comoving ) .",
    "thus , the igm region in the 21-cm absorption halo is expected to closely follow the hubble flow .",
    "since near  photons ( between  and ly@xmath129 ) are not subject to absorption by hydrogen ( and helium ) atoms whose distribution might be complex , they escape into the igm in a spherical fashion . additionally , since the dependence on @xmath71 is linear ( see equation 2 ) , density inhomogeneities are likely to average out ( to zero - th order ) and results do not depend sensitively on uncertain linear density fluctuations in the igm .",
    "although there might exist  pores \" in the domain of 21-cm absorption halo due to fluctuations in local igm temperatures which may be caused by local shock heating due to formation of minihalos , the overall effect is likely negligible , because the mass fraction contained in all halos down to a mass as small as @xmath162 is about @xmath163 at @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath164h@xmath152mpc@xmath153 the mean separation between the galaxies is @xmath118  mpc / h , much larger than the size of  scattering regions of size @xmath119mpc / h , so overlapping of the latter should be very rare ( taking into account the known fact that they are strongly clustered in the standard cosmological model with _ gaussian _",
    "random fluctuations ; mo & white 1996 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "each 21-cm absorption halo is expected to be highly spherical in real space . therefore , 21-cm absorption halos are ideal targets to apply the alcock - paczyski ( 1979 ) test .",
    "accurate measurements of angular size @xmath165 and radial depth @xmath166 for a sample of galaxies would yield a sample of @xmath167 , where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the angular diameter distance and hubble constant , respectively , both of which are , in general , functions of @xmath170 , @xmath171(@xmath172 ) and @xmath173 , with @xmath171 describing the equation of state for dark energy and @xmath173 being the curvature of the universe . as an example , let us assume that @xmath170(@xmath174 ) has been fixed exactly by independent observations and @xmath175 and that @xmath176 . then one obtains @xmath177/dw|=0.45 $ ] at @xmath93 ( huterer & turner 2001 ) .",
    "let us suppose a relative measurement error on each individual @xmath167 is @xmath178 , then with ten thousand galaxies , one could obtain a highly accurate constraint on @xmath171 with @xmath179 .",
    "likely , the accuracy of @xmath171 determined by this method may eventually be limited by the accuracy with which @xmath170 ( and @xmath173 ) can be determined by independent observations , due to the degenerate nature .",
    "we stress that this method is valid for each individual first galaxy and unaffected by uncertainties , for example , in the precise abundance of such galaxies",
    ".    in post - survey analyzes one faces the practical issue of extracting the wanted signals from the raw data , whose amplitude is expected to be dominated by foreground radio sources , including galactic synchrotron radiation , galactic and extragalactic free - free emission , and extragalactic point sources ( e.g. , di matteo , ciardi , & miniati 2004 ) . while seemingly daunting , it has already been shown that signals of the amplitude proposed here may be recovered with relatively high fidelity , when one takes into account the expected , potent differences in the spectral and angular properties between the 21-cm signal and foreground contaminants ( e.g. , zaldarriaga , furlanetto , hernquist 2004 ; santos , cooray , & knox 2005 ; wang 2005 ) .",
    "since the 21-cm absorption halos are expected to be rather regular and simple , one might be able to significantly enhance the signal by using additional techniques , such as matched filter algorithm , in combination with foreground  cleaning \" methods . finally , the amount of data in such a high spatial and frequency resolution 3-dimensional survey will be many orders of magnitude larger than that of wmap . computational challenges for analyzing it will be of paramount concern and most likely demand new and innovative approaches .",
    "it is shown that a first galaxy hosted by a halo of mass @xmath0 at @xmath1 possesses a large 21-cm absorption halo against the cmb with a brightness temperature decrement @xmath2  mk and an angular size of @xmath8 .",
    "a 21-cm tomographic survey of galaxies in the redshift shell at @xmath1 may detect millions of galaxies and may yield critical information on cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "a successful observation may need an angular resolution of @xmath180 , a spectral resolution of @xmath181khz , and a sensitivity of @xmath182  mk at @xmath5  mhz .",
    "lofar appears poised to be able to execute this unprecedented task , at least for the high end of the distribution .",
    "at least four fundamental applications may be launched with such a survey , which could potentially revolutionize cosmological study and perhaps the field of astro - particle physics .",
    "first , it may provide unprecedented constraint on star formation physics in first galaxies , for there is a proprietary sharp feature related to the threshold halo mass for efficient atomic cooling .",
    "second , it may provide a unique and sensitive probe of the small - scale power in the cosmological model hence physics of dark matter and inflation , by being able to , for example , constrain @xmath149 to an accuracy of @xmath156 at a high confidence level .",
    "constraints on the nature of dark matter particles , i.e. , mass or temperature , or running of index could be still tighter .",
    "third , clustering of galaxies that may be computed with such a survey will provide an independent set of characterizations of potentially interesting features on large scales in the power spectrum including the baryonic oscillations , which may be compared to local measurements ( eisenstein 2005 ) to shed light on gravitational growth and other involved processes from @xmath93 to @xmath161 .",
    "finally , the 21-cm absorption halos are expected to be highly spherical and trace the hubble flow faithfully , and thus are ideal systems for an application of the alcock - paczyski test . exceedingly accurate determinations of key cosmological parameters , in particular , the equation of state of the dark energy , may be finally realized . as an example , it does not seem excessively difficult to determine @xmath171 to an accuracy of @xmath183 , if @xmath170 has been determined to a high accuracy by different means .",
    "if achieved , it may have profound ramifications pertaining dark energy and fundamental particle physics ( e.g. , upadhye , ishak , & steinhardt 2005 ) .    if a null detection of the proposed signal is found , as it might turn out",
    ", implications may be as profound",
    ". it might be indicative of some heating and/or reionizing sources in the early universe ( @xmath184 ) that precede or are largely unrelated to structure formation , possibly due to yet unknown properties of dark matter particles or dark energy .",
    "alternatively , star formation and/or bh accretion in first galaxies may be markedly different from our current expectations .",
