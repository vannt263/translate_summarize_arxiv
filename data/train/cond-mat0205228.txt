    "[ phasediagram ] ) for a layered system in which superconducting order , with an order parameter denoted by @xmath7 , competes with another type of order , whose order parameter is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the two axes represent the magnetic induction , @xmath9 , and a control parameter , `` @xmath10 , '' such as pressure or doping concentration , with the convention that increasing @xmath10 disfavors @xmath8 order .",
    "it is assumed that at @xmath1 there exists a continuous quantum phase transition at @xmath11 ( the heavy circle ) separating a pure superconducting phase from a phase with coexisting @xmath8 and superconducting order .    while the considerations here are rather general , it is useful to have specific realizations in mind . for us ,",
    "the most important case is that in which @xmath8 represents  @xcite stripe orientational ( `` nematic '' ) order . in the absence of crystal field effects",
    ", the orientation of the stripes is arbitrary and can be parametrized by an angle @xmath12 . hence , in this case @xmath8 would then be a _",
    "director _ , a headless vector , which in two dimensions can be represented by a complex scalar field defined so that @xmath13 corresponds to stripes lying along a preferred direction @xmath14 .",
    "( note that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are physically equivalent . ) in this limit , @xmath8 has a continuous xy symmetry .",
    "however , in a crystal with appropriate point - group symmetry  @xcite there are only two preferred stripe orientations . in this case , @xmath8 reduces to a real scalar field reflecting the ising character of the symmetry breaking .    if , on the other hand the relevant stripe order is magnetic ( incommensurate sdw ) order , in addition to orientational symmetry the relevant broken symmetry is spin rotational invariance , so for each stripe orientation , @xmath8 is a three component real vector field corresponding to heisenberg symmetry .",
    "we shall see that this case is slightly different than the lower symmetry situations .",
    "stripe states can also spontaneously break translational symmetry , but since a vortex core explicitly breaks this symmetry in any case , issues of spatial symmetry breaking are more subtle , and will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] , the solid lines represent actual phase boundaries , and the broken lines are crossovers",
    ". the most striking feature of this phase diagram is the presence@xcite of an `` avoided critical point , '' _",
    "i.  e. _ the phase boundary @xmath17 has a discontinuity at @xmath1 : @xmath18 this discontinuity in the phase boundary is a consequence of the fact that the magnetic field is a singular perturbation .    the assumed competition ( mutual suppression ) between superconducting and @xmath8 order",
    "( the latter assumed to be essentially uncoupled to @xmath9 ) is seen in the fact that the critical line , @xmath19 separating the pure and coexistence phases is an increasing function of @xmath9 up to the point at which superconductivity is completely suppressed by a magnetic field in excess of @xmath20 .",
    "the dashed line marks a crossover from quasi one dimensional to fully three dimensional order ( where @xmath8 is more or less uniform in space ) .",
    "it essentially coincides with the phase boundary derived by demler _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite for the case in which interactions between layers are neglected@xcite .",
    "the dotted line represents a crossover associated with the mean - field phase boundary ; just to the left of this line , there is a `` halo '' of the competing order surrounding each vortex core , but each halo fluctuates essentially independently , and there is no true @xmath8 order .",
    "the arguments that lead to this phase diagram constitute the bulk of the present paper .",
    "the reader should be warned that there are some subtleties ( which we will discuss below ) associated with one or another specific type of competing order that can affect the shape , and even the topology of the phase diagram , as does even weak quenched disorder . for simplicity of discussion , for most of the paper we will assume the extreme type ii limit , in which the london penetration depth , @xmath21 , although this assumption is not necessary .",
    "some of the experimental consequences of this phase diagram are discussed in the final section of this paper .",
    "in this section , we sketch the basic physics that leads to the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "all actual derivations are deferred to later sections . for simplicity ,",
    "let us first consider the case in which the broken symmetry associated with the competing order is ising - like , _",
    "i.  e. _ @xmath8 is a real scalar , and there is a symmetry under @xmath22 .",
    "we start our discussion by considering the structure of a single , isolated vortex in the uniform superconducting state  @xcite , _",
    "i.  e. _ @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath10 is large , the structure of the vortex is unaffected by the proximity of the @xmath8 ordered phase , but if @xmath10 is sufficiently close to @xmath24 , then at mean - field level , the suppression of @xmath7 in a vortex core region of size @xmath25 ( the superconducting coherence length ) will result in a halo with radius equal to the critical correlation length , @xmath26 , in which @xmath27 .",
    "an important aspect of the structure of the vortex , first emphasized in this context by demler _ et .",
    "@xcite , is that the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter does not return to its bulk value exponentially , but rather , for a vortex at the origin and for @xmath28 , has a power - law form @xmath29 .\\ ] ] this @xmath30 fall - off is a necessary consequence of the slow decay of the superfluid flow around an isolated vortex , and results in a somewhat larger halo of @xmath8 order around a vortex than would otherwise occur . in any case , @xmath31 diverges with a critical exponent @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath32 is the quantum critical exponent of a system in @xmath34 spatial dimensions , it presumably takes its mean - field value , @xmath35 ( up to logarithmic corrections - to - scaling ) .    within a single superconducting plane",
    "the halo is a finite size system , and so can not actually support a broken symmetry state , _",
    "i.  e. _ quantum fluctuations will cause the system to tunnel between the positive and negative @xmath8 states with a matrix element @xmath36 .",
    "thus , in the absence of inter - plane couplings , there can be no true @xmath8 order established until @xmath9 is large enough , _",
    "i.  e. _ the vortex density is large enough , that there is significant coupling between neighboring vortices .",
    "because the size of the halo increases with increasing @xmath37 , we expect that @xmath38 vanishes in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "we derive an explicit expression for this , below in eq .",
    "[ eq : h ] , from the landau - ginzburg theory of competing orders .",
    "however , even if the microscopic coupling between the order parameter @xmath8 on neighboring planes , @xmath40 , is weak , the large size of the halo implies a large effective coupling , @xmath41 , between the halos on neighboring planes , with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the mean squared value of @xmath8 in the vortex halo . from the landau - ginzburg theory , this coupling is seen to diverge as @xmath44 , although only logarithmically , @xmath45 , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ moments ] ) and ( [ j ] ) .",
    "thus , along an isolated vortex , the low energy fluctuations are equivalent to an effective transverse - field ising model with ising coupling @xmath41 and transverse field @xmath38 .",
    "this model has an ordered ground - state provided @xmath46 .",
    "since as @xmath10 approaches @xmath24 , the limit @xmath47 is realized , it follows that for @xmath10 near @xmath24 , an isolated vortex line has an ordered ground - state ! moreover , in this limit , no matter how small @xmath9 , the inter - vortex coupling can never be ignored , and indeed leads to a finite transition temperature .",
    "we can estimate this transition temperature using standard methods  @xcite of quasi - one dimensional systems : we estimate the inter - vortex coupling to be @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the spacing between vortices and @xmath50 is a number of order 1 . at low temperatures",
    ", we estimate the susceptibility of an isolated vortex line to be that of the 1d ising chain , @xmath51 . finally , we estimate @xmath52 according to @xmath53 .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath54 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second expression we have adopted the landau - ginzburg estimate of @xmath41 .    reversing the present logic ,",
    "it is clear that with increasing @xmath10 , we will eventually encounter a condition in which @xmath55 .",
    "here , the ground - state of the isolated vortex line is quantum disordered , and hence even at @xmath6 , there is no @xmath8 ordering until a critical field strength , @xmath56 , is exceeded , such that the interactions between neighboring vortices is strong enough to induce ordering .",
    "the critical value @xmath57 in the limit @xmath0 marks the quantum critical point of the isolated vortex , where @xmath58 .",
    "( for small @xmath59 , the phase boundary is non - analytic@xcite - a subtlety which we have neglected in sketching fig .  [ phasediagram ] )    the remaining phase boundaries that occur at larger values of @xmath9 are determined by the obvious and conventional physics of competing orders .",
    "we now discuss the physics of the two crossover lines shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .    where the @xmath8 halos about the vortices start to overlap strongly",
    ", there is a crossover from a quasi - one dimensional regime in which the magnitude of @xmath8 is substantially inhomogeneous , to a regime where the variations of @xmath8 are relatively small .",
    "( indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] . ) at first guess might be that this crossover occurs when the spacing between vortices is of order @xmath37 or in other words when @xmath60 ( up to logarithmic corrections to scaling ) .",
    "in fact , as shown by demler _ et .",
    "@xcite , this crossover occurs at somewhat smaller @xmath9 due to the slow recovery of @xmath7 away from the vortex core .",
    "if we consider the case in which @xmath8 is homogeneous , then it is as if there were a magnetic field dependent reduction of the effective @xmath61 is proportional to the coupling strength between the two order parameters .",
    "consequently @xmath62 . ( precisely at @xmath11 , the same line of reasoning leads to the conclusion that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the dynamical scaling exponent , and hence depends on the dynamics of @xmath8 . )    for large enough @xmath65 , the competing order is sufficiently disfavored that , even at mean field level , no halo of non - zero @xmath8 is induced about the vortex core .",
    "thus , for small @xmath9 and @xmath66 , there are substantial local @xmath8 correlations along each vortex , but the quantum fluctuations are sufficiently large that the coupling between vortices can be neglected , and no true long - range @xmath8 order develops . for @xmath65 , there are no substantial @xmath8 fluctuations induced by the presence of vortices .",
    "( the value of @xmath67 at which a non - zero value of @xmath8 appears at mean - field level is computed from landau - ginzburg theory in eq .",
    "( [ alpha1 ] ) ; roughly it is the point at which @xmath68 . )",
    "we note , in passing , that even in 2d the ising case is quite different than than heisenberg case considered by demler _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "in particular , as discussed in footnote @xcite , in the ising case the transition to the coexistence phase occurs when the spacing between vortices is parametrically large compared to @xmath37 . consequently , although @xmath69 , for @xmath10 close to @xmath17 and @xmath9 small , @xmath8 is not spatially uniform but rather is strongly peaked in halos about individual vortex cores .      if @xmath8 is not an ising variable , but has higher symmetry , the above considerations are somewhat modified . in the case of an @xmath70 variable , the physics of the isolated vortex is equivalent to the well - known physics of the 1d quantum rotor model .",
    "again , there is a single site ( _ i.e. _ intra - plane ) term , which can be characterized by the energy gap , @xmath38 , between the ground - state and first excited state of a single rotor ; manifestly , @xmath38 is proportional to the inverse moment of inertia of the rotor and large @xmath38 favors a quantum disordered state .",
    "ordering , however , is again promoted by an  exchange \" interaction , @xmath41 , between neighboring `` sites , '' _",
    "i.  e. _ neighboring planes .",
    "as in the ising case , we estimate the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath10 from the landau - ginzburg treatment , below , and with the same result . for a continuous symmetry , @xmath38 does not involve tunneling , and so its dependence on @xmath10 is much weaker than in the ising case ; indeed , we will see from the landau - ginzburg treatment that @xmath38 has the inverse dependence as @xmath41 , _",
    "i.  e. _ @xmath71 .",
    "there is still a quantum disordered phase possible if @xmath72 is sufficiently large .",
    "however , at smaller @xmath72 the ordered phase of the ising chain is replaced by a conformally invariant ( power - law ) phase in the xy chain .",
    "the susceptibility in this phase is a power - law in temperature , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an increasing function of @xmath75 .",
    "so long as @xmath76 , this susceptibility still diverges as @xmath77 , so the topology of the phase diagram is similar to that in the ising case .",
    "however , now @xmath78 is determined implicitly from the relation @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , we can use the same inter - vortex mean - field theory to estimate the ordering temperature : @xmath82,\\ ] ] _",
    "i.  e. _ @xmath52 rapidly becomes immeasurably small at small @xmath9 .",
    "the classical heisenberg ferromagnet has an ordered ground state , even in one dimension .",
    "however , the @xmath83 quantum rotor model , which represents the low energy theory of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets , does not . in the absence of berry - phase terms",
    ", the one - dimensional @xmath83 chain possesses  @xcite a haldane gap , and hence a non - divergent zero temperature susceptibility .",
    "this means that the topology of the phase diagram is different for the heisenberg case , and that there is no avoided critical point .",
    "however , since the haldane gap vanishes exponentially for large @xmath75 , @xmath84 $ ] , it follows from simple scaling arguments that @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "thus , following a line of argument similar to the one which in the ising case led to eq .",
    "( [ tc - ising ] ) , inter - vortex mean field theory leads to an estimate for the critical @xmath9 , @xmath86^{-2}\\sim { |(\\alpha/\\alpha_c)-1|\\over \\log^{2}|(\\alpha/\\alpha_c)-1|},\\ ] ] where in the second expression we have adopted the landau - ginzburg estimates of @xmath38 and @xmath41 .",
    "it is also possible to imagine that a single vortex corresponds to a half - integer spin chain , in which case there is a berry s phase and consequently no haldane gap . in this case",
    ", the situation is essentially equivalent to the xy case , with the susceptibility exponent @xmath87 ( up to logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "however , it seems to us that since the effective heisenberg model in the present case is not sharply defined on the lattice scale , fluctuation effects are likely to smear out the subtle interference phenomena responsible for the special behavior of half - integer spins , leaving us with the physics of the rotor described above .",
    "there are still other subtleties to worry about . in this entire discussion",
    "we have assumed that the vortex texture of @xmath88 does not lift the symmetries which are spontaneously broken by the ordering of @xmath8 .",
    "however , where one of those broken symmetries is translation invariance , the presence of a vortex core is an explicit symmetry breaking field .",
    "if this effect is significant ( as it may well be in the case of stripe order ) , it greatly complicates the analysis .",
    "a related issue is that we have assumed that there is no frustration of global @xmath8 order which arises from the form of the vortex lattice and the nature of the coupling between neighboring halos .",
    "we believe that , in the absence of the just mentioned symmetry breaking terms , this assumption is reasonable , but it is manifestly unreasonable in their presence . finally , especially in the regime where the physics is quasi one dimensional , all results are likely to be extremely sensitive to even tiny amounts of quenched disorder . we have not fully explored the implications of any of these further problems .",
    "while most features of the problem are largely determined by considerations of order parameter symmetry , it is pedagogically useful to make them explicit by considering the landau - ginzburg treatment of two competing order parameters .",
    "we are interested in ground - state properties , so we must ultimately analyze a d+1 dimensional quantum action , where d=3 is the spatial dimension . however , we will be analyzing this action semiclassically , in the sense that we will first consider time - independent field configurations which minimize the action , and then analyze quantum fluctuations about this classical ground - state .",
    "thus , we start by considering only the classical ( static ) landau - ginzburg free energy density functional in a single plane of a layered system @xmath89 = { \\cal f}_{sc}[\\psi]+{\\cal f}_{\\phi}[{\\bf \\phi } ] + \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } \\ ; |\\psi|^2 | \\ ; { \\bf \\phi}|^2 + \\ldots \\label{calf}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , a complex scalar field , is the superconducting order parameter and @xmath8 , which may have multiple components , represents the competing order parameter . in the present paper",
    ", we will only focus on `` competing '' orders in the sense that we will always assume that @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , we assume that @xmath91 is not small - if @xmath91 is small it means that the two order parameters hardly interact , as happens , for instance , in conventional superconductors when @xmath8 and @xmath7 originate from different pieces of the fermi surface .",
    "the free energy must be invariant under a global u(1 ) transformation , @xmath92 due to gauge invariance , and , depending on the nature of the competing order , under an additional set of global transformations , @xmath93 where @xmath94 are elements of an appropriate coset space .",
    "for instance , if @xmath95 corresponds to nel order , then @xmath96 . in eq .",
    "[ calf ] , the superconducting contribution to @xmath97 is of the usual form , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the vector potential , @xmath100 is the coherence length , and here , and elsewhere , @xmath101 refers to higher order terms in powers of the order parameters .",
    "the competing order is governed by @xmath102    the mean - field solution is obtained by solving the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) equations , @xmath103 . for the most part , we will focus on states deep in the superconducting phase , where we can treat @xmath104 as a given function , leaving us with the task of computing @xmath105 . by symmetry , @xmath106 is always a solution ; where a non - trivial solution exists , it leads to a condensation energy : @xmath107 = -\\int d\\vec r \\frac { |\\bar\\phi|^4 } 4 .",

    "it is easy to see that any inhomogeneous solution of the lg equations will decay exponentially with a correlation length @xmath113 .    in the case of a single vortex at the origin",
    ", we look for a solution of the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the azimuthal angle . while the exact form of @xmath116 is somewhat complicated , at large @xmath49 it is easily seen to be @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "( of course , if magnetic screening is taken into account , @xmath118 approaches @xmath119 exponentially for @xmath120 , with the london penetration length ; in the high temperature superconductors , @xmath121 is very large , so it is reasonable to approximate it as infinite . )",

    "this equation is valid for @xmath130 ; for @xmath131 , the term @xmath132 is replaced by @xmath133 .",
    "manifestly , at large @xmath134 , @xmath135 falls with the appropriate ornstein - zernicke form , so where a non - trivial solution exists , the condensation energy is always finite .",

    ", it follows that , as @xmath142 , @xmath143 where @xmath50 and @xmath144 are numbers of order 1 .",
    "the first of these results is the essential ingredient leading to the existence of an avoided critical point in this problem .",
    "note that the long - range tails of the vortex profile contribute to , but are not essential to this result ; even if the vortex is screened , @xmath105 at the critical coupling still has a @xmath145 form , so the second moment still diverges logarithmically as the critical coupling is approached , although with a somewhat different pre - factor .    for @xmath10 not so close to @xmath24 , we expect a critical value of @xmath67 such that for @xmath65 there are no , non - trivial solutions to the lg equations in the presence of an isolated vortex .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a non - trivial solution is that the quadratic kernel in @xmath97 have at least one negative eigenvalue , _",

    "to complete the quantum description of the order parameter fluctuations in the presence of an isolated vortex - line , we define an effective euclidean action which includes inter - plane couplings and the simplest possible quantum dynamics .",
    "we will consider the dynamics only of the slow modes of the order parameter @xmath8 .",
    "however we will ignore the effects of the ( possibly interesting ) coupling to superconducting quasiparticles and other low energy degrees of freedom - at least in a bcs @xmath2-wave superconductor they have a vanishingly small density of states and their effects on the dynamics of the order parameters of interest here is likely small .",
    "in addition , since the phase mode of the superconducting order parameter @xmath7 decouples at long - wave - length from the rest of the degrees of freedom , it is reasonable to suppose that quantum fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter can be integrated out to produce a small renormalization of the effective parameters ; we thus consider only static configurations of @xmath7 , and omit any dependence on @xmath154 .",

    "i.e. _ when we consider a vortex core , we assume the vortex line is static and precisely perpendicular to the layers .",

    "in particular , wherever there is a non - trivial solution to the mean - field equations , there are clearly a family of equivalent solutions , and important fluctuations which could potentially restore the broken symmetry are those which carry the system from one solution to another .",

    "the effective hamiltonian has matrix elements , denoted below by @xmath38 , connecting these classical states with each other via tunneling processes (  spin flip \" ) .",
    "however , while a detailed calculation of these matrix elements requires additional analysis to determine the tunneling paths that locally permit the system to fluctuate from one ground - state to the other , the end result is quite simple : the resulting effective hamiltonian must be of the form of a transverse - field ising model @xmath163 where @xmath41 is given by @xmath164 in eq .",

    "now , for the case of weak inter - layer coupling and large `` mass , '' @xmath165 , we can ignore `` amplitude '' fluctuations , and focus our attention on the soft goldstone modes by restricting our attention to field configurations of the form @xmath174 so that the effective hamiltonian is @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the angular - momentum conjugate to @xmath173 , and @xmath41 is given by the same expression , eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) , as in the ising case .",

    "these results flesh out the general physical arguments made in the beginning of this paper .",
    "the effect of amplitude fluctuations have not been included in any of the present considerations - since ultimately we are dealing with a 3d quantum system , we believe they are generally less important than the `` phase '' fluctuations we have explicitly treated . we have not analyzed the further fluctuation corrections to test this supposition .",

    "the situation is likely to be even more complex , since several distinct stripe orders have been observed in materials with stripy tendencies .",

    "if this interpretation is accepted , the smaller characteristic field , which they call @xmath177 , is to be associated with the maximal core radius , @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the superconducting flux quantum . at temperatures well below the zero - field @xmath52 ,",
    "@xmath177 is typically in the range of 30 t , corresponding to @xmath180 .",
    "since this length scale is comparable to the vortex halo radius observed@xcite in stm studies of near - optimally doped , it is very tempting to associate @xmath181 with @xmath37 . in the nernst effect experiments ,",
    "@xmath177 is seen to vary roughly linearly with temperature at low temperatures , so this identification could be tested by looking for similar temperature dependence of the vortex halo radius in stm experiments .",
    "finally , we note that the picture advocated here has also a  dual \" version@xcite in which one or the other form of stripe order is dominant , and superconducting order is sub - dominant . in this case",
    ", a finite density of topological defects of the stripe state , _ dislocations _ , which could be induced by some form of shear or by disorder , plays the role of the vortex density the problem considered in the present paper .",
