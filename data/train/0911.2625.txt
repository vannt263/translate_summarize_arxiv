    "in addition to the ordinary casimir forces @xcite acting between the layers of a multilayered system , vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field cause a stress in each layer .",
    "this ( often disregarded ) effect is important when considering mechanical stability of thin layers and components@xcite and is therefore , besides being of fundamental interest@xcite , relevant in micro- and nano - technology . in our previous work @xcite ( referred to as i ) ,",
    "we have considered the stress ( referred in that work as pressure ) and its modal structure in a metal ( plasma ) slab in the center of an ideal planar cavity and demonstrated their strong dependence on the cavity width . upon emphasizing the utility of the concept of the generalized fresnel coefficients@xcite ( in conjunction with their recurrence relations@xcite ) in the theory of the casimir effect in planar cavities@xcite , in this work",
    "we discuss the dependence of the vacuum - field stress in a metal ( plasma ) layer in the symmetric lifshitz@xcite configuration on the properties of the bounding medium . to emphasize the difference between the standard casimir force per unit area and the casimir stress",
    ", we also consider the position dependence of these quantities for a metal slab in a planar cavity .",
    "consider a dielectric slab inserted in a planar cavity , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sys ] .    the vacuum - field forces ( per unit area ) acting on the slab consist of the stress @xmath0 in the slab and the net slab - mirror interaction force per unit area @xmath1 @xcite , where according to the theory of the casimir force in multilayers @xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the perpendicular wave vector at the imaginary frequency in the @xmath4th layer and @xmath5 are the reflection coefficients of the right and left stack of layers bounding the layer .",
    "@xmath6 can be conveniently expressed in terms of the fresnel coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the _ whole _ slab using the recurrence relation @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are reflection coefficients of the mirrors , and noting that @xmath12 .",
    "we find @xcite @xmath13 which agrees with the result obtained through a conventional way @xcite .    following benassi and calandra@xcite",
    ", we ignore the electostriction and magnetostrition forces in the slab . the stress in the slab",
    "is then determined solely by the minkowski stress tensor @xcite and is therefore given by eq .",
    "( [ fj ] ) , with the reflection coefficients for the waves reflected within the slab @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the reflection coefficient of the vacuum - slab interface .",
    "we first consider the stress in a metal layer sandwiched ( @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) ) between two identical ( metal ) mirrors corresponding to the symmetric lifshitz configuration . instead of",
    "a sophisticated model @xcite , we adopt here the plasma model for the layer and the drude model for mirrors @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the corresponding plasma frequencies and @xmath20 is the damping parameter of the mirrors ( in this work we use @xmath21 ) .",
    "the thickness dependence of the stress is presented on the left side of fig .",
    "[ mirr ] for several values of the ( contrast ) ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the uppermost curve practically coincides with the result obtained assuming perfect ( @xmath23 ) mirrors . in that case",
    "the stress in the layer can be calculated exactly and is , in the thin layer ( @xmath24 ) limit , given by the casimir force per unit area @xmath25@xcite , which we used to scale the stress in the figure .",
    "as seen , with decreasing reflectivity of the mirrors the stress strongly drops and acquires in this range of the layer thicknesses its nonretarded ( nr ) value @xmath26 .",
    "ultimately , when @xmath27 , we obtain the stress in a free - standing metal slab @xmath28@xcite . plotted on the right side of fig .",
    "[ mirr ] is the stress in absolute units in a gold ( @xmath29 ev @xcite ) slab for two extreme cases of the mirrors .",
    "thus , the stress in an au slab sandwiched between a couple of realistic mirrors lies in between these two curves .    as noted already by dzyaloshinski _",
    "et al_.@xcite , the stress in a thick metal ( plasma ) layer exponentially decreases .",
    "figure [ mirr ] reveals , however , that for @xmath30 it becomes gradually insensitive to the properties of the mirrors . for a thick enough layer ,",
    "it is therefore given by the result obtained for perfect mirrors@xcite @xmath31 .",
    "since the large @xmath32 behaviour of the stress is determined by small @xmath33 values of @xmath34 , we note that the same conclusion applies to layers described by a dielectric function of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 behaves regularly at the origin .",
    "this implies that addition of a salt into the liquid between the plates , as in recent experiments on screened casimir force @xcite , will cause exponential decay of the force at large liquid layer thicknesses since salt brings a plasma - like component to the dielectric function of the solution .",
    "we end this discussion by briefly considering the stress in a metal slab in a planar cavity . according to eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) , removing the mirrors from the slab ( @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) ) decreases its internal reflectivity .",
    "accordingly , with increasing slab - mirror distance , the stress in the slab behaves similarly as in fig .",
    "[ mirr ] with decreasing reflectivity of the mirrors ( cf . with fig .",
    "the position dependence of the stress in a thin slab is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cav ] .",
    "as seen on left side of this figure , the stress is largest in the center of the cavity ( where the force vanishes ) and decreases with the cavity width until it saturates to @xmath38 ( this practically occurs already at @xmath39 ) . near a mirror",
    "the stress changes sign since @xmath40 is fulfilled@xcite . on the right side of fig .",
    "[ cav ] , we compare the stress in and the force per unit area ( scaled by a factor of @xmath41 ) on the slab in the @xmath42 cavity . as discussed by benassi and calandra@xcite , these quantities become approximately of the same order when the slab - mirror distance is comparable with the slab thickness whereas at smaller slab - mirror distances the casimir force dominates .    to summarize , in this work we have demonstrated strong thickness and medium dependence of the casimir stress in a metal layer in the lifshitz configuration as well as strong dependence of the casimir stress in and force on a thin metal slab in a planar cavity on its position and cavity properties .",
