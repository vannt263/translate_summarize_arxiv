    "there are two mathematical formalisms that are widely used for yang - mills theory .",
    "one , well - known among physicists since the publication of the so - called `` wu - yang dictionary'',@xcite is the formalism of principal connections on principal bundles.@xcite on this approach , a `` gauge field '' or `` yang - mills potential '' is a principal connection on some principal bundle over a relativistic spacetime , perhaps represented , in a section - dependent way , as the pullback of a connection one - form along a local section of the bundle ; and the `` field strength '' is the curvature of this connection , again represented relative to some section of the principal bundle .",
    "the choice of a section relative to which one represents these fields on spacetime corresponds to choosing a `` gauge '' . a second approach , attractive because it appears to do away with gauge - dependent potentials , is the formalism of `` loops '' or holonomies.@xcite here one directly associates closed , piece - wise smooth curves on spacetime with elements of some group , representing features of propagation along such curves , such as the phase - shifts in interference experiments associated with those closed curves .",
    "given a principal connection on a principal bundle , one can immediately calculate the holonomies of that connection , relative to some point in the total space .",
    "conversely , a pair of classic results , due to barrett,@xcite show that there is a certain sense in which , given appropriate `` holonomy data '' on a manifold @xmath0 , there always exists a principal bundle over @xmath0 and a principal connection on that bundle such that the holonomy data arises as the holonomies of that connection , and that this bundle is , in a sense to be explained , unique .",
    "here we show that something stronger is true .",
    "given an appropriate notion of isomorphism between assignments of holonomy data , barrett s reconstruction theorem gives the action on objects of a functor realizing a categorical equivalence between a category whose objects consist in specifications of holonomy data and whose arrows are holonomy isomorphisms and a category whose objects are principal connections on principal bundles over connected manifolds and whose arrows are connection - preserving principal bundle isomorphisms .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a smooth , connected , paracompact hausdorff manifold",
    ". we will use @xmath1 to denote reparameterized composition of curves with compatible endpoints , so that given two curves @xmath2\\rightarrow m$ ] and @xmath3\\rightarrow m$ ] such that @xmath4 , we produce a curve @xmath5\\rightarrow m$ ] . ] given a curve @xmath6\\rightarrow m$ ] , meanwhile , we will take @xmath7\\rightarrow m$ ] to be the curve whose image is the same as @xmath8 s , but whose orientation is reversed .",
    "we will say that two curves @xmath9\\rightarrow m$ ] are _ thinly equivalent _ , written @xmath10 , if they agree on both endpoints and there exists a homotopy @xmath11 of @xmath12 to the null curve @xmath13\\rightarrow\\gamma_1(0)$ ] such that the image of @xmath11 is included in the image of @xmath12 .",
    "now let @xmath14 be some point of @xmath0 and denote by @xmath15 the collection of piece - wise smooth curves @xmath6\\rightarrow m$ ] satisfying @xmath16 .",
    "a _ smooth finite - dimensional family of loops _ at @xmath14 is a map @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an open subset of @xmath19 for any @xmath20 , which is smooth in the sense that the associated map @xmath21\\rightarrow m$ ] defined by @xmath22(t)$ ] is continuous and smooth on subintervals @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 for some finite @xmath25 .    with this background , we define the holonomy data mentioned above .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth manifold , let @xmath26 be a lie group , and let @xmath14 be some point in @xmath0 . then a _",
    "generalized holonomy map _ on @xmath0 with reference point @xmath14 and structure group @xmath26 is a map @xmath27 satisfying the following properties : ( 1 ) for any @xmath28 , if @xmath8 and @xmath29 are thinly equivalent , then @xmath30 ; ( 2 ) for any @xmath28 , @xmath31 ; and ( 3 ) for any smooth finite - dimensional family of loops @xmath17 , the composite map @xmath32 is smooth . for present purposes , the specification of a manifold @xmath0 and a generalized holonomy map @xmath27",
    ", for some lie group @xmath26 and point @xmath33 , constitutes a full specification of holonomy data ; we will call the pair @xmath34 a _ holonomy model _ for yang - mills theory .",
    "( note that we say nothing , here , of the dynamical relationship between @xmath35 and any distribution of charged matter . )",
    "barrett s results can then be stated as follows .",
    "fix a connected manifold @xmath0 , a lie group @xmath26 , and a point @xmath33 , and let @xmath36 be a generalized holonomy map .",
    "then there exists a principal bundle @xmath37 , a connection @xmath38 on @xmath39 , and an element @xmath40 $ ] such that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the holonomy map through @xmath43 determined by @xmath38 . determined in this way",
    "really do depend on the choice of @xmath44 , even for connected manifolds ; changing base point , even within a fiber , yields a holonomy map that is conjugate in @xmath26 to the one we began with , so if @xmath45 , then @xmath46 for any @xmath47 .",
    "in the sequel , we make precise a sense in which these are nonetheless isomorphic holonomy maps . ]",
    "the assignment of @xmath48 to generalized holonomy maps given in the above theorem is a bijection up to vertical principal bundle isomorphisms that preserve both the connection @xmath38 and the base point @xmath43 .",
    "barrett s reconstruction theorem effectively establishes that holonomy data is sufficient to reconstruct a model of yang - mills theory in the sense of a principal connection on a principal bundle ; the representation theorem , meanwhile , gives one sense in which this reconstruction is unique .",
    "but one might hope for something more regarding the uniqueness of the reconstruction .",
    "in particular , on barrett s approach , everything is done relative to fixed points @xmath33 at which the closed curves are based and @xmath49 $ ] at which the holonomies are based ; nothing is said about the relationship between holonomy models associated with different base points , even though the base points play no role in the physics of yang - mills theory .",
    "moreover , the form of barrett s results is highly suggestive : it appears that the relationship between holonomy maps and principal connections , properly construed , should be functorial .",
    "establishing this stronger result is the goal of the present paper .    in particular , we prove the following .",
    "let @xmath50 be the category ( actually , groupoid ) of principal connections on principal bundles over connected manifolds , with connection - preserving principal bundle isomorphisms as arrows , and let @xmath51 be the category ( or rather , again , groupoid ) of holonomy models ( as defined above ) on connected manifolds , with `` holonomy isomorphisms '' , to be defined in section [ sec : isomorphism ] , as arrows .",
    "[ thm : cat ] @xmath51 and @xmath50 are equivalent as categories , with an equivalence that preserves empirical content in the sense of preserving holonomy data .",
    "our proof of theorem [ thm : cat ] depends on the following result concerning the notion of holonomy isomorphism we will presently define .",
    "we take this result to be of some interest in its own right .",
    "[ thm : pbiso ] let @xmath37 and @xmath52 be principal bundles with principal connections @xmath38 and @xmath53 respectively , and suppose that @xmath0 and @xmath54 are connected .",
    "suppose there are points @xmath44 and @xmath55 such that the holonomy maps based at @xmath43 and @xmath56 are isomorphic .",
    "then there is a connection - preserving principal bundle isomorphism between @xmath39 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that the choice of a category of holonomy maps is not entirely straightforward , as there are several candidate notions for arrows between holonomy models .",
    "below we will identify two possible categories@xmath51 , relative to which the theorem is stated , and @xmath58differing in their arrows , and show that they are related by a quotient functor that does not split .",
    "for present purposes , we are agnostic as to which category is the `` right '' one , but find it expedient to prove our main theorem with @xmath51 , and then infer the analogue result for @xmath58 as an immediate corollary .",
    "we believe these results , taken together , substantially clarify the role of base points in barrett s construction , by showing ( 1 ) how various changes of base point may be understood to induce an isomorphism of holonomy data and ( 2 ) that holonomy models related by holonomy isomorphisms in this sense correspond to isomorphic principal connections .",
    "as we will discuss in the final section , theorem [ thm : cat ] also provides one sense in which there is no `` loss of structure '' involved in moving from the principal bundle formalism to the loop formalism ( or vice - versa ) , despite claims by some that the latter is more parsimonious.@xcite    in the next section , we will discuss the possible choices of a category of holonomy maps and define the notion of holonomy isomorphism needed for theorems [ thm : pbiso ] and [ thm : cat ] .",
    "in the following two sections , we will prove theorems [ thm : pbiso ] and [ thm : cat ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the interpretation of the results here , especially in connection with the baez - dolan - bartels classification of forgetful functors , and a remark about how this work relates to recent results of @xcite .",
    "consider a connected manifold @xmath0 , a lie group @xmath26 , and a generalized holonomy map @xmath27 for some point @xmath33 , in the sense defined above .",
    "we are interested in developing a precise sense in which two such maps might be `` isomorphic '' , in the sense of encoding the same physically relevant structure  i.e . , the same `` holonomy data '' . to this end , we take the physically relevant structure of a generalized holonomy map to consist in the group theoretic structure of the assignments of elements of @xmath26 to piece - wise smooth closed curves in @xmath0 . this suggests that there are several ways in which two generalized holonomy maps might be understood to encode the same structure . for one ,",
    "consider diffeomorphic manifolds @xmath0 and @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath59 is a diffeomorphism , we can understand the generalized holonomy map @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 to encode the same holonomy data as @xmath35 .",
    "so we should take @xmath27 and @xmath62 to be isomorphic if they are related by a diffeomorphism in this way .",
    "likewise , if @xmath63 is a lie group isomorphism , the generalized holonomy map @xmath64 may be understood to encode the same holonomy data as @xmath35 , so we should take @xmath27 and @xmath65 to be isomorphic if they are related by a lie group isomorphism in this way .    there is a third sense in which two generalized holonomy maps may be understood to encode the same holonomy data , though it is somewhat more subtle to state .",
    "the idea is that , as noted above , although a generalized holonomy map is defined relative to some base point @xmath33 , this base point plays no role in the physics .",
    "thus , we would like to understand generalized holonomy maps associated with different base points to encode the same data .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "let @xmath66 be as above and consider another point @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a piece - wise smooth curve in @xmath0 from @xmath69 to @xmath14 .",
    "for all @xmath70 , define @xmath71 . to extend @xmath72 to all of @xmath73 , recall that thinly equivalent curves must have the same holonomies .",
    "thus for any @xmath74 , since @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "there is thus a natural sense in which , relative to @xmath68 , @xmath35 and @xmath72 may be understood to encode the same holonomy data . in other words ,",
    "given generalized holonomy maps @xmath27 and @xmath77 , we should take @xmath35 and @xmath78 to be isomorphic if there exists some piece - wise smooth curve @xmath79\\rightarrow m$ ] , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 .    in connection with first two senses of isomorphism between generalized holonomy maps ,",
    "it is natural to associate the induced holonomy isomorphism with a given choice of diffeomorphism or lie group isomorphism . in the third case ,",
    "it is tempting to do likewise : that is , to associate a map with the curve @xmath68 relating the generalized holonomy maps .",
    "we might then define a map begin holonomy maps @xmath27 to @xmath83 on manifolds @xmath0 and @xmath54 as an ordered triple @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a diffeomorphism , @xmath86 is a lie group isomorphism , and @xmath87 \\to m$ ] is a piece - wise smooth curve satisfying @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and @xmath70 , @xmath90 .",
    "but there are several reasons why this definition would be unsatisfactory .",
    "the first is simple : we are looking for a notion of `` holonomy isomorphism '' , and maps defined as just described would not be isomorphisms , since they are generally not invertible .",
    "the second problem is closely related .",
    "recall that thinly equivalent curves always have the same holonomies , and hence transformations of holonomy maps by thinly equivalent curves do not induce meaningfully different holonomy transformations .",
    "thus one might prefer , rather than indexing holonomy isomorphisms by curves , to use thin - equivalence classes of curves .",
    "this modification leads to what we will call _ _ holonomy isomorphism__@xmath91s , which are equivalent classes of maps as just described whose curves @xmath68 are all thinly equivalent  i.e .",

    "we also can define the composition of holonomy isomorphisms @xmath92_{\\sim } , \\phi ) : h \\rightarrow h'$ ] and @xmath96_{\\sim } , \\phi ' ) : h ' \\rightarrow h''$ ] , by @xmath96_{\\sim } , \\phi ' ) \\circ ( \\psi , [ \\alpha]_{\\sim } , \\phi ) : = ( \\psi ' \\circ \\psi , [ \\alpha \\bullet ( \\psi^{-1}\\circ\\alpha')]_{\\sim } , \\phi ' \\circ \\phi)$ ] , where @xmath97_{\\sim}$ ] is the equivalence class of curves generated by @xmath98 for _ any _ curves @xmath99_{\\sim}$ ] and @xmath100_{\\sim}$ ] .",
    "we can thus define a category @xmath58 of holonomy maps and holonomy isomorphism@xmath91s . as we show in prop .",
    "[ groupoid ] below , holonomy isomorphism@xmath91s are isomorphisms ( and thus @xmath58 is a groupoid ) , and so we have also solved the first problem mentioned above .",
    "arguably , however , holonomy isomorphism@xmath91s still do not give us what we want .",
    "the reason is that , given two generalized holonomy maps @xmath27 and @xmath77 , there may exist distinct curves @xmath101\\rightarrow m$ ] , both satisfying @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and both such that @xmath104 . to count these as distinct isomorphisms would be to assert that there is a substantive ( or at least , salient ) difference in the way @xmath68 and @xmath105 take @xmath35 to @xmath78 .",
    "but since the physics depends only on the assignments of group elements to closed curves , if @xmath68 and @xmath105 both provide the same `` translation '' from the assignments made by @xmath35 to the assignments made by @xmath78 , then nothing in the physics turns on which translation one picks , and this should be reflected in how we differentiate isomorphisms ",
    ", we should not make a distinction if there is no salient difference .",
    "we address this issue by saying that curves @xmath101\\rightarrow m$ ] are equivalent ( relative to @xmath35 and @xmath78 ) if @xmath104 .",
    "the considerations just described are summed up in the following definition of holonomy isomorphism .",

    ", we can immediately define notions of identity map , composition , and inverse for holonomy isomorphisms , and thus define a category @xmath51 of holonomy maps and holonomy models . as with holonomy isomorphism@xmath91s",

    "[ groupoid ] @xmath51 and @xmath58 are groupoids .",
    "the arguments in both cases are identical , and so we will consider just @xmath51 .",

    "associativity is a trivial consequence of the associativity of composition of the maps determining a holonomy isomorphism . to see that every arrow has an inverse , consider a holonomy isomorphism @xmath112 , where @xmath27 and @xmath113 .",

    "we have now proved the main results of the paper . in particular , theorem",
    "[ thm : cat ] establishes that on at least one construal of the category of holonomy models , @xmath51 and @xmath50 are equivalent .",
    "this captures one sense in which one might think that no structure is lost in moving between principal bundle and loop formulations of yang - mills theory ; one might also take it to capture a sense in which these formalisms are equivalent , by virtue of having the capacity to represent just the same physics .",
    "we conclude with two comments .",
    "the first is to note a relationship to the @xcite result of @xcite , who showed that category we call @xmath50 is equivalent to a category @xmath418 of parallel transport maps and suitably defined arrows .",
    "it follows that @xmath51 is also equivalent to @xmath418 , and that @xmath58 is not equivalent to any of these other categories , at least in a physically interesting way .",
    "thus the results presented might thus be seen provide a broader picture of the categorical relationships between three important ways of characterizing models of yang - mills theory .",
    "the situation is summarized in the following figure [ fig1 ] .     of principal bundles with principal connections , the category @xmath418 of parallel transport maps , and two possible choices of categories of holonomy maps .",
    "double arrows denote categorical equivalence , while single arrows denote the existence of a quotient functor that does not split . ]    the second comment concerns how to understand the relationships just sketched in terms of the baez - dolan - bartels classification for forgetful functors . of course , the functors realizing equivalences forget nothing , and so there is an important sense in which @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath418 all encode precisely the same information  i.e .",
    ", they can be related by functors that forget nothing .",
    "as we have noted , however , the functor @xmath419 is not essentially invertible : it is full and surjective , but not faithful .",
    "thus it forgets ( only ) `` stuff '' .",
    "( what stuff ? it is not clear that a clean answer is available , but our intuition is that we are forgetting unnecessary information about the base point . ) likewise , if @xmath420 is the functor that realizes the equivalence in theorem [ thm : cat ] , then @xmath421 also forgets only stuff .",
    "it is in this context that prop .",
    "[ split ] becomes particularly interesting .",
    "there we show that @xmath120 does not split .",
    "if it _ did _ split , then there would be a functor @xmath422 that would be faithful and essentially surjective , but not full ",
    ", it would forget ( only ) `` structure '' .",
    "it would follow that there would be a functor @xmath423 that also forgot only structure .",
    "one might then argue that there is a sense in which the holonomy formalism has less structure than the principal bundle formalism , provided one could argue that @xmath424 is otherwise preferable to @xmath51 .",
    "it is this argument that is blocked by prop .",
    "[ split ] , removing the worry that choosing @xmath51 over @xmath424 somehow `` adds '' structure ( in the baez - dolan - bartel sense ) in a way the undermines the significance of theorem [ thm : cat ] . in other words , if we chose to work with @xmath424 instead of @xmath51 , it would seem that the holonomy formalism would have more `` stuff '' than the principal bundle formalism , and no less structure .",
    "this helps clarify what is at stake in choosing between @xmath51 and @xmath424 ; it also gives some reason to doubt that either choice of category will help someone who believes the holonomy formalism is somehow more parsimonious .",
    "that said , there is some sense in which these final considerations are beside the point .",
    "one might have thought that the question of real interest was whether or not the principal bundle formalism allows us to describe physical situations that , by the lights of that theory , properly construed , are somehow physically inequivalent  say because they require us to make a choice between different , inequivalent bundle structures  but which nonetheless correspond to the same holonomy data .",
    "one might then think that the principal bundle formalism has some sort of `` excess structure '' , such that we would need to posit a new form of isomorphism between principal bundles with connections , analogous to the gauge transformations one introduces in classical electromagnetism , to remove that structure .",
    "but if that were the worry , then theorem [ thm : pbiso ] substantially settles the issue , since it establishes that given an equivalence class of holonomy models , in the sense of @xmath51 _ or _",
    "@xmath425 , then there is a unique principal bundle and principal connection with the appropriate structure group that gives rise to those holonomy models .",
