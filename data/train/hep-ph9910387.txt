    "the available solar neutrino data from the homestake ( cl ) @xcite , gallex ( ga ) @xcite , sage ( ga ) @xcite , kamiokande ( k ) @xcite , and super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite experiments indicate consistently a significant @xmath4 flux deficit @xcite with respect to the predictions of the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism of neutrino oscillations in matter @xcite represents a possible explanation of this deficit .",
    "recent global analyses of the data within the msw mechanism for active @xmath5 oscillations @xcite currently select three separate regions in the parameter space @xmath6 , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "data , updated as of summer  99 conferences .",
    "the details are not relevant for the present work and are discussed elsewhere @xcite . ]",
    "the three allowed regions are usually indicated @xcite as `` small mixing angle '' ( sma ) , `` large mixing angle '' ( lma ) , and `` low @xmath1 '' ( low ) solutions .",
    "the precise shape of the allowed regions in fig .",
    "1 is subject to changes due to fluctuations in the data , improvements in the ssm fluxes , and details of the statistical analysis . in particular , the low solution , which tends to overestimate the cl rate and",
    "to underestimate the ga rate , is a `` borderline '' case : it may be allowed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or excluded ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) at 99% c.l .",
    ", as a consequence of relatively small variations in the data or in the theoretical predictions and their uncertainties .",
    "notice that the recent _ spectral _ data from sk @xcite do not show clear deviations from standard expectations , and are compatible with the low solution , which predicts small or null distortions of the sk time - energy distributions of events ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "57 of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath7 ) .",
    "clearly , the status of the low solution ( as well as of the sma and lma solutions ) can be firmly assessed only through more precise or new experimental data . since the msw physics scales as @xmath8 ,",
    "the low-@xmath1 region is more properly tested through observations of the low - energy part of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "in particular , within the low solution the earth regeneration effects @xcite are rather large for be and _ pp _ solar @xmath4 s ( see , e.g. , @xcite and fig .  9 of @xcite ) .",
    "such effects can be revealed as time variations of event rates in two , new - generation solar neutrino experiments at gran sasso : borexino @xcite ( based on @xmath9-@xmath10 scattering ) and the gallium neutrino observatory ( gno ) @xcite ( based on @xmath4-ga absorption ) .",
    "however , while the real - time experiment borexino can observe _ day - night _ rate variations , the radiochemical gno experiment can detect only long - term , _ seasonal _ variations related to the longer neutrino pathlength in the earth during winter .    in this work ,",
    "we first revisit ( sec .",
    "ii ) the calculation of the night - day asymmetry expected in borexino .",
    "then we present ( sec .",
    "iii ) a detailed calculation of the winter - summer rate difference @xmath11 ( six months averages ) in gno , with eccentricity effects removed .",
    "we show that , within the low solution , one expects @xmath126 snu , with a dominant contribution from _ pp _ neutrinos .",
    "we conclude our work in sec .",
    "iv , and give in the appendix analytical formulae useful for winter and summer averages at the gran sasso site .",
    "figure  2 shows our calculation of the event rates ( normalized to ssm unoscillated values ) in borexino during daytime ( d ) and nighttime ( n ) , averaged over the year .",
    "the scales are the same as in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , we adopt @xmath13 as abscissa , rather than the usual variable @xmath14 , in order to expand the plot in the region at large mixing , interesting for the low solution .",
    "the calculation includes updated neutrino fluxes , spectra , and production regions in the sun @xcite , radiatively corrected differential cross sections @xcite for @xmath4 and for the oscillating partners @xmath15 , and borexino detector technical specifications as in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 survival probability is calculated taking into account an accurate earth density profile @xcite , and is then averaged over nighttime as described in @xcite .",
    "each panel of fig .",
    "2 is sampled through a @xmath16 grid .    the comparison of the yearly - averaged nighttime and daytime rates in fig .",
    "2 shows that day - night variations larger than 1% are expected in borexino over three decades in @xmath1 ( @xmath17@xmath18 ev@xmath3 ) , as a consequence of ( mainly be ) neutrino regeneration in the earth .",
    "the maximum night - day asymmetry can be as large as @xmath19 at @xmath20 ( similar results have been obtained in @xcite ) .",
    "however , within the low solution of fig .  1 , the values expected for the asymmetry are smaller ( @xmath2120% ) .",
    "although a 10% asymmetry seems to be sufficiently large for a clear detection in borexino @xcite , this fact indicates that the be neutrino energy is somewhat too high to test the low region with full - strength earth regeneration effects .",
    "therefore , the logical next step is to investigate the earth regeneration effect in experiments sensitive to the lowest - energy ( _ pp _ ) neutrinos , namely , gallium absorption experiments .",
    "when the first solar neutrino results from gallex and sage became available , the authors of @xcite pointed out that large _ day - night _ variations should be expected in such experiments within the low solution ( which they called `` region c '' ) . however , such daily variations of the ga event rate @xcite are practically unobservable , being averaged out in each experimental run .",
    "absorption on yb and gd targets , as in the low energy neutrino spectroscopy ( lens ) project @xcite . other projects ( heron , hellaz ) focus on @xmath9-@xmath10 scattering in helium @xcite .",
    "such proposals are not investigated in this work . ] similarly , day - night effects for b and be neutrinos are effectively smeared out in the homestake ( cl ) experiment @xcite , since early proposals of separate day - night extractions @xcite have never been realized .",
    "nevertheless , it was noted in several 1986 - 87 papers that `` ... a day - night difference , if it is sufficiently large , should reveal itself also in a summer - winter difference '' @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the limited statistics of the first - generation ga and cl experiment , the possibility of observing msw - induced seasonal variations in radiochemical experiments was not ( to our knowledge ) further investigated .    here",
    "we fill this gap by showing that such possibility might become realistic in the second - generation , high - statistics gno experiment at gran sasso , which should significantly improve the already excellent performance of its parent experiment gallex .",
    "in fact , we estimate that msw - induced _ seasonal _ variations in the range @xmath22 snu are expected in a ga experiment ( within the low solution ) .",
    "such variations , which are below the gallex and sage detection sensitivities @xcite , might well be observed at gno , where the prospective statistical error after one solar cycle amounts to @xmath23 snu @xcite .",
    "indeed , the observation of the purely geometrical ( @xmath24 ) seasonal variations due to the earth orbit eccentricity represents one of the possible goals in gno @xcite .",
    "being interested only in the nontrivial seasonal variations , we remove eccentricity effects and focus on the net effects due to @xmath4 regeneration in the earth ( see the appendix for further details ) .",
    "we conventionally divide the year in two six - months periods ( indicated as `` winter '' and `` summer '' ) centered at the solstice days and separated by the equinox days : @xmath25\\ , \\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm summer } & \\equiv & { \\rm summer\\ solstice\\ ( 21\\ jun.)}\\;\\pm 3{\\rm\\ months } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & [ { \\rm 22\\ march,~22\\ september}]\\ .\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the neutrino oscillation probabilities and event rates are then averaged over such periods through a `` weight function '' approach similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "figure  3 shows the results of our calculation of the gallium absorption rates ( in snu ) averaged over winter @xmath26 , summer @xmath27 , and year @xmath28 , together with the main new result of this work , the winter - summer difference @xmath11 .",
    "since eccentricity effects are removed , the difference @xmath11 approaches zero in the limits of no oscillations ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) and of energy - averaged oscillations ( large @xmath1 ) , up to small round - off errors ( see below ) .",
    "the comparison of the two upper panels ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) shows that , in the region of the low solution ( @xmath33 ) , large earth regeneration effects distort the iso - snu gallium curves both in winter and in summer ; indeed , the corresponding distortion in the @xmath34 panel is partly responsible for the appearance of the low solution in fits to the data .",
    "notice that , in the region of the low solution , the yearly - averaged theoretical rate is @xmath35 snu , which is consistent with the sage results ( @xmath36 snu @xcite ) , but somewhat underestimates the gallex rate ( @xmath37 snu @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the first check of the low solution in gno will come from a more precise measurement of the total rate averaged over the year .    in the fourth panel of fig .  3",
    ", the difference @xmath11 shows a rather complicated structure as a function of the mass - mixing parameters , with several peaks and valleys .",
    "the values of @xmath11 are almost everywhere positive , since earth matter effects are typically less pronounced in summer than in winter , when the neutrino trajectories probe the inner part of the earth and can cross its core , as shown in the appendix .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath11 is @xmath38 snu .",
    "however , small negative values ( @xmath39 snu at minimum ) can be reached around @xmath40 , inside the `` boomerang - shaped '' region labeled by zero .",
    "smaller negative values ( tenths of a snu ) can also be reached around @xmath41 .",
    "the outermost curve , labeled @xmath42 snu , crosses a region at very low gradient , and is thus numerically unstable : very small changes ( percents of a snu ) can shift it significantly .",
    "all the other isolines are stable , being located in high - gradient regions .",
    "since we estimate a numerical accuracy of about @xmath43 snu in our total rates , the @xmath42 snu curve simply indicates a zone with negligibly small winter - summer difference .",
    "this zone covers the sma and lma regions of fig .",
    "1 . negative or zero values for the winter - summer difference are instead irrelevant for the low solution region , where the difference @xmath11 is positive and greater than about 4 snu , with a local maximum of 6.3 snu .",
    "therefore , if the low solution is the explanation of the solar neutrino problem , one should observe in gno a net winter - summer difference ( in excess of the trivial eccentricity difference ) of about 4 to 6 snu .",
    "no significant difference should be observed in the case of the sma or lma solutions .    in order to understand better the structure of the @xmath11 isolines ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the separate contributions to this difference coming from the _ pp _ , be , _ pep_+cno , and b solar neutrino fluxes . ''",
    "cross ( as in fig .",
    "3 ) regions at very low gradient , where the values of @xmath11 is either zero or of the order of the numerical accuracy ( @xmath43 snu ) . ] the leading contribution to the winter - summer difference in the low region appears to be given by _",
    "neutrinos , with a subleading contribution from be neutrinos , and negligible contributions from other sources .",
    "the @xmath44 value at the maximum of each plot roughly scales as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the average neutrino energy ; therefore , the sum of the various contributions produces separates peaks in the total value of @xmath11 , as already noted in fig .  3 .",
    "figure  4 demonstrates that the winter - summer asymmetry in gno is mainly sensitive to _ pp _ neutrinos , thus providing a test of the low solution intrinsically different from the borexino night - day asymmetry , which is dominated by be neutrinos .",
    "the two tests are also complementary in tracking the origin of the time variations : a possible seasonal signal in gno , if originated by vacuum ( instead of msw ) oscillations , should not produce a @xmath47 asymmetry in borexino .",
    "it is curious to notice that the latitude dependence of the seasonal variations is different from the case of day - night variations , which could be enhanced in an equatorial experiment @xcite .",
    "in fact , the difference @xmath11 vanishes at the equator , while it becomes equal to the night - day rate difference at the poles , where nighttime coincides with winter .",
    "a final remark about uncertainties is in order .",
    "the `` theoretical '' error in @xmath11 at gno , due to systematic uncertainties of the ssm , is very small .",
    "in fact , for a typical expected signal @xmath48 , the @xmath49 ssm errors @xcite amount to @xmath50 snu and @xmath51 snu for the _ pp _ and be flux components , respectively .",
    "moreover , since the _ pp _ and be flux errors are strongly anticorrelated @xcite , the two error components tend to cancel , giving a total theoretical uncertainty as small as @xmath52 snu . concerning the experimental errors , they can only be guessed at present .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of @xmath11 , given the prospective estimates of @xcite , should be @xmath23 snu after about one solar cycle .",
    "the systematics might be dangerously larger @xcite ; however , their constant components are expected to cancel , to a large extent , in a rate difference such as @xmath11 .",
    "a dedicated monte  carlo simulation would be very helpful to estimate the total errors , and thus the statistical significance , of the @xmath11 measurement at gno .",
    "we have shown that the so - called `` low '' msw solution to the solar neutrino problem can be tested through earth regeneration effects in two complementary ways : day - night variations in borexino and seasonal variations in gno .",
    "the first are dominated by be neutrinos , and the second by _ pp _ neutrinos .",
    "the net winter - summer difference of event rates in gno ( removing eccentricity effects ) amounts to about 46 snu within the low solution , and it might be detected in gno after @xmath53 years of data taking , assuming the progressive error reduction estimated in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have focussed on six - months averaged gno rates , in order to compute the seasonal effect corresponding to the largest statistics .",
    "of course , the effect could be larger in selected ( shorter ) intervals of time , but the corresponding statistics would also be lower",
    ". it might be useful to investigate optimal periods for time averaging ( maximizing the signal - to - error ratio ) , when the prospective gno statistical and systematic uncertainties will be quantified more precisely .",
    "one of us ( d.m . ) thanks z.  berezhiani and the organizers of the gran sasso summer institute `` massive neutrino in physics and astrophysics , '' where part of this work was done , for kind hospitality .",
    "in this section we discuss our calculation of the average survival probability @xmath54 for a @xmath4 crossing the sun ( s ) and the earth ( e ) , during winter and summer time .",
    "the method is similar to the one used for yearly averaging in ref .",

    "`` winter '' ( w ) is then defined as a period of @xmath59 months @xmath60 centered at @xmath58 , and `` summer '' ( s ) as the complementary period of the year ( see also sec .",

    "gets @xmath70 .",
    "the fraction of nighttime during summer is , of course , @xmath71 .    in order to calculate the average sun - earth survival probability @xmath72 over the winter period ,",
    "it is useful to split such period into nighttime ( n ) and daytime ( d ) . during daytime ,",
    "the earth correction is absent , and only the survival probability in the sun ( @xmath73 ) is relevant : @xmath74 similarly , for summer averages one has : @xmath75 so that the task is reduced to the calculation of the winter and summer averages during nighttime , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , we transform the integrations over winter and summer nighttime in integrations over the nadir angle @xmath78 $ ] through appropriate weight functions @xmath79 and",
    "@xmath80 : @xmath81 the weight functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 simply represent the solar exposure as a function of the nadir angle , namely , they are proportional to the total fraction of time spent by the sun as it repeatedly crosses ( from a `` ptolemaic '' viewpoint ) a given nadir angle during winter and summer nighttime , respectively .    in order to show the net seasonal effect due to msw regeneration in the earth , we remove eccentricity effects by calculating the weight functions for a `` circular '' earth orbit .",
    "of course , this implies that the eccentricity ( @xmath24 ) effects shall be appropriately removed also from the experimental rates .",
    "notice that the data must be corrected in any case for time - variation studies , in order to account for blank runs , different durations of runs , and for runs crossing the winter - summer separation days ( equinoxes ) . for a circular earth orbit ,",
    "it turns out that the weight functions can be generally expressed @xcite in terms of complete and incomplete elliptic integrals of the first kind , @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite : in the weight functions , and compare with the raw data . in this approach @xcite ( not adopted in this work ) , there would be a residual ( geometrical ) winter - summer asymmetry in the absence of neutrino oscillations , and the weight functions @xmath84 should be corrected by an additional term @xmath85 containing elliptic integrals of the third kind ; see appendix  d of @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath86 such integrals can be calculated numerically , e.g. , through the routines in @xcite .",
    "we give only the final results for the winter and summer weight functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 at the gran sasso latitude , the derivation being analogous to the case of the annual weight function @xmath84 in @xcite : @xmath87 @xmath88 in the above equations , the arguments of the functions are defined as follows : @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96    the weight functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 , defined in eqs .",

    "notice that the earth core is crossed only during winter time , and that trajectories are generally weighted in different ways during winter and summer .",
    "this difference implies that the winter - summer asymmetry does not simply depend on different fractions of nighttime in winter @xmath100 and summer @xmath101 , as derived in @xcite in first approximation , and explains why , in general , the day - night and winter - summer asymmetries are not strictly proportional to each other @xcite .",
