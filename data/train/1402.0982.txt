    "modelling porous media is a challenge , in particular because geometry of such materials can be extremely complex .",
    "rock samples are often described as a pile of layers of solid phase which do not permit flows , creating voids in - between layers that are connected by channels , the size and shape of which is difficult to describe ( and to observe experimentally , although , in rare cases , imaging methods such as micro - tomography can be used ) . besides these issues",
    "related to the description of the geometry of the media , another difficulty is to properly model the physical phenomena occuring in the flow . to circumvent these difficulties ,",
    "a possible approach consists in completely forgetting the exact geometry of the system except for a few parameters ( e.g. the size of the channels ) , and consider that the channels form a simple network , often taken to be @xmath0 .",
    "this results in the so - called pore - network models ( pnm ) , initially introduced by fatt in the 1950s  @xcite and which have been widely used since then .",
    "the void space of a rock ( its porosity ) is described by a pore network connected by channels . in this framework",
    ", the geometry of pores and channels is idealized .",
    "some microscopic properties are assigned to network elements ( e.g. the conductance of the channels ) and rules are defined to compute the upscaled ( homogenized ) properties on the basis of this microscopic description . in turn , these upscaled properties can be compared to the available experimental data .",
    "the aim is to construct a microscopic network with the same effective properties as those of a real representative sample of rock .    in this work ,",
    "we follow this approach , and assume that pores are located at the vertices of a simple lattice .",
    "we adopt a stochastic model , and assume that , at the microscopic scale , physical properties are described by some random field . in particular , we focus on monophasic transport phenomena in porous media , where the sample of rock is mainly characterized by its permeability .",
    "these phenomena are described by the darcy s law , where the local flux of water is assumed to be proportional to the local pressure gradient , and the microscopic properties of interest are the conductances of the channels . in the pore network model ,",
    "conductances are solely assigned to channels , and it is assumed that pores do not contribute to the flow . following darcy s equation ,",
    "the microscopic pressure field is computed in the network by ensuring mass conservation at each pore .",
    "the equation to solve is therefore a _ discrete _ linear elliptic equation in divergence form , with random coefficients ( see   below ) .",
    "the conductances of the channels ( i.e. their microscopic permeabilities ) depend on their size .",
    "therefore the construction of the network starts by randomly attributing a size to each channel . in practice",
    ", this channel size distribution can be inferred from experiments such as mercury porosimetry : we denote it by @xmath1 .",
    "several issues of different nature arise in this procedure . as a consequence",
    ", it turns out that the effective properties ( e.g. macroscopic permeability ) that are computed for a pore network with channel sizes distributed according to @xmath1 are different from the experimental effective properties . the extraction procedure , which provides a channel size distribution , is thus somewhat slightly inconsistent .",
    "the main goal of this work consists in improving that distribution , when starting from the experimental initial guess , in order to eventually achieve a better agreement between measured and computed effective properties .    from a more mathematical standpoint",
    ", the question can be phrased in the following terms .",
    "consider a second - order divergence - form operator whose coefficients are random .",
    "if the distribution of the coefficients is stationary and ergodic , then ( under some additional technical assumptions ) this random operator can be replaced , over large scales , by an effective operator with constant homogenized coefficients .",
    "random homogenization theory actually provides formulas to compute the homogenized quantities .",
    "we have thus at our disposal a procedure to compute macroscopic quantities if we know the microscopic quantities , and to solve the so - called _",
    "forward problem_. however , in practice , given a heterogeneous materials , it is a difficult question to decide on the law of the microscopic physical properties . on the other hand ,",
    "macroscopic quantities are more easily accessible .",
    "it is thus of interest to consider the _ inverse problem _ , and try to extract some information on the properties of the materials at the microscopic scale on the basis of macroscopic quantities .    in the same spirit , if one makes assumptions on the microscopic law , then macroscopic quantities can be computed , and for instance compared to experimental values . in view of the possible discrepancy between the two , one could question or revisit the assumptions made at the microscopic scale .",
    "of course , homogenization is an averaging process , which filters out many features of the microscopic coefficients .",
    "there is thus no hope to recover a full information about the microstructure ( in our case , the _ probability distribution _ of the conductances ) from the only knowledge of macroscopic quantities .",
    "we adopt here a more restricted objective .",
    "we will assume a functional form for the distribution of the microscopic conductances ( namely , a weibull distribution ) .",
    "our aim is to recover the _ parameters _ ( denoted here @xmath2 ) of that microscopic law of the basis of macroscopic quantities .",
    "we point out that our approach is not specific to weibull laws , and that it could be used for other distribution laws with parameters @xmath2 .",
    "what we need is that the random field @xmath3 used at the microscopic scale can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a field of random variables that are uniformly distributed and @xmath6 smoothly depends on the parameters @xmath2 ( see   in our particular case ) . computing the derivatives of the microscopic random field @xmath3 ( and next of the macroscopic , homogenized quantities ) with respect to @xmath2 is then easy .",
    "our motivation for choosing weibull laws comes from physical reasons : based on experimental results , it appears to be a reasonable choice .",
    "likewise , our approach is not specific to _ discrete _ elliptic equations .",
    "it could be also applied for problems modelled with _ continuous _",
    "elliptic partial differential equations ( pdes ) with random , highly oscillatory coefficients . here",
    ", we consider discrete equations because the pore network model , which is naturally written in terms of discrete equations , is commonly used for such materials .",
    "the question of recovering the unknown parameters @xmath2 of the microscopic distribution from homogenized ( and more generally macroscopic ) quantities belongs to the wide family of _ inverse problems_. in this work , a major point of interest is the selection of the macroscopic quantities which we need to know in order to uniquely determine the parameters @xmath2 .",
    "this point is discussed in section  [ sec : discut ] .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : definition ] , we recall some elements of stochastic homogenization and describe the physical problem that motivates this work ( including the choice of weibull laws ) . we conclude that section with results specific to the one - dimensional case . in particular , random variables distributed according to a weibull law are not isolated from 0 or @xmath7 , and thus the microstructure does not satisfy the classical assumption of ellipticity , namely   below .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : oned ] that , in the one - dimensional case , homogenization still holds under a weaker assumption , that in turn is satisfied by weibull random variables .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : inverse ] , we introduce our parameter fitting problem , formulated as a least - square optimization .",
    "we first consider the general ( multi - dimensional ) case before turning to the one - dimensional case . in that latter case , we discuss the macroscopic quantities that are needed to uniquely determine the parameters @xmath2 . more precisely , weibull laws have two parameters , and the knowledge of a single homogenized quantity ( namely the macroscopic permeability ) is , as expected , insufficient to determine the two unknown parameters .",
    "we show there ( in the one - dimensional case ) that , if we additionally specify the relative variance of the effective macroscopic permeability , then we are in position to uniquely determine the two parameters of the microscopic weibull law .",
    "section  [ sec : numerics ] is dedicated to numerical results , again in the one - dimensional case .",
    "we show that the newton algorithm can be efficiently used in the current least - square optimization setting . in particular , in practice ,",
    "the exact homogenized coefficients can not be computed , and only a random approximation of them is available .",
    "we monitor here how this randomness propagates to the optimal parameters .",
    "the detailed extension of the strategy to the two - dimensional case , along with corresponding numerical tests , will be addressed in a future work  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we recall first , in sections  [ subsec : homog ] and  [ sec : truncated ] , some elements of homogenization for discrete elliptic equations with random coefficients .",

    "<S> in porous media physics , calibrating model parameters through experiments is a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> this process is plagued with errors that come from modelling , measurement and computation of the macroscopic observables through random homogenization  the forward problem  as well as errors coming from the parameters fitting procedure  the inverse problem . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we address these issues by considering a least - square formulation to identify parameters of the microscopic model on the basis on macroscopic observables . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss the selection of the macroscopic observables which we need to know in order to uniquely determine these parameters . to gain a better intuition and explore the problem without a too high computational load , we mostly focus on the one - dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the newton algorithm can be efficiently used to robustly determine optimal parameters , even if some small statistical noise is present in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thrm]assumption    en physique des milieux poreux , calibrer certains paramtres dun modle microscopique sur la base dexpriences donnant accs  des grandeurs macroscopiques est un enjeu majeur . </S>",
    "<S> cette dmarche est entache derreurs de modle , de mesure et de calculs dans la procdure dhomognisation : le problme direct est biais . </S>",
    "<S> la rsolution du problme inverse , lorsquil sagit destimer les paramtres  partir des observations , engendre aussi des erreurs . </S>",
    "<S> nous considrons ici une formulation `` moindres carrs '' du problme , cherchant  minimiser lerreur entre les quantits macroscopiques observes et celles calcules via lhomognisation alatoire . </S>",
    "<S> nous discutons en particulier de la nature des informations macroscopiques ncessaires pour dterminer de manire univoque les paramtres de la densit de probabilit des proprits microscopiques . </S>",
    "<S> afin dexplorer plus facilement cette question , nous nous intressons ici essentiellement au cas unidimensionel . </S>",
    "<S> nous montrons que le problme peut tre rsolu de manire efficace par lalgorithme de newton , mme en prsence dun petit bruit statistique . </S>"
