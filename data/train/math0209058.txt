    "the notion of a word - hyperbolic group introduced by gromov  @xcite has played a pivotal role in the development of geometric group theory for the last fifteen years . in @xcite gromov also suggested a way of generalizing this notion to that of a group _ relatively hyperbolic _ with respect to a collection of subgroups called _",
    "parabolic subgroups_. several researchers proposed ways of making these ideas precise .",
    "first , farb  @xcite defined relative hyperbolicity by requiring that the cayley graph of a group with cosets of the parabolic subgroups `` coned - off '' is a hyperbolic metric space .",
    "later bowditch  @xcite gave a rigorous interpretation of gromov s original approach which mimics the case of a geometrically finite kleinian group .",
    "recently yaman  @xcite showed that the gromov - bowditch version of relative hyperbolicity can be characterized in terms of convergence group actions .",
    "bowditch had earlier obtained such a characterization for word - hyperbolic groups  @xcite .",
    "szczepaski  @xcite investigated the relationship between different versions of relative hyperbolicity .",
    "he proved that relative hyperbolicity in the sense of gromov - bowditch - yaman implies that of farb but not vice versa .",
    "bowditch  @xcite observed that relative hyperbolicity in the sense of farb together with what farb termed the `` bounded coset penetration property '' implies relative hyperbolicity in the sense of gromov - bowditch - yaman .",
    "a number of interesting results regarding relatively hyperbolic groups are obtained in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "szczepaski  @xcite recently provided a way of constructing groups relatively hyperbolic in the sense of farb by mimicking the hyperbolization of polyhedra construction .    in this paper",
    "we study the class of artin groups , that is , groups given by a presentation of the form :    @xmath8    where for @xmath9 @xmath10 and where @xmath1 for each @xmath11 .",
    "we allow @xmath12 in which case the relation @xmath13 is omitted from presentation  .    in the theory of artin groups a subgroup of an artin group @xmath5 generated by a subset of @xmath14",
    "is called a _",
    "parabolic subgroup _",
    "( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from the results of appel - schupp  @xcite that if in all @xmath15 then for any @xmath11 the two - generator parabolic subgroup @xmath16 is itself an artin group with the presentation    @xmath17    although we will not use the fact , it is easy to see that for an even @xmath18 the group @xmath19 is isomorphic to the baumslag - solitar group @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath21 is odd , then @xmath19 is isomorphic to the torus - knot group @xmath22 .",
    "an artin group is said to be of _ extra large type _ if all @xmath23 in presentation  .",
    "even before the general theory of hyperbolic groups appel and schupp @xcite proved theorems about artin groups of extra large type by showing that they were `` relatively small cancellation '' with respect to the collection of subgroups @xmath19 .",
    "our main result here is :    [ a ] let @xmath5 be an artin group given by presentation   above .",
    "assume that for all @xmath11 we have @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath5 is relatively hyperbolic in the sense of farb with respect to the collection of subgroups @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "thus theorem  [ a ] asserts that @xmath5 is relatively hyperbolic with respect to the family of non - free two - generator parabolic subgroups .",
    "this provides additional justification for using the term `` parabolic subgroup '' in the context of artin groups .",
    "since we do not actually use it , we refer to farb s paper @xcite for the precise definition of the `` bounded coset penetration property . '' but it is easy to see that if two subgroups @xmath26 of a group @xmath5 have infinite intersection then @xmath5 does not satisfy the bounded coset penetration property with respect to the collection @xmath27 ( or with respect to any larger collection of subgroups ) .",
    "thus for an artin group @xmath5 as in theorem  [ a ] if there are distinct @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are finite then @xmath5 does not have the bounded coset penetration property with respect to the collection of subgroups @xmath19 .",
    "this raises the interesting question of finding different conditions which ensure good group - theoretic properties in the presence of farb s definition of relative hyperbolicty .",
    "it seems plausible that most artin groups satisfy some sort of a `` nested '' version of the bounded coset penetration property , especially since many of these groups are known to be cat(0 ) and biautomatic ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we explain how one can apply small cancellation theory to study artin groups , even though the given finite presentation   does not have good small cancellation properties . in order to do this",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of standard small cancellation theory . for definitions and terminology see lyndon and schupp  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath31 be the symmetrized set of words in @xmath32 generated by the defining relator , @xmath33 , and its inverse .",
    "the cancellation between two noninverse elements of @xmath31 can be almost half of each of the words but _ not _ an entire half .",
    "consider , for example , a product such as    @xmath34    it is not difficult to verify that the set @xmath31 satisfies the `` flat '' small cancellation condition @xmath35 . to exploit this fact we must use the right normal form for elements of @xmath36 .    for the remainder of this paper",
    "we denote @xmath37 . in the free group @xmath38",
    "every nontrivial reduced word @xmath39 has a unique _ normal form with exponents _    @xmath40    where each @xmath41 and each @xmath42 .",
    "the integer @xmath43 is the _ syllable length _ of @xmath39 and is written @xmath44 .",
    "the subwords @xmath45 are called the _ syllables _ of @xmath39 .    for each @xmath11 such that @xmath7 let @xmath46 be the set of _ all _ nontrivial cyclically reduced words in @xmath32 which are equal to the identity in the group @xmath19 .    by introducing `` strips '' to study the fine geometry of c(4)-t(4 ) diagrams , appel and schupp",

    "we now show that @xmath78 is strongly artin reduced .",

    "this was noted , for example , in  @xcite .            note that if we barycentrically subdivide each of the @xmath121-edges of @xmath107 to obtain the graph @xmath247 , then twice the metric of @xmath107 coincides with the simplicial metric for @xmath247 .",
    "hence to establish theorem  [ thm : rel ] by using papasoglu s criterion it suffices to show that geodesic bigons in @xmath107 ( with endpoints possibly inside edges ) are uniformly thin .",
    "moreover , the definition of @xmath107 implies that it is enough to prove the following :            to verify the claim , let @xmath263 be such that @xmath264 and @xmath265 . by proposition",
