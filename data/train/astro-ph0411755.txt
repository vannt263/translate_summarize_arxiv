    "we observed sn 1995n with _ xmm - newton _ for 72 ks on july 27 , 2003 , nine years after the explosion .",
    "here we present a preliminary analysis of this observation ( for details see * ? ? ? * hereafter z04 ) .",
    "the x - ray pointing was coordinated with near - ir and optical observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray data set was heavily affected by solar flares .",
    "we analysed the longer _ xmm _ epic exposures of both the mos and pn detectors ( 56 and 64 ks respectively ) .",
    "data were filtered using the count rate criterion @xmath5 0.5 counts s@xmath2 for the epic mos and @xmath5 1.0 counts",
    "s@xmath2 for the epic pn , leaving 22 and 14 ks of useful data , respectively .",
    "source counts were estracted from a circular region of 20@xmath6 centered on the radio position of the supernova @xcite .",
    "background counts were estracted from a circular region of 40@xmath6 , on the same ccd .",
    "the source count rate was 9.7@xmath7 counts s@xmath2 for the epic mos ( @xmath4450 counts ) and 3.3 @xmath8 counts s@xmath2 for the epic pn ( @xmath4500 counts ) .",
    "epic mos and pn spectra were binned requiring at least 15 counts per bin .",
    "joint mos and pn spectral fits were performed in the 0.2 - 10.0 kev interval with an overall normalization constant . despite the low statistics , the fit with single component models was not satisfactory ( see z04 ) .",
    "the improvement obtained adding a mekal component to a single component spectral models was significant at the @xmath44@xmath9 level .",
    "the best fit was obtained with an absorbed double mekal model with column density of the interstellar medium @xmath10 @xmath1 and temperatures of the two thermal components @xmath11 0.8 and 9.5 kev ( @xmath12 ; see figure [ fig1 ] , _ left panel _ ) .",
    "we also report the detection of a faint object inside the x - ray error box of sn 1995n in the summed _ xmm _ om @xmath13 image .",
    "the object was at the limit of detectability in each single frame .",
    "its position in the summed image is within 0.4@xmath14 from the radio position of sn 1995n . within the errors of the astrometric calibration",
    ", we then identify this object with sn 1995n .",
    "the lack of reference stars in the @xmath13 band prevented us from performing a photometric calibration of the image .",
    "taking the detection limit count rate of a single image as a lower bound for the uvw1 flux of sn 1995n , we estimate @xmath15 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( _ right panel _ ) shows the fluxes derived from all the available x - ray observations of sn 1995n .",
    "the first x - ray observation was performed with _",
    "hri on july 23 , 1996 ( 1.3 ks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , followed by other two exposures taken on august 12 , 1996 ( 17 ks ) and on august 17 , 1997 ( 19 ks ) .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "fluxes were derived from the count rates reported by @xcite , assuming a power - law spectrum with photon index and column density from their fit of the _ asca _ spectra .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "observation was performed on january 19 , 1998 ( 83 and 96 ks , respectively for the sis and gis instruments ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for _ asca _ and _ xmm _ , the fluxes reported in figure [ fig1 ] are the average between the different instruments .",
    "it is worth noting the large decrease in the x - ray flux between the _ asca _ and _ xmm _ observations ( unabsorbed [ 0.2 - 10.0 kev ] fluxes of 1.65 @xmath16 and 1.75 @xmath17 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 , respectively ) .",
    "sn 1995n is one of the few supernovae detected in x - rays at an age of @xmath49 years .",
    "our _ xmm _ observation shows that the unabsorbed x - ray flux of sn 1995n dropped at a value of @xmath18 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 , about an order of magnitude lower than that of the previous _ asca _ observation performed @xmath46 years before .",
    "the decline of the x - ray flux is signalling that sn 1995n probably started to evolve towards the remnant stage . interpreting",
    "the evolution of the x - ray light curve is not straigthforward .",
    "a complex scenario in which a two - phase ( clumpy and smooth ) csm contributes to the observed x - ray emission is consistent with the available data ( see z04 ) .",
    "the epic spectrum of sn 1995n shows statistically significant evidence for the presence of two distinct thermal ( mekal ) components at temperatures of 0.8 and 9.5 kev , respectively . in the standard model of ejecta",
    "/ wind interaction @xcite , these represent the temperatures of the gas between the contact discontinuity and the reverse / forward shock .",
    "the temperature of the hotter phase is similar to the temperature of the single - component spectral fit of the _ asca _ data performed by @xcite . within the assumptions of the standard model",
    ", we can derive the exponent of the ejecta density distribution @xmath19 from the expression @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the exponent of the cms density distribution @xcite . assuming a constant and homogeneous stellar wind ( @xmath22 ) , from the values of the temperatures @xmath23 and @xmath24 inferred from the x - ray spectrum , we obtain @xmath25 .",
