    "<S> the measured temperature dependence and the overall magnitude of the measured mechanical @xmath22-factor are seen to be much smaller than any of these comparisons , suggesting that surface effects and/or fabrication - induced damage may be playing an important role in the mechanical damping of the nanosctructed devices studied here .    beyond the confinement and localization of acoustic modes in three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the connected geometry of the 2d - omc structures presented in this work offers a platform for more complex phonon - photon circuitry . </S>",

    "<S> the functionality of these devices are based upon the slow propagation velocity and long relative lifetime of phonons in comparison to photons , which allows for the storage , buffering , and narrowband filtering of optical signals . </S>",
