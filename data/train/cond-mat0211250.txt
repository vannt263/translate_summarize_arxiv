    "appearance of energy gaps in three - dimensional(3d ) systems is a hallmark of quantum mechanics in crystals . there , a periodicity , be it atomic or density - wave formation from some mechanism , gives rise to a bragg s reflection accompanied by energy gaps as bloch s theorem dictates .",
    "apart from this , there is few occurrences of energy gaps in 3d ( unless of course non - perturbative , many - body states such as the bcs state are involved ) .    in two - dimensional(2d )",
    "systems , by contrast , we do have a remarkable realization of gaps when a magnetic field is applied . for a free 2d electron gas the spectrum even coalesces into a series of sharp landau levels .",
    "when the 2d system has some periodicity ( thought of as arising from a periodic potential or tight - binding array of atoms ) , application of a magnetic field gives rise to a fractal energy gaps , which is called `` hofstadter s butterfly''@xcite .",
    "one way to realize why the butterfly appears is that the two quantizations , one being bloch s band structure and the other the landau quantization , interfere with each other .",
    "the interference should occur when the band gap , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 : electron mass , @xmath6 : lattice constant ) , and the cyclotron energy , @xmath7 , are similar , which indeed amounts to the condition for the appearance of the butterfly , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the magnetic flux penetrating a unit cell and @xmath10 the flux quantum .",
    "once we have an energy gap in a 2d system it is known that the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) should occur . thouless _",
    "et al_@xcite in fact have derived a general formula for the quantized hall conductance in 2d periodic systems without any assumption on the periodicity , and shown that the hall conductance can be written in terms of some topological invariants .",
    "a natural question is whether we can extend such arguments to 3d systems .",
    "it has been shown that , _ if _ an energy gap exists in 3d , it should accompany an iqhe where each component of the hall tensor @xmath11 is quantized@xcite . a big question , then , is whether and how gaps can appear in 3d .",
    "we have previously shown that the butterfly - like spectrum indeed appears in _ anisotropic _",
    "3d ( quasi-1d ) lattice and have derived the quantized hall tensor for each gap.@xcite for the anisotropic case we can intuitively understand these in terms of a mapping between the 3d case and a 2d case . for the isotropic case , however , it seems difficult to have the energy gaps since the magnetic subbands are likely to be overlapped by the large dispersion along the magnetic field .",
    "several authors @xcite have computed the energy spectra of the isotropic 3d tight - binding system under magnetic fields pointing to high - symmetry crystallographic directions , and kunszt@xcite concluded that there is in general no energy gaps although the possibility of gaps can not be excluded .",
    "so the existence of gaps and iqhe remains an open question .    in this paper",
    ", we show that we do have energy gaps in _ isotropic _",
    "3d lattices rather universally in that all we have to have is the sufficiently large magnetic field @xmath0 pointing to general directions ( i.e. , off the high - symmetry axes ) .",
    "we first show this by calculating energy spectra for various directions of @xmath0 .",
    "we have also calculated the hall tensors , @xmath12 , when the fermi energy is in each energy gap .",
    "they turn out to have values , e.g. @xmath13 in an appropriate unit , even for a fixed direction of @xmath0 , which is surprising and unlike in the anisotropic case .",
    "we then intuitively explain such structures in the spectra by introducing a `` duality '' , which connects the 3d system in a strong @xmath0 with another problem in a weak magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "this enable us to regard the band structure and the quantization of the 3d hall conductivity as graphically arising from quantum mechanical hopping between `` semiclassical '' orbits in the weak-@xmath15 case .",
    "we take a non - interacting tight - binding model in a uniform magnetic field @xmath16 pointing to an arbitrary direction .",
    "schrdinger s equation is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wave function at site @xmath19 , the summation is over nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath20 is the peierls phase with the vector potential , @xmath21 . we consider a simple - cubic lattice with a lattice constant @xmath6 .",
    "following kunszt and zee,@xcite we take a gauge @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is cyclic .",
    "we can then write @xmath24 where @xmath25 are site indices along @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "schrdinger s equation is then reduced to a two - dimensional tight - binding model , @xmath27}f_{l , m-1 } \\nonumber \\\\     & -&t_y e^{-2\\pi i \\phi_z [ l-(\\phi_x/\\phi_y)m]}f_{l , m+1}\\nonumber \\\\    & - & 2t_z \\cos[2 \\pi ( \\phi_x l - \\phi_y m ) + \\lambda_z ] f_{l , m } = e f_{l , m }    \\label{harp3d},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the transfer energy and @xmath29 with @xmath30 is respective number of flux quanta penetrating the facet of the unit cell normal to @xmath31 . here",
    "we consider rational fluxes , @xmath32 with @xmath33 : integers and @xmath34 s are mutually prime integers . by introducing @xmath35",
    ", we can eliminate @xmath5 from the phase factors ( exponentials and the argument of cosine in eq .",
    "( [ harp3d ] ) ) , so we can write @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is determined from a one - dimensional equation , @xmath38 }    g_{j+n_x }     -t_y e^{-i(2\\pi \\phi \\frac{n_z}{n_y } j-\\lambda_y ) }    g_{j - n_x } \\nonumber \\\\     & - & 2t_z \\cos ( -2 \\pi \\phi j - \\lambda_z ) g_{j } = e g_{j }    \\label{harpreduced}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the phase factors have a common periodicity @xmath39 , we can apply the bloch - floquet theorem to have @xmath40 , and the hamiltonian is reduced to a @xmath41 matrix .",
    "our aim is to search systematically for gapful spectra for the isotropic case with @xmath42 and to determine the hall conductivities for each energy gap .",
    "we have numerically solved eq.([harpreduced ] ) and obtained the energy spectra versus @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig_btfl ] shows the results for typical field directions : @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , which differ in symmetry . in each case",
    "we took 16 points for each of the bloch wavenumbers @xmath46 .",
    "we can immediately see that a series of gaps appear for @xmath47 , while otherwise we have at most solitary gaps . from such results",
    "we have found that the spectrum has a series of gaps _ when no two @xmath34 s coincide and @xmath48_. so we can say that the gapful spectrum can be expected when @xmath0 points to general directions ( i.e. , off high - symmetry crystallographic axes ) .",
    "the gaps shrinks when @xmath15 is too small ( @xmath49 ) obviously .",
    "now we proceed to the quantum hall effect .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath50 in an energy gap dictates@xcite quantized hall conductivities , @xmath51 where @xmath52 s are integers satisfying a diophantine s equation , @xmath53 here @xmath54 is an integer , @xmath55 is the filling of the tight - binding band , and @xmath52 s assigned to each gap are topological invariants , i.e. , they never change when external parameters ( magnetic field , transfer energies , etc ) are changed as long as the gap remains .",
    "so eq.([dio3d ] ) tells us that , if we consider @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 in a 4d parameter space @xmath57 , the @xmath55 plotted along a gap assigned with @xmath58 will form a ` 3d plane ' having a gradient @xmath58 in the 4d space .",
    "in fact we can readily translate the @xmath59-@xmath43 diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig_btfl ] to the @xmath55-@xmath43 diagram by counting the number of subbands below each value of @xmath59 .",
    "there , the gradient @xmath60 for each gap gives @xmath61 .",
    "we can then scan the direction of @xmath0 to determine all of @xmath62 by keeping track of each gap in question , which is exactly how we have obtained the hall integers here .",
    "the result is shown as triple integers in fig .",
    "[ fig_btfl ] .",
    "we can see that the largest series of gaps have @xmath63 or @xmath64 , where only one of the hall components is nonzero .",
    "this is strikingly new in that one and the same butterfly contains all the cases with @xmath65 , respectively , for a fixed direction of @xmath0 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the butterfly in the anisotropic case@xcite where one component @xmath66 is identically zero with @xmath67 being the most conductive direction .",
    "hence the versatile behavior of @xmath58 may be regarded as a hallmark of the isotropic 3d qhe .    when the above condition is not satisfied ( i.e. , when two @xmath34 s coincide as in @xmath68 and @xmath69 or at least one @xmath70 as in @xmath45 ) , only solitary gaps or zero gaps ( marked with dashed lines ) appear .",
    "hasegawa has shown for the case of @xmath69 that two bands touch where the energy dispersion is similar to those of a dirac particle .",
    "we have similar band touching in fig.[fig_btfl](b)@xmath68 as well , for which a detailed calculation shows that the dispersion around the band touching is indeed linear in @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for the band touching can be accounted for as follows . for @xmath71 ( b )",
    ", the gap for @xmath72 and that for @xmath73 appear along the same line in the @xmath55-@xmath43 diagram , since the problem is symmetric against @xmath74 . if there were no band touching , the hall integers for @xmath75 and @xmath73 would become indefinite , which contradicts with the topological argument that we can always determine @xmath52 s uniquely when the gap is nonzero .",
    "so we can conclude that the band touching always occurs when two @xmath34 s coincide .",
    "this explains why the series of gaps seen in case ( a ) disappear as we make @xmath76 in ( b ) and then @xmath77 in ( c ) .",
    "we still have to explain why the butterfly does not appear in case ( d ) with one of @xmath34 s being zero .",
    "we address this question from a different viewpoint in the next section .",
    "electrons in magnetic fields are usually described in @xmath79-space .",
    "a textbook example is the semiclassical picture , where an electron is treated as a classical particle driven in @xmath79-space by a weak magnetic field .",
    "as @xmath15 becomes stronger , the semiclassical orbits begin to be mixed and the picture breaks down .",
    "actually this quantum mixing plays a critical role in opening the gaps and in quantization of the hall conductivity as shown in the following .",
    "we propose here that there exists a duality that relates a semiclassical picture in @xmath79-space ( weak-@xmath15 case ) to another semiclassical picture in the opposite limit of strong magnetic field , in which the _ guiding center _ of the cyclotron motion drifts along equipotential contours in the real space .",
    "using a quantum mechanical mapping from the weak-@xmath15 case to the strong-@xmath15 case ( where @xmath15 translates into @xmath80 ) , we are able to discuss the mixing of semiclassical orbits in our problem ( 3d lattice in @xmath0 ) in a clear cut .",
    "let us derive the duality in 2d and then extend it to 3d .",
    "we consider a 2d bloch electron with the dispersion @xmath81 in a magnetic field @xmath15 perpendicular to the plane . if we define the dynamical wavevector @xmath82 , the hamiltonian in @xmath83-space is written as @xmath84 = -ieb/\\hbar . \\label{kxky}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is an exact quantum equation except that we have neglected the inter - band mixing due to the magnetic field , which is allowed when the periodic potential is strong enough ( or the magnetic field is weak enough ) .",
    "the equation reduces to the semiclassical one in the limit @xmath85 .",
    "if we consider another 2d system in a magnetic field @xmath15 with a periodic potential @xmath86 with @xmath87 , the hamiltonian in real space is written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the cyclotron - motion guiding center with the relative coordinate given as @xmath91 .",
    "when the magnetic field is strong enough ( or the potential @xmath92 is weak enough ) so that ( i ) the magnetic length @xmath93 is much shorter than the length scale over which @xmath92 varies , and that ( ii ) the different landau levels are not mixed , we can consider @xmath94 to be frozen .",
    "more precisely , the kinetic energy ( the first term in eq.([xy-1 ] ) ) reduces to a constant from ( ii ) , while the second term can be approximated as @xmath95 from ( i ) .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes , up to a constant , @xmath96 = i\\hbar/(eb ) .",
    "\\label{xy-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see that eqs .",
    "( [ kxky ] ) and ( [ xy-2 ] ) are identical if we translate as @xmath97 so we can see that there exists a duality between the 2d system with a strong periodic potential in a weak @xmath15 ( one band tight - binding model ) and the 2d system with a weak periodic potential in a strong field ( one landau level approximation ) .",
    "for the landau level in the latter case we expect that the duality holds best in the lowest landau level , since the wavefunction is most localized in that level to make eq .",
    "( [ xy-2 ] ) valid .",
    "the duality introduced here provides a physical basis for hofstadter s observation@xcite on the mapping between the tight - binding and weak - potential systems@xcite for the square lattice , and also generally applicable to any 2d lattices , or , remarkably , 3d cases as well as we shall see below .",
    "another duality is found by ishikawa _",
    "et al_@xcite , which is distinct from ours in that one landau level is mapped to one landau level in the latter while one landau level is mapped to one bloch band in the present case .",
    "now we apply the duality to 3d systems , which enables us to have a fresh look at the 3d qhe .",
    "we take the bloch electron with the dispersion @xmath98 in a magnetic field @xmath99 .",
    "let us again denote the direction of @xmath0 as @xmath100 whose components will be assigned a set of integers .",
    "we set a new frame @xmath101 in which the magnetic field point to @xmath102 .",
    "if we take the vector potential @xmath103 with @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 where @xmath106 @xmath107 with @xmath108 = -ieb/\\hbar$ ] while @xmath109 remains a quantum number .",
    "we can thus apply the above duality to this system , which implies that the 3d system can be mapped to a system in a fictitious 2d space @xmath110 with a potential @xmath111 in a fictitious magnetic field @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "the mapping is valid for a large @xmath112 , i.e. , a small @xmath15 .",
    "the fictitious potential is a cross section of the 3d dispersion incised at @xmath109 by a plane perpendicular to @xmath0 . as we shift @xmath109 , the 2d potential changes accordingly , and the spectrum is determined by taking all the possible values of @xmath109 .",
    "we take a cubic dispersion , @xmath114 which is written in the new frame as , @xmath115 \\nonumber\\\\ & - & t_y \\cos[{\\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}}_y \\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_{\\perp } + ( n_y / n)k_{z ' } a ] \\nonumber\\\\ & - & t_z \\cos[{\\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}}_z",

    "the hamiltonian for the fictitious 2d system is @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 is a vector potential for the fictitious magnetic field @xmath123 .",
    "since we assume a large @xmath112 , schrdinger s equation can be written within the basis for the lowest landau level , which reads , after a certain phase transformation , @xmath124 }    \\psi_{j+n_x \\nonumber \\\\     & - & \\tilde{t}_y e^{-i [ 2\\pi \\phi \\frac{n_z}{n_y}(j-\\frac{n_x}{2})-\\lambda_y ] }    \\psi_{j - n_x } \\nonumber \\\\     & - & 2\\tilde{t}_z \\cos ( -2 \\pi \\phi j - \\lambda_z ) \\psi_j = e \\psi_j .",

    "now the duality implies that eq.([harpreduced2 ] ) should reduce to eq.([harpreduced ] ) in the strong @xmath112 limit ( i.e. , weak @xmath15 limit ) , since @xmath130 should become smaller than the potential range @xmath131 so that @xmath132 tends to @xmath133 .",
    "the mapping via the duality enables us to see how the total spectrum comes from dispersion relations versus @xmath109 , which helps intuitively understanding how the energy gaps open and how the hall conductivities are quantized .",
    "since the mapping is limited to the weak-@xmath15 case , we examine the situation where the gaps begin to open in the quantum regime approached from the semiclassical one .",
    "we show in fig.[fig_band ] the band structure versus @xmath109 for the fictitious system ( eq.([harpreduced2 ] ) ) , along with the fictitious potential @xmath111 for fixed values of @xmath109 .",
    "let us first look at how the energy spectra can have gaps for general directions of @xmath134 in fig.[fig_band](a ) ] .",
    "@xmath135 accommodates closed orbits around its peaks and dips in the `` semiclassical picture '' in the language for the weak-@xmath15 ( strong-@xmath112 ) case , where the area enclosed by each orbit must be a multiple of @xmath136 .",
    "so the different wells have different sets of discrete levels , where each level moves on the energy axis as @xmath109 is changed , since @xmath135 changes its form with @xmath109 . when the levels belonging to the wells adjacent in @xmath137-space coincide",
    ", the states will strongly resonate quantum - mechanically and an energy gap will arise . in fig.[fig_band](a ) , we show the case where the gaps begin to open with @xmath138 , for which the strong mixing of orbits is seen to result in significant level repulsions .",
    "we attach for comparison the result for an almost semiclassical case when the magnetic field , @xmath139 , is so small that the mixing is weak and the level repulsion is almost negligible except for the middle of the total band .    in terms of the semi - classical orbits ,",
    "the change in @xmath109 causes the orbits to hop to adjacent positions at every resonance as shown in fig.[fig_band ] .",
    "a virtue of this picture is that _ the distance and the direction of the hopping exactly indicates the hall integers _ , as shown in the following , if we apply an infinitesimal electric field @xmath140 to the system , @xmath109 is dragged adiabatically according to an equation , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the component parallel to @xmath143 .",
    "after @xmath109 is changed by @xmath144 ( the period with which the spectrum repeats itself ) , every state must come back to the equivalent position in the reciprocal unit cell .",
    "note here that the cell boundaries ( represented in fig.[fig_band ] as white lines ) also move as @xmath109 is changed , since the brillouin zone boundaries are oblique with @xmath145 .",
    "the increment in @xmath83-space , @xmath146 , with which the orbit is shifted over the one period satisfies @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 correspond to positive and negative @xmath150 , respectively , and @xmath151 s are integers assigned to each subband .",
    "the integers satisfy a relation @xmath152 , since @xmath153 .",
    "we can immediately translate @xmath154 into the motion in the real space normal to @xmath143 using the relationship between the relative coordinate @xmath155 and the dynamical wavenumber @xmath156 , @xmath157 since the system has no dissipation as long as @xmath50 is in a gap , @xmath142 should cause no net current along @xmath143 .",
    "therefore the velocity averaged over on period driven by @xmath142 is just the ratio of @xmath158 and the one period ( @xmath159 , which leads to @xmath160 .",
    "the hall current due to @xmath142 is calculated as @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the density of states per subband and per unit volume . from this expression",
    "we can write the hall tensor as @xmath163 , where @xmath164 , and @xmath165 represents the component normal to @xmath143 . on the other hand , the normal component of the electric field , @xmath166 causes a classical drift in the direction normal to @xmath143 with the velocity @xmath167 , which immediately leads to @xmath168 . combining the two , we finally obtain the quantized hall conductivity carried by the corresponding subband , @xmath169 we have thus derived the quantization of the 3d hall conductivity from the @xmath79-space hopping , as an approach alternative to the usual kubo formula .",
    "the problem of the transport in adiabatically varying potentials ( so - called thouless pumping ) was first considered by thouless@xcite for one - dimensional case .",
    "he showed that the 2d qhe in periodic potentials may be understood in terms of a fictitious 1d system having two periodic potentials that slide adiabatically with each other .",
    "the discussion we have given here to describe the 3d qhe may be regarded as a two - dimensional version of the thouless pumping .",
    "we can actually identify the hall integers @xmath151 for each subband by keeping track of the motion of the orbits with @xmath109 .",
    "figure 2(a ) typically depicts how a state in the first band moves by ( 1,0,0 ) , by which we mean the state jumps once across a reciprocal cell boundary normal to @xmath170 ( whose intersection is shown as one of the white lines in fig.2 ) but not across @xmath171 or @xmath172 .",
    "the state in the second band moves by @xmath173 .",
    "these triple numbers are the very hall integers , @xmath174 , carried by each subband ( not to be confused with the total hall integer ) , and are in accordance with the small @xmath175 region in fig.[fig_btfl](a ) .",
    "we can now comment on the relation with the usual treatment of 3d qhe@xcite . by summing up @xmath176 over the occupied subbands , we have @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the number of occupied subbands and @xmath179 is the summation of @xmath180 over them .",
    "since @xmath178 is related to the filling of the tight - binding band in @xmath181 , we obtain @xmath182 which coincides with the diophantine equation ( [ dio3d ] ) for @xmath183 .",
    "this means that in our picture above , only the gaps with @xmath183 are taken into account while the rest are neglected .",
    "we can actually show that the gap associated with @xmath184 only occurs , when the magnetic field is weak ( @xmath185 ) , as a small gap between very dispersive bands ( versus @xmath109 ) , so that the gap vanishes in the spectrum .",
    "weak field regime is exactly the situation considered here , since we are approaching to the quantum regime from the semiclassical one .",
    "the discussion here is for the lower half of the tight - binding band , while we can make a similar argument for the upper half in terms of hole orbits , which can be obtained as an electron - hole transformation ( on the @xmath55-@xmath43 diagram ) , which in turn corresponds to @xmath186 in the diophantine equation .",
    "the mapped picture also gives an intuitive explanation why we have so few gaps for the symmetric case fig.[fig_band](b),(c ) , and zero - component case ( d ) .",
    "when two components in @xmath187 coincide as in fig.[fig_band](b ) with @xmath188 , while two levels cross ( for the value of @xmath109 labeled as b ) , a gap does not arise because the couplings along @xmath170 and @xmath171 occur symmetrically ( in a zigzag fashion ) , so that the bands do not split , which is exactly the band touching discussed in sec .",
    "when the symmetry is even higher with @xmath189 in fig.[fig_band](c ) , couplings along @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 all become symmetric and the band touching occurs at every energy crossing . if @xmath187 contains a zero component as in ( d ) , two of the plane waves for @xmath135 become parallel and the wells having the same depth become connected along the perpendicular direction .",
    "this results in a strong mixing between the states along that trough direction , so that the minibands for each value of @xmath109 become wider .",
    "so , while the energy gap does arise when the energies of the adjacent troughs coincide , these gaps tend to be overlapped in energy by other , wide bands .",
    "in the previous paper@xcite we have shown that an analogue of hofstadter s butterfly arises ( i ) as a function of the _ tilting angle _ @xmath190 in magnetic field tilted in @xmath191-plane ( ii ) in _ anisotropic _",
    "( @xmath192 ) 3d lattices .",
    "if we apply the above argument to this case , we see that the fictitious potential @xmath135 is dominated by the cosine band associated with the conductive direction , @xmath67 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_aniso ] this gives rise to one - dimensional bound states in its troughs and ridges with a small perturbation due to @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "so the system can be regarded as an array of independent chains with two periods , which is described by a harper s equation for the 2d hofstadter s problem , and thus we can understand why the anisotropic case can have many gaps around the top and bottom of the band as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_aniso ] , while one component @xmath66 is fixed to 0 unlike the isotropic case .",
    "we have just shown that two different systems related by the duality have similar energy spectra",
    ". it would be then interesting to see how the hall conductivities are related between them for the corresponding energy gaps . for the 2d case , thouless _",
    "et al_@xcite have shown the relationship between the hall integers in the tight - binding and in the strong - field limits . here",
    "we first review this in the context of our duality before moving on to the 3d case .",
    "diophantine s equation for an energy gap in the 2d tight - binding case ( a 2d version of eq.[dio3d ] ) is @xmath195 where @xmath196 are integers , @xmath55 the tight - binding band filling , and @xmath9 the number of fluxes penetrating the 2d unit cell .",
    "the equation for the corresponding gap in the 2d strong - field case is written with the same @xmath196 as @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the landau - level filling factor , i.e. , the fraction of the filled states in the lowest landau level , and @xmath9 is replaced with @xmath199 according to the duality ( eq.[duality ] ) . from the relation @xmath200",
    ", we can translate eq.([dio - sf ] ) into @xmath201 now we can see that the two topological integers @xmath54 and @xmath202 are _ interchanged _ between the dual [ ( tight - binding ( [ dio - tb ] ) @xmath203 strong - field ( [ dio - sf2 ] ) ] cases .",
    "the widom - strda formula,@xcite @xmath204 indeed dictates that the hall conductivity is the gradient in @xmath55-@xmath9 diagram , which gives @xmath205 in the former case @xmath206 in the latter .",
    "this results can be readily extend to the 3d case .",
    "namely , if we take an energy gap in the 3d system with @xmath207 , the hall conductivity in the corresponding 2d system becomes @xmath208 , where @xmath52 and @xmath54 are related via eq.([dio3d ] ) .",
    "let us comment on the magnitude of the magnetic field required to observe the energy gaps in 3d systems . for that it is essential that the coupling between the semiclassical orbits in the different wells exists .",
    "for the isotropic crystals considered here , the area enclosed by the semiclassical orbit in @xmath79-space should be of the order of the typical well area , @xmath209 , which is simply @xmath210 .",
    "the situation is the same as in the 2d hofstadter problem , so the required field for atomic lattice constants is huge ( @xmath211 t for @xmath2122  ) . if we consider systems with larger unit cells , as in solid fullerene or zeolites with @xmath21210  , the required @xmath15 is reduced to @xmath213 t but still large . in the anisotropic case discussed in ref.@xcite , by contrast ,",
    "the required is much less stringent .",
    "this is because the typical well area is @xmath214 with @xmath215 being the typical valley width , so the condition relaxes to @xmath216 , which can be made as small as one wishes by increasing the anisotropy ( since @xmath217 leads to @xmath218 ) , although the scale of the energy gap shrinks .",
    "so it is a trade - off between large @xmath15 required with large energy gaps ( isotropic case ) and smaller @xmath15 suffices with small gaps ( anisotropic ) .",
    "another point is that a real 3d sample has always surfaces .",
    "halperin and the present authors have shown in general that the 3d integer qhe should accompany quantized _ wrapping _ current , whose intensity and direction are dictated by the quantum hall integers@xcite .",
    "this should apply to the present case of isotropic qhe .",
    "we have investigated the energy spectra in the isotropic 3d lattice in magnetic fields applied in arbitrary directions , for which we have shown that the energy gaps arise unless the magnetic field points to high - symmetry directions .",
    "we have also calculated the quantum hall integers . in the latter part of the paper",
    "we have introduced a duality that relates @xmath78 ( i.e. , guiding center picture in strong @xmath15 and semiclassical picture in weak @xmath15 ) for the present 3d problem , which gives the graphic explanation of the quantization of the hall conductivity in 3d and the condition for the butterfly spectrum .",
