    "the spin glass ( sg ) phase@xcite is not stable at finite temperature in two dimensions ( 2d ) . when the energies are not quantized , the behavior at @xmath13 can be understood in terms of a scaling theory,@xcite which is usually called the droplet model .",

    "the hamiltonian of the edwards - anderson model for ising spins is @xmath19 where each spin @xmath20 is a dynamical variable which has two allowed states , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 indicates a sum over nearest neighbors on a simple square lattice of size @xmath24 .",
    "the standard model for quantized energies is the @xmath25 model , where we choose each bond @xmath26 to be an independent identically distributed ( iid ) quenched random variable , with the probability distribution @xmath27 thus we actually set @xmath28 , as usual .",

    "( [ eq : pj ] ) , the ea hamiltonian is equivalent to the @xmath31 gauge glass model.@xcite wang , harrington and preskill@xcite have argued that the anomalous behavior of the @xmath25 model is caused by topological long - range order , as a consequence of the gauge symmetry .    along the @xmath32 axis",
    "this model exhibits a phase transition from a ferromagneticly ordered phase @xcite for small concentrations @xmath33 of the antiferromagnetic bonds to a sg critical line at large values @xmath34 ( and @xmath35 due to the bipartite symmetry of the square lattice ) .",
    "recently , this phase transition was characterized by high - precision ground - state calculations,@xcite which have in particular yielded @xmath36 .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase persists at finite temperatures @xmath37 for @xmath38 , while the spin - glass correlations become long - range only at zero temperature.@xcite interestingly , @xmath39,@xcite _ i.e. _ the ferromagnetic phase is reentrant .",
    "the first hint of the remarkable behavior of the @xmath25 model in the sg regime was observed by wang and swendsen.@xcite they found that , although for periodic boundary conditions there is an energy gap of @xmath40 between the ground states ( gs ) and the first excited states , the specific heat when @xmath41 appeared to be proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "this result was questioned by saul and kardar.@xcite the behavior of the specific heat was finally demonstrated in a convincing fashion by lukic _",
    "et al._@xcite saul and kardar also found that the scaling of the dw entropy with size did not appear to agree with the prediction of the droplet model.@xcite this issue has recently been clarified,@xcite and the dw entropy scaling anomaly has been associated with zero - energy domain walls .    in this work",
    "we explore the behavior of the @xmath25 model inside the full sg phase @xmath43 ( the behavior @xmath44 is equivalent due to the symmetry of the model ) .",
    "in particular we study the finite - size scaling behavior of the gs energy , of the fluctuations of the gs energy , and of the domain - wall energy .",
    "we also employ aspect - ratio ( ar ) scaling , @xcite _ i.e. _ we study rectangular lattices of width @xmath45 and height @xmath46 , the aspect ratio being @xmath47 .",
    "carter , bray and moore@xcite have extended ar scaling to the ising sg , and demonstrated that studying the scaling as a function of @xmath10 is an effective method for calculating the exponent @xmath15 . here , we look at the limit @xmath12 and show that ar indeed works for the @xmath25 model as well , in contrast to previous attempts.@xcite the entire probability distribution @xmath48 has a simple gaussian form for small @xmath10 , although , as we will show , the underlying assumption of independent contributions to the dw energy is not strictly valid .",
    "we define domain walls for the sg as it was done in the seminal work of mcmillan.@xcite we look at differences in the gs energy between two samples with the same set of bonds , and the same boundary conditions in one direction , but different boundary conditions in the other direction .",
    "in particular we use periodic ( p ) or antiperiodic ( ap ) boundary conditions along the * x*-axis and free boundary conditions along the * y*-axis . for an example of a dw created in such a way , cf .",
    "[ fig : normaldestroyed ] . for each set of bonds ,",
    "the dw energy @xmath14 is then defined to be the difference in the gs energies of the two different boundary conditions : @xmath49        we use a so - called _ matching algorithm _ to calculate the gs.@xcite let us now sketch just the basic ideas of the matching algorithm",
    ". for the details , see refs .  .",
    "the algorithm allows us to find ground states for lattices which are planar graphs .",
    "this is the reason why we apply ( anti-)periodic boundary conditions only in one direction , * x * , while the other direction , * y * , has free boundary conditions . in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : matching ] a small 2d system with ( for simplicity ) free boundary conditions in both directions is shown .",
    "all spins are assumed to be `` up '' , hence all antiferromagnetic bonds are not satisfied .",
    "if one draws a dashed line perpendicular to each broken bond , one ends up with the situation shown in the figure : all dashed lines start or end at frustrated plaquettes and each frustrated plaquette is connected to exactly one other frustrated plaquette by a dashed line .",
    "each pair of plaquettes is then said to be _",
    "matched_. in general , closed loops of broken bonds unrelated to frustrated plaquettes can also appear , but this is possible only for excited states .",
    "now , one can consider the frustrated plaquettes as the vertices and all possible pairs of connections as the edges of a ( dual ) graph .",
    "the dashed lines are selected from the edges connecting the vertices and called a _ perfect _ matching , since _ all _ plaquettes are matched .",
    "one can assign weights to the edges in the dual graph , the weights are equal to the sum of the absolute values of the bonds crossed by the dashed lines .",
    "the weight @xmath50 of the matching is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges contained in the matching .",
    "as we have seen , @xmath50 counts the broken bonds , hence , the energy of the configuration is given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : pj ] ) .",
    "note that this holds for _ any _ configuration of the spins , if one also includes closed loops in @xmath50 , since a corresponding matching always exists .    obtaining",
    "a gs means minimizing the total weight of the broken bonds ( see right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : matching ] ) .",
    "this automatically forbids closed loops of broken bonds , so one is looking for a _ minimum - weight perfect matching_. this problem is solvable in polynomial time .",
    "the algorithms for minimum - weight perfect matchings@xcite are among the most complicated algorithms for polynomial problems .",
    "fortunately the leda library offers a very efficient implementation,@xcite which we have applied here .    with free boundary conditions in at least one direction , @xmath14 is a multiple of 2 ( since @xmath28 ) .",
    "when periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions are applied in both the * x * and * y * directions , however , @xmath14 becomes a multiple of 4 if the number of @xmath22 bonds is even .",
    "if the number of @xmath22 bonds is odd , @xmath14 takes on values @xmath53 with these boundary conditions .",
    "when @xmath46 is odd , changing the boundary conditions in the * x * direction from periodic to antiperiodic changes the number of @xmath22 bonds from odd to even , or vice versa .",
    "the behavior of the dw energy for the @xmath25 model with @xmath54 was discussed previously.@xcite for the boundary conditions we are using , the average @xmath55 goes to zero exponentially as @xmath10 becomes much greater than one . here",
    "@xmath56 denotes an average over the ensemble of random bond distributions for an @xmath6 lattice .",
    "we can understand this result by thinking of the system as consisting of blocks of size @xmath57 pasted together along the * x * direction .",
    "the probability of having a zero - energy domain wall in each block is almost independent of the other blocks .",
    "the same thing happens when @xmath46 is even if the boundary conditions in the * y * direction are periodic or antiperiodic .",
    "however , if @xmath46 is odd and the boundary conditions in the * y * direction are periodic or antiperiodic , @xmath55 goes to 2 at large @xmath10 , because then @xmath58 is not allowed .",
    "since a critical exponent should be independent of boundary conditions , this is a(nother ) demonstration that @xmath18 for the @xmath25 model in 2d .    as pointed out earlier@xcite , these results for large @xmath10 do not agree with the scaling law prediction of carter , bray and moore,@xcite due to the special role of zero - energy domain walls . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath12 with our boundary conditions ,",
    "the prediction of carter , bray and moore is @xmath59 this limit has not been studied before for the @xmath25 model . when @xmath18 , @xmath55 should scale as @xmath60 in 2d . for small @xmath10 we may think of the lattice as consisting of @xmath61-sized subsystems stacked in the * y * direction , with @xmath14 being the sum of the dw energies of the subsystems .",
    "therefore , by the central limit theorem , we anticipate that the probability distribution of @xmath14 should approach a gaussian distribution in the limit of small @xmath10 . in the spin - glass region of the phase diagram ,",
    "the center of this limiting gaussian will approach zero as @xmath45 increases .",
    "we will show that our numerical results for the small @xmath10 limit are indeed in good agreement with these expectations , even though the subsystems are not fully independent .",
    "we begin the study of the @xmath32 behavior of the @xmath25 random bond model by studying the gs energy for different concentrations @xmath0 of the antiferromagnetic bonds [ @xmath62 ( ferromagnetic phase ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 and different system sizes @xmath65 for square samples @xmath66 , _ i.e. _ aspect ratio @xmath67 .",

    "the gaussian behavior here is not a finite - size effect either .",

    "then the dominant contribution to non - gaussian behavior will be the kurtosis , which simplifies to @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the @xmath177 moment of @xmath128 , under these conditions .",
    "[ fig.4 ] shows the behavior of the kurtosis of the @xmath128 distributions at @xmath139 as a function of @xmath45 and @xmath10 .",
    "it shows that for @xmath160 the kurtosis is negligible , except when @xmath178 , quantifying the convergence towards a gaussian distribution for small @xmath10 .",

    "( [ eq : fitfull ] ) , now for aspect ratios @xmath179 . in table",
    "i we show the results of the finite - size scaling fits at @xmath180 . according to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ar ] ) , the prediction of ar scaling theory is that the ratio @xmath181 should approach @xmath182 for small @xmath10 .",
    "considering the statistical errors and the corrections to scaling , the agreement is quite satisfactory .",
    "here we observe that for @xmath183 the scaling assumption is reasonably accurate .",

    "hence , we believe that inside the entire sg region the behavior is consistent with the assumptions of the ar approach .      at the end of section ii we argued that for small @xmath10 the system may be thought of as a set of @xmath5 subsystems stacked in the * y * direction .",
    "this implies that the behavior of @xmath14 in this limit should obey eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ar ] ) with @xmath18 .",
    "as we have seen , our numerical results are indeed consistent with this argument .",
    "however , the hand - waving argument does not specify how the subsystems are to be connected to each other . before actually seeing the numerical results",
    ", we were far from confident that this argument would correctly predict what was found .",
    "there is another apparently reasonable argument , which leads one to expect that the results for small @xmath10 should not give this answer . as @xmath12 , we know that the width of the @xmath14 distribution will diverge .",
    "this means that for most of our sample lattices @xmath187 in this limit .",
    "one might have thought , therefore , that the fact that @xmath14 is quantized would no longer matter .",
    "thus one might have guessed that the system would behave in this limit as if @xmath188 , the value for an unquantized distribution .",
    "therefore , our results indicate that a bohr correspondence principle , that in the limit of large quantum numbers the results should be indistinguishable from those of an unquantized system , does not apply .",
    "how can we understand this ?",
    "in our opinion , what we learn from this is that @xmath18 is directly connected to the existence of topological long - range order@xcite at @xmath189 .",
    "one might try to argue that @xmath190 is not small enough , and that for even smaller @xmath10 one would indeed find a crossover to @xmath188 .",
    "such a viewpoint is suggested by the recent work of jrg _",
    "et al._@xcite on the other hand a more detailed analysis@xcite of the low temperature behavior of the specific heat of the @xmath25 model does not support this interpretation .",
    "we have studied the statistics and finite - size scaling behavior of gs and dw energies for the 2d ising random - bond spin glass with an mixture of @xmath21 and @xmath22 bonds , where @xmath0 is the concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds . by using sophisticated matching algorithms",
    ", we can calculate the gs energy and dw energies for quite large systems exactly , which allows us to study the scaling behavior very precisely .",
    "we find that the scaling behavior of the gs energy can be described everywhere inside the sg region by the same simple scaling function eqn .",
    "( [ eq : e0l ] ) , as predicted by ref .. furthermore , when looking at the fluctuations of the gs energy , we find , after carefully taking into account finite - size corrections , that they follow the predicted simple @xmath191-scaling with an amplitude which has a cusp singularity at the ferromagnetic - sg transition @xmath9 .",
    "the singularity is described by an exponent which is close to @xmath192 .",
    "the behavior of the dw energy is characterized close to @xmath9 , by huge finite - size effects .",
    "nevertheless , the results are compatible with a convergence of @xmath193 to a finite plateau value everywhere inside the sg phase .",
    "this convergence can be described , again universally inside the sg phase , by a single exponent @xmath194 , just by taking into account higher - order corrections to scaling .",
    "finally , we have studied @xmath24 rectangular lattices with aspect ratio @xmath10 between 1/32 and 1 .",
    "we have demonstrated by an example that one assumption underlying ar scaling , i.e.  the assumed independence of the dw energies of different blocks , is not strictly valid .",
    "nevertheless , we find that for large lattices the probability distribution of @xmath14 in the sg region of the phase diagram approaches for @xmath195 a gaussian centered at @xmath58 .",
    "hence , in the small @xmath10 limit the behavior obeys the ar scaling predictions of carter , bray and moore.@xcite    rf is grateful to s. l. sondhi , f. d. m. haldane and d. a. huse for helpful discussions , and to princeton university for providing use of facilities .",
