    "bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity@xcite is based on the reduced interaction potential , which couples only electrons with opposite spins and zero total momentum , while the interaction amplitude is taken to be momentum - independent .",
    "it is known for a long time that hamiltonians of this kind are exactly solvable rich1,rich2,gaudin , rich3 .",
    "namely , they lead to richardson equations , which are nonlinear algebraic equations for the set of complex numbers @xmath0(@xmath1 , ... , @xmath2 ) , where @xmath2 is the number of cooper pairs in the system ; the energy of the system is given by the sum of all @xmath3 s .",
    "originally , richardson equations have been derived by solving directly the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , they can be also recovered through an algebraic bethe - ansatz approach @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the system of richardson equations , in general case , is a hard task @xcite .",
    "these equations are now intensively used to study numerically superconducting state in nanosized superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "they are also applied in the nuclear physics , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite    recently , richardson equations have been used@xcite to explore connections between two famous problems : the one - pair problem solved by cooper@xcite and the many - pair bcs theory of superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the essential ingredients of the cooper model are the fermi sea of noninteracting electrons and the layer above their fermi energy , where an attraction between electrons with up and down spins acts .",
    "two additional electrons are placed into this layer .",
    "it is also assumed that the energy density of one - electronic states within this potential layer , which has a width equal to the debye frequency , is constant .",
    "cooper then was able to solve the schrdinger equation for two electrons .",
    "he found that the attraction , no matter how weak , leads to the appearance of the bound state .",
    "cooper model was an important step towards a microscopic understanding of superconductivity .",
    "in contrast , bcs theory of superconductivity considers a many - pair configuration , which includes the potential layer half - filled .",
    "traditional methods to tackle this problem is either to use a variational approach for the wave function@xcite or to apply bogoliubov canonical transformationsbogoliubov . in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , an _",
    "arbitrary _ filling of the potential layer has been considered . obviously ,",
    "by increasing a filling , one can attain a many - particle configuration starting from the one - pair problem .",
    "although such a procedure seems to be unrealistic from the view point of current experimental facilities , it allows one to deeper understand the role of the pauli exclusion principle in cooper - paired states , as well as to analyze a correspondence between the single - pair problem and bcs condensate .",
    "this gedanken experiment can be also considered as a toy model for the density - induced crossover between individual fermionic molecules , which correspond to cooper problem , and strongly overlapping pairs in bcs configuration@xcite .    in order to find the ground state energy for @xmath2 pairs , in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , a new method for the analytical solution of richardson equations in the thermodynamical limit was proposed . rigorously speaking , this method is applicable to the dilute regime of pairs only , since it assumes that all richardson energy - like quantities are close to the single - pair energy found by cooper . by keeping only the lowest relevant correction to this energy , the expression of the ground state energy",
    "was found to read as @xmath4where @xmath5 is the fermi energy of noninteracting electrons ( or a lower cutoff ) , @xmath6 is the potential layer width ( which corresponds to debye frequency in cooper model ) , @xmath7 , @xmath8 being a constant density of energy states and @xmath9 an interaction amplitude .",
    "an analysis of this equation shows that first two terms in its right - hand side ( rhs ) correspond just to the bare kinetic energy increase due to @xmath2 pairs , while the third term gives the condensation energy .",
    "this condensation energy has a quite remarkable structure : it is proportional both to the number of pairs @xmath2 and to the number of empty states @xmath10 in the potential layer .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath11 , the condensation energy per pair is exactly equal to the binding energy of a single pair , found by cooper@xcite .",
    "thus , a pair `` binding energy '' in a many - pair configuration appears to be simply a fraction of the single - pair binding energy , the reduction being _ linear _ in @xmath2 and proportional to the number of occupied states .",
    "although eq .",
    "( 1 ) was derived for the dilute regime of pairs , it is in a full agreement with the mean - field bcs result for the ground state energy ( originally derived for the half - filling configuration ) .",
    "bcs approach has been also applied to the case of arbitrary filling of the potential layer@xcite , this analysis being similar to bcs - like models developed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the result for an arbitrary filling was also shown@xcite to be consistent with eq .",
    "first two terms in the rhs of eq .",
    "( 1 ) must be identified with the normal state energy , as it appears in bcs theory .",
    "the third term is exactly the condensation energy , apart from the fact that in bcs theory it is traditionally written in terms of the gap @xmath12 that masks a link with the single - pair binding energy .",
    "a detailed discussion of these issues can be found in refs .",
    "[ @xcite ] .    in the recent paper",
    "[ @xcite ] , the dilute - regime approach to the solution of richardson equations@xcite has been advanced to take into account the next - order term of the expansion , which is needed in order to get rid of the dilute regime .",
    "it was found that the corresponding contribution to the ground state energy is underextensive , i.e. , negligible in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( 1 ) derived in the dilute regime of pairs is most likely to be universal , which implies that mean - field bcs results are exact in the thermodynamical limit , in agreement with earlier conclusions@xcite . finally ,",
    "very recently the dilute - limit procedure has been extended by taking into account all the terms in the expansion@xcite .",
    "it was concluded@xcite that corrections beyond the dilute - limit result of ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] are indeed underextensive .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to find a ground state energy using richardson equations without utilizing any asymptotic expansions from the single - pair configuration and to address a validity of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( beyond both a mean - field approximation and dilute - limit expansions of richardson equations ) . for that",
    ", we suggest another way to evaluate richardson equations analytically in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "we start with the so - called exact electrostatic mapping : it was noted [ rich3 ] that richardson equations can be obtained from the condition of a stationarity for the `` energy '' of the two - dimensional system of charges , logarithmically interacting with each other , as well as with the homogeneous external electric field . in the present work , we suggest to make one more step and to consider `` probabilities '' to find a system of charges in a certain configuration at the effective temperature , which is just equal to the interaction constant @xmath9 .",
    "this constant goes to zero in the large - sample limit , such that the `` energy '' landscape is very sharp in the vicinity of its stationary points .",
    "the logarithmic character of the particle - particle interaction energy in two dimensions together with our choice for the effective `` temperature '' leads to the rather compact expression of `` probability '' .",
    "note that it has similarities with the square of laughlin wave function appearing in the theory of fractional quantum hall effectlaughlin .",
    "next , we introduce a `` partition function '' and identify the ground state energy of the initial quantum - mechanical system with the logarithmic derivative of this function with respect to the inverse effective temperature .",
    "this `` partition function '' is actually represented by a multidimensional coupled integral .",
    "coupling between integration variables turns out to be similar with that for selberg integrals ( coulomb integrals ) appearing in conformal field theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) , in certain random matrix models ( dyson gas@xcite ) , and in growth problems@xcite . at the same time",
    ", the structure of the integrand for each variable indicates that it can be also classified as the nrlund - rice integral .",
    "a connection between richardson equations and conformal field theory has already been addressed in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , where it was shown that bcs model can be considered as a limiting case of the chern - simons theory .",
    "indeed , it is easily seen that the structure of richardson equations has similarities with the structure of knizhnik - zamolodchikov equations@xcite . at the same time",
    ", chern - simons theory also plays a very important role in the description of the quantum hall effect [ @xcite ] .",
    "that is why there are similarities between the expression of `` probability '' , as introduced in the present paper , and laughlin wave function .",
    "note that conformal field theories attract a lot of attention , since it is assumed that they can provide a unification between quantum mechanics and the theory of gravitation ( anti de sitter / conformal field theory correspondence ) .",
    "in the present paper , we restrict ourselves to the case of a constant energy density of one - electronic states .",
    "we found an efficient way to calculate the `` partition function '' by transforming the integral to the sum of binomial type .",
    "such a transformation is possible due to the nrlund - rice structure of the integrand .",
    "the sum is evaluated using properties of the determinant of the vandermonde matrix , this determinant being responsible for the coupling between summation variables .",
    "we then are able to obtain eq .",
    "( 1 ) and to prove its validity .",
    "we also suggest a `` probabilistic '' qualitative understanding of this result , which is related to the factorizable form of `` probability '' .",
    "we found that the `` probability '' for the system of pairs , feeling each other through the pauli exclusion principle , can be represented as a linear combination of products of `` probabilities '' for single pairs , each pair being in its own environment with the part of the one - electronic levels absent .",
    "these missing levels form two bands in the bottom as well as at the top of the potential layer for each pair , such that the sum of energies of single pairs for each term of a factorized `` probability '' is the same .",
    "another method to evaluate the multidimensional integral , used in the present paper , is to integrate it through the saddle point corresponding to the single pair .",
    "this approach is actually based on a well - known trick used to compute binomial sums by transforming them to nrlund - rice integrals , which can be tackled by a saddle - point method@xcite . in our case",
    ", this procedure appears to be quite similar to the solution of richardson equations in the dilute regime of pairs , as done in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "it gives rise to the expansion of energy density in powers of pairs density .",
    "however , we were unable to perform calculations along this line beyond few initial terms due to the increasing technical complexity of the procedure .",
    "nevertheless , we show that only the first correction to the energy of noninteracting pairs is extensive , while two others are underextensive , this condition being necessary for eq .",
    "( 1 ) to stay valid .",
    "thus , the first method , based on manipulations with binomial sums , turns out to be much more powerful and , moreover , technically simpler .",
    "we believe that the method , suggested in the present paper , is applicable to situations with nonconstant density of energy states , as well as to other integrable pairing hamiltonians , for which electrostatic analogy exists@xcite .",
    "we also note that there already exists a method for the analytical solution of richardson equations in the thermodynamical limit rich3,roman , altshuler .",
    "for the case of constant density of states , this method , up to now , has been applied to half - filled configuration only , for which its results agree with bcs theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was also used for any pair density and for the dispersion of a three - dimensional system .",
    "we here consider arbitrary fillings at constant density of states .",
    "in addition , the method of ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] assumes that energy - like quantities , in the ground state , are organized into a one - dimensional structure in the complex plane .",
    "this assumption is based on the results of numerical solutions of richardson equations@xcite . in this paper , which is purely analytical , we would like to avoid using this assumption , that is why we have constructed another method , which , moreover , is technically simple and provides some additional insights to the physics of cooper pairs .",
    "nevertheless , results of both approaches for the ground state energy do coincide with each other , as well as with results of the mean - field bcs theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "ii , we formulate our problem and we introduce a basis of our `` probabilistic '' approach .    in section iii , we find the ground state energy in a rather simple way , by using a representation of the `` partition function '' through the coupled binomial sum .",
    "we also suggest `` probabilistic '' interpretation of the obtained result .    in section iv , we tackle integral entering the `` partition function '' by integration through a single - pair saddle point and we also establish a connection with the approach of refs .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "we consider a system of fermions with up and down spins .",
    "they attract each other through the usual bcs reduced potential , coupling only fermions with zero total momenta as @xmath13the total hamiltonian reads as @xmath14 , where @xmath15    it is postulated that the potential @xmath16 acts only for the states with kinetic energies @xmath17 and @xmath18 located in the energy shell between @xmath19  and  @xmath20 . in bcs theory , the lower cutoff @xmath5 corresponds to the fermi energy of noninteracting electrons , while @xmath6 is debye frequency .",
    "we also assume a constant density of energy states @xmath8 inside this layer , which is a characteristic feature of a two - dimensional system .",
    "for a three - dimensional system , this is justified , provided that @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the total number of states with up or down spins in the potential layer is @xmath22 , while these states are located equidistantly , such that @xmath23 @xmath24 , where @xmath24 runs over @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , ... , @xmath6 .",

    "these electrons do interact via the potential given by eq .",

    "@xmath31 and @xmath9 @xmath32 , so that the dimensionless interaction constant , defined as @xmath33 @xmath34 , is volume - independent , @xmath35 . the same is valid for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; hence @xmath36 .",
    "the number of cooper pairs scales as @xmath37 ; consequently , filling @xmath38 is volume - independent , @xmath39 .",
    "we treat arbitrary fillings of the potential layer @xmath40 , while the traditional bcs theory deals with the half - filling configuration .",
    "studies of arbitrary fillings help one to reveal an important underlying physics , which is not easy to see when concentrating on the half - filling configuration , which is quite specific .",
    "it was shown by richardson that the hamiltonian , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ bcspot ] ) and ( [ h0 ] ) , is exactly solvable .",
    "the energy of @xmath2 pairs is given by the sum of @xmath2 energy - like complex quantities @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , ... , @xmath2)@xmath41these quantities satisfy the system of @xmath2 coupled nonlinear algebraic equations , called richardson equations .",
    "the equation for @xmath0 reads as@xmath42 where the summation in the first term of the rhs of the above equation is performed for @xmath17 located in the energy interval , where the potential acts .",
    "note that the number of pairs enters to the formalism through the number of equations that is rather unusual .",
    "the case @xmath43 at @xmath29 , corresponds to the one - pair problem solved by cooper .",
    "the fully analytical resolution of richardson equations , in general case , stays an open problem .",

    "free charges repeal each other .",
    "richardson equations are equivalent to the equilibrium condition for the system of @xmath2 free charges .",
    "a key idea of the approach we here suggest is to switch from the `` energy '' of the system of charges to the `` probability '' @xmath55 for this system to be in a certain state at effective `` temperature '' @xmath56 given by the simple condition @xmath57where@xmath58taking into account eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) for @xmath48 , we obtain for @xmath59  a nicely compact expression@xmath60 which has obvious similarities with the square of laughlin wave function at filling 1 , due to the factor @xmath61 .    in principle , it could seem more reasonable to use @xmath44 instead of @xmath62 in the definition of `` probability '' .",
    "indeed , the corresponding function @xmath63 is real - valued and positive , so that by its properties it is closer to a usual distribution function , as compared to @xmath59 .",
    "however , such a function is not meromorphic , so that cauchy theorem is not applicable ; therefore , it is not so useful for the reasons , which will be clarified below .",
    "the important fact is that the effective `` temperature '' @xmath56 goes to zero in the thermodynamical limit as @xmath64 .",
    "this makes @xmath65 extremely large by its absolute value , while the landscape of @xmath55 is very sharp in the vicinity of stationary points of @xmath48 .",
    "hence , it looks attractive to try extracting an information about stationary points of @xmath48  by using integration techniques .",
    "we briefly illustrate this idea .",
    "let @xmath66 be a function of the variable @xmath67 , which has a sharp maximum at @xmath68 .",
    "it is possible to find @xmath69 approximately without solving equation @xmath70 explicitly , but through the integration .",
    "namely , we consider a ratio of integrals @xmath71 with @xmath69 located `` deeply enough '' inside the integration interval .",
    "the dominant contribution to both integrals is provided by a neighborhood of @xmath69 , so that we expect that their ratio is close to @xmath69 . in particular ,",
    "if a second and higher - order derivatives of @xmath66 at @xmath69 are proportional to some large parameter , for example to @xmath30 , then it is easy to show , by performing taylor expansion of @xmath66 around @xmath69 , that the error in the determination of @xmath69 through the above ratio is of the order of @xmath72 .",
    "however , it is easily seen that stationary points do not necessarily correspond to minima of `` energy '' , but they rather give its saddle points , so that equilibrium positions of free charges are not stable .",
    "the easiest way of seeing it is to consider a one - pair problem , for which equilibrium @xmath3 is located on the real axis , as indicated in fig .",
    "1 . the energy of the system @xmath73 ( as well as the real part of @xmath74 ) increases , if we start to move @xmath3 out of equilibrium from the real axis in a perpendicular direction , but it decreases upon motion along the real axis in both directions ( see section iv for more details ) . hence , to apply a saddle - point method , we should use an integration path passing through the stationary point , as shown in fig . 1 by line 1 .",
    "this procedure could be seen as useless from the viewpoint of determination of a saddle point position , since we already need to know it to apply this technique .",
    "however , this is not true , because we use @xmath48 instead of @xmath44 in the definition of the `` probability '' @xmath75 .",

    "however , such a detailed information is not necessary to understand many global properties of the system , so that a thermodynamical description becomes highly efficient .",
    "the major difference with the usual thermodynamics is in the fact that we are dealing with the unstable equilibrium and therefore the `` partition function '' is obtained by integrating only over half of the degrees of freedom and by using a complex - valued `` probability '' .",

    "we introduce creation operators for holes as @xmath239 and @xmath240 with corresponding rules for destruction operators .",
    "these holes should not be confused with holes in the fermi sea of normal electrons , as appear in bcs theory . by using commutation relations for fermionic operators ,",
    "it is rather easy to rewrite the initial hamiltonian in terms of holes as@xmath241the first two terms of the rhs of eq .",

    "thus , we clearly see a duality between electrons and holes : the ground state of @xmath2 pairs is equivalent to the ground state of @xmath249 holes , while the energy of the latter is equal to the energy of @xmath249 pairs , with @xmath5 changed into @xmath250 , plus the kinetic energy of the potential layer completely filled , given by @xmath251 .",
    "this means that we can avoid considering configurations with @xmath126 by switching to holes , cooper pairs in this case being constructed out of them .",
    "moreover , one can directly check that the expression of the ground state energy given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which we are going to prove , satisfies , within underextensive terms , the above duality criterion .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath125 only",
    ". the existence of the duality between electrons and holes in the energy spectrum has already been noted in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , although its origin , at the level of the hamiltonian , stayed unclear .",
    "we focus on @xmath252 and rewrite it through the integration by parts , as has been done for @xmath209 and @xmath215 @xmath253next , we substitute eq .",

    "we then have to proceed with all these `` new '' @xmath278 s to lower the sum of @xmath169 s by 2 at each iteration and finally to bring them either to @xmath219 or to @xmath209 , depending on a parity of @xmath169 . and so on .",
    "of course , this recursive tree - like procedure becomes more and more tedious when @xmath169 is increasing .",
