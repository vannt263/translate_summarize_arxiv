    "it also reflects the fact that time instants can be arranged in a one - dimensional manifold .",
    "in addition to classical mds , our method also identified specificity of the categories belonging to the age bands 20 - 25 , 30 - 40 .",
    "it means , that the adaptive metrics enables to detect even small decline in the disease occurrence .",
    "all the above examples lead to questions regarding the role of the number of categories , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to mention manifolds which evidently can not be mapped onto the plane . in other words",
    ", the intrinsic dimension is too high . as a simple example demonstrating this property may serve the maps of vertices of 6-dimensional hypercube , which are projectable onto 2d only on the expense of very high stress values ( when the categorization absents ) .",

    "interestingly , the occurrence of two local minima ( one deep and one    more shallow ) seems to be a generic feature common to wide class of    data .",
    "the exception is found in the uniform case    @xmath144 , where the dependence on @xmath47 and    @xmath55 simply vanishes .",
    "( iii ) : :    during the initial search phase @xmath90 suddenly    drops . the subsequent adjustment yields gradual refinement of the    double - minima structure .",
    "( iv ) : :    the local , slow convergence with slow detailed search is typical for    the last optimization stage ( in agreement with the optimization model ,    its assumptions and expectations , see the dynamics eq.([eq : hlearn ] ) ) .",
    "( v ) : :    in the most of investigated cases deeper minimum corresponds to    negative @xmath93 .",
    "it means , that our algorithm tends    to interpret inter - category distances as smaller then    @xmath145 ( due to    @xmath146 factor ) .",
    "this can be explained by    the requirement to find sufficiently big area for the projections of    the most of dense data inputs .",
    "interesting question arises whether oscillations of the parameters , such as those which determine @xmath103 , can be replaced by the complex dynamical models .",
    "the promising candidate for the alternative ho optimization part is the chaotic discrete duffing oscillator  @xcite which was used in our numerical experiments .",

    "chaos is often present in the nonlinear systems , thus many another variants of chaotic dynamical systems can be used to improve our mds approach .",
    "our preliminary simulations did not confirm increased efficiency in comparison to the presented harmonic stimulation . to assess the relevance of the chaotic models for the complex optimization ml problem one needs further intensive numerical research that goes far beyond the scope of the present work . in any case",
    ", the application of the idea of self - organization in combination with chaos phenomena may constitute very interesting way to develop further ml studies .",
    "ml plays an important and growing role in exploratory data analysis and machine learning . in the paper we introduced biologically and",
    "physically inspired flexible variant of standard mds , which , as we have shown , is the effective tool for simultaneous mapping and categorization .",
    "our proposal uses the orchestration of three stochastic optimization heuristics .",
    "we demonstrated , that optimization trajectory produces the phase portrait involving two well - separated minima .",
    "this monitoring properly illustrates and , at the same time , justifies the necessity of the more comprehensive and advanced routines in the optimization .",
    "current ml theories are handled in more or less linear framework with too small influence of non - linearity to exploit emergent characteristics .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper ( in comparison with traditional ml theories ) consists in combining reasonable solution of the specific problems with promising non traditional approximate heuristic methods used in the area of the complex systems , statistical physics , optimization science and artificial biology .",
    "although not practical for the applications in which the projections and partitions must be found rapidly , the approach seems to be successful at more detailed analysis of the selected manifolds .",
    "we have shown , that the flexibility of mds can be improved using the adaptive metrics containing categorical independent variables .",
    "overall , surprising results clearly reveal unexpected behavior and delineate the domains where this robust technique can bring valuable results . increased flexibility has to be paid with a larger number of categories .",
    "although the current form of the algorithm enables categorization of the datasets into predefined number of categories , further research is needed to tune the number to match the intrinsic dimension and local structure of manifolds .",
    "the information criteria ( such as bic ) have to be included as well to improve the overall classification performance .",
    "non - equilibrium dynamical systems often show complex adaptive behavior called emergent properties . in the most of the datasets that we studied the emergence of the compact domains of the categories",
    "has been observed .",
    "it should be emphasized that processes , where structural changes of initial disordered configurations / projections yield self - organized structures , significantly differ from the traditional forms of the programming and learning which claim to produce similar effects by using some explicit and user predefined criteria .",
    "a lot of open questions remains to be studied in the proposed computational scheme .",
    "a general open question is whether we should generalize the method to include information about more generic distance functions and more nuanced interpretations and categorizations .",
    "our analysis does not rule out other modified forms of the @xmath155 prefactor of the metrics [ see eq.([eq : hell ] ) ] .",
    "the model we used is flexible enough to admit straightforward extensions .",
    "for example , the prefactor @xmath156 @xmath157 may be used which violate the original symmetry of @xmath45 ( i.e. symmetry between an object @xmath55 and its mirror @xmath158 ) by adding , e.g. , the term @xmath159 that prevent from the occurrence of non - uniqueness and degeneracy .",
    "our analysis leads to interesting application of the hysteretic optimization method which has relevance in modeling and adjusting of systems with global impact parameters .",
    "we have shown that the examples can be found in ml situations where high intrinsic dimension of manifold favors the charting of data during the projection process .",
    "in particular , we believe that our numerical experimentation might be instructive in the construction of the models of the collective behavior including features such as emergence and organization , which are topics of much interest in the current research .",

    "<S> classical metric and non - metric multidimensional scaling ( mds ) variants are widely known manifold learning ( ml ) methods which enable construction of low dimensional representation ( projections ) of high dimensional data inputs . </S>",
    "<S> however , their use is crucially limited to the cases when data are inherently reducible to low dimensionality . in general , drawbacks and limitations of these , as well as pure </S>",
    "<S> , mds variants become more apparent when the exploration ( learning ) is exposed to the structured data of high intrinsic dimension . </S>",
    "<S> as we demonstrate on artificial and real - world datasets , the over - determination problem can be solved by means of the hybrid and multi - component discrete - continuous multi - modal optimization heuristics . </S>",
    "<S> its remarkable feature is , that projections onto 2d are constructed simultaneously with the data categorization ( classification ) compensating in part for the loss of original input information . </S>",
    "<S> we observed , that the optimization module integrated with ml modeling , metric learning and categorization leads to a nontrivial mechanism resulting in generation of patterns of categorical variables which can be interpreted as a heuristic charting . </S>",
    "<S> the method provides visual information in the form of non - convex clusters or separated regions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ability to categorize the surfaces into back and front parts of the analyzed 3d data objects have been attained through self - organized structuring without supervising .    </S>",
    "<S> manifold learning ( ml )  @xcite is a technical term for a group of techniques developed to reduce dimensionality of high - dimensional data , facilitating their eventual visualization , evaluating and understanding at intuitive level . </S>",
    "<S> the ml approach usually serves as a preprocessing step in familiarizing with data and for the formulation of hypotheses leading to further data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it has found many important applications in biology , robotics or visual data mining . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> the ml techniques have also found applications in the physics of deterministic chaos  @xcite , as well as techniques for extracting structural information from x - ray diffraction snapshots  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> projection from a higher to lower dimension is not straightforward and must meet the ultimate requirement of capturing the essence or patterns of information content of high dimensional datasets . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the ml methods differ markedly in the kind of the original information they are required to preserve during the transformation . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the basic classification of ml methods into local and global should be mentioned .    </S>",
    "<S> the representative of the global methods are well known _ principal component analysis _  </S>",
    "<S> ( pca )  @xcite or classical mds @xcite _ non - linear _ _ multidimensional _ _ scaling _  ( mds )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach , mds , is studied and extended in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> both the mds variants , non - metric as well as metric , are formulated as stress minimization problems where the stress is defined in the terms of differences between pairwise dissimilarities of data points and distances of assigned projected coordinates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many methods have been developed that incorporate the conservation of the quantities such as distances and generalized distances . in situations where the topological concepts offer more feasible projections , </S>",
    "<S> pure euclidean description is abandoned in favor of more flexible geometries . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the method isomap  @xcite uses geodesic instead of euclidean distances and can be thus preferentially applied to nonlinear manifolds .    </S>",
    "<S> elementary ml methods face serious difficulties when confronted with noisy  @xcite or intrinsically irreducible high - dimensional datasets . in such cases , </S>",
    "<S> projection composed of approximate local isometrics is usually constructed . in many real - world applications , </S>",
    "<S> one often tackles general manifolds , where the domain decomposition and segmentation problems often occur . </S>",
    "<S> these are typical for the closed manifolds , intersecting circles , sphere surfaces or non - orientable surfaces such as mbius strip or klein bagel , which are analyzed later in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the ml segmentation tasks producing non - overlapping domain decomposition are also known as identifications of _ charts _ and _ atlases _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decomposition is np hard local categorical assignment , which occurs in the graph coloring or graph partitioning problems .    until now </S>",
    "<S> , many alternative interdisciplinary approaches based on different principles have been developed to deal with the ml data preprocessing . </S>",
    "<S> the famous _ stress _ _ function _ _ concept _ has been first introduced by kruskal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the scientists  @xcite are turning their attention to new ideas and methods derived from the connection of ml with mathematical and physical modeling or nature - inspired optimization sciences  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as an example may serve physically inspired ml method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another method called _ elastic _ _ map _ exploits the mechanical analogy with the system of the elastic springs . </S>",
    "<S> the concept called _ diffusion map _  @xcite introduces diffusion distance less susceptible to the noise compared to euclidean measures . the approach _ relational _ _ perspective map _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite consists in using parallels between mutual relations of data items and the behavior of the positions of the charged particles , which are repelling each other but are simultaneously confined to toroidal surface . </S>",
    "<S> several new approaches to perform ml  @xcite including kernel regression  @xcite take inspiration from the evolutionary general - purpose heuristics and genetic algorithms . in  @xcite the class of the models based on the generalized b - c energy ( stress ) functions  @xcite which has its origins in the optimization approach of sammon  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> rapidly increasing computer power allows to tackle ml problems in previously unexpected ways . </S>",
    "<S> further progress in the ml and mds techniques can be made by applying simple , but computationally demanding _ optimization - based _ _ </S>",
    "<S> approaches_. in this respect , we propose the variant of data adaptive metrics aimed to provide combined description in the terms of continuous / quantitative and categorical variables . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous use of discrete ( categorical ) and continuous variables needs heuristics - based optimization to avoid getting stuck in the local optima . </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated in the below presented simulation examples , the advanced hybrid construction enables to adapt the distance metrics simultaneously with the categorical classification and adjustment of the continuous projected coordinates .    </S>",
    "<S> the ml process may be also viewed as a kind of stochastic optimization which is inspired by the imitation of natural systems . </S>",
    "<S> designers of optimization techniques usually imply biologically - inspired concepts  @xcite to discover suitable rules  @xcite . on the other hand , many heuristics - based optimization methods benefit from the analogies between the optimization dynamics and physical processes as well  @xcite .    in the paper we present computational results of heuristic simulation mds technique . </S>",
    "<S> we assume , that the combination of a few existing optimization approaches may provide better results than the only method . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic optimization method we applied combines the advantages of _ grid _ search  ( gs )  @xcite , _ extremal _ optimization  ( eo ) @xcite , and _ </S>",
    "<S> hysteretic optimization _  </S>",
    "<S> ( ho )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated below , dynamical behavior of the above combination produces very interesting behavior . in the next we give a brief description of the respective methods and their benefits .    </S>",
    "<S> gs is the standard way of performing exhaustive optimization in the hyperparameter space . </S>",
    "<S> but this strategy does not scale well for large problems . </S>",
    "<S> gs is an efficient in a one - dimensional or two - dimensional domains since the problems at higher dimensions occur due to `` the curse of dimensionality '' .    the problem of getting stuck in local optimum is partially solved by incorporating eo method , inspired by the stylized model of coevolutionary process proposed by bak and sneppen  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since then , many authors have extended the method ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) and applied it in many contexts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the essence of the method consists in the identification of the low - quality components and their subsequent elimination . </S>",
    "<S> the method exploits highly nonlinear mechanism of the large fluctuations - avalanches , known to be efficient in the exploration of many local optima and overcoming of the barriers in the search space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty with the eo applications is , that its implementation necessitates specific definition of the local fitness ( scoring , objective ) function .    </S>",
    "<S> ho method  @xcite is inspired by the mechanism of the global reordering during the demagnetization of magnetic samples due to damped alternating magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the method can be formulated more abstractly and adapted to non - magnetic problems as well . </S>",
    "<S> the ho method provided successful outcomes in the case of the benchmark _ traveling _ _ salesman _ _ problem _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we justify the below presented ml application of the ho type technique by the fact , that suggested type of distance metrics involves global parameter with system - wide impact which can be roughly regarded as analogous to the intensity of external magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in the section  [ sec : mod ] </S>",
    "<S> we describe the formulation of mds with the use of the adaptive metrics . in section [ sec : optim ] we discuss the optimization strategies appropriate for given purpose . </S>",
    "<S> the datasets and corresponding numerical results illustrating our approach are described in sec.[sec : numerical ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the conclusions are presented . </S>"
