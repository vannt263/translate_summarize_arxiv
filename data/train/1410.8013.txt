    "_ the whole is greater than the sum of its parts  _ , mused aristotle to his disciples , written down in his _ metaphysics _",
    "350 b.c.e , when he wondered whether there are additional substances besides fire , earth , water , and air , that make up our universe .",
    "his disciples may be intrigued about the mathematical paradoxon .",
    "exploring the global energetics of solar flares and associated eruptive phenomena , we also wonder whether we can measure all components of the energy output , partitioned by secondary processes , and whether the sum of their parts matches the whole of the energy input . in a nutshell ,",
    "our concept or working hypothesis is that all primary energy input is provided by dissipation of magnetic energies , which supply the energy output of secondary processes , such as the thermal energies of the heated flare plasma , the nonthermal energies of accelerated particles that produce hard x - rays , gamma - rays , or are detected as _ solar energetic particles ( sep ) _ , and kinetic energies of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . regardless",
    "whether this hypothesis is true or false , obtaining quantitative statistics of the different forms of energies will be extremely useful for a host of reasons : ( i ) do the known forms of energy add up or do we miss important parts ( similar to the dark matter problem of the universe ) ; ( ii ) do we have sufficient magnetic energy to supply all secondary processes , or are our magnetic reconnection models insufficient ; or ( iii ) what is the cause and consequence , the efficiency and upper limits of various energy conversion processes ? essentially , every theoretical solar flare or cme model can be tested , evaluated , and disproved by energetic considerations .",
    "the global energetics of solar flares and their energy partition has been systematically addressed in some earlier studies , in two papers on the energy partition of two solar flare / cme events ( emslie et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) , and in one on the global energetics of 38 large solar eruptive events ( emslie et al .",
    "although these papers study various contents of energy , such as ( i ) the radiated energy in soft x - rays detected by goes , ( ii ) the total energy radiated in soft x - rays , ( iii ) the peak energy in soft x - rays , ( iv ) the bolometric radiated energy , ( v ) the non - thermal energy in accelerated @xmath1820 kev electrons , ( vi ) in @xmath181 mev ions , ( vii ) the kinetic energies in cmes , and ( viii ) in solar energetic particles ( sep ) in interplanetary space , no measurement of the amount of available free magnetic energy that drives all these energy conversion processes was attempted . instead , the simple ( non - dissipative ) magnetic potential field was calculated , and an ad hoc value of 30% was used to estimate the free magnetic energy . in the meantime",
    ", various _ nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) _ codes have been developed that are able to calculate the free magnetic energy directly , either using information from vector magnetic field measurements ( e.g. , metcalf et al .",
    "1995 , 2005 ; bobra et al .  2008",
    "; jiao et al .  1997 ; guo et al .  2008 ; schrijver et al .  2008 ;",
    "thalmann et al .  2008 , 2013 ) , or employing tools that take advantage of the geometry of coronal loops , which supposedly trace out the `` true '' coronal magnetic field ( aschwanden 2013a , b , c ; aschwanden and malanushenko 2013 ; malanushenko et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "thus , the new capabilities of calculating free magnetic energies as well as their decreases during flares with high - quality hmi / sdo data , represent one important justification to investigate the global energetics of solar flares now .",
    "another important reason is the unprecedented euv and soft x - ray imaging capabilities of aia / sdo , which copiously display the twisted , sigmoid - like , and helical geometry of coronal loops that define the non - potential magnetic field .",
    "in addition , the euv images provide spatial information ( length scales , areas , and volumes of flares ) which is a prerequiste to calculate the volume - integrated thermal energies in flares .",
    "moreover , the euv images from aia / sdo and euvi / stereo yield also detailed information on euv dimming during the launch of a cme ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2009b ) , and thus allow us to determine masses , velocities , and kinetic energies of cmes at any location on the solar disk , while the traditional measurements of cme masses using the polarized brightness of white - light images ( e.g. , vourlidas et al .",
    "2010 ) are only feasible near the solar limb .",
    "this first paper of a series on the global energetics of solar flares is dealing with magnetic energies .",
    "further studies will include thermal energies , non - thermal energies , kinetic energies of cmes , a comparative synthesis of the global energetics , and the application of the fractal - diffusive self - organized criticality model .",
    "the organization of this first paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a brief description of the two used magnetic calculation methods , the phot - nlfff and the cor - nlfff codes , while more details about the cor - nlfff code , especially the recent improvements , are described in the appendices a ( automated tracing of coronal loops ) , b ( potential field parameterization ) , c ( rotational invariance of magnetic field ) , and d ( forward - fitting of non - potential fields ) . in section 3",
    "we present the observations and statistical results , based on the data analysis of a comprehensive dataset that includes all m- and x - class flares observed with the sdo during the first 3.5 years of the mission .",
    "the results include measurements of the free energy and their uncertainties , their time evolution , their timing , comparisons between the two codes , scaling laws , geometric measurements , size distributions , and the poynting flux . in the discussion in section 4",
    "we address aspects of measuring the coronal magnetic field , the illumination effects that cause an apparent increase of free energies , a self - organized criticality model , previous measurements of flare - dissipated energies , scaling laws of magnetic energy dissipation , and aspects relevant to the coronal heating problem .",
    "we summarize the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this study we deal with two fundamentally different methods to calculate magnetic energies of active regions during solar flare events , which differ in their ( photospheric versus coronal ) origin of the observables .",
    "photospheric codes calculate nonlinear force - free fields ( phot - nlfff ) based on an extrapolation of the photospheric 3d magnetic field vectors @xmath19 $ ] ( section 2.1 ) , while the alternative method ( cor - nlfff ) calculates coronal nonlinear force - free fields by fitting a force - free field model to coronal loop geometries @xmath20 $ ] , which are obtained by an automated feature detection method applied to multi - wavelength euv images , as well as using the line - of - sight component @xmath21 from a simultaneously observed magnetogram ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "we use the photospheric vector magnetograms from the hmi onboard sdo ( scherrer et al .",
    "2012 ; hoeksema et al .  2014 ) as the boundary condition for the photospheric non - linear forcefree field extrapolation method ( phot - nlfff ) .",
    "since the photosphere is not forcefree ( metcalf et al .  1995 ) , while the corona is generally close to forcefree , a pre - processing technique is used to make the photospheric boundary near - forcefree before extrapolation with the 3d nlfff code ( wiegelmann et al .  2006 , 2008 ;",
    "wheatland and regnier 2009 ) . for the pre - processing",
    "we use the weighted optimization method of wiegelmann ( 2004 ) , which is an implementation of the original work of wheatland et al .",
    "the extrapolations were performed using non - uniformly rebinned magnetograms ( approximately with a scale of 2 pixels @xmath22 ) within a computational domain of @xmath23 ( sometimes @xmath24 ) uniform grid points , corresponding to @xmath25 mm@xmath26 , or @xmath27 mm@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "since the wiegelmann code requires a planar boundary perpendicular to the line - of - sight , the vector magnetograms are de - rotated to the disk center and remapped using the lambert ( cylindrical ) equal - area projection ( see also sun et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .    the nlfff extrapolation yields a 3d field @xmath28 $ ] in each voxel of the 3d cube .",
    "the free magnetic energy @xmath29 quantifies the energy deviation of the coronal magnetic non - linear forcefree field @xmath30 from its potential field state @xmath31 , which is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the volume of the computational domain from the photosphere to the corona , and the subscripts @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the nlfff and the potential field , respectively .",
    "more details about the calculation of free magnetic energy with the nlfff code used here are given in jing et al .",
    ".    for the present study we calculated phot - nlfff solutions at a single time near the flare peak for 56 ( out of the possible 172 ) flare events with @xmath18m1.0 goes class , all at locations within @xmath36 heliographic longitude difference to the central meridian . for the subset of the 11 largest events ( of @xmath18x1.0",
    "goes class ) we calculated a time series of free energies with a cadence of 12 minutes .",
    "the calculation of a nonpotential field solution in a 3d computation box for a single time frame requires about @xmath37 hours computation time .",
    "an alternative method is the so - called _ coronal nonlinear force - free field ( cor - nlfff ) _ code , which we are using for the computation of nonpotential fields by employing coronal constraints .",
    "this novel method uses a line - of - sight magnetogram to define a potential field solution , and applies forward - fitting of a parameterized nlfff model ( in terms of vertical currents ) to the geometry of observed coronal loops , which supposedly trace out the true coronal magnetic field .",
    "the chief advantage of this alternative model is that the nlfff solution is not affected by the non - forcefreeness of the photosphere and lower chromosphere ( because it does not use the transverse photospheric magnetic field vectors in the extrapolation of a nlfff solution , as the standard phot - nlfff codes do ) , and that the obtained nlfff solution matches closely the geometry of the observed coronal loops ( while standard phot - nlfff codes have no capability to fit the coronal loop geometry ) .",
    "moreover , the cor - nlfff code is orders of magnitude faster than traditional phot - nlfff codes , because the cor - nlfff model ( in terms of vertical currents ) represents an analytical nlfff approximation ( force - free to second order in the force - free @xmath38-parameter ) that can be forward - fitted fast and efficiently .",
    "the forward - fitting of a cor - nlfff solution for a single time frame is accomplished typically in @xmath39 min , which is about 2 - 3 orders of magnitude faster than with a phot - nlfff code .",
    "previous studies using this cor - nlfff code include the analytical derivation of a nlfff solution in terms of vertical currents ( aschwanden 2013a ) , the numerical prototype code and tests with simulated data ( aschwanden and malanushenko 2013 ) , calculations of the free energy ( aschwanden 2013b ) , potential - field calculations of active regions ( aschwanden and sandman 2010 ) , nonpotential - field calculations of active regions using stereoscopic data ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2012a ) , nonpotential forward - fitting with and without stereoscopic data ( aschwanden 2013c ) , and comparisons of phot - nlfff and cor - nlfff solutions for the 2011 february 12 - 17 flares ( aschwanden , sun , and liu 2014a ) .",
    "the cor - nlfff code has been continuously developed over the last years , leading to substantial new improvements that are briefly described in the appendices a , b , c , and d. the cor - nlfff code consists of three principal parts : ( i ) the automated tracing of coronal loops in euv images ( appendix a ) , the potential - field parameterization ( appendix b ) , which is shown to be invariant to the solar rotation ( appendix c ) , and the forward - fitting of nonpotential fields ( appendix d ) .",
    "for the calculation of the free energy @xmath29 we use the same definition as given for phot - nlfff codes ( eq .  1 ) , except that we correct for isotropic twist directions . since the analytical nonpotential field approximation includes only magnetically twisted field lines wound around vertical twist axes , the obtained free energy @xmath40 is a lower limit to the total free energy @xmath41 . in order to obtain a first - order correction",
    ", we consider a current along a semi - circular loop or filament , which has a cosine - dependence along the loop and can be statistically included by introducing an _ isotropic twist correction factor _",
    "@xmath42 ( aschwanden , sun , and liu 2014a ) , @xmath43 thus we expect that the corrected free energy is about a factor of @xmath42 higher than the best - fit values of the vertical - current free energies @xmath44 .",
    "the dataset we are analyzing for this project on the global energetics of flares includes all m- and x - class flares observed with the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) _",
    "( pesnell et al .  2011 ) during the first 3.5 years of the mission ( 2010 june 1 to 2014 jan 31 ) , which amounts to 399 flare events .",
    "the catalog of these flare events is available online , see _ http://www.lmsal.com/@xmath45aschwand / rhessi / flare@xmath46energetics.html_. magnetic energies are determined for events that have a heliographic longitude of @xmath47 ( 177 events ) , of which 5 events contained incomplete or corrupted aia data , so that we are left with 172 events suitable for magnetic data analysis . using the cor - nlfff code we calculate the evolution of free ( magnetic ) energies for all of these 172 events , while a subset of 57 events is subjected to the ( computationally more expensive ) phot - nlfff code also .    the analyzed sdo data set includes euv images observed with the _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) _ ( lemen et al .  2012 ;",
    "boerner et al .  2012 ) , as well as magnetograms from the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) _ ( scherrer et al .  2012 ) .",
    "the sdo started observations on 29 march 2010 and has produced essentially continuous data of the full sun since then .",
    "aia provides euv images from four @xmath48 detectors with a pixel size of @xmath49 , corresponding to an effective spatial resolution of @xmath50 .",
    "aia contains ten different wavelength channels , three in white light and uv , and seven euv channels , whereof six wavelengths ( 94 , 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 ) are centered on strong iron lines ( fe viii , ix , xii , xiv , xvi , xviii ) , covering the coronal range from @xmath51 mk to @xmath52 mk .",
    "aia records a full set of near - simultaneous images in each temperature filter with a fixed cadence of 12 seconds .",

    "the hmi magnetograms are recorded with a @xmath48 pixel camera with a pixel size of @xmath53 , giving an overall cadence of 45 s for the doppler velocity , intensity , and los magnetic field measurements , which have been processed from 135 s time intervals .",
    "an example of a forward - fitting solution for one instant of time during the evolution of a solar flare is given in fig .  1 , which shows ar 11158 at heliographic position s21n12 observed on 2011 february 15 , 01:14 ut , shortly before the goes - class x2.2 flare . the theoretical field lines of the best forward - fit nonpotential field model ( red curves in fig .",
    "1 ) are overlaid on the tracings of observed loops ( yellow curves in fig .  1 ) , calculated at the intersection at the midpoints of each observed loop segment . the observed magnetogram and the model with the decomposed magnetic charges are shown in fig",
    "the control parameters of the cor - nlfff code are listed on the right side of fig .  1 , where also a histogram of the misalignment angles of all loops is shown , with a median of @xmath54 .",
    "from the 6 aia wavelength images , a total of 508 loop structures were automatically detected , of which only 300 loops were used for forward - fitting , while a large number ( 188 ) of structures with a ripple ratio of @xmath55 have been discarded ( which mostly contain `` moss''-contaminted structures , see appendix a ) .",
    "the key results of this run are the median misalignment angle of @xmath54 ( which expresses the goodness - of - fit ) , the total potential energy of the active region , @xmath56 erg , the free energy , @xmath57 erg , which yields a ratio of @xmath58 , or a free energy that is 10.6% of the potential energy .      in fig .",
    "2 we show the time evolution of the magnetic free energy @xmath59 , the soft x - ray goes 1 - 8  flux profile @xmath60 , the misalignment angles @xmath61 , and the number of detected @xmath62 and fitted loops @xmath63 . for all cases in our analysis",
    "we compute a time series with a length that covers the flare duration plus a half hour margin before and after the flare , with a cadence of 0.1 hours ( 6 min ) , yielding about 12 - 40 time frames per flare . for event # 12 shown in figs .  1 and 2 , we need 13 time intervals ( with a step of @xmath64 hr ) to cover the time series",
    ".    in order to quantify an error of the measurement of free energies we vary most of the control parameters and find that the final result of the free energy is somewhat sensitive to the loop selection criterion @xmath65 ( appendix a )",
    ". therefore we perform the forward - fitting with 3 different sets of loop selection parameters : @xmath66 ( run1 ; fig .",
    "2 left ) , @xmath67 ( run2 ; fig .",
    "2 middle ) , and @xmath68 ( run3 ; fig .  2 right ) .",
    "this `` ripple criterion '' ( eq .",
    "a2 ) discriminates between smooth loop flux profiles ( @xmath69 ) and highly fluctuating loop flux profiles ( @xmath70 ) that are most likely containing `` moss structures '' rather than loops , or a combination of both ( see fig .  18 for examples of `` moss - like '' structures ) .",
    "a low value of the ripple criterion has the advantage of selecting only `` good loop structures '' , but has the disadvantage that the number of selected loops is low , which may not be sufficient in some cases to constrain the nonpotential energy near some magnetic sources ( see low ratio of fitted to detected loops in fig .  2 ( bottom left panel ) .",
    "a high value , on the other side , contains more `` false ( moss ) structures '' , but provides more statistics that enables `` good '' forward - fitting solutions ( see large ratio of fitted to detected loop structures in fig .  2 : bottom right panel ) .",
    "therefore , the optimum is somewhere inbetween ( say around @xmath71 ) . however , as the values shown in fig .  2 demonstrate ( see error bars in fig .  2 , top panel ) , the results of the free energy @xmath59 are fairly robust for different loop selection parameters ( @xmath72 ) , and thus we use the mean and standard deviation of these multiple ( selection - dependent ) solutions for error estimates of the free energy , @xmath73 .",
    "we average the results from all the 3 trial runs ( run1 , run2 , run3 ) and obtain a mean @xmath59 and standard deviation @xmath74 of the free energy .",
    "the uncertainty or error @xmath75 of the mean value of the free energy ( for each time frame @xmath76 ) is according to standard statistics ( bevington and robinson 1992 ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 for our 3 trial runs with different loop selection criteria .",
    "the evolutionary time profiles shown in fig .  2 reveal a number of interesting features of the cor - nlfff code .",
    "the most instructive property is that the free energy @xmath59 systematically drops before the flare start time , for any chosen loop detection criterion ( see error bars in fig .  2 , top , which are obtained from the scatter of the three runs ) , in contrast to the goes flux that increases slowly in the preflare phase and then grows rapidly during the flare rise time ( fig .  2 , second row )",
    ". the drop in free energy is accompanied by a decrease of the nonlinear force - free parameter @xmath79 for some of the strongest magnetic sources @xmath80 , such as for the magnetic charges @xmath810,1,2 , and 3 ( fig .  2 , third row ) .",
    "the misalignment angle varies in the range of @xmath82 for the selection of smooth loops ( @xmath83 ) , while the misalignment is larger @xmath84 for the selection of loops with a higher ripple ratio @xmath85 ( fig .  2 , fourth row ) , because of a higher contamination of `` false loops '' or moss features .",
    "the largest misalignment occurs around the flare peak time , when image saturation , pixel bleeding , and diffraction patterns occur and produce `` false loop structures '' that are difficult to completely remove ( see details in appendix a and fig .",
    "18 ) .",
    "naively , we expect that the free energy @xmath59 in a flaring active region has a near - constant value before a flare ( because build - up or storage of nonpotential magnetic energy is slow compared with the rise time of a flare ) , which then decreases monotonically during the flare time interval , dropping to a lower level after the flare .",
    "we will see that this `` single - step decrease '' behavior is sometimes observed in the free energy when computed from photospheric field extrapolations ( with phot - nlfff codes ) , but the measurements of the free energy based on coronal loops ( using cor - nlfff codes ) exhibit a more complex behavior that involves both apparent increases and decreases of the free energy before and during flare time intervals ( aschwanden , sun , and liu 2014a ) . the key aspect to understand this complex behavior",
    "is based on the fact that not all twisted and current - carrying loop structures are illuminated before the flare , and thus part of the free energy is invisible before the flare . once the flare starts , chromospheric evaporation gradually fills up more and more helically twisted loops until all or most twisted loop structures are `` illuminated '' and the full amount of free energy becomes detectable . at the same time , some free magnetic energy becomes dissipated during the flare , which is manifested by decreases of the free energy .",
    "thus , essentially we can interpret the increases of free energy after flare start as temporary `` coronal illumination '' effects , while decreases can be interpreted as episodes of `` magnetic energy dissipation '' .",
    "in simple flares we expect then to observe one single increase of the free energy at flare start , followed by a single decrease during the flare rise time . in more complex flares ,",
    "multiple phases of illuminations and dissipations follow each other sequentially . the simplest method to measure",
    "the total amount of dissipated energy is then just to ignore the increases due to illumination effects and to sum up all energy decreases during the flare time interval .",
    "the principle of this method is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 for two subsequent illumination and dissipation phases .",
    "the total amount of dissipated free energy is @xmath86 in this example",
    ".    one might wonder whether the time intervals with decreases in the free energy could be interpreted as an inverse illumination effect , namely a disappearance of twisted flare loops by cooling , moving a detected loop eventually out of the observed wavelength passband and making it invisible again .",
    "this ambiguity , however , can entirely be ruled out during the risetime of soft x - ray or euv light curves , because the rise time indicates a phase of increasing flux , emission measure , and electron density of the flaring structures , and thus would contradict an interpretation in terms of cooling - related flux decrease .",
    "based on the foregoing discussion we need to deconvolve the time evolution of energy dissipation ( which manifests as a temporary decrease of free energy ) from the illumination effects ( which is indicated by a temporary increase of free energy ) . in order to achieve such a deconvolution",
    "we ignore the time steps with increasing energy and derive a time profile @xmath87 that includes only the negative energy decreases @xmath88 , which is shown in fig",
    ".  4 ( second panel ) , as derived from the free energy time profile @xmath59 of an observed flare ( fig .  4 , top panel ) , observed with sdo on 2012-mar-07 , 00:02 ut ( event # 147 ) , being the largest flare of our analyzed dataset .",
    "this monotonously decreasing time profile @xmath87 mimics the free energy time profile that would be observed under ideal circumstances when all nonpotential loops would be illuminated in a coronal image ( i.e. , without illumination effects ) .    the time profile of the dissipated energy @xmath89 ( fig .  4 , third panel ) can then be defined as a positive energy by subtracting this monotonically decreasing energy time profile from its maximum value at the start time @xmath90 , @xmath91 or alternatively we can derive it directly from the free energy profile @xmath59 by adding the negative decreases as positive increments , ignoring the positive increases , @xmath92 > 0 \\right ) \\ .\\ ] ]    in addition we define the magnetic energy dissipation rate @xmath93 , which is the time derivative of the dissipated energy @xmath89 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the time step of the time profile , which is @xmath64 hr in our case . this energy dissipation rate is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( fourth panel , red - hatched curve ) and coincides closely with the time derivative of the goes 1 - 8  time profile , @xmath96 ( fig .  4 , fifth panel , blue - hatched curve ) , which is a good proxy for the time profile of hard x - ray emission , particle acceleration , and the chromospheric thick - target heating rate in solar flares ( dennis and zarro 1993 ; brown 1972 ) .",
    "note that the two time profiles of energy dissipation are determined from absolutely independent parameters : the magnetic energy dissipation rate @xmath97 is entirely inferred from the geometry of untwisting coronal loops , while the goes time derivative is derived from the soft x - ray brightness of flare loops .",
    "the example shown in fig .",
    "4 contains also error bars for each evolutionary parameter at each time step , which we calculate based on the uncertainties of the free energies @xmath98 obtained from multiple runs with different loop selections ( section 3.3 ) , and using monte - carlo simulations that propagate the errors using the definitions of the evolutionary time profiles given in eqs .",
    "4 - 6 ) .      in the following we investigate the relative timing of the magnetic energy dissipation rate @xmath99 with respect to the flare peak time of the goes soft x - ray flux .",
    "a representative subset of 60 examples out of the 172 analyzed @xmath18m1.0 goes - class flare events are shown in figs .  5 to 8",
    ", in order of increasing complexity .",
    "for each case we show the temporal evolution of the ( best - fit ) magnetic free energy @xmath98 and energy dissipation rate @xmath93 , along with the goes 1 - 8  light curve that defines the flare start and end time ( by noaa convention ) , as well as its time derivative @xmath100 , which is a good proxy of the hard x - ray flux , the nonthermal emission , rate of particle acceleration , and rate of chromospheric heating .    in a first group ( fig .  5 )",
    "we show 12 examples with flare events where magnetic energy dissipation starts already before the goes - defined flare start . in some cases we see flare precursors in the goes time profile and its time derivative , which may indicate an early trigger of magnetic energy dissipation .",
    "note , however , that the free energy is generally not constant before the flare , but rather increases before flare start , probably thanks to an illumination effect of soft x - ray loops by gentle evaporation during the preflare phase .    in a second group ( fig .",
    "6 ) we show classic examples where the magnetic energy dissipation coincides with the flare rise time of the soft x - ray ( goes ) light curve .",
    "this timing corresponds to our physical intuition that the major energy release phase of a flare occurs during the rise time , when nonthermal particles are accelerated that heat the chromosphere at the flare loop footpoints and drive chromospheric evaporation according to the thick - target model ( brown 1972 ) , which is manifested as a steady increase of the soft x - ray flux .",
    "this scenario predicts a correlation between the soft x - ray flux increase and the magnetic energy decrease , which is indeed clearly fulfilled in the observed cases shown in fig .",
    "6 .    in a third group ( fig",
    ".  7 ) we show examples where the peak of the magnetic energy dissipation does occur slightly after the soft x - ray flare peak , with continuing but decreasing energy dissipation in the flare decay phase . this behavior could be explained by strongly driven chromospheric evaporation during the flare peak time , which drives the illumination of twisted and soft x - ray emitting flare loops with a higher emission increase rate than the magnetic dissipation rate .",
    "since the two effects of illumination and dissipation are competing , it is no surprise that either one can be dominating during particular time phases .    in a fourth group ( fig .",
    "8) we show cases with double flares ( although classified as a single event by noaa ) , which are clearly accompanied with two - step magnetic energy dissipation phases . in these cases",
    "we can resolve two flare loop illumination phases with two subsequent magnetic energy dissipation phases , exactly as sketched in the cartoon of fig .",
    "3 .    in a fifth group ( fig .",
    "9 ) we show cases of complex flares , which consequently have multi - step energy dissipation phases as a consequence .",
    "these cases correspond to long - duration flares , which typically last a few hours ( say 1 - 4 hrs ) .",
    "these events were classified as single flares according to the noaa definition , but both the soft x - ray time profile as well as the time derivative ( i.e. , the hard x - ray proxy ) show multiple peaks that could possible be considered as multiple flares .",
    "nevertheless , because these events last significantly longer and have many different soft x - ray and hard x - ray emission peaks , it is natural that the free energy dissipation rate reveals multiple phases also , which often exhibit a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "note that the evolution of the magnetic energy does not exhibit a monotonously dropping staircase as a function of time , but rather an alternating sequence of ( illumination ) increases and ( dissipation ) decreases .      for a subset of 57 flare events we calculated the potential , nonpotential , and free energy with the phot - nlfff code for one single time frame .",
    "we compare these magnetic energies with the cor - nlfff code in form of scatterplots as shown in fig .",

    "but it is unknown to what extent the pre - processing technique of the phot - nlfff code , or the deprojection of the magnetogram in the phot - nlfff code plays a role in the obtained absolute magnetic field strengths . on the other side , a factor of @xmath104 has been applied to the cor - nlfff code to correct for isotropic twist directions , which indeed improves the agreement between the two codes , since the free energy would otherwise be a factor of 0.32/2.5=0.13 too low compared with the photospheric code .",
    "we suspect that the slightly different spatial resolution ( 2-pixel rebinning for the phot - nlfff code versus 3-pixel rebinning for the cor - nlfff code ) or unresolved twisted magnetic structures could explain the slight underestimate of the free energy .    for the subset of all ( 11 )",

    "it has often been stated that we have no direct method to measure the coronal magnetic field , except for some special methods that can infer the magnetic field at particular locations only , such as in some layers above sunspots by means of gyroresonance emission ( alissandrakis et al .",
    "1980 ) , in the core of active regions by means of polarized bremsstrahlung ( brosius and holman 1988 ) , both measured in radio wavelengths , by spectropolarimetry of forbidden coronal lines in infrared ( lin , kuhn , and coulter 2004 ; judge et al .  2001 ) , or by coronal seismology applied to oscillating loops ( roberts , edwin , and benz 1984 ) . with the two nlfff methods used in this study , however , we have new tools that are able to measure the 3d magnetic field @xmath193 in a space - filling coronal volume that encompasses entire active regions .",
    "we introduced two methods in section 2 , the phot - nlfff method that uses the 3d magnetic field at the photospheric boundary as input , and the cor - nlfff method that uses a los - magnetogram @xmath21 and the projected 2d coordinates of coronal loops . with these two methods",
    ", the coronal magnetic field can be measured in principle in the entire corona .",
    "however , challenges for the phot - nlfff codes are the non - forcefreeness of the photosphere ( derosa et al .  2009 ) and the heavy computational demands ( ca .",
    "10 - 12 hrs per run ) , while the cor - nlfff code does not have these problems , but may partially suffer from sparseness of suitable loop structures ( uncontaminated by `` moss '' ) in the immediat proximity of sunspots , where the highest field strengths and thus the largest amounts of free energies are measured .",
    "nevertheless , we improved the cor - nlfff code substantially in recent times and obtained reasonable results of the measured magnetic energies in all analyzed flares .",
    "the computational efficiency of the cor - nlfff code makes it possible to obtain these results fast for a large number of flares and many time steps ( in the order of minutes per time step and active region . while the present version of the cor - nlfff code uses an approximative nlfff solution in terms of vertical currents , more accurate nlfff solutions",
    "have been carried out elsewhere ( malanushenko et al . 2014 ) with similar results ( though with manual rather than automated tracing of coronal loops , and with significantly longer computation times ) .",
    "when we talk about magnetic energies in the solar corona , we have to be aware that there are at least three different quantities that can be measured , which are , in order of increasing difficulty : ( i ) the potential energy @xmath0 , ( ii ) the free energy @xmath29 , or the non - potential energy which is the sum of the potential and free energy , @xmath194 , and ( iii ) the dissipated energy @xmath195 during a certain time interval @xmath196 .",
    "all these energies are volume - integrated quantities , @xmath197 , while the energy density @xmath198 is directly related to the magnetic field by @xmath199 .",
    "the potential energy density @xmath200 is related to the potential field @xmath201 , while the free energy density @xmath202 is related to an azimuthal magnetic field component @xmath203 that is perpendicular to the potential field component @xmath201 , because the definition of the nonpotential field , @xmath204 implies that @xmath120 and @xmath119 are perpendicular , according to the pythagoras theorem ( aschwanden 2013b ) .",
    "consequently , the non - potentiality of a magnetic field can easily be inferred from the misalignment angle @xmath205 between the potential @xmath201 and non - potential field @xmath206 .",
    "this misalignment angle is constant along a uniformly helically twisted field line , which corresponds to a constant @xmath38-value of a nonlinear force - free field , and thus constitutes a nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) solution .",
    "since the automated tracing of coronal loops yields a direct measurement of the projected misalignment angle @xmath207 in a 2d image observed in soft x - rays or euv , the cor - nlfff method is particularly sensitive to deviations of the nonpotential field from the potential field .",
    "previous assessments of the non - potentiality of active regions were mostly based on visual inspection of euv images and overlaid potential field lines ( e.g. , schrijver et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "what is the accuracy of our modeling of the coronal magnetic field ? while the potential field @xmath208 ( eqs .",
    "b1 and d2 ) is a zero - order approximation of the coronal magnetic field , the azimuthal field @xmath119 ( eq .  d3 ) due to helical twist is a first - order approximation , the associated free energy @xmath209 is a second - order effect , and the decreases of free energy during a flare , which we call the dissipated energy , is a third - order effect . in table 3",
    "we provide uncertainties for all these measured magnetic quantities .",
    "for the potential field energy , we find a scatter of @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) , which includes the variation of the potential energy during a flare time interval as well as the uncertainty in the forward - fitting of a nlfff solution .",
    "comparing the cor - nlfff with the phot - nlfff code ( table 4 ) , we find a similar degree of accuracy , namely @xmath212 ( @xmath211 ) . for the free energy , which is a second - order effect",
    ", we find an agreement of @xmath213 ( or a factor of @xmath5 ) ( table 4 ) , which includes methodical differences between both codes , such as uncertainties of the transverse field component of the vector magnetograms and spatial averaging effects due to pre - processing in the phot - nlfff method , as well as sparseness of suitable loops free of moss contamination in the proximity of sunspots and separation problems of closely - spaced mixed magnetic polarities in the cor - nlfff method .",
    "even more important , for the dissipated energy , which is a third - order effect , we find an agreement of @xmath214 ( or a factor of 2 ) between the two methods .",
    "we note that the cor - nlfff code is more sensitive than the phot - nlfff code , and detects a significant amount of dissipated energy in all of the 172 analyzed flares , with a significance ratio of @xmath215 . as a caveat",
    ", we have to add that these results were derived under the assumption that all decreases in the free energy during a flare time interval are due to energy dissipation , and that all energy increases during a flare time interval are due to illumination effects ( such as by chromospheric evporation ) , an assumption that we will discuss further in the following section .      as the 60 examples of measurements with the cor - nlfff code shown in figs .  5 - 9 demonstrate",
    ", we almost never observe the naively expected scenario of a constantly elevated level of free energy before a flare , followed by a single - step decrease during the impulsive flare phase , with a constant depleted value afterward . on the other side ,",
    "the phot - nlfff code shows in about half of the cases such a single - step decrease behavior ( figs .  11 - 12 ) , but detects a significantly smaller decrease of free energy in the other half of the cases ( figs .",
    "11 - 12 ) , which raises some questions about the sensitivity of the phot - nlfff code .",
    "it may be hampered due to the averaging effects of the pre - processing technique ( which tries to suppress the non - forcefreeness of the photosphere ) .",
    "so , what can explain this different behaviour in the measurement of free energies of the cor - nlfff method ?",
    "let us discuss first the positive increases of free energy during flaring time intervals .",
    "there are essentially two possibilities : ( i ) incremental storage of free energy , either by continued twisting of the magnetic field , or by new flux emergence with vertical currents , or ( ii ) progressive illumination of nonpotential field structures , such as twisted loops , sigmoids , or twisted filaments , manifested as brightening euv structures , as it can be produced by chromospheric evaporation in the thick - target scenario ( e.g. , antonucci et al .",
    "1982 ; brown 1972 ) .",
    "the first argument can be largely eliminated by the argument of time scales . a statistical study of the nonpotentiality of 95 active regions has lead to the conclusion that the electric currents associated with the nonpotentiality have a characteristic growth and decay time scale of 10 - 30 hrs .",
    "here we analyze the preflare time interval of 172 flares over a much shorter time margin of 0.5 hrs , which is a factor of 20 - 60 times shorter than the characteristic growth and decay time of nonpotentiality , and thus it can readily be neglected .",
    "hence , the only obvious alternative explanation of the observed increases of free energy is due to chromospheric evaporation , which can illuminate twisted loop structures in the preflare phase ( fig .  5 ) , during the rise time of the impulsive flare phase ( fig .",
    "6 ) , as well as during the decay time of the impulsive flare phase ( fig .",
    "therefore , we ignore the time intervals with positive increases in the calculations of the dissipated energy ( in terms of cumulative decreases of free energy )",
    ". a sceptic may even raise the argument that positive increases of the free energy could be caused by uncertainties in the forward - fitted nlfff model . in order to convince ourselves that this is not the case ,",
    "we repeated each forward - fit with three substantially different sets of loops ( see fig .  2 ) and obtain error bars that reflect the uncertainty of the forward - fits due to loop selections , but we find that these error bars are in most cases significantly smaller than the cumulative positive energy increases during the flare time interval .",
    "this means that the energy increases are due to a systematic effect that is significantly above the random noise of the nlfff solutions .    what about the measured energy decreases of free energy .",
    "are they all due to energy dissipation , as we assume in our data analysis technique ( fig .",
    "4 ) ? in principle , additional contributions to negative energy steps could arise from ( i ) decay of nonpotentiality , ( ii ) cooling of the flare plasma that renders twisted structures ( such as sigmoids , helical loops , or twisted filaments ) invisible , or ( iii ) from random fluctuations in the forward - fitting method . again , we can argue in terms of time scales . statistical studies of transient magnetic features associated with significant currents in active regions decay on time scales of @xmath216 hrs ( pevtsov et al .  1994 ) , @xmath217 hrs ( schrijver et al .",
    "2005 ) , or 1 - 2 days ( welsch et al .  2011 ) , which is much shorter than the time interval of 0.5 hrs we analyze after flares in our study . the second option of plasma cooling , can also largely be ruled out by the argument of flare decay time scales observed in euv and soft sxr . although the theoretical time scales of radiative and conductive cooling for a single loop structure can be in the order of @xmath218 hrs ( rosner et al .  1978 ; antiochos 1980 , culhane et al .",
    "1994 ) , the overall cooling time that is observed in a postflare loop system amounts to @xmath219 hrs ( as averaged from the flare durations listed in table 3 ) , which is generally longer than the rapid decay times of @xmath220 hr that are seen for the decreases of free energy ( figs .  5 - 10 ) .",
    "this time scale ratio can be inspected in the 60 time profiles that we show for the evolution of the free energy @xmath59 and the goes light curve @xmath60 in figs .  5 - 10 . and",
    "the third argument can also be eliminated by the fact that the error bars in the free energy solutions ( figs .",
    "5 - 10 and table 3 ) are generally much lower than the negative energy jumps , which is found to have a significance of @xmath215 ( as averaged from table 3 ) .",
    "based on these arguments we justify the assumption made in our data analysis that the impulsive increases of free energy are largely due to `` coronal illumination effects '' , and the rapid energy increases represent the energy dissipation of magnetic energies during flares ( as depicted in fig .",
    "3 ) , which are caused by untwisting and relaxing of field lines after a magnetic reconnection process , according to our model of free energy produced by vertical currents .",

    "the dissipated magnetic energy is believed to constitute the primary source of energy that supplies both flares as well as coronal mass ejection ( cme ) phenomena , while the conversion into thermal energies , non - thermal energies , and cme motion represent secondary energy conversion processes , each one consuming a partial amount of the primary energy .",
    "statistics of secondary energy processes in solar flares , such as hard x - ray emission , have been interpreted early on as a manifestation of nonlinear energy dissipation processes that are governed by self - organized criticality ( soc ) ( lu and hamilton 1991 ) , a concept that was originally developed to explain the powerlaws of earthquake magnitude distributions , originally modeled with cellular automaton models and sandpile avalanches ( bak , tang , and wiesenfeld 1987 ) . a recent review on the application of this soc concept in solar and astrophysics summarizes the developments over the last 25 years ( aschwanden et al .",

    "if we average these poynting fluxes over the entire time span of observations ( 3.5 years ) and an average active region area with a length scale of @xmath309 , we find an average poynting flux of @xmath310 erg @xmath15 s@xmath16 .",
    "this average poynting flux meets the average coronal heating requirement of active regions , which is commonly quoted as @xmath311 erg @xmath15 s@xmath16 , which is needed to balance the observed conductive and radiative losses from the corona ( withbroe et al .  1977 ) .",

    "this explains that some of those global energy estimates were found to be slightly below the coronal heating requirement ( see discussion in section 9.8.3 of aschwanden 2004 ) .",
    "in conclusion we find that the magnetic energy dissipated during solar flares is sufficient to explain the coronal heating problem in active regions .",
    "since most parts of the quiet sun ( essentially all parts of the closed - field corona ) are magnetically connected with active regions , the heating of the quiet sun can equally be explained as a by - product of plasma heating in active regions . only coronal hole regions , which are not magnetically connected with active regions , require a different mechanism to explain a ( low ) coronal temperature ( @xmath327 mk ) in such open - field regions .",
    "we conclude that the dissipated magnetic energies in solar flares , which are measured here with unprecedented statistics , represent the most relevant constituent to identify the energy source of coronal heating .",
    "our results support the view that the solar corona is largely heated by impulsive magnetic energy dissipation processes that reduce the helical twist of the stressed coronal magnetic field during solar flares , most likely faciliated by a magnetic reconnection process .",
    "we started a project on the global energetics of solar flares , using the most recent data from the sdo mission , which contains about 400 goes m and x - class flares during the first 3.5 years of the mission .",
    "in this first study we measure the magnetic energy that is dissipated during solar flares , for 172 events that are located within a longitude of @xmath36 from disk center .",
    "the major results and conclusions can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we are using two complementary nonlinear forcefree field ( nlfff ) codes to measure the dissipated energies during flares .",
    "the phot - nlfff code uses the vector magnetic field ( from hmi / sdo ) measured at the photospheric boundary and extrapolates the forcefree field after pre - processing in order to improve the forcefreeness condition .",
    "the cor - nlfff code uses the line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field component @xmath4 from magnetograms ( from hmi / sdo ) and the geometry of coronal loops as measured in euv images ( from aia / sdo ) in six coronal wavelengths .",
    "the numerical procedure of the cor - nlfff code consists of 3 major steps : ( i ) the decomposition of the magnetogram into buried magnetic charges that define the potential field , ( ii ) automated tracing of coronal loops to obtain the projected 2d coordinates of coronal loops , and ( iii ) forward - fitting of an analytical nlfff approximation , which is based on vertical currents that twist coronal loops , by varying the nonlinear forcefree @xmath38-parameters of the nonpotential field until the misalignment between the model field lines and the observed loop directions is minimized .",
    "the average misalignment angle of all forward - fits is @xmath328 .",
    "we measure the evolution of the potential energy @xmath329 , the free energy @xmath59 , and the dissipated energy @xmath89 during 172 flare events . while the phot - nlfff code mostly detects a step - wise decrease of the free energy during most flares , the cor - nlfff code detects both increases and decreases of the free energy during flares .",
    "we interpret the episodes of increasing free energy as ",
    "coronal illumination effects \" of twisted loop structures during the impulsive flare phase ( such as by chromospheric evaporation ) , while the episodes with decreasing free energies indicate the dissipation of magnetic energies , which can occur before flare start , during the impulsive flare phase , and sometimes are even detected during the flare decay phase .",
    "3 .   comparing the cor - nlfff with the phot - nlfff code , which could be done only for 11 x - class flares due to computational time limitations , we find that the potential and nonpotential energies agree within a few percents for the average of all cases , but vary by a factor of @xmath330 for individual flares , which corresponds to a factor of @xmath331 in the magnetic field .",
    "the agreement of the free energies varies by a factor of @xmath332 , which could be due to model assumptions of the cor - nlfff code ( vertical currents with helical twist can not reproduce horizontally twisted structures ) , or numerical procedures ( pre - processing and heliographic deprojection ) of the phot - nlfff code .",
    "the dissipated energies , which is a third - order effect of the magnetic field model , agree within a factor of @xmath333 between the two codes , where the cor - nlfff code is more sensitive and detects decreases of the free energy in all 172 analyzed flares .",
    "4 .   from the statistics of 172 events analyzed with the cor - nlfff code we find the following empirical scaling laws between the magnetic potential energies ( @xmath0 ) , nonpotential energies @xmath334 , the free energies ( @xmath29 ) , and the dissipated energies @xmath335 : @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath235 , @xmath248 , and @xmath336 . the mean twist angle in a flaring active region is related to the potential energy of the active region by the relationship : @xmath337 erg@xmath338 .",
    "this relationship allows us to predict the magnitude of the largest flare to occur in an active region based on the average twist angle ( or misalignment angle to the potential field ) .",
    "furthermore we found a semi - empirical scaling law between the dissipated energy @xmath29 , the maximum ( azimuthal ) magnetic field strength @xmath281 , and the length scale @xmath282 of the active region : @xmath339 , which is similar to a scaling law found by schrijver et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for coronal heating , i.e. , @xmath306 .",
    "5 .   the size distributions , which we derive here for the first time for magnetic parameters ,",
    "are found to have the following powerlaw slopes : @xmath340 for dissipated energies , @xmath341 for the peak energy dissipation rate , @xmath342 for the flare duration , @xmath343 for flare length scales , @xmath344 for flare areas , and @xmath345 for flare volumes .",
    "the flare volume @xmath346 and the dissipated flare energy @xmath3 are found to scale as @xmath347 .",
    "these results are approximately consistent with the predictions of the fractal - diffusive self - organized criticality ( fd - soc ) model . since soc models describe the statistics of nonlinear energy dissipation processes , the measurement of primary energy parameters , such as the dissipated magnetic energy measured here , are more important then secondary energy parameters , such as thermal or nonthermal energies in solar flares that have been subjected to soc models previously .",
    "the poynting fluxes of dissipated magnetic energies are found to have values in the range of @xmath173 erg @xmath15 s@xmath16 during flare time intervals .",
    "the sum of all magnetic energies dissipated in solar flares is @xmath348 erg during the 3.5 years of observations , yields a temporally and spatially averaged flux of @xmath349 erg @xmath15 s@xmath16 for a mean active region size of @xmath350 , and of @xmath351 erg @xmath15 s@xmath16 when extrapolated down to the nanoflares .",
    "this amount of dissipated magnetic energies is sufficient to explain coronal heating in active regions ( and quiet - sun regions ) .",
    "previous estimates of the global energy budget of the solar corona were based on thermal and nonthermal energies , which represent lower limits to the dissipated magnetic energy only and thus underestimate coronal heating rate .",
    "our results support the view that the solar corona is largely heated by impulsive magnetic energy dissipation processes that reduce the helical twist of the stressed coronal magnetic field during solar flares .",
    "the comparison between two completely different nlfff codes has demonstrated that both codes yield commensurable results ( within a factor of @xmath352 ) , which gives us more confidence in either code . in future studies",
    "we will calculate other forms of energies obtained during flares , such as thermal energies of the heated flare plasma , non - thermal energies of accelerated hard x - ray producing particles , and kinetic energies of cmes .",
    "we will investigate whether those secondary energy products add up to the total dissipated magnetic energies inferred here , and what the relative energy partition in the various flare processes is .",

    "2014 ) .",

    "we learned that the convergence of a forward - fit of a nlfff solution can be substantially degraded if there is a significant amount of false loop structures .",
    "it is therefore imperative to remove as many false loop structures as possible , when using an automated pattern recognition code . in the present study we improved the loop selection criteria further by automated feature detection of 6 types of false loop structures that are visible in euv images .",
    "\\(1 ) curvi - linear structures that have no footpoint directly connected to a magnetic source ( sunspot or magnetic flux concentration in the magnetogram ) are likely to be false loop structures , because most coronal loops are best visible at their footpoints , where usually the maximum of the electron density , emission measure , and euv brightness occurs , due to the hydrostatic stratification .",
    "we detect such unwanted loop structures by the following magnetic proximity requirement , @xmath362^{1/2 } \\le d_{foot } = 0.015 \\ r_{\\odot } \\ ,          \\eqno(a1)\\ ] ] where @xmath363 is the starting point ( @xmath364 ) or end point ( @xmath365 ) of a curvi - linear structure , and @xmath366 is the image position of the next buried magnetic charge ( decomposed from the line - of - sight magnetograms ) of any of the @xmath367 magnetic charges .",
    "about 3.7% of automatically detected curvi - linear structures do not meet the magnetic proximity condition ( table 1 ) .",

    "after the deconvolution of the global maximum in the magnetogram , which yields the first 4 parameers of the model map , we subtract the model distribution @xmath21 of the first magnetic source and continue in the same way by iterating additional magnetic source components . since the magnetogram has positive and negative magnetic field values , the iteration is performed at the unsigned magnetogram , while the correct sign of the magnetic polarity is applied to each deconvolved component . typically , a number of @xmath407 magnetic sources is sufficient to obtain a realistic potential field model of a solar active region .",
    "in the end we renormalize the total unsigned magnetic flux of the model magnetogram to that of the observed magnetogram , in order to compensate for numerical residuals , which is typically in the order of a few percents .",

    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "since the accuracy of the los component @xmath4 is much higher than that of the transverse components @xmath408 , a de - rotation of the magnetogram implies also a variable weighting in the accuracy of the horizontal and vertical magnetic field components . in the extreme case of an active region near the solar limb",
    ", the horizontal field component @xmath409 is measured with the highest accuracy , while the other horizontal component @xmath410 and the vertical component @xmath4 are measured much less accurately .",
    "the accuracy of measuring vertical currents thus varies considerably from center to limb . to our knowledge",
    ", no validation test has been done to demonstrate whether a nlfff solution is invariant to the heliographic position , or whether there is a center - to - limb dependency .",
    "in contrast , the cor - nlfff code takes the full sphericity of the solar surface into account and no de - rotation of magnetograms is required .",
    "since the cor - nlfff code uses only the observed los component of the magnetogram to infer the potential field solution , which is measured with highest accuracy , and does not require the knowledge of the transverse components , which are measured with much less accuracy , the inferred potential field solution should be invariant to solar rotation to first order , as long as small - scale magnetic sources are neglected that suffer from degraded spatial resolution due to projection effects near the limb .",
    "we perform a validation test of this rotational invariance hypothesis in fig .",
    "a bipolar active region is simulated at various longitudes from @xmath411 to @xmath412 ( fig .",
    "21 top panels ) to mimic observed magnetograms .",
    "then we decompose the simulated los magnetogram @xmath413 into two magnetic sources , and calculate a model map @xmath414 , from which we show the profiles @xmath415 along the east - west direction @xmath416 ( fig .  21 , middle panels ) .",
    "then we calculate the ratio of the magnetic energies from the observed and the model map , @xmath417 and find a mean ratio of @xmath418 when averaged over the different longitudes ( fig .  21 , bottom panel ) .",
    "this result proves that the magnetic potential field energy is conserved and invariant to the solar rotation or center - limb - distance , as computed with our cor - nlfff code .",
    "the accuracy starts to degrade at longitudes @xmath419 , which corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath420 solar radii .",
    "thus , our code is able to calculate potential field solutions for a fraction of @xmath421 of active regions that are observed on the solar disk .",
    "the cor - nlfff code is designed to forward - fit an approximate nlfff solution in terms of vertical currents to the geometry of coronal loops .",
    "we use the same parameterization of the potential field solution @xmath31 as described above ( eq .  b1 ) , i.e. , @xmath406 for @xmath381 , but add a nonpotential parameter , the so - called force - free @xmath38-parameter , so that we have 5 variables for each magnetic source , i.e. , @xmath422 .",
    "this force - free @xmath38-parameter represents a helical twist of the non - potential field lines about a vertical axis , for each magnetic charge . requiring a force - free solution that fulfills maxwell s equation , @xmath423 we calculated an analytical approximation in spherical coordinates @xmath424 ( aschwanden 2013a ) , @xmath425 @xmath426 @xmath427 @xmath428 @xmath429 that is accurate to second - order in the parameter @xmath38 or @xmath430 .",
    "while these equations are expressed in a spherical coordinate system that is aligned along the axis @xmath385 with the solar vertical , the sphericity of the sun is taken into full account by transforming the coordinates from each magnetic charge system into a common cartesian coordinate system that has the @xmath431-axis aligned with the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "the resulting nonpotential field @xmath30 is then summed from all magnetic charges , @xmath432 which is also accurate to second - order in the parameter @xmath38 . in the limit of @xmath433 ,",
    "this solution degenerates to a potential field solution ( eq .  b1 ) ,    the numerical fitting technique of the nonpotential field @xmath434 to observed loop coordinates @xmath435 has been initially described in aschwanden & malanushenko ( 2013b ) and was gradually improved over time .",
    "essentially , the nonpotential model parameters @xmath436 have to be optimized until they match the observed loop geometries , while the potential model parameters @xmath437 are left unchanged .",

    ".    the initial guess of the variables start with the potential - field value @xmath433 , if no near - simultaneous nlfff solution exists , while previous solutions of @xmath443 are used for time series with @xmath444 time frames .",
    "this strategy warrants more continuouity of the nlfff solution for sequential calculations with small time steps ( say with time steps of @xmath445 hour ) .",
    "most of the magnetic energy is contained in the strongest sources , typically the 10 strongest magnetic sources contain about 90% of the magnetic energy .",
    "therefore we need to vary only a subset of values @xmath79 that correspond to the strongest magnetic sources , say @xmath446 for @xmath447 , which represent @xmath448 , and thus about 99% of the magnetic energy .",
    "moreover we apply also a minimum distance criterion ( @xmath449 ) between nonpotential magnetic charges , in order to avoid magnetic flux cancellation of spatially overlapping magnetic sources with opposite magnetic polarity .",
    "a typical separation distance requirement of @xmath450 reduces the maximum number of magnetic charges ( @xmath367 ) , used in the decomposition of the magnetogram , to @xmath451 values of @xmath79 , which yields also a more unique solution and speeds up the convergence of the forward - fitting code .",
    "since the loop tracing method provides 2d coordinates @xmath20 $ ] only , while 3d coordinates @xmath354 $ ] are required to enable forward - fitting with a 3d nlfff model , we have to estimate the third coordinate @xmath452 for each loop position in every forward - fitting iteration cycle .",
    "we estimate the 3d geometry of loops by using a circular geometry for each fitted loop segment , parameterized by a loop curvature radius @xmath453 , a loop apex altitude @xmath454 , and two footpoint locations at either end of the traced loop segments ( fig .",

    "the reconstruction of the best - fit 3d loop geometry is updated with every optimization cycle of @xmath38-values .",
