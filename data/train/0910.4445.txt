    "for many years , two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems have been the focus of considerable attention due to the interesting interplay between interactions , disorder and dimensionality in determining the electronic ground state .",
    "@xcite while scaling theory predicted that all 2d systems are driven into an insulating ground state by arbitrarily weak impurity scattering ,  @xcite it was subsequently shown that superconductivity should survive well into the localized phase .",
    "@xcite from an experimental perspective , superconducting , metallic and insulating ground states have been observed in ultrathin metal films ,  @xcite with transitions between these states induced by tuning the film thickness  @xcite or applying a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    the 2d superconductor - insulator transition has been studied in a variety of ultrathin films with differing compositions ( e.g. , elemental metals , alloys , etc . ) and morphologies ( e.g. , amorphous , crystalline , granular , etc . ) .",
    "@xcite disorder in these films is heavily dependent upon morphology , producing many sample - specific behaviors , for example , quasi - reentrant transitions  @xcite and anomalous magnetoresistance peaks.@xcite these behaviors are much more common in granular systems , and thus their observation in a new material system may provide important clues to its morphology .",
    "we recently reported a novel superconducting material produced by evaporating a thin film of sn / sb alloy onto a polyetheretherketone ( peek ) substrate and subsequently mixing the metal into the peek surface using a nitrogen ion - beam .",
    "@xcite here we show that a superconductor - insulator transition can be driven by controlling the thickness of the layer and the implant temperature .",
    "we observe peaks in the magnetoresistance of an insulating sample close to this phase transition .",
    "we show that these magnetoresistance peaks are caused by the competition between weak localization and superconductivity .",
    "the samples studied are produced and measured using methods reported previously .",
    "@xcite to summarize briefly , we commence with cleaned peek substrates onto which a thin film of 19:1 sn : sb is deposited by thermal evaporation . for the metal - mixed samples , ion - implantation",
    "was then performed using a 0.37  @xmath0a@xmath1 , @xmath2  kev n@xmath3 ion - beam that illuminated a circular area @xmath4  mm in diameter to a dose of @xmath5  ions/@xmath6 . during implantation",
    ", the sample is mounted on a temperature controlled stage , which is vital to achieving working samples .",
    "electrical contacts were produced by shadow - masked evaporation of @xmath2  nm ti followed by @xmath2  nm au onto the four corners of each sample , and the sample is cut into a van der pauw configuration ensuring that the unimplanted regions do not short out measurement of the implanted region .",

    "the four metal - mixed samples form a @xmath12 set with two nominal sn : sb alloy thicknesses ( @xmath13     and @xmath9   ) and two sample temperatures during implantation ( @xmath14  k and @xmath15  k ) . to avoid thickness variations from interfering with studies of implant temperature ,",
    "the samples for each temperature are cut as pieces from a larger film coated with a specified thickness of sn : sb in a single evaporation .",
    "the fifth sample is an unimplanted sn : sb film with nominal thickness @xmath9     ( produced separately from the set of four metal - mixed samples ) , which provides an interesting counterpoint to the magnetoresistance data obtained from the @xmath13     thick metal - mixed samples .",
    "before focusing on the key features of the samples , we first make some general comments regarding the sample set that we chose to measure .",
    "the electronic properties of metal - mixed polymers can be controlled via a number of parameters involved in the fabrication , including substrate composition ; pre - implant metal film thickness and composition ; beam energy , current , dose and species ; and implantation conditions such as temperature .",
    "an exhaustive exploration of this very large , multidimensional parameter space is clearly an onerous task , forcing us to be selective in order to make progress .    for this paper ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to a small sample set focused on two key parameters .",
    "the first is the pre - implant metal thickness because it provides the easiest control over the conductivity , even though this can be a slightly difficult parameter to control with precision .",
    "@xcite the second is the implant temperature , which we believe provides some control over the disorder of the resulting film , as we will show in the next section . a more extensive study of the role of the fabrication and ion - implantation parameters in determining the sample conductivity will be the subject of a separate , forthcoming paper .          we will start by considering the two @xmath9     metal - mixed samples , which exhibit a metallic temperature dependence for temperatures greater than the critical temperature @xmath16 and a clean transition to a global ( i.e. , sample - wide ) zero resistance state . comparing the resistance measured between the four contact pairs along the sides of the sample and two pairs running diagonally , both of these samples are relatively isotropic ( cf .",

[ fig : nzfig1 ] for samples implanted at @xmath15  k and @xmath14  k respectively .",
    "considering , for example , the data at @xmath23  k , the critical field , @xmath24 , is lower and the transition width , @xmath25 , is larger for the @xmath14  k sample , again pointing to higher disorder in this sample .",
    "this dependence of the sample properties on implant temperature points to an ability to fine - tune the sample properties via the implant parameters , over and above the tuning provided by the metal thickness .",

    "@xcite both of these samples are in the insulating regime ( i.e. , resistivity increases with decreasing @xmath7 ) , however an unfortunate side - effect is that the electronic properties of these samples are significantly more anisotropic .",
    "this makes it impossible to sensibly obtain the resistivity through four - terminal measurements , and hence all resistance measurements that we report for the @xmath13     samples are two - terminal measurements . due to the strong anisotropy ,",

    "such incomplete superconducting transitions are common in granular metal films on the insulating side near to the metal - insulator transition .",

    "@xcite    in contrast , along the @xmath39-direction in this sample [ see fig . [",

    "the observed anisotropy in this material can be explained with a granular model where some grains are insulating , while others are superconducting and may be coupled via the josephson or proximity effects .",
    "anisotropies in the grain distribution result in there being no percolation path for superconductivity in the @xmath39-direction , whereas in the @xmath38-direction a percolation path does exist or is very weakly broken [ consistent with the small , but non - zero , resistance in this direction , fig .

    "the resistance becomes constant in @xmath10 at sufficiently high fields as the effects of superconductivity and weak localization are quenched .",
