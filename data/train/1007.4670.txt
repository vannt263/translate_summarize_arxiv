    "the question of understanding entanglement in non - inertial frames has been central to the development of the emerging field of relativistic quantum information @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this field is to incorporate relativistic effects to improve quantum information tasks ( such as quantum teleportation ) and to understand how such protocols would take place in curved space - times . in most quantum information protocols entanglement",
    "plays a prominent role .",
    "therefore , it is of a great interest to understand how it can be degraded @xcite or created @xcite by the presence of horizons or spacetime dynamics .",
    "previous analyses show that entanglement between modes of bosonic or fermionic fields are degraded from the perspective of observers moving in uniform acceleration . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the validity of the single - mode approximation commonly used in such analyses and show that the approximation is justified only for a special family of states .",
    "the single - mode approximation , which was introduced in @xcite has been extensively used in the literature not only in discussions concerning entanglement but also in other relativistic quantum information scenarios @xcite .",
    "a deeper understanding of how the unruh effect degrades entanglement is of crucial importance not only for fundamental questions but also to engineer a practical method to experimentally detect such effect .",
    "so far , not only has the effect not been measured but its very existence has been subject to some controversy ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in the canonical scenario considered in the study of entanglement in non - inertial frames the field , from the inertial perspective ,",
    "is considered to be in a state where all modes are in the vacuum state except for two of them which are in a two - mode entangled state .",
    "for example , the bell state @xmath0 where m labels minkowski states and @xmath1 , @xmath2 are two minkowski frequencies .",
    "two inertial observers , alice and bob , each carrying a monocromatic detector sensitive to frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , would find maximal correlations in their measurements since the bell state is maximally entangled .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate to what degree the state is entangled when described by observers in uniform acceleration . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "alice is again considered to be inertial and an uniformly accelerated observer rob is introduced , who carries a monocromatic detector sensitive to mode @xmath2 .",
    "to study this situation , the states corresponding to rob must be transformed into the appropriate basis , in this case , the rindler basis .",
    "it is then when the single - mode approximation is invoked to relate minkowski single particle states @xmath3 to states in rindler space .",
    "we argue that the single - mode approximation is not valid for general states .",
    "however , the approximation holds for a family of peaked minkowski wave packets provided constraints imposed by an appropriate fourier transform are satisfied .",
    "we show that the state analyzed canonically in the literature corresponds to an entangled state between a minkowski and a special type of unruh mode .",
    "we therefore revise previous results for both bosonic and fermionic field entanglement .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained under the single - mode approximation .",
    "we confirm that entanglement is degraded with acceleration , vanishing in the infinite acceleration limit in the bosonic case and reaching a non - vanishing minimum for fermionic fields .",
    "however , we find that in the fermionic case , the degree to which entanglement is degraded depends on the election of unruh modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we introduce in section [ sec3 ] the transformations between minkowski , unruh and rindler modes . in section",
    "[ sec : entganglementrev ] , we analyze the entanglement degradation due to the unruh effect for scalar fields including corrections to the single - mode approximation .",
    "we exhibit in section [ sec : peaking ] states for which the single - mode approximation is justified in the massless and massive bosonic case . in section [ sec5 ] the degradation of entanglement between fermionic modes is addressed .",
    "finally , conclusions and discussions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a real massless scalar field @xmath4 in a two - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "the field equation is the massless klein - gordon equation , @xmath5 .",
    "the ( indefinite ) klein - gordon inner product reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a future - pointing normal vector to the spacelike hypersurface @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the volume element on  @xmath8 .",
    "the klein - gordon equation can be solved in minkowski coordinates @xmath10 which are an appropriate choice for inertial observers .",
    "the positive energy mode solutions with respect to the timelike killing vector field @xmath11 are given by @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the minkowski frequency and the discrete index @xmath14 takes the value @xmath15 for modes with positive momentum ( the right - movers ) and the value @xmath16 for modes with negative momentum ( the left - movers ) .",
    "as the right - movers and the left - movers decouple , we have suppressed the index @xmath14 on the left - hand side of and we continue to do so in all the formulas . the mode solutions and their complex conjugates are normalised in the usual sense of dirac delta - functions in @xmath1 as @xmath17    the klein - gordon equation can also be separated in coordinates that are adapted to the rindler family of uniformly accelerated observers .",
    "let region i ( respectively region ii ) denote the wedge @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . in each of the wedges , we introduce the rindler coordinates @xmath20 by @xcite @xmath21     are hyperbolae and all curves of constant @xmath22 are straight lines that come from the origin .",
    "an uniformly accelerated observer rob travels along a hyperbola constrained to either region i or region ii . ]    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 individually in each wedge .",
    "the curve @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a positive constant of dimension inverse length , is then the world line of a uniformly - accelerated observer whose proper acceleration equals  @xmath26 , and the proper time of this observer is given by @xmath27 in i and by @xmath28 in  ii .",
    "note that @xmath29 is a timelike killing vector in both i and  ii , and it is future - pointing in i but past - pointing in  ii .    separating the klein - gordon equation in regions i and ii in the rindler coordinates yields the solutions @xmath30 where @xmath31 again corresponds to right - movers and @xmath32 to left - movers , @xmath33 is a positive dimensionless constant and @xmath34 is a positive constant of dimension length .",
    "as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the positive frequency mode functions with respect to the future - pointing rindler killing vectors @xmath39 in their respective wedges , and @xmath33 is the dimensionless rindler frequency . the dimensional frequency with respect to the proper time of a rindler observer located at @xmath25 is given in terms of the dimensionless @xmath33 by @xmath40 .",
    "the modes are delta - normalised in @xmath33 in their respective wedges as usual .",
    "note that the choice of the constant @xmath34 is equivalent to specifying the phase of the rindler modes .",
    "this choice is hence purely a matter of convention , and it can be made independently for each @xmath33 and  @xmath14 .",
    "we shall shortly specify the choice so that the transformation between the minkowski and rindler modes becomes simple .    a third basis of interesting solutions to the field equation is provided by the unruh modes , defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "while the unruh modes have a sharp rindler frequency , an analytic continuation argument shows that they are purely positive frequency linear combinations of the minkowski modes  @xcite .",
    "it is hence convenient to examine the transformation between the minkowski and rindler modes in two stages :    * the well - known transformation between the unruh and rindler modes isolates the consequences of the differing minkowski and rindler definitions of positive frequency . *",
    "the less well - known transformation between the minkowski and unruh modes @xcite shows that a monochromatic wave in the rindler basis corresponds to a non - monochromatic superposition in the minkowski basis .",
    "it is these latter effects from which the new observations in this paper will stem .    to find the bogoliubov transformations that relate the bases , we expand the field in each of the bases as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the minkowski , unruh and rindler annihilation operators , respectively . the usual bosonic commutation relations @xmath47",

    "the transformation between the unruh and rindler bases is given by  .",
    "the transformation between the minkowski and unruh bases can be evaluated by taking appropriate inner products of formula with the mode functions  @xcite , with the result @xmath54 where @xmath55 by the properties of the gamma - function ( @xcite , formula 5.4.3 ) , we can take advantage of the arbitrariness of the constants @xmath34 and choose them so that simplifies to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an overall constant of dimension length , independent of @xmath14 and  @xmath33 .",

    "however , @xmath62 does not coincide with the rindler vacuum : if one makes the ansatz @xmath63 is the state with @xmath64 rindler @xmath52-excitations over the rindler @xmath52-vacuum @xmath65 , and similarly @xmath66 is the state with @xmath64 rindler @xmath53-excitations over the rindler @xmath53-vacuum @xmath67 , use of shows that the coefficient functions are given by @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath62 is thus a two - mode squeezed state of rindler excitations over the rindler vacuum for each  @xmath33 .",
    "although states with a completely sharp value of @xmath33 are not normalisable , we may approximate normalisable wave packets that are sufficiently narrowly peaked in @xmath33 by taking a fixed @xmath33 and renormalising the unruh and rindler commutators to read @xmath69=[a_{\\omega,\\text{\\text{l}}},a^{\\dagger}_{\\omega,\\text{\\text{l}}}]=1 $ ] and @xmath70 = [ a_{\\omega,\\text{ii}},a^{\\dagger}_{\\omega,\\text{ii}}]=1 $ ] , with the commutators for mixed @xmath50 , @xmath51 and mixed @xmath52 , @xmath53 vanishing . in this idealisation of sharp",
    "peaking in  @xmath33 , the most general creation operator that is of purely positive minkowski frequency can be written as a linear combination of the two unruh creation operators , in the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are complex numbers with @xmath74 .",
    "note that @xmath75=1 $ ] . from",
    "and we then see that adding into minkowski vacuum one idealised particle of this kind , of purely positive minkowski frequency , yields the state @xmath76    in previous studies on relativistic quantum information , it has been common to consider a state of the form with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the above discussion shows that this choice for @xmath72 and @xmath73 is rather special ; in particular , it breaks the symmetry between the right and left rindler wedges .",
    "we shall address next how entanglement is modified for these sharp @xmath33 states when both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are present , and we then turn to examine the assumption of sharp  @xmath33 .",
    "in the relativistic quantum information literature , the single mode approximation @xmath79 is considered to relate minkowski and unruh modes . the main argument for taking this approximation",
    "is that the distribution @xmath80\\text{d}\\omega\\ ] ] is peaked .",
    "however , we can see from equations that this distribution in fact oscillates and it is not peaked at all .",
    "entanglement in non - inertial frames can be studied provided we consider the state @xmath81 where the states corresponding to @xmath33 are unruh states . in this case , a single unruh frequency @xmath33 corresponds to the same rindler frequency . in the special case @xmath82 and @xmath78",
    "we recover the results canonically presented in the literature @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will revise the analysis of entanglement in non - inertial frames for the general unruh modes .",
    "however , since a minkowski monochromatic basis seems to be a natural choice for inertial observers , we will show in the section [ sec : peaking ] that the standard results also hold for minkowski states as long as special minkowski wavepackets are considered .",
    "having the expressions for the vacuum and single particle states in the minkowski , unruh and rindler basis enables us to return to the standard scenario for analyzing the degradation of entanglement from the perspective of observers in uniform acceleration .",
    "let us consider the maximally entangled state eq .",
    "from the perspective of inertial observers . by choosing different @xmath83 we can vary the states under consideration .",
    "an arbitrary unruh single particle state has different right and left components where @xmath84 represent the respective weighs .",
    "when working with unruh modes , there is no particular reason why to choose a specific @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , and as as we will see later , feasible elections of minkowski states are in general , linear superpositions of different unruh modes with different values of @xmath83 .",
    "the minkowski - unruh state under consideration can be viewed as an entangled state of a tri - partite system .",
    "the partitions correspond to the three sets of modes : minkowski modes with frequency @xmath1 and two sets of unruh modes ( left and right ) with frequency @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to define the following bi - partitions : the alice - bob bi - partition corresponds to minkowski and right unruh modes while the alice - antibob bipartition refers to minkowski and left unruh modes .",
    "we will see that the distribution of entanglement in these bi - partitions becomes relevant when analyzing the entanglement content is the state from the non - inertial perspective .",
    "we now want to study the entanglement in the state considering that the @xmath33 modes are described by observers in uniform acceleration .",
    "therefore , unruh states must be transformed into the rindler basis .",
    "the state in the minkowski - rinder basis is also a state of a tri - partite system .",
    "therefore , we define the alice - rob bi - partition as the minkowski and region i rindler modes while the alice - antirob bi - partitions corresponds to minkowski and region ii rindler modes . in the limit of very small accelerations",
    "alice - rob and alice - antirob approximate to alice - bob and alice - antibob bi - partitions respectively .",
    "this is because , as shown in and , region i ( ii ) rindler modes tend to r ( l ) unruh modes in such limit",
    ".    the entanglement can be quantified using the peres partial - transpose criterion . since the partial transpose of a separable state has always positive eigenvalues , the a state is non - separable ( and therefore , entangled ) if the partial transposed density matrix has , at least , one negative eigenvalue . however , this is a sufficient and necessary condition only for @xmath85 and @xmath86 dimensional systems . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the criterion is only necessary .",
    "based on the peres criterion a number of entanglement measures have been introduced . in our analysis",
    "we will use the negativity @xmath87 to account for the quantum correlations between the different bipartitions of the system .",

    "in what follows we study the entanglement between the alice - rob and alice - antirob modes . after expressing rob s modes in the rindler basis ,",

    "the alice and rob states are further assumed to be orthogonal to each other , so that the system can be treated as bipartite .",
    "we now discuss the sense in which these assumptions are a good approximation to alice and rob states that can be built as minkowski wave packets .",

    "the blue continuous ( red dashed ) curves from top to bottom ( from bottom to top ) correspond , to @xmath105 respectively .",
    "all the curves for alice - antirob entanglement have a minimum , except from the extreme case @xmath256    we confirm that the case @xmath106 reproduced the results reported in the literature @xcite . the entanglement between alice - rob modes",
    "is degraded as the acceleration parameter increases reaching a non - vanishing minimum value in the infinite acceleration limit @xmath257 .",
    "however , while the entanglement alice - rob decreases , entanglement between the alice - antirob partition ( dashed line ) grows .",
    "interestingly , the quantum correlations between the bipartitions alice - rob and alice - antirob fulfill a conservation law @xmath258 . note that the choice @xmath259 corresponds to an exchange of the alice - rob and alice - antirob bipartitions .",
    "in such case , the entanglement between alice and anti - robs s modes degrades with acceleration while the entanglement between alice and rob s modes grows .",
    "in fact , regarding entanglement , the role of the alice - rob and alice - antirob partitions are exchanged when @xmath260 .",
    "this is because there is an explicit symmetry between field excitations in the rindler wedges .",
    "therefore , we will limit our analysis to @xmath261 .",
    "in the fermionic case different choices of @xmath107 result in different degrees of entanglement between modes . in particular , the amount of entanglement in the limit of infinite acceleration depends on this choice .",

    "the entanglement from the inertial perspective is equally distributed between between the alice - bob and alice - antibob partitions and adds up to @xmath265 which corresponds to the total entanglement between alice - bob when @xmath106 . in the infinite acceleration limit , the case @xmath266 reaches the minimum total entanglement . to understand this",
    "we note that the entanglement in the alice - rob bipartition for @xmath261 is always monotonic . however , this is not the case for the entanglement between the alice - antirob modes . consider the plot in fig .",
    "[ bundlef ] for the cases @xmath267 , for small accelerations , entanglement is degraded in both bipartitons .",
    "however , as the acceleration increases , entanglement between alice - antirob modes is created compensating the entanglement lost between alice - rob . the equilibrium point between degradation and creation",
    "is the minimum that alice - antirob entanglement curves present .",
    "therefore , if @xmath268 the entanglement lost is not entirely compensated by the creation of entanglement between alice - antirob resulting in a less entangled state in the infinite acceleration limit .    in the case",
    "@xmath264 entanglement is always degraded between alice - antirob modes resulting in the state , among all the possible elections of unruh modes , with less entanglement in the infinite acceleration limit .",
    "we have shown that the single - mode approximation used in the relativistic quantum information literature , especially to analyse entanglement between field modes from the perspective of observers in uniform acceleration , does not hold for general states .",
    "the single - mode approximation attempts to relate a single minkowski frequency mode ( observed by inertial observers ) with a single rindler frequency mode ( observed by uniformly accelerated observers ) .",
    "we show that the state canonically analysed in the literature corresponds to a maximally entangled state of a minkowski mode and a specific kind of unruh mode ( not two minkowski modes ) .",
    "we analyse the entanglement between two bosonic or fermionic modes in the case when , from the inertial perspective , the state corresponds to a maximally entangled state between a minkowski frequency mode and an arbitrary unruh frequency mode .",
    "we find that the entanglement between modes described by an unruh observer and a rindler observer constrained to move in rindler region i ( alice - rob ) are always degraded with acceleration . in the bosonic case ,",
    "the entanglement between the inertial modes and region ii rindler modes ( alice - antirob ) are also degraded with acceleration .",
    "we find that , in this case , the rate of entanglement degradation is independent of the choice of unruh modes .",
    "for the fermionic case the entanglement between the inertial and region i rindler modes ( alice - rob ) is degraded as the acceleration increases reaching a minimum value when it tends to infinity",
    ". there is , therefore , entanglement survival in the limit of infinite acceleration for any choice of unruh modes .",
    "however , we find an important difference with the bosonic case : the amount of surviving entanglement depends on the specific election of such modes .",
    "we also find that the entanglement between inertial and region ii rindler modes ( alice - antirob ) can be created and degraded depending on the election of unruh modes .",
    "this gives rise to different values of entanglement in the infinite acceleration limit .",
    "interestingly , in the fermionic case one can find a state which is most resilient to entanglement degradation .",
    "this corresponds to the unruh mode with @xmath106 which is the unruh mode considered in the canonical studies of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it could be argued that this is the most natural choice of unruh modes since for this choice ( @xmath269 ) the entanglement for very small accelerations ( @xmath270 ) is mainly contained in the subsystem alice - rob . in this case",
    ", there is nearly no entanglement between the alice - antirob modes .",
    "however , other choices of unruh modes become relevant if one wishes to consider an entangled state from the inertial perspective which involves only minkowski frequencies .",
    "we have shown that a minkowski wavepacket involving a superposition of general unruh modes can be constructed in such way that the corresponding rindler state involves a single frequency .",
    "this result is especially interesting since it presents an instance where the single - mode approximation can be considered recovering the standard results in the literature .",
