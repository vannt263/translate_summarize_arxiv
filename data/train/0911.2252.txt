    "another manifestation of this phenomenon is the existence of a morphology - density relation @xcite , which implies that a higher fraction of ellipticals than either spirals or irregulars , reside in denser environments .",
    "spiral and irregular galaxies are more likely to populate less dense regions .",
    "however , the origin and relation between these dependences are still not fully understood .",
    "they are usually discussed in terms of a _ nature _ or _ nurture _ scenario , i.e. being intrinsic properties of galaxies at formation or originated from the interaction of galaxies with their environment all along their cosmic evolution .    at higher redshifts ,",
    "our knowledge of galaxy clustering properties remains fragmentary .",
    "we know little about the clustering of the various morphological types .",
    "deep surveys have detected an evolution in the global galaxy clustering with redshift up to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "additional results indicate that the luminosity , colour , and spectral type dependences of clustering evolve with redshift .",
    "a less significant segregation is evident when we consider the dependence of clustering on either colour or spectral type , the difference in clustering strength between red / early - type and blue / late - type galaxies being shallower at @xmath6 than at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these observations are consistent with the accepted picture of hierarchical clustering growth and galaxy evolution , in which cold dark matter haloes form from the gravitational collapse of dark matter around peaks in the density field .",
    "haloes evolve hierarchically , such that smaller haloes assemble to form larger and more massive haloes in high - density regions @xcite . in parallel , galaxies form within haloes , by means of the cooling of hot baryonic gas @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "luminous and massive galaxies are expected to be more strongly clustered than fainter and less massive ones that tend to form in less clustered haloes , which are less biased with respect to the underlying mass distribution . moreover ,",
    "early - type galaxies , which are in general brighter than late - type galaxies , are more strongly clustered .",
    "this difference is thought to be related to their different formation histories .",
    "early - type galaxies are understood to be the product of interaction processes ( e.g. galaxy merging ) and/or physical mechanisms that take place in dense environments , although mergers are more common in less dense group environments than at galaxy cluster cores @xcite . instead",
    ", late - type galaxies may not experience such dramatic events , being more likely to reside in less dense environments .",
    "mergers are expected to affect galaxy morphology by creating or growing a galaxy bulge component , albeit a large gas fraction may result in a galaxy temporarily re - growing a disk .",
    "they contribute to the evolving number densities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and clustering properties of different types of galaxies .",
    "galaxy colours or spectral types are often used as proxies for galaxy morphologies , but are affected by uncertainties in tracing the same underlying galaxy populations across cosmic time .",
    "for instance , a disk galaxy containing an old stellar population would be classified as an early - type object . in a similar way",
    ", a starburst galaxy heavily obscured by dust would be classified as a red , early - type galaxy .",
    "in contrast , an old and red stellar population may dominate the measured stellar mass of an object , but the galaxy colour can be blue because of a recent burst of star formation .",
    "colours are primarily related to galaxy recent star formation history at variance with morphologies , which may be the result of the interaction of galaxies with their surroundings .",
    "selecting galaxies by colour or spectral type , or by morphology may give one different views on galaxy evolution and environmental effects at work .",
    "studying how galaxy clustering depends on morphology and cosmic epoch may thus provide important and complementary clues to mechanisms through which galaxies developed into the population we see today .",
    "such a study has not yet been possible at @xmath7 because of the lack of high resolution imaging surveys of sufficient size . the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos , * ? ? ?",

    "observations have used the medium resolution red grism with @xmath16 arcsec slits , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath17 at 2.5   @xmath18 . the velocity uncertainty in the redshifts is estimated to be @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "the survey strategy , which consists of 8 passes of the vimos spectrograph across the field , will allow us to reach in the end a high sampling rate of about @xmath21 over the entire field @xcite .",
    "in the present analysis , we use the first epoch zcosmos - bright spectroscopic sample ( also called _ zcosmos 10k - bright sample _ ) , which is based on the first two years of observations performed in 2005 - 2006 .",

    "it consists of @xmath24 magnitude - selected objects according to @xmath25 .",
    "this selection provides a redshift distribution in the range @xmath26 that peaks at @xmath27 .",
    "a confidence class has been assigned to each object of the sample to characterise the confidence in the redshift determination and its nature . in this work",

    "our sample thus represents @xmath35 of the full first - epoch zcosmos - bright catalogue ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the zcosmos survey is able to benefit from the unprecedented multiwavelength coverage of the cosmos field @xcite , which permits us to compute very accurate photometric redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "by incorporating the photometric redshift consistency information , we reach a spectroscopic confirmation rate of @xmath36 . the zcosmos survey design and the basic properties of the zcosmos - bright catalogue",
    "are fully described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a unique advantage of the cosmos / zcosmos surveys is the hst - acs high resolution imaging @xcite that is available over an area of @xmath15 . in particular , these data allow us to determine directly the morphology of galaxies out to @xmath37 .",
    "morphologies used in this work were estimated using a robust classification scheme based on three non - parametric diagnostics of galaxy structure : concentration , asymmetry , and the gini coefficient @xcite .",
    "we first computed the distance of each galaxy in the multi - parameter space with respect to each galaxy of a control sample of 500 galaxies that had been visually classified .",
    "a morphological class was then assigned to each galaxy depending on the most frequent class among those of the @xmath38 nearest neighbours in the control sample .",
    "the use of the @xmath38 nearest neighbours has been chosen as it maximises the completeness of the different classes in our sample .",
    "galaxies were classified into three main morphological types : early - type , spiral , and irregular , with the early - type including both elliptical and lenticular galaxies ( s0 ) .",
    "the classifier was optimised to be insensitive to band - shifting and surface brightness dimming . since the classification is performed using a single photometric band and we study a relatively broad range of redshifts , our morphology measurements may be biased as a function of redshift because of the band - shifting effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite our morphologies can only be affected at redshifts greater than @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the effect is small when only two broad classes of early- and late - type galaxies are defined @xcite , which is the case here . in practice",
    ", spiral galaxies can be misclassified as irregulars but , since we define a broad class of late - type galaxies that includes both spiral and irregular galaxies , our analysis is unaffected by this bias .",
    "we evaluated the contamination and completeness of the different classes by applying our automated classifier to the control sample and comparing the resulting classification with the visual one .",
    "this comparison showed that our classification scheme is rather robust with only a small contamination of about @xmath39 for each class when considering only two broad classes of early - type and spiral+irregular galaxies .",
    "we verified , using more conservative morphological classes with almost no contamination but larger incompleteness ( i.e. the  clean  sample of * ? ? ?",

    "the effect is much smaller than the statistical error on @xmath40measurements .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a full description of the classification scheme and the properties of the morphological sample .",
    "in this study we focus on two broad classes : early types and late types , the latter referring to galaxies morphologically classified as either spirals or irregulars . because of the slightly different geometries of the cosmos - acs and zcosmos - bright fields , a small number of galaxies in the zcosmos - bright catalogue do not have morphological measurements .",
    "these galaxies , which represent @xmath41 of the zcosmos - bright sample , are indicated by crosses in fig .",

    "we consider a nearly volume - limited sample where galaxies are selected to be of absolute magnitude below a given threshold and to populate a complete comoving volume in the considered redshift interval .",

    "the selection is performed on the basis of the galaxy @xmath12-band absolute magnitudes to facilitate comparison with other studies .",
    "we include an intrinsic luminosity evolution in the definition of the sample by considering a linearly evolving absolute magnitude cut such as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant .",

    "we note that we used @xmath49 values obtained by keeping the faint - end slope of the luminosity function @xmath50 fixed .",
    "this is a reasonable decision since @xmath50 does not clearly exhibit any type of evolution at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "we adopted this approach to avoid compensating for the luminosity evolution with an artificial increase in @xmath50 .",

    "this non - uniform sampling is produced during the designing of slit masks to optimise the total number of slits , and in turn produces two layers of spectra in each mask @xcite .",
    "this problem is more severe for zcosmos - bright than vvds because of the use of a higher resolution grism and consequently longer spectra on the detector , which limit the degree of freedom of the slit positioning algorithm .",

    "the empty squares show the relative bias obtained while removing all the galaxies inhabiting the rich structures in excess in the zcosmos sample ( see text for details).,width=317 ]    the observed relative clustering between different galaxy types can provide us with valuable information on the properties of the galaxy formation bias ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in general , local biasing models predict constant scale - independent relative clustering on large scales @xcite .",
    "this prediction remains in any model where the galaxy type is correlated with the local density .",
    "we note that here `` local '' refers to scales over which material in non - linear structures has mixed during the cosmic history .",
    "this behaviour disagrees with models of non - local bias in which , for instance , the galaxy formation efficiency is coherently modulated over large scales because of ionising radiation @xcite or suppressed in randomly distributed voids @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the large - scale relative clustering is expected to be scale - dependent @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for references [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , and [ 4 ] , the large - scale relative bias is calculated from the power - law best - fits to the @xmath40of elliptical / s0 ( early - type ) and spiral ( late - type ) galaxies ; errors are obtained by propagating errors in the individual power - law parameters .",
    "figure [ brel ] shows the relative clustering ( or relative bias ) @xmath110 of early- to late - type galaxies in the range @xmath111@xmath64 mpcobtained in our sample and from sdss measurements as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) correspond respectively to the projected correlation function and the bias of early - type ( late - type ) galaxies with respect to the mass ; @xmath117 is the projected correlation function of mass . at @xmath3",
    ", the relative bias shows a scale - dependence in the regime where clustering is non - linear , i.e. on small scales , but tends asymptotically to a constant value on larger scales .",
    "it varies from @xmath118 at @xmath119@xmath64 mpcto @xmath120 at @xmath121@xmath64 mpc , confirming previously reported clustering measurements in the local universe @xcite .",
    "the observed large - scale behaviour of the relative bias then supports a locally biased galaxy formation scenario , in which the definition of early and late morphological types may be directly or indirectly related to the local environment .",
    "moreover the large value of the relative bias on small scales , i.e. below 1@xmath64 mpc , suggests that a fraction of early - type galaxies formed recently and preferentially in dense environments . at @xmath0 ,",
    "in contrast , the scale dependence is much less important or absent .",
    "these results may indicate that a fraction of early - type galaxies may have formed at epochs later than @xmath0 by the merging of late - type galaxies ( perhaps through major mergers ) , in relatively dense environments .    from the relative bias of early- to late - type galaxies , we derived the large - scale linear relative bias @xmath122 by averaging @xmath110 on scales of @xmath123@xmath64 mpc .",
    "our measurement , corrected for the effect of the excess of rich structures in the field , is reported in table [ breltab ] where it is compared with @xmath5 measurements .",
    "interestingly , we find in our sample a value of @xmath122 similar to that measured in the local samples and in particular in the sdss .",
    "this finding suggests that most of the dependence of galaxy clustering on morphology was already in place at @xmath0 for @xmath124 galaxies .",
    "we have measured the dependence of clustering on morphology at @xmath42 for galaxies of luminosity greater than @xmath45 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used the first epoch zcosmos - bright spectroscopic sample of galaxies , our study benefiting from the availability of high resolution hst imaging for the cosmos field .",
    "we have computed the projected correlations function in volume - limited samples of two broad morphological classes , early types ( elliptical / s0 ) and late types ( spiral / irregular ) and have compared them to @xmath3 sdss measurements .",
    "our two main results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "we find that at @xmath0 , early - type galaxies exhibit a stronger clustering strength than late - type galaxies on scales from @xmath125@xmath64 mpcto @xmath99@xmath64 mpc .",
    "2 .   comparing our results to those for the sdss for galaxies with comparable luminosities , shows that while the relative difference in clustering between early and late morphological classes seems to increase with cosmic time on scales smaller than a few @xmath64 mpc , the large - scale difference does not evolve significantly since @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that a large fraction of early - type galaxies were already formed in intermediate and dense environments at this epoch .",
    "the observed difference in shape of the correlation function that we observe for early- and late - type galaxies , can be interpreted within the framework of halo occupation distribution models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these models ,",
    "the galaxy correlation function is the sum of two contributions , one dominating the small scales that characterises the clustering of galaxies inside haloes ( 1-halo term ) , and a large - scale contribution , which characterises the clustering of galaxies belonging to different haloes ( 2-halo term ) .",
    "the prominence of the 1-halo term observed for early - type galaxies , i.e. the enhancement of the observed correlation function on scales smaller than or of the order of the typical halo radius ( @xmath108@xmath64 mpc ) , implies that these galaxies are on average hosted by massive haloes with larger virial radii in dense environments @xcite .",
    "the weaker but steeper 1-halo term of late - type galaxies indicates that these galaxies instead may be hosted on average by less massive haloes inhabiting low - density environments .",
    "this trend is qualitatively consistent with @xmath5 measurements of the clustering of red and blue galaxies , that dominate respectively the early- and late - type populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our work is complementary to those of @xcite and @xcite who study within the same sample , the evolution of the fraction of early and late morphological types with environment , as defined either by the continuous overdensity field or group / field environments , respectively .",
    "the measurements presented here are consistent with the picture emerging from these works . in particular",
    ", @xcite observed a flattening in the morphology - density relation with increasing redshift at fixed luminosity , extending to morphology similar evolutionary trends observed in the colour- and spectral - type - density relations @xcite .",
    "the finding that early- and late - type galaxies tend to have increasingly similar probabilities of populating high - density / group and low - density / field environments with increasing redshift , is qualitatively consistent with the evolution in the morphological dependence of clustering discussed here , where we find a corresponding decrease in the relative small - scale clustering of early- to late - type galaxies .",
    "the mass and environmental physical processes play an important role in shaping the morphology - density relation and its evolution with cosmic time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is found that mass has a dominant contribution at @xmath4 in particular for relatively bright luminosity - selected sample @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the local universe , one finds that only a part of this relation can be attributed to the variation in the stellar - mass function with environment , with the dense environment - related processes becoming more important @xcite .",
    "our results corroborate this evolutionary picture .",
    "while the large - scale shape of the relative bias has remained constant since @xmath4 , the small - scale shape exhibits a significant evolution .",
    "this is due to an increase in the number of small - scale early - type pairs with cosmic time , as a result of that of the relative contribution of environmental physical processes in transforming early- to late - type galaxies , especially in dense environments .",
