    "<S> within the framework of imqmd05 , we study several isospin sensitive observables , such as dr(n / p ) ratios , isospin transport ratio ( isospin diffusion ) , yield ratios for lcps between the projectile region and mid - rapidity region for the reaction systems ni+ni , zn+zn , sn+sn at low - intermediate energies . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that those observables are sensitive to the density dependence of symmetry energy , and also depend on the cluster formation mechanism . by comparing these calculations to the data , </S>",
    "<S> the information of the symmetry energy and reaction mechanism is obtained . </S>"
