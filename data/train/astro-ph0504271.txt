    "hence , the products of extraterrestrial organic chemistry could , in principle , allow a prebiotic chemistry , similar to which occurred on earth , to begin throughout the galaxy .",
    "the dominant molecular composition of cometary ices is quite similar to that observed in the gas and ices around _ massive _ protostars ( ehrenfreund & charnley 2000 ) .",
    "however , to accurately make a connection between interstellar organics and the chemicals initially available to the comet - forming disks around sun - like stars , high angular - resolution spectral observations of _ low - mass _ protostars are necessary .",

    "millimeter and submillimeter line surveys using single - dish telescopes have found many organic molecules in i16293 , including ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath0cn , hc@xmath0n and h@xmath1co , and suggested the existence of an inner ( @xmath310 ) hot region of dense gas @xcite . however , molecular species such as hcooh , ch@xmath0cho , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , normally present in the hot molecular cores ( hmcs ) associated with massive protostars , were not detected . because emission from the circumstellar disks was considered too dilute in their 20  beam",

    "all the _ hot core _ interpretations were derived from single - dish observations which suffered from insufficient angular resolution . the precise nature of the i16293 hot core could therefore not be determined until very recently . by conducting arcsecond - resolution submillimeter interferometric observations , with the detections of complex organic molecules ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath1chcn and hcooch@xmath0 , @xcite first uncovered the existence of two , rather than one , compact _ hot molecular cores _ associated with each of the protobinary components , and also evident from their thermal dust emission .",

    "however , in the case of low - mass protostars like i16293 , where the total bolometric luminosity is only about 30 - 40 @xmath30 @xcite , it was thought that the surrounding dust could not be heated sufficiently to create a hot core environment , except in the innermost 100 au @xcite .",

    "1(f ) ) 46@xmath33@xmath1246@xmath34 , with their respective lower energy levels occurring 1050 k , 1660 k and 1800 k above ground , clearly demonstrates that the innermost regions of the two protostellar cores are very hot .",
    "the vibrationally excited transitions are likely to be maintained by far - infrared pumping .",
    "these high - resolution spectral images clearly provide further strong observational evidence for the existence of low - mass hot cores similar to the hmcs found in massive star - forming regions .",
    "i16293 is a region full of dynamic activity , such as double bipolar outflows , a surrounding in - fall cloud and a circumbinary envelope , which makes an unambiguous kinematic interpretation difficult .",
    "thus , to kinematically separate the inner hot cores from other gas motions in the region , observations of optically thin molecular emission of a high - density tracer would be ideal .",
    "hc@xmath4n is a rare isotope of the high - density tracer hcn , thus emission of hc@xmath4n is most likely to be optically thin which would trace the densest regions in i16293 and , in principle , better avoid any potential contamination from the ambient cloud and/or gas outflows . by examining the velocity channel maps of the hc@xmath4n j=4 - 3 emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , molecular gas motion is apparent .",
    "this can be seen in moving across the center position of i16293a , from the direction south - southwest at higher velocities ( v@xmath35 @xmath5 11 to 5 km s@xmath26 ) to the north - northeast at lower velocities ( v@xmath35 @xmath5 3 to -3 km s@xmath26 ) .",
    "likewise , oc@xmath24s and hcn ( @xmath23=1 ) channel maps ( not shown here ) also show a velocity gradient toward i16293a at a position angle ( pa , measured from the north to the east counterclockwise ) between 10@xmath6  and 30@xmath6 , similar to that of hc@xmath4n .    a position - velocity cut centered at i16293a and a pa = 10@xmath6   is shown in fig .",
    "two distinguished velocity components , with their peak - emission positions separated by @xmath53.0 km s@xmath26 in velocity and @xmath50.4  ( @xmath560 au ) in position , are immediately visible . by modeling the kinematic structure of i16293a thus revealed , we find it can be fitted nicely by a rotating keplerian disk inclined @xmath530@xmath6  with respect to the sky ( an inclination angle @xmath36 = @xmath530@xmath6 , fig .  [ fig4 ] ) ; here a mass of 0.49 m@xmath8 for the central protostar @xcite and a systemic velocity of 3.7 km s@xmath26 are adopted for the model . note that in the channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the orientation of the unresolved i16293a image of hc@xmath4n emission is largely a result of beam convolution , and is not the true orientation of the disk which is tilted @xmath510@xmath6  east of the north . the i16293a circumstellar disk is distinct from the circumbinary disk previously reported in the literature .",
    "our finding is consistent with the subarcsecond continuum images of i16293a @xcite which also show a north - south elongated structure off slightly to the east .",
    "this rotating disk scenario is further supported by more recent observations of the double bipolar outflows emanating from the i16293 star - forming core @xcite ; the `` e - w outflow '' of the two outflows is in fact in the direction perpendicular to the i16293a circumstellar disk . since the two hc@xmath4n emission peaks in the position - velocity diagram is only 0.4  or 60 au apart , it is reasonable to believe that most of the molecular gas in the disk resides at a distance merely 30 au from the central protostar .",
    "this raises the distinct possibility that the rotating disk of i16293a is really a protoplanetary disk .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] lists the beam - averaged molecule column densities ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and derived fractional abundances ( i.e. @xmath39 ) in both hot corinos . for completeness",
    ", table  [ tbl-3 ] lists the column densities and fractional abundances of those molecules reported by @xcite .",
    "column densities were derived assuming optically thin lines in local thermodynamic equilibrium and were measured at the peak emission positions of each integrated spectral line .",
    "this approach is sufficient only for obtaining first - order estimates since excitation temperatures for individual molecules could differ , and some lines may have non - trivial optical depths . because of the very high gas density of @xmath40 @xcite , gas and dust are expected to be thermally well - coupled so an excitation temperature @xmath41 @xmath42  @xmath43 = 100 k was adopted @xcite , except for molecular transitions with energy levels above 500 cm@xmath26 ( @xmath16  700 k ) where @xmath41 = 300 k was used @xcite .",
    "in addition , we assume the vibrational excitation temperature is similar to the rotational excitation temperature with @xmath41(vib ) @xmath42  @xmath41(rot ) . here",
    "a gas column density @xmath45 @xmath46 @xcite was adopted for both corinos .",
    "the derived fractional abundances and relative column densities are in good agreement with the values observed within a similar frequency range ( 330 - 355 ghz ) for the orion kl and sgr b2(m ) massive hmcs @xcite . for the rare isotopes detected ,",
    "we find so@xmath1/@xmath24so@xmath1 @xmath42 10 and hcn(gnd)/hc@xmath4n @xmath42 8@xmath1229 , also in general agreement with hmc values @xcite .    when compared to some previous single - dish observations toward i16293 @xcite , many molecular abundances derived using the smaller sma beam ( so",
    ", so@xmath1 , h@xmath1cs and c@xmath1h@xmath2cn ) are higher in general .",
    "this indicates that the observed molecular emission is mainly from the compact cores ( or disks ) , and explains why so , so@xmath1 and h@xmath1cs abundances derived from modeling higher energy transitions @xcite in the _ inner _",
    "i16293 core show good agreement with our values .",
    "the ground 4@xmath123 hcn emission toward i16293 is extended and diffuse @xcite .",
    "the fact that the abundance derived from the vibrational bending state hcn is an order of magnitude higher than the ground hcn toward i16293a suggests more hcn resides in the compact protostellar disk of i16293a .",
    "the high abundances of organic molecules found in both hot corinos can be best explained by icy mantle evaporation @xcite .",
    "the abundances derived by us for most of those molecules observed in both sources are within a factor of two of each other , as to be expected if both cores collapsed from the same cloud material .",
    "there are , however , marked compositional differences between i16293a and i16293b .",
    "the nondetection of so emission toward i16293b can not be due to excitation ; it is more likely due to an actual chemical difference since an even higher excitation line of so@xmath1 is seen in i16293b .",
    "similarly , @xcite did not detect so in i16293b though they also observed it in i16293a .",
    "although the vibrationally excited lines of so and so@xmath1 can still be populated by an excitation temperature of @xmath5100 k , it is probable that these molecular lines actually arise well within the inner hot cores , perhaps in circumstellar disks . @xcite",
    "previously concluded that vibrationally excited cs emission in i16293 emanated from gas with @xmath47  1000 k , and at densities such that the only likely environment was in shocks within the protostellar disk . @xcite also suggested a possible existence of shocked zones in the innermost 100 au .",
    "complete conversion of so to so@xmath1 in shock waves could explain the lack of so in i16293b .",
    "apart from the striking anticorrelations in the presence of c@xmath1h@xmath2cn and c@xmath1h@xmath2oh between i16293a and i16293b , there appears to be no dichotomy between n - containing and o - containing organic molecules similar to that found in massive star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "however , these anticorrelations could pose problems for grain chemistry scheme based on h atom additions .",
    "together with organic molecules reported previously in @xcite , these posit that hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath1chcn are precursors of c@xmath1h@xmath2cn , and that ch@xmath1co is a possible precursor of c@xmath1h@xmath2oh @xcite .",
    "the hc@xmath0n / ch@xmath1chcn ratios in both sources are similar but c@xmath1h@xmath2cn is only detected in i16293b , and at a large abundance .",
    "ethanol is only detected in i16293a but ketene , its putative precursor in some grain - surface reaction schemes @xcite , is not .",
    "low - level emission from ch@xmath1co and c@xmath1h@xmath2cn was seen in channel maps of i16293a , as was c@xmath1h@xmath2oh emission in i16293b .",
    "nevertheless the observations suggest that these molecules are chemically differentiated between the two sources .",
    "this apparent anticorrelation between precursors and end products in i16293a and i16293b , as well as the relative abundances of the species involved in the surface chemistry , may eventually allow us to constrain theories of grain surface chemistry .",
    "for example , reduction of ketene to ethanol via acetaldehyde ( @xmath48 ) is is one possible pathway ( charnley 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , reduction and oxidation of acetylene can produce both acetaldehyde and ethanol , as well as ethylene oxide and vinyl alcohol ( charnley 2004 ) .",
    "our observations suggest that the latter pathway may have dominated in the prestellar phase of i16293 and hence that a similar differentiation in the @xmath48 and @xmath49-c@xmath1h@xmath50co abundances should exist between i16293a and i16293b .",
    "more observations , as well as better excitation and abundance determinations are necessary to pursue this avenue of research .    indeed , a fundamental issue is to determine which of the organic molecules found in hmcs and hot corinos actually do originate in grain - surface chemistry , or whether post - evaporative production in the hot gas is necessary ( charnley et al .",
    "ion - molecule production of methyl formate , @xmath51 , and of dimethyl ether , @xmath52 , has been proposed and involves , respectively , methyl cation transfer from protonated methanol to formaldehyde and methanol @xcite .",
    "when the methanol and formaldehyde molecules are injected from grain surfaces , these reaction pathways can reproduce the @xmath52 and @xmath51 abundances observed in hmcs @xcite . however , single - dish observations of the i16293 core led cazaux et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to proclaim that all organics were produced on grain surfaces .",
    "the abundances of o - containing molecules derived by cazaux et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were almost all much higher than found elsewhere and this , when compared to the methanol abundance measured by @xcite , led these authors to conclude that all the o - containing molecules , particularly methyl formate and dimethyl ether , were formed on grains .",
    "it is extremely dangerous to make this generalization for several reasons .",
    "first , cazaux et al . ( 2003 ) argued that , because the observed @xmath51/@xmath53 is close to unity in i16293 , the above gas phase production could be ruled out .",
    "in the case of @xmath51 , ion - molecule experiments _ do show _ that reaction of @xmath54 with @xmath55 does not produce protonated methyl formate , and so an origin in grain - surface reactions or other ion - molecule reactions , perhaps involving hcooh , is more likely @xcite . on the other hand , it has been experimentally verified that gas phase self - methylation of methanol will lead to @xmath52 . a second , and more serious",
    ", problem lies in the fact that cazaux et al .",
    "constructed their @xmath51/@xmath53 ratio using abundances from two different observations .",
    "fractional abundances derived by @xcite were derived , as here , using a gas column density of @xmath56 @xmath46 , whereas cazaux et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used @xmath57 @xmath46 .",
    "this explains why the abundances derived by cazaux et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are so high .",
    "third , interferometric observations of @xmath51 in both i16293a and i16293b show that its emission comes from the two hot corinos .",
    "abundances derived using more realistic ( i.e. larger ) values of @xmath58 @xmath46 ) lead to @xmath51 and @xmath52 abundances ( @xmath59 ) , and ratios relative to @xmath53 ( @xmath60 ) , that are more in accord with those found elsewhere ( this work ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on interferometry of @xmath51 and @xmath61 emission in both the i16293 hot corinos , @xcite also concluded that all the organic molecules were evaporated products of grain - surface chemistry .",
    "while a gas phase origin for @xmath51 can not yet be ruled out , @xmath61 , like @xmath52 , can be formed easily in hot gas @xcite .    in conclusion , the issues raised above show that @xmath51 is _ not _ a good molecule to discriminate between a global gas - phase or grain - surface origin for all other molecules . nevertheless , it is almost certain that some molecules , particularly @xmath52 , are produced through ion - molecule reactions .",
    "similarly , it is also quite certain that some organic compounds seen in i16293 , those that do not appear to have a viable gas - phase production chemistry , are formed solely on grains : hcooh , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , hnco , @xmath64 , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "it is important to try and estimate the relative evolutionary state of the i16293 sources , as this may provide clues to the chemistry that occurred just prior to the formation of the protosolar nebula . @xcite",
    "have suggested that , whereas i16293a is a class 0 object , i16293b is a t tauri star and consequently more evolved .",
    "a large degree of deuterium fractionation is observed toward i16293 @xcite and the ch@xmath1chcn / ch@xmath1cdcn ratios found here ( @xmath53 in i16293a and @xmath54 in i16293b ) suggest both sources are in an early phase of chemical evolution .",
    "it is evident that the spectral - peak and integrated - line intensities are in general stronger toward i16293a which may imply i16293a is warmer and hence the more evolved of the two .",
    "@xmath49-c@xmath0h@xmath1 , ch@xmath1co and c@xmath1h@xmath2cn are only detected in i16293b and , as their fractional abundances are higher than in the more evolved hmcs ( this work ; @xcite ) , this may also be a further indication that i16293b is the less evolved of the two . on the other hand , gas - phase chemical evolution driven by prompt evaporation of mantle molecules could allow daughter / parent abundance ratios to be used for estimating the relative post - evaporative ages of hmcs @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath52/@xmath62 ratios in i16293a ( 0.006 ) and i16293b ( 0.016 ) appear to indicate that , in fact , i16293b is the more evolved ; assuming that the higher methanol abundance of i16293a is representative of that originally injected into both hot corinos .",
    "clearly , given the caveats surrounding the abundance determinations , it may be premature to make definitive estimates of chemical age until more secure values are available .",
    "together with previous high - resolution sma studies , a rich organic inventory of large organic molecules such as hc@xmath0n , ch@xmath1co , ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath1chcn , hcooch@xmath0 , ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1o , c@xmath1h@xmath2oh and c@xmath1h@xmath2cn is revealed in low - mass hot corinos . by observing the optically thin hc@xmath4n emission , we find i16293a is in fact a rotating circumstellar disk distinct from the circumbinary disk , lying along the north - south direction with a position angle @xmath510@xmath6  to the east , and is inclined @xmath530@xmath6  to the sky .",
    "hence there is potentially a strong link between interstellar organics and prebiotic chemistry in protostellar disks @xcite .",
    "there are several chemical similarites between the compositions of i16293a and i16293b , however , c@xmath1h@xmath2cn , ch@xmath1co and c@xmath1h@xmath2oh appear to be strongly differentiated between the cores .",
    "the vibrational excitation observed in so and so@xmath1 suggests an active shock chemistry in protostellar disks .",

    "our observations strengthen the chemical connection between dark clouds , massive star - forming regions and solar - type hot corinos",
