    "this concludes the proof of theorem  [ thm : cable ] in case  3 .",
    "let @xmath249 be a legendrian @xmath201cable link in @xmath21 with @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and the unknotted component @xmath207 having @xmath252 . according to ( * ? ? ? * lemma  4.6 ) , the maximal thurston ",

    "so a sufficiently high destabilisation of @xmath261 in @xmath262 gives a legendrian @xmath201cable link which is not legendrian isotopic to the image of a legendrian @xmath125cable link in  @xmath2 .",

    "then , by kanda s theorem , @xmath279    the following argument is analogous to cases 2 and  3 , except that the protagonist is now @xmath276 in place of  @xmath182 .",

    "the neighbourhood in the previous construction can be chosen arbitrarily small , so we may assume that @xmath276 sits in the interior of  @xmath126 .",

    "* this corresponds to case  3(b2 ) of  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath286 , we are in subcase 3(b2-iii ) ; if @xmath287 , in subcase 3(b2-ii ) . here",
    "we have @xmath288 , hence @xmath289 .",
    "there are several legendrian realisations of this maximal @xmath32 , distinguished by @xmath290 .",
    "all these realisations , as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) , live in @xmath196 in such a way that we may regard them as links in  @xmath2 .",
    "this yields @xmath291 . in order to establish a one - to - one correspondence between legendrian @xmath125cable links in @xmath2 and @xmath201cable links in  @xmath21",
    ", we need to show the following :    * in a @xmath201cable link in @xmath196 with non - maximal @xmath292 , the component @xmath261 can be destabilised inside @xmath196 . * two @xmath201cable links in @xmath196 with maximal @xmath292 and the same classical invariants are legendrian isotopic inside @xmath196 . *",
    "the relation between stabilisations with the same classical invariants coming from links with @xmath293 but different rotation numbers are as described in lemmata 4.20 and 4.21 of  @xcite , respectively .    the first point we can settle directly in @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath92 is a @xmath125cable link with @xmath294 , we find a convex standardly embedded torus @xmath126 on which @xmath97 sits .",
    "if the actual geometric intersection number between @xmath97 and the dividing set @xmath108 of @xmath126 is larger than the minimal one possible , there exists a bypass for @xmath97 on @xmath126 , and we can destabilise  @xmath97 . thus , we may assume that @xmath126 is in standard form of slope @xmath295 , and the non - maximality of @xmath133 then forces @xmath296 .",

    "* lemma  4.14 ) .",
    "the proof of that lemma goes through in @xmath196 , as can be seen by thinking of @xmath21 as being composed of a union of four pieces : a standard neighbourhood of @xmath34 with boundary  @xmath276 , a thickened torus between @xmath276 and  @xmath126 ( on which @xmath97 sits ) , a thickened torus between @xmath126 and @xmath182 , and a standard neighbourhood of  @xmath42 .    for @xmath286",
    ", this point can not be settled with a simple reference to  @xcite , for this is exactly the situation that necessitated the discussion in section  [ section : s3 ] .",
    "that argument allows us to assume that our cable link sits in the interior of a solid torus @xmath138 with convex boundary having two dividing curves of slope @xmath302 .",
    "( the reduction of the number of dividing curves on @xmath140 to @xmath141 by using meridional discs in the complement also works in @xmath303 , because we can always choose the bypasses in such a way that we do not move across @xmath42 in order to effect the destabilisation . )    by ` unwinding ' this solid torus @xmath138 as in section  [ section : s3 ] , we may identify @xmath92 with a link @xmath257 in @xmath2 topologically isotopic to @xmath0 , with @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "thus , if @xmath306 , then this link is determined by its classical invariants even inside  @xmath138 . if @xmath307 , then @xmath257 is legendrian isotopic to @xmath0 or @xmath3 , and in particular a @xmath141copy .",
    "so @xmath92 is likewise a @xmath141copy , but now of a stabilised knot . in that case , it is easy to see that permutation is possible by a legendrian isotopy , see  ( * ? ? ?",
