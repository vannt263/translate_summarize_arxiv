    "the formation and evolution of galactic discs in a universe dominated by dark matter poses great challenges that still need to be solved . for instance , only recently grand design discs such as that of the milky way have been produced in hydrodynamical simulations with a better treatment of multiple gas phases and feedback ( scannapieco et al . , 2006 ) and with the hybrid lagrangian cell code arepo ( springel , 2010 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is difficult to produce large enough samples of galaxies with these codes to make statistical comparisons with galaxy samples extracted from large surveys such as the sloan digital survey ( york et al . , 2000 ) due to the large computational resources required for this in comparison to simulations that only follow dark matter ( see for instance bower , benson & crain , 2012 ) .    in recent years , these problems have been partially solved by different approaches such as ( i ) using resimulations of chosen haloes in large dark matter only simulations to much higher resolutions , as is the case of the aquarius simulations ( springel et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "these haloes resemble our own milky way@xmath2s ( mw ) , and simulations of galaxies within these are expected to reproduce the large disc of the mw at least in some cases .",
    "these simulations have been extensively analyzed and different hydrodynamical codes have been run using the aquarius simulations ( the aquila project , scannapieco et al . , 2012 ) , and in some cases their results are promising showing grand - design spiral galaxies in a fraction of the haloes ( marinacci , pakmor & springel , 2013 ) .",
    "( ii ) resimulating larger portions of the millennium simulation ( springel et al . 2005 ) corresponding to different environments , of low , average and high matter density ; this is the case of the gimic project ( galaxies - intergalactic medium interaction calculation , crain et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "however , it turned out that the resulting stellar mass function of the gimic galaxy population is not compatible with the observed one ( bower , benson & crain , 2012 ) .",
    "the limitation of this approach is evident since due to the high computational demand of this project , it was not possible to re - run it many times with changing parameters until the resulting galaxy population matched the observed one .",
    "( iii ) currently , the eagle project ( evolution of galaxies and their environment , bower , benson & crain , 2012 ) seems the most promising way to obtain fully hydrodynamical simulations of a galaxy population with the right stellar mass function , that is , with a reasonable galaxy population in which each galaxy has evolved embedded in a dark matter halo , with all the associated physical effects , including those involved in the formation and evolution of galactic discs .     still , even though cosmological volumes are being simulated using reasonable hydrodynamics , in some cases there are still issues regarding the resulting efficiency of early star formation , which can be higher than observed ( e.g. powell et al . , 2011 ,",
    "brook et al . , 2011 , nagamine 2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "the proposed solution to this appears to come from adopting higher resolution and introducing additional sources of feedback ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    ", 2011 , tasker 2011 , kannan et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "another solution to the problem of making large galaxy samples from simulations comes from semi - analytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "these models are necessarily extremely simplified versions of the hydro simulations , since a small set of simple equations describes the evolution of , for instance , an entire gas phase in a galaxy ( kauffmann et al . , 1999 , cole et al .",
    ", 2000 , see also the reviews by baugh , 2006 , benson , 2010 , silk & mammon , 2012 ) ; this is , however , the reason why it is feasible to generate large galaxy populations with these models . in particular , the process of star formation is generally modeled according to the observed proportionality between star formation rate and projected gas density ( e.g. kennicut , 1998 ) .",
    "the proportionality constant involves an efficiency parameter , which is fixed so as to fit the observed z = 0 galaxy luminosity function , among other properties .",
    "notice that the early over - efficiency of star formation affecting some hydrodynamical simulations is therefore not present in semi - analytic models , since they directly fix the efficiency of star formation by reproducing the observed total mass in stars at @xmath1 .",
    "the ingredients involved in the star formation process in semi - analytics are the disc dynamical time and the mass of cold gas contained in the disc ( e.g. cole et al .",
    ", 2000 , croton et al . , 2006 , lagos , cora & padilla , 2008 , among others ) .",
    "of the two , the dynamical time is the most delicate in the sense that it depends strongly on the size of the disc , and this is a challenging quantity as it involves many complicated evolutionary processes .",
    "for instance , we need to know the angular momentum of the disc and which is the influence of the bulge in its final size . practical answers to these questions were given by mo , mao & white ( 1998 , mmw ) , by studying the behaviour of discs in numerical simulations .",
    "for relaxed haloes , they were able to provide formulae for the typical disc size that depend on the dark matter halo mass , its specific angular momentum , @xmath3 , the fraction of mass residing in the disc , and the fraction of mass in the bulge .    however , haloes acquire mass continuously , either in a smooth way or via mergers , and in both cases , the angular momentum of the halo suffers slews and flips , some of them small but others as high as @xmath4 degrees or even more .",
    "bett & frenk ( 2012 ) studied the frequency of flips in dark matter only simulations .",
    "they showed that flips are more likely in mergers , but that they still occur when there is smooth accretion .",
    "if the hot gas is relaxed within the dark matter halo , as it cools it is highly likely that the disc sitting in the center will have a different angular momentum .",
    "analysing the gimic galaxies , sales et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that this effect can destroy discs completely , making their life more episodic than is usually obtained in semi - analytic models , where unless a merger or a disc instability takes place , the disc keeps growing ( on average ) . in the same line , aumer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find that the last misaligned accretion influences the disc fraction of a galaxy .",
    "other studies of disc galaxies show the complex physics of discs .",
    "saha & naab ( 2013 ) find that the alignment of the angular momentum direction of the disc and halo produce stronger bars , which in principle could suggest that not even aligned discs are guaranteed to survive long . in a more cautious note ,",
    "bird et al .",
    "( 2013 ) analysed the eris ensemble of resimulated haloes ( guedes et al . , 2011 ) , and point out that initial conditions have an important influence on the final state of the disc of a galaxy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact on the properties of galactic discs of the angular momentum slews and flips suffered by dark matter halos using the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation sag ( cora , 2006 ; lagos , cora & padilla , 2008 ; lagos , padilla & cora , 2009a ; tecce et al .",
    "although the version of the model described in tecce et al . ( 2010 ) , to which we will refer as the base model , makes full use of the mmw formulae to determine disc sizes , it does not take into account the change of the angular momentum of the discs as they accrete matter . in this paper",
    "we will improve upon this recipe by taking this effect into account , to some degree , developing a new version of this model that we will refer to as the flip model .",
    "for this purpose , we construct a statistics of angular momentum slews using the millennium ii simulation ( boylan - kolchin et al . , 2009 ) and , with the aid of a monte - carlo simulation , apply slews in the discs of the semi - analytic galaxies .",
    "the resulting properties of galactic discs impact directly the frequency of disc instability events suffered by a galaxy , in which the disc is transferred to the galactic bulge with all the cold gas available being consumed in a starburst .",
    "the chance of bursts increases with the amplitude of the flip of the angular momentum of the discs , which makes us implement one additional modification to our model regarding the triggering of starbursts during galaxy mergers . instead of using mass ratios of the merging galaxies to classify them as major mergers with starburst or minor mergers with and without starbursts , as is considered in the base model ,",
    "we now apply the disc instability criterion to the remnant galaxy .",
    "one of the possible consequences of introducing angular momentum flips in galaxy discs in the model is that it could affect the rate at which star formation occurs at high redshift .",
    "since a few years back there has been some tension between the observed abundance of massive galaxies at high redshift and those predicted by semi - analytic models ( e.g. de lucia et al .",
    "several observational studies pointed at larger populations of high stellar mass galaxies than predicted ( e.g. prez - gonzlez et al .",
    ", 2008 , ferreras et al . , 2009 ) , but with the advent of mid - infrared imaging of high redshift galaxies , this situation was somewhat alleviated , as shown by marchesini et al .",
    "they point out that if dusty templates are included in the analysis of photometric samples of galaxies with mid - ir coverage , then the tension with the models is reduced . with an increased star formation activity at high redshifts ,",
    "our new model could help to reduce even further this controversy .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : flips ] we present the statistics on angular momentum slews extracted from the millennium ii simulation ( boylan - kolchin et al . , 2009 ) , and we briefly describe the aspects of the semi - analytic model relevant to the present study and the improvements introduced regarding the slews of dark matter angular momentum ; section [ sec : di ] shows the effects of these specific changes on the typical lifetimes of discs in galaxies .",
    "section [ sec : mergers ] shows how with this new model we can follow bursts in mergers using only the disc instability criterion instead of mass ratios as in the base model . in section [ sec : results ]",

    "sag is run on subhalo merger trees extracted from a dark - matter only n - body simulation .",
    "this simulation is based on the standard @xmath9cdm scenario , characterized by the cosmological parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , according to the wmap7 cosmology ( jarosik et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "the simulation was run using gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) using @xmath16 particles in a cubic box of comoving sidelength @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce angular momentum slews and flips that will directly affect the galaxy discs .",
    "one simple way to do this is to follow the angular momentum vector of the dark matter halo which changes with time , and assume that the hot gas always carries it , even when cooling down to top up the cold gas supply of the disc .",
    "the incoming cold gas brings angular momentum parallel to that of the halo , but if the halo changed its spin with respect to the time when the disc was formed , the cooling gas will have a different angular momentum than the disc . using mass weighted averages of the angular momenta of the incoming cold gas and the galaxy disc , lagos ,",
    "padilla & cora ( 2009a ) followed the changes in the angular momentum of the galaxy disc .",
    "they went even further and extended this to the spin of the black hole ( see also lagos et al .",
    ", 2011 , and guo et al . , 2011 )",
    ".    however , the direction of the angular momentum of haloes is difficult to measure accurately ; for haloes with less than @xmath18 particles the direction is subject to large contributions from numerical noise ( e.g. bett & frenk , 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , the changes in the direction of the angular momentum of haloes in this case is larger than it would be if the haloes were followed with higher resolution . in our case , therefore , we either need to smooth this effect to some degree ( as was done in lagos , padilla & cora , 2009a ) , or use a statistical measurement of the typical angular momentum flips of haloes to apply it to a semi - analytic model .",
    "we opt for the latter , for which the first step is to obtain a full statistical distribution of flips from a numerical simulation with enough resolution so that the full dynamical range of haloes populated by sag is covered by our statistics .",
    "the millennium ii simulation ( boylan - kolchin et al . ,",
    "2009 ) provides us with subhaloes of @xmath19h@xmath20 with more than @xmath18 particles each , fulfilling this requirement .",
    "we will use subhaloes instead of haloes from the start , to avoid the influence in the measured angular momentum from other substructures . this way",
    "satellites will slew according to the angular momentum of their host substructures and not of their host halo as a whole .",
    "furthermore , central galaxies are this way unaffected by the changes in the angular momentum of their satellites , which should not contribute to the central galaxy@xmath2s angular momentum until the event of a merger .",
    "figure [ fig : angmom ] shows the probability distributions for the cosine of the angle between the initial and final angular momentum ( @xmath21 ) of subhaloes that suffer changes in their mass by the relative amount indicated in the key ( these relative mass ranges are chosen as examples , the actual statistics cover a wide range of mass accretion ranging up to @xmath22 ) .",
    "these angular momentum changes are commonly referred to as slews or flips .",
    "different line types correspond to whether the increase in mass was by a merger ( dashed lines ) or smooth accretion ( solid lines ) .",
    "the statistics for smooth accretion are obtained analysing subhaloes that have not suffered mergers in consecutive snapshots of the simulation . to construct this for the case of mergers ,",
    "we take only subhaloes that are the result of at least one merger since the previous snapshot and measure their flips . in the case when the merged subhalo mass is larger than the sum of its progenitor masses , we assume that the excess mass came from smooth accretion . in this case",
    "we lower the amplitude of the flip from mergers using the statistics for smooth accretion which are measured first . only after this correction",
    "is made we use it for the statistics of mergers .",
    "the upper solid ( dashed ) line indicates that a higher relative mass accretion ( merger ) increases the chances of a given angular momentum flip .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    our application of the probability of slews and flips as a way to follow the evolution of the angular momentum of semi - analytic galaxy discs is simple . in each snapshot of the simulation",
    ", we calculate the fractional increase in the galaxy disc mass .",
    "we then assign a disc angular momentum flip following the statistical distributions measured from the millennium ii subhaloes , assuming that the same slews or flips are suffered by the baryons in their centres .    however , the most important assumption is that when the disc suffers a flip that amounts to an angle @xmath21 , between the  old \" and  new \" angular momenta , this lowers the specific angular momentum of the disc by the following amount , @xmath23    the angle @xmath21 accumulates successive slews suffered by an individual disc in a statistical way . as a result ,",
    "the specific angular momentum of the disc is generally lower than that of the halo at the time the disc formed , and continues to decrease its value as more accretion takes place .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with recent findings that point to lower specific angular momentum for galaxies in comparison to that of dark matter haloes ( e.g. dutton & van den bosch , 2012 ) .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations and semi - analytic models suffer from opposite problems .",
    "it has been pointed out that there is a lack of enough angular momentum to form discs in hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. mo , mao & white , 1998 , bullock et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "recently , robertson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that this can be overcome in cosmological scenarios by taking into account the effect of early merging and appropriate feedback mechanisms ( see also maller & dekel , 2002 , donghia & burkert , 2004 , vitvitska et al .",
    "on the other hand , these problems are the opposite in semi - analytic models , where it is usually assumed that the specific angular momentum of the disc equals ( e.g. tecce et al . , 2010 ) or is even higher than that of the dark - matter halo ( berry et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this is done because the prescriptions used in these models are not able to follow any of the details of angular momentum and feedback energy transfer . by assuming these equalities ,",
    "semi - analytic models adopt constant specific angular momenta for discs .",
    "however , several works analysing hydrodynamical simulations ( sales et al . , 2012 , saha & naab , 2013 , aumer et al . , 2013 ) find that the infall of misaligned material tends to disfavour the survival of the disc whose destruction could be the result of a change in the properties of the disc such as its spin .",
    "our proposed loss of specific angular momentum of discs is designed to take this effect into account to some degree , as it entails an inhibition of growth of the disc angular momentum due to slews and flips .",
    "the initial specific angular momentum of a disc is exactly that of its host halo as it forms , @xmath24 .",
    "afterward , successive accretion events make the specific angular momentum , @xmath25 , smaller with respect to its initial value ( without necessarily making the disc actually lose angular momentum ) .",
    "we define @xmath26 the value of @xmath27 diminishes with each accretion event , but in the case of a merger induced burst of star formation or disc instability , the disc disappears and , therefore , @xmath27 is reset to @xmath28 .",
    "only after one halo dynamical time has passed the value of @xmath27 is allowed to vary again .",
    "we remark that in this implementation we do not follow the changes in amplitude of @xmath3 suffered by the host dark matter structure ; we only use its value as a new disc forms as in cora ( 2006 ) and lagos , cora & padilla ( 2008 ) . as guo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) pointed out , if the disc follows the changes of the specific angular momentum of the dark matter its properties will suffer sudden jumps due to the numerical errors in determining this quantity using few dark matter particles .",
    "we also point out that on average the galaxy population will show a smoothly raising amplitude of angular momentum of discs , but the effect of the slews and flips on the discs specific angular momentum will change its rate of growth .",
    "notice that even though the amplitude of the dimensionless spin parameter of a disc diminishes , the disc itself slews the direction around which it is spinning by an angle given by the flips distribution measured for the dark matter .",
    "this allows us to reproduce , qualitatively , previous well - known results where discs show changes ( sometimes important ones ) in their direction of spin as a result of mass accretion ( e.g. shen & sellwood , 2006 ) .",
    "also , as is shown in figure [ fig : angmom ] , the distribution of the cosine of angle of flips / slews indicates that an accretion of equal relative mass produces small slews more frequently than actual angular momentum flips .",
    "we also note that our formalism does not directly take into account the changes of angular momentum of discs due to external torques which can produce tell tale signs in discs such as warps ( e.g. garcia - ruiz , kuijken & dubinski , 2002 , dubinski & chakrabarty , 2009 ) , but these processes do not often entail a loss of angular momentum and therefore , to first order , do not need to be included in our modeling .",
    "another point to note is that we treat the gas disc as a single object and do not take into account its possible interaction with the stellar disc , or the existence of counter - rotating stars , or stellar warps and other features in the distribution of stars ( algorry et al . , 2013 ,",
    "bois et al . , 2011 , naab et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "our modeling should include this mechanism for angular momentum transfer between gas and stars , but its effect should be smaller than that coming from the much more frequent accretion events ( e.g. algorry et al .",
    "2013 ) , and we therefore defer its treatment to future work .",
    "the main motivation behind our implementation comes from the results from hydrodynamical simulations that show that the presence of a disc in a galaxy is favoured by a lack of infall of material coming with a misaligned angular momentum ( e.g. sales et al .",
    ", 2012 , saha & naab , 2013 , aumer et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : etadisk ] shows the change in the value of @xmath27 as a function of redshift for galaxies of different present - day stellar masses , as indicated in the key .",
    "as can be seen , more massive galaxies today are tending to @xmath29 values , since their evolution consists of a decreasing number of important accretion events .",
    "however , at high redshifts , when their masses were still low , their @xmath27 reached values as low as @xmath30 .",
    "notice that less massive galaxies ( present - day ) climb out of this minimum value of @xmath27 at lower redshifts , once they achieve a certain pivot mass . as a consequence of this , the galaxies that today have the lowest @xmath27 values are the least massive ones .",
    "the lower panel of the figure shows the evolution with redshift of the average angular momentum of the disc for the base and flip model ( dashed and solid lines ) , for the same ranges of present - day stellar masses as in the top panel . as can be seen , the dips in @xmath27 that mark the epoch of large flips correspond to the time when the angular momenta slow their rate of growth , as is the case for the highest present - day stellar masses probed down to @xmath31 ; afterward @xmath27 reaches its minimum value and rapidly increases back to unity and the angular momentum grows again . as can be seen , the angular momentum of discs in the base model is usually higher than that in the flip model once the galaxies enter their large flips eras .",
    "stewart et al . ( 2013 ) use hydrodynamic simulations to study the evolution of the angular momentum of the gas in individual disc galaxies ; in their figure 2 , it can be seen that there are several instances where the angular momentum of the gas grows more slowly than that of the dark matter , and this is the effect that we are reproducing with our simple implementation for the semi - analytic model .",
    "regarding observational results , it is interesting to note that at @xmath1 only the flip model manages to produce galaxies with higher angular momenta for higher stellar masses , in qualitative agreement with the results of romanowski & fall ( 2012 ) .",
    "our assumptions have a number of consequences for the two different cases corresponding to ( i ) accretion of gas cooling from the hot phase , and ( ii ) mergers .     and @xmath32 bands ( top and bottom panels , respectively ) , which are the most important of the statistics used in the calibration of the semi - analytic model , for the base and flip versions ( dashed and solid lines , respectively ) .",

    "this implies that galaxies with flips form more stars ( at least for equal star formation efficiency parameters ) .",
    "we adopt a salpeter initial mass function for all star formation events in the model .",

    "a perturbation triggers a starburst only when the typical distance to the galaxies sharing the dark matter halo of the unstable one is smaller than @xmath45 times the scale - length of the unstable galaxy .",
    "smaller galaxy discs are characterised by lower values of @xmath46 .",
    "they will therefore tend to produce more frequent instability events , i.e. , more frequent bursts of star formation as is seen to occur in hydrodynamical simulations ( sales et al . , 2012 ) .",

    "the reason for the similar sizes between the two models at all redshifts is that the flip model first tends to distort the distribution of galaxy sizes by extending a tail toward small disc radii , but at the same time the disc instability mechanism quickly destroys the smaller discs , making this distribution lose its small radii tail and , consequently , show a similar median value to that of the base model .",
    "this effect is present at all luminosities at both redshift ranges .",
    "in this work we presented the implementation of angular momentum slews and flips in a semi - analytic galaxy formation model .",
    "the aim in doing this was to reproduce in a more realistic way the fact that often the angular momentum of discs and that of the matter they accrete are not aligned .",
    "this lack of alignment is thought to be responsible for the destruction of discs within dark matter haloes that do not necessarily undergo a dramatic event such as a merger .",
    "the interaction of the infalling material with the disc as it arrives produces the discs to become unstable , undergo bursts , and feed new stars to a bulge .    from the hydrodynamical side , sales et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used the gimic galaxies to show that most of the discs that survive at @xmath1 show angular momentum vectors that are better aligned with the matter at turn around than particles in a spheroid component .",
    "this indicates that misaligned infall could be responsible for the formation of bulges .",
    "a possible reason behind this is that the dark matter halo that hosts a galaxy suffers several stochastic changes in its angular momentum vector as shown by bett & frenk ( 2012 ) .",
    "if the hot gas that cools toward the disc is relaxed in this dark matter halo , in most cases the cooling gas will have an angular momentum that will not necessarily be parallel to that of the cold disc it is destined to feed .",
    "in most semi - analytic models , the resolution of the parent dark matter simulation does not allow for the direction of the angular momentum of the halo to be measured with high accuracy .",
    "for this , at least @xmath18 particles per halo are needed , and most semi - analytic models use haloes with of the order of @xmath102 or more particles .",
    "therefore , we measured the probability of angular momentum flips by a given angle using subhaloes of the millennium ii simulation ( boylan - kolchin et al . , 2009 ) after they change their mass by a certain relative amount , in different redshift ranges .",
    "we construct different probability distributions for when the accretion is smooth or due to mergers .",
    "in particular , we find that at high redshifts the same relative increase in mass produces larger flips in the angular momentum of haloes .",
    "this is also the case for mergers in comparison to smooth accretion .",
    "we apply flips to the semi - analytic model sag ( cora 2006 ; lagos , cora & padilla , 2008 , lagos , padilla & cora , 2009 ; tecce et al .",
    "2010 ) by using monte - carlo simulations for the flips suffered by the galaxy angular momenta . to do this",
    ", we assume that the distributions of flips measured in the subhaloes apply as well to the baryons at their centres and that , in addition , their effect is that of slowing down the growth of angular momentum of discs with respect to their host haloes .",
    "the motivation behind this assumption comes from the results of hydrodynamical simulations that show that infalling material with misaligned angular momenta with respect to the galaxy disc could be responsible for its repeated destruction ( sales et al . , 2012 , aumer et al . ,",
    "2013 ) . in our new implementation ,",
    "the net effect of the flips is that the average disc slows down its angular momentum acquisition during its most active growth phase to then continue growing at later times .",
    "the discs that are more affected by this are those which accrete mass with misaligned angular momentum , and are those more prone to undergo instabilities and to be added to their bulge .",
    "even though discs are more unstable in the flip model , the galaxies that reach high present - day stellar masses have not been subject to disc instabilities in just as long a time as in a model with no flips , i.e. , grand - design spiral discs are also old in the flip model",
    ". however , the past history of these galaxies includes shorter lived previous incarnations of discs , i.e. more episodic discs , since the flips are more important while a galaxy is still small as it is growing in size in larger relative fractions of its mass compared to higher mass galaxies .    as the inclusion of flips increases the star formation activity at high redshifts , the stellar mass function of high redshift galaxies reaches slightly higher masses slightly improving the agreement with observations at high redshift .",
    "we also take advantage of the large flips suffered by galaxies during mergers to use the disc instability condition to produce bursts in mergers .",
    "this way our model reduces its parameter space , dispensing of three parameters that , in the base model , are used to determine whether there are bursts via conditions on different mass ratios of the merging galaxies .",
    "the resulting fractions of wet mergers ( i.e. with bursts of star formation ) in the flip model are reduced compared to the base model , but the higher frequency of bursts due to other disc instability events in the former compensates for this and makes a final galaxy population that is similar in the two models in terms of colours and morphologies .    *",
    "massive galaxies in the flip model form stars more rapidly at early times , and have less available cold gas for star formation at later times providing a better fit to the steep fall off of the bright end of the luminosity function . *",

    "<S> the angular momentum of galactic discs in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation is usually updated in time as material is accreted to the disc by adopting a constant dimensionless spin parameter and little attention is paid to the effects of accretion with misaligned angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are the subject of this paper , where we adopt a monte - carlo simulation for the changes in the direction of the angular momentum of a galaxy disc as it accretes matter based on accurate measurements from dark - matter haloes in the millennium ii simulation . in our semi - analytic model implementation , the flips seen the dark matter haloes are assumed to be the same for the cold baryons ; however , we also assume that in the latter the flip also entails a difficulty for the disc to increase its angular momentum which causes the disc to become smaller relative to a no - flip case . </S>",
    "<S> this makes star formation to occur faster , specially in low mass galaxies at all redshifts allowing galaxies to reach higher stellar masses faster . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a new condition for the triggering of starbursts during mergers . as these produce </S>",
    "<S> the largest flips it is natural to adopt the disc instability criterion to evaluate the triggering of bursts in mergers instead of one based on mass ratios as in the original model . </S>",
    "<S> the new implementation reduces the average lifetimes of discs by a factor of @xmath0 , while still allowing old ages for the present - day discs of large spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides a faster decline of star formation in massive galaxies and a better fit to the bright end of the luminosity function at @xmath1 .    </S>",
