    "recently , @xcite is accepted and published .",
    "quantum information processing and quantum computing have attracted much interest in science community because of their novel usage of quantum mechanics in technological applications .",
    "many ideas of quantum processors and computers were experimented in many architectures of physical systems , including ion traps , neutral atoms , nuclear spins in magnetic resonance , semiconductor quantum dots , and super - conducting resonators  @xcite . still the progress has been limited to a few qubit operations and the performance is far from being practical .",
    "the ability of quantum computers in outperforming their classical counterparts has not been demonstrated .    in many physical systems ,",
    "the preparation and change of quantum states , or how to prepare entanglements and how to maintain coherence , is a more difficult task than how to wire logics quantum - mechanically .",
    "however , in quantum computing with linear optical systems , it is relatively easy to deal with entanglement and decoherence . for this reason , linear optical quantum computings or the linear interactions of photons with matters",
    "are often adopted for the implementation of @xmath1-qubit quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "especially entanglement is an important aspect that a quantum mechanical device can have and the quantum information carried by an entangled state like einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) state overcomes some of the limitations of classical information used in communication and cryptography  @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been several attempts to use single - photon two - qubit states for quantum computing .",
    "_ implemented the deutsch algorithm with polarization and transverse spatial modes of the electromagnetic field as qubits  @xcite .",
    "single - photon bell states were prepared and measured by kim  @xcite .",
    "also the decoherence - free implementation of deutsch algorithm using such single - photon two logical qubits  @xcite .",
    "although such a single - photon two - qubit implementation is not scalable , the quantum gates necessary for information processing can be implemented deterministically using only linear optical elements .",
    "often a demonstration of quantum algorithm , which is performed with possibly mixed quantum states , is presented without a proper mathematical theory for the analysis of experimental data , or with a rather complicated quantum tomographical state analysis . however",
    ", if the output state of an experiment under study should be an entangled state , we can choose to use bell inequalities  @xcite .",
    "it is a sufficient condition to demonstrate a negation of bell locality and the detection of entanglement .",
    "we can consider the following question",
    ". is there a relationship between the negation of bell locality and the performance of such quantum algorithm that can be implemented by a single photon ?",
    "interestingly the answer is yes .    in this paper",
    "we have devised an experimental scheme to obtain simultaneous and nonlocal answers from deutsch problem with two unknown functions .",
    "especially we elaborate the use of _ entanglement _ in processing this quantum algorithm .",
    "the advantage of using an epr pair of photons ( two - photon two - qubit states ) in quantum computing algorithm is analyzed with bell inequalities in quantum theory .",
    "we show that a set of answers of the given deutsch problem , with two unknown functions , statistically shows a violation of bell locality in the hilbert space formalism of quantum theory .",
    "it turns out that the negation of bell locality exhibits a @xmath2 to one speed up at least .",
    "we , thus , observe a highly nonlocal effect and it leads the entangled answers in a network of pair quantum computers to provide enhanced information compared with its classical counterpart .",
    "an important note here is that there must be probabilistic errors in answers which appear due to the imperfection of the photon detection and defects in optical devices .",
    "thus it is necessary to take into account many measurements and what we can do is only to analyze probabilistically in real experimental situation . by applying the maximum likelihood principle",
    ", the answer to the deutsch problem is estimated probabilistically .    in the following sections , we introduce a method of linear optical quantum computing of deutsch problem . in the section  [ entanglement2 ] ,",
    "the method that utilizes two - photon two - qubit entanglement is discussed .",
    "this method allows statistical analysis of the average value of bell operator . in order to overcome the imperfection of the photon detection and possible defects in optical devices , the fidelity @xcite of the method is analyzed . during the analysis of bell operator or the fidelity to epr state in sec .",
    "[ witness ] , the separable states are distinguished from the entangled states . it is well known that the fidelity which is larger than @xmath3 to epr state is a sufficient condition for a negation of bell locality in the hilbert space formalism of quantum theory .",
    "we can say that our deutsch scheme succeeds with the probability of the value of the lower bound of fidelity at least under the condition where the fidelity is larger than @xmath3 .",
    "a short summary and conclusion follows in sec .  [ summary ] .",
    ", and a vertically polarized state , @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the channel ( d ) is for the extra photon for a time correlation detection.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the deutsch algorithm determines whether a given function , @xmath5 , on a binary number , @xmath6 , is either balanced or constant , where the function is constant if the function outputs for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same and balanced if not . the unknown function is defined by @xmath9 in a classical computer the answer is obtained by calculating @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while in a quantum computer only a single calculation with a superposition state of @xmath12 and @xmath8 is necessary .",
    "hence , if @xmath13 then the output label should not depend on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whereas if @xmath16 then the output label should depend on @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] , deutsch algorithm can be implemented using a two - photon state .",
    "the quantum channels ( b ) and ( c ) represent the horizontally polarized photon , in a superposition state coherently traveling along two paths 2 and 2 , from an epr photon pair .",
    "the qubits in these channels are to be simultaneously altered by the control bit in channel ( a ) that denotes @xmath17 for a balanced function or @xmath4 for a constant function .",
    "then the final photon state , which is collapsed and detected either at the detector d2 or d2 , reveals the type of the deutsch function : whether the unknown function was balanced or constant .",
    "the other photon , in the vertical polarization , is used as a gate function for the coincidence measurement .",
    "this is reminiscent of oliveira s scheme in @xcite , except that we discuss quantum - mechanical advantage of wiring two of those deutsch algorithms which are simultaneously processed by an entangled two - photon state .",
    "we describe the experimental scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ setup3 ] .",
    "the unknown functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the gray boxes represent the cnot gate in fig  [ schematic ] .",
    "the half - wave - plates labeled from hwp1 to hwp5 , oriented at @xmath20 , are the hadamard gates , which change a horizontal ( vertical ) polarization state into a 45@xmath21 ( 45@xmath21 ) polarization state .",
    "the half - wave - plates labeled as hwp in fig .  [ setup3 ] are oriented at @xmath22 and swap the horizontal and vertical polarizations , like the @xmath23 gates in fig  [ schematic ] . in our implementations , we assign the truth values 0 and 1 as @xmath24 .",
    "then , the state evolution after the logic gates @xmath14 and @xmath15 depending on the choice of the unknown deutsch function , @xmath23 for the balanced function or @xmath25 for the constant function , becomes @xmath26h|1\\rangle + \\alpha x h \\left[\\begin{tabular}{c } $ x$ \\\\",

    "this scheme is the generalization of the usual deutsch algorithm in such a way that we can determine the lower bound of the success probability of the algorithm and we can see a violation of bell locality in the hilbert space formalism of quantum theory . in this section , we consider an ideal case , i.e. , there is not any experimental noise to simplify the discussion .",
    "however , in real experimental situations , we have to take error answers into account due to experimental imperfections .",
    "thus , many runs of experiments are evidently necessary .",
    "hence , we shall discuss a method using bell operators to analyze experimental data .",
    "the method of such analysis will be presented in sec .",

    "that is , @xmath35 we see that the state of the photons @xmath36 is projected into the following @xmath37 . in order to simplify the discussion , in what follows",

    "the output polarization state of the dove prism rotates at twice the angular rate of the rotation of the prism itself .",
    "so , if a dove prism inclines at @xmath41 about a vertical line , the image rotates at @xmath42 .",
    "now we consider how a cnot gate ( cf .",

    "[ cnot ] , a horizontally polarized photon is transmitted through the polarization beam splitter . but a vertically polarized photon is reflected at the polarization beam splitter .",
    "they propagate along different ways .",
    "the angle between a vertical line and the axis of the dove prism is @xmath41 in the case of a horizontally polarized photon , but @xmath43 in the other case .",

    "we can analyze the case where the unknown function ( b ) is constant in a similar way .",
