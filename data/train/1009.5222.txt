    "in the last decade , the phenomenological implications of extra dimensional models were extensively studied .",
    "many of these studies are concentrated on the modifications caused on the gravitational potential due to extra dimensional manifolds @xcite .",
    "generally the modifications are of yukawa type ( except in randall - sundrum warped extra dimensional models ) , differing only in their strength and range ( for a very recent interesting application see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall study the modification of the gravitational potential caused by a sol extra dimensional manifold .",
    "sol manifolds are compact and orientable three dimensional manifolds , denoted as @xmath0 .",
    "we shall present the sol manifolds geometric structure . also we shall study the laplace equation on such manifolds .",
    "finally we compare the range of the corrections to the gravitational potential due to sol manifolds , with the corresponding range caused by a @xmath2 extra dimensional manifold .",
    "sol manifolds are one of thurston s 8 three dimensional geometries @xcite ( geometric structures ) .",
    "the geometrization conjecture is an approach to the geometry of three dimensional manifolds through general topological arguments .",
    "one starts with the fact that three dimensional manifolds are composed by 2-spheres or torii surfaces . according to the properties and the details of the topological gluing map of the above with @xmath4 or @xmath5",
    ", the resulting manifolds acquire locally homogeneous metrics .",
    "sol manifolds are described by one type of the 8 different homogeneous metrics .",
    "sol manifolds are obtained from @xmath6 stiffennings of torus bundles over the circle .",
    "a theorem @xcite states : given m a total bundle space of a @xmath7 bundle over @xmath5 with gluing map @xmath8 and let @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 represent the automorphism of the fundamental group of the torus @xmath7 induced by the gluing map @xmath8 . then the total bundle space admits a sol geometric structure if @xmath9 is hyperbolic , an @xmath12 structure if @xmath9 is periodic and finally a nil structure otherwise .",
    "@xmath9 is hyperbolic and gives rise to an orientable manifold if @xmath13 and we shall dwell on this choice . thus sol structure arises from the @xmath6 stiffening of the mapping torus of a torus diffeomorphism @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "two different hyperbolic gluings with @xmath14 , give rise to different geometric sol structures . @xmath9",
    "we will be represented @xmath15 so the different sol structures are classified by the integer @xmath16 , with @xmath17 .",
    "also only the positive eigenvalues of @xmath9 .",
    "let us analyze more the sol manifold structure .",
    "consider the manifold @xmath18 described by the periodic coordinates @xmath19 for the torus , defined modulo @xmath4 ( the radius of the compact dimensions ) and @xmath20 @xmath10 @xmath21 be a coordinate of @xmath22 .",
    "the combined action of the torus mapping through the hyperbolic gluing map @xmath9 diffeomorphism ( which we denote as @xmath23 ) is : @xmath24 let the matrix @xmath9 , be of the form @xmath25 but in practise we shall use the form of relation ( [ astru ] ) .",
    "the sol manifold , which is denoted as @xmath0 is the quotient of @xmath18 by the action of @xmath23 , that is @xmath26 .",
    "it is a total torus bundle over @xmath5 , with @xmath7 the fiber , @xmath5 the base space and @xmath9 the hyperbolic gluing map of the torus fibers .",
    "we consider sol manifolds for which the eigenvalues @xmath27 of @xmath9 are positive .",
    "for the case of ( [ astru ] ) the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath9 reads : @xmath28 or equivalently : @xmath29 the solutions to equation ( [ charpol1 ] ) are @xmath27 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "also the discriminant of @xmath9 is : @xmath32 which in our case reads : @xmath33 we use another coordinate system @xmath34 on the sol manifold .",
    "the @xmath35 are linear coordinates of the torus fibres related to an eigenbasis of the hyperbolic map @xmath9 .",
    "these coordinates correspond to a rotated torus lattice .",
    "the action of @xmath23 in the new coordinate system reads : @xmath36 the original lattice was orthogonal while the new torus lattice is not . if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the basis of the lattice after the action of @xmath23 identification , then @xmath39 .",
    "also the fiber coordinates @xmath7 are not periodic anymore .",
    "so in order two pairs @xmath40 and @xmath41 define the same point on the torus lattice , the following must hold : @xmath42 with @xmath43 integers and @xmath37 , @xmath38 defined previously .",
    "the riemannian metric on sol manifolds comes from the metric on the universal covering of @xmath0 .",
    "the group invariant metric on the universal covering is a sol group invariant metric . with the invariant metric on the universal covering of @xmath0 we can find the following class of metrics of sol manifolds : @xmath44 we shall use the metric ( [ metricsol ] ) in order to compute the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath0 .",
    "sol manifolds are hyperbolic manifolds with negative curvature .",
    "the hyperbolicity is a very interesting feature of sol manifolds , regarding they are torus fibrations . due to their hyperbolicity ,",
    "the distribution of eigenvalues of the laplacian is not poisson .",
    "this might have effects on the gravitons mass splitting .",
    "our purpose is to examine the corrections to the gravitational potential caused by an extra dimensional sol manifold .",
    "the spacetime manifold is of the form @xmath1 .",
    "let us review the general technique to obtain these corrections .",
    "the presentation is based on reference @xcite .",
    "consider a spacetime of the form @xmath45 , with @xmath46 an n - dimensional compact manifold and @xmath47 the four dimensional minkowski spacetime and also a complete set of orthogonal harmonic functions on @xmath47 , @xmath48 , satisfying the orthogonality condition : @xmath49 and the completeness relation : @xmath50 the functions @xmath48 are eigenfunctions of the @xmath16-dimensional laplace - beltrami operator @xmath51 of the manifold @xmath46 , with eigenvalues @xmath52 : @xmath53 the gravitational potential @xmath54 satisfies the poisson equation in @xmath55 spatial dimensions , when the newtonian limit is taken : @xmath56 with @xmath57 , the mass of the system , @xmath58 the newton constant in @xmath59 dimensions and @xmath60 equation ( [ lap ] ) corresponds to the case of large compact radius limit and has the solution : @xmath61 when the compact dimensions have small lengths , we find the harmonic expansion of @xmath54 in terms of the eigenfunctions of the product space @xmath45 , which reads : @xmath62 with @xmath63 denoting the coordinates of @xmath47 and @xmath64 denoting the coordinates of @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath65 obey : @xmath66 with solution : @xmath67 the gravitational potential is written as : @xmath68 since all point particles in the four dimensional spacetime have no dependence on the internal compact space @xmath46 , we can take @xmath69 in ( [ fingravpot ] ) to obtain the four dimensional gravitational potential : @xmath70 which is valid for large values of @xmath63 , compared to the lengths of the compact dimensions .    in the above general result of relation ( [ fingravpot1 ] )",
    "we shall apply the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of sol manifolds .",
    "in order to compute the corrections to the gravitational potential we must solve equation ( [ eigenvalueeq ] ) for the case of sol manifold @xmath0 .",
    "a much more elaborate analysis of this section can be found in @xcite .",
    "using the @xmath34 coordinates we introduced previously , the laplace - beltrami operator for the manifold @xmath71 is : @xmath72 which stems from the riemannian metric ( [ metricsol ] ) . as usual @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 the basis of the @xmath7 lattice .",
    "thus we must solve @xmath76 a function @xmath77 satisfies equation ( [ laplacegener ] ) if and only if @xmath78 satisfies the modified mathieu equation @xcite : @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . also @xmath83",
    "the volume of the sol manifold , @xmath84 , is equal to the volume of the total bundle space @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is the discriminant of the matrix @xmath9 defined in ( [ discri1 ] ) and @xmath87 is the quadratic form ( see @xcite ) corresponding to @xmath88 acting to the dual lattice of @xmath7 , with @xmath89 . the eigenvalues @xmath90 and @xmath91 are related as follows : @xmath92 it is proved in reference @xcite that the functions @xmath93 form a complete orthogonal basis on the sol manifold .",
    "the spectrum of the laplace - beltrami operator consists of two parts :    * the trivial part , with eigenvalues @xmath94 * the non - trivial part with eigenvalues @xmath95}=\\lambda_k(\\nu[\\gamma])+\\nu([\\gamma])\\cos\\theta$ ] and eigenfunctions the solutions of ( [ modmahtieu ] ) .",
    "thus we must compute the first eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "we shall use the most interesting case which is when @xmath96 is large ( or equivalently @xmath97 ) .",
    "this term contains the compactification radius of the extra dimensions and the deformation of the lattice in terms of @xmath98 .",
    "when @xmath96 becomes large , @xmath99 becomes small @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator are @xmath100 , with @xmath101 the eigenvalues of the modified mathieu operator , @xmath102 let the order of the eigenvalues be @xmath103 .",
    "we shall use the first two , since the corrections to the gravitational potential fall exponentially at the eigenvalues grow larger .",
    "thus the first two are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which asymptotically read : @xmath106 with @xmath107 : @xmath108 the eigenfunctions corresponding to the mathieu operator ( [ modopoe ] ) are , @xmath109\\ ] ] with @xmath110 counting the eigenvalues , @xmath111 corresponds to @xmath112 e.t.c .",
    "we substitute @xmath112 and @xmath105 in relation ( [ fingravpot1 ] ) with @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "also we substitute the eigenfunctions of the sol manifold , thus : @xmath115 the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients @xmath116 for @xmath117 is really simple @xcite .",
    "the terms of the form @xmath118 tend to @xmath119 , while terms of the form @xmath120 , with @xmath121 tend to zero and the gravitational potential of relation ( [ fingravpot1 ] ) becomes : @xmath122 for the first two eigenvalues we have @xmath123 or ( using the asymptotic behavior for the coefficients @xmath118 ) : @xmath124 since @xmath104 and using relations ( [ firsteigenvalue ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) we obtain finally : @xmath125 it is clear that the sol manifold correction to the newton s law gravitational potential depends on the compactification radii of the extra dimensions @xmath4 , the angle @xmath98 of the vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 and on the eigenvalues of the hyperbolic gluing map @xmath9 .",
    "in the next section we study the parameter space of the corrections found and we compare it with the @xmath2 manifold corrections .",
    "we examine first the dependence of the sol correction range @xmath126 on the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath16 . in figure ( [ 3d1 ] )",
    "we plot the dependence for the compactification radius value @xmath127 ( smaller than the current experimental bound @xmath128 ) and for @xmath129 , while in figure ( [ 3d2 ] ) and ( [ 0201 ] ) the values of @xmath4 are @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "the sol structure gives very large corrections to gravity if the compactification radius is very small ( of order @xmath132 and smaller ) .",
    "also we shall check out the behavior of the range of the corrections around @xmath133 which is the expected scale that three extra dimensional spaces should have . according to figures ( [ 3d1 ] ) , ( [ 3d2 ] ) , and ( [ 0201 ] )",
    ", we can see that the last two are similar .",
    "thus for large values of @xmath16 ( @xmath134 ) and for @xmath135 , the corrections are very small . in the other two graphs when @xmath136 and for small values of @xmath98 , the corrections are small",
    ". we shall compare the range of sol manifolds with the range of the @xmath2 torus corrections .",
    "in figure ( [ t3 ] ) we plot the range of the @xmath2 corrections as a function of @xmath63 with @xmath137 and @xmath138 and in figure ( [ 005 ] ) the corresponding dependence for the sol manifold case .",
    "as it can be seen from figure ( [ 3d1 ] ) , the term @xmath126 is very big compared to @xmath139 , for small @xmath16 ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "as @xmath16 grows the term becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "figure ( [ 005 ] ) corresponds to @xmath141 .",
    "as @xmath16 grows , the range of sol - corrections becomes comparable and after a value of @xmath16 , smaller compared to the @xmath2 corrections .",
    "the case with @xmath142 mm is very interesting . according to figure ( [ comparissonnew ] )",
    "the range of sol corrections can vary significantly depending on the value that @xmath16 takes .",
    "compared to the corresponding 3-torus range , sol corrections can be much larger ( for small @xmath16 ) and comparable ( for @xmath143 ) but never smaller even for very large @xmath16 .",
    "-dependence of the range of @xmath2 and sol corrections for @xmath144 mm for various @xmath16 , and @xmath138 ]    also sol corrections can exist for compactification radii and at distances for which the corresponding @xmath2 torus range values are very large ( and consequently not experimentally preferable ) .",
    "we studied the corrections to the gravitational potential caused by a sol manifold extra dimensional compact space . after investigating",
    "the parameter space we found that the range of sol manifolds corrections can be similar to the @xmath2 torus results and can be very different compared to the @xmath2 results depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "we left unanswered two issues , the graviton production and how do we distinguish sol manifolds corrections from other corrections ( the last due to the rich parameter space of sol manifolds ) .",
