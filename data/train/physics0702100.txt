    "the variational approach in geometrical optics was established in 1657 when the famous french mathematician pierre de fermat provided a mathematical proof that the straight line is not the fastest way for light to traverse between two optical media @xcite .",
    "this simple and new way of looking at the propagation of light was already empirically noticed by hero of alexandria fifteen centuries before fermat by observing that the path of the light between two points upon reflection from a plane mirror is the shortest possible path .",
    "fermat s insightful and intriguing idea that `` the nature always acts in the shortest ways '' has influenced generations of scientists , like maupertius , euler , lagrange , hamilton and feynman , to successively translate classical and quantum physics into the language of variational calculus @xcite .",
    "today , the practical value of fermat s principle is immense , ranging from applications in geophysics , oceanography and material physics on one side , to general relativity and astrophysics on the other @xcite .    the modern formulation of fermat s principle states that a light in going between two fixed points traverses an optical path length that is stationary with respect to the variations of that path . in most cases , this formulation reduces to the original one that the actual path between the two points is the path which requires the shortest time @xcite .",
    "an accurate description of the process beyond fermat s principle is provided by the modern quantum electrodynamics , where the light is considered to be made out of photons .",
    "accordingly , the photon takes all the available paths in going between two fixed points , each path at a certain probability , and the principle of least time follows as an approximation of this argument @xcite .",
    "fermat s principle has been initially established for optical systems whose properties are time - independent , and , as such , has entered the mainstream of the standard undergraduate physics curriculum through the derivations of the well - known laws of reflection and refraction of light at a smooth stationary interface between two optical materials at rest @xcite .",
    "recently , fermat s principle was proven valid for optical systems with time - dependent parameters , incorporating the situations of light propagation in uniformly moving optical media @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that einstein s law of reflection of light from a plane mirror in uniform rectilinear motion follows from fermat s principle and the constant speed of light postulate , providing an indirect proof of the validity of fermat s principle when the boundaries upon which the light is reflected are moving at relativistic speeds @xcite .",
    "apart from the latter example , it seems that the problems of light propagation involving uniformly moving boundaries and media have never been attacked directly by using fermat s principle of least time .",
    "motivated by the latest extensions to non - stationary cases , in this paper we will use fermat s principle to derive the formulas for the law of refraction of a light ray in two specific situations when the boundaries and the media are moving at constant velocities .",
    "we will limit our analysis to optical media that are homogeneous , isotropic and nonconducting in their rest frames of reference . also , we consider the media to be non - dispersive at rest , in the sense that the correcting terms due to dispersion are so small that can be neglected .",
    "we begin our discussion in sec .",
    "ii by showing that an optical medium , isotropic in its rest frame , exhibits an optical anisotropy with respect to the frame where the medium is in uniform rectilinear motion .",
    "we derive the expression for the speed of the photon in the moving medium and show that it depends on the angle between the light ray and the velocity of the medium .",
    "we describe this relativistically induced optical anisotropy in a more convenient way , by introducing an effective refractive index of the moving medium , defined as a ratio between the speed of the photon in vacuum and the speed of the photon in the moving medium .",
    "the notion that the photon will `` see '' the moving medium as a stationary medium having an effective refractive index different from its refractive index at rest , is incorporated into fermat s principle in sec .",
    "iii and iv to investigate the refraction of the photon incident from a vacuum half - space upon a uniformly moving material half - space . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the situation when the material half - space is moving parallel to the interface , and in sec .",
    "iv we take the material half - space to move perpendicularly to the interface . in both cases , we consider the plane of incidence to be normal to the vacuum - material interface and parallel to the velocity of the medium .    a summary of the results and a comparison with other similar treatments are given in sec .",
    "v , where the possibility to extend the method to more complicated configurations is also suggested .",
    "alternative derivation of the refraction law when the material half - space is moving perpendicular to the interface is presented in appendix a. finally , in appendix b , the conditions for the appearance of the backward refraction are derived analytically .",
    "if a flash of light is emitted from a fixed point source in an empty space ( a vacuum ) , the outgoing photons will move radially on a spherical wavefront expanding at a speed of light @xmath0 @xcite . with respect to an observer from a frame that moves in a straight line at a constant velocity",
    ", the wavefront of the pulse will remain sphere , expanding at the same constant speed @xmath0 in all directions @xcite .",
    "the result is a corollary of the second postulate of special relativity that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same in all inertial frames of reference regardless of the motion of the light source @xcite .",
    "the situation is changed if the expansion of the pulse is taking place in a material medium @xcite . if we consider a homogeneous , isotropic and non - dispersive transparent medium at rest with respect to @xmath1-frame , and if we treat the problem two - dimensionally , the equation that describes the evolution of the pulse is : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the refractive index of the material at rest .",

    "when the medium moves in the negative direction of the @xmath48-axis up to some value of @xmath123 denoted as @xmath124 , the refraction seems to be regular . in this range of speeds ( @xmath125 ) , as the absolute value of the speed increases , the curves are shifted toward higher values of @xmath65 , and @xmath65 remains smaller than @xmath78 for each @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath126 , a specific value for the incident angle @xmath64 appears for which the angle of refraction of the photon becomes equal to @xmath78 .",
    "we denote this critical incident angle by @xmath127 . for @xmath128 , the angle of refraction @xmath65 is greater than @xmath78 . by further increasing the absolute value of @xmath45 , the critical angle @xmath127 decreases , and for some value of @xmath123 , denoted by @xmath129 , @xmath127 becomes @xmath113 . for @xmath130 , the angle of refraction",
    "@xmath65 is greater than @xmath78 for all values of @xmath64 .",
    "the quantities @xmath124 and @xmath129 are functions on the refractive index @xmath3 of the medium in its rest frame , and as @xmath3 increases , the values of @xmath124 and @xmath129 are becoming closer to each other .",
    "it can be shown ( see appendix b ) that @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( in our case , for @xmath72 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) . evidently , the value @xmath129 corresponds to the smallest superluminal speed of the medium .",
    "the existence of angles of refraction greater than @xmath78 in the case @xmath122 implies that the photon , instead of moving in the same general direction as before the refraction , moves backward . at first sight",
    ", it might seem that the photon was reflected at the interface instead of being refracted , but this is not what had happened ( see fig .",
    "once the photon strikes the vacuum - material interface , it undergoes a refraction , enters the medium and continues to move into the medium at all times .",
    "the curious behavior of the refracted photon is due to the fact that the photon , while penetrating into the medium , is dragged by the overall motion of the medium .",
    "this dragging effect is a cause for the @xmath48-component of the photon s velocity in the moving medium to be negative , and hence , the refracted photon will move in the same general direction as the medium .",
    "we emphasize that the path of the photon that undergoes a backward refraction does not coincide with the path which it would trace if it were reflected from the interface ( see fig .",
    "the path of the backwardly refracted photon is fully determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.18 ] ) , and the path of the reflected photon obeys the einstein s formula for reflection from a uniformly moving mirror ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the language of modern quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "whether the photon will be reflected or refracted at the inerface is a matter of probability . in this sense , if a beam of photons is incident on the moving interface at an angle @xmath64 , and if the conditions for the appearance of the backward refraction are fulfilled , some of the photons will be reflected , and some backwardly refracted .",
    "therefore , in a more realistic view in which the reflection is considered also , two different beams spreading backward will be identified . in this way",
    ", we have a full consistency between the observations with respect to both inertial frames , @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "namely , for the observer in @xmath1-frame to which the medium is at rest , both processes are developing in an ordinary way : the refracted photon moves forward , obeying the snell s law of refraction , while the reflected one moves backward , according to the usual law of reflection : incident angle equals the reflected angle .",
    "hence , the observer in @xmath1 clearly distinguishes two rays , and consequently , two rays must exist with respect to the observer in the @xmath8-frame : one reflected , and one backwardly refracted .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to the problem of refraction of a light ray at an interface between two homogeneous , isotropic and non - dispersive transparent optical materials in uniform rectilinear motion .",
    "our method amalgamates the original fermat s principle and the fact that an isotropic optical material at rest becomes optically anisotropic if it is moving at a constant velocity .",
    "the derivation is in the framework of basic optics and special relativity , requiring some knowledge of calculus at an elementary level . as such",
    ", it may be regarded as an instructive addendum to the typical introductory physics courses .",
    "we have analyzed in details the refraction at a vacuum - material interface , when the material half - space is moving uniformly parallel or uniformly perpendicular to the interface . in both cases , we considered the plane of incidence to be normal to the interface and parallel to the velocity of the medium .",
    "the coincidence of the obtained refraction formulas with the ones obtained with the other methods confirms the validity of fermat s principle in the presence of uniformly moving boundaries and media .",
    "in addition , when the material half - space moves perpendicular to the interface , in the direction which is opposite to that of the incident light , we observed a `` backward refraction '' of light . to our knowledge , this optical effect has not been noticed before in the literature .",
    "we emphasize that the refraction formulas obtained in this paper refer to refraction of a photon , and thus , describe the refraction of a light ray .",
    "we note that in a set of papers on the subject of reflection and transmission of a plane electromagnetic wave by a moving medium , starting with the pioneering papers by tai and yeh , the refraction formulas for different setups were derived by using the notions from the classical electromagnetic theory and the lorentz transformation @xcite .",
    "although these publications also include the cases discussed in our sections iii and iv , the resulting refraction formulas do not match the refraction formulas in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.12 ] ) and ( [ eq:4.18 ] ) in our paper @xcite .",
    "this mismatch is due to the fact that tai , yeh and their successors considered the angles of incidence , reflection and refraction of the light wave as the angles between the corresponding propagation vectors and the interface normal .",
    "however , we have shown that an optical isotropic medium in uniform rectilinear motion becomes an optical anisotropic medium . therefore , the propagation vector in the moving medium will , in general , not coincide with the light ray in the moving medium . in conclusion ,",
    "the refraction formulas by tai , yeh and their followers do not refer to refraction of a light ray .    the approach in this paper can be extended to include more sophisticated situations , specifically , by taking into account the dispersion of the material , or considering various three - dimensional cases when the plane of incidence is not necessary normal to the interface and not parallel to the velocity of the medium .",
    "we also suggest a repetition of the derivations in sec .",
    "iii and iv when the refraction occurs at an interface between two uniformly moving non - vacuum optical materials having different refractive indices in their rest frames of reference .",
    "the authors are indebted to i. carusotto for constructive comments that substantially improved the discussions in sections iv and v. we also thank j. hamel , n. novkovski , k. trenevski and v. urumov for a critical reading of the manuscript , and v. jovanov for helping us with the references .",
    "the refraction formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.18 ] ) can also be obtained by comparing the path of the photon in the @xmath1- frame where the medium is stationary , to the corresponding path of the photon in the @xmath8-frame where the medium is in uniform rectilinear motion .",
    "we first describe the reflection with respect to @xmath1-frame .",
    "let the vacuum - material interface coincide with @xmath135-axis , with @xmath136 being the region of the material half - space , and @xmath137 the region of the vacuum half - space .",
    "let the photon be incident on the interface from the vacuum half - space in a direction making a positive angle @xmath138 with the interface normal .",
    "the photon is refracted in the material half - space at an angle @xmath139 with respect to the interface normal , obeying the snell s law of refraction : @xmath140 where @xmath3 is the refractive index of the medium at rest .",
    "taking that the incident photon moves at a speed of light in vacuum @xmath0 , and the refracted photon at a speed @xmath23 , the velocity components of the photon in the @xmath1-frame are : @xmath141 where index `` 1 '' corresponds to the components of the incident photon , and index `` 2 '' to the components of the refracted photon ( for simplicity , we use @xmath142 and @xmath143 instead of @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) . with respect to",
    "@xmath8-frame where the material half - space is moving at a constant speed @xmath9 in the positive @xmath48-direction , the photon is incident on the moving interface at an angle @xmath64 at the same constant speed @xmath0 as in the @xmath1-frame , but its speed after being refracted from the interface is @xmath146 which is a function of the angle of refraction @xmath65 .",
