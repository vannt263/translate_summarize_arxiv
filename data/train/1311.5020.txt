    "the nuclear deformation and neutron - transfer process have been identified as playing a major role in the magnitude of the sub - barrier fusion ( capture ) cross sections  @xcite .",
    "there are a several experimental evidences which confirm the importance of nuclear deformation on the fusion .",
    "the influence of nuclear deformation is straightforward .",
    "if the target nucleus is prolate in the ground state , the coulomb field on its tips is lower than on its sides , that then increases the capture or fusion probability at energies below the barrier corresponding to the spherical nuclei .",
    "the role of neutron transfer reactions is less clear .",
    "the importance of neutron transfer with positive @xmath0-values on nuclear fusion ( capture ) originates from the fact that neutrons are insensitive to the coulomb barrier and therefore they can start being transferred at larger separations before the projectile is captured by target - nucleus .",
    "therefore , it is generally thought that the sub - barrier fusion cross section will increase because of the neutron transfer .",
    "the fusion ( capture ) dynamics induced by loosely bound radioactive ion beams is currently being extensively studied .",
    "however , the long - standing question whether fusion ( capture ) is enhanced or suppressed with these beams has not yet been answered unambiguously .",
    "the study of the fusion reactions involving nuclei at the drip - lines has led to contradictory results .",
    "in the quantum diffusion approach  @xcite the capture of the projectile by the target - nucleus is described with a single relevant collective variable : the relative distance between the colliding nuclei .",
    "this approach takes into consideration the fluctuation and dissipation effects in collisions of heavy ions which model the coupling of the relative motion with various channels ( for example , the non - collective single - particle excitations , low - lying collective dynamical modes of the target and projectile ) .",
    "the nuclear static deformation effects are taken into account through the dependence of the nucleus - nucleus potential on the deformations and mutual orientations of the colliding nuclei .",
    "we have to mention that many quantum - mechanical and non - markovian effects accompanying the passage through the potential barrier are taken into consideration in our formalism  @xcite .",
    "the capture cross section is a sum of partial capture cross sections  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reduced de broglie wavelength , @xmath3 is the reduced mass ( @xmath4 is the nucleon mass ) , and the summation is over the possible values of angular momentum @xmath5 at a given bombarding energy @xmath6 . knowing the potential of the interacting nuclei for each orientation with the angles @xmath7 , one can obtain the partial capture probability @xmath8 which is defined by the passing probability of the potential barrier in the relative distance @xmath9 coordinate at a given @xmath5 .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is obtained by integrating the propagator @xmath10 from the initial state @xmath11 at time @xmath12 to the final state @xmath13 at time @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is a momentum ) : @xmath16 . \\label{1ab_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second line in ( [ 1ab_eq ] ) is obtained by using the propagator @xmath17 ( @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) calculated for an inverted oscillator which approximates the nucleus - nucleus potential @xmath26 in the variable @xmath9 .",
    "the frequency @xmath27 of this oscillator with an internal turning point @xmath28 is defined from the condition of equality of the classical actions of approximated and realistic potential barriers of the same hight at given @xmath5 .",
    "this approximation is well justified for the reactions and energy range , which are here considered .",
    "we assume that the sub - barrier capture mainly depends on the optimal one - neutron ( @xmath29 ) or two - neutron ( @xmath30 ) transfer with the positive @xmath0-value .",
    "our assumption is that , just before the projectile is captured by the target - nucleus ( just before the crossing of the coulomb barrier ) which is a slow process , the transfer occurs and can lead to the population of the first excited collective state in the recipient nucleus  @xcite ( the donor nucleus remains in the ground state ) .",
    "so , the motion to the @xmath31 equilibrium starts in the system before the capture because it is energetically favorable in the dinuclear system in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier .",
    "for the reactions under consideration , the average change of mass asymmetry is connected to the one- or two - neutron transfer ( @xmath32- or @xmath33-transfer ) . since after the transfer",
    "the mass numbers , the isotopic composition and the deformation parameters of the interacting nuclei , and , correspondingly , the height @xmath34 and shape of the coulomb barrier are changed , one can expect an enhancement or suppression of the capture . if after the neutron transfer the deformations of interacting nuclei increase ( decrease ) , the capture probability increases ( decreases ) . when the isotopic dependence of the nucleus - nucleus potential is weak and after the transfer",
    "the deformations of interacting nuclei do not change , there is no effect of the neutron transfer on the capture . in comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the negative transfer @xmath35values do not play visible role in the capture process .",
    "our scenario was verified in the description of many reactions  @xcite .",
    "because the capture cross section is equal to the complete fusion cross section for the reactions treated , the quantum diffusion approach for the capture is applied to study the complete fusion .",
    "all calculated results are obtained with the same set of parameters as in ref .",
    "realistic friction coefficient in the relative distance coordinate @xmath36=2 mev is used .",
    "its value is close to that calculated within the mean - field approaches  @xcite .",
    "for the nuclear part of the nucleus - nucleus potential , the double - folding formalism with the skyrme - type density - dependent effective nucleon - nucleon interaction is used  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential @xmath37 are adjusted to describe the experimental data at energies above the coulomb barrier corresponding to spherical nuclei .",
    "the absolute values of the experimental quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath38 of even - even deformed nuclei in the ground state and of the first excited collective states of nuclei are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the nuclei deformed in the ground state ,",
    "the @xmath38 in the first excited collective state is similar to the @xmath38 in the ground state . for the quadruple deformation parameter of an odd nucleus",
    ", we choose the maximal value from the deformation parameters of neighboring even - even nuclei ( for example , @xmath38(@xmath39th)=@xmath38(@xmath40th)=@xmath38(@xmath41th)=0.261 ) .",
    "for the double magic and neighboring nuclei , we take @xmath42 in the ground state .",
    "since there are uncertainties in the definition of the values of @xmath38 in light - mass nuclei , one can extract the ground - state quadrupole deformation parameters of these nuclei from a comparison of the calculated capture cross sections with the existing experimental data . by describing the reactions @xmath43c+@xmath44pb , @xmath45o+@xmath44pb , @xmath46s+@xmath47zr , @xmath48s+@xmath49er , @xmath50s+@xmath51zr , @xmath52ni + @xmath52ni , and @xmath53ni + @xmath52ni , where there are no neutron transfer channels with positive @xmath0-values , we extract the ground - state quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath38=-0.3 , 0.1 , 0.312 , 0.1 , 0 , 0.05 , and 0.087 , for the nuclei @xmath43c , @xmath45o , @xmath54s , @xmath48s , @xmath50s , @xmath52ni , and @xmath53ni , respectively , which are used in our calculations .",
