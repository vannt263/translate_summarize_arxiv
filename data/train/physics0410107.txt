    "plasma rotation velocity measurements are of great importance for understanding transition to improved confinement in tokamaks and physics of transport barriers . extensively used nowadays for such investigations is doppler reflectometry  @xcite .",

    "a back - scattered signal with frequency differing from the probing one is registered by a nearby standing or the same antenna .",
    "the information on plasma poloidal rotation is obtained in this technique from the frequency shift of the backscattering spectrum which is supposed to originate from the doppler effect due to the fluctuation rotation .",
    "spatial distribution of the scattering phenomena , which is usually assumed to occur in the cut - off vicinity , is the key issue for the diagnostic applications .    some numerical simulations undertaken ( see  @xcite and references there , @xcite ) and analytical results  @xcite demonstrate the possibility of the measurements localization by the cut - off but the problem of doppler reflectometry locality remains still open and lacks comprehensive analytical treatment .",
    "this stems from the fact that to be sure that main contribution to the registered signal is made by the cut - off vicinity one should compare it with integral contributions of distant from the cut - off regions which can be substantial depending on density profile .",

    "the effects of cylindricalness become important when the probing beam width in the cut - off vicinity is comparable with the cut - off surface curvature radius which takes place in small toroidal devices or in case of probing of plasma central regions .",
    "these cases of essentially cylindrical plasma geometry were considered numerically in  @xcite and analytically ( for specific plasma density profiles ) in  @xcite . in these papers",
    "rather obvious conclusion was obtained that plasma poloidal curvature enhances the diagnostics sensitivity to the fluctuations with high poloidal wavenumbers .",
    "another cylindrical geometry effect was investigated numerically in  @xcite where strong influence of the plasma cylindricalness on the diagnostics locality was demonstrated .",
    "essential can be the plasma poloidal curvature influence on the focused antenna beam . in the present paper",
    "it was neglected , which is correct , when the focus radial shift due to refraction associated with the plasma curvature is less than radial fluctuation correlation length  @xmath84 .",
    "this criterion can be represented in form @xmath207 here @xmath208 is the ray trajectory length from the antenna to cut - off , which was defined above , @xmath209 is the distance between the antenna and the cut - off and @xmath210 is the plasma radius in poloidal plane .",
    "roughly this criterion can be approximated as @xmath211 .",
    "when it fails to hold to provide the focusing to the cut - off the probing wavefront curvature radius should be calculated taking into account plasma poloidal curvature .",
    "all the mentioned effects will be taken into account in separate paper of the authors .    additionally it should be noted that 2d plasma geometry effects like cylindricalness are not a priory significant in reflectometry ( see e.g.  @xcite , where it was demonstrated both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite that 2d theory predictions for radial correlation reflectometry are similar to conclusions of simple 1d model ) .    the second essential assumption made in the paper",
    "is associated with linear character of the scattering signal formation . according to  @xcite",
    "this approximation is correct when following criterion is satisfied    @xmath212    here @xmath213 is r.m.s amplitude of the turbulence and @xmath214 denotes the density in the cut - off .",
    "it can be seen that   can be violated in case of high fluctuation amplitude or long trajectory length . in this case probing wave multi - scattering should be taken into account .",
    "this situation can be treated analytically by the procedure using in  @xcite and it will be done in the paper by the authors which is now under preparation for submission .    for diagnostics results interpretation",
    "it is important to distinguish linear and nonlinear situation . to do that",
    "experimentally one can use additional acquisition antenna ( antenna 2 in ) which receives the wave reflected from the cut - off .",
    "if the specular component persists in the frequency spectrum measured by this additional antenna the distortions of the probing wave in propagation are weak and we deal with linear situation of single - scattering . in the opposite case when the line at probing frequency is lost in the broadened reflection spectrum these distortions due to propagation in turbulent plasma lead to extinction of the specular component , which indicates transition to nonlinear small - angle multi - scattering regime .",
    "this way of experimental confirmation seems to be reliable but needs additional access to plasma .",
    "if it is impossible some information can be obtained from the form of doppler reflectometry spectrum received by antenna 1 in .",
    "if the frequency spectrum width is consistent with estimation made based on the antenna pattern width @xmath215 one can conclude that the signal most likely resulted from single - scattering .",
    "the scattering efficiency introduced and analytically obtained  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) ,  ( [ eq : sfs ] ) in the paper reveals main similarities and differences of conventional reflectometry and doppler technique . in the both methods scattering signal is proportional to reversed square of probing wavenumber  @xcite . that provides the diagnostics with spatial localization , which can be rather poor in case of unfavorable density profile .",
    "the back - scattering signal component formation is similar for tilted probing , which is performed in doppler technique and normal probing which is specific for conventional method . in particular , in both cases the probing wave focusing to the cut - off , according to  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) , underlines the cut - off region contribution and should improve the diagnostics localization .",
    "it is worth mentioning that utilization of non - slab probing wave fronts have been already discussed in  @xcite , however in these papers the front curvature was chosen close to the cut off surface curvature in order to improve the doppler reflectometry wave number resolution  @xcite , or to reduce the 2d interference effects in the signals reflected from different parts of corrugated cut off surface  @xcite .",
    "finally it should be noted that 2d - focusing onto the cut - off surface , which can be easily realized in experiment , can provide even better localization than 1d - focusing only possible within 2d model considered in the present paper .",
    "essential are the peculiarities of fs efficiency  ( [ eq : sfs ] ) . both for doppler and conventional reflectometry the cut - off contribution to the fs component",
    "is received by the most favorable part of the antenna diagram @xmath216 .",
    "however the suppression of the signal coming from the plasma volume in the case of conventional reflectometry takes place only for fluctuations satisfying condition @xmath217 , at which the cut off contribution is suppressed as well . for longer poloidal scales @xmath218",
    "the suppression is not efficient and additional localization is not possible . on contrary for doppler reflectometry due to",
    "the tilted probing the fs component of the signal , coming from the plasma volume is suppressed providing the following condition is fulfilled @xmath219 it can be easily achieved by large enough antenna tilt angle or beam width , or by the focusing to the cut - off , thus making the fs contribution extremely localized to the cut - off .    finally we discuss the wavenumber resolution of the doppler reflectometry .",
    "the scattering efficiency obtained  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) ,  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) demonstrates that diagnostics possess practically no radial wavenumber resolution due to the fact that scattering signal is an integral over radial wavenumbers and small @xmath23 are pronounced with weight function @xmath220 .",
    "poloidal wavenumber resolution can be easily estimated and is determined by antenna pattern width . for bs contribution",
    "it can be represented as @xmath221 fs poloidal wavenumber resolution can be @xmath222 times worse .",
    "in the present paper the doppler reflectometry spatial and wavenumber resolution is analyzed in the framework of the linear born approximation in slab plasma model .",
    "the results obtained provide realistic description of doppler reflectometry experiment in large elongated plasma at low level of density perturbation .",
    "explicit expression for the backscattering spectrum is obtained in terms of wavenumber and frequency spectra of turbulence assumed to be statistically inhomogeneous in radial direction .",
    "the treatment is performed for arbitrary density profile and antenna pattern taking into account diffraction effects . in agreement with",
    "@xcite it is demonstrated that the signal consists of contributions of back and forward scattering in radial direction , which take place both before and after the reflection of the probing wave in the turning point .",
    "similar to the traditional fluctuation reflectometry  @xcite the scattering efficiency for both back and forward scattering is shown to be inverse proportional to the square of radial wavenumber of the probing wave at the fluctuation location thus making the spatial resolution of diagnostics sensitive to the density profile .",
    "it is shown that additional localization is provided in case of forward scattering in the radial direction by the antenna diagram and in case of backscattering by the fact that the turbulence spectrum is suppressed at high radial wavenumbers .",
    "the improvement of the diagnostics locality by probing beam focusing onto the cut - off surface is proposed described as well .",
    "it is demonstrated that analytical expressions obtained can be easily used for fast interpretation of doppler reflectometry data in particular for estimation of this diagnostics locality .",
    "they can as well serve for benchmarking and testing of full wave numerical codes developed for interpretation of conventional fluctuation reflectometry data  @xcite , should the authors consider the application of these codes to the field of doppler reflectometry .    the magnetic surfaces curvature , if important , can be accounted for within the same theoretical approach applied to cylindrical plasma geometry .",
    "the nonlinear effects in doppler reflectometry spectra formation becoming significant in large devices and at high density perturbation level can be described within wkb approximation in the way similar to one used in  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : app ] here we estimate additional contribution to the forward scattering efficiency  ( [ eq : sfs ] ) , which can be provided by singularities of the term @xmath223 in  .",

    "the branching point contribution is especially large in the cut - off vicinity where @xmath229 and @xmath230 the real part of right branching points @xmath231 in this case coincides with the stationary phase point @xmath232 which gives the main contribution to the fs efficiency .",
    "the analysis in this case becomes complicated and inaccurate in wkb approximation .",
