    "if every isomorphism between two induced finite substructures of @xmath0 can be extended to an automorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "this property represents high degree of symmetry .",
    "most of the usual properties of symmetry are implied by ultrahomogeneity  for example , in the finite case , the vertex - transitivity , the edge - transitivity or even the distance transitivity are implied by ultrahomogeneity . on the other hand usual examples of highly symmetric graphs",
    "are not necessarily ultrahomogeneous .",
    "the petersen graph is a well known example of a symmetric and non - ulrahomogeneous graph ; it contains two independent sets of size three ( depicted in figure [ fig : petersenhom ] ) that can not be mapped one to another by an automorphism .",
    "there exists a long standing classification program of ultrahomogeneous structures , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the results are nontrivial even in the seemingly simple case of finite undirected graphs without loops .",
    "catalog of those graphs was given by gardiner  @xcite : a finite graph is ultrahomogeneous if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the following : ( 1 ) disjoint union of finitely many copies of a complete graph @xmath11 , ( 2 ) complete multipartite graph ( complement of ( 1 ) ) , ( 3 ) a @xmath12-cycle , and ( 4 ) a line graph @xmath13 of the complete bipartite graph @xmath14 .    by the above classification cycles",
    "are ultrahomogeneous up to size @xmath12 ( @xmath15 is a complete graph , @xmath16 is a complete bipartite graph , @xmath17 is a sporadic case ) .",

    "@xmath18 can be turned into an ultrahomogeneous structure by introducing another type of edges , say red edges , and by connecting every pair of vertices of distance 2 by a red edge . resulting structure is ultrahomogeneous and we consider such extended structure to be a _ homogenization _ of structure .",
    "cherlin  @xcite , when explaining more general theory of ultrahomogeneous structures  @xcite , notices that such a process is more general  classifications of ultrahomogeneous structures usually contain sporadic ultrahomogeneous structures that can be considered as members of regular ultrahomogeneous families in an extended language .",
    "althrough @xmath17 is a sporadic case of ultrahomogeneous graph , it is a part of a family of graph cycles that are all ultrahomogeneous as metric graphs .",
    "homogenization is also important concept of constructing universal structures @xcite .",
    "we introduce our two notions of complexity ; the relational complexity and the lift complexity . first , however , we take time to review the process of adding new types of relations into a structure more formally .",
    "let @xmath20 be a type containing type @xmath7 .",
    "( by this we mean @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . ) then every structure @xmath24 may be viewed as a structure @xmath25 together with some additional relations for @xmath26 . to make this more explicit ,",

    "thus a structure @xmath24 will be written as @xmath28 and , abusing notation , more briefly as @xmath29    we call @xmath30 a _ lift _ of @xmath0 and @xmath0 is called the _ shadow _ of @xmath30 . in this sense",
    "the class @xmath31 is the class of all lifts of @xmath8 .",

    "if all extended relations are unary , the lift is called _ monadic_. in the context of monadic lifts , the _ color _ of vertex @xmath32 representing unary relation is the set @xmath33 .",
    "note that a lift is also in the model - theoretic setting called an _ expansion _ ( as we are expanding our relational language ) and a shadow a _ reduct _ ( as we are reducing it ) . unless stated explicitely",

    "as a warmup , we state few basic observations about relational and lift complexities .",

    "the same holds for both of our notions of complexity .",
    "relational and lift complexity is closed under complementation .",

    "the relational structure of arity @xmath58 do not however contribute into the homogenization of the structure giving the bound of @xmath59 on the relational complexity of finite structure .",

    "this finishes proof of ( 1 ) .",
    "to show ( 2 ) we need to add only invariant unary and binary relations depending on isomorphism type of components .",
    "first we add unary relations classifying vertices by an isomorphism type of a connected component they belong to . if there is no pair of mutually isomorphic components @xmath71 such that @xmath72 , then the lift is extended by all necessary relations that make each component ultrahomogeneous which creates an ultrahomogeneous lift .    for every @xmath63 along with one or more components @xmath73 , @xmath74 , ",
    "@xmath75 that are all distinct and isomorphic to @xmath63 , we add two extra binary relations ; first relation used to join all pairs of vertices within the same component , while second joins all pairs of vertices within two different components .",
    "these additional relations prevents partial isomorphisms exchanging vertices in between individual connected components leading to an ultrahomogeneous structure after applying all remaining relations like above .",
