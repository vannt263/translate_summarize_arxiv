    "the generation of nonclassical states of light for applications such as quantum computing  @xcite , quantum key distribution  @xcite , or quantum lithography and metrology  @xcite has been extensively investigated for quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite due to their large optical dipole moment , discrete optical transitions , and nearly fourier transform limited linewidth .",
    "however , any potential quantum light source must be efficiently integrated with a resonator for effective use in a practical quantum network . towards this goal , it was demonstrated that strongly coupled qd - photonic crystal resonator systems are capable of high - fidelity single - photon generation with superior generation rates  @xcite .",
    "importantly , such systems are promising for on - chip geometries , since they can be integrated into optical circuits due to their efficient coupling to waveguides  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their promising potential for multi - photon generation has yet to be fully investigated .",
    "strongly coupled qd - nanocavity systems have long been seen as a versatile platform for the generation of nonclassical light .",
    "the enhancement of the light - matter interaction due to the presence of a resonator leads to a nonlinear ladder of hybridized polaritonic states .",
    "this enables transmitted light with a sub - poissonian photocount distribution  @xcite in the regime known as photon - blockade and it also enables transmitted light with a super - poissonian photocount distribution  @xcite in the photon - induced tunneling regime .",
    "the highly - dissipative nature of nanophotonic systems has so far obscured the generation of multi - photon pulses with @xmath0 photons , where @xmath1  @xcite . here",
    ", we combine the recently discovered self - homodyne interference technique  @xcite with a finite emitter - cavity detuning in order to more effectively resolve multi - photon emission from a solid - state nanocavity system .    in this context",
    ", we investigate the coherent interaction of a pulsed excitation laser with the first and second polaritonic rung of a detuned qd - nanocavity system .",
    "we present frequency - filtered correlation measurements under resonant excitation at different qd - cavity and laser detunings that allow us to explore the rich physics of quantum cascades in the solid - state system s anharmonic ladder .",
    "in particular , we explore the effect of our system s coupling to its phonon bath .",
    "notably , by resonantly exciting the first rung of this ladder , our measurements provide further insight into phonon - assisted population transfer .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that for specific excitation conditions the system enables multi - photon emission at the cavity frequency with a strongly enhanced two - photon component .",
    "the sample under investigation consists of a single inas qd strongly coupled to a photonic crystal l3 cavity  @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling between qd and cavity can be observed in cross - polarized reflectivity measurements  @xcite . by changing the sample temperature",
    ", we can control the qd - cavity detuning @xmath2 , tune the qd through the cavity resonance and observe a distinct anticrossing ( figure  [ fig : figure1](a ) ) .",
    "this anticrossing results from the strong coupling between qd and cavity , which occurs if the coupling strength overcomes the field losses of the system .",
    "consists of an upper polariton and a lower polariton up@xmath0 and lp@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "( * c * ) measured degree of second - order coherence as a function of the laser detuning for a qd - cavity detuning of @xmath3 .",
    "the polaritonic frequencies are indicated by black lines , the bare cavity frequency in red and the bare qd frequency in blue . ]",
    "the energy level structure of a strongly coupled system can be described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting the cavity frequency , @xmath6 the quantum dot lowering operator , @xmath2 the detuning between quantum emitter and cavity , @xmath7 the cavity mode operator and @xmath8 the emitter - cavity field coupling strength . including dissipation , the complex eigenenergies @xmath9 of the system are  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath0 corresponds to the rung of the system ( number of excitations ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the cavity and qd energy decay rates , respectively .",
    "the resulting lowest energy levels are depicted in figure  [ fig : figure1](b ) as a function of  @xmath2 .",
    "they consist of pairs of anticrossing branches , the upper polaritons ( up@xmath0 ) and the lower polaritons ( lp@xmath0 ) .",
    "when transitioning through the anticrossing , the polaritons change their character from qd - like / cavity - like to cavity - like / qd - like .",
    "fitting the data results in values of @xmath13  ghz and @xmath14  ghz .",
    "importantly , this type of nanophotonic system operates in the good emitter limit , where @xmath11 is much larger than @xmath12 .",
    "however , in photonic crystal cavity - qd based systems , @xmath12 can be neglected relative to the other rate , since for qds in bulk the radiative lifetime is about @xmath15  ns and even further lengthened by the photonic band gap . instead , the lifetimes of the far detuned polaritons are dominated by phonon bath - induced dephasing processes .",
    "specifically in qd - cavity systems , phonon assisted - population transfer between polaritonic branches is important and well studied  @xcite .",
    "it is very efficient for strongly coupled systems  @xcite and for the system investigated here , we find transfer rates of @xmath16  ghz for detunings in the range of @xmath17 .    as discussed in the introduction , our qd - cavity platform can produce a wide variety of nonclassical light statistics . to visualize this capability , we present in figure  [ fig : figure1](c )",
    "the laser detuning - dependent measured degree of second order coherence @xmath18 $ ] for @xmath3 , obtained using cross - polarized reflectivity  @xcite and a hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) type measurement .",
    "note that due to the extremely fast emission rates of nanophotonic systems , all correlation experiments presented throughout this paper are performed in the pulsed regime , where @xmath18~=~\\langle~m~(~m~-~1)~\\rangle~/~\\langle~m \\rangle^2 $ ] , with @xmath19 signifying the number of detections .",
    "a super - poissonian photon distribution can be found at laser detunings of @xmath20 , known as photon - induced tunneling regime , while a sub - poissonian photon distribution can be found at detunings of @xmath21 , known as photon - blockade regime . in the following sections , we investigate both regimes in more detail and in particular examine the interplay between phonon effects and frequency filtering .",
    "first , we discuss in greater detail the generation of single photons in the photon - blockade regime and provide insight into phonon - assisted processes .",
    "in contrast to our prior photon blockade work , we now consider phonon assisted coupling between dressed ladder eigenstates , which impacts the properties of the single photon generation .",
    "as schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure2](b ) , photon - blockade occurs if the laser is resonant with the first rung of the jc - ladder ( blue upward arrow ) but not resonant with higher rungs of the ladder due to its anharmonicity . in this configuration ,",
    "only single photons can be transmitted . due to the fast dissipation rates of nanophotonic systems , a detuning between qd and cavity of a few",
    "@xmath8 has been shown to be essential for high - fidelity single photon generation  @xcite ; based on this study , we have chosen an optimal detuning of @xmath22 .",
    "the pulse length of the excitation laser has to be chosen to be significantly smaller than the state lifetime to minimize re - excitation during the presence of the excitation pulse  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the pulse needs to be spectrally narrow to avoid unnecessary overlap with subsequent climbs up the ladder .",
    "we determined an optimal compromise at @xmath23  ps which is smaller than the state lifetime of 48.5  ps at this detuning .     and",
    "resonant excitation of up1 with a @xmath23  ps long pulse .",
    "( * b * ) illustration of the jc - ladder .",
    "the excitation laser is resonant with up1 ( depicted with a blue upward arrow ) but not resonant with higher climbs up the ladder .",
    "following excitation of up1 , possible recombination channels are from up1 to the ground state ( blue downward arrow ) or from lp1 to the ground state ( red arrow ) via a phonon - assisted population transfer from up1 to lp1 ( orange ) .",

    "a typical transmission spectrum obtained in this configuration with an excitation pulse area of @xmath24  @xcite is presented in figure  [ fig : figure2](a ) .",
    "the signal is composed of three contributions : emission from the resonantly excited up1 ( schematically illustrated in blue in figure  [ fig : figure2](b ) ) , phonon - assisted emission from lp1 ( schematically illustrated in red in figure  [ fig : figure2](b ) ) and coherent scattering of the excitation laser .",
    "we note here that in this configuration , coherent scattering of the excitation laser would normally dominate the signal .",
    "however , in our case it is largely suppressed due to a self - homodyne suppression ( shs ) effect that results from interference of light scattering from the cavity and continuum modes of the photonic crystal  @xcite .",
    "the relative intensities of up1 and lp1 are mainly given by the ratio of the ( detuning dependent ) radiative transition rate @xmath25 and the phonon - mediated transfer rate @xmath26 ( illustrated in orange in figure 2b ) .",
    "we now investigate the quantum character of the emission through measurements of the degree of second - order coherence .",
    "the result of a measurement without spectral filtering ( similar to our previous bockade results ) is presented in figure  [ fig : figure2](c ) and results in a value of @xmath18~=~0.263~\\pm~0.008 $ ] .",
    "this value is nonzero mainly due to an imperfect suppression of the coherently scattered laser light .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of pulse length ( @xmath23  ps ) to state lifetimes ( @xmath27  ps ) allows for some probability of re - excitation .",
    "next , we present frequency filtered measurements using a spectrometer with a resolution of @xmath28  ghz as a spectral filter .",
    "the result for filtering on the up1 emission ( indicated in blue in figure  [ fig : figure2](a ) ) is presented in figure  [ fig : figure2](d ) and shows values of @xmath18~=~0.162~\\pm~0.016 $ ] . the result for filtering on the lp1 emission ( indicated in red in figure  [ fig : figure2](a ) )",
    "is presented in figure  [ fig : figure2](e ) and shows @xmath18~=~0.063~\\pm~0.010 $ ] .",
    "both values are smaller than the unfiltered measurement due to a reduced contribution of the coherently scattered component . however , since the lp1 emission is spectrally detuned from the laser , the measured value of @xmath18 $ ] is lowest in this case .    in order to determine the relationship between photons emitted at the lp1 and up1 frequencies",
    ", we performed cross - correlation measurements using two spectrometers as spectral filters in front of the two detectors of our hbt setup .",
    "the result of a cross - correlation measurement between up1 and lp1 is presented in figure  [ fig : figure2](f ) and shows clear antibunching with a measured degree of second - order coherence of @xmath18~=~0.079~\\pm~0.018 $ ] .",
    "this value is in between the values obtained for up1 and lp1 , which is consistent with our attribution of non - zero @xmath29 $ ] to coherent laser scattering .",
    "most importantly , it demonstrates that after exciting up1 , emission of a single photon occurs  _ either _ at the up1 energy  _ or _ phonon - mediated via lp1 .",
    "we also note here that measurements with longer pulses ( see supplementary material ) showed qualitatively the same behavior but with higher values of @xmath18 $ ] due to an enhanced probability of re - excitation .    to support our interpretation of the data",
    ", we developed a model based on the measured lifetimes of up1 and lp1 . in our model , the system is initialized to the excited state up1 and then decays via two independent channels , which thus would have zero self- or cross - correlation between intensities . in rate equation form",
    ", the model is given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the population of up1 and lp1 , respectively .",
    "the rates used in the model are the radiative recombination rate @xmath25 from up1 and @xmath33 from lp1 and the phonon - assisted transfer rates from up1 to lp1 ( @xmath34 ) and vice versa ( @xmath35 ) . using this model and the measured rates ( see supplemental material for details ) ,",
    "we calculate that @xmath36 of the emission occurs from lp1 .",
    "a fit to the data of figure  [ fig : figure2](a ) ( shown in the supplementary material ) shows that @xmath37 of the emission occurs at the frequency of lp1 .",
    "this excellent agreement between theory and experiment demonstrates that our model is self - consistent .",
    "we now turn our attention to multi - photon emission @xcite .",
    "we again investigate frequency filtered photon statistics from a detuned strongly coupled system , but with the laser tuned to a multi - photon resonance of the jaynes - cummings system @xcite . as discussed above , photon - induced tunneling describes the enhanced probability of a multi - photon transmission for an excitation laser tuned in between the polaritons of the first rung . this configuration is schematically illustrated by the green arrow in figure  [ fig : figure3](b ) and known to result in super - poissonian counting statistics of the transmitted light  @xcite .",
    "although two- , three- and higher @xmath0- photon resonances are located quite close in frequency , we expect to observe mainly effects from two - photon excitation .",
    "because resonance transition rates scale with the n - th order of the laser power , we expect that for the relatively low powers used in the experiment , the two - photon resonance will completely dominate the emission statistics .    in general , for nanophotonic systems in the photon - tunneling regime ,",
    "the transmission is dominated by coherent scattering of the laser and the probability @xmath38 of obtaining @xmath0 photons in a transmitted pulse only slightly deviates from a coherent beam . especially in the detuned tunneling regime",
    ", this coherent scattering completely dominates the emission even for arbitrarily low powers .",
    "as can be seen from the gray dashed line in figure  [ fig : figure3](a ) , the cavity strongly reflects the laser pulse as to obscure the interesting quantum light emission . therefore to observe non - trivial emission statistics it is critical to employ a self - homodyning interference in order to remove the unwanted coherently scattered light @xcite .     for exciting up2 with a @xmath23  ps long pulse ( gray circles ) fitted with a quantum optical model with ( black line ) and without shs ( gray dashed line ) .",
    "( * b * ) illustration of the jc - ladder .",
    "the resonant two - photon excitation of up2 is depicted with two green arrows .",
    "the most likely relaxation channels are from up2 to up1 ( upper red arrow ) , from up1 to the ground state ( blue arrow ) or from lp1 to the ground state ( lower red arrow ) via a phonon - assisted population transfer from up1 to lp1 ( orange arrow ) .",

    "( * f * ) simulated pulse - wise second - order coherence versus the position of the frequency filter and taking into account the experimental parameters ( note : the laser pulse is tuned approximately to the two - photon resonance ) .",
    "the blue ( red ) dashed line represents the frequency of up1 ( lp1 ) and black circles represent measured values . ]    utilizing this shs effect , a typical spectrum obtained at a detuning of @xmath39 with a pulse length of @xmath23  ps and the excitation laser in resonance with the second rung ( for two - photon excitation ) is presented in figure  [ fig : figure3](a ) as gray circles .",
    "the data is fitted with a quantum optical model ( black line ) , that we will discuss later .",
    "similar to the photon - blockade case , the emission contains three components : emission at the up1 energy , emission at the lp1 energy and coherent scattering from the laser . here",
    ", the detuning is chosen large enough to separate the three components while keeping it small enough to lend oscillator strength from the cavity to enable multi - photon excitation of higher rungs .",
    "now , we discuss a multi - photon tunneling process that is schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure3](b ) : after populating up2 via a two - photon excitation ( two green arrows ) the system mainly relaxes into up1 emitting a photon at the lp1 frequency with the rate @xmath11 .",
    "from there it decays either through emission of a photon at the up1 frequency with the rate @xmath40 or phonon - assisted at the lp1 frequency with the rate @xmath34 .",
    "next , we test if this model is consistent with correlation measurements",
    ". the results of unfiltered and frequency - filtered measurements are presented in figures  [ fig : figure3](c - e ) whereby the filtering frequency is indicated by the colors in figure  [ fig : figure3](a ) .",
    "the measured values for unfiltered , filtered on up1 and filtered on lp1 are @xmath18~=~1.174~\\pm~0.022 $ ] , @xmath18~=~0.332~\\pm~0.028 $ ] and @xmath18~=~1.490~\\pm~0.034 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the observed small bunching value for the unfiltered measurement is consistent with literature and our prior work  @xcite and with the measurement presented in figure  [ fig : figure1](c ) .",
    "the fact that we observe strong antibunching filtered on the up1 frequency is consistent with our proposed model , where independent of which rung is excited , only one photon can be emitted at the up1 frequency per excitation cycle .",
    "the increase in @xmath18 $ ] relative to the case for frequency - filtered photon - blockade results from leakage of the coherently scattered laser component into the detection channel due to its spectral proximity .",
    "importantly , the frequency filtered measurement at the cavity frequency shows strongly enhanced bunching relative to the unfiltered case .    here , we propose a second - order scattering process to interpret these results and use a rate equation model to analyze the dynamics .",
    "the system is initialized to the excited state up2 and then decays via different channels . with this model",
    "we can calculate the population of up2 , lp2 , up1 and lp1 , in our notation labeled @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "this allows us to calculate the radiative emission that occurs from each polariton .",
    "the rate equation model is given by : @xmath45 with @xmath46 representing the following rates : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are the radiative recombination rates of up1 and lp1 , respectively .",
    "the model also includes nonradiative phonon - assisted transfer rates from up@xmath0 to lp@xmath0 ( @xmath50 ) and vice versa ( @xmath51 ) .    using the measured rates at this detuning  @xcite",
    ", we compare the emission intensities at the frequencies of up1 and lp1 estimated from the rate equation model with the ones fitted from the spectrum in figure  [ fig : figure3](a ) . from the model",
    "we calculate that @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the emission occur at the lp1 and up1 frequencies , respectively .",
    "this is good agreement with a fit of the spectrum ( see supplementary material for details ) , where we find that @xmath54 of the emission occur at the lp1 frequency ( red ) , while @xmath55 occur at the up1 frequency ( blue ) .",
    "these findings collectively suggest that indeed our system strongly emits two photons at the lp1 frequency .    in order to gain deeper insight into the emission dynamics of our system and further proof that our system acts as a two - photon source",
    ", we performed quantum optical simulations with the quantum toolbox in python ( qutip )  @xcite , based on the approach presented in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the simulation fully takes into account all known non - idealities relevant to our scenario : pulse - wise correlation calculations  @xcite , phonon - induced polaritonic transfers  @xcite , and self - homodyne suppression  @xcite .",
    "importantly to suggest a strong validity of our approach , only the optical driving strength and optimal shs amplitude were used as fitting parameters .",
    "furthermore , our simulation technique already showed excellent agreement when focusing on the blockade regime and the emission of indistinguishable photons  @xcite .    with the quantum - optical model we fit the resonance fluorescence spectrum in figure  [ fig : figure3](a ) and",
    "then calculate the expected @xmath18 $ ] values as presented in figure  [ fig : figure3](f ) .",
    "the simulated second - order coherence fits almost perfectly to the measured data at the up1 ( blue dashed line ) and the lp1 frequency ( red dashed line ) .",
    "we again emphasize that the self - homodyne suppression effect is of paramount importance for these experiments . without shs ,",
    "the coherently scattered laser light would dominate the spectrum , leading to a poissonian photon distribution , as illustrated by the gray dashed line in figure  [ fig : figure3](a ) .    finding a model that describes the system s behavior",
    "well allows us to make an important insight into the multi - photon emission from our system .",
    "unlike in previous studies of photon - induced tunneling where @xmath56~>~g^{(2)}[0]$ ]  @xcite , our filtered emission both strongly bunches in second - order ( @xmath18~=~1.490~\\pm~0.034 $ ] ) but antibunches in third - order statistics ( @xmath56~=~0.872~\\pm~0.021 $ ] ) .",
    "these values were calculated using a quantum trajectory approach to counting statistics  @xcite .",
    "thus for the first time , we find that an optical solid - state system not only shows a third - order coherence value that is smaller than the second - order coherence value  @xcite , but also a third - order coherence value that shows antibunching in the photon - induced tunneling regime .",
    "this confirms that we have suppressed the three - photon emission from the system and clearly enhanced its two - photon emission .",
    "in this article , we provided further insight into the dynamics of strongly coupled qd - photonic crystal cavity systems for nonclassical light generation . by modifying the excitation laser detuning , we showed that the emitted photon distribution can be tuned from sub- to super - poissonian .",
    "in the photon - blockade regime we addressed the first polaritonic rung with resonant laser pulses and found two decay channels : direct recombination from up1 and phonon - assisted emission from lp1 . in cross - correlation measurements we found strong antibunching , demonstrating for the first time that the system only emits one photon at a time through any of its decay channels .    in the photon - tunneling regime",
    "we excited the second polaritonic rung resonantly and generated photons with a super - poissonian distribution .",
    "we presented a model , where the emission from the system is explained through the subsequent emission of two photons either with or without a phonon - mediated population transfer .",
    "this finding was supported through quantum optical simulations that showed excellent agreement .",
    "furthermore , we calculated a third - order coherence value of @xmath56~=~0.872~\\pm~0.021 $ ] , clearly suggesting so far unprecedented third - order antibunching from an optical solid - state system in the photon - induced tunneling regime , indicating a dominant two - photon component .",
    "we hope that this demonstration of probing the higher rungs of a detuned strongly coupled system provides the groundwork for the emission of higher - order fock states  @xcite from such scalable solid - state systems",
    ". this will be a key element in versatile applications , ranging from quantum computing  @xcite , quantum key distribution  @xcite , quantum metrology and lithography  @xcite to medical imaging  @xcite and quantum biology  @xcite .",
