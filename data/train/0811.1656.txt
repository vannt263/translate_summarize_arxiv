    "the discovery of the high-@xmath5 cuprate was epoch - making in that the material has opened a new avenue of the correlated electron systems and associated electron mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "however , we are still some way from a complete understanding , and a new class of materials has been desired , which would be a testbench for various ideas and concepts , both experimental and theoretical , in the electron correlation .",
    "so the discovery of superconductivity in the iron - based pnictide lafeaso doped with fluorine ( lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ) discovered by hosono s group@xcite is particularly welcome . indeed , this is the the first non - copper family of compounds whose @xmath6 exceeds 50 k in the subsequent studies ( fig.[fig.tc ] ) .",
    "this immediately stimulates renewed interests in the electron mechanism of high @xmath6 superconductivity .",
    "especially interesting , in our view , is that the way in which the correlation effects such as magnetism and superconductivity appear in strongly correlated electron systems is very sensitive to the underlying band structure .",
    "we can envisage to exploit the  fermiology in correlated electron systems \" to explore the possibility of manipulating superconductivity by choosing the shape of the fermi surface.@xcite    , width=328 ]    in this paper we first briefly look at unconventional superconductivity as a background .",
    "we then give a description of the electronic structure and a possible mechanism for superconductivity for the iron - based compound .",
    "theoretically , the material turns out to have a curious multiband structure , with the fermi surface comprising some pockets . in order to investigate the pairing mechanism ,",
    "here we first construct an electronic model for the iron - based compound with the  downfolding \" based on a first - principles electronic structure calculation .",
    "the minimal model turns out to contain all the five fe @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "we then apply the five - band random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to solve the eliashberg equation .",
    "we conclude that a nesting between multiple fermi surface ( pockets ) results in a development of peculiar spin fluctuation modes , which in turn realises an unconventional @xmath8 ( roughly extended @xmath8 ) pairing.@xcite the result is intriguing as one realisation of the idea of fermiology in general and the idea of the  disconnected fermi surface \" in particular@xcite .",
    "finally we shall summarise that , as opposed the strongly correlated , half - filled , one - band cuprate as a doped mott insulator , the iron compound is moderately correlated , dilute multi - band system . an outlook for the iron compound",
    "is also given .",
    "after the discovery of the cuprate , a number of other classes of superconductors have been discovered , among which are the ruthenate , the cobaltate , the hf compound and the ce compound .",
    "these have given a strong impetus towards the study of electron mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "in the conventional mechanism , superconductivity arises from the electron - electron attraction mediated by phonons , where @xmath9 k is one order of magnitude smaller than the phonon energy @xmath10 k. in the electron mechanism , superconductivity arises from the electron - electron repulsion , where spin and charge fluctuations mediate pairing with @xmath11 k , two orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic energy @xmath12 k.    the pairing from repulsive interactions itself is nothing strange , if we allow anisotropic pairing symmetries accompanied by anisotropic gap functions , @xmath13 .",
    "the point is , if we look at the bcs gap equation , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pairing interaction , we can immediately recognise that a repulsion acts as an attraction when @xmath13 changes sign across the typical momentum transfer ( usually dictated by the dominant spin fluctuation mode ) .",
    "this is what is happening in the cuprate with a @xmath7-wave pairing .",
    "the question , then , is  why is @xmath16 in the electron mechanism is so low ? \" , as most transparently displayed by uemura s experimental plot for @xmath5 against @xmath17@xcite .",
    "theoretically , there are good reasons why @xmath5 is low : ( a ) the effective attraction mediated by the fluctuation is much smaller than the bare ( repulsive ) interaction .",
    "( b ) quasi - particles are short - lived due to large self - energy corrections from the electron correlation , and ( c ) the prerequisite anisotropy in pairing with the gap - function nodes , which usually intersect the fermi surface , suppresses @xmath5 .",
    "we can then think of how we can manipulate these factors .",
    "several years ago kuroki and arita@xcite have proposed that we can overcome the difficulty ( c ) by considering _",
    "disconnected _ fermi surfaces , on which we can pierce the nodes in between the fermi pockets .",
    "each pocket is then fully gapped , with opposite signs across the pockets .",
    "while the disconnected fermi surfaces may first seem artificial , it has been recognised that they actually occur in real materials including tmtsf@xcite and co compounds@xcite .    as for the spatial dimensionality , arita et al",
    "have shown that two - dimensional ( layered ) systems are more favourable than 3d ones for the spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity for ordinary lattices@xcite .",
    "this is because the fraction of the phase space over which the pairing interaction is appreciable is larger in 2d .",
    "the result , also obtained by monthoux and lonzarich@xcite , agrees with the empirical fact that recently discovered superconductors ( cuprates , co compound , hf compound , cecoin@xmath18 , etc ) are mostly layer - structured .",
    "the iron - based compound has turned out to be no exception .",
    "lafeaso has a tetragonal layered structure ( fig.[fig.structure ] ) , where each fe layer comprises edge - shared feas@xmath19 tetrahedra with fe atoms forming a square lattice . since the bands around @xmath20 have negligible lao - layer components , we can concentrate on the fe layer .",
    "the experimentally determined lattice constants are @xmath21and @xmath22 , with two internal coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the experimentally obtained phase diagram in the original discovery@xcite and in an @xmath25sr study@xcitearxiv0806.3533 the ( colinear ; see below ) sdw is taken over by the superconducting phase as the f - doping level is increased .    , width=328 ]    after the discovery of superconductivity , a surge of intensive studies on the material has ensued .",
    "since it is impossible to survey them here , let us here mention only a few examples with an extremely partial list of references . in the iron - based family , various compounds",
    "have been shown to exhibit superconductivity , among which are ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1@xcite , prfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1@xcite , gdfeaso@xmath26@xcite , smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1@xcite , with @xmath5 now exceeding 56 k. pressure effects have been studied for lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1@xcite , ndfeaso@xmath26@xcite , etc .",
    "superconductivity has also been found in iron - based materials with different layered structures that include bafe@xmath27as@xmath27@xcite and fese@xcite .",
    "we can first itemise the experimental results that indicate unconventional sc :    1 .",
    "nmr , where absence of coherence peak , @xmath28 , etc have been observed.@xcite 2 .",
    "electronic specific heat @xmath29 , etc has been observed.@xcite 3 .",
    "point - contact tunnelling , where zero - bias peak , indicative of a sign change across fermi pockets , etc have been observed.@xcite 4 .",
    "@xmath25sr is used to measure the superfluid density.@xcite especially interesting is the uemura plot , in which the iron compound is shown to reside more or less on the uemura line , so in this sense the iron compound is at least as good as the cuprate .",
    "raman spectra indicate a weak electron - phonon coupling.@xcite 6 .",
    "@xmath30 indicate a two - gap behaviour.@xcite 7 .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy,@xcite and more recently arpes depict the fermi surface , gap , etc@xcite .",
    "experimental results for magnetic properties , especially interesting in relation to the mechanism of superconductivity , include the following :    1 .",
    "mssbauer studies indicate a magnetic transition temperature @xmath31 k with a magnetic moment @xmath32 ( at @xmath33 k)@xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction studies indicate a colinear ( stripe ) sdw ( see fig.[fig.chis ] ) in fe moments with @xmath34 k , @xmath35 ( at @xmath36 k)@xcite .",
    "3 .   @xmath25sr suggests a spontaneous muon spin precession below @xmath37 k@xcite .",
    "nmr shows @xmath38 k@xcite .",
    "transport measurements indicate an anomaly around @xmath39 k@xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction shows a structural phase transition ( tetragonal @xmath40 orthorhombic ) at @xmath41 k@xcite , which is close to , but somewhat deviates from , the magnetic transition temperature .",
    "theoretically , if we first look at the periodic table , copper , in its cu@xmath42 state , has a @xmath43 electron configuration .",
    "this makes the cuprate one - band , nearly half - filled system , where we have a spin 1/2 at each site with strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "by contrast , fe , located in the middle of the table , has a @xmath44 configuration , so multiple @xmath7 bands tend to be involved .",
    "a point of interest is that we usually associate iron with ferromagnetism rather than with superconductivity@xcite , and how the multiband structure for the iron compound gives rise to superconductivity .",
    "we then definitely require the electronic band structure to begin with .    *",
    "several groups have obtained the band structure@xcite .",
    "* theoretical suggestiongs on magnetic properties include an lda+dmft study which indicates no local moment for the hund s coupling @xmath45 ev@xcite .",
    "* an _ ab initio _",
    "( crpa ) calculation estimats @xmath46 ev.@xcite * an itinerant charachter of the compound suggested from several papers@xcite . *",
    "sensitivity of the electronic structure against the fe - as distance has been suggested in a maximally localised wannier study that incorporates as @xmath47 orbitals@xcite .",
    "first two papers that study the mechanism of superconductivity are by mazin et al@xcite and by kuroki et al@xcite .",
    "the former starts from the fermi surface and construct a an effective rpa treatment for the spin susceptibility @xmath48 $ ] to predict the colinear sdw and an extended s - wave pairing .",
    "the latter starts with a model building via downfolding to actually solve eliashberg s equation for the full five - band model .",
    "here we briefly describe this approach .     in lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 with 10 % doping ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "right panel : fermi surface ( with the inter - layer hopping ignored ) .",
    "[ fig.dispersion],width=328 ]    , width=328 ]    the approach starts from a band structure ( figs.[fig.dispersion ] , [ fig.character ] ) with the density - functional approximation with plane - wave basis@xcite for constructing the model .",
    "for that , we have employed a standard procedure with maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs)@xcite .",
    "these mlwfs , centred at the two fe sites in the unit cell , have five orbital symmetries ( orbital 1 : @xmath50 , 2 : @xmath51 , 3 : @xmath52 , 4 : @xmath53 , 5 : @xmath54 ) . due to the tetrahedral coordination of as , there are two fe atoms per unit cell , and @xmath55 refer to those in the original unit cell .",
    "the two wannier orbitals in each unit cell are equivalent in that each fe atom has the same local arrangement of other atoms .",
    "we can thus take a unit cell that contains only one orbital per symmetry by unfolding the brillouin zone ( bz ) , and we end up with an effective five - band model on a square lattice , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 axes are rotated by 45 degrees from @xmath58-@xmath59 , to which we refer for all the wave vectors hereafter .",
    "we define the band filling @xmath60 as the number of electrons / number of sites ( e.g. , @xmath61 for full filling ) .",
    "the doping level @xmath56 in lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 is related to the band filling as @xmath62 .",
    "the five bands are heavily entangled as shown in fig.[fig.character ] , which reflects hybridisation of the five @xmath63 orbitals due to the tetrahedral coordination of as @xmath47 orbitals around fe .",
    "hence we conclude that the minimal electronic model requires all the five bands.@xcite in fig.[fig.character ] , the fermi surface for @xmath64 ( corresponding to @xmath49 ) obtained by ignoring the inter - layer hoppings is shown in the two - dimensional unfolded bz .",
    "the shape of the fermi surface is now being experimentally detected with arpes.@xcite    the fermi surface consists of four pieces ( pockets in 2d when the inter - layer hoppings are neglected ) : two concentric hole pockets ( denoted as @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) centred around @xmath67 , two electron pockets around @xmath68 @xmath69 or @xmath70 @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "@xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) corresponds to the fermi surface around the @xmath74z ( ma ) line ( in the original bz ) in singh s band calculation.@xcite in addition , we notice that a portion of the band near @xmath75 is flat and touches the @xmath20 at @xmath64 , so that the portion acts as a `` quasi fermi surface @xmath76 '' around @xmath75 .",
    "the orbital character is again entangled : @xmath77 and portions of @xmath78 near bz edge has mainly @xmath51 and @xmath52 character , while the portions of @xmath78 away from the bz edge and @xmath79 have mainly @xmath53 orbital character .",
    "having constructed the model , we move on to the rpa calculation in the 2d model . for the many - body part of the hamiltonian , we consider the standard interaction terms that comprise the intra - orbital coulomb @xmath80 , the inter - orbital coulomb @xmath81 , the hund s coupling @xmath82 , and the pair - hopping @xmath83 .",
    "the modification of the band structure due to the self - energy correction is not taken into account .",
    "for the five - band model , green s function is a @xmath84 matrix in the orbital representation , while each of the spin and orbital susceptibilities @xmath85 is a @xmath86 matrix .",
    "the green s function and the effective pairing interactions , obtained from the susceptibilities , are plugged into the linearised eliashberg equation , and the gap function as a @xmath84 matrix is obtained along with the eigenvalue @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 @xmath89-point meshes and 1024 matsubara frequencies are taken .",
    "we find that the spin fluctuations dominate over orbital fluctuations as far as @xmath90 , so we can characterise the system with the spin susceptibility .",
    "we denote the largest eigenvalue of the spin susceptibility matrix for @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "the gap function matrix at the lowest matsubara frequency is transformed into the band representation by a unitary transformation , and its diagonal element for band @xmath93 is denoted as @xmath94 .",
    "f@xmath1 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( in ev ) .",
    "bottom panels depict the colinear sdw for @xmath99 .",
    "[ fig.chis],width=264 ]     ( left ) and @xmath100 ( right ) in the 5-band rpa for 10% doped lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 for the same parameter set as in the previous figure .",
    "nesting vectors are indicated in the top panels .",
    "[ fig.gap],width=340 ]    let us look at the result for the spin susceptibility @xmath101 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( all in units of ev ) in fig.[fig.chis ] .",
    "the spin susceptibility has peaks around @xmath102 , @xmath70 ( i.e. , a colinear sdw ) , which reflects the fermi surface nesting around @xmath103 across @xmath77 and @xmath78 and also @xmath78 and @xmath79 in fig.[fig.character ] .",
    "the spin structure is consistent with the neutron scattering experiments in which the colinear structure is observed at low temperatures for the undoped case.@xcite    for superconductivity , we show in fig.[fig.gap ] the diagonal elements of the gap function matrix for orbitals @xmath52 , @xmath104 , and @xmath53 . the gap is a curious extended @xmath8-wave,@xcite where the gap changes sign across the @xmath105 or @xmath106 nesting vector @xmath103 at which the spin fluctuations develop .",
    "the sign change is analogous to those in models studied by bulut _",
    "et al._,@xcite and kuroki and arita@xcite . to be more precise for the multiband system , the magnitude of gap of the @xmath53 orbital turns out to be large compared to other orbitals , which indicates that the @xmath53 orbitals play the main role in the superconductivity .",
    "the extended s ( @xmath107 in @xmath89 space ) should look in real space as depicted in fig.[fig.gaprealspace ] .",
    "-space ( top panels ) and in the real space ( bottom ) .",
    "[ fig.gaprealspace],width=328 ]    however , we have to be careful in analysing the gap , since we have a multiband system at hand , where the band character changes along the fermi surface ( fig.[fig.character ] ) .",
    "when we concentrate on the main component ( @xmath53 orbitals ) of the gap function , the magnitude of the gap varies along the @xmath78 fermi surface , which is because the character of the fermi surface changes , as we approach the bz boundary , to @xmath52 , @xmath104 for which the gap is smaller .",
    "more importantly , we should always be aware that the gap function is a 5@xmath45 matrix , where off - diagonal elements are rather significant due to the heavy entanglement of the bands .",
    "this should have experimental implications for various quantities .",
    "an importance of matrix character of the gap is illustrated in fig.[fig.delta44 ] that displays the quantity @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the gap matrix and 44 denotes the diagonal element of band 4 .",
    "as shown in the figure , this quantity is fully gapped over the entire bz .",
    "a remnant of the nodal lines of the diagonal element appears as a dip that intersects the @xmath78 fermi surface , which may look like a node e.g. at not low enough temperatures .",
    "the degree of the variation of the gap may be determined experimentally from e.g. tunnelling spectroscopy or arpes .",
    "also interesting is how the penetration depth , @xmath110 with @xmath111 being the superfluid density in the one - band system , should be given in the multiband system .",
    "for the same parameter set as in the previous figures .",
    "[ fig.delta44],width=207 ]",
    "to summarise , we have very briefly reviewed the iron compound , and then described a theory in which a five - band electronic model is constructed as a minimum microscopic model . applying a five - band rpa to this model , we have found that spin fluctuation modes around @xmath112 develop due to the nesting between disconnected fermi surfaces .",
    "based on the linearised eliashberg equation , we have concluded that spin fluctuation modes realise an unconventional , extended @xmath8-wave pairing , where the diagonal elements of the gap matrix change sign across the nesting vector .",
    "the @xmath53 orbital is the main component in the superconductivity gap function , although the gap function as a @xmath84 matrix may be important .",
    "overall , while the cuprate is strongly correlated ( @xmath113 with @xmath114 the band width ) , one - band and nearly half - filled system , the iron compound is moderately correlated ( @xmath115)@xcite , multi - band and dilutely filled system .",
    "this poses a challenging problem of whether the iron compound can exceed the cuprate .",
    "relevance to experimental results , especially @xmath25sr including the uemura plot , is also a pressing future problem .",
    "the work described here is a collaboration with kazuhiko kuroki , seiichiro onari , ryotaro arita , hidetomo usui , yukio tanaka and hiroshi kontani .",
