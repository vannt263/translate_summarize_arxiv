    "on april 1 , 1996 , solar neutrino research shifted from the pioneering phase of the chlorine ( homestake ) experiment  @xcite and the exploratory phase of the kamiokande  @xcite , sage  @xcite , and gallex  @xcite experiments , to the era of precision measurements inaugurated by the superkamiokande  @xcite experiment . in this paper , we concentrate on the predictions for ` smoking - gun ' evidence of new neutrino physics that can be observed in electron - neutrino scattering experiments like superkamiokande .",
    "there are four generic oscillation solutions ( lma , sma , and low msw solutions and vacuum oscillations , cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ) of the solar neutrino problems that involve two neutrinos .",
    "these solutions are all consistent with the predictions of the standard solar model  @xcite and the observed average event rates in the chlorine , kamiokande , superkamiokande , gallex , and sage experiments .",
    "we limit ourselves to such globally consistent oscillation solutions and adopt the methodology used in our recent paper  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results from superkamiokande  @xcite provide some encouragement for considering the lma solution of the msw effect  @xcite .",
    "no statistically significant distortion of the recoil electron energy spectrum has been discovered .",
    "no obvious change has been revealed in the slope of the ratio [ measurement/(standard spectrum ) ] as the superkamiokande measurements have been extended to progressively lower energies .",
    "moreover , the excess of events at the highest energies has diminished .",
    "a larger flux has been observed at night than during the day , although the difference observed by superkamiokande  @xcite ( which is about the size of what is expected from the lma solution ) is only @xmath7 after @xmath8 days of data collection  @xcite . in addition , no large enhancement of the rate has been found when the neutrino trajectories cross the earth s core .",
    "moreover , the excess that is found appears already when the sun is just below the horizon .",
    "these results are , as we shall see in detail in this paper , expected on the basis of the lma msw solution but are not expected on the basis of the sma solution .",
    "there are also some non - solar indications that large mixing angles may be plausible .",
    "first , and most important , superkamiokande and other experiments on atmospheric neutrinos have provided strong evidence that large lepton mixing is occurring at least in one channel involving muon neutrinos  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the mass required for the lma solution ( @xmath9 ) is only one order of magnitude smaller than the mass scale suggested by atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "all of the other solar neutrino solutions imply a smaller or much smaller neutrino mass scale for solar neutrinos .",
    "it is however well known that a weak mass hierarchy allows a rather natural explanation of large mixing .",
    "the oscillation parameters of the lma solar neutrino solution can give an observable effect for atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "in particular , the lma solution could explain  @xcite the excess of @xmath10like events in the atmospheric data .    in this paper",
    ", we provide accurate calculations for smoking - gun predictions of the lma solution , including a simple new test ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : spectrumsolar ] ) .",
    "in particular , we calculate and compare with superkamiokande observations the following quantities : ( 1 ) the distortion of the electron recoil energy spectrum ; ( 2 ) the zenith angle dependence of the observed counting rate ; ( 3 ) the day - night spectrum test ; and ( 4 ) the seasonal dependence ( beyond the effect of the earth s eccentric orbit ) of the counting rate .",
    "all of these quantities are zero , independent of solar physics , if the standard model for electroweak interactions is correct .",
    "therefore , measurements of the spectral energy distortion and the zenith angle and seasonal dependences constitute sensitive smoking - gun tests of new physics . as a cautionary example",
    ", we also simulate the effect of an energy calibration error on the apparent distortion of the electron recoil energy spectrum .",

    "the observation of a distortion in the recoil electron energy spectrum produced by solar neutrinos scattering off electrons would be a definitive signature of physics beyond the standard electroweak model .",
    "neutrinos which correspond to recoil electrons with energies between @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev , which are most easily observed by the superkamiokande solar neutrino experiment  @xcite , are predicted by the standard solar model to be essentially all ( more than 99% ) from @xmath33b beta decay  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the @xmath33b neutrino energy spectrum can be determined accurately from laboratory measurements  @xcite and the influence of astrophysical factors is less than @xmath37 part in @xmath38 @xcite . for energies relevant to solar neutrino studies ,",
    "the cross - sections for neutrino scattering have been calculated accurately in the standard electroweak model , including radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if nothing happens to solar neutrinos on the way from the region of production in the solar interior to a detector on earth , the recoil electron energy spectrum from @xmath33b neutrinos can be calculated precisely .",
    "any measured deviation of the recoil electron energy spectrum from the standard shape would indicate new physics .",
    "the opposite , however , is not true : the absence of a measured distortion does not mean the absence of new physics .",
    "we first indicate in sec .",
    "[ subsec : convolution ] how the neutrino energy spectrum is convolved with the electron recoil energy spectrum and with the measurement characteristics of the detector .",
    "we then summarize briefly in sec .",
    "[ subsec : summaryofdata ] the characteristics of the measured superkamiokande energy spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : energyerror ] , we answer the question : how does an error in the energy calibration affect the shape of the recoil energy spectrum ? we discuss in sec .",
    "[ subsec : predictedvsspectra ] the comparison of the predicted and the measured electron energy spectra , which are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : specconsttheta ] .",
    "we concentrate in this paper on analyzing the ratio , @xmath39 , of the number of observed events , @xmath40 in a given energy bin , @xmath41 , to the number , @xmath42 , expected from the ssm  @xcite , where    @xmath43    for specific applications , we use the observed event numbers in the form provided by superkamiokande  @xcite ; there are @xmath44 energy bins of @xmath45 mev width from @xmath46 mev to @xmath3 mev and an @xmath47th bin that includes all events from @xmath3 mev to @xmath48 mev . when more data are available , it will be important to divide the events above @xmath3 mev into several different bins  @xcite .",

    "( [ numberi ] ) can be taken to be @xmath62 mev . including the effects of the finite energy resolution , the upper limit over the measured electron recoil energy , @xmath63 ,",

    "( [ numberi ] ) to calculate the combined prediction for the standard electroweak model and the standard solar model , set @xmath64 .",
    "the second term in the brackets of eq .",
    "( [ numberi ] ) then disappears .",
    "this term is also absent if the electron neutrinos are converted to sterile neutrinos .",
    "how does the convolution shown in eq .",
    "( [ numberi ] ) affect energy - dependent distortions ( or conversions ) of the incoming electron neutrinos ? the convolution spreads out over a relatively wide energy range any energy - dependent features .",
    "in particular , the scattering process produces electrons with energies from zero to almost equal to the incoming neutrino energy ( for neutrino energies much greater than the electron mass ) .",
    "if @xmath65 are converted to @xmath66 or / and @xmath67 , then there will be neutral current scattering [ the second term in boxed brackets of eq .",
    "( [ numberi ] ) ] which , while less probable , will also reduce the apparent effect of the conversion .",
    "since the solar @xmath33b neutrino spectrum decreases rapidly beyond about @xmath68 mev , a distortion of the recoil electron spectrum at some energy @xmath69 ( @xmath70 mev ) is determined by the distortion of the neutrino spectrum at somewhat lower energy @xmath71 .",
    "the energy resolution function has a crucial affect in smearing out distortion .",
    "the @xmath72 width for the energy resolution is about @xmath73 mev at @xmath74 mev in superkamiokande  @xcite .",
    "smaller features will be smeared out .",
    "after @xmath8 days of data taking with superkamiokande , no unequivocal distortion of the electron recoil energy spectrum has been found .",
    "the data show essentially the spectrum shape expected for no distortion for @xmath75 mev with some excess events at @xmath76 mev .",
    "the excess electrons observed at higher energies may reflect : ( 1 ) a statistical fluctuation ; ( 2 ) the contribution of @xmath77 neutrinos  @xcite ; ( 3 ) a larger - than - expected error in the absolute energy normalization ; or ( 4 ) new physics .",
    "the systematic effects due to @xmath77 neutrinos or to an error in the energy normalization can hide a distortion due to neutrino conversion or cause an artificial distortion .",
    "for example , a suppression due to oscillations of the high energy part of the electron spectrum could be compensated for ( hidden by ) the effect of _ hep _ neutrinos .",
    "all of the four explanations for the high - energy excess have been described previously in the literature .",
    "however , the distortion due to an error in the absolute energy scale of the electrons has only been mentioned as a possibility  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ subsec : energyerror ] the effect on the energy spectrum of an error in the absolute energy scale .",
    "another possible systematic error , a non - gaussian tail to the energy resolution , could also produce an apparent distortion at the highest energies .",
    "however , this effect has been estimated by the superkamiokande collaboration and found to be small  @xcite .    to resolve the ambiguity at high recoil electron energies",
    ", one can proceed in at least two different ways .",
    "( 1 ) one can exclude the spectral data above @xmath36 mev , since the distortion due to both @xmath77 neutrinos and the calibration of the energy scale normalization occur mainly at high energies .",
    "a comparison of the results of the analysis using all the data with the inferences reached using only data below @xmath36 mev provides an estimate of the possible influence of systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , this procedure does throw away some important data .",
    "( 2 ) one can treat the solar @xmath77 neutrino flux as a free parameter in analyzing the energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "in general , this is the preferred method of analysis and the one which we follow .",
    "an error in the absolute normalization of the energy of the recoil electrons , @xmath78 , would lead to an apparent energy dependence in @xmath79 that is particularly important for the lma solution , since the theoretical prediction is that @xmath79 is essentially constant in the higher energy region accessible to superkamiokande .",
    "the ratio @xmath80 can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the standard model spectrum . since @xmath83 , @xmath84 and , in general , @xmath85 all depend on energy , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : absolute ] ) gives rise to an apparent distortion of the observable spectrum .",
    "moreover , since @xmath82 is a decreasing function of energy , @xmath86 increases with energy for negative @xmath85 .",
    "thus , for negative @xmath85 , @xmath80 is enhanced at high energies .",
    "the superkamiokande collaboration has estimated the error in the absolute energy calibration as being @xmath87 at 10 mev  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "we have simulated the effect of an error in the absolute energy calibration by convolving a standard model recoil energy spectrum with the energy resolution function of superkamiokande and introducing a constant offset error @xmath90 .",
    "we calculated the ratio @xmath80 directly from the equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : absolute ] ) , without making the approximation involved in the taylor - series expansion .",
    "figure  [ fig : energyerror ] compares the computed @xmath80 for three different values of @xmath90 with the observed superkamiokande data  @xcite for @xmath8 days . for visual convenience ,",
    "each curve is normalized somewhat differently , but all are normalized within the range allowed by the superkamiokande measurement of the total rate .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : energyerror ] that a @xmath72 ( @xmath91 kev ) energy calibration error can produce a significant pseudo - slope .",
    "more exotic effects can be produced if the one assumes that the energy error , @xmath90 , is itself a function of energy .",
    "we conclude that future analyses of the distortion of the energy spectrum should include @xmath90 as one of the parameters that is allowed to vary in determining from the measurements the best - fit and the uncertainty in the energy distortion .",
    "figure  [ fig : specconsttheta ] compares the predicted versus the measured ratio @xmath80 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdefinition ] ) ] of the electron recoil energy spectra for a representative range of @xmath25 that spans the domain permitted by the global lma solutions .",
    "all of the solutions shown have @xmath30 and are consistent with the average event rates in the chlorine , kamiokande , sage , gallex , and superkamiokande experiments .",
    "also , all of the histograms of neutrino solutions are normalized so as to yield the same value of the ratio @xmath80 at @xmath92 mev .",
    "the measured values are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the most conspicuous feature of fig .  [ fig : specconsttheta ] is the flatness of the ratio @xmath80 that is predicted by the lma solution with no enhancement of the @xmath77 flux .",
    "the survival probability , @xmath93 , without earth regeneration is @xmath94 in the observable high energy part of the @xmath33b neutrino spectrum .",
    "regeneration in the earth can lead to a weak increase of the survival probability with energy .",
    "excellent fits to the recoil energy spectra can be obtained by increasing the production cross section for the @xmath77 flux by a factor of @xmath68 to @xmath95 over its nominal ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) best value .",
    "this result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : specconsttheta ] .    results similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : specconsttheta ] are obtained if @xmath24 is allowed to vary over a representative range of the allowed global lma solutions that are consistent with the average measured event rates .",
    "we find numerically that the dependence of the shape of the predicted spectrum upon @xmath24 is very weak .",
    "recent work by the superkamiokande collaboration has placed an experimental upper limit on the @xmath77 neutrino flux at earth of at most @xmath48 times the nominal standard value  @xcite .",
    "the fits shown in fig .  [ fig : specconsttheta ] demonstrate that we require a @xmath77 flux at the sun of @xmath68 to @xmath95 times the standard value .",
    "however , lma neutrino oscillations reduce the rate at the earth so that the observed rate is about a factor of two less than would correspond to a flux of purely @xmath65 @xmath77 neutrinos .",
    "so the fits shown for variable @xmath77 flux in fig .  [ fig : specconsttheta ] and are consistent with the superkamiokande upper limit on the measured @xmath77 flux .",
    "what are the chances that superkamiokande can obtain smoking - gun evidence for a distortion of the energy spectrum if the lma solution is correct ?",
    "the lack of knowledge of the @xmath77 production cross section prevents fundamental conclusions based upon the suggestive higher energy ( @xmath96 mev ) events .",
    "the data reported by superkamiokande ( at the time this paper is being written ) above @xmath3 mev are in a single bin ( @xmath3 mev to @xmath48 mev ) . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible that measurements in smaller energy bins above @xmath3 mev could reduce the uncertainty in the @xmath77 flux and test the consistency of the lma plus enhanced @xmath77 predictions ( for preliminary results see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for larger allowed values of @xmath25 ,",
    "the distortion curve turns up at low energies ( cf .",
    "[ fig : specconsttheta ] ) .",
    "this upturn is due to the fact that for larger @xmath25 the low energy part of the @xmath33b neutrino spectrum ( @xmath97 mev ) is on the adiabatic edge of the suppression pit . for the smallest allowed @xmath25",
    ", lma predicts a weak positive slope for @xmath80 that is caused by the earth regeneration effect .    the predicted distortion at low energies , between , e.g. , @xmath35 mev and @xmath1 mev , is small ( typically @xmath98 a few percent up to as large as @xmath68 percent , cf .",
    "[ fig : specconsttheta ] ) and would require approximately @xmath68 years of superkamiokande data in order to show up in a clear way .",
    "if msw conversions occur , the sun is predicted to be brighter at night in neutrinos than it is during the day  @xcite at those energies at which the survival probability of @xmath65 is less than one - half .",
    "this phenomenon , if observed , would be a dramatic smoking - gun indication of new physics independent of solar models .",

    "therefore , in principle one could distinguish between vacuum oscillations and lma oscillations by comparing the seasonal dependence observed during daytime with the seasonal dependence observed at night .",
    "the lma solution predicts for experiments measuring the low energy @xmath120be neutrino line ( borexino , kamland , lens ) that there will not be a significant contribution to the seasonal effect beyond that expected from the eccentricity of the earth s orbit .",
    "this is because the day - night difference is very small at low energies in the lma solution  @xcite . for vacuum oscillations",
    ", there can be significant seasonal dependences of the @xmath120be line in addition to the purely geometrical effect .",
    "superkamiokande data can be used to test for an enhancement of the seasonal variations as the energy threshold for selecting events is increased .",
    "such an enhancement might be produced by vacuum oscillations .",
    "vacuum oscillations with @xmath121 , which give the best description of the recoil energy spectrum , provide a distinct pattern for the enhancement : the effect of eccentricity is larger than the effect of oscillations for a threshold energy of @xmath1 mev , while the effect of oscillations is comparable with the eccentricity effect for a threshold of @xmath122 mev  @xcite .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : seasonal11pt5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : seasonal ] , we see that the enhancement with energy threshold predicted by lma is weaker than for vacuum oscillations . for lma",
    ", the increase in the threshold only enhances the seasonal variations by of order @xmath123% to @xmath95% of an already small effect .",
    "this insensitivity to changes in energy threshold is in agreement with our calculations of the day and night recoil energy spectra ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : swvsdn ] ) .    practically speaking , lma predicts for superkamiokande that there will be no measurable change in the seasonal effect with increasing energy threshold .",
    "the large mixing angle solution is consistent with all the available data from solar neutrino experiments .",
    "figure  [ fig : zoom ] shows the allowed region of the lma parameters in the approximation of two oscillating neutrinos .",
    "we have investigated in this paper the lma predictions for superkamiokande of the distortion of the electron recoil energy spectrum , the integrated day - night effect , the zenith - angle dependence of the event rate , and the seasonal dependences .",
    "we have also evaluated and discussed an independent test , which we call the day - night spectrum test . finally , we have analyzed the possibilities for distinguishing between lma and vacuum oscillations ( see table  [ tab : confrontation ] and the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : vacuumvslmaseasonal ] ) .",
    "we previously showed that the lma solution is globally consistent with the measured rates in the chlorine , kamiokande , sage , gallex , and superkamiokande experiments  @xcite .",
    "the electron recoil energy spectrum predicted by the lma solution is practically undistorted at energies above @xmath124 mev , i.e. , the @xmath65 survival probability is essentially independent of energy at high energies .",
    "however , the recoil energy spectrum that is measured by superkamiokande suggests an increased rate , relative to the standard recoil energy spectrum , for energies above @xmath36 mev  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : summaryofdata ] two experimental possibilities for explaining the upturn at large energies of the recoil energy spectrum : ( 1 ) a statistical fluctuation that will go away as the data base is increased ; and ( 2 ) an error in the absolute energy calibration . figure  [ fig : energyerror ] shows that a best - fit to the upturn at large energies would require a several sigma error in the absolute energy calibration .",
    "both of these seemingly unlikely possibilities , a large statistical fluctuation and a large error in the energy calibration , will be tested by future measurements with superkamiokande .",
    "there are at least two possibilities for explaining the spectral upturn that do not involve experimental errors or statistical fluctuations : ( 1 ) a @xmath77 flux that is approximately @xmath68 to @xmath123 times larger than the conventional nuclear physics estimate ; and ( 2 ) vacuum oscillations .",
    "we have concentrated in this paper on the explanation that invokes a larger - than - standard @xmath77 flux .",
    "our results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : specconsttheta ] even when the enhanced rate is used in the calculations , the @xmath77 neutrinos are so rare that they do not effect anything measurable except the energy spectrum .    at energies below @xmath124 mev ,",
    "the lma solution predicts a slight upturn in the recoil energy spectrum relative to the standard model energy spectrum .",
    "this effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : specconsttheta ] and may be detectable in the future with much improved statistics .    however , fig .",
    "[ fig : energyerror ] shows that even a modest error in the absolute energy calibration could give rise to an apparently significant energy distortion . in future analyses , it will be important to include the absolute energy calibration error as one of the parameters that is allowed to vary in determining the best fit and the uncertainty in the spectrum shape .",
    "the zenith - angle dependence and the integrated day - night effect observed by superkamiokande are consistent with the predictions of the lma and , in fact , show a hint of an effect ( @xmath7 ) that is predicted by lma oscillations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and eq .",
    "[ eq : daynightasym ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : zenith ] and [ fig : zenithconstm ] show that the predicted and the observed nighttime enhancement are both relatively flat , approximately independent of the zenith angle .",
    "moreover , all five of the measured nighttime rates are above the average daytime rate .",
    "however , the results are not very significant statistically . if the lma description is correct , then another @xmath35 to @xmath68 years of superkamiokande data taking will be required in order to reveal a several standard deviation effect .",
    "the difference between the daytime and the nighttime recoil energy spectra may be detectable in the future . figure  [ fig : daynightspect ] shows separately the predicted day and the predicted night spectral energy distributions .",
    "the most useful way to test for differences between the shapes of the daytime and the nighttime energy spectra is to normalize both spectra to the same value .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffdaynightspect ] shows the predicted difference between the spectra observed during the day and the spectra observed at night .",
    "it will be extremely interesting to test the hint that a day - night effect has been observed with superkamiokande by comparing , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffdaynightspect ] , the equally - normalized day and night spectra .",
    "the simplest way of performing this test would be to compare the total area of the energy spectrum that is observed below @xmath68 mev at night with the total area observed below @xmath68 mev during the day .",
    "the predicted average difference in the day - night spectrum test is about @xmath125% for @xmath29 and decreases to @xmath126% for @xmath127 .    if the lma solution is correct , then when the day and night spectra are normalized so that they have equal total areas , then the area under the daytime spectrum curve below @xmath68 mev must be larger than the area of the nighttime spectrum below @xmath68 mev .",
    "no significant difference between the daytime and the nighttime spectra is expected if vacuum oscillations are the correct solution of the solar neutrino problems .",
    "seasonal differences are predicted to be small for the lma solution .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : asymmetryidentity ] ) shows that seasonal differences are expected to be reduced relative to the day - night asymmetry by a factor of order of @xmath128 for the location of superkamiokande , i.e. , the difference between the average length of the night in the winter and the summer divided by @xmath129 hours .",
    "the predicted and the observed seasonal dependences are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seasonalno ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : seasonal ] .",
    "if the lma solution is correct , it will require many years of superkamiokande measurements in order to detect a statistically significant seasonal dependence .      if there is new physics in the neutrino sector , then experimentalists need to provide two different levels of evidence in order to `` solve '' the solar neutrino problems .",
    "first , measurements must be made that are inconsistent with standard electroweak theory at more than the @xmath130 level of significance .",
    "second , diagnostic measurements must be made that uniquely select a single non - standard neutrino solution .",
    "we are much of the way toward completing the first requirement in a global sense .",
    "a number of authors have shown  @xcite that an arbitrary linear combination of fluxes from different solar nuclear reactions , each with an undistorted neutrino energy spectrum , is inconsistent at about @xmath130 or more with a global description of all of the available solar neutrino data .",
    "the data sets used in these calculations have gradually been expanded to include the results of all five solar neutrino experiments : homestake , kamiokande , sage , gallex , and superkamiokande .",
    "the results have become stronger as more data were added .",
    "the precise agreement  @xcite of the calculated sound speeds of the standard solar model with the measured helioseismological data has provided a further argument in support of the conclusion that some new physics is occurring .",
    "however , we do not yet have a measurement of a smoking - gun phenomenon , seen in a single experiment , that is by itself significant at a many sigma level of significance .",
    "this has been the goal of the current generation of solar neutrino experiments .",
    "what can we say about the possibility of achieving this goal with superkamiokande ?",
    "there may of course be new physical phenomena that have not been anticipated theoretically and which will show up with a high level of significance in the superkamiokande experiment .",
    "we can not say anything about this possibility .",
    "if the lma description of solar neutrinos is correct , we can use the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyerror]fig .",
    "[ fig : seasonal11pt5 ] to estimate how long superkamiokande must be operated in order to reduce the errors so that a single effect ( spectrum distortion , zenith - angle dependence , or seasonal dependence ) is significant at more than the @xmath130 level .",
    "figures  [ fig : energyerror][fig : seasonal11pt5 ] show that the errors must be reduced for any one phenomenon by at least a factor of two in order to reach a multi - sigma level of significance .",
    "since the available data comprise @xmath8 days of operation , over a calendar period of order three years , it seems likely that superkamiokande will require of order a decade of running in order to isolate a single direct proof of solar neutrino oscillations , provided the lma description is correct .",
    "fortunately , superkamiokande can make a global test of the standard electroweak hypothesis that nothing happens to neutrinos after they are created in the center of the sun .",
    "this global test could become significant at the several sigma level within a few years even if lma is correct .",
    "for example , the combined effect of the zenith - angle dependence plus a possible spectral distortion at low energies might show up as a clear signal . or , both the integrated day - night effect and the day - night spectrum test could be observed .",
    "the combined statistical significance of several difference tests could be very powerful . with the great precision and the high statistical significance of the superkamiokande data ,",
    "we think that there is a good chance that a many sigma result may be obtainable in a relatively few years .",
    "_ note added in proof .",
    "_ recently , the superkamiokande collaboration has made available the data for @xmath131 days of observations ( t. kajita , talk given at the second int .",
