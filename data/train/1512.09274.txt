    "the production of particles at forward rapidity is an important tool to study gluon saturation since it probes the target at very small @xmath1 . in particular ,",
    "the charm quark mass being of the same order of magnitude as the saturation scale , forward @xmath0 production should be sensitive to these dynamics .",
    "in addition , the charm quark mass is also large enough to provide a hard scale , making a perturbative treatment possible . on the experimental side ,",
    "@xmath0 production has been the subject of many studies , providing a lot of data to confront theory with experiment .    in a recent work  @xcite we studied , in the color glass condensate ( cgc )",
    "framework , the production of forward @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc .",
    "we showed that , when using the glauber approach to generalize the dipole cross section of a proton to the one of a nucleus , the nuclear suppression for minimum bias events is smaller than in previous cgc calculations such as  @xcite and much closer to experimental data . here",
    "we will study the centrality dependence of the nuclear suppression in this model .",
    "this observable was recently studied at the lhc by the alice collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the formalism for gluon and quark pair production in the dilute - dense limit of the cgc has been studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and used in several works , such as  @xcite .",
    "this allows to compute the cross section for @xmath2 pair production , which can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and is the key ingredient to study @xmath0 production . to describe the hadronization of the @xmath2 pairs into @xmath0 mesons",
    ", we will use the simple color evaporation model in which a fixed fraction of the @xmath2 pairs produced below the @xmath3-meson threshold in either the color singlet or octet state is assumed to hadronize into @xmath4 mesons . the differential cross section with respect to the transverse momentum @xmath5 and the rapidity @xmath6 of",
    "the produced @xmath4 then reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the charm quark mass , @xmath9 gev is the @xmath3 meson mass and @xmath10 is the cross section for @xmath2 pair production with transverse momentum @xmath5 , rapidity @xmath6 and invariant mass @xmath11 .",
    "the nonperturbative constant @xmath12 is related to the probability for a @xmath2 pair with an invariant mass between @xmath13 and @xmath14 to transition to a @xmath4 . in this work",
    "we will focus on the nuclear modification factor for which the value of @xmath12 plays no role since it is assumed to be the same in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "since we work at forward rapidity , the projectile proton is probed at large @xmath1 and therefore the gluon density inside it can be described using collinear factorization . for this",
    "we use the mstw 2008  @xcite parametrization at leading order since the remaining of our calculation is done at this order . the target , on the other hand , is probed at very small @xmath1 and",
    "the information about its gluon density is encoded in the function @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a fundamental representation wilson line in the color field of the target .",
    "@xmath17 is obtained by solving numerically the running coupling balitsky - kovchegov equation  @xcite . in the case of a proton target",
    "we use the mv@xmath18 parametrization introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as the initial condition .",
    "it involves , similarly to the aamqs  @xcite one , several parameters which are fit to hera dis data  @xcite . in this case",
    "there is no explicit dependence on the impact parameter .    in the case of a nuclear target we use , again following  @xcite , the optical glauber model to relate the dipole amplitude of a nucleus to the one of a proton .",

    "this model has an explicit impact parameter dependence , which we will relate to the centrality classes used by the experiments in the following way .",
    "the experimental results are reported in centrality classes together with an estimate of the mean number of collisions in each class , @xmath26 .",
    "we take this estimate and translate it into a value of the impact parameter in the optical glauber model using the relation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the centrality dependent results presented in the following section are obtained with this fixed impact parameter in each centrality class . using instead distributions in the impact parameter space would be more consistent and could affect our results significantly depending on the exact shape of these distributions but this would require experimental access not only to @xmath31 but to the full @xmath32 distribution in each centrality class .",
    "the nuclear modification factor of forward @xmath4 production in proton - lead collisions at the lhc was recently measured by the alice collaboration in several centrality classes at @xmath33 tev  @xcite .",
    "as explained previously , to compare our results with these data we fix the impact parameter @xmath20 such that @xmath34 in each centrality class considered by alice .",
    "note that we do not consider the most peripheral class because this procedure would lead to an impact parameter value for which the saturation scale of the nucleus falls below the one of the proton . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpa_bins ] we show the results of our calculation compared with alice data for the nuclear modification factor @xmath35 , defined as @xmath36 as a function of @xmath37 for the five most central classes . the uncertainty band , which is quite narrow on this plot , contains the variation of the charm quark mass between 1.2 and 1.5 gev and of the factorization scale between @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 where @xmath11 is the @xmath2 pair s invariant mass .",
    "we observe that the description of the data is quite good for the three most central bins , but in the optical glauber model @xmath35 approaches unity too quickly with deacreasing @xmath32 .",
    "this is clearly visible for the fifth bin where @xmath35 is almost constant and very close to unity in our calculation while the data still shows a significant variation with @xmath37 .     as a function of @xmath37 in different centrality bins compared with alice data  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of @xmath37 in different centrality bins compared with alice data  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]     as a function of @xmath37 in different centrality bins compared with alice data  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of @xmath37 in different centrality bins compared with alice data  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]     as a function of @xmath37 in different centrality bins compared with alice data  @xcite . ]",
    "in this work we have investigated the centrality dependence of @xmath0 suppression in high energy proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "we have used the same framework as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown to lead to a nuclear modification factor in minimum bias collisions much closer to experimental data than previous calculations in the color glass condensate . however this model seems to predict a too strong centrality dependence compared with recent alice data  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that here we have estimated the suppression in each centrality class considered in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a fixed impact parameter corresponding to the average number of binary collisions estimated by alice . for a more consistent comparison",
