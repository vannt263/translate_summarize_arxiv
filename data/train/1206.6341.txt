    "the vulcan petawatt laser facility at rutherford appleton laboratory provides a beam using optical parametric chirped pulse amplification ( opcpa ) technology with a central wavelength of 1054  nm and a pulse full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) duration of 0.7  ps .",
    "the opcpa approach enables an amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) to peak - intensity contrast ratio exceeding @xmath43 several nanoseconds before the peak of the laser pulse .",
    "the laser pulse was focused with an @xmath44 off - axis parabola providing up to 160  j on the target .",
    "the maximum laser intensity of @xmath45 w / cm@xmath1 was achieved with a laser focus containing approximately 30% of the energy in an 8  @xmath16 m ( fwhm ) diameter spot .",
    "the p - polarized laser beam was incident on target at @xmath46 from the target surface normal    the spectra were measured using a fssr ( focusing spectrometer with spatial resolution ) equipped with spherically bent ( radius of curvature @xmath47  mm ) mica crystals .",
    "the fssr spectrometers were aligned to observe radiation in the wavelength range from @xmath48 to @xmath49   ( energy from @xmath50 to @xmath51  kev ) containing the k - shell spectra from multi - charged and neutral al ions .",
    "the spectra were acquired from the front , laser irradiated surface , at 45@xmath52 to the target normal as schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) . background fogging and crystal fluorescence due to intense fast electrons were reduced using a pair of 0.5  t permanent magnets that formed a slit 10  mm wide in front of the crystal .",
    "spectra were recorded on kodak industrex aa400 photographic x - ray film .",
    "preliminary time - dependent calculations using a simplified atomic model were performed to determine the bulk plasma conditions .",
    "we then performed detailed steady - state calculations at various plasma conditions to compute the emission spectrum as a function of electron temperature and density and radiation temperature , where we assumed that the radiation field seen by the plasma was a planckian distribution .",
    "our preliminary time - dependent calculations show that , at the high electron densities under consideration here the system reaches steady - state very quickly .",
    "our calculations include all relevant atomic processes , that is , photoionization , collisional ionization , autoionization , collisional and radiative excitation and de - excitation , and all recombination processes .",
    "the atomic structure and collisional cross section calculations were made using the los alamos suite of atomic physics codes@xmath53 .",
    "the resulting rate equations are solved to produce a set of ion populations that depends sensitively on the electron temperature and density , the radiation field , and the fraction of energetic electrons included in our model .",
    "opacity effects are included via escape factors .",
    "the resulting level populations are used to produce emission spectra , where the effects of detailed lines are included via a mixed - uta ( unresolved - transition - array ) approach . to correctly model the exotic plasma created experimentally ,",
    "it is necessary to include a very large number of configurations , representing al ions in which up to six electrons have been removed from the @xmath18 and @xmath29 shells and placed in excited states .",
    "such multiply excited states were found to be important in accurately reproducing the observed emission spectra . in particular , we find that the radiative decay from the @xmath29 to @xmath18 shell in any one specific configuration results in a relatively weak line , but that the very large number of configurations with different combinations of spectator electrons in excited states , in which this radiative transition occurs , allows the observed transition to become prominent .",

    "<S> * *    the properties of high energy density plasma are under increasing scrutiny in recent years due to their importance to our understanding of stellar interiors , the cores of giant planets@xmath0 , and the properties of hot plasma in inertial confinement fusion devices@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> when matter is heated by x - rays , electrons in the inner shells are ionized before the valence electrons . </S>",
    "<S> ionization from the inside out creates atoms or ions with empty internal electron shells , which are known as hollow atoms ( or ions)@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> recent advances in free - electron laser ( fel ) technology@xmath3 have made possible the creation of condensed matter consisting predominantly of hollow atoms . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that such exotic states of matter , which are very far from equilibrium , can also be formed by more conventional optical laser technology when the laser intensity approaches the radiation dominant regime@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> such photon - dominated systems are relevant to studies of photoionized plasmas found in active galactic nuclei and x - ray binaries@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our results promote laser - produced plasma as a unique ultra - bright x - ray source for future studies of matter in extreme conditions as well as for radiography of biological systems and for material science studies@xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> a high - intensity laser rapidly ionises valence electrons from a thin target through field ionisation@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons are accelerated in the strong electric field of the laser and can quickly reach very high , relativistic , energies . during the interaction of an intense laser pulse with a thin foil some of these hot electrons oscillate through the foil@xmath8 , due to reflection by the fields on each surface , known as refluxing . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons radiate x - rays via thomson scattering of the incident and scattered laser light and via bremsstrahlung through the strong plasma field at the foil surfaces ( see fig .  1 ) . in the case of non - linear thomson scattering an intensity and </S>",
    "<S> spectrum estimate is possible@xmath9 and for a laser intensity of approximately @xmath10 w / cm@xmath1 , this yields an x - ray intensity of around @xmath12 w / cm@xmath1 and in the kev range . </S>",
    "<S> this is well beyond the perturbative regime for laser - matter interactions . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the bremsstrahlung induced by the plasma electric field@xmath13 results in an x - ray radiation intensity of @xmath14 @xmath15 w / cm@xmath1 for similar laser intensity and a laser spot size of 10  @xmath16 m . </S>",
    "<S> we note that modern x - ray fels produce extremely bright monochromatic and coherent x - ray fluxes , in comparison this radiation field is polychromatic and up to two orders of magnitude more intense . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find that long - wavelength , super - intense laser radiation ( of order @xmath17 w / cm@xmath1 ) drives the ionized electrons from the target to very high energies , which thermalize via intense emission of x - ray photons . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting x - ray radiation field is so intense that hollow atoms dominate , resulting in the creation of exotic states of matter , as illustrated in the lower panel of fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> such radiation dominated exotic states are examples of atomic systems far from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first observation of such states driven by polychromatic radiation fields with intensities of order @xmath12 w / cm@xmath1 , which replicate the processes that may occur in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) where intense x - ray fields drives inner shell photoexcitation@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this process is demonstrated in this joint theoretical and experimental study .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were made at the vulcan petawatt laser facility at rutherford appleton laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> spectrally resolved x - ray emission between 7 and 8.4    from pure aluminium foils of 1.5 and 20 @xmath16 m thicknesses was investigated . </S>",
    "<S> al @xmath18-shell spectra measured at different laser and target parameters are shown in the lower panel of fig .  2 . </S>",

    "<S> the measured resonance line centers are shifted to longer wavelength with respect to the accepted values by 10 and 20 - 25 m   respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to ion acceleration and subsequent doppler shifts@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the black curve in the lower panel represents the data obtained from a 1.5 @xmath16 m thin al foil irradiated with 160  j on target , the maximum available . for this case the laser intensity at the central area of the focal spot of 8 @xmath16 m diameter reached the value of @xmath22 w / cm@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> intense hollow atom spectral lines are observed in the spectral range between the ly@xmath19 and he@xmath19 resonance lines , i.e. between 7.17 and 7.76  , and also on the short wavelength side ( blue edge ) of the k@xmath19 line just below 8.34  .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the reduction of the laser pulse energy from 160  j to 64  j ( and corresponding decrease in laser intensity at the target surface ) leads to remarkable changes in the spectra - a substantial decrease in the yield of hollow ion spectral lines occurs . for a measurement made using the full laser energy but a 20  @xmath16 m thick target ( blue curve ) , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a similar change in the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> for reference , the data obtained@xmath23 using a much lower laser energy of 80 mj ( laser intensity of @xmath24 w / cm@xmath1 ) is also presented in fig .  2 ( lowest curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a spectrum is typical for a low - z target heated by a moderate intensity high contrast laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> no hollow ion transitions are observed in such measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the large energy deposited in the present experiment leads to a quite different physical picture than that used for lower energy laser experiments </S>",
    "<S> . the intense vulcan laser rapidly ionizes valence electrons from the al target through field ionization@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons are accelerated in the strong electric and magnetic fields of the laser , and the ponderomotive electron energy@xmath25 in a laser field at an intensity of @xmath26 w / cm@xmath1 , is around 10  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the thin al target is essentially transparent to these highly - relativistic electrons@xmath7 , but the electrons quickly lose energy through bremsstrahlung@xmath27 ( and ( non - linear ) thomson scattering@xmath28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> bremsstrahlung emission@xmath27 at such relativistic electron energies results in a reasonably flat distribution of photons in the x - ray energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> these photons interact with the al ions and atoms in the target by interacting with electrons in the inner atomic shells and ejecting multiple @xmath18 and @xmath29-shell electrons . </S>",
    "<S> inner - shell electrons are preferentially ionized by high - energy photons so that the excess recoil momentum can be absorbed by the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig .  3 , where we show the ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath29 shell ionization probability as a function of the photon ( pink line ) and electron ( blue line ) energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that high - energy photons at 1  kev or higher are much more efficient at removing @xmath18 shell electrons than electrons of similar energies . a previous measurement@xmath30 , which used similar laser intensities to the present measurement but a much thicker target , found that electron pumping of hollow ions was the main ionizing mechanism . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the generation of hollow ions was not efficient .    </S>",
    "<S> after photoionization , the @xmath18-shell is rapidly filled by auger decay , resulting in the further emission of @xmath29-shell electrons . </S>",
    "<S> radiative decay ( where an @xmath29-shell electron drops back into the @xmath18-shell ) also accounts for a small fraction of the recombination , and results in observable emission lines usually referred to as satellites . </S>",
    "<S> we observe different emission spectra depending on the laser energy and spot size . </S>",
    "<S> for the lower laser energy case ( green line in figure  2 at 64  j ) , we observe little emission , with prominent peaks just below @xmath31 and @xmath32  . </S>",
    "<S> these lines correspond to the he@xmath19 and ly@xmath19 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> some satellites to these lines can also be observed . in the full laser energy case </S>",
    "<S> ( 160  j ; black line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) the spectra is dramatically different . </S>",
    "<S> the ` usual ' he@xmath19 and ly@xmath19 lines are dominated by significant emission between @xmath33 and @xmath34    and between @xmath35 and @xmath36  . the new emission at wavelengths lower than the he@xmath19 line is due to the radiative decay from the @xmath29-shell to the @xmath18-shell within ions which have a double @xmath18-shell vacancy , as well as several @xmath29-shell vacancies . a possible hollow atom configuration is shown schematically in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> emission arises from many ion stages of al , from al iii through al x. for emission to be observed from such ion stages at these high field intensities implies that the electron density remains high , so that three - body recombination drives the ions back towards the neutral stage . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the radiation field is interacting with near - solid density al , that is at electron densities greater than @xmath37 @xmath38 and ion densities @xmath39 @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the emission in the longer wavelength range ( @xmath35 to @xmath36  ) results from a similar radiative decay process , except that in this case the initial state has only one @xmath18-shell vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> this emission occurs at slightly later times , when the electron density is smaller and the radiation field has significantly decreased . </S>",
    "<S> such transitions are less energetic and so occur at longer wavelengths . refluxing of fast electrons , which are responsible for x - ray radiation , between the target s front and rear occurs only in thin foils and vanishes in thick ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is the primary reason for the different spectra observed from the 1.5 @xmath16 m and 20@xmath16 m foils .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurements are analyzed by performing sophisticated atomic kinetics calculations using the atomic code@xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper panel of fig .  2 shows calculations ( all using atomic ) , modeled by a plasma exposed to a radiation field peaked at 3 kev , with a bulk electron temperature of 55 ev and electron density of @xmath41 @xmath38 . a small fraction ( 5% ) of </S>",
    "<S> the electron distribution was in a hot - electron tail with a temperature of 5 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the full calculation is the lower pink line and we find clear evidence of emission from hollow ions from a range of al charge states . the comparison with the measured spectrum ( black / pink lines at the top of the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) shows that the kinetics calculation successfully reproduces almost all features of the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we find that transitions involving double @xmath18-shell holes ( between 7.2 and 7.7  ) are visible for a range of al ions from al iv ( neon - like ) through al ix ( boron - like ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the peak heights corresponding to the transitions associated with each ion stage are in fair agreement with the broad charge - state distribution of the ions at these conditions shown in the fig .  2 inset . </S>",
    "<S> emission lines have been identified that arise from ions with up to six electrons removed from the @xmath18 and @xmath29 shell - true hollow ions . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe significant emission at higher wavelengths ( 7.7 and 8.3  ) from single @xmath18-shell holes , again from a range of al ions as indicated . </S>",
    "<S> this emission is mostly from plasma at lower densities interacting with a much reduced radiation field .    to unambiguously demonstrate that the intense radiation field is responsible for the double @xmath18-shell hollow ion emission , we also show two calculated spectra ( grey and red lines ) in the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 , with no radiation field included in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> virtually no emission lines due to hollow ions are observed , particularly in the region between 7.2 and 7.7  . </S>",
    "<S> the red line shows the influence of the 5  kev hot - electron tail on the emission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the radiation field has a dramatic effect . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the blue line shows the effect of radiation on the calculation whilst omitting the hot - electron tail . we find that the hot electrons do excite hollow ions , but provide only a small part of the measured intensity of the hollow ion spectral lines ; fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 provides an explanation for this .    </S>",
    "<S> our study demonstrates that with high - powered laser technology signatures of the radiation dominant regime are apparent and polychromatic x - ray fields have extreme intensity which compliment the monochromatic and coherent fields delivered by xfels . </S>",
    "<S> we show that polychromatic x - ray fields drive states of matter far from equilibrium reproducing some of the conditions that may occur in agns . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the radiation dominant regime of matter ionization is demonstrated , that in turn allows us to observe radiation involving double @xmath18-shell hole states , true hollow atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we plan further studies of the properties of these exotic states of matter created in super - intense laser pulse experiments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results demonstrate how laser - plasma interaction physics will change as laser intensities move towards the radiation dominant regime , a region where classical electrodynamics begins to break down@xmath42 . </S>"
