    "it is a well - known fact that ultimately due to magnetic dipole interaction , different domains are formed in magnetic systems @xcite . in many situations , the physical region separating two different magnetic domains  the domain wall  must be treated as a physical entity because it has a characteristic behaviour when acted by external agents .",
    "for instance , it is known that the response of a magnetic system to a frequency dependent external magnetic field depends on whether domain walls are present @xcite .",
    "domain walls can also move throughout the system and this motion happens to be dissipative @xcite .    a particularly interesting kind of domain wall is commonly found in low dimensional ferromagnetic systems .",
    "these are the so - called bloch walls@xcite .",
    "it is known that these walls perform dissipative motion @xcite due to the presence of the elementary excitations which can be scattered by the wall as it moves and the momentum transferred to them reduces the speed of the wall .",
    "the primary aim of this work is to study the influence of finite temperatures in the mobility of these bloch walls . for this purpose",
    "we start by considering a microscopic model for a one dimensional ferromagnet containing hard and easy - axis anisotropies and subject to an external magnetic field .",
    "a semiclassical picture provides us with the localized solutions for the spin configurations which are the solitons corresponding to the walls .    making use of a recently developed method for the analysis of the dissipative dynamics of solitons @xcite , in which the `` collective coordinate method '' @xcite is used to transform the original hamiltonian into one of a particle coupled to an infinite set of modes ,",
    "we show that the bloch wall behaves like a brownian particle .",
    "the advantage of using this method is that we keep closer contact with the microscopic details of the system and the mobility is naturally calculated as a function of the temperature .",
    "the information from the microscopic scattering processes between the bloch wall and the residual modes can be obtained from the knowledge of the phase shifts of the associated spectral problem . in the case of reflectionless potentials ,",
    "as it happens for vanishing anisotropies or external field , the motion of the wall is undamped .",
    "if this is not the case , the reflection coefficient does not vanish and the mobility is finite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model .",
    "the dynamics of its static solution is investigated in sec .",
    "iii and there we also show how to obtain an effective hamiltonian for the bloch wall coupled to the residual magnetic excitations . in sec .",
    "iv the mobility of the bloch wall is studied in terms of the scattering phase shifts of the second variation problem .",
    "the case of large external fields is investigated in sec.v where the phase shifts and the damping constant are explicitly evaluated .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec . vi .",
    "in this work we consider a one dimensional magnetic system composed by an array of spins lying along the @xmath0-direction .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that there is an easy - plane anisotropy which tries to keep the spins on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane and , on top of this , an in - plane anisotropy tending to align them along the @xmath3-direction .",
    "this is a totally anisotropic model which is described by a xyz model of magnetic systems defined by the hamiltonian    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the @xmath7 component ( @xmath8 ) of the @xmath9 spin of the system , @xmath10 is the modulus of the magnetic moment on each site and @xmath11 is the external magnetic field .",
    "the ferromagnetic @xmath12 model is actually defined for @xmath13 and this is the starting point of our analysis . as we can see from ( @xmath14 ) , the ground state of this system is the configuration where all the spins are aligned in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "however , there is another possible configuration which is a local minimum of the energy functional and can not be obtained from the previous uniform configuration by any finite energy operation .",
    "let us imagine that we describe our spins classically by vectors    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the polar angles of the @xmath9 spin . in this representation",
    "the above - mentioned configuration consists of all @xmath16 s equal to @xmath18  and  @xmath17 s equal to zero or @xmath19 . however , there are other configurations in which @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 which are approximately ( only because @xmath16 s may slightly vary @xcite ) local minima of the energy functional of the system .",
    "so , @xmath24 winds around the @xmath0 direction starting at @xmath25 = @xmath26 and ending at @xmath27 = @xmath28 .",
    "the so - called @xmath19-bloch wall @xcite is one example of these configurations where @xmath17 varies from @xmath29 to @xmath19 without making a complete turn around the @xmath0 axis .",
    "later on we will see the specific form of this configuration when we consider the system in the continuum limit .",
    "it will then be shown that bloch walls are related to soliton - like solutions of the non - linear equations which control the spin dynamics in the semi - classical approximation .",
    "if we now turn the external field @xmath11 on what happens is that the degeneracy between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is broken .",
    "for @xmath32 it is clear from ( @xmath14 ) that @xmath30 has lower energy than @xmath33 which is now a metastable configuration of the system . in this circumstance",
    "the system still presents a local minimum of the energy functional .",
    "the only difference is that whereas @xmath34 is still approximately @xmath18 , @xmath17 starts and ends at zero as -@xmath35 .",
    "the 2@xmath19-bloch wall is now the configuration where @xmath36 winds only once around @xmath0 .    in any of the two cases mentioned above",
    ", there is no way we could spend a finite energy to transform the bloch wall into the uniform configuration",
    ". we would need to turn an infinite number of spins over an anisotropy energy barrier .",
    "we say that these two configurations are topologically distinct .",
    "another important point is that ( @xmath14 ) is translation invariant and this is reflected by the translation invariance of the bloch wall .",
    "this means that the region about which the spins wind up can be centered anywhere on the @xmath0 axis . in reality",
    "they can even move with constant speed along that direction .",
    "these structures can be obtained by mapping the original hamiltonian ( @xmath37 ) into a @xmath38 field theoretical model such as the @xmath39 , sine - gordon or any other appropriate model .",
    "this can be done by simply proceeding a bit further with the semi - classical description for the spins we have seen in ( [ semispin ] ) and writing the hamilton equations of motion for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . after having done that we take the continuum limit @xmath42 and @xmath43 and",
    "write    @xmath44    where @xmath45 . assuming that the variations of @xmath46 and @xmath7 from site to site of the spin chain are small and linearizing the equations of motion with respect to @xmath7 one obtains    @xmath47\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the lattice spacing . then , eliminating @xmath7 from these equations , we get an effective equation of motion for @xmath49 of the form    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    @xmath52    and    @xmath53    notice that if @xmath54 one has @xmath55 whereas if @xmath56 it turns out that @xmath57 .",
    "so , as we can derive the r.h.s . of ( [ mofi ] ) from a potential energy density @xmath58 given by    @xmath59",
    "we see that @xmath60 controls the potential energy barrier due to the presence of @xmath61 and @xmath62 controls the anisotropy energy barrier .    the static solutions ( @xmath63 ) of eq .",

    "this solution is topologically distinct from the previous one .",

    "is impossible to be evaluated for a potential energy density as in ( [ pot ] ) we must choose an approximation to do it .",
    "since we are already considering large spins @xmath71 , and consequently in the semi - classical limit , let us take this approximation as the appropriate one for our case .",
    "the semi - classical limit ( @xmath72 ) turns out to be very easily tractable within the functional integral formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is simply the stationary phase method applied to ( [ gt ] ) .",
    "moreover , since we are only interested in static solutions , the functional derivative of @xmath73 happens to be the equation of motion ( [ mofi ] ) when @xmath74 .",
    "its solutions can be either constant ( uniform magnetization ) or the solitons ( bloch walls ) we mentioned in ( [ fia10]-[figen ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in studying the magnetic system in the presence of walls it is obvious that we must pick up one of those localized solutions as the stationary `` point '' in the configuration space and the second functional derivative of ( [ pot ] ) should be evaluated at this configuration .",
    "when this is done we are left with an eigenvalue problem that reads    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is denoting the soliton - like solution about which we are expanding @xmath77 .",
    "now one can easily show that @xmath78 is a solution of ( [ sle ] ) with @xmath79 .",
    "the existence of this mode is related to the translation invariance of the lagrangian in ( [ action ] ) and this makes the functional integral in ( [ gt ] ) blow up in the semi - classical limit ( gaussian approximation ) .",
    "the way out of this problem is the so - called collective coordinate method which was developed by field - theorists in the seventies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it consists of keeping the expansion of the field configurations about @xmath80 as    @xmath81    but regarding the @xmath82-number @xmath83 as a position operator .",

    "it should also be stressed that eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) is not an exact result .",
    "it is only valid in the limit @xmath72 or , to be more precise , when @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the coupling constant that originally appears in @xmath96 .",
    "it must also be emphasized that we have neglected inelastic terms such as @xmath97 or @xmath98 because these are only important if the wall moves at high speed @xmath99 originating cherenkov - like radiation of the elementary excitations of the medium .",
    "this approximation also means that the number of excitations in the medium is conserved .",
    "at this point we are ready to start to study properties such as the mobility of the wall because we have been able to map that problem into the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) which on its turn has been recently used to study the mobility of polarons , heavy particles and solitons in general .",
    "we shall not discuss this specific problem in this paper and urge those interested in the details of this calculation to follow them in references @xcite .",
    "the result that can be obtained reads @xcite    @xmath100\\cos ( \\omega -\\omega ^{\\prime } ) t   \\label{g}\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 is the damping function ( the inverse of the mobility ) , @xmath102 is the bose function and    @xmath103    is the so - called scattering function .    in the long time",

    "these are genuine solitons and for these the mobility is infinite .",
    "one may realize this is what happens for the bloch walls ( [ fia10 ] ) and ( [ fia20 ] ) . in these cases ,",

    "then , re - expressing ( [ qp ] ) in terms of even and odd defined parity states , it is easy to prove that this potential belongs to the class of reflectionless because its phase shifts are given by @xmath120 that do not distinguish between odd and even parities .",

    "even phase shifts of ( [ potv ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , their analytical evaluation is very complicated for all finite values of @xmath124 and @xmath127 , and in what follows we study the situation of large fields .",
    "in this section we evaluate the scattering phase shifts in the situation of large external fields and provide an explicit expression for the damping constant .      in the case of large fields ( @xmath128 ) the shrdinger - like equation ( [ sle2 ] ) can be written as @xmath129 where the potential ( [ potv ] ) is now reduced to the sum of the reflectionless contribution and a perturbation coming from the presence of the large field , explicitly @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132    in order to obtain the even and odd scattering phase shifts @xmath133 corresponding to a particle in a one dimensional symmetric potential like ( [ vap ] ) , we will use of a 1d version of the fredholm theory @xcite , which states that @xmath134 where @xmath133 are the phase shifts originated by both contributions , the first coming from the reflectionless potential @xmath135 , and the other associated to the high field perturbation @xmath136 . on the other hand",

    "making use of ( [ ps0 ] ) and considering that @xmath125 is small enough , the expression for the the phase shifts ( [ piacot ] ) can be written up to first order in @xmath140 as @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143    using a convenient basis set , the three expressions given by ( [ yyy ] ) and ( [ rmi ] ) can be analytically evaluated ( see the apendix ) yielding @xmath144 ,    \\label{aeok2}\\ ] ] @xmath145 ,    \\label{aeok}\\ ] ] @xmath146 now we can finally write down an expression for the phase shifts @xmath147 by substituting ( [ aeok ] ) and ( [ beo ] ) in ( [ nova1 ] ) . in so doing one gets @xmath148 \\label{deltaeo}\\ ] ]    looking at ( 51 )",
    "we realize that , whereas @xmath149 remains almost unchanged as a function of @xmath150 for @xmath151 ( see fig.1 ) , @xmath152 presents a completely different structure . as it is shown in fig.2 , the odd phase shift for @xmath151 display a @xmath153 amplitude discontinuity characteristic of a resonance .",
    "this discontinuity becomes sharper as @xmath154 , giving no contribution to the reflection coefficient , because as expected from ( [ ps0 ] ) , the even and the odd phase shifts approach each other for small @xmath125 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "in this situation the @xmath153 amplitude discontinuity is still present , but as an isolated one , does not contribute to the reflection coefficient .",
    "we can now turn our atention to the behaviour of the phase shifts near @xmath155 . in order to do this",
    "we will use the 1d  version of the levinson s theorem @xcite for one - dimensional symmetric potentials .",
    "levinson s theorem establishes that : @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the number of even and odd parity bound states . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the even parity state phase shift is always @xmath159 for @xmath155 for any finite value of @xmath127 , then from ( [ levi ] ) it is clear that our system has an even parity bound state for any value of @xmath125 .",
    "the existence of this state is in complete agreement with the translational invariance of the system and corresponds to the goldstone mode .",
    "the analysis of the existence of an odd parity bound state is slightly different .",
    "as can be seen for ( [ ps0 ] ) the correct definition of @xmath160 according to ( [ levi ] ) is @xmath161 because there is no odd parity bound state for the @xmath162 case .",
    "following the same idea and realizing that ( [ deltaeo ] ) behaves in the same way as ( [ ps0 ] ) for small enough @xmath150 , we conclude that @xmath163 and therefore there is no odd bound state in the @xmath151 case .",
    "actually , @xmath164 for large values of k whereas they start to deviate from one another as k decreases . equation ( [ pinky ] ) represents an extreme situation when @xmath165 discontinously jumps from @xmath166 to @xmath167 when @xmath168 .",
    "this is the only way we can reconcile the absence of an odd bound state and the reflectiolessness of the potential .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of ( [ vap ] ) is composed by : i ) the @xmath169 solution ( [ fi0 g ] ) corresponding to the translation mode of the wall ( goldstone mode ) and ii ) the @xmath170 solutions which constitute the continuum modes and correspond to magnons .      in order to find the damping coefficient we must compute @xmath171 .",
    "this can be done by inserting ( [ deltaeo ] ) into the general expression @xmath172 although we have its analytical form in the present approximation , we had better plot it for the whole range of the momentum @xmath173 for various ratios of @xmath174 ( anisotropy / external field ) ( see fig .",
    "having done that , one can immediately integrate this function in expression ( [ damp ] ) which finally allows us to describe the damping as a function of the temperature as shown in fig.5 .",
    "as it can be seen , the damping constant is linear for the whole range of temperatures .",
    "this result can be obtained directly from ( [ damp ] ) . for @xmath175",
    "high enough the damping constant can be approximated by @xmath176 which is linear on @xmath175 , independently of the explicit form of @xmath107 . in the low temperature regime",
    "we can write @xmath177 where @xmath178 always presents a gap given by @xmath179\\hbar^2c^2/\\lambda^2 $ ] and therefore and exponentially small damping . however , this expression must be studied in the limit in which we are interested ; namely , @xmath154 . unlike @xmath105 given by ( [ g1 ] ) the expression ( [ aoc ] ) can not be analitically estimated in a trivial way because @xmath107 has only been computed numerically . here",
    "it must be stressed that this result is only reliable for not too low temperatures because we have employed the odd phase shift @xmath180 from fig.2 and its computation clearly do not account for its correct values for @xmath168 .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that for very low energies one can not approximate @xmath181 in ( [ aap ] ) by its first term although this approximation works well for the even phase shift @xmath182 .",
    "this turns out to be a good description of the mobility of the wall for extremely high fields if we keep the above explanation in mind .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the dissipative dynamics of bloch walls in a one dimensional anisotropic ferromagnet in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we have considered the limit of high magnetic fields although there is no reason why one should not apply the same methods to the low field case .",
    "the only difference is that the scattering problem with which one has to deal is more straightforward in the high field case .",
    "our predictions are that the damping coefficient @xmath105 presents a linear behaviour as is plotted in fig.5 , for a vast range of temperatures .",
