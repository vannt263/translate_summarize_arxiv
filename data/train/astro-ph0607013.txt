    "the nature of the first generation of stars , and their influence on later epochs of structure formation , is a fundamental issue in modern cosmology",
    ". a great deal of theoretical progress has been made ( see reviews by   & larson ( 2004 ) and   & ferrara ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "however , a major question remains : what is the initial mass function of the first stars ?",
    "the answer to this question will help explain the contributions that population iii stars made towards reionization and chemical enrichment of the universe , and will also determine if these stars form compact objects ( which may be the progenitors of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of most massive galaxies ) , and the properties of those objects .",
    "the nature of the population iii imf has been debated for over half a century  ( schwarzschild & spitzer 1953 ; ezer & cameron 1971 ; palla , salpeter , & stahler 1983 ; silk 1983 ; tegmark et  al .",
    "it has been generally agreed upon that the lack of efficient cooling mechanisms results in very massive stars , with an imf that is extremely top - heavy compared to the galactic imf .",
    "this has been supported by recent cosmological simulations of the formation of population iii stars , which argue for massive objects ( abel et  al .",
    "2002 ; bromm et  al .",
    "2002 ; bromm & loeb 2004 ; yoshida et  al .",
    "these simulations find that the jeans - unstable clumps which form in the cores of high - redshift halos are on the order of a thousand solar masses out of which a single primordial protostar condenses , and the subsonic contraction of the clump ( even at high densities ) greatly reduces the chance of fragmentation into many low - mass stars .",
    "though suggestive , these cosmological simulations lack the necessary physics and resolution to follow the collapse of the primordial cloud core to the point where accretion onto the star has been stopped and the star s final mass has been determined .",
    "the issue of accretion shutoff onto pop iii stars has been examined by & palla ( 2003 ) and & mckee ( 2004 ) .",
    "omukai & palla perform 1d , spherically symmetric simulations of the shutoff of accretion onto a primordial protostar .",
    "they find that there is a critical mass accretion rate , @xmath12  m@xmath7/year , below which stars can grow to essentially arbitrary masses ( certainly @xmath13  m@xmath7 ) , limited only by the mass of available gas and the stellar lifetime . above this critical accretion rate , the maximum mass of the star decreases as @xmath14 increases due to radiative feedback .",
    "they find that for a more realistic , time - varying accretion rate taken from   ( 2002 ) ( hereafter referred to as abn02 ) , the star can grow to masses of @xmath15  m@xmath7 .",
    "tan & mckee present a theoretical model of population iii star formation that combines models of the collapsing cloud core , evolution of the primordial protostar and accretion disk .",
    "they show that radiative feedback processes are extremely important once the protostar reaches a mass of @xmath16  m@xmath7 .",
    "their models use as the fiducial case an accretion rate onto the disk taken from the simulation of abn02 . as with the omukai & palla calculation , accretion rates onto the forming protostar are critical input parameters , if not the most critical parameter , for determining the final mass of the population iii star .",
    "how well have the accretion rates onto population iii protostars been constrained ?",
    "recent work has made it clear that these rates must be determined primarily from cosmological simulations .",
    "( 2002 ) do not have the mass and spatial resolution necessary to provide constraints .",
    "abn02 , in one of the most highly resolved simulations published to date , simulated the formation of a single population iii protostellar core that has a maximum accretion rate onto the forming protostar of @xmath9  m@xmath7/year . & loeb ( 2004 ) perform a high - resolution calculation of the formation of a primordial protostar and find an accretion rate rate that starts at @xmath17  m@xmath7/year , but declines rapidly . finally ,   ( 2006 ) present a calculation of the formation of a primordial protostellar cloud that takes into account opacity effects due to molecular hydrogen and also implements a novel particle - splitting scheme .",
    "this allows them to accurately follow the evolution of a primordial gas cloud which collapses to a density of @xmath18  @xmath19 . as in abn02 , yoshida et al .",
    "do not observe fragmentation of the collapsing cloud core , and observe gas accretion rates that peak at @xmath20  m@xmath7/yr and average around @xmath21  m@xmath7/yr .",
    "all of the published work thus far which studies population iii star formation in a cosmological context and at extremely high resolution has been an examination of a single object , and as such can not answer fundamental questions , such as : what is the variance in accretion rates onto primordial protostars ? is there some systematic dependence upon redshift or environment ? and , finally , is the lack of fragmentation in the collapsing halo core universal ?",
    "some previous work has studied large numbers of primordial halos  ( machacek , bryan , & abel 2001 , 2003 ; yoshida et  al .",
    "however , these studies lacked the resolution to study properties of the halo cores in detail .    in this work",
    "we will attempt to address these questions by performing a series of extremely high dynamical range adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations of the formation of a population iii protostar in a @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "our mass and spatial resolution is comparable to abn02 and   ( 2006 ) .",
    "this is the first time that a significant number of such high - resolution calculations have been sampled , allowing us to investigate the robustness of previous results and address questions that they were unable to examine .",
    "our sample includes halos which cool and exhibit runaway collapse at their centers over the redshift range @xmath22 .",
    "the halo virial masses at collapse range from @xmath23  m@xmath7 and show no systematic trend with redshift .",
    "we explore the environmental effects that lead to these variations .",
    "we discover that there is a trend towards increasing accretion rates in halos with decreasing collapse redshifts ( later collapse times ) , which is caused by evolving halo virial properties and the physics of molecular hydrogen formation .",
    "peak accretion rates vary between @xmath24 and @xmath25  m@xmath7/year and have similar time dependence .",
    "finally , we observe that our collapsing protostellar cloud cores do not fragment , consistent with previous results , which suggests that population iii stars which form in halos of mass @xmath11  m@xmath7 always form in isolation .",
    "the simulations discussed in this paper study population iii protostars which form in halos of mass @xmath26  m@xmath7 and in the redshift range @xmath27 .",
    "these halos are far more common than the extremely rare peaks discussed by   ( 2005 ) and   ( 2005 ) , and thus represent a more `` typical '' population of primordial stars .",
    "additionally , in this paper we do not concern ourselves with halos with virial temperatures above @xmath28 k , where cooling by atomic hydrogen could be important  ( oh & haiman 2002 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ) . investigation of this mode of population iii star formation , though potentially very important , is deferred to a later paper .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers presenting results of high dynamical range amr cosmological simulations of the formation of population iii stars in a @xmath0cdm cosmological context .",
    "as stated previously , this paper discusses issues relating to accretion rates onto evolving primordial protostellar cores .",
    "the second paper in this series ( oshea , norman & li 2006 , in preparation ) presents an investigation of the evolution of angular momentum in a collapsing primordial halo core .",
    "the third paper in this series ( oshea & norman 2006 , in preparation ) presents an examination of the formation of population iii protostellar halos in the presence of a molecular hydrogen photodissociating uv background .",
    "later papers will present more detailed investigations of the evolution of the collapsing protostellar cores and the formation of a primordial protostar embedded in a thick accretion disk .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section  [ methodology ] , we provide a summary of enzo , the code used to perform the calculations in this paper and the second and third papers in this series , and of the calculation setup .",
    "sections  [ repstar ] and  [ compare - real ] summarize our results : in section  [ repstar ] , we present the detailed evolution of a single , representative population iii protostellar cloud , and compare it to previous work . in section  [ compare - real ] , we present results of a series of calculations of population iii protostellar cloud formation with varied large scale structure and simulation volumes , and show some systematic trends in the properties of these clouds . in section  [ discuss ]",
    "we discuss the results presented in this work , and in section  [ summary ] we present a summary of the main results and conclusions .",
    "` enzo ' is a publicly available , extensively tested adaptive mesh refinement cosmology code developed by greg bryan and others ( bryan & norman 1997a , 1997b ; norman & bryan 1999 ; oshea et  al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the specifics of the enzo code are described in detail in these papers ( and references therein ) , but we present a brief description here for clarity .    the enzo code couples an n - body particle - mesh ( pm ) solver ( efstathiou et  al .",
    "1985 ; hockney & eastwood 1988 ) used to follow the evolution of a collisionless dark matter component with an eulerian amr method for ideal gas dynamics by & colella ( 1989 ) , which allows high dynamic range in gravitational physics and hydrodynamics in an expanding universe . this amr method ( referred to as _ structured _ amr )",
    "utilizes an adaptive hierarchy of grid patches at varying levels of resolution .",
    "each rectangular grid patch ( referred to as a `` grid '' ) covers some region of space in its _ parent grid _ which requires higher resolution , and can itself become the parent grid to an even more highly resolved _",
    "child grid_. enzo s implementation of structure amr places no fundamental restrictions on the number of grids at a given level of refinement , or on the number of levels of refinement .",
    "however , owing to limited computational resources it is practical to institute a maximum level of refinement , @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , the enzo amr implementation allows arbitrary integer ratios of parent and child grid resolution , though in general for cosmological simulations ( including the work described in this paper ) a refinement ratio of 2 is used .",
    "since the addition of more highly refined grids is adaptive , the conditions for refinement must be specified . in enzo",
    ", the criteria for refinement can be set by the user to be a combination of any or all of the following : baryon or dark matter overdensity threshold , minimum resolution of the local jeans length , local density gradients , local pressure gradients , local energy gradients , shocks , and cooling time . a cell reaching any or all of the user - specified criteria",
    "will then be flagged for refinement .",
    "once all cells of a given level have been flagged , rectangular solid boundaries are determined which minimally encompass them .",
    "a refined grid patch is then introduced within each such bounding volume , and the results are interpolated to a higher level of resolution .    in enzo , resolution of the equations being solved is adaptive in time as well as in space .",
    "the timestep in enzo is satisfied on a level - by - level basis by finding the largest timestep such that the courant condition ( and an analogous condition for the dark matter particles ) is satisfied by every cell on that level .",
    "all cells on a given level are advanced using the same timestep .",
    "once a level @xmath30 has been advanced in time @xmath31 , all grids at level @xmath32 are advanced , using the same criteria for timestep calculations described above , until they reach the same physical time as the grids at level @xmath30 . at this point grids at level @xmath32 exchange baryon flux information with their parent grids ,",
    "providing a more accurate solution on level @xmath30 .",
    "cells at level @xmath32 are then examined to see if they should be refined or de - refined , and the entire grid hierarchy is rebuilt at that level ( including all more highly refined levels ) .",
    "the timestepping and hierarchy rebuilding process is repeated recursively on every level to the maximum existing grid level in the simulation .",
    "two different hydrodynamic methods are implemented in enzo : the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) ( woodward & colella 1984 ) , which was extended to cosmology by ( 1995 ) , and the hydrodynamic method used in the zeus magnetohydrodynamics code ( stone & norman 1992a , 1992b ) .",
    "we direct the interested reader to the papers describing both of these methods for more information , and note that ppm is the preferred choice of hydro method since it is higher - order - accurate and is based on a technique that does not require artificial viscosity , which smoothes shocks and can smear out features in the hydrodynamic flow .    the chemical and cooling properties of primordial ( metal - free ) gas are followed using the method of ( 1997 ) and ( 1997 ) , supplemented with reactions for the 3-body formation of @xmath33 documented in abn02 .",
    "this method follows the non - equilibrium evolution of a gas of primordial composition with 9 total species : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath33 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the code also calculates radiative heating and cooling following atomic line excitation , recombination , collisional excitation , free - free transitions , molecular line excitations , and compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background , as well as any of approximately a dozen different models for a metagalactic uv background that heat the gas via photoionization and photodissociation .",
    "we model the cooling processes detailed in   ( 1997 ) , but with the molecular hydrogen cooling function of   & palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "the multispecies rate equations are solved out of equilibrium to properly model situations where , e.g. , the cooling time of the gas is much shorter than the hydrogen recombination time .",
    "a total of 9 kinetic equations are solved , including 29 kinetic and radiative processes , for the 9 species mentioned above .",
    "the chemical reaction equation network is technically challenging to solve due to the huge range of reaction time scales involved ",
    "the characteristic creation and destruction time scales of the various species and reactions can differ by many orders of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "the set of rate equations is extremely stiff , and an explicit scheme for integration of the rate equations can be costly if small enough timestep are taken to keep the network stable .",
    "this makes an implicit scheme preferable for such a set of equations , and enzo solves the rate equations using a method based on a backwards differencing formula ( bdf ) in order to provide a stable and accurate solution .",
    "it is important to note the regime in which this chemistry model is valid .",
    "according to ( 1997 ) and ( 1997 ) , the reaction network is valid for temperatures between @xmath42 k. the original model discussed in these two references is only valid up to n@xmath43  @xmath19 .",
    "however , addition of the 3-body h@xmath44 formation process allows correct modeling of the chemistry of the gas up until the point where collisionally - induced emission from molecular hydrogen becomes an important cooling process , which occurs at n@xmath45  @xmath19 . we do not include heating by molecular hydrogen formation , which should take place at densities above @xmath46  @xmath47 , and may affect temperature evolution at these high densities",
    "a further concern is that the optically thin approximation for radiative cooling breaks down , which begins at n@xmath48  @xmath19 . beyond this point ,",
    "modifications to the cooling function that take into account the non - negligible opacity of the gas to line radiation from molecular hydrogen must be made , as discussed by & abel ( 2004 ) .",
    "even with these modifications , a more correct description of the cooling of gas of primordial composition at high densities will require some form of radiation transport , which will greatly increase the cost of the simulations .",
    "the simulations discussed in this paper are set up as follows .",
    "we initialize all calculations at @xmath49 assuming a `` concordance '' cosmological model : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) , @xmath55 , and using an & hu ( 1999 ) power spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath56 .",
    "twelve simulations are generated using a separate random seed for each , meaning that the large - scale structure that forms in each of the simulation volumes is statistically independent of the others .",
    "these simulations , detailed in table  [ table.siminfo ] , are divided into sets of four simulations in three different box sizes : @xmath57 , and  @xmath58  h@xmath59  mpc ( comoving ) . the most massive halo to form in each simulation at @xmath60 ( typically with a mass of @xmath61  m@xmath7 )",
    "is found using a dark matter - only calculation with @xmath62 particles on a @xmath62 root grid with a maximum of 4 levels of adaptive mesh , refining on a dark matter overdensity criterion of @xmath63 .",
    "the initial conditions are then regenerated with both dark matter and baryons for each of the simulation volumes such that the lagrangian volume in which the halo formed is now resolved at much higher spatial and mass resolution .",
    "these simulations have a @xmath62 root grid and three levels of static nested grids , each with twice the spatial resolution and eight times the mass resolution of the previous grid .",
    "this gives an overall effective grid size of @xmath64 in the region where the most massive halo will form .",
    "the highest resolution grid in each simulation is @xmath65 grid cells , and corresponds to a volume @xmath66 )  h@xmath59 comoving kpc on a side for the ( 0.3 , 0.45 , 0.6 )  h@xmath59 mpc box .",
    "the dark matter particles in the highest resolution grid are ( 1.81 , 6.13 , 14.5 )  h@xmath59  m@xmath7 and the spatial resolution of cells on these grids are ( 293 , 439 , 586 )  h@xmath59 parsecs ( comoving ) . though the simulations have a range of initial spatial resolutions and dark matter masses , we find that the final simulation results are converged  the spatial and mass resolution of the 0.3  h@xmath59 mpc volume simulations can be degraded to that of the 0.6  h@xmath59 mpc without significantly changing the results .    the simulations with nested grid initial conditions are then started at @xmath49 and allowed to evolve until the collapse of the gas within the center of the most massive halo , which occurs at a range of redshifts ( as shown in section  [ compare - real ] , and summarized in tables  [ table.meaninfo-1 ] and  [ table.meaninfo-2 ] ) .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics are solved using the ppm method with a dual energy formulation ( the results are essentially identical when the zeus hydrodynamic method is used ) . the nonequilibrium chemical evolution and optically thin radiative cooling of the primordial gas",
    "is modeled as described in section  [ enzocode ] , following 9 separate species including molecular hydrogen ( but excluding deuterium ) .",
    "adaptive mesh refinement is enabled within the high resolution region such that cells are refined by factors of two along each axis , to a maximum of 22 total levels of refinement .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum resolution of ( 115 , 173 , 230 )  h@xmath59 astronomical units ( comoving ) at the finest level of resolution , with an overall spatial dynamical range of @xmath67 . to avoid effects due to the finite size of the dark matter particles ,",
    "the dark matter density is smoothed on a comoving scale of @xmath68  pc ( a proper scale of @xmath69 pc at @xmath70 ) .",
    "this is reasonable because at that radius in all of our calculations the gravitational potential is completely dominated by the baryons .",
    "grid cells are adaptively refined based upon several criteria : baryon and dark matter overdensities in cells of 4.0 and 8.0 , respectively , checks to ensure that the pressure jump and/or energy ratios between adjoining cells never exceeds 5.0 , that the cooling time in a given cell is always longer than the sound crossing time of that cell , and that the jeans length is always resolved by at least 16 cells .",
    "this guarantees that the truelove criterion  ( truelove et  al .",
    "1997 ) , which is an empirical result showing that in order to avoid artificial gravitational fragmentation in numerical simulations the jeans length must be resolved by at least 4 grid cells , is always maintained by a significant margin .",
    "simulations which force the jeans length to be resolved by a minimum of 4 and 64 cells produce results which are essentially identical to those presented here .",

    "selection of the most massive halo in each calculation may result in a bias towards unusual halo formation environments and may skew our results .",

    "this issue could possibly be clarified by performing an ensemble of simulations using halos chosen in a different manner .",
    "after the onset of collapse , the evolution of the core of the halo , which has a mass of one thousand solar masses , becomes effectively decoupled from the halo envelope since the time scales become much shorter within the halo core .",
    "this tells us that while the formation of the initial primordial protostellar cloud is strongly coupled to the time scales associated with cosmological structure formation , once the cloud has collapsed we can treat the core of the halo separately from the rest of the calculation .",

    "the reason for this bears examination . as shown by ( 1977 ) , as long as the densities in a condensing molecular cloud core span several orders of magnitude before a stage of dynamic instability is reached , the subsequent collapse properties of the cloud should resemble those of an isothermal sphere .",
    "the lack of characteristic time and length scales results in a self - similar wave of infalling gas which propagates outward at the speed of sound , resulting in an accretion rate that scales as the cube of the sound speed .",
    "this accretion rate can be derived in a more intuitive way by considering the properties of a cloud of gas with radius r and mass @xmath246 which is marginally unstable .",
    "the accretion rate of this gas must be given ( as an order of magnitude estimate ) by @xmath247 , where @xmath248 , where a is the characteristic velocity associated with the cloud ( the virial velocity ) . if this cloud was originally marginally supported against its self - gravity , then @xmath249 ( where g is the gravitational constant ) , which can be substituted into the expression for @xmath14 to give @xmath250 , independent of r. in the case of this quasi - statically collapsing cloud , the virial speed is comparable to the sound speed @xmath160 , giving @xmath251 . while the shu model assumes that the entire cloud is of a constant temperature , our calculations have a varying temperature as a function of radius , and a radially - varying accretion rate based on this temperature is an excellent fit .",
    "this is reasonable because the isothermal collapse model assumes that the infall wave propagates at the local sound speed , assuming that the cloud is not supported by any other means . in this calculation",
    "we completely neglect the effects of magnetic fields , and it can be seen from figure  [ fig.rep.panel3 ] that rotation contributes an insignificant amount of support to our representative protostellar cloud ( as well as in the other 11 simulations discussed in this paper ) , resulting in gas pressure being the sole means of support of the cloud .",
    "one slight difference between the shu model and our calculations is the presence of the dark matter halo , which results in a slightly steeper density profile ( @xmath252 ) , though the accretion rate result , being a function of sound speed , is not changed significantly .",
    "the observation that the rate of accretion onto the primordial protostar varies systematically as a function of redshift , with halos that collapse at higher redshift having an overall lower accretion rate , has significant implications for both reionization and metal enrichment of the early universe .",
    "there is no trend in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig.accrete.panel2 ] that suggests an accretion rate `` floor '' exists at high redshifts .",
    "however , one can make an estimate of the minimum possible accretion rate by observing that molecular hydrogen is only effective at cooling the primordial gas down to approximately 200 kelvin , which gives us an accretion rate using the shu model of @xmath253  m@xmath7/year , which is reasonably close to the accretion rates observed in the highest - redshift halos which have collapsed .",
    "though this implies convergence , it would be prudent to perform another suite of calculations at an even larger box size to be sure .",

    "& palla ( 2003 ) perform 1d , spherically - symmetric calculations of the evolution of a population iii protostar undergoing rapid accretion .",
    "they include radiative feedback effects , and find that there is a critical mass accretion rate , @xmath12  m@xmath7/year , below which objects can accrete to masses much greater than 100  m@xmath7 ( essentially up to the limit of gas available in the halo core and the main sequence lifetime of the forming object ) , and below which the maximum mass decreases as the accretion rate increases .",
    "they find that if they assume a time - varying accretion rate that stars at high values and decreases rapidly with time , the evolution of the star follows the @xmath264 path , and accretion can continue until the end of the star s main sequence lifetime .",
    "as can be seen from this discussion , it seems that the arguments for mass range given by abn02 are overly simplistic .",
    "however , the models discussed above do not completely resolve the issue of population iii imf  tan & mckee use a single accretion rate for their work ( which includes multi - dimensional effects ) , and omukai & palla perform spherically - symmetric calculations which may miss essential accretion shutoff physics .",
    "clearly , the relationship between accretion rates and final stellar mass can not be stated with any certainty , and will have to be addressed using multi - dimensional numerical simulations which include protostellar evolution and radiative feedback .",
    "however , if one assumes that the main - sequence lifetime of an accreting object is a reasonable proxy for the maximum stellar mass , it seems that population iii stars that form at higher redshifts should generally have smaller main - sequence masses .",
    "if in fact a lower overall accretion rate results in a less massive population of stars , these objects will be much less effective at ionizing the intergalactic medium ( since they produce overall fewer uv photons per baryon ) and will produce a completely different nucleosynthetic signature .",
    "this may be in accord with the wmap year iii measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background , which suggests that the universe was significantly reionized by @xmath265  ( page et  al .",
    "models show that the observed level of polarization does not require a large contribution to reionization from population iii stars",
    ". additionally , ( 2006 ) uses a semianalytical model constrained by the metallicity distributions of population ii stars in the galactic halo , relative abundances of ultra metal poor halo stars , and estimates of the ionizing photon budget required to reionize the igm , and suggests that population iii stars have an imf which has a mean mass of @xmath266  m@xmath7 .",
    "one factor that has been completely ignored in this work is the effect of a soft uv background .",
    "massive primordial stars are copious emitters of light in the lyman - werner band ( @xmath267 ev ) .",
    "atomic hydrogen is transparent to these photons , which photodissociate molecular hydrogen .",
    "this effect , explored by ( 2001 ) and others , increases the threshold mass of halos which form pop iii stars and may also result in an increase in temperatures in the halo cores , causing an increase in the overall accretion rate onto the forming protostars .",
    "we explore this issue in detail in a forthcoming paper ( oshea & norman 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "a semianalytical examination of this effect was made by & abel ( 2005 ) , who use press - schechter models of population iii star formation to predict a slowly rising lyman - werner background which provides some support to this idea .",
    "this suggests that further calculations including larger simulation volumes as well as a soft uv background will be necessary to make a definitive statement about the most common accretion rates .",
    "additionally , these calculations completely neglect the mode of primordial star formation that takes place in halos whose virial temperatures are above @xmath28 k. cooling in these systems is dominated by atomic hydrogen line emission and , particularly in the presence of a strong soft uv background , may result in a much larger amount of cold gas distributed in a different manner than in the systems simulated in this work , which have mean virial masses of a few times @xmath268  m@xmath7 and virial temperatures of around 1000 k. these systems have been examined numerically by & loeb ( 2003 ) , but further work is necessary to explore the properties of these objects .",
    "figure  [ fig.rep.panel3 ] in section  [ repstar ] shows clear signs of angular momentum evolution in the collapsing protostellar core .",
    "angular momentum is less of an issue in population iii star formation than in galactic star formation - the collapsing cosmological halo out of which the protostellar core forms has very little angular momentum from the outset ( with a spin parameter of @xmath269 ) , and violent relaxation during virialization results in an angular momentum distribution @xmath270 , so circular velocities are fairly constant throughout the halo .",
    "the @xmath142  m@xmath7 halo core out of which the protostar forms is not rotationally supported  the gas is essentially completely held up by thermal pressure , and the small amount of angular momentum that is actually transported is not a critical factor in the cloud core s collapse .",
    "this angular momentum redistribution , as discussed in section  [ repstar ] , appears to be due to a combination of angular momentum segregation and turbulent transport .",
    "similar results were reported by   ( 2006 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of angular momentum transport issues will be discussed in the second paper in this series ( oshea , norman & li 2006 , in preparation ) .    though the collapsing protostellar cloud is not rotationally supported by the time the central density reaches @xmath271  @xmath19 , it is inevitable that at some point a protostar with a rotationally - supported accretion disk will form , as discussed in   & mckee ( 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this takes place at high densities , where the optically - thin assumption used in the enzo cooling algorithms breaks down , which necessitates either an extension of the cooling model  ( ripamonti & abel 2004 ) or the use of a radiation hydrodynamics code such as zeus - mp  ( hayes et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "this issue will be approached in later work .",
    "the primordial chemistry model used in these calculations ignores the effects of deuterium , lithium , and the various molecules they form between these elements and ordinary hydrogen .",
    "deuterium and lithium have been shown to be unimportant in the temperature and density regimes that we have examined in this work  ( galli & palla 1998 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that they may be relevant in other situations of importance to population iii star formation  in particular , regions which have been ionized to very high electron fractions may experience significant cooling from the hd molecule , which has a low excitation energy and forms preferentially compared to @xmath33 due to chemical fractionation .",
    "this is particular true at low temperatures ( @xmath272  k ) where essentially all deuterium is converted to hd .",
    "cooling due to the hd molecule has the potential to cool gas down to approximately the temperature of the cosmic microwave background , which scales with redshift as @xmath273  k  ( flower et  al .",
    "2000 ; galli & palla 2002 ; lipovka , nez - lpez , & avila - reese 2005 ) .",
    "this gives a minimum baryon temperature of approximately @xmath274 kelvin at @xmath10 and could further reduce the minimum accretion rate onto a primordial protostar .",
    "lithium , while in principle an effective coolant when in lih , is safely ignored , since only a tiny fraction of lithium is converted into molecular form  ( mizusawa et  al . 2005 ) . a final chemical process which is omitted from our calculation is heating caused by molecular hydrogen formation at high densities ( @xmath275  @xmath19 ) , the inclusion of which which may result in differences in the temperature evolution of the gas in the highest density regimes considered here .",
    "this does not affect the main conclusions of our paper , as significant differences between halos can be observed at densities much lower than @xmath276 .",
    "the effects of magnetic fields are completely ignored in the simulations discussed in this work .",
    "we can justify this by examining the magnetic field necessary to delay the collapse of the halo core .",
    "if one assumes that the halo core can be represented reasonably well by an isothermal sphere of constant density ( which is reasonable at the onset of halo collapse ) , we can use the virial theorem to estimate the strength of the magnetic field which is necessary to support the collapse of the halo against gravity . assuming flux freezing and a uniform magnetic field , a magnetically critical isothermal sphere has a mass - to - flux ratio of    @xmath277    where m@xmath278 is the mass of the halo , @xmath279 is the magnetic flux in the cloud ( with r@xmath278 and b@xmath278 being the cloud radius and magnetic field strength , respectively ) , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "reasonable values for m@xmath278 and r@xmath278 are @xmath280  m@xmath7 and 4 parsecs , respectively , which gives us a value of the magnetic field of b@xmath281 g. the mean density of the cloud is n@xmath282  @xmath19 and the mean density of the universe at @xmath283 ( the redshift that our cloud collapses ) is @xmath146  @xmath19 , so if we assume a spherical collapse from the mean cosmic density assuming flux freezing , we see that the ratio of the magnetic field in the cloud to the mean universal magnetic field is    @xmath284    this gives us a mean magnetic field of @xmath285  g at @xmath286 .",
    "since there are no known objects that may produce magnetic fields between recombination ( @xmath287 ) and the epoch of pop iii star formation , and the strength of the magnetic field scales with the expansion of the universe as @xmath288 , we estimate that in order for magnetic fields to be dynamically important in the formation of population iii stars the magnetic field strength at recombination must be @xmath289 g. the current observational upper limit to magnetic field strength at recombination ( albeit at large scales ) is b @xmath290 3 x 10@xmath291 g as measured at the present epoch  ( jedamzik , katalini , & olinto 2000 ) , which corresponds to a magnetic field at recombination of approximately @xmath292 g. this is three orders of magnitude higher than needed to be dynamically relevant for population iii star formation ! the only known mechanism that could generate coherent magnetic fields with strengths of this scale is a discontinuous qcd or electroweak phase transition . however , the mechanisms involved are highly speculative and predictions of the possible magnetic field strengths are unreliable  ( sigl , olinto , & jedamzik 1997 ) . currently , the most plausible mechanisms for creating magnetic fields at recombination suggest that field strengths are on the order of @xmath293 g at recombination  ( matarrese et  al .",
    "2005 ) . given the observational uncertainty , it seems reasonable to ignore this effect , though future simulations will certainly include magnetic fields with a variety of field strengths and physical scales ..    assuming that the magnetic field at that epoch was strong enough to be dynamically important , we can calculate the effect that this has on the collapse of the star . due to the relatively high electron fraction in the halo core ( @xmath294 at @xmath295 pc ;",
    "see figure  [ fig.rep.panel2 ] ( b ) ) the assumption of flux freezing in the magnetic field at scales of @xmath143 pc is valid  ( maki & susa 2004 ) .",
    "however , the electron fraction rapidly declines at smaller radii , reaching @xmath296 at @xmath156 au , and this assumption may no longer be relevant .",
    "magnetic fields couple to charged particles ( electrons and ions ) , and these charged particles interact with the neutral medium . at high levels of ionization ,",
    "collisions between charged and neutral particles are frequent , implying that the magnetic field is strongly coupled to the gas .",
    "however , at low levels of ionization there are few charged particles , and the coupling with the neutral gas is weak . in an object that is subject to a gravitational acceleration this produces a relative drift of charged and neutral particles which allows the neutral gas to decouple from the magnetic field .",
    "this effect is known as `` ambipolar diffusion , '' and is believed to be an extremely important process in galactic star formation  ( mouschovias & morton 1991 ) .",
    "the retardation effect that ambipolar diffusion may have on the collapse of the halo core can be estimated by examining the relative timescales of ambipolar diffusion and halo collapse .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion timescale can be estimated as    @xmath297    where l and @xmath298 are a characteristic length scale and the neutral - ion relative drift velocity , respectively , and @xmath299 is the overall ionization fraction .",
    "a proxy for the halo collapse time scale is the free fall time , which for a spherical system is    @xmath300    where n is the particle number density in particles per cubic centimeter and",
    "g is the gravitational constant .",
    "the relevance of ambipolar diffusion can be estimated by taking the ratio of these two quantities , which is known as the `` collapse retardation time , '' @xmath301 .",
    "substituting in equations  [ eqn - ambipolar ] and  [ eqn - dyntime ] , we see that    @xmath302    examination of figures  [ fig.rep.panel1 ] and  [ fig.rep.panel2 ] show that at the final timestep in the calculation , the number density can be fitted by a power law and is roughly @xmath303  @xmath19 while the ionization fraction scales roughly as @xmath304 .",
    "plugging these into equation  [ eqn - collretard ] shows that @xmath305 is constant with radius .",
    "this is only a crude approximation , since the free fall time really should depend on the mean number density instead of the number density at a given radius .",
    "considering the rapid falloff of density , n(r ) is a reasonable approximation of n  strictly speaking , for a cloud with a density profile that scales as @xmath224 over many orders of magnitude in radius , the mean density is equal to @xmath306 , so our estimate of the free fall time is too high by a factor of @xmath307 . plugging this in to the equation , we get that @xmath308 everywhere , which indicates significant delay in collapse with respect to the free fall time .",
    "however , the relevant time scale in this case is more appropriately the quasistatic collapse time , which is approximated as @xmath309 .",
    "figure  [ fig.rep.panel3 ] shows that the mean radial velocity at the scales of interest ( @xmath310 parsecs ) is roughly 0.5 km / s .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath311 and scales linearly with the radius .",
    "comparison with the ambipolar diffusion time scale shows that @xmath312 and @xmath313 are within a factor of two of each other , which suggests that the presence of a magnetic field would not significantly impede the collapse of the halo core for the quasistatic collapse case .",
    "it is interesting to note that   & pineau des forts ( 2003 ) reach a similar conclusion using a significantly different method .",
    "there are several effects which we have neglected in these calculations which may affect our results .",
    "the box sizes of the calculations presented in this paper are relatively small ( 300  600 kpc / h comoving ) . & loeb ( 2004 ) show that finite box sizes can have significant effects on statistical properties of halo formation , resulting in an overall bias towards under - sampling of the mass function and late halo formation times .",
    "however , our calculations are not intended to provide a statistically accurate sampling of the mass function of dark matter halos .",
    "rather , the intent is to gain an understanding of the first halo to undergo baryonic core collapse in a simulation volume .",
    "an obvious extension of this work would be to simulate a much larger simulation volume so that cosmic variance and possible environmental effects are considered ( as discussed by barkana & loeb ) , and then simulate multiple halos within this volume .",
    "an example of this technique is presented by   ( 2005 ) , who simulate the formation of the first star - forming halo in a simulation volume which is @xmath314  h@xmath59 mpc on a side .",
    "they find that the first halo of mass @xmath315  h@xmath59  m@xmath7 forms by @xmath316 , and would be able to collapse by @xmath317 , when the halo has reached a mass of @xmath318  h@xmath59  m@xmath7 , which agrees reasonably well with estimates for a minimum halo mass to collapse and form a population iii star , as determined in this work .",
    "the virial temperature of this halo would be a factor of 2.4 higher than that of a halo which virializes at @xmath10 , and the @xmath33 production rate would be approximately 2.2 times higher . compared to a halo that forms at @xmath319  the highest redshift halo we examine  the differences in virial temperature and @xmath33 formation rate are 1.45 and 1.39 , respectively . though somewhat simplistic , these arguments suggest that the range of halo properties explored in our set of simulations may encompass most of the expected range of behavior . though the reed et al .",
    "simulations do not include baryonic physics , such a calculation is technically possible using the enzo code , and is a logical extension of our work .",
    "another important consideration is the generation of cosmological initial conditions .",
    "( 2006 ) explore the evolution of the halo mass function at high redshifts , and conclude that the overall mass function is suppressed in simulations whose initial conditions are generated at too late of a redshift .",
    "they suggest that a starting simulation redshift of @xmath320 would be appropriate for the small boxes used in the calculations discussed in this paper .",
    "the magnitude of error involved in simulations s tarting later is not quantified . since",
    "our focus is only on the most massive halo to form in the simulation volume , the magnitude of the bias in our results by starting at @xmath321 is unclear .    a fundamental assumption that we make concerns the validity of the cold dark matter model at mass and spatial scales comparable to , or greater than , the masses of the halos which form population iii stars",

    "2005 ; spergel et  al .",
    "if the power spectrum is suppressed at small scales , this could have significant implications for the formation epoch and properties of population iii stars  ( oshea & norman 2006 ) .",
    "additionally , a running power spectrum or significant changes in @xmath323 or the primordial power spectrum index ( as suggested by the wmap year iii results ) may have significant effects , which should be explored .",
    "in this paper we have performed a suite of twelve high dynamical range simulations of the formation of population iii stars in a @xmath0cdm universe , with the intent to further constrain the variation of accretion rates onto population iii protostellar cores , a parameter that is of crucial importance to the mass scale of population iii stars .",

    "other bulk halo properties , such as spin parameter and angle of separation between gas and dark matter angular momentum vectors , are consistent with previous numerical simulations of much larger cosmological halos , and do not appear to evolve with redshift .",
    "our suite of calculations suggest a clear relationship between halo collapse redshift and environment and the observed accretion rate onto the forming protostellar core , with lower accretion rates seen at higher redshift and in halos which form in significantly overdense regions of the universe .",
