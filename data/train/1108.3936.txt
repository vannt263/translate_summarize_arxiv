    "it is important to investigate the nuclear structure in relation to the above characteristics of the @xmath8 interaction  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become possible to calculate nuclei up to mass around @xmath9 using a @xmath8 interaction with the green s function monte carlo method  ( gfmc ) @xcite .",
    "it is , however , extremely time consuming to apply this method to heavier nuclei .",
    "it is desired to develop a new method to calculate nuclear structure with large nucleon numbers by taking care of the characteristic features of the @xmath8 interaction .",

    "this @xmath10-wave component is found to be spatially compact as compared with the @xmath13-wave component due to the large momentum components brought by the tensor interaction  @xcite .",
    "this effect originates from the pseudo - scalar nature of the one - pion exchange .",

    "this means that there is no truncation of the particle states within the @xmath6 space of tosm .",
    "in particular , the spatial shrinkage of the particle states is essential to obtain convergence of the tensor contribution involving the high momentum components  @xcite , which is also seen in the deuteron .",

    "this result indicates that the level spacing is described well in tosm+ucom , so that we can discuss the structure differences between energy levels . before doing this",
    ", we discuss several reasons of under - binding , which can contribute to the bulk part of the binding energies , such as the continuum effect of extra neutrons having a weak binding nature , higher configurations beyond @xmath6 states in tosm , the genuine three - body interaction , and the improvement of ucom .    as for the continuum effect , the spatial extension of extra neutrons",
    "is explicitly treated in the tosm basis within the @xmath6 excitations using the gaussian expansion method by taking long - range parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss2 ] ) .",
    "however , the continuum effect of extra neutrons is not sufficiently described in the tosm approximation .",
    "when the @xmath6 excitations in tosm are used to describe the @xmath11 tensor correlation in @xmath7he , the extra neutrons still occupy the @xmath19-orbits in the hole states .",
    "this means the continuum effect is not taken into account together with the large energy gain due to the tensor correlation in tosm .",
    "hence , we estimate the correlation energy from the continuum effect by using cosm @xcite , in which each motion of extra neutrons is solved exactly around the core with no tensor correlation , and the continuum effect of multi - neutrons is fully included .",
    "it is obtained that the correlation energies beyond the @xmath19-shell configuration of extra neutrons are estimated as 3.3 mev for @xmath137he and 6.6 mev for @xmath138he in their ground states , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is important then to estimate how many particle - many hole configurations are necessary to include the continuum effect of extra neutrons . for @xmath138he ,",
    "when we limit cosm up to @xmath6 excitations of extra four neutrons , the energy gain is 5.9 mev , which is about 90% of the correlation energy of the continuum effect of 6.6 mev .",

    "furthermore , to satisfy the boundary condition of neutron emissions , it is necessary to connect the tosm basis to the correct asymptotic wave functions such as the @xmath7he+@xmath25+@xmath25 three - body state for @xmath137he @xcite .",
    "this is important to describe the tail behavior of the neutron wave functions .    from the gfmc calculation @xcite",
    ", we can simply estimate the effect of the genuine three - body interaction on the binding energy which increases with the mass number . for @xmath138he , for example , the relative energy gain from three - body interaction is about 5.5 mev as compared with @xmath7he .",
    "this result indicates that for @xmath138he , the total energy gain of about 12 mev is expected considering two effects as the continuum states and the genuine three - body interaction .",
    "hence , the remaining missing energy from the experimental value is estimated to be as small as 3 - 4 mev for @xmath138he from fig .",
    "[ fig : av8 ] .    for the ucom part , we are able to increase the tensor contributions and the binding energies by using @xmath107-ucom , which can improve short - range part of the @xmath12 coupling of the tensor interaction .",

    "when we adjust the mn interaction such as changing the @xmath142 parameter and the strength of the @xmath1 interaction , it is still difficult to reproduce the whole trend of the energies of the ground and excited states of he isotopes consistently .",
