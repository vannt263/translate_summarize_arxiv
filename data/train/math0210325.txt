    ", we will prove a more precise version , which replaces the diffeomorphism group of @xmath6 with its smallest possible subgroup .",
    "for that we need the following    two lagrangian submanifolds @xmath7 and @xmath8 are lagrangian isotopic if there is a continuous family of lagrangian submanifolds @xmath9}$ ] connecting them .    then , we show    [ moser ] for @xmath3 large enough donaldson s @xmath0-transverse lefschetz pencils have vanishing spheres that , up to lagrangian isotopy , are conjugated under the action of the group of symplectomorphisms generated by the dehn twists of the fiber along the vanishing spheres of the pencil itself .",
    "we point out that the conjugating group of symplectomorphisms of theorem [ moser ] is not elementary , as donaldson s pencils exist for large @xmath3 and have @xmath10 singular fibers",

    "note that in the process of proposition [ prop : get_tr ] it is necessary to perturb only @xmath243 .",
