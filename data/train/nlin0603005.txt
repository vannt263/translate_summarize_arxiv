    "among discrete mappings , integrable ones have a rich mathematical structure such as explicit exact solutions , conserved quantities , symmetries , and so on . for example",
    ", most discrete soliton equations belong to the discrete kp hierarchy , have explicit @xmath0 soliton solutions and have an infinite number of explicit conserved quantities@xcite .",
    "the discrete painlev equations have a direct relation to the affine weyl group and their mathematical structure of explicit solutions gives a hot theme@xcite .",
    "integrable systems reflect some aspects of essential mechanism of real nonlinear phenomena in conserved systems and studies on the systems are important subjects .    on the other hand ,",
    "general discrete systems are complex and do not exhibit such explicit mathematical structure as in the case of integrable systems .",
    "however they reflect wider nonlinear phenomena and show a rich structure of solutions , which can not be easily grasped by the integrable system theory . thus extending the theory of integrable systems is an important theme .    in this paper",
    ", we show a link between integrable and nonintegrable mappings . in section  [ sec : derivation ] , we propose a certain type of discrete mappings that possess a discrete analogue of the lyapunov function , which increases or decreases monotonically and converges to a certain value in the course of time evolution@xcite .",
    "we call this function a discrete lyapunov function for short .",
    "the mappings are obtained by extending a class of second - order discrete mappings , the quispel - roberts - thompson ( qrt ) mappings@xcite .",
    "the qrt mappings are integrable and have an explicit conserved quantity that remains constant in the course of time evolution .",
    "the conserved quantity of qrt mappings becomes a discrete lyapunov function in the corresponding extended mappings we propose and a trajectory of solution gets close to an attractor which is defined by the discrete lyapunov function .    in section  [ sec : cont and ultra ]",
    ", we give a differential and an ultradiscrete limit of the mappings@xcite .",
    "the ultradiscrete equation is defined by using @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) operators .",
    "the ultradiscretizing procedure was discovered in the integrable system theory and various discrete soliton equations can be ultradiscretized through a certain type of transformation of variables and parameters .",
    "the differential equations and the ultradiscrete equations obtained from the mappings have also an explicit lyapunov or discrete lyapunov function derived from that of the mappings .    in section  [ sec : application ] , we give some applications of the mappings . preserving monotonicity of the discrete lyapunov functions",
    ", we can construct three types of variant of the mappings , a mapping with an adjusted parameter , a probabilistic mapping and coupled mappings . in section  [ sec : remarks ] , we give concluding remarks .    before going into the main subject , we make a short introduction to the qrt mapping and to the limiting procedures .",
    "the symmetric version of qrt mapping is defined by the following second - order discrete equation@xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 are defined by @xmath6 with symmetric @xmath7 matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 note that ` @xmath11 ' is an outer product . if we define @xmath12 by @xmath13 where @xmath14\\,a\\begin{bmatrix } y^2 \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix } , \\qquad    d(x , y)=[x^2\\ x\\ 1]\\,b\\begin{bmatrix } y^2 \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix},\\ ] ] we can easily show @xmath15 . thus @xmath16 is a conserved quantity of ( [ qrt ] ) and the qrt mapping is integrable .",
    "we can obtain a differential equation from the qrt mapping@xcite .",
    "for example , let us consider a qrt mapping @xmath17 with a conserved quantity @xmath18 if we use a transformation including a new parameter @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 a series expansion of ( [ qrt example ] ) at @xmath21 gives @xmath22 thus we obtain a differential equation @xmath23 as a limit equation of ( [ qrt example ] ) .",
    "this equation is also integrable since it has a conserved quantity derived from @xmath24 , @xmath25    we can also obtain an ultradiscrete mapping from the qrt mapping@xcite",
    ". consider ( [ qrt example ] ) again and use a transformation of variable and parameter including a new parameter @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 then we obtain an equation on @xmath28 , @xmath29 taking a limit @xmath30 and using a formula @xmath31 we obtain @xmath32 this equation is also integrable since it has a conserved quantity derived from @xmath24 , @xmath33",
    "in this paper , we discuss discrete mappings which have the following form , @xmath34 where @xmath5 and @xmath16 are the same as those defined in ( [ qrt sub])@xmath35([n and d ] ) and @xmath36 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "let us consider a solution @xmath37 for @xmath38 from initial data @xmath39 and @xmath40 without loss of generality .",
    "condition for @xmath41 is shown below .",
    "noting @xmath42 and using ( [ general attractor ] ) , we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 therefore , if @xmath45 is a small positive constant and @xmath46 holds for any @xmath47 , then @xmath16 decreases or increases monotonically and converges to @xmath36 .",
    "this condition is rewritten by @xmath48 if this is satisfied , any trajectory of solution gets close to an attractor @xmath49 in a phase plane and @xmath16 becomes a discrete analogue to lyapunov function of a differential equation .",
    "if we solve an inequality ( [ condition ] ) on @xmath41 with ( [ general attractor ] ) , a general condition of @xmath41 is expressed by @xmath50 and @xmath37 . however , since ( [ general attractor ] ) itself includes @xmath41 and a sign of @xmath51 depends on @xmath50 , @xmath37 and @xmath52 , the condition becomes quite complex .",
    "therefore , we choose special matrices @xmath8 or @xmath9 in ( [ a and b ] ) and propose a sufficient condition of @xmath41 to make the mapping ( [ general attractor ] ) rational .",
    "if we choose a matrix @xmath9 as @xmath53 then @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath24 become as follows : @xmath56 in this case , ( [ qrt ] ) is of class after refs .",
    "@xcite and ( [ general attractor ] ) becomes @xmath57 the condition ( [ condition ] ) is reduced to @xmath58 the latter inequality gives @xmath59 then we can derive a sufficient condition for @xmath41 , @xmath60 using @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ fig : class1 p=1 ] shows solutions to ( [ class1 ] ) plotted in the phase plane using @xmath41 defined by @xmath63 with an additional parameter @xmath64 satisfying @xmath65 . note that @xmath66 and the condition @xmath67 in ( [ class1 condition ] ) is satisfied in this case .",
    "the only fixed point @xmath68 exists and does not depend on @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig : class1 p=1 ] ( a ) shows a solution to ( [ class1 ] ) with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the trajectory rapidly gets close to an attractor @xmath49 in the outer region .",
    "parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : class1 p=1 ] ( b ) are all the same as of fig .",
    "[ fig : class1 p=1 ] ( a ) other than @xmath71 .",
    "this trajectory moves in the inner region of the attractor and also approaches it rapidly .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we propose second - order discrete mappings as an extension of the qrt mappings .",
    "they have an explicit discrete lyapunov function and the asymptotic behavior of a solution is clearly understood .",
    "the function is the same as the conserved quantity of the corresponding qrt mapping .",
    "this fact suggests that we can extend an integrable system to nonintegrable one together with its characteristic structure .",
    "moreover , a differential and an ultradiscrete equations corresponding to the mapping can be derived by taking a limit of a parameter .",
    "both equations have also an explicit lyapunov function .",
    "thus we give a set of discrete , differential and ultradiscrete equations of which behavior of solutions obey the same structure .",
    "there are many examples of this kind of set among integrable equations .",
    "it suggests that there may be some mathematical structure in the equations proposed .",
    "note that although it is not so difficult to construct a differential equation with an explicit lyapunov function , it is difficult to discretize or ultradiscretize the equation together with its lyapunov function .",
    "we show some applications of the discrete mappings .",
    "we give a mapping with an adjusted parameter , a probabilistic mapping and coupled mappings preserving the discrete lyapunov function .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the existence of the function makes it possible to construct applicable systems of which behavior is easy to control .",
    "* it is clear that the mapping proposed is nonintegrable since they are not reversible .",
    "however , more detailed study may reveal a relation between the mapping and its integrable correspondence .",
    "* there may be another characteristic quantity of the mappings . utilizing the quantity together with the lyapunov function",
    ", we may be able to give more information about solutions . *",
    "though we concentrate on modifying the qrt mapping , a similar procedure may be applied to other integrable mappings . generalizing the method used",
    "is an interesting problem .",
    "* we propose the applications of mappings only as demonstrative examples .",
    "we should find an application as a model of more realistic phenomenon .",
