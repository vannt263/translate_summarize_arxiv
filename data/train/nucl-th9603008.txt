    "with the advent of experimental facilities such as cebaf , which are capable of probing hadronic systems at energies where relativistic effects become important , the development of theoretical frameworks in which consistent relativistic calculations of few - body hadronic systems can be performed is no longer merely desirable , it is essential .    an obvious starting point for such a calculation in a two - body system ( such as the deuteron ) is the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for the four - dimensional , covariant , two - to - two amplitude @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the free two - particle propagator , which in our convention is @xmath3 with @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 is a positive infinitessimal and @xmath7 is the bethe - salpeter kernel  @xcite . in principle",
    "@xmath7 should include all two - particle irreducible two - to - two feynman graphs .",
    "solution of ( [ eq : bse ] ) with the full two - particle irreducible kernel is impractical and usually resort is made to the ladder approximation  @xcite .",
    "some undesirable features attend this approximation ( see  @xcite for a full discussion ) , not the least of which is the fact that the ladder bse does not have the correct one - body limit  @xcite .",
    "( an equation is said to have the correct one - body limit if , when the mass of one particle is taken to infinity , the equation reduces to the klein - gordon or dirac equation for the light particle moving in the static field of the now infinitely massive source . ) by contrast , the full bse ( [ eq : bse ] ) does possess the correct one - body limit .",
    "three - dimensional quasi - potential equations ( qpes ) are realized by rewriting the bethe - salpeter equation for the two - particle amplitude ( [ eq : bse ] ) as a pair of coupled equations : @xmath8 where the propagator @xmath9 is arbitrary .",
    "if @xmath9 is chosen to contain a one - dimensional delta function constraining the relative four - momentum , then eq .  ( [ eq : qpe ] ) becomes a three - dimensional equation for the amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "examples of this approach include the equations of blankenbecler - sugar  @xcite and gross  @xcite . in principle",
    "the driving term @xmath10 should be determined by solving the four - dimensional integral equation ( [ eq : ueqn ] ) .",
    "however , given the difficulty of solving such equations , and our lack of knowledge about the best form of @xmath7 for hadronic physics , usually @xmath10 is chosen to be a one - boson exchange interaction : @xmath11 the t - matrix then obeys the three - dimensional integral equation @xmath12 a reasonable description of few - hadron systems is obtained by fitting coupling constants and some mass parameters of @xmath13 to the nucleon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "( examples of this approach include , but are by no means limited to , refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the qpe formalism of gross obeys the one - body limit  @xcite .",
    "another variant of the quasi - potential approach which respects the one - body limit was derived by wallace and mandelzweig in references  @xcite .",
    "we provide a generalization of that formalism in this paper .",
    "as originally derived , the qpe of wallace and mandelzweig contains , for the nucleon - nucleon system , a one - boson exchange potential which is instant in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "this involves the use of a constraint on the relative four - momentum , @xmath14 , of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total two - body four - momentum . in the center - of - mass frame ,",
    "the equation for the deuteron vertex function takes the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 refers to the wallace - mandelzweig choice for the propagator @xmath9 .",
    "the formalism is covariant since the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is expressed covariantly and the pair of equations ( [ eq : wdinst ] ) and ( [ eq : ueqn ] ) is equivalent to the bound - state bse : @xmath19 eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdinst ] ) for the cm frame deuteron vertex function has been used in recent work by devine and wallace  @xcite .",
    "this formalism may be developed in a manifestly covariant fashion following the technique of fuda  @xcite .",
    "this involves writing all four - vectors in terms of their components parallel and perpendicular to the total four - momentum : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , with @xmath22 .",
    "a fundamental flaw exists in quasipotential formalisms that are based on a form for @xmath9 which contains a delta function .",
    "it is generally impossible to systematically correct the lowest - order approximation by use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ueqn ] ) because unphysical singularities arise . in two - body hadronic systems , such as the deuteron",
    ", calculations may still be pursued using equations such as ( [ eq : wdinst ] ) which are themselves free of these singularities .",
    "on the other hand , in any electromagnetic reaction where the photon momentum @xmath23 is non - zero , the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) can not hold for the initial and final - state relative four - momenta in the cm frame  @xcite .",
    "therefore a boosted vertex function is required for electromagnetic matrix element calculations , or , for that matter , for any qpe calculation in a three - body problem .",
    "a boost equation for the quasipotential may be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ueqn ] ) , but unphysical singularities arise in the boosted interaction  @xcite .",
    "these are removed from the theory if the full result for @xmath10 , as defined by ( [ eq : ueqn ] ) , is used in the quasi - potential equation , but no truncation of @xmath10 at any finite order in @xmath24 is free of singularities .",
    "therefore , in this paper we seek a general procedure for the reduction of four - dimensional equations which _ does not involve the use of delta functions_. we develop a procedure by which a four - dimensional equation may be approximated by a three - dimensional equation and the interaction in that equation improved systematically .",
    "the technique is presented in section  [ sec - section2 ] .",
    "it has a close connection to the work of klein  @xcite on three - dimensional reductions of four - dimensional equations , and to standard time - ordered perturbation theory , as discussed in section  [ sec - section3 ] .    in general",
    "the interaction in the three - dimensional equations we discuss is not covariant .",
    "but , since the application of our delta - function - free reduction technique to infinite order produces an equation equivalent to the original four - dimensional equation , the sum of all terms in the three - dimensional formalism must produce covariant results .",
    "in nuclear physics it is known that contributions which are of higher - order in the coupling are of increasingly shorter range .",
    "such short - range contributions to hadronic interactions must always be treated in an essentially phenomenological manner .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a truncation of the interaction at some finite order in the coupling will be useful for applications",
    ". it should always be appropriate to absorb the effects of the neglected higher - order graphs into phenomenological parameters , thus ameliorating the non - covariance of the theory .",
    "in particular , we show in section  [ sec - section3 ] that the leading - order boost corrections to the interaction obtained by forest , pandharipande and friar  @xcite are indeed contained within our truncated interaction .    in section  [ sec - section4 ]",
    "we show that the crossed - box graph may be approximately rewritten as an iterate of the ladder kernel : @xmath25 where the form of @xmath26 is derived in section  [ sec - section4 ] .",
    "in particular , this approximation is exact in the high - energy ( eikonal ) and one - body limits , and may be systematically improved upon in other regimes .",
    "this leads us to propose the four - dimensional integral equation : @xmath27 this equation has the correct one - body limit and results from an approximate resummation of the bse kernel @xmath7 .",
    "it reduces to the wallace - mandelzweig equation ( [ eq : wdinst ] ) if the dependence of @xmath28 on the time component of the relative four - momentum in the cm frame is neglected",
    ". a three - dimensional reduction of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4dwm ] ) using the method developed in section  [ sec - section2 ] provides a systematic way to include retardation effects , and so improve on eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdinst ] ) .",
    "this reduction to a three - dimensional equation is performed in section  [ sec - section5 ] .",
    "the dynamical boost of the three - dimensional interaction present in the equation is realized through simple dependence of the interaction on the total three momentum and energy of the system , thus eliminating the boost problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdinst ] ) .    in section  [ sec - section6 ] the predictions of the three - dimensional integral equation obtained in section  [ sec - section5 ] are compared to those of five other bound - state equations : the ladder bse and eq .",
    "( [ eq:4dwm ] ) , both of which are , of course , four - dimensional equations , and the three - dimensional equations of salpeter , klein and wallace & mandelzweig .",
    "the results of sections [ sec - section3][sec - section5 ] are presented concurrently for a scalar and a spinor field theory . in particular ,",
    "in the scalar case we use the @xmath29 field theory , defined by the lagrangian @xmath30 coupling terms include mass factors so that the couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 are dimensionless , thus ensuring that the limits @xmath33 and @xmath34 correspond to the appropriate one - body limits .",
    "it is this field theory in which the numerical calculations of section  [ sec - section6 ] are performed . in the spinor case",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath35 the arguments of sections [ sec - section3][sec - section5 ] are , in fact , quite general , and , with small modifications , also apply to field theories involving other types of particles .",
    "consider the bethe - salpeter equation for the bound - state vertex function @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 here @xmath16 is the total two - body four - momentum , and @xmath14 and @xmath38 are the relative four - momenta .",
    "this equation is completely general , and applies to the bound - state vertex function in any field theory . throughout this paper",
    "we find it convenient to omit the explicit integration from such equations , abbreviating them as follows @xmath39    suppose that the driving term of this equation , @xmath7 , is separated into two pieces : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is three - dimensional in the sense that it does not depend on the zeroth component of the relative four - momenta @xmath14 and @xmath38 .",
    "for instance , if ( [ eq : bsbse ] ) was being solved in the two - body center - of - mass frame and @xmath7 was a one - boson - exchange kernel then @xmath41 could be chosen to be the usual static one - boson - exchange kernel .",
    "note that even though the whole driving term @xmath7 is lorentz covariant , because the restriction on @xmath41 is frame dependent , the pieces @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not .",
    "the splitting of @xmath7 leads to the following coupled equations for @xmath36 : @xmath43 both these equations are four - dimensional , however , @xmath44 has no dependence on the zeroth component of the relative four - momentum because of the defining condition of @xmath41 .",
    "meanwhile , the second equation may be formally solved to obtain : @xmath45^{-1 }   k_2 g_0 \\gamma _ 1   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\gamma _ 1 + \\left [ 1 -   k_2 g_0 \\right]^{-1 } \\gamma _ 1 .",

    "this practice continues below and the context should make it clear whether the equation in question is a three or four - dimensional one .    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rtpt ] ) and ( [ eq : gg ] ) are exactly equivalent to the original bse ( [ eq : bsbse ] ) . in order to reconstruct the bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath36 from the non - covariant three - dimensional @xmath44 one must use eq.([eq : gamma2 ] ) rearranged into the form @xmath51^{-1 } \\gamma _ 1.\\ ] ]    the green s function , @xmath52 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : reint ] ) is , in fact , the fourier transform of the corresponding equal - time co - ordinate space green s function @xmath53 .",
    "this may be seen by defining @xmath54 where @xmath9 is the appropriate four - dimensional two - body green s function , then inserting the integral representation of the delta functions and taking the fourier transform  @xcite .    if @xmath41 is now chosen to be a cm - frame instant interaction , @xmath55 , then ( [ eq : gg ] ) may be taken to define @xmath48 order by order in @xmath56 .",
    "this provides a systematic way to calculate retardation corrections to the salpeter equation  @xcite @xmath57 which results from taking @xmath48 at zeroth order in @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , at first order in @xmath56 we find that : @xmath58 the use of this three - dimensional propagator in place of @xmath59 in ( [ eq : rtpt ] ) would therefore incorporate leading - order retardation corrections in the three - dimensional equation .",
    "there is , however , a general way to account for all the relative - energy integrations in the modified green s function @xmath52 .",
    "recall that the choice of @xmath41 is subject only to the constraint that it should not depend on the zeroth component of the relative four - momentum in , say , the cm frame .",
    "consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : gg ] ) rewritten as @xmath60 and choose @xmath41 such that @xmath61 .",

    "it follows that @xmath41 is the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) interaction , where two - particle irreducibility is defined with respect to the three - dimensional propagator @xmath59 . to show this formally ,",

    "( [ eq : rearrange ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k1 ] ) produces @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the three - dimensional t - matrix corresponding to the bethe - salpeter t - matrix @xmath0 .",
    "thus @xmath41 is , indeed , the irreducible interaction which produces the t - matrix @xmath70 using the propagator @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore expect that the rules for the construction of @xmath41 will be akin to those for the two - particle irreducible interaction in time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "the connection to time - ordered perturbation theory ( topt ) emerges for a simplified dynamics in which only positive - energy states are kept in @xmath2 . for the case of a field theory of nucleons and pions it has been shown that the green s function @xmath72 obeys the rules of topt in the no - anti - nucleon case  @xcite .",
    "the same derivations suffice to prove the result for the scalar field theories defined in the introduction .",
    "it therefore immediately follows that @xmath41 is the 2pi topt amplitude in the case that only positive - energy states are kept in @xmath2 .",
    "we now provide a specific example of the derivation of the time - ordered perturbation theory amplitude by this route .",
    "firstly , it is true in general that , if in eq .",

    "secondly , suppose that @xmath7 is expanded according to the power of the coupling constant in each of its contributions , i.e. , @xmath74 and for the moment only the second - order , or ladder , contribution to @xmath7 is kept , i.e. , ( [ eq : k12 ] ) is rewritten as : @xmath75 we now calculate this amplitude in the absence of negative - energy states .",

    "this procedure allows the calculation of @xmath76 in any frame .",
    "indeed , it is completely general , and can be used to calculate @xmath41 no matter what @xmath7 is chosen .",
    "if the total four - momentum of the two - body system in the frame of interest is written @xmath77 , then it is seen that @xmath76 takes the standard form of topt : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) has the argument @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) in place of @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",

    "@xcite , that this leading - order boost correction is sufficiently accurate for studies of three - nucleon systems , then the boost effects incorporated in the topt result ( [ eq : toptope ] ) should be more than adequate . indeed , we believe such a boost to be preferable to that of eq .",

    "now the three - dimensional propagator is @xmath121 ( where once again we have omitted the momentum - space delta - function for notational simplicity ) , which is the salpeter propagator  @xcite .",

    "if both these last two conditions are satisfied then the denominator for the relevant state is the topt denominator for that state , but with @xmath128 replaced by @xmath129 . note that these are not the rules for the amplitude obtained from the ladder bse .",

    "consequently the first ( last ) event in the diagram need not be the creation of the @xmath132 or @xmath133 pair , it may be the creation out of ( destruction into ) the vacuum of a @xmath134 or @xmath135 state .",
    "( see for instance the second graph in figure  [ fig - fig2 ] . )",
    "the possibility of such an event happening before or after the @xmath132 or @xmath133 propagation in some contributions to @xmath131 leads to denominators which differ from the topt ones in those pieces of @xmath131 .",

    "this equivalence of @xmath131 and the time - ordered perturbation theory green s function in the absence of such terms from the hamiltonian was demonstrated for a field theory of nucleons and pions by kvinikhidze and blankleider  @xcite .    as discussed in section  [ sec - section2 ] , the use of a static interaction in the bethe - salpeter equation leads to the salpeter equation ( [ eq : saleq ] ) .",

    "the calculations in the second group always predict deeper binding than the corresponding calculations in the first group . in other words , the inclusion of pieces of higher - order graphs in the kernel of the integral equation yields deeper binding at a given coupling .",
    "the first - order relative - energy integration ( klein - type ) interactions give predictions for the bound - state spectra which are significantly closer to those of the full four - dimensional calculation than the spectra of the instant equations .",
    "all of these results can be understood on physical grounds .",
    "point 1 arises because the inclusion of retardation in the scalar field theory always reduces the amount of attraction in the bound - state .",
    "an example of this is provided by one - sigma exchange .",
    "when the full retardation corrections predicted by time - ordered perturbation theory are included the instant potential ( [ eq : vsiginst ] ) is replaced by the retarded interaction ( [ eq : toptope ] ) ( provided the effects of negative - energy states are ignored ) . if @xmath249 this will always be a negative number that is smaller in magnitude than the instant potential .",
    "meanwhile , the inclusion of pieces of additional higher - order graphs leads to deeper binding since in the @xmath29 theory _ all _ time - ordered perturbation theory graphs are attractive in the bound - state region .",
    "most significant though , in our opinion , is point 3 , which shows that the first - order relative - energy integration ( klein - type ) potentials do a better job than the instant interactions of approximating the four - dimensional equation which both are derived from .",
    "all six of these calculations aim to sum the main contributions to the two - to - two amplitude .",
    "however , figure [ fig - bsspectra ] shows that they give different results , and so they can not all be correct .",
    "the question therefore arises : what is the binding energy at a given coupling if the full scattering series is summed ?",
    "a partial answer to this question was recently provided by nieuwenhuis and tjon , who summed the series of all ladder and crossed - ladder diagrams using monte carlo integration techniques in the feynman - schwinger representation , and so obtained two - body bound - state masses in this scalar theory  @xcite .",
    "their results , calculated at six different coupling strengths , show that the sum of all such graphs predicts deeper binding than _ any _ of our six integral equation calculations .",
    "in particular , the et appears to do the best job of reproducing the bound - state spectrum obtained by nieuwenhuis and tjon . at first sight",
    "this appears to recommend the et as the best formalism for doing three - dimensional calculations .",
    "however , two points must be remembered before a definite conclusion is drawn .",
    "firstly , the reason that the nieuwenhuis - tjon calculation predicts so much more binding than the two four - dimensional integral equation calculations performed here is precisely the fact discussed in connection with point 2 above : in the @xmath29 theory _ all _ time - ordered perturbation theory graphs give attraction in the bound - state region .",
    "hence the nieuwenhuis - tjon calculation , which includes many more such graphs than both the ladder bse and four - dimensional wallace - mandelzweig equation calculations , _ must _ predict more binding .",
    "therefore , we claim that the salpeter and et equations do a `` better '' job of imitating the full nieuwenhuis - tjon calculation than the ladder bse and four - dimensional wallace - mandelzweig equation because instant calculations such as the salpeter and et ones ignore two competing effects .    1 .",
    "higher - order graphs are left out of their kernel .",
    "if included these graphs would lead to deeper binding at a given coupling .",
    "exchanged - meson retardation is completely ignored .",
    "if included this retardation would lead to shallower binding at a given coupling .",
    "in other words , we claim that the et formalism s apparent success is due to the cancellation of these two neglected effects and can not necessarily be interpreted as a signal of that approach having the `` right physics '' for the problem .    secondly ,",
    "_ none _ of these calculations have been performed in the way that calculations in few - body hadronic physics are usually performed .",
    "when such bound - state calculations are done in hadronic physics one usually acknowledges that the use of _ any _ integral equation necessarily means the neglect of some graphs of the theory , and so one regards the couplings that appear in that equation as effective .",
    "these couplings are then usually fixed by fitting to some set of observables , and then certain different observables are predicted .",
    "this makes the connection to an underlying field theory somewhat more tenuous , but it does allow calculation to proceed in situations where :    * the value of the coupling which appears in the `` fundamental '' lagrangian is not known . *",
    "the problem is highly non - perturbative and consequently _ any _ truncation is somewhat suspect .    therefore , to test the procedure of section  [ sec - section2 ] for deriving three - dimensional integral equations in a way consistent with that in which it would be used in hadronic physics , we fix the mass of the bound - state at @xmath250 and calculate the wave - functions @xmath251 for each of the four different three - dimensional calculations .",
    "( here @xmath9 is the free two - particle green s function for the relevant calculation . )",
    "each three - dimensional wave - function must be normalized according to @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the full two - particle green s function appearing in the three - dimensional equation from which @xmath36 was obtained .",
    "these wave - functions are then compared to the four - dimensional wave functions , integrated over the zeroth component of the relative four - momentum : @xmath254 here @xmath9 is the appropriate free two - particle four - dimensional green s function .",
    "the four - dimensional vertex function used in ( [ eq:4dwf ] ) is normalized according to : @xmath255 where @xmath253 is the full two - particle green s function appearing in the four - dimensional equation from which @xmath36 was obtained .",
    "the left - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3dnormn ] ) and ( [ eq:4dnormn ] ) may be reduced to two ( and four)-dimensional integrals using the fact that the @xmath246-wave wave - function @xmath256 is angle - independent .",
    "note that in the four - dimensional case , wick rotation in the zeroth component allows use of the vertex function on the @xmath248 or @xmath196 imaginary axis .",
    "when the normalized wave - functions of the equations in group 1 ( group 2 ) are compared the results shown in figure  [ fig - wfcomp1 ] ( [ fig - wfcomp2 ] ) are obtained .",
    "it is immediately seen that all the wave - functions at this bound - state mass have essentially the same features . however , in both figures it is clear that the three - dimensional equation with the first - order relative - energy integration , or klein - type , interaction reproduces the integrated four - dimensional wave function considerably more accurately than the instant calculation does .",
    "this shows that the procedure given in section 2 _ does _ provide a way to systematically derive three - dimensional equations which are closer to their four - dimensional counterparts than those which are obtained from merely adopting an instant interaction .",
    "quasi - potential equations ( qpes ) , despite their success as a basis for hadronic phenomenology , can not be improved upon systematically .",
    "this is because whenever they are used beyond first - order they predict amplitudes with unphysical singularities .",
    "these singularities also appear whenever attempts are made to boost the interaction appearing in the qpe from one frame to another .",
    "they arise from these equations use of delta - function constraints on the relative four - momentum .    because of this shortcoming of qpes , in section  [ sec - section2 ] of this paper we sought , and found , a systematic procedure for deriving three - dimensional equations from four - dimensional ones which does not involve the use of delta functions . as shown in section  [ sec - section3 ] , this procedure is akin to the work of klein .",
    "it allows the derivation of a three - dimensional kernel which includes , in a systematic expansion which may be pursued to any desired accuracy , the effects of the relative - energy integration present in the four - dimensional integral equation . if the procedure is applied to infinite order , a result equivalent to the original four - dimensional equation is obtained . at any order",
    "the kernel derived has a simple interpretation in terms of the diagrams of time - ordered perturbation theory , except that the presence of negative - energy states requires additional rules .",
    "the resultant three - dimensional equations therefore include more of the meson - retardation effects than quasi - potential equations , and incorporate the effects of a dynamical boost .",
    "since the bse with any kernel which is a finite sum of feynman graphs does not have the correct one - body limit , if the procedure of section  [ sec - section2 ] is directly applied to any solvable bse a three - dimensional equation without the correct one - body limit is found .",
    "however , as demonstrated by wallace  @xcite , and recapitulated here in section  [ sec - section4 ] , a bethe - salpeter equation with the correct one - body limit may be reorganized so that the pieces of the kernel which contribute at leading order in the one - body limit take on an iterative form .",
    "hence a four - dimensional equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.19 ] ) , with the correct one - body limit and meson - production thresholds is derived .",
    "a further approximation leads to a simple four - dimensional equation to which the procedure of section  [ sec - section2 ] may be applied , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.20 ] ) . in making that approximation",
    "some of the meson - production thresholds are displaced .",
    "nevertheless , the equation still has exactly the correct cut - structure for @xmath257 .    in section  [ sec - section5 ]",
    "the procedure of section  [ sec - section2 ] was applied to the four - dimensional equation ( [ eq:3.20 ] ) .",
    "the result is a simple three - dimensional equation with the correct one - body limit which has straightforward boost properties .",
    "the main shortcoming of this equation is the fact that certain thresholds of the original bethe - salpeter wave function are modified in the three - dimensional wave function .",
    "however , this modification is due to the approximation in moving from ( [ eq:3.19 ] ) to ( [ eq:3.20 ] ) , rather than to any deficiencies of our procedure for deriving three - dimensional equations . it could be systematically corrected for , at the price of complicating the three - dimensional kernel .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - section6 ] we compared and contrasted the bound - state properties predicted by six different bound - state equations in a scalar field theory .",
    "a first group of equations contained the ladder bethe - salpeter equation and two three - dimensional equations based on it : the salpeter equation , and the equation obtained by applying our method to first order  which we referred to as the klein equation , since the formula obtained for the three - dimensional interaction appears in klein s work . in the second group were eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.20 ] ) , the so - called equal - time equation and the equation derived in section  [ sec - section6 ] .",
    "it was found that in each group of three equations the equation derived by the klein - like delta - function - free reduction technique of section  [ sec - section2 ] approximated its parent four - dimensional equation better than the corresponding instant equation did .",
    "however , the bound - state spectra from the instant et equation lies closest to the bound - state spectrum obtained from the sum of ladder and crossed - ladder graphs , as calculated by nieuwenhuis and tjon  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood on physical grounds and , we argued , is not necessarily a recommendation for the use of the et equation in physical systems .",
    "indeed , when the wave functions of a two - body system in a scalar field theory are examined it is seen that the equation derived in section  [ sec - section5 ] does a much better job of reproducing the integrated four - dimensional wave function than the et equation wave function does .",
    "the results of section  [ sec - section6 ] are in harmony with recent results for phase shifts in scalar - scalar scattering obtained by lahiff and afnan  @xcite .",
    "they found that the klein method reproduces the phase shifts obtained from the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation much better than a blankenbecler - sugar calculation with an instant interaction .",
    "these formal and numerical results indicate that the procedure of section  [ sec - section2 ] is successful in its goal of providing a way to systematically obtain three - dimensional equations from four - dimensional ones without the use of delta functions . in particular ,",
    "when applied to the four - dimensional equation ( [ eq:3.20 ] ) this procedure yields a three - dimensional equation which , unlike the corresponding quasi - potential equation ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) , has a well - defined boost .",
    "this would seem to make such an equation a good starting point for calculations in few - hadron systems ."
