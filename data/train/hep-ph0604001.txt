    "the top quark , with a mass of the order of the electroweak scale @xmath3[1 ] is the heaviest particle yet discovered and might be the first place in which the new physics effects could be appeared .",
    "the properties of the top quark could reveal information regarding flavor physics , electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) mechanism , as well as new physics beyond the standard model(sm)[2 ] .",
    "hadron colliders , such as the tevatron and the cern large hadron collider(lhc ) , can be seen as top quark factories .",
    "one of the primary goals for the tevatron and the lhc is to determine the top quark properties and see whether any hint of non - sm effects may be visible .",
    "thus , studying the top quark production at hadron colliders is of great interest .",
    "it can help the collider experiments to probe ewsb mechanism and test the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "in the context of the sm , top quark can be produced singly via electroweak interactions involving the @xmath4 vertex .",
    "there are three production processes which are distinguished by the virtuality @xmath5 of the electroweak gauge boson @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the four - momentum of the gauge boson @xmath8[2 ] .",
    "the first process is the so - called @xmath9-gluon fusion , or t - channel process , which is the dominant process involving a space - like @xmath9 boson(@xmath10 ) both at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "if a @xmath11 quark distribution function is introduced into the calculation , the leading order process for the @xmath9-gluon fusion channel is the t - channel process @xmath12 including @xmath13[3 ] .",
    "the second process is the s - channel process @xmath14 mediated by a time - like @xmath9 boson ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "single top quark can also be produced in association with a real @xmath9 boson(@xmath16 ) .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath17 associated production process is negligible at the tevatron , but of considerable size at the lhc , where the production cross section is larger than that of the s - channel process .    at the leading order , the production cross sections for all of three processes are proportional to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix element @xmath18 .",
    "thus , measuring the cross section of single top production generally provides a direct probe of @xmath19 , the effective @xmath4 vertex , further the strength and handedness of the top charged - current couplings .",
    "this fact has already motivated large number of dedicated experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "since the cross section of single top production is smaller than that of the @xmath20 production and the final state signals suffer from large background , the observation of the single top events is even more challenging than @xmath20 .",
    "it is expected that increased luminosity and improved methods of analysis will eventually achieve detection of single top events .",
    "so far , there are not single top events to be observed . the cross sections of single top production for the s- and t - channels might be observed at the tevatron run ii with a small data sample of only a few @xmath21 .",
    "however , the lhc can precisely measure single top production , the ckm matrix element @xmath22 could be measured down to less than one percent error at the atlas detector[4 ] .    the three processes for single top production can be affected by new physics beyond the sm in two ways . one way proceeds via the modification of the sm couplings between the known particles , such as @xmath4 and @xmath23 couplings , and other way involves the effects of new particles that couple to the top quark .",
    "certainly , these two classifications can be seen to overlap in the limit , in which the extra particles are heavy and decouple from the low energy description .",
    "the sm couplings between the ordinary particles take well defined and calculable values in the sm , any deviation from these values would indicate the presence of new physics .",
    "thus , single top production at hadron colliders might be sensitive to certain effects of new physics and studying the non - sm effects on single top production is very interesting and needed .    to address ewsb and the hierarchy problem in the sm , many alternative new physics models , such as supersymmetry , extra dimensions , topcolor , and the recently little higgs models , have been proposed over the past three decades . of particular interest to us",
    "is the little higgs models[5 ] . in this kind of models ,",
    "the higgs particle is a pseudo - goldstone boson of a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken at some high scales .",
    "ewsb is induced by radiative corrections leading to a coleman - weinberg type of potential .",
    "quadratic divergence cancellations of radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass are due to contributions from new particles with the same spin as the sm particles",
    ". some of these new particles can generate characteristic signatures at the present and future collider experiments[6,7 ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the effects of the little higgs models on single top production and see whether the corrections of the little higgs models to the cross section of single top production can be detected at the lhc .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall briefly summarize some coupling expressions in the little higgs models , which are related to single top production .",
    "the contributions of the correction terms for the tree - level @xmath4 and @xmath2 couplings to single top production at the lhc are calculated in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the corrections of the new charged gauge bosons , such as @xmath1 and @xmath24 , predicted by the little higgs models , to single top production at the lhc .",
    "our conclusions and discussions are given in section 5 .",
    "there are several variations of the little higgs models , which differ in the assumed higher symmetry and in the representations of the scalar multiplets . according the structure of the extended electroweak gauge group ,",
    "the little higgs models can be generally divided into two classes[6,8 ] : product group models , in which the sm @xmath25 is embedded in a product gauge group , and simple group models , in which it is embedded in a larger simple group .",
    "the littlest higgs model(lh)[9 ] and the @xmath0 simple group model[8,10 ] are the simplest examples of the product group models and the simple group models , respectively .",
    "to predigestion our calculation , we will discuss single top production at the lhc in the context of these two simplest models .",
    "the lh model[9 ] consists of a nonlinear @xmath26 model with a global @xmath27 symmetry and a locally gauged symmetry @xmath28^{2}$ ] .",
    "the global @xmath27 symmetry is broken down to its subgroup @xmath29 at a scale @xmath30 , which results in 14 goldstone bosons(gb s ) .",
    "four of these gb s are eaten by the gauge bosons(@xmath31 ) , resulting from the breaking of @xmath28^{2}$ ] , giving them mass .",
    "the higgs boson remains as a light pseudo - goldstone boson , and other gb s give mass to the sm gauge bosons and form a higgs field triplet .",
    "the gauge and yukawa couplings radiative generate a higgs potential and trigger ewsb . in the lh model ,",
    "the couplings constants of the sm gauge boson @xmath9 and the new gauge boson @xmath32 to ordinary particles , which are related to our calculation , can be written as[11 ] : @xmath33 , \\hspace{12mm}g_{r}^{wtb}=0;\\\\ g_{l}^{wqq'}&=&\\frac{ie}{\\sqrt{2}s_{w}}[1-\\frac{v^{2}}{2f^{2}}c^{2}(c^{2}-s^{2})],\\hspace{23mm}g_{r}^{wqq'}=0;\\\\ g_{l}^{w_{h}tb}&=&g_{l}^{w_{h}qq'}=\\frac{ie}{\\sqrt{2}s_{w}}\\frac{c}{s},\\hspace{38mm}g_{r}^{w_{h}tb}=g_{r}^{w_{h}qq'}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the electroweak scale and @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the weinberg angle .",
    "@xmath37 is the mixing parameter between @xmath38 and @xmath39 gauge bosons and the mixing parameter @xmath40 comes from the mixing between the sm top quark @xmath41 and the vector - like top quark @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the yukawa coupling parameters .",
    "the @xmath45 doublet quarks @xmath46 represent @xmath47 or @xmath48 . in above equations , we have assumed @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath0 simple group model[8,10 ] consists of two @xmath26 model with a global symmetry @xmath50^{2}$ ] and a gauge symmetry @xmath51 .",
    "the global symmetry is spontaneously broken down to its subgroup @xmath28^{2}$ ] by two vacuum condensates @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . at the same time , the gauge symmetry is broken down to the sm gauge group @xmath54 and the global symmetry is broken explicitly down to its diagonal subgroup @xmath55 by the gauge interactions .",
    "this breaking scenario gives rise to an @xmath25 doublet gauge bosons @xmath56 and a new neutral gauge boson @xmath57 .",
    "due to the gauged @xmath0 symmetry in the @xmath0 simple group model , all of the sm fermion representations have to be extended to transform as fundamental ( or antifundamental ) representations of @xmath0 , which demands the existence of new heavy fermions in all three generations .",
    "the fermion sector of the @xmath0 simple group model can be constructed in two ways : universal and anomaly free , which might induce the different signatures at the high energy collider experiments .",
    "however , the coupling forms of the gauge bosons @xmath9 and @xmath58 to the sm quarks can be unitive written as[6 ] : @xmath59 with @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "using these feynmen rules , we will estimate the contributions of the lh model and the @xmath0 simple group model to single top production at the lhc in the following sections .",
    "for the t - channel process @xmath12 , at the leading order , there is only one diagram with @xmath9 exchange in the t - channel . in the context of the little higgs models",
    ", the corresponding scattering amplitude can be written as : @xmath64 [ \\overline{u}(t)\\gamma_{\\mu}p_{l}u(b)],\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the left - handed prosection operator .",
    "@xmath671 and 2 represent the lh model and the @xmath0 simple group model , respectively . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the correction terms for the @xmath4 and @xmath2 couplings induced by these two little higgs models , which have been given in eqs.(1,2,4,5 ) .    in the context of the little higgs models ,",
    "the scattering amplitude of the s - channel process @xmath14 can be written as : @xmath70 [ \\overline{u}(t)\\gamma_{\\mu}p_{l}\\nu(\\overline{b})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the center - of - mass energy of the subprocess @xmath14 .    at the leading order ,",
    "the production of single top quark in association with a @xmath9 boson is given via the processes mediated by the s - channel @xmath11 quark exchange and the u - channel top quark exchange .",
    "in the little higgs models , the tree - level coupling of the gluon to a pair of fermions is same as that in the sm , thus the scattering amplitude of this process can be written as : @xmath73u(b),\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "after calculating the cross sections @xmath76 for the t - channel , s - channel , and @xmath17 associated production processes , the total cross section @xmath77 for each process of single top production at the lhc can be obtained by convoluting @xmath78 $ ] with the parton distribution functions(pdf s ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the possible combination of incoming gluon , quark , antiquark .",
    "@xmath82 is the pdf evaluated at the factorization scale @xmath83 . through out this paper , we neglect all quark masses with the exception of @xmath84 , use cteq6l pdf with @xmath85[12 ] , and take the center - of - mass energy @xmath86 for the process @xmath87 at the lhc .    to obtain numerical results , we need to specify the relevant sm parameters .",
    "these parameters are @xmath84=172.7gev[1 ] , @xmath88=1/128.8 , @xmath89=0.118 , @xmath90=0.2315 , and @xmath91=80.425 + gev[13 ] . except for these sm input parameters , the contributions of the lh model and the @xmath0 simple group model to single top quark production are dependent on the free parameters ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) and ( @xmath92 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) , respectively . considering the constraints of the electroweak precision data on these free parameters , we will assume @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the lh model[14 ] and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for the @xmath0 simple group model[6,8,10 ] , in our numerical estimation .",
    "the relative corrections of the lh model and the @xmath0 simple group model to the cross section @xmath103 of single top production at the lhc are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 , respectively . in these figures ,",
    "we have taken @xmath104 , @xmath105 and three values of the mixing parameters @xmath93 and @xmath95 . from these figures",
    ", we can see that the contributions of the @xmath0 simple group model to single top production are larger than those of the lh model . for the lh model ,",
    "the absolute values of the relative correction @xmath106 are smaller than @xmath107 in most of the parameter space preferred by the electroweak precision data .",

    "the production cross sections at hadron colliders for the t - channel and s - channel single top production processes have been calculated at the next leading order(nlo)[15,2 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath115 $ ] and @xmath116 $ ] at the lhc are given as @xmath117 $ ] and @xmath118 $ ] , respectively .",
    "a nlo calculation of the @xmath17 associated production cross section at the lhc has been recently given in ref.[16 ] .",
    "the large backgrounds of the signature from single top production come from w@xmath119jets and @xmath20 production . despite the relatively large expected rate and @xmath120",
    "has developed several advanced multivariate techniques to discriminate single top production from backgrounds[17 ] , single top production has not been discovered yet . for all of three processes for single top production , the production cross section of the t - channel process can be mostly precise measured at the lhc , which is expected to be measured to @xmath107 accuracy[4 ] .",
    "thus , at least we can say that , in most of the parameter space , the effects of the @xmath0 simple group model on the t - channel single top production process might be detected at the lhc .    in general , the contributions of the little higgs models to observables are proportional to the factor @xmath121 .",
    "to see the @xmath92 dependence of the corrections of the @xmath0 simple group model to single top production , we plot the relative correction @xmath106 as a function of the scale parameter @xmath92 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 in fig.3 , in which the solid line , dotted line , and dashed line represent the s - channel , t - channel , and @xmath124 associated production processes , respectively .",
    "one can see from fig.3 that the value of the relative correction @xmath106 gets close to zero as @xmath92 increasing .",
    "thus , the contributions of the @xmath0 simple group model to single top production decouple for large value of the scale parameter @xmath92 . however , for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , the absolute value of the relative correction @xmath128 is larger than @xmath107 , which might be detected at the lhc .",
    "some of the new particles , such as new charged gauge boson @xmath129 and scalar boson @xmath130 , can couple the top quark to one of the lighter sm particles and thus can generate contributions to single top production at tree - level or at one - loop .",
    "the one - loop contributions are generally too small to be observed at hadron colliders[18 ] . from eqs.(3,6,7 ) , we can see that the new charged gauge bosons @xmath1 and @xmath24 have contributions to the t - channel and s - channel processes for single top production .",
    "however , since these new gauge bosons must have space - like momentum in the t - channel process @xmath12 , their contributions to the production cross section of the t - channel process are suppressed by the factor @xmath131[19 ] .",
    "the masses @xmath132 and @xmath133 are at the order of tev .",

    "thus , the effects of the new gauge boson @xmath32 to the s - channel process for single top production might be detected at the lhc .",
    "the electroweak production of single top quark at hadron colliders is an important prediction of the sm which proceeds through three distinct subprocesses .",
    "these subprocesses are classified by the virtuality of the electroweak gauge boson @xmath9 involved : t - channel(@xmath10 ) , s - channel(@xmath176 ) , and associated @xmath17(@xmath177 ) production .",
    "each process has rather distinct event kinematics , and thus are potentially observable separately from each other[2 ] .",
    "all of these processes are sensitive to modification of the @xmath4 coupling and the s - channel process is rather sensitive to some heavy charged particles .",
    "thus , studying single top production at the lhc can help to text the sm and further to probe new physics beyond the sm .",
    "to solve the so - called hierarchy or fine - tuning problem of the sm , the little higgs theory was proposed as a kind of models to ewsb accomplished by a naturally light higgs boson .",
