    "many pulsars are observed to `` glitch '' , i.e. they show sudden increases in their spin frequency that are instantaneous to the accuracy of the data . to date several hundreds of glitches",
    "have been detected @xcite , with relative increases in the spin frequency @xmath0 that range from as low as @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "in particular a class of pulsars , of which the vela pulsar is the prototype , exhibit what are known as `` giant '' glitches @xcite , large steps in the spin frequency ( @xmath5 ) which are accompanied by an increase in the spindown rate @xmath6 and exhibit a rough periodicity in their recurrence rate ( for example giant glitches in the vela occur roughly every three years ) .",
    "shortly after the first glitches were observed it was suggested that they could be due to a superfluid component in the stellar interior , weakly coupled to the normal component and to the electromagnetic emission , that could store angular momentum and then release it catastrophically , giving rise to a glitch @xcite .",
    "large scale superfluid components are , in fact , expected in neutron star ( ns ) interiors on theoretical grounds given that the temperature of the star will drop below the superfluid critical temperature ( typically @xmath7 k ) soon after birth . furthermore recent observations of the cooling of the young ns in the supernova remnant cassiopeia a have provided the first direct indication of superfluidity in ns interiors @xcite .",
    "a superfluid rotates by forming an array of quantised vortices which carry the circulation of the fluid . in the ns crust",
    "the vortices can be strongly attracted , `` pinned '' , to the nuclear lattice @xcite and can not move outward .",
    "if the superfluid can not remove vortices it can not spin down and it therefore acts as an angular momentum reservoir . as the crust spins down due to electromagnetic emission a lag will develop between the superfluid and the normal component , leading to a hydrodynamical lift force ( magnus force ) acting on the vortices .",
    "eventually when the lag reaches a critical value the pinning force will no longer be able to contrast the hydrodynamical lift and the vortices will unpin , transferring their angular momentum to the crust and giving rise to a glitch .",
    "although there is some evidence that smaller glitches in young active pulsars such as the crab may be related to crust quakes @xcite , there is a growing consensus that the basic picture outlined above can be used to describe the main features of pulsar glitches .",
    "there is still considerable debate on the `` trigger '' for vortex unpinning and several mechanisms have been proposed ( including crust quakes @xcite , heat release @xcite and hydrodynamical instabilities @xcite ) , but recent work by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) has been very successful in using cellular automaton simulations that can track the movement of a large number of vortices , to reproduce the distribution of glitch sizes and waiting times , and @xcite have produced the first hydrodynamical simulation that can follow all stages of a giant glitch , from the rise to the relaxation .",
    "one of the main difficulties in performing such calculations , up to now , has been the relative scarcity of realistic estimates of the pinning force between vortices and nuclei in the crust .",
    "however the recent calculation of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) has filled this gap and produced physically consistent pinning profiles that can be used to study pulsar glitches .",
    "in fact @xcite has shown that these forces can be incorporated into a simple analytical model , the so - called `` snowplow '' model , that predicts the size , step in frequency derivative and waiting time of vela glitches .",
    "the same forces were used by @xcite in a hydrodynamical model to reproduce also the post - glitch relaxation of vela glitches and show that the model is consistent with the size and waiting times of other pulsars that exhibit giant glitches .",
    "we shall discuss the details of the snowplow model in the following sections , the main assumption , however , is that vortices close to the rotational axis of the star will only be weakly pinned at their extremities .",
    "the magnus force can thus easily unpin them and move them towards the equator , where they will repin as they are now immersed in the strong pinning region of the inner crust .",
    "this creates a vortex sheet that moves close to the maximum of the pinning potential as the star spins down .",
    "once the maximum critical lag is reached the pinning force can no longer balance the magnus force , and all the vorticity that has been accumulated is free to go , giving rise to a giant glitch .",
    "this also gives rise to a natural periodicity for giant glitches , although crust quakes or vortex avalanches can unpin part of the vorticity and give rise to smaller glitches before the maximum .    in this picture",
    "we implicitly assume that vortices that cross the core of the star are immersed in a low drag environment , i.e. that there is no pinning in the core and vortices are free to move out",
    ". this would not be the case if the protons in the interior are in a type ii superconducting state and there is a strong interaction between magnetic flux tubes and rotational vortices @xcite .",
    "note , however , that a large portion of the star may be in a type i superconducting state @xcite in which the magnetic field is not organised in flux tubes , but rather in macroscopic regions of normal matter , and the interactions may be much weaker @xcite ( although see @xcite for a discussion of strong interactions in type i superconductors ) .",
    "furthermore recent calculations suggest that even if the superconductivity is of type ii , the interaction between vortices and flux tubes will be weak in the presence of strong entrainment or superfluid @xmath8 hyperons @xcite . in this paper",
    "we thus take the view that pinning in the core will be weak , although strong pinning of vortices to flux tubes is an intriguing possibility and will be the focus of a future publication ( haskell , pizzochero & seveso , in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite developed the model for an @xmath9 polytrope in newtonian gravity , in order to obtain simple analytical estimates for the glitch size .",
    "in this paper we investigate the effect on the snowplow model of @xcite of using realistic equations of state ( eoss ) and relativistic equations for the stellar structure .",
    "we will see that in general the model is consistent with observations and that less massive nss ( in the region of @xmath10 ) are favoured to describe the vela pulsar .",
    "the inclusion of realistic backgrounds and equations of state in the hydrodynamical models will be the focus of future work .",
    "as outlined above the model proposed by @xcite relies on calculating the amount of vorticity that can be stored in the inner crust before the magnus force overcomes the maximum pinning force and then calculating the amount of angular momentum exchanged between the superfluid component and the crust . in order to obtain realistic estimates of the moment of inertia of the different components and of the strength of the density - dependent pinning force per unit length ,",
    "it is thus important to use a realistic equation of state ( eos ) for dense matter that describes the relation @xmath11 between density and pressure .",
    "the stellar structure and density profile can then be obtained by integration of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass contained in a sphere of radius @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the density profile and @xmath16 is the pressure .",
    "these differential equations model the hydrostatic equilibrium inside the star with relativistic approach and , of course , require the @xmath17 function .",
    "the last two equations can be combined in one that gives an expression for the mass and pressure derivatives and the system can be solved with valid initial conditions .",
    "we obtain the functions that describe the star with the fourth  order runge  kutta method , starting at @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for a valid choice of the central density @xmath21 .",
    "the integration stops when we reach the condition @xmath22 and we take @xmath23 as the radius of the star .",
    "of course the mass of the star is @xmath24 . as a result of this integration",
    "we have @xmath25 ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the star as showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tov ] .     neutron star for the eoss considered : with fixed mass , a stiffer eos produce a star with larger radius and lower central density . ]",
    "we use two different eoss :    1 .",
    "sly @xcite is a moderate eos , based on a non  relativistic parametrisation ; this equation describes the whole star with a single analytical expression and so it is more convenient to integrate ; 2",
    ".   gm1 by @xcite is a stiff @xmath11 relation that is very similar to sly in the crust of star , but not in the core due to different microscopic approach used to describe hadrons at densities higher than @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig : maxmass ] shows the different mass  central density relations for the two equations of state .     for each equation of state ( see table [ tab : maxmass ] ) .",
    "]    this figure clearly identifies also the presence of a limit for the mass for a neutron star .",
    "the existence of a maximum mass @xmath27 is an effect of the relativistic nature of the tov equations , where pressure contributes to the gravitational field .",
    "of course @xmath27 depends on the eos : a stiffer equation of state gives a higher @xmath27 .",
    "the evidence of the existence of a @xmath28 neutron star @xcite allows , in fact , to reject soft equations of state that predict a maximum mass below this value .",
    "table [ tab : maxmass ] shows the different values of @xmath27 for the equations of state considered .",
    ".this table shows , for each eos , the maximum allowed mass with the corresponding central density @xmath21 ( in units of nuclear saturation density @xmath26 ) , radius of the star @xmath23 , radius of the core @xmath29 and radius of the inner crust @xmath30 . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "one of the most important ingredients of the model is clearly @xmath31 , the pinning force per unit length that acts on the vortex line as a result of its interaction with the lattice ( in the inner crust ) .",
    "although the pinning force per pinning site can readily be evaluated from the knowledge of the pinning energy @xcite , the force per unit length of a vortex , which is the quantity that must be equated to the magnus force in order to understand whether a vortex is pinned or free , is much more complex to evaluate , as it depends on the rigidity of a vortex and on its orientation with respect to the crustal lattice .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) have performed numerical simulations to evaluate this quantity , taking into account different orientation of the bcc lattice .",
    "they found that the order of magnitude of the maximum pinning force @xmath32 is approximately @xmath33 and that there is no significant difference for the pinning force per unit length in considering vortex ",
    "nucleus interaction attractive or repulsive in different regions .",
    "another interesting result found by @xcite regards the position of the maximum @xmath32 . in this paper",
    "the authors use a density  dependent pairing gap @xmath34 obtained with a realistic microscopic nucleon  nucleon interaction .",
    "it is known that the polarization effects of the neutron medium reduce the paring gap , but there is yet no agreement on how strong this suppression will be , although it seems reasonable to divide the @xmath34 by a factor @xmath35 between 2 and 3 .",
    "@xcite consider the case @xmath36 and @xmath37 and find that for the two corresponding profiles @xmath31 the maximum is shifted at different densities , even if the parameter @xmath35 is , of course , only a scaling factor on the same pairing gap profile .",
    "the precise height of the maximum thus depends on the vortex tension used in the model ( although the order of magnitude remains @xmath33 ) and does not affect the location of the maximum ( once @xmath35 is fixed ) . in this work",
    "we therefore constrain the exact value of the maximum amplitude of the pinning force by fitting the average waiting time between giant glitches in the vela pulsar , as will be explained in the next sections . in figure",
    "[ fig : pinning ] we show the two pinning profiles @xmath31 used in this work for @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( plotted here with the choice of @xmath38 ) .     for the two cases @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with a choice for the maximum of @xmath38 . ]",
    "the case @xmath39 has a maximum at @xmath40 , while in the @xmath41 case the maximum is at @xmath42 . in both configurations",
    "we take the pinning force to vanish at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , due to the fact that the lattice exists only in the crust and that in the outer crust there are no free neutrons to produce vortices .",
    "a single vortex line will be described parallel to the rotational axis and distant from this axis by a distance @xmath45 , that represent the cylindrical radius .",
    "we consider also the vortex line to be continuous throughout the core : there is , in fact , no theoretical evidence for the existence of an interface of normal matter between the core and the inner crust , that can justify the hypothesis of a core with vorticity separated from the crust @xcite .",
    "naturally the vortices may not be straight and parallel to the rotational axis , as turbulence may develop in the stellar interior , especially in the presence of strong pinning @xcite .",
    "we will not consider this possibility here , but will discuss some of its likely consequences in the following .    with the above hypothesis",
    ", we can identify two ( cylindrical ) pinning regions based on the strength of the pinning interaction .",
    "the _ strong _ pinning region is defined by @xmath46 and corresponds to the part of the star in which the vortices lie entirely in the inner crust region , and are therefore subject to pinning for their whole length .",
    "on the other hand , in the _ weak _ pinning region ( @xmath47 ) , a vortex line is pinned only at its extremities that are immersed in the crust , while there is no pinning interaction in the core ( see figure [ fig : schema ] ) .",
    "thanks to the axial symmetry of the problem , we can describe the macroscopic quantities of the rotating superfluid in terms of the variable @xmath48 that represents the number of vortices per unit area , at a distance @xmath45 from the rotational axis of the star .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath49 of the superfluid component of the star is in fact proportional to the number @xmath50 of vortices enclosed in a cylindrical region of cylindrical radius @xmath45 , and can be expressed as : @xmath51 where the integration is performed on the area enclosed by the radius @xmath45 .",
    "this result follows from the quantization of the circulation per vortex line that is encoded in the constant @xmath52 .    once a star has been fixed by the choice of an eos and the integration of the tov equations , the model requires , as a first step , the evaluation of the pinning force for the whole length of a generic vortex line .",
    "this can be obtained starting from the function @xmath31 discussed previously .",
    "let us imagine a vortex line parallel to the rotational axis of the star and distant @xmath45 : the total pinning acting on it is given by the integration of @xmath31 over its length : @xmath53 \\ , dz\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the length of the vortex line , obtained considering that the vortex line ends at the inner  outer crust surface . to understand better the role of the pinning force , we choose a neutron star of @xmath55 with sly equation of state and we plot the function @xmath56 for @xmath45 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : totalpinning ] , corresponding to @xmath36 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "integrated on the whole length of a vortex line distant @xmath45 from the rotational axis of the star .",
    "this plot is obtained taking a star of @xmath55 and sly eos .",
    "the pinning profile used is the @xmath36 case plotted in figure [ fig : pinning ] . ]",
    "the pinning interaction is not the only force that acts on a vortex line . as shown in @xcite",
    ", pinning prevents the vortex line from moving with the local superfluid velocity because the vortex line is compelled to have the velocity of the normal matter component ( the normal component rotates as a rigid body with angular velocity @xmath59 ) .",
    "this fact give rise to a magnus force : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the velocity of the vortex line and @xmath62 is the superfluid velocity ; here @xmath63 must be intended as force per unit length .    in this expression @xmath64 is the density of the superfluid fraction of the star .",
    "in fact the whole star can be divided in two components : the normal one ( which includes also the protons in the core as they are coupled with the crust by the magnetic field ) and the superfluid one , on which the magnus force will act .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the proton fraction at a given density .",
    "of course this quantity is a microphysical property of matter and for this reason is strictly dependent on the eos used . as this information",
    "is not provided with the eoss used , we use the results of @xcite who give the proton fraction @xmath67 as a function of the total density in the case of two  body interactions and also in the case of three - body forces .",
    "we use both the @xmath67 relations of @xcite but we consider also a third case where the proton fraction is a constant that does not depend on the total density .",
    "we also introduce the parameter @xmath68 that represent the superfluid fraction of the star .",
    "it is defined for the general case as @xmath69 where we have used eq .",
    "[ eq : inertia ] ; @xmath70 is the total moment of inertia and @xmath71 is the moment of inertia of the superfluid component . in the case of a constant proton fraction",
    "it then follows that @xmath72 .",
    "the average value is @xmath73 and therefore we shall test our model also with this prescription .",
    "the magnus force in [ eq : magnus ] has only one component in the radial direction ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 are , in fact , directed along @xmath74 , so the cross product is directed along @xmath75 ) and therefore can be rewritten as : @xmath76 where the difference of the two velocities is written as @xmath77 $ ] and depends only on the coordinate @xmath45 , as described by equation [ eq : os ] .",
    "this quantity is negative between two glitches because the normal component spins slower that the superfluid one ; indeed the magnus force is a hydrodynamical lift that pushes the vortex outward from the rotational axis .",
    "the key point here is the fact that the normal component spins down as a consequence of the loss of energy by electromagnetic radiation of the star : the result is an increase of @xmath78 in the time interval between glitches .",
    "the same integration performed with @xmath79 over the length of the vortex can be done with the magnus force .",
    "we can consider the total magnus force acting on a vortex line distant @xmath45 from the rotational axis : @xmath80    the basic idea here is to compare the pinning force and the magnus force to find the critical lag @xmath81 that represents the depinning condition : when the actual lag between the two components of the stars reaches the value @xmath82 at some point with cylindrical radius @xmath45 , the vortices here are unbound from the lattice , as the magnus force now exceeds the pinning interaction that held the vortices in place : @xmath83 here @xmath84 and it is plotted in fig . [ fig : magnus ] using the same reference star as in fig .",
    "[ fig : totalpinning ] .     as a function of the cylindrical radius @xmath45 .",
    "this plot is obtained taking a star of @xmath55 and sly eos . ]    the important quantity is therefore the critical lag that can be easily evaluated as : @xmath85 \\",
    ", dz}{\\kappa x   \\int_0^{\\ell(x)/2 } \\rho_s \\left(\\sqrt{x^2 + z^2 } \\right ) \\ , dz}.\\ ] ]    in figure [ fig : criticallag ] we plot the critical lag for sample stars from table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "it is important to point out that the critical lag shows a peak @xmath86 in a region that corresponds to the inner crust , that is the region where the pinning is stronger . in this region",
    "our estimate of @xmath81 is reasonable since pinning is continuous along the whole single vortex .",
    "this is not the case for the critical lag in the core , because here pinning acts on vortices only at their extremities : as explained by @xcite this fact is responsible of the _ weak _ pinning in this region , even though we can assume that the system maintains axial symmetry due to the collective rigidity of vortex bundles @xcite .",
    "as the star slows down , the depinning condition @xmath87 is first reached in the _ core _ : as shown by @xcite , in this region repinning is dynamically possible if the lag falls below a critical value ( smaller than the one for depinning ) .",
    "this suggest the following interpretation : in the _ core _ , as the star slows down , the vortices are continuously depinned and repinned , establishing a dynamical creep that removes the excess vorticity on short timescales .",
    "furthermore the magnus force in the interior is likely to overcome the tension of vortices and depin them long before the unpinning condition in the crust is met @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is thus that vortices in the core can essentially be considered free . in this region",
    "the scattering of electrons off magnetised vortex cores is mainly responsible for the drag forces and for the short relaxation timescale @xmath88 @xcite : this means that we can consider the normal and the superfluid components in the core as coupled with a lag of order @xmath89 .    in the time between glitches ,",
    "the depinning region becomes larger , involving also the crust : in the inner crust the excess vorticity is repinned and creates a thin vortex sheet that moves toward the peak : this sheet is pushed outward by the increasing magnus force and it stores angular momentum . when the peak is reached , there is no more pinning interaction that can block the excess vorticity : this vorticity is suddenly released and reaches the outer crust . at this moment the angular momentum stored by vortices is transferred to the normal component of the star , and this causes the glitch .",
    "it is straightforward now to evaluate the time interval between two glitches : this is given by the time needed to create a lag @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the deceleration of the normal component referred to the pre ",
    "glitch steady  state condition .",
    "the above arguments indicates that , immediately before a glitch , a lag of @xmath90 will have been created for @xmath93 .",
    "this means that we can use equation [ eq : os ] to express the number of vortices stored at the peak in the sheet just before a glitch : @xmath94 due to the particular shape of the critical lag in figure [ fig : criticallag ] , we can assume that in this moment the excess vorticity in the region @xmath95 has been entirely removed by the magnus force , and therefore the @xmath96 vortices are the only ones responsible for the transfer of angular momentum to the normal component of the star . to evaluate the angular momentum transfer we start from the definition @xmath97 .",
    "as we are interested in the angular momentum stored by @xmath96 vortices at the peak of the pinning potential , we use the relation in [ eq : nv ] and perform the integration on the cylindrical region @xmath98 to obtain the requested quantity ( the integration on the coordinate @xmath45 stops at @xmath29 due to the fact that in the outer crust there is no superfluid component ) : @xmath99    following the arguments above , at the moment of a glitch only a fraction of the core superfluidity is coupled to the normal component of the star : in fact , the rise time of a glitch ( @xmath100 ) is very short and only the instantaneously depinned fraction of vorticity in the core can respond to the variation of the angular velocity of the crust .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath101 to encode this fractional quantity .",
    "in fact the best observational upper limit is of @xmath102 for the vela 2000 glitch @xcite , while an interesting lower limit of @xmath103 ms can be set by the non  detection of gravitational waves from the vela 2006 glitch @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates suggest that @xmath104 s @xcite .    in the pre ",
    "glitch steady  state condition , due to the long timescales involved , we can assume @xmath105 ; but during a glitch this quantity can not be calculated with the snowplow model as it depends on the detailed short ",
    "time dynamics of the vortices , and must thus be determined with hydrodynamical simulations such as those in @xcite . as this is beyond the scope of the current paper , the quantity @xmath101 is taken as a parameter of this model , and must be inferred from the observational data as shown in the next section .    the value @xmath101 is needed for the evaluation of @xmath106 , the jump in angular velocity of the normal component of the star due to a glitch .",

    "in this section we test the model proposed here against observations .",
    "as the model has been developed for giant glitches we shall compare our results to observations of giant glitches in the vela pulsar .",
    "the vela ( psr b0833 - 45 or psr j0835 - 4510 ) has a spin frequency @xmath122 hz and spin - down rate @xmath123 hz s@xmath124 ; from relation [ eq : tgl ] this value correspond to a maximum critical lag of @xmath125 , where we have considered that the average time between glitches for this pulsar is @xmath126 years . the glitch is usually described in terms of permanent steps in the frequency and frequency derivative and a series of transient terms that decay exponentially .",
    "it is well known that at least three transient terms are required , with decay timescales that range from months to hours @xcite .",
    "recent observations of the 2000 and 2004 glitch have shown that an additional term is required on short timescales , with a decay time of approximately a minute . given that the detection in 2004 was only barely above the noise we shall refer to the january 2000 glitch . in this case",
    "the jump in angular velocity was of @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "this is a fairly typical value for giant glitches in the vela , and we take it as our reference value .",
    "the relative step in frequency derivative corresponding to the transient term with the shortest decay timescale ( 1 minute ) for this glitch is @xmath128 ( 1@xmath129 error ) , and we assume that this is a good approximation to the _ instantaneous _ step in frequency derivative at the time of the glitch .    as explained in the previous section , the model has two free parameters that are the maximum value of the pinning force value @xmath32 and @xmath101 : this means that , once a star has been fixed ( by choosing the eos , the mass @xmath112 , and the superfluid fraction relation ) we can use two observational quantities to constrain the parameters of the model and compare further observables to the quantities predicted by calculations .",
    "in particular , for each fixed star , we rescale the maximum of the pinning force in order to produce the maximum critical lag @xmath90 required to reproduce the average waiting time between glitches in the vela .",
    "this allows us to calculate directly and univocally the angular momentum @xmath107 from equation [ eq : dlg ] .",
    "as we want to reproduce a glitch of amplitude @xmath127 , relation [ eq : dogl ] can be rewritten in the following form @xmath130,\\ ] ] and therefore can be used to fix the coupled fraction of matter during the glitch .",
    "tables [ tab : a095 ] , [ tab : azu1 ] and [ tab : azu2 ] give the fitting parameters for all the configurations tested .",
    "we can see that the value of the maximum pinning force @xmath32 does not change significantly with the total mass of the star . in these tables",
    "negative values of @xmath101 are not given as they would not be physically acceptable : a negative value would mean that there is not enough angular momentum to produce the required jump in angular velocity , even if we consider the core vorticity completely decoupled from the normal component of the star at the time of the glitch .",
    "the remaining tables , numbered [ tab : b095 ] , [ tab : bzu1 ] and [ tab : bzu2 ] , show the physical quantities that the `` snowplow '' model permits to evaluate .",
    "these are of course the angular momentum @xmath107 transferred to the crust during the glitch and the relative step in frequency derivative .",
    "we can see that the order of magnitude for @xmath107 is @xmath131 , that is compatible with the upper limits on the glitch energy obtained from observations of the power wind nebula surrounding vela @xcite and with the results found in @xcite , where the same model is applied analytically with a polytropic eos in newtonian gravity . from these tables",
    "one can see that , for a particular choice of eos and proton fraction , the angular momentum @xmath107 stored by vortices decreases with the total mass of the star .",
    "this behaviour can be easily explained , as shown by @xcite , in terms of the quantity @xmath132 shown in the tables : @xmath107 is obviously related to the number @xmath96 of vortices stored at the peak ( in tables [ tab : b095 ] , [ tab : bzu1 ] and [ tab : bzu2 ] ; see also eq .",
    "[ eq : dlg ] )  that however does nt change significantly with the mass  but it depends strongly on the ratio @xmath132 which increases at higher masses . in @xcite",
    "4 ) it is clearly shown that the angular momentum stored by the vortices at the peak decreases rapidly moving the position of the peak towards the outer crust .",
    "the quantity @xmath107 also depends on the equation of state used ( a stiffer eos produces higher values of @xmath107 ) and on the pinning profile : the @xmath133 condition , when other variables are fixed , gives lower values for the angular momentum , accordingly to the fact that the relative position of the peak with respect to the inner crust radius is higher .",
    "the `` snowplow '' model permits to calculate also the step in spin  down rate immediately after a glitch , and this quantity is given in our tables as @xmath119 .",
    "it has been calculated only for acceptable values of @xmath101 , and must be compared with the reference value of @xmath134 , taken from the vela 2000 glitch @xcite .",
    "these values suggest that the @xmath37 configurations are preferred and this can be considered in reasonable agreement with the microscopic results found by @xcite : they find that a realistic suppression factor for the pairing gap @xmath34 is @xmath135 but , crucially , also that the maximum for @xmath34 is shifted at lower densities .",
    "this leads to a profile close to what we obtain for @xmath136 in our model .",
    "finally let us remark that the results in tables [ tab : b095 ] , [ tab : bzu1 ] and [ tab : bzu2 ] , for the ( microscopically favoured ) case @xmath136 , seem to indicate that a stiffer equation of state ( gm1 ) is preferred as is a lower mass ( possibly in the region of @xmath137 ) for the vela pulsar .",
    "naturally such a quantitative conclusion is difficult to make on the basis of one observation and it would be highly desirable to have information on the short - timescale post - glitch behaviour not only of other vela giant glitches , but also of other glitching pulsars . note that short term components of the relaxation have not been measured for other giant glitchers , however the `` snowplow '' model can be used to predict waiting times , obtaining results which are consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have extended the `` snowplow '' model for giant pulsar glitches of @xcite to incorporate relativistic background stellar models and realistic equations of state .",
    "in particular we test the model for the sly and gm1 equations of state .",
    "unfortunately these equations of state do not include information on beta equilibrium , so we use the proton fractions calculated by @xcite .",
    "it would of course be highly desirable to use proton fractions that are consistent with the individual equations of state in future work , in order to set stringent constraints .",
    "furthermore we use , for the first time , the realistic profiles for the pinning forces per unit length calculated by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in order to evaluate the amount of angular momentum that can be transferred to the crust during a glitch .",
    "the model contains three free parameters , the mass of the star @xmath112 , the fraction of superfluid that is coupled to the crust during a glitch @xmath138 , ( which can only be estimated with dynamical simulations such as those of @xcite ) , and the maximum amplitude of the pinning force , @xmath32 .",
    "note in fact that while the location of the maximum is precisely determined by the microphysical calculations of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the actual value of the maximum can vary by factors of order unity or more as it depends on the poorly constrained value of the vortex tension .",
    "we thus treat it as a normalization and determine its value by requiring that the waiting time between glitches is of 2.8 years , as is approximately the case for vela glitches .",
    "we then fit the size of the glitch to an average vela glitch to obtain the value of @xmath138 .",
    "in particular we take the value of the vela 2000 glitch , @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "having determined the free parameters in our model , except for the mass of the ns which is free , we compare our results to the post glitch step in frequency derivative .",
    "unfortunately the changes in @xmath6 on short time scales after a glitch are observationally challenging to detect and it has been possible to fit for transient steps in frequency and frequency derivative on timescales of minutes after a glitch only for the vela 2000 and 2004 glitch @xcite .",
    "given that the detection is only barely above the noise for the 2004 glitch @xcite we fit to the values obtained for the 2000 glitch , which we assume to be a good approximation of the instantaneous post glitch behaviour .",
    "this justifies our choice of also fitting to the value of the jump in frequency of the vela 2000 glitch .",
    "the comparison of the model to the observational constraints first of all highlights that the general results of the analytic model of @xcite remain valid even in our more physically realistic approach and the results are in general consistent for both equations of state for a reasonable range of neutron star masses .",
    "the glitch model presented here thus appears robust and compatible with the observations of giant glitches in the vela and is , as shown in @xcite , compatible with the average waiting time between giant glitches in other pulsars .",
    "this further reinforces the hypothesis that giant glitches are approximately periodic phenomena that occur close to the maximum lag that the pinning force can support in the crust , while smaller glitches may be triggered by random events such as crust quakes @xcite or vortex avalanches @xcite .",
    "furthermore our results favour lower masses for the vela pulsar ( smaller than @xmath140 ) and stiffer equations of state .",
    "note however that such a quantitative conclusion is difficult to draw as not only are we comparing to a single observation but dynamical simulations have also shown that superfluid mutual friction will contribute significantly to the short term post - glitch spindown @xcite as may friction at the crust / core interface @xcite . in",
    "will thus be necessary to further develop hydrodynamical glitch simulations to truly constrain the equation of state and the stellar mass .",
    "finally let us remark that in this paper we have assumed straight vortices that cross cross the core of the neutron star and are only weakly pinned at their extremities .",
    "although the assumption of vortices that pass through the star appears to be justified by microphysical estimates , that do not predict an interface of normal matter between the crust and core superfluid @xcite , it may be the case that if the protons in the core are in a type ii superconducting state this could lead to strong pinning also in the stellar interior @xcite . in this case",
    "not only would vortex motion be impeded , but it is also likely that turbulence will develop @xcite",
    ". note , however , that a large portion of the star may be in a type i superconducting state @xcite in which the magnetic field is not organised in flux tubes , but rather in macroscopic regions of normal matter , and the interactions may be much weaker @xcite ( although see @xcite for a discussion of pinning in type i superconductors ) . furthermore @xcite has recently shown that in the presence of strong entrainment or superfluid @xmath8 hyperons , the interaction between vortices and flux tubes may be much weaker than generally assumed in the presence of type ii superconductivity . in this paper",
    "we thus take the view that pinning in the core will be weak , although strong pinning of vortices to flux tubes is an intriguing possibility and will be the focus of a future publication ( haskell , pizzochero & seveso , in preparation ) .",
    "turbulence , on the other hand , is well known from laboratory superfluids and may play an important role in pulsar glitches @xcite and could couple the superfluid and the normal component on inter - glitch timescales in the presence of core pinning @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of turbulence in a hydrodynamical glitch simulations is , however , a complex matter as not only is the nature of the turbulence not known ( see e.g. @xcite ) but also the definition of pinning force per unit length must be revisited in the presence of a turbulent tangle .",
    "such a fundamental issue should clearly be the focus of future work .",
