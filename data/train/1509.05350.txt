    "during the past few years , methods for direct laser slowing and cooling of small molecules have progressed remarkably , advancing from a demonstration of modest forces in 2009 all the way to a full realization of magneto - optical trapping at ultracold temperatures @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all - optical slowing and cooling is presently applicable only to a small number of molecules , and the present schemes require complex optical configurations with multiple repumping beams to recycle atoms that are lost by unwanted radiative decay into distant  dark \" states . in 2011",
    "we proposed that the coherent optical bichromatic force could improve greatly on this situation , by providing not only a much stronger force , but one that allows much greater momentum transfer prior to radiative loss into non - cycling dark states @xcite .",
    "our 2011 paper relied largely on semi - quantitative arguments based on a two - level model , admittedly not fully adequate to describe the multilevel manifolds inevitably encountered in real molecules . here",
    "we verify and greatly extend this treatment by describing detailed numerical modeling of the bichromatic force ( bcf ) in realistic multilevel systems .",
    "the bichromatic force in two - level systems has successfully been demonstrated in several atoms and is amply described in prior publications @xcite . in brief , the bcf is the coherent force produced by a balanced counterpropagating pair of two - color cw laser beams . each two - color beam can be regarded as a beat note train produced by beams with frequencies @xmath1 , for a carrier frequency @xmath2 centered close to the two - level resonant frequency . if the laser power is adjusted so that each beat is approximately a @xmath3-pulse , and if the counterpropagating beat notes are sequenced properly , a large net force is produced by alternating cycles of coherent excitation and stimulated emission .",
    "larger bichromatic detunings @xmath4 produce a faster beat note period and thus a larger force , at the cost of a laser power requirement that scales as @xmath5 . in practice detunings of 100 - 400 times the radiative decay lifetime are workable , producing average forces larger than the radiative force by a similar multiple .",
    "the velocity range of the force is also superior to the radiative force , extending over a range of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wave vector for the transition of interest .",
    "recent developments in diode laser technology and rf electronics have made it relatively easy to produce the multi - frequency beams required for the bcf .    in a molecule",
    "the maximum attainable velocity reduction will usually be limited not by the velocity range of the force , but instead by unwanted radiative decay to non - cycling dark states , typically vibrational or rotational levels that are addressed neither by the bcf laser nor by added repumping lasers  @xcite .",
    "thus there is a dual motivation for using stimulated optical forces when working with molecules : to enhance the average force and more importantly , to increase the number of optical cycles that occur before the molecule is lost into an inaccessible vibrational or rotational level .    in a multi - level system like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : multilevel ] , it is impossible to achieve a @xmath3 pulse for every component of a transition , even for a stationary molecule with an optimal laser pulse .",
    "thus the optimal laser power and detuning involve unavoidable compromises , and the force is an average over the effects of several concurrently cyling transitions , some of them coupled coherently . in our 2011 paper we treated this problem phenomenologically for the caf molecule @xcite , an approach repeated more recently for mgf by dai and coworkers @xcite . by contrast , in this paper we describe detailed numerical calculations that fully incorporate multilevel coherence , optical pumping , and the effects of repumping lasers that can optionally be used to repopulate the cycling system from dark states .",

    "there is no direct coupling or decay between the @xmath12 and @xmath14 states .",
    "levels are labeled by their characteristic frequencies . ]    in section [ sec : theory ] we describe the theoretical approach used to numerically solve for the time - dependent density matrix of a multilevel system in a pair of bichromatic laser fields in the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "direct numerical integration has proven to be surprisingly stable and rapidly convergent , and we have successfully treated systems with up to 16 levels .",
    "we start by treating three - level lambda - type systems in section [ sec : twoplusone ] , then introduce the effects of dark - state repumping from distant dark states in section [ sec : repumping ] . in section [ sec : dark_destabilization ]",
    "we consider the additional complication of intra - system dark states , which can arise in many - level systems with high ground - state multiplicity .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : caf ] we consider in detail the feasibility of bichromatic slowing for the caf molecule , a species of considerable current interest for laser slowing and cooling @xcite .",
    "we treat the caf problem using both full 16-level simulations for the @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 branch and a more approximate approach , in which the system is simplified by dividing it into several subsystems that are assumed to cycle nearly independently .",
    "we show that the subsystem - based modeling yields results very similar to the exact treatment in most cases , supporting the use of similar simplifications for treating the bichromatic force in other molecular systems . more generally , the results verify the predictions of the semi - quantitative reasoning in our 2011 paper indicating that bcf slowing of molecular beams shows great promise .",
    "in our modeling of multilevel systems , we assume illumination by a pair of counterpropagating two - frequency laser beams that provide equal electric field magnitudes in all four components . in each beam the two frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 produce a train of beat notes , as described above .",

    "a least - squares fits gives the constant of proportionality as @xmath117 .",
    "this is just slightly greater than 1/3 of the ideal two - level proportionality of @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "an example of level mixing in a much more complicated system is given in section [ subsec : cafsim ] , where a detailed 16-level simulation is carried out for the bichromatic force on a molecular beam of caf .",
    "an alternative method for destabilizing dark states is to dynamically switch the polarization of the driving fields , thereby dynamically switching which state is dark .",

    "instead , we simulate a simple on - off modulation pattern in which each polarization is kept on for a time @xmath133 before switching to the other polarization .    during each step in this",
    "cycle , population will gradually be optically pumped into the two dark @xmath100 states that can not be re - excited , diminishing the force commensurately . each switch in polarization constitutes a rephasing of the system after which coherence on the new transition ( and thus the optical force ) will gradually begin building up .",
    "an optimal switching period is therefore expected that balances these two effects .    the initial phase of the bichromatic optical field influences how quickly an incoherent population equilibrates under bichromatic driving . in most of our simulations",
    ", this phase is set to @xmath134 , which gives the quickest equilibration , and the transient behavior is allowed to die away before evaluating the force .",
