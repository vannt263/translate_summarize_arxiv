    "risk measures are used to quantify insurance losses and financial assessments .",
    "several risk measures have been proposed in actuarial science literature , namely : the value - at - risk ( var ) , the expected shortfall or the conditional tail expectation ( cte ) , and the distorted risk measures ( drm ) . before introducing and interpreting the drm ,",
    "it is necessary to fix a convention of profit and loss appropriate to the application to the market finance , the credit risk and to the insurance .",
    "let @xmath0 be a random variable ( rv ) , representing losses ( or gains ) of a company , with a continuous distribution function ( df ) @xmath1 the drm of rv @xmath2 due to wang @xcite , is defined as follows : @xmath3:=\\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\psi ( 1-f(x))dx ,   \\label{eq5.1}\\]]where @xmath4 is a non - decreasing function , called distortion function , satisfying @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the actuarial literature the following functions are frequently used:@xmath7where @xmath8 is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution @xmath9 constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 are called distortion parameters . the functions @xmath12",
    "@xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively give rise to the so - called proportional hazard transform ( pht ) ( wang wan95 ) , the normal transform ( wang @xcite ) , the cte and the look - back distortion ( hrlimann @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath16 and @xmath17 there is no distortion and the corresponding drm is equal to the expectation of @xmath18 for recent literature on risk measures one refers to denuit _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and furman and zitikis ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of the axiomatic foundation of risk measures has received much attention starting with the seminal paper of artzner _",
    "@xcite , where the definition of coherent risk measure was first provided .",
    "a coherent risk measure is a real functional @xmath19 defined on a space of rv s , satisfying the following axioms :    * h1 .",
    "* boundedness from above by the maximum loss : @xmath20    * h2 .",
    "* boundedness from below by the mean loss : @xmath21    * h3 . * scalar additivity and multiplicativity : @xmath22 for @xmath23    * h4 . *",
    "subadditivity : @xmath24    the only axiom that a drm may lack in order to be a coherent risk measure in the sense of artzner _",
    "@xcite is h4 .",
    "however , the subadditivity theorem of choquet integrals ( denneberg @xcite ) guarantees that @xmath25 if and only if the distortion function @xmath26 is concave .",
    "hence , the drm @xmath27 $ ] defined in @xmath28 with a concave distortion @xmath26 is coherent .",
    "it is well known that the cte and the pht are examples of concave distortion risk measures , whereas the var is not . in traditional risk theory ,",
    "individual risks have been usually assumed to be independent .",
    "traceability for this assumption is very convenient , but not realistic .",
    "recently in the actuarial science , the study of the impact of dependence among risks has become a major and flourishing topic .",
    "several notions of dependence were introduced to model the fact that larger values of one component of a multivariate risk tend to be associated with larger values of the others . in this paper",
    ", we deal with a vector of risk losses @xmath29 @xmath30 and we discuss the computation of the drm of the sum @xmath31 of its components .",
    "when @xmath32 are independent and identically distributed , their sum is considered as a rv whose df @xmath33 is the convolution of the marginal distributions of @xmath34 in this case , the drm value of @xmath35 for a given distortion function @xmath36 may be obtained via formula @xmath37 that is@xmath38 : = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\psi ( 1-g ( z ) ) dz .",
    "\\label{eq5.2}\\ ] ]    now , assume that @xmath32 are dependent with joint df @xmath39 and continuous margins @xmath40 @xmath41 in this case , the problem becomes different and its resolution requires more than the usual background .",
    "several authors discussed the drm , when applied to sums of rv s , against some classical dependency measures such as person s @xmath42 spearman s @xmath43 and kendall s @xmath44 see for instance , darkiewicz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and burgert and rschendorf @xcite .",
    "our contribution is to introduce the copula notion to provide more flexibility to the drm of sums of rv s in terms of loss and dependence structure . for comprehensive details on copulas",
    "one may consult the textbook of nelsen @xcite . according to sklar s theorem ( sklar @xcite ) , there exists a unique copula @xmath45 ^{d } \\rightarrow [ 0,1 ] $ ] such that@xmath46    the copula @xmath47 is the joint df of rv s",
    "@xmath48 @xmath41 it is defined on @xmath49 ^{d}$ ] by @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the quantile function of @xmath52 this means that the drm of the sum is a functional of both copula @xmath47 and margins @xmath52 therefore , one must take into account the dependence structure and the behavior of margin tails .",
    "these two aspects have an important influence when quantifying risks .",
    "if the correlation factor is neglected , the calculation of the drm follows formula @xmath53 which only focuses on distorting the tail . in order to highlight the dependence structure ,",
    "we add a distortion on the copula as well .",
    "the notion of distorted copula has recently been considered by several authors , see for instance frees and valdez @xcite , genest and rivest @xcite , morillas @xcite , crane and van der hoek @xcite and valdez and xiao @xcite .",
