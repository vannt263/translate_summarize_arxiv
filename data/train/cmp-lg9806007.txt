    "transformation - based learning is a relatively new machine learning method , which has been as effective as any other approach on the part - of - speech tagging problem  ( brill , 1995a ) .",
    "we are utilizing transformation - based learning for another important language task called dialogue act tagging , in which the goal is to label each utterance in a conversational dialogue with the proper dialogue act .",
    "dialogue act _ is a concise abstraction of a speaker s intention , such as suggest or accept . recognizing dialogue acts is critical for discourse - level understanding and can also be useful for other applications , such as resolving ambiguity in speech recognition . but computing dialogue acts is a challenging task , because often a dialogue act can not be directly inferred from a literal reading of an utterance .",
    "figure  [ ex - das ] presents a hypothetical dialogue that has been labeled with dialogue acts .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a preliminary experiment we ran ten trials with five committee members , testing on held - out data .",
    "figure  [ confidences ] presents average scores and standard deviations , varying the minimum confidence , * m*. for a given instance , if at least * m * committee members agreed on a tag , then the most popular tag was applied , breaking ties in favor of the committee member that was developed the earliest ; otherwise no tag was output .",
    "the results show that the committee approach assigns useful confidence measures to the tags : all five committee members agreed on the tags for 45.12% of the instances , and 90.09% of those tags were correct .",
    "also , for 69.79% of the instances , at least four of the five committee members selected the same tag , and this tag was correct 83.53% of the time .",
    "we foresee that our module for tagging dialogue acts can potentially be integrated into a larger system so that , when transformation - based learning can not produce a tag with high confidence , other modules may be invoked to provide more evidence . in addition , like boosting , the committee method improves the overall accuracy of the system . by selecting the most popular tag among all five committee members , the average accuracy in tagging unseen data was 73.45% , while using the first committee member alone resulted in a significantly ( @xmath0 ) lower average score of 70.79% .",
    "previously , the best success rate achieved on the dialogue act tagging problem was reported by reithinger and klesen  ( 1997 ) , whose system used a probabilistic machine learning approach based on n - grams to correctly label 74.7% of the utterances in a test corpus .",
    "( see samuel , carberry , and vijay - shanker  ( 1998a ) for a more extensive analysis of previous work on this task . ) as a direct comparison , we applied our system to exactly the same training and testing set . over five runs ,",
    "the system achieved an average accuracy of 75.12%@xmath11.34% , including a high score were produced in this experiment .",
    "] of 77.44% .",
    "in addition , we ran a direct comparison between transformation - based learning and c5.0  ( rulequest research , 1998 ) , which is an implementation of the decision trees method .",
    "the accuracies on held - out data for training sets of various sizes are presented in figure  [ accuracy - graph ] . for transformation - based learning",
    ", we averaged the scores of ten trials for each training set ( to factor out the random effects of the monte carlo method ) , and the standard deviations are represented by error bars in the graph .",
    "these experiments did not utilize the committee method , and we would expect the scores to improve when this extension is used .    with c5.0 , we wanted to use the same features that were effective for transformation - based learning , but we encountered two problems : 1 )  since c5.0 requires that each feature take exactly one value for each instance , it is very difficult to utilize the cue patterns feature .",
    "we decided to provide one boolean feature for each possible cue pattern , which was set to true for instances that included that cue pattern and false otherwise .",
    "2 )  our transformation - based learning system utilized the system - generated tag of the preceding instance .",
    "c5.0 can not use this information , as it requires that the values of all of the features are computed before training begins .",
    "the training times of transformation - based learning and c5.0 were relatively comparable for any number of conditions , although boosting sometimes resulted in a significant increase in training time .",
    "the accuracy scores of transformation - based learning and c5.0 , with and without boosting , are not significantly different , as shown in figure  [ accuracy - graph ] .",
    "this paper has described the first investigation of transformation - based learning applied to discourse - level problems .",
    "we extended the algorithm to address two limitations of transformation - based learning : 1 )  we developed a monte carlo version of transformation - based learning , and our experiments suggest that this improvement dramatically increases the efficiency of the method without compromising accuracy .",
    "this revision enables transformation - based learning to work effectively on a wider variety of tasks , including tasks where the relevant conditions and condition combinations are not known in advance as well as tasks where there are a large number of relevant conditions and condition combinations .",
    "this improvement also decreases the labor demands on the human developer , who no longer needs to construct a minimal set of rule templates .",
    "it is sufficient to list all of the conditions that might be relevant and allow the system to consider all possible combinations of those conditions .",
    "2 )  we devised a committee strategy for computing confidence measures to represent the reliability of tags . in our experiments , this committee method improved the overall tagging accuracy significantly .",
    "it also produced useful confidence measures ; nearly half of the tags were assigned high confidence , and of these , 90% were correct .    for the dialogue act tagging task",
    ", our modified version of transformation - based learning has achieved an accuracy rate that is comparable to any previously reported system .",
    "in addition , transformation - based learning has a number of features that make it particularly appealing for the dialogue act tagging task :    1 .   transformation - based learning s learned model consists of a relatively short sequence of intuitive rules , stressing relevant features and highlighting important relationships between features and tags  ( brill , 1995a ) .",
    "thus , transformation - based learning s learned model offers insights into a _ theory _ to explain the training data .",
    "this is especially useful in dialogue act tagging , which currently lacks a systematic theory .",
    "2 .   with its iterative training algorithm ,",
    "when developing a new rule , transformation - based learning can consider tags that have been produced by previous rules  ( ramshaw and marcus , 1994 ) .",
    "since the dialogue act of an utterance is affected by the surrounding dialogue acts , this leveraged learning approach can directly integrate the relevant contextual information into the rules .",
    "in addition , transformation - based learning can accommodate the focus shifts that frequently occur in discourse by utilizing features that consider tags of varying distances .",
    "our transformation - based learning system is very flexible with respect to the types of features it can utilize .",
    "for example , it can learn set - valued features , such as cue patterns . additionally , because of the monte carlo improvement",
    ", our system can handle a very large number of features .",
    "4 .   for the dialogue act tagging task",
    ", people still do nt know what features are relevant , so it is very difficult to construct an appropriate set of rule templates .",
    "fortunately , transformation - based learning is capable of discarding irrelevant rules , as ramshaw and marcus  ( 1994 ) showed experimentally , so it is not necessary that _ all _ of the given rule templates be useful .",
    "ramshaw and marcus s  ( 1994 ) experiments suggest that transformation - based learning tends to be resistant to the overfitting problem .",
    "this can be explained by observing how the rule sequence produced by transformation - based learning progresses from general rules to specific rules .",
    "the early rules in the sequence are based on many examples in the training corpus , and so they are likely to generalize effectively to new data . later in the sequence ,",
    "the rules do nt receive as much support from the training data , and their applicability conditions tend to be very specific , so they have little or no effect on new data .",
    "thus , resistance to overfitting is an emergent property of the transformation - based learning algorithm .    for the future ,",
    "we intend to investigate a wider variety of features and explore different methods for collecting cue patterns to increase our system s accuracy scores further .",
    "although we compared transformation - based learning with a few very different machine learning algorithms , we still hope to examine other methods , such as naive bayes . in addition , we plan to run our experiments with different corpora to confirm that the encouraging results of our extensions to transformation - based learning can be generalized to different data , languages , domains , and tasks .",
    "we would also like to extend our system so that it may learn from untagged data , as there is still very little tagged data available in discourse .",
    "brill developed an unsupervised version of transformation - based learning for part - of - speech tagging  ( brill , 1995b ) , but this algorithm must be initialized with instances that can be tagged unambiguously ( such as `` the '' , which is always a determiner ) , and in dialogue act tagging there are very few unambiguous examples .",
    "we intend to investigate the following weakly - supervised approach : first , the system will be trained on a small set of tagged data to produce a number of different committee members . then given untagged data , it will derive tags with confidence measures . those tags that receive very high confidence can be used as unambiguous examples to drive the unsupervised version of transformation - based learning .",
    "we wish to thank the members of the verbmobil research group at dfki in germany , particularly norbert reithinger , jan alexandersson , and elisabeth maier , for providing the first author with the opportunity to work with them and generously granting him access to the verbmobil corpora .",
    "this work was partially supported by the nsf grant # ger-9354869 .",
