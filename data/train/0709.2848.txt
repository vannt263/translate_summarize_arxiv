    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) display a wide variety of shapes ranging from round , which can be simply understood in terms of the symmetric interacting stellar winds ( isw ) model @xcite , through complex symmetrical shapes , such as hour - glasses and butterflies , to shapes which have only rotational point - symmetry .",
    "many theories have been introduced to explain these complex shapes from adding an asymmetric slow wind to the isw model @xcite to involving the effects of binary central stars @xcite and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "observations of pne have shown several cases where only the outer shell shows a departure from symmetry . in these cases ,",
    "the cause of the asymmetries has been postulated to be an interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "interaction with the ism by pne was first discussed by @xcite with an early theoretical study by @xcite employing the snow - plough model of @xcite .",
    "smith concluded that a nebula will fade away before any disruption of the nebular shell becomes noticable .",
    "@xcite used the same approximation with higher relative velocities to the ism and ism densities and concluded similarly .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that many pne with large angular extent show signs of pn ",
    "ism interaction and that all nebulae containing central stars with a proper motion greater than 0.015 arcsecyr@xmath0 do so .",
    "@xcite hydrodynamically modelled the interaction revealing that the pn shell is first compressed in the direction of motion and then in later stages this part of the shell is significantly decelerated with respect to the central star .",
    "both conclude that the interaction with the ism becomes dominant when the density of the nebular shell has dropped below a certain critical limit , typically @xmath1@xmath2 for a pn in the galactic plane .",
    "these low densities require large , evolved nebulae , in agreement with the observational result of @xcite .",
    "they noted that their simple picture breaks down for high velocity pne in a low density environment . here , a rayleigh  taylor ( rt ) instability develops , leading to shell fragmentation .",
    "their 2d hydrodynamic simulations started with the nebula shell already formed but above their upper density limit for ism interaction to become apparent .",
    "the fragmentation predicted by @xcite was discussed in more depth by @xcite and then @xcite . in these papers , dgani and soker applied theoretical results of hydrodynamic instabilities and found that the rt instability can play an important role in the shaping of the outer regions of a pn .",
    "they suggested these rt instabilities can cause fragmentation of the bow shock with kelvin  helmholtz instabilities also playing a part .",
    "any fragmentation caused by these instabilities would only be present if the relative velocity to the ism of the central star was greater than 100 .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as vgm ) pointed out that the pn ",
    "ism interaction had previously been studied by considering the interaction after the nebular shell had formed .",
    "pne are formed when a slow wind ( @xmath3 ) ejected during the preceding asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of evolution is swept up into a dense shell by a fast wind ( @xmath4 ) from the exposed , ionizing hot white dwarf core .",
    "vgm performed 2d hydrodynamic simulations and found that crucially the interaction begins during the agb phase where the slow wind is shaped by the ism . the pn forms in this pre - shaped environment .",
    "choosing a conservative relative velocity of the central star to the ism of 20  and a low density of the surrounding ism of @xmath5 @xmath2 , they discovered that the pn is brightened on the upstream side of the nebular shell .",
    "they concluded that pn ",
    "ism interaction provides an adequate mechanism to explain the high rate of observed asymmetries in the external shells of pne .",
    "further , stripping of mass downstream during the agb phase provides a possible solution to the problem of missing mass in pn whereby only a small fraction of the mass ejected during the agb phase is inferred to be present during the post  agb phase .",
    "observational evidence for the effect of the ism on agb wind stuctures , supporting vgm s findings was found by @xcite .",
    "vgm found that simple hydrodynamic simulations can reveal much information regarding the pn ",
    "ism interaction . in order to investigate the interaction further",
    ", we have developed a triple - wind model including an initial slow agb wind , a subsequent fast post  agb wind , and a third continuous wind reflecting the movement through the ism . employing a parallel 3d hydrodynamic scheme developed by @xcite ,",
    "we have understood the formation of the extreme pn sh 2 - 188 @xcite and the structure around the agb star r hya @xcite .",
    "sh 2 - 188 was thought to be a bright one - sided arc - like pn when new observations taken as part of the isaac newton group photometric h@xmath6 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas ) @xcite revealed a faint ring - like completion of the arc and a tail stretching away in opposition to the bright arc .",
    "our model revealed this pn to be a strong pn ",
    "ism interaction where the central star is moving at 125  in the direction of the bright arc relative to the ism and the nebular shell is interacting with a bow shock formed during the agb phase between the slow wind and the ism .",
    "recent ir observations of the agb star r hya as part of the miriad programme @xcite have revealed the arc - like structure to the north west of the star to be a bow shock ahead of the star @xcite .",
    "the existence of this agb wind bow shock has confirmed the hypothesis that the major shaping effect for the pn ",
    "ism interaction occurs during the agb phase of evolution .    using our model , we have now run a comprehensive set of 92 simulations equivalent to over 5 years of single cpu computation time investigating the pn ",
    "ism interaction . in this paper , we discuss a representative set of these simulations and generalise the interaction into four distinct stages , indicating its effect on shaping and other pn characteristics .",
    "we apply our generalisation to a selection of pne from the iac morphological catalog of northern galactic planetary nebulae @xcite and find indications of interaction with the ism in approximately 20 per cent of objects .",
    "the numerical scheme , cubempi , used in our simulations to solve the hydrodynamics equations employs a second - order godunov solution due to @xcite . in recent years",
    ", variants of cubempi have been used to shed light on nova explosions @xcite , extragalactic jet - cloud interactions @xcite and most recently pn @xcite .",
    "the version of the scheme used here is posed in 3d cartesian coordinates , fully parallel and includes the effect of radiative cooling due to the cooling curves of @xcite above 10@xmath7 k as the cooling curves extend no further .",
    "the parallelisation was developed using the mpi library and involves slicing the numerical domain along an axis and communicating relevant boundary data at the correct points during a computational timestep .",
    "the parallelisation has been successfully tested for efficiency and scalability .",
    "the scheme itself has also been tested on a number of standard computational fluid dynamics problems and performed well on all tests .",
    "it has been further tested using astrophysical problems which have highlighted its capability for shock capturing , an important requirement for the modelling of pne .",
    "the parallelisation and testing are detailed in @xcite    the numerical domain consists of a cubic grid , 200 cells along each axis , containing a total of @xmath8 uniformly - spaced cells .",
    "the grid is sliced ten times for parallelisation purposes and distributed across ten processors of the cobra beowulf - type supercomputer at jodrell bank .",
    "this level of parallel distribution is a comprimise between computational efficiency and availability of computational resources .    in the triple - wind model",
    ", the simulation is performed in the frame of reference of the star , which is placed at cell coordinates ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "mass loss is effected by setting the values of hydrodynamic variables ( density , momentum density and energy density ) in a volume - weighted spherical region of radius 5@xmath10 cells centred on the star .",
    "the radius of this source volume has been chosen by an experimental process balancing production of the most spherical pn when modelling the stationary isw model with spherically symmetric winds ( i.e. reducing the pixelation of the cartesian grid ) and avoidance of interference with results of the simulation .",
    "the conditions within the source volume are reset at the beginning of every computational timestep to drive the ejection of the wind .",
    "the wind has been modelled with a spherically symmetric constant mass - loss rate @xmath11 with constant velocity @xmath12 and temperature @xmath13 .",
    "density in the source volume has been defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the physical radial distance from the central star .",
    "the other hydrodynamic variables are set accordingly .",
    "simulation of movement through the ism is achieved by flowing ism material in at the ( @xmath16 ) boundary with a velocity vector v@xmath17 , v@xmath18 , v@xmath19 = ( @xmath20,0,0 ) .",
    "the ism density and temperature are constant .",
    "all other numerical boundaries have conditions allowing material to flow out of the domain freely . gas pressures in the model are calculated assuming an ideal gas equation of state .",
    "in our simulations , we have held the following parameter values constant : for the slow agb wind a velocity of @xmath21  and a temperature of @xmath22 k as the cooling curves extend no further ; for the fast post  agb wind a mass - loss rate of @xmath23 , a velocity of @xmath24  and a temperature of @xmath25 k ; and for the ism a temperature of @xmath26 k , characteristic of the warm intercloud medium @xcite .",
    "these parameter values are typical of observations of pn conditions . in the model ,",
    "the switch between the agb wind and the post  agb wind is instantaneous and occurs after @xmath27 years of agb evolution , typical of the duration of this phase . in view of the still considerable uncertainties on the detailed properties and evolution of these winds",
    ", more detailed temporal variations have not been modelled .",
    "we have discussed this further in later sections .    in our simulations , we have varied three parameters : relative velocity of the star to the surrounding ism , slow wind mass - loss rate @xmath28 and ism density @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite discussed  of stars in the galactic plane : typical thin disk stars resulting in a pn appear to have a transverse variation on their galactic rotation velocity of 35  50 ; thick disk stars , rarer in the galactic plane , have a typical range of 50  75 ; halo objects can have a typical variation greater than 100 .",
    "older stellar groups , such as pne , are characterized by larger velocity dispersions and asymmetric drift velocities than are younger stellar groups .",
    "the average transverse motions of stars in the solar neighbourhood have been found to be in the range of 2040  with the tail of the distribution up to 130  @xcite . for white dwarfs",
    "an average velocity of @xmath30  has been found by @xcite . in terms of galactic disk pne , @xcite state 60  as an average velocity . for galactic bulge pne",
    ", velocities up to 200  could be reasonably expected as these stars are dynamically a much hotter population .",
    "therefore , we have considered a range of from 0 , testing the implementation of the triple - wind model and its ability to simulate a spherical nebula , up to 200 , in 25 steps in order to fully cover the range of velocities of pn - forming stars in the galaxy .",
    "the typical density of the ism in the galactic plane is approximately @xmath31 = @xmath32 @xmath2 up to a scale height of 100 pc above the plane where it then begins to drops off exponentially .",
    "we have used three constant values of ism density @xmath33 = 2 , 0.1 & 0.01 @xmath2 to investigate this range .",
    "these densities are comparable to that of the warm intercloud medium @xcite .",
    "mass - loss rates during the agb phase of evolution vary between 10@xmath34 ",
    "10@xmath35  with brief periods of enhanced mass - loss up to 10@xmath36 .",
    "as we are using a constant mass - loss rate , we have not modelled mass - loss variations .",
    "we have used values of 10@xmath34 , @xmath37 , 10@xmath35 & @xmath38  up to  = 75 . above this velocity",
    ", we have not used a mass - loss rate of 10@xmath35  due to time and computational constraints .",
    "in our initial test cases  is set to zero .",
    "the forward shock driven by the agb wind is spherical and expands into a homogeneous ism . the shocked ism material behind the forward shock is of relatively low density with the contact discontinuity and the reverse shock expanding spherically symmetrically outward .",
    "the unshocked agb wind behind the reverse shock is also spherically symmetric around the central star with an approximate 1/r@xmath39 distribution .",
    "after 500000 years , the fast post  agb wind is introduced into this distribution driving a shock which sweeps up the agb wind material into an expanding shell .",
    "the shell has a relatively high density and a temperature on the scale of 1020000 k. the stromgren sphere around the central star encompasses the shell indicating the material in the shell would be ionized and observable as a pn .",
    "this method of pn formation is the result of interacting stellar winds and is the premise of the isw model .",
    "next , we added the ism velocity .",
    "we display and discuss a representative set of five simulations covering various parameter values which serve to illustrate the range of pn structures formed in all our simulations .",
    "table [ parameters ] shows the parameter values for these five simulations .",
    "the resulting pn structure is discussed for each case . in our online supplementary appendix ,",
    "we have also included snapshots at the end of the agb phase of evolution and parameter values for our full set of simulations .",
