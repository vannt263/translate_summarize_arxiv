    "blazars offer us the unique possibility to study the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of relativistic jets .",
    "being radio galaxies with their jets oriented at relatively small angles with respect to our line of sight they profit from the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "this enhances dramatically ( by factors up to @xmath0 ) the intrinsic jet ( core ) flux and thus makes it the dominant continuum emission at all frequencies [ see @xcite for a review ] .    as first discussed by @xcite two emission processes",
    "dominate the multiwavelength seds of relativistic jets and , therefore , of blazars , namely , synchrotron and inverse compton .",
    "these give rise to two prominent emission peaks in a logarithmic @xmath1 plot , which were observationally demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron emission peak ( @xmath2 ) in blazars is observed within a wide range of frequencies ( from infrared to soft - x - rays ) in sources with weak emission lines , the bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , strong - lined blazars , the flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , had until recently synchrotron emission peaks at relatively low energies and thus x - rays dominated by inverse compton emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on this finding some authors proposed the so - called `` blazar sequence '' @xcite .",
    "this scenario advocates that the frequency of the synchrotron emission peak is governed by particle compton cooling by an external radiation field .",
    "such a field , produced by , e.g. , the accretion disk or broad emission line region ( blr ) , both more luminous in radio quasars than in bl lacs , is expected to interact with the particles in the jet via the inverse compton process causing them to lose energy .",
    "therefore , within this scenario radio quasars with @xmath3 hz and thus x - rays dominated by synchrotron emission are not expected to exist .",
    "two new surveys have recently shown that mere selection effects had prevented us so far from finding `` x - ray loud '' radio quasars , allowing for the possibility that radio quasars with high @xmath4 existed . about 10% of the fsrq discovered in the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , subsequent investigations of the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) and the slew survey revealed that these radio quasars had gone undetected in previous surveys @xcite .",
    "the definite proof of the synchrotron nature of the x - ray emission in these newly discovered blazars , however , requires x - ray spectroscopy .",

    "we have added different constraints in the case of the _ xmm - newton _ and the _ chandra _ observed samples ( see below ) .    as first suggested by @xcite bl lacs that emit synchrotron radiation which peaks at low ( ir / optical ) frequencies , the so - called low energy - peaked bl lacs ( lbl ) ,",
    "can be distinguished from those that emit synchrotron radiation which peaks at higher ( uv / soft - x - ray ) frequencies , the so - called high energy - peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) , by their distinct ratios between their radio , optical and x - ray fluxes .",
    "these ratios are usually studied by plotting the objects in an ( @xmath15 ) plane , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the usual rest - frame effective spectral indices defined between 5 ghz , 5000   , and 1 kev . in this plane",

    "[ aroaox ] ) .",
    "a sequence of synchrotron emission peak frequencies in bl lacs produces a specific trail in the ( @xmath20 ) plane @xcite .",
    "while the synchrotron emission peak is at low enough frequencies for the x - rays to be dominated by inverse compton radiation ( as in lbl ) , @xmath18 is roughly constant , whereas @xmath16 decreases and @xmath21 increases as the peak moves to higher energies ( see also @xcite ) . when the synchrotron radiation starts to dominate the x - ray band ( as in hbl ) , @xmath18 starts to decrease , with lbl and hbl having values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively @xcite . now @xmath16 is roughly constant ( and low ) and @xmath21 decreases .",

    "this discrepancy suggests that a single emission component can not account for the fluxes at both frequencies .",
    "therefore , either the soft - x - ray flux is synchrotron and the optical / uv fluxes are not , in which case the accretion disk could produce the optical / uv emission ( see section [ selection ] ) , or the optical / uv magnitudes sample the synchrotron jet component ( which has @xmath111 hz ) , but the observed soft x - ray spectral slope is too flat ( we refer here and in the following to `` flat '' and `` steep '' in @xmath113 ) to be synchrotron emission alone .    a similar argument for an additional emission component",
    "can also be made for rgb j2229@xmath63057 , but less stringently so , since its optical / uv magnitudes and x - ray spectrum are not simultaneous .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that rgb j2229@xmath63057 and wga j0447@xmath310322 are similar cases , since their best - fit x - ray broken power - laws have similarly flat spectral slopes and low break energies . for rgb j0112@xmath63818 ,",
    "an extrapolation of the soft x - ray power - law to lower energies predicts fluxes similar to the observed optical magnitudes .",

    "the fact that an emission component in addition to synchrotron is required at either optical / uv or soft x - ray frequencies ( or both ) for wga j0447@xmath310322 and rgb j2229@xmath63057 means that these sources are not strong - lined analogs to hbl . on the other hand ,",
    "if instead the analogy to `` intermediate '' bl lacs holds for the three sources well fit by a broken power - law , as suggested by their x - ray spectrum , we expect their synchrotron emission peak to be at relatively low frequencies ( typically @xmath114 hz ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".      given that in none of our sources we detected an x - ray spectrum dominated by jet synchrotron emission the important question arises : why do the selected radio quasars have multiwavelength flux ratios typical of hbl ?",
    "our method selected sources based on their high x - ray to radio flux ratios ( low @xmath18 ) as well as high optical to radio flux ratios ( low @xmath16 ) . therefore ,",
    "if it is not a jet synchrotron spectrum peaking at uv / soft - x - ray frequencies and dominating the x - rays that increases both the optical and x - ray fluxes relative to that at radio frequencies ( as in hbl ) , a different emission component must cause a similar effect .",
    "since our sources are radio quasars with strong broad emission lines , the most likely component increasing the optical flux relative to that at radio frequencies is the accretion disk .",
    "however , low - redshift sources have usually low - luminosity agn and their optical flux could be instead enhanced by the host galaxy emission .",
    "our estimate of the fluxes of these two thermal emission components ( section [ thermal ] ) suggests that the accretion disk can contribute significantly to the optical fluxes of the majority of our sources ( 8/10 objects ; see figs .",
    "[ xmmsed ] and [ chandrased ] ) .",
    "the host galaxy , on the other hand , appears to dominate the optical magnitudes of only the two most nearby objects , namely , rgb j2256@xmath62618 ( @xmath115 ) and rgb j2318@xmath63048 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the estimated accretion disk spectrum approximate well the optical spectra of 5/8 , 2/8 and 1/8 objects if a blr covering factor of @xmath117 , 10 and 30% , respectively , is assumed . in 5/8 sources",
    "we observe moderate variability ( by factors of @xmath118 ) between the optical spectra and the magnitudes .",
    "this variability behavior is compatible with that of radio - quiet quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , as in these , it could be due to a change in accretion rate ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this respect",
    "we note that in particular the simultaneous om magnitudes ( and in the case of wga j0304@xmath60002 also the simultaneous sdss magnitudes ) mimic the slope of the estimated accretion disk spectrum .",
    "our interpretation that the host galaxy dominates the optical fluxes of the two most nearby objects is supported by the fact that they appear extended on digitized images from the second palomar sky survey ( poss2 ) .",
    "additionally , their extended near - ir magnitudes lie well above those from the 2mass point source catalog and comply with the estimated flux and spectral shape of the host galaxy .",
    "similarly , their optical spectra mimic the expected spectral shape of the host galaxy , but the small aperture used in spectroscopy underestimates its flux .",
    "generally , accretion disk emission is expected to be unimportant in fsrq .",
    "their jets are assumed to be strongly beamed and to dominate the emission even at uv frequencies , where the accretion disk spectrum peaks @xcite .",

    "11 ) have recently shown that a flat radio spectrum does not always ensure that the radio source is highly core - dominated and thus strongly beamed .",
    "this means that in some ( few ) fsrq the accretion disk emission could dominate over the ( weakly beamed ) jet spectrum .",
    "as already discussed in section [ uvpeak ] , our sample seems to fall in this category . in this respect",
    "we note that the _ chandra _ sources were chosen also because of their extended radio emission .",
    "nevertheless , among the _ xmm - newton _ sources , which were chosen based on their estimated high @xmath2 , 2/4 sources are lobe - dominated and one source has log @xmath119 .",
    "given that thermal accretion disk emission is pronounced in our sources one can assume that their x - ray fluxes are increased relative to that at radio frequencies by the same component that renders also radio - quiet quasars strong x - ray emitters . in support of the notion that both the optical / uv and x - ray fluxes in our fsrq have a similar ( non - jet ) origin as in radio - quiet quasars are also their @xmath17 values ( see fig .",
    "[ aroaox ] ) , which are not inconsistent with those of radio - quiet quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emission of radio - quiet quasars is usually dominated by a power - law with a flat spectral index [ e.g. , @xmath120 @xcite ; @xmath121 @xcite ] , which is generally interpreted as the comptonized hot corona of the accretion disk .",
    "the seven sources well fit by a single power - law have an average x - ray spectral index of @xmath122 , similar ( @xmath123 level ) to the averages found for radio - quiet quasars .",
    "but more than half of these sources ( 4/7 objects ) show also a hint of a broken power - law in their x - ray spectra ( thin , red solid lines in figs .",
    "[ xmmsed ] and [ chandrased ] ; see also section [ discuss ] ) .",
    "in particular , in wga j0110@xmath311647 , wga j2347@xmath60852 and rgb j2318@xmath63048 a different ( steep ) component seems to emerge at higher x - ray energies ( @xmath124 , 5 and 3 kev , respectively ) , and in wga j0304@xmath60002 a broken power - law similar in break energy to that observed in wga j0447@xmath310322 and rgb j2229@xmath63057 but with much flatter both soft and hard x - ray spectral indices is evident at a lower significance level .",
    "especially the case of wga j0304@xmath60002 suggests that in the selected fsrq the flat x - ray power - law component present in radio - quiet quasars adds onto the jet sed , leading to an increase in total x - ray flux and to a flattening of both soft and hard x - ray spectral slopes .",
    "then in sources where this component is particularly strong relative to the jet , such as , e.g. , wga j0110@xmath311647 , the jet inverse compton component can emerge only at higher energies .",
    "to a first approximation we expect in this scenario that the stronger the relativistic beaming , the stronger the jet contribution and , therefore , the less flattened the x - ray spectral slopes . and indeed , two of the three sources well fit by a broken power - law are also those with the highest radio core - dominance values in the sample ( log @xmath125 for wga j0447@xmath310322 and log @xmath126 for rgb j0112@xmath63818 )",
    ".    the additional flat x - ray power - law will dominate the jet sed in particular around the spectral transition point between the synchrotron and inverse compton components .",
    "this is exemplified by our simulations in fig .",
    "[ corona ] for which we have used the average blazar sed of @xcite and to which we have added a component with a spectral index of @xmath127 , assuming flux ratios at the jet sed transition point of 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 100 , and 150 . therefore , an increased x - ray flux relative to that at radio frequencies is expected to be more pronounced in fsrq whose spectral break is at or around the selection x - ray energy . in this respect",
    "we note that 4/10 sources in our sample and 2/4 sources observed by @xcite have a detected jet sed transition point around @xmath128 kev ( the x - ray energy used to calculate the @xmath18 and @xmath21 values ) .",
    "@xcite and this work presented x - ray spectroscopy for a total of 14 `` x - ray loud '' radio quasars and only one source , namely , rgb j1629@xmath64008 , had x - rays dominated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "we have shown that this modest success in finding radio quasars with synchrotron x - rays is due to the adopted selection criteria , which efficiently select bl lacs with synchrotron x - rays , but do not work well for radio quasars .",
    "nevertheless , the important question remains : does a large population of radio quasars with synchrotron x - rays exist , and , if yes , how can they be efficiently found ?",
    "an efficient selection of radio quasars candidate to have synchrotron x - rays could be based on the diagram presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "12 ) , which plots log @xmath129 versus log @xmath97 , where @xmath108 and @xmath130 are the radio core and total x - ray luminosity , respectively . in this plot",
    "high - energy peaked fsrq are expected to separate from the rest of the population , since they should be those strongly core - dominated radio quasars ( i.e. , with log @xmath131 ) that have the lowest @xmath129 ratios .    for bl lacs values of log @xmath132 are known to be indicative of synchrotron x - rays @xcite .",
    "however , based on the results in the previous section lower values must be chosen for radio quasars .",
    "e.g. , whereas rgb j1629@xmath64008 , which is strongly core - dominated ( log @xmath133 ) , has a ratio of log @xmath134 @xcite , the two strongly core - dominated sources in our sample , namely , wga j0447@xmath310322 and rgb j0112@xmath63818 , have ratios of log @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xcite , respectively , which are apparently not low enough to be indicative of synchrotron x - rays .",
    "but it remains to be shown if radio quasars with synchrotron x - rays exist in large numbers and both a positive and a negative result will reveal highly significant agn physics . a negative result could tell us that the so - called `` blazar sequence '' @xcite holds to some level @xcite , which would mean that the particles in the relativistic jets of agn strongly interact with the ambient photon field , such as the one produced by , e.g. , the accretion disk - blr complex , already in the most inner regions where they are produced . a positive result ,",
    "on the other hand , could mean that the basic properties of agn jets , such as , e.g. , their powers , magnetic field strengths or velocities , are not determined by the presence or absence of emission line regions in the nuclear regions .",
    "finding radio quasars with synchrotron x - rays in large numbers will also provide present and up - coming @xmath137-ray missions , such as agile and the gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , with plenty of targets . a synchrotron spectrum peaking at uv",
    "/ soft - x - ray energies produces an inverse compton spectrum with peak at @xmath137-ray frequencies .",
    "but such jets have been detected so far only in a ( small ) part of the bl lac population , the hbl . since at the high fluxes required by the sensitivity of these missions radio quasars",
    "are by far more abundant than bl lacs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high - energy peaked fsrq instead could become the prime targets .",
    "a considerable fraction of fsrq discovered in the dxrbs and rgb survey have multiwavelength flux ratios similar to those of bl lacs with synchrotron x - rays .",
    "however , the definite proof of the synchrotron nature of their x - ray emission requires x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite observed four `` x - ray loud '' radio quasars and found one object ( rgb j1629@xmath64008 ) to have x - rays dominated by synchrotron radiation . in this paper",
    "we have presented x - ray spectroscopy of a further ten of these sources .",
    "the main results are :    \\1 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 7/10 sources is well fit by a single power - law with spectral index @xmath138 , indicating that synchrotron x - ray emission is not the dominant component .",
    "the remaining three sources are well fit by a broken power - law with soft and hard spectral indices @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , which , as in `` intermediate '' bl lacs , suggests that we observe the spectral transition between the synchrotron and inverse compton jet components .",
    "the lack of success in finding radio quasars with x - ray spectra dominated by jet synchrotron emission can be attributed to the employed selection method .",
    "this was developed for bl lacs and requires the sources to have high both optical / uv and x - ray fluxes relative to that at radio frequencies ( low @xmath18 and @xmath16 values ) . in the case of radio",
    "quasars these criteria yield predominantly those ( few ) sources that have a thermal and non - thermal accretion disk component strong enough to dominate over the ( weakly beamed ) jet emission .",
    "the majority of the observed fsrq are either lobe - dominated ( i.e. , have log @xmath141 ; 4/10 objects ) or are only slightly core - dominated ( i.e. , have @xmath110 ; 4/10 objects ) .",
    "the discovered radio quasars with their relatively low @xmath142 values and strong accretion disk signatures represent a population intermediate between `` classical '' fsrq and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this makes them unique probes for studying the poorly known accretion disk - jet connection .",
    "\\4 . a refined selection technique based on the work of @xcite",
    "is proposed to be used to search for high - energy peaked fsrq , which , since their inverse compton emission is expected to peak at @xmath137-ray frequencies , could be prime targets for glast and agile .",
    "the recipe is : ( i ) choose highly core - dominated radio quasars , and among these ( ii ) choose radio quasars with low radio core to x - ray luminosity ratios of log @xmath143 .",
