    "civil aviation traffic has been broadly democratised within the last few decades , leading to ever - increasing numbers of both business and pleasure passengers .",
    "the downside of this increased worldwide connectivity is the very rapid global spreading of diseases @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , new infectious diseases are emerging , driven by human or ecologic causes @xcite , and microorganisms are developing various forms of multiple drug resistance @xcite .",
    "it is therefore imperative to develop more rapid , mobile , and reliable methods for pathogen detection .",
    "one of the paths being followed is the development of smart hydrogels , which respond to various stimuli @xcite .",
    "the scenario we have in mind is that viral pathogens diffuse into the hydrogel , where they bind to specific sites and effect a local mechanical deformation . to cause macroscopic effects",
    ", the pathogens size must be comparable to the typical mesh size of the hydrogel .",
    "a similar situation was investigated in a single particle tracking study of submicron tracer beads in reconstituted f - actin networks , observing _",
    "anomalous diffusion _",
    "@xcite @xmath0 where the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath1 depended on the ratio of the tracer bead size versus the typical mesh size of the actin network : for relatively large beads @xmath1 was shown to decrease to zero , while for small beads @xmath1 converged to one , the case of normal diffusion @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion of the type ( [ eq : anomdiff ] ) was observed for similarly - sized tracer beads in wormlike micellar solutions @xcite , as well as for the motion of various objects in the macromolecularly crowded cytoplasm of living cells such as the infectious pathway of adeno - associated viruses in living hela cells @xcite , as well as for submicron lipid and insulin granules in living fission yeast and min6 insulinoma cells @xcite . for reviews on anomalous diffusion ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite , and for subdiffusion in crowded systems , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    given these experimental findings",
    "it is pertinent to ask whether the motion of pathogens in a hydrogel is equally subdiffusive .",
    "here we address this question by considering the path of the pathogen through the hydrogel as the motion of a particle of finite size through a tortuous , corrugated channel with varying width .",
    "the particle gets repeatedly held up by bottlenecks in the channel , and may transiently bind to the channel walls , representing the interaction with specific binding site for the pathogen in the hydrogel . using an ensemble of channel geometries in our numerical analysis , we account for the different paths the pathogen can take through the hydrogel .",
    "we find that indeed the particle in their channel performs transient subdiffusion , that we analyse in terms of the anomalous diffusion exponent , the number of successful moves with respect to the number of simulations steps , and the effective long - time diffusivity , as function of the characteristic channel geometry parameters .    the theoretical description of the motion of particles in confined geometries like channels ( 2d ) or pores ( 3d ) with varying width has a long - standing history ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in a seminal work zwanzig derived a modified fick - jacobs equation which is at the basis of most subsequent quasi - one - dimensional descriptions @xcite , @xmath2 here @xmath3 describes the local concentration of particles at position @xmath4 and time @xmath5 , @xmath6 the width of the channel at position @xmath4 and most importantly @xmath7 is an effective position - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "subsequently , several different forms for @xmath7 were derived and applied to various systems @xcite .",
    "taking along only first order derivatives of the width profile @xmath6 , kalinay and percus @xcite ( see also martens et al .",
    "@xcite ) obtained the closed form result @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the position - independent diffusion coefficient in the absence of confinement .",
    "we note that the presence of an @xmath4-dependent diffusivity in free space is sufficient to effect various forms of anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "however , the above forms of @xmath7 are restricted to symmetric channels , i.e. , channels with a straight centre - line .",
    "this constraint was removed in an approach by bradley @xcite , which was subsequently generalised by dagdug and pineda to @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the vertical position of the centre - line at horizontal position @xmath4 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddp ] ) generalises all the previous results for @xmath7 , for instance , one obtains the result ( [ eq : dkp ] ) for symmetrical channels by setting @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "as detailed by zwanzig @xcite , in a system with periodic boundary conditions the effective diffusion coefficient in the long - time regime , @xmath13 , is obtained by using the following formula introduced by lifson and jackson @xcite and generalised by festa and galleani dagliano @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the average over one period .",
    "thus , for any channel with width profile @xmath6 and centre - line @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddp ] ) can be used to calculate @xmath16 , which in turn is used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deff ] ) to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "the above theories based on the fick - jacobs formalism apply to point - like particles , that is , the particle can move along the channel as long as the width is not equal to zero . for our scenario of pathogens moving in a channel",
    ", we argued that the pathogen size is comparable to the channel width .",
    "thus , the pathogen can only fully cross the channel when the width profile @xmath6 at any position is larger than the particle size .",
    "systems containing finite - size particles were indeed studied in literature @xcite .",
    "essentially , in all formulae the channel width @xmath6 has to be replaced by an effective channel width .",
    "another modification with respect to the fick - jacobs approach that we consider here concerns the boundary conditions .",
    "usually , reflecting boundary conditions are used , i.e. , when the particle collides with the channel walls , its perpendicular motion is simply reversed . in the pathogen - hydrogel scenario ,",
    "the pathogen will ( transiently ) bind to specific binding sites incorporated into the hydrogel .",
    "here we explicitly include such effects by reactive boundary conditions , due to which the model particle will transiently be immobilised by binding to the channel wall .",
    "moreover , it may immediately rebind to the channel wall after unbinding . as we will see",
    ", this has a major effect on the particle motion .",
    "finally , the conventional fick - jacobs approach describes the motion of particles in a single channel with quenched geometry . however , for the application to the pathogen motion in the hydrogel , we mimic the possibility for particles to move on different paths across the hydrogel by sampling an ensemble of tracer particles in an ensemble of channel geometries .",
    "this ensemble of channels is characterised by a common set of structural parameters .",
    "the present study therefore represents an application of the fick - jacobs approach to the biophysical problem of pathogen motion in a complex , confining environment . at the same time",
    ", however , it significantly generalises the fick - jacobs model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "in the subsequent section we introduce the details of the numerical approach used in this study . in section 3",
    "we discuss how the numerical results are analysed in terms of time and ensemble averaged observables . in section 4",
    "we present the detailed results .",
    "section 5 puts our findings in perspective with respect to theory by dagdug and pineda , before drawing our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we study the diffusion through a two - dimensional channel with periodic boundary conditions in horizontal @xmath4-direction . in vertical @xmath18-direction",
    "the system is limited by two walls , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] .",
    "these two walls are described by @xmath19 points connected by straight lines , represented by the blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] . for numerical convenience",
    "the points of the channel wall reside on a lattice with unit lattice constant , which effectively determines the fundamental length scale of the system . due to the horizontal periodic boundary conditions the two leftmost and the two rightmost wall points are identical .",
    "their vertical distance ( in @xmath18-direction ) is denoted by @xmath20 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] .",
    "this is one of the fundamental parameters of the system and is called gap opening parameter in the following .",
    "we only consider channel configurations without touching or overlapping wall .",
    "moreover , we solely allow wall configurations in which the @xmath18-coordinates of nearest neighbour points within one wall differ by at most unity .",
    "this excludes the occurrence of extremely rugged walls .",
    "thus the size of the system is fully described by the gap opening parameter @xmath20 and the two ` displacement vectors ' of size @xmath21 for the upper and lower walls .",
    "the @xmath22 entry of this displacement vector denotes the difference between the @xmath18-coordinate of the @xmath23 and @xmath22 wall points for each of the two walls ( @xmath24 is counted from left to right ) . due to the constraints mentioned above only @xmath25 are valid entries , and",
    "the sum of all entries per wall must be zero to fulfil the periodic boundary requirement .    , particle size @xmath26 , step size @xmath27 , ruggedness parameter @xmath28 , and lateral channel length @xmath29.,width=302 ]    we consider channel walls with different contour lengths .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 describes the number of displacements of size @xmath31 which occur in a wall .",
    "we thus call it the ` ruggedness parameter ' . due to the periodic boundary constraint",
    "the number of jumps directed upwards must be equal to the one for jumps downwards for both walls .",
    "consequently , @xmath30 is an even number and lies in the interval @xmath32 $ ] ( for odd @xmath19 ) or @xmath33 $ ] ( for even @xmath19 ) .",
    "we only consider configurations in which @xmath30 is equal for the upper and lower walls .",
    "however , this does not confine our study to symmetric channels , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] .",
    "the position of the random walking particle is described by the position of its centre of mass , illustrated by the green cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] .",
    "its motion is off - lattice .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] , where a circle of radius @xmath34 ( the step size of the random walk ) is drawn around the particle s current position . for each step a random angle with respect to the @xmath4-axis",
    "is drawn , and the particle attempts to move its centre to the corresponding point on the dotted circle . to account for the diffusion of finite - sized particles through the channel , before executing a step we check whether the distance from the current position to the wall is sufficient . to this end ,",
    "the minimal distance to the wall is calculated for the trial position . only if it is larger than the particle size @xmath35 , the step is actually performed .",
    "this accessible space is limited by the two dotted brown lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme1 ] .",
    "their vertical distance is the effective channel width for the finite - sized particle , and it is the quantity to be inserted into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ddp ] ) to ( [ eq : deff ] ) .",
    "if the particle aims to move at a forbidden position , the step is cancelled and the particle remains at its current position , but time is increased by one unit .",
    "this corresponds to ` sticky ' boundary conditions , which mimic transient binding to the channel wall .",
    "the diffusing particle is initially placed in the middle of the channel in both @xmath4 and @xmath18 directions . however ,",
    "if such a starting position is not possible in the sense described above , the given channel configuration is dismissed and a new one chosen . @xmath36",
    "random walk steps are performed and the position in the @xmath4 direction is traced and analysed . if not stated otherwise , for each parameter set @xmath20 and @xmath30 the results were averaged over @xmath37 configurations using the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",

    "this method emphasises deviations from normal diffusion behaviour : curves with a negative slope represent subdiffusion . a typical plot is shown in fig .  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "we observe a weaker form of subdiffusion for times from roughly @xmath51 to @xmath52 time steps . around @xmath52 time steps ,",
    "there is a turnover to a more pronounced subdiffusive behaviour .",

    "we note that both time and ensemble msd coincide at longer times . on short time",
    "scales the ea msd curve lies above the eata msd curve due to the fact that , by construction , at the beginning of each trajectory the particle is placed in the middle of the channel . at such short times the probability that the particle sticks to the wall is greatly reduced compared to later times , and thus the ea msd attains larger values than the eata msd , which averages the behaviour along the entire time series .",
    "the anomalous behaviour displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] is one of the major results of this study .    in the following",
    "we study the slowing - down of the particle diffusion in terms of two quantities .",
    "first , in the normal diffusive behaviour beyond @xmath53 time steps we fit the eata msd data with a linear function in order to obtain the effective long time diffusion coefficient @xmath54 .",
    "this quantity is then compared with the theoretical value @xmath17 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : deff ] ) , since for each channel configuration we calculate @xmath16 via dagdug and pineda s formula ( [ eq : ddp ] ) , where @xmath6 is replaced by the effective channel width .",
    "we normalise the value of the effective long time diffusivity by the corresponding value in absence of walls , @xmath55 .",
    "second , we obtain the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath1 on time scales ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 time steps .",
    "similar results are obtained by studying the mean maximal excursion of the particle @xcite ( data not shown ) .",
    "before studying the effect of different parameter sets @xmath20 and @xmath30 to characterise the diffusion through this class of corrugated channels , we investigate in detail the features seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] from simulations with fixed channel wall configurations .",
    "we explicitly consider three exemplary configurations to illustrate the effect of the sticky boundary conditions .",
    "these configurations are characterised by the parameter pairs @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath48 , and @xmath56 and @xmath59 .",
    "the two configurations with non - flat walls are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : configs ] .",
    "the grey curves denote the actual position of the channel walls , while the bold blue and red curves mark the region , which is inaccessible for the particle s centre .     and the wall ruggedness parameter @xmath59 ( upper panel ) and @xmath58 , @xmath48 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the actual upper and lower walls are plotted as grey lines .",
    "the region bounded by the red and blue curves are accessible for the particle.,width=665 ]    while for a given wall configuration by the choice of the gap opening parameter @xmath20 we make sure that the particle finds sufficient space in the middle of the channel where it is initially placed , it is a priori not certain that the particle can traverse the entire channel .",
    "this is the case when at some point the upper and lower walls overlap . strictly speaking ,",
    "however , a passage is impossible only if there exists an overlap area whose width is at last of the step size @xmath34 . otherwise , due to the finite step size the particle can actually ` tunnel ' through such bottlenecks . the wall configuration depicted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] does not allow such a tunnelling for the given parameters @xmath56 and @xmath59 : the red and the black curve do not overlap .",
    "the situation is different in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] with @xmath58 and @xmath48 : the channel is blocked for the particle at @xmath60 .",
    "however , even if inaccessible regions in a given wall configuration exist but the overlap of the walls stretches over less than the distance @xmath61 , such a narrow straight constitutes a severe entropic bottleneck for the diffusing particle : there exists an appreciable possibility that the particle repeatedly sticks to the channel walls . to quantify the influence of the sticky walls we binned the channels into @xmath62 cells of length @xmath63 and extracted from our simulations how often the particle unsuccessfully tries to move to a new position while being in the corresponding bin .     of unsuccessful attempts to move to the next position along the channel as a function of the position @xmath4 along the channel , for the three wall configurations characterised by @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( green line ) , @xmath56 and @xmath59 ( blue line ) , and @xmath58 and @xmath48 ( red line).,width=332 ]    we first study the mean number @xmath64 of unsuccessful attempts for the three above sample configurations as a function of the particle position along the channel in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] .",
    "the green curve for the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 shows that for flat walls @xmath64 is approximately constant . the fact that this value is finite is a consequence of the sticky boundary condition at the edges of the system : namely , move attempts which would end at a position which is forbidden due to the finite size of the particle are not executed . if reflective walls were considered , any step could be executed and then @xmath65 . in the present case , the value of @xmath64 depends on the step size and the ( constant ) width of the channel . from fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] we deduce that @xmath66 .",
    "the blue curve in fig .  [ fig : histogram ] for @xmath56 and @xmath59 shows some variation as function of @xmath4 : where the channel is narrow , e.g. , around @xmath67 in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] , @xmath64 is much higher than at locations where the channel is wider , e.g. , in the middle of the channel . comparing the minimum and maximum of @xmath64 along the channel",
    ", the variation of @xmath64 makes up a factor of approximately @xmath68 .",
    "this effect is much more pronounced in the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] for the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath48 , corresponding to the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] : the curve is broken as two bins of the channel are inaccessible for the particle .",
    "in the bin to the right of the channel blockage the average number of unsuccessful tries is larger than @xmath63 .",
    "in other regions of the channel @xmath64 attains values similar to the ones in the other two configurations .",
    "hence , the mean number of unsuccessful motion attempts along the channel directly reflects the effective channel width and thus the local transport properties .",
    "additional information can be deduced from studying the probability distribution @xmath69 of the number @xmath70 of unsuccessful attempts in a row shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : extremedistrb ] , where we focus on the most distinct configuration with parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 corresponding to the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] . for better visibility",
    "we only consider extreme cases : namely , only the two bins with the highest and the two bins with the lowest mean number of motion attempts . in all four cases , the probability to find higher values of @xmath70 decreases . in regions where the channel is wide ( green and blue symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : extremedistrb ] ) this decay is very fast , such that within our simulation time there were never more than 19 subsequent unsuccessful attempts .",
    "otherwise , it becomes obvious that near severe bottlenecks the distribution of waiting times is much more heavy - tailed ( black and red symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : extremedistrb ] ) .",
    "up to @xmath71 unsuccessful attempts in a row are possible , with a probability of about @xmath72 .",

    "[ fig : configs ] with parameters @xmath58 and @xmath48 .",
    "we show the statistics for the bins centred around : @xmath73 ( black symbols ) , @xmath74 ( red symbols ) , @xmath75 ( green symbols ) , and @xmath76 ( blue symbols ) .",
    "the symbols for @xmath75 are almost fully covered by those for @xmath76.,width=332 ]    with this information , let us go back to the features of fig .  [ fig : sample ] . according to the fick - jacobs theory , whenever the width of the channel changes in the form of a bottleneck or a bulge , this slows down the diffusion of the particle @xcite :",
    "in the case of a bottleneck the particle may be reflected back , while in the case of a bulge the particle may execute many motion events off the minimal path along the channel .",
    "the effect of the entropic bottlenecks in our present case is amplified by the presence of the sticky boundary conditions . on all time - scales on which the particle interacts with the walls , it is slowed down in comparison to a particle moving in free space .",
    "this induces the transient subdiffusion in the ensemble and time averaged trajectories . on very long time scales ,",
    "when the configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] are equivalent to a single step size in a coarse - grained random walk on the whole periodic structure , normal diffusive behaviour is restored , but now with a reduced diffusion coefficient .",
    "this reduced coefficient takes into account all the intermediate contacts with the channel walls .",
    "thus , it is expected that more corrugated and/or tighter channels , which imply more frequent interaction with the walls should show reduced values of @xmath1 and a reduced effective diffusion coefficient on the ensemble level . to study these effects , in the following",
    "we systematically study the impact of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath30 on the transport through the channels in ensembles of size 25,000 .",

    "we see once more that the diffusion is quickest when the wall is smoother or , i.e. , when @xmath30 is smaller .",

    "[ fig : dofm1 g ] ) , it is instructive to study the average weighted effective width @xmath82 of the channels . here ,",
    "weighted means that for any blocked channel the width is set to zero .",
    "the weighted width is plotted as function of @xmath30 in fig .",

    "yet small values of @xmath30 the effective weighted channel width decreases , until it reaches a shallow minimum beyond which @xmath82 levels off to a plateau . while heavily rugged channel walls , in principle , can be tighter or more spacious than a flat configuration with the same gap opening @xmath20 , the tighter ones are in constant ` danger ' of precluding the particle passage .",
    "thus , the average width of those traversable channels is larger for more rugged wall configurations .",
    "this facilitates the transport through these configurations , as the sticky boundaries are further away .",
    "however , as remarked earlier , more rugged walls slow down the diffusion due to the occurrence of bulges and constrictions @xcite , such that we have two opposing effects , which mostly ( almost ) cancel each other .",
    "consequently , @xmath82 ( and thus @xmath78 ) reaches a plateau above a threshold value of @xmath30 .",

    "in order to compare our results obtained from ensembles of channel configurations with the result of dagdug and pineda , we make a simplifying assumption : for all unblocked configurations , we determine @xmath16 from eq .",
    "[ eq : ddp ] and subsequently @xmath17 from eq .",
    "[ eq : deff ] . for all blocked configurations the effective diffusivity @xmath85 accounts for the fact that on long time - scales particles in these configurations do not contribute significantly to the msd . finally , we average over all configurations in the ensemble and normalise through division by the diffusion coefficient in free space , @xmath86 .",
    "we compare these values with our fitted values of the normalised diffusion coefficient in the upper panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : drelcompdistr ] , for fixed values of the gap opening @xmath20 there is a linear relation between @xmath79 and @xmath87 .",
    "most of the data points are located within a @xmath94 confidence interval around dagdug and pineda s value .",
    "more explicitly , a linear fit of the data points obtained in a simulation series yields the following results . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the fitted relation between the two is @xmath95 , while for @xmath56 we find @xmath96 . for @xmath88 , @xmath51 , and @xmath97 we did not fit the data as there were only three values available .",
    "the fact that the slope of the fits is somewhat below @xmath63 shows that dagdug and pineda s formula , which only applies to systems with perfectly reflecting boundaries slightly overestimates the diffusion coefficient compared to our system with sticky boundary conditions .",
    "thus , as expected the additional interaction with the boundaries further slows down the diffusion , which is already reduced by the occurrence of entropic bottlenecks .",
    "this reasoning is further substantiated by the observation that in tighter channels ( with @xmath58 ) , where these surface effects play a more important role , the slope of the conversion formula is smaller , and the deviation from dagdug and pineda s formula is more pronounced . given the quite intricate form of the effective channel width ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : scheme1 ] and [ fig : configs ] ) it is not feasible to quantify this effect analytically .",
    "however , in the future other values of @xmath35 and @xmath34 could be considered to study the magnitude of the correction terms numerically .    that deviations of our results from dagdug and pineda s formula are also based on the fact that their analysis applies to one given channel configuration .",
    "driven by the physical application we here consider an ensemble of different channel wall configurations , solely defined by the fixed macroscopic parameters @xmath20 and @xmath30 .",
    "individual configurations may therefore differ considerably .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : drelcompdistr ] , where for all unblocked configurations the expected effective diffusion coefficient was calculated with dagdug and pineda s formula . for @xmath56 and four different values of @xmath30 we see that the distribution of values of @xmath87 is far from narrow .",
    "the values increasingly scatter for more rugged conformations ( higher values of @xmath30 ) .",
    "thus , the semi - quantitative agreement of our data with the theoretical prediction on an ensemble level is indeed remarkable .",
    "we studied the motion of finite - size particles through randomly corrugated channels with sticky walls , observing transient anomalous diffusion of the particles in their passage of the channel .",
    "we also obtained the long - time diffusion coefficient for this motion on time scales over which normal brownian diffusion is restored .",
    "the control parameters in our study were the gap opening parameter fixing the distance between the channel walls at the entrance and exit of the channel , as well as the wall ruggedness parameter setting the maximal variation of the channel wall configuration .",
    "we quantified the dependence of the anomalous diffusion exponent and long - time diffusion coefficient as function of the ruggedness and gap opening , and showed that both quantities are in fact correlated .",
    "we especially analysed the blocked channels , which the particle can not fully traverse .",
    "the long - time effective diffusion coefficient was shown to agree well with the prediction for point - like particles in channels with reflecting boundary conditions by dagdug and pineda . translated into the language of pathogens in hydrogels , whose motion we want to mimic in our numerical study of an ensemble of ` parallel ' channels with identical gap opening and ruggedness , our study provides statistical information on how many channels are blocked for the pathogen passage .    in future studies",
    "it might be interesting to replace our minimal model of interactions with the constituents of the hydrogel with a more realistic model .",
    "in particular , the introduction of dynamic boundaries , for example by varying the gap opening during the simulations might be worth considering in order to model the structural change of the hydrogel due to the binding of pathogens ."
