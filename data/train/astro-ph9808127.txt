    "following the discovery of the first binary pulsar b1913 + 16 ( hulse & taylor 1975 ) it was shown that its unseen companion is another neutron star ( taylor , fowler & mcculloch 1979 ) .",
    "although four other neutron star binary systems are now known ( see e.g.  fryer & kalogera 1997 for a recent discussion ) , psr b1913 + 16 remains a unique system in the sense that it exhibits a measurable amount of geodetic precession ( damour & ruffini 1974 ; barker & oconnell 1975a , b ; esposito & harrison 1975 ) .",
    "the effect occurs if the pulsar spin axis is misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector . in this case",
    ", a coupling of the vectors causes a precession of the pulsar spin around the orbital momentum . as a result ,",
    "the angle between spin axis and our line - of - sight will change with time , so that different portions of the emission beam are observed . consequently",
    ", one expects changes in the measured pulse shape as a function of time .",
    "weisberg , romani & taylor ( 1989 , hereafter wrt89 ) , reported a change in the relative amplitude of the prominent leading and trailing components in the pulse profile of psr b1913 + 16 . analyzing observations",
    "made at 1408 mhz in a time interval from 1981 to 1987 they determined a change in the amplitude ratio of @xmath2% yr@xmath3 , leading to a secular weakening of the leading component .",
    "if the emission beam exhibits an overall hollow - cone shape , one would also expect a change in the _ separation _ of the two components rather than only a change in relative intensity .",
    "this was , however , not observed within an upper limit of @xmath4 for the given time interval . as an interpretation ,",
    "wrt89 argue that geodetic precession alters the observer s cut through an irregular and patchy emission beam structure , similar to that proposed by lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) .",
    "cordes , wasserman & blaskiewicz ( 1990 , hereafter cwb90 ) used polarization data of psr b1913 + 16 to compare waveforms and position angle ( pa ) swings which were obtained at slightly different frequencies between 1397 and 1416 mhz between 1985 and 1988 . in the classical polar cap model the pa swing depends on the impact parameter of our line of sight ( radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ) , so that geodetic precession should alter the swing .",
    "while cwb90 detected a only possible change in the waveform , they could not find any significant change in the pa swing . in order to reconcile their observations with those of wrt89",
    ", they argue that while geodetic precession is acting , the existence of a core component , which is more prominent at lower frequencies ( cf .",
    "taylor et al .  1979 ) , is affecting the otherwise uniform hollow cone structure and the stability of the component ratio .    in the following we present new observations of psr b1913 + 16 and propose a model giving an estimate of the misalignment angle between pulsar spin axis and orbital momentum .",
    "such angle is particularly useful to constrain the progenitor system and the asymmetry of the second supernova explosion ( e.g.  cordes & wasserman 1984 , burrows & woosley 1986 ) . in sec .",
    "[ obs ] we describe our observations and the analysis of the data which we model in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we discuss our results in sec .  [ discus ] and draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the observations were made on six epochs between april 1994 and april 1998 , using the 100-m effelsberg radiotelescope of the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie .",
    "we used a tunable 1.3/1.7-ghz - hemt receiver installed in the prime focus yielding a system temperature of 2535 k on the cold sky with a telescope gain of 1.5 k / jy .",
    "the system provided left and right hand circularly polarized signals which were centered on 1410 mhz .",
    "full detail of the observing system can be found in kramer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "apart from a variation in observing time between 30 to 60 min depending on interstellar scintillation , each of the incoherently de - dispersed data sets was obtained and analyzed in a homogeneous way .",
    "total power profiles were produced by gain calibrating and summing the two circularly polarized intensities .",
    "these profiles were smoothed to match the dispersion smearing across one filterbank channel , resulting in an effective time resolution of 337 @xmath5s compared to a sampling time of 57.6 @xmath5s ( cf .",
    "[ profile ] ) .",
    "the effective time resolution of our data is about a factor of 2.5 worse than that of the data presented by wrt89 , but about a factor of 1.6 better than cwb90 .",
    "since our data are at the same center frequency ( i.e.  within 0.1% ) and have similar time resolution as wrt89 and cwb90 , we can accurately compare our data set to the previous observations .    at first , we measured the amplitude ratio of the leading and trailing components using the off - pulse rms as an uncertainty estimator .",
    "these are presented in fig",
    ".  [ ratio ] , where we also plot data from wrt89 .",
    "it is seen that the new data are in good agreement with the earlier measured trend . performing a weighted least - squares fit , we obtained a ratio change of @xmath6% per year .",
    "it is interesting to note that our fit is also in agreement with the component ratio from march 1978 ( fig .",
    "[ ratio ] ) , which was measured using the profile published by taylor & weisberg ( 1982 ) .",
    "the amplitude ratio between profile midpoint and trailing component seems to remain constant at a value of about 0.17 over a time span of 20 years within the errors .",
    "measuring the separation between the leading and trailing components , we followed the approach of wrt89 by fitting gaussian curves to the central portion of each component .",
    "the formal accuracy determined by the fit error can be up to an order of magnitude better than the sampling time , similar to a standard template matching procedure .",
    "we note , however , that the components are asymmetric in shape , so that the resulting centroids might be affected by the number of samples included in the fit around the peak . in order to estimate this effect as the true separation uncertainty",
    ", we performed fits including samples corresponding to intensity levels of down to 95% , 90% , 80% and 60% , respectively .",
    "the resulting mean values for the separation and their corresponding errors are presented in fig .",
    "[ widths ] with values adapted from wrt89 . in order to verify this approach we measured the component separation of the 1981 profile presented by wrt89 at corresponding intensity levels .",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath7 , in very good agreement with their value .",
    "this gives confidence in the consistency between our measurements and those of wrt89 .",
    "in what follows we will make two assumptions : a ) general relativity is the correct theory of gravitation within the uncertainties of our measurements ; and b ) the emission beam exhibits an overall circular hollow - cone like shape , with intensity possibly depending on magnetic longitude .",
    "the first assumption is obviously well justified , given the excellent agreement of the measured orbital decay with the prediction from general relativity ( taylor & weisberg 1982 , 1989 ) . while the assumption of an intensity dependence on magnetic longitude accounts for the component ratio change , the hollow - cone like shape follows the arguments given by cwb90 , which can now be based on even more data presented for slowly rotating pulsars ( e.g.  rankin 1993 , gil et al .",
    "1993 , kramer et al .",
    "1994 , gould 1994 ) .",
    "these data , derived from obviously random cuts through emission beams , indicate that the opening angle of the beam , @xmath8 , follows a period relation as expected for a circular beam in a dipolar field structure .",
    "recent results suggest that this is not true anymore for very fast rotating pulsars ( @xmath9ms ) but still applicable to psr b1913 + 16 ( kramer et al .",
    "1998 ) .    assumption ( a ) and the timing parameters presented by taylor ( 1992 ) imply an orbit inclination angle , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 , and an expected precession rate of @xmath12 yr@xmath3 ( barker & oconnell 1975a , b ) . modeling the effects of precession we use the same notation and coordinate system as introduced by cwb90 but",
    "define the precession phase @xmath13 such that @xmath14 describes the closest approach of the pulsar spin axis , @xmath15 , to the line - of - sight , @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ coordsys ] ) .",
    "note that our coordinate system represents the usual observers practice ( i.e.  pulsar - centered with z - axis anti - parallel to the angular momentum vector ) and thus differs from that described by damour & taylor ( 1992 ) , which is earth - centered with the primary axis along the line - of - sight . for a comparison , in fig .",
    "[ coordsys ] we refer to damour & taylor s definition of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "their fig .  1 ) .",
    "despite this difference , the misalignment angle , @xmath20 , between pulsar spin and orbital momentum is the same in both their and our convention .",
    "the angle between pulsar spin and line - of - sight , @xmath21 , will change with time according to @xmath22 affecting also the impact parameter , @xmath23 , i.e.  the angle between the magnetic axis , @xmath24 , and the line - of - sight at their closest approach .",
    "if the inclination angle between magnetic axis and pulsar spin axis is denoted by @xmath25 and the emission beam exhibits an opening angle , @xmath8 , the observed pulse width ( or component separation if @xmath8 is defined accordingly ) changes with time as @xmath26\\ ] ] using assumption ( b ) .",
    "obviously , only four free parameters describe the system discussed here , i.e.  @xmath25 , @xmath20 , @xmath14 and @xmath8 . in order to determine them , we fitted the measured component separations to the equations above .",
    "first we started a robust simplex least - squares fit algorithm ( e.g.  caceci & cacheris 1984 ) on grid positions covering the whole parameter space ( i.e.  @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , treating @xmath8 as a free parameter .",
    "however , due to wrt89 s very precise measurements , @xmath8 can be essentially fixed after calculating @xmath21 and @xmath31 for chosen values of @xmath25 , @xmath20 , @xmath14 and a component separation measured in 1981 .",
    "the @xmath32-hypersphere was thus searched on a finer grid in the remaining three dimensions .",
    "both methods yield the same results with a best reduced @xmath33 and 8 degrees - of - freedom .",
    "this relatively large @xmath32-value suggests that some of the separation uncertainties are underestimated .",
    "nevertheless , the minimum is well constrained as shown by the 68% , 90% and 99% confidence contours ( fig .",
    "[ contours ] ) and confirmed by monte - carlo simulations . however , since the orbit inclination angle can be either @xmath10 or @xmath34 , four equivalent solutions exist which are listed in table  [ solutions ] ( note that the angles are related to each other by a 180@xmath35-ambiguity ) .",
    "quoted uncertainties represent 99% confidence limits . as we discuss in detail below",
    ", we consider solution iii as the correct one .",
    "we observe a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the leading component , which is apparently caused by geodetic precession ( cf .",
    "wrt89 , cwb90 ) .",
    "while the amplitude ratio of the trailing component to the profile midpoint seems to remain unchanged , flux density variations due to interstellar scintillation prevent a conclusion whether the profile has weakened as a whole .",
    "nevertheless , the observed amplitude change strongly suggests a latitudinal dependence of the emission strength .",
    "this is not too surprising as , e.g. , dependencies of the spectral index on the distance to the magnetic axis have been observed before ( e.g.  lyne & manchester 1988 , kramer et al .",
    "the case of psr b1913 + 16 is however unique as such dependence can be seen for a single pulsar . assuming the model parameters in table  [ solutions ] , the impact parameter has changed by about @xmath36 between 1981 and 1998 .",
    "this corresponds to about 20% of the determined opening angle , which seems a realistic value for the given amplitude change .",
    "although the beam is thus not uniformly filled , this does not contradict the assumption about a circular beam shape .",
    "in fact , cwb90 show that the core component which lags the profile midpoint significantly , can disturb a possible uniformity of the beam .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1979 ) had argued similarly based on reported profile changes at 430 mhz .",
    "later , however , they attributed the effect to a comparison of data obtained with a different number of polarization channels ( taylor & weisberg 1982 ) .",
    "we thus believe that the simple assumption of a circular hollow - cone like beam shape is well justified .",
    "since we have determined the system geometry without using polarization data , we can actually compare our results with those determined using polarization observations by cwb90 and blaskiewicz , cordes , & wassmerman ( 1991 , hereafter bcw91 ) .",
    "using the same observer s convention as cwb90 and bcw91 , we can make this comparison directly without a necessary transformation of the involved angles as it would be necessary when using damour & taylor s ( 1992 ) convention .",
    "computing the impact parameter @xmath31 for the observing epochs of cwb90 and bcw91 , we note that solutions i and iv yield a negative value , while solutions ii and iii give a positive impact angle . both cwb90 and bcw91 present pa curves which are well defined over a wide range of longitudes ( @xmath37 ) , exhibiting a positive slope with a flattening at pulse longitudes separated from the profile midpoint by more than @xmath38 .",
    "this behaviour clearly indicates a positive impact parameter , i.e. an outer line - of - sight ( narayan & vivekanand 1982 , lyne & manchester 1988 ) , so that we can exclude the first and fourth solutions .",
    "the remaining ones differ in particular in the value of the misalignment angle .",
    "while solution iii indicates an almost aligned system , solution iv implies almost anti - parallel spins .",
    "such a retrograde spin requires an asymmetric kick during the second supernova explosion which has to be much greater than the pre - supernova orbital velocity of the pulsar ( e.g.  hills 1983 , kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) . following the calculations of hills ( 1983 ) or freyer & kalogera ( 1997 )",
    ", this would imply a kick velocity of about 500 km s@xmath3 , which is in conflict with freyer & kalogera s estimate of about 200 km s@xmath3 as the most probable value .",
    "such large kicks are also hard to reconcile with the ( transverse ) system velocity of psr b1913 + 16 of about 130 km s@xmath3 ( taylor & weisberg 1989 ) .",
    "hence , we reject this solution and consider model iii as the one describing the data best .",
    "although we are confident in the consistency between our and wrt89 s data , we now discuss the possibility that the comparison of data which were obtained with different observing systems , can bear some uncertainties .",
    "obviously , we minimized possible effects by using very similar observing parameters and an identical data analysis procedure as wrt89 .",
    "we can nevertheless study remaining uncertainties assuming even larger measurement errors than estimated .",
    "the best solutions listed in table  [ solutions ] predict that the pa swing steepens with time , while a sign change in the impact parameter will occur in the near future ( or has already occured recently ) . with increased measurement errors , solutions are allowed ( e.g.  @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) where the impact parameter has changed sign prior to the observations of cwb90 , so that it will remain positive with less steep pa swings .",
    "studies of various @xmath32-hyperspheres , however , indicate that the most interesting parameter , @xmath20 , will most likely remain in a range @xmath41 .    using model iii to compute the change in the impact angle , @xmath31 , between cwb90 s observing epochs",
    ", we derive a change of @xmath42 , which is only slightly higher than their estimated detection limit .",
    "following also the discussion by cwb90 that the core component affects the pa curve , it is thus not surprising that they were not able to detect a change .",
    "in fact , the authors argue that the impact parameter should be much smaller than implied by their measured slope of the pa swing , which is also consistent with our result . following the arguments of cwb90 , bcw91 excluded the central portion of the pa curve , when they fitted a ( relativistic ) radhakrishnan - cooke ( 1969 ) model to measured pas of psr b1913 + 16 . at 1403 mhz they obtained @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which is indeed in good agreement with model iii .",
    "our results imply a misalignment of the pulsar spin to the orbital momentum vector of @xmath45 .",
    "such value is in agreement with early simulations made by bailes ( 1988 ) who found @xmath46 as a typical value for psr b1913 + 16 like systems .",
    "the model also implies that the component separation remains almost unchanged for about 60 yr , which corresponds to a likelihood of 20% to observe the pulsar in that phase given a precession period of about 300 yr .",
    "thus , it is easy to understand why wrt89 did not detect any change in the component separation .",
    "we have analyzed new observations of psr b1913 + 16 , showing that the first component has weakened by about 40% since 1978 . for the first time we detected a small change in component separation , which we modeled assuming geodetic precession and a circular hollow - cone like beam .",
    "if our model is correct , the change of the component separation should be easily measurable in future high signal - to - noise ratio observations as it will decrease with a higher rate .",
    "a test is also provided by monitoring the pa curve whose slope will possibly change sign in the near future .    due to geodetic precession , the pulsar will not beam towards earth for a significant fraction of its lifetime .",
    "in fact , our proposed model predicts that psr b1913 + 16 will not be observable anymore after the year @xmath472025 . shortly before this , the leading component will disappear if it continues to weaken with the measured rate .",
    "reappearing again around the year 2220 , psr b1913 + 16 will , in total , only be observable for about a third of the precession period ( cf .",
    "[ widths ] ) . while this does not affect birth rate calculations of double neutron star systems , the relatively small inferred ( two - pole ) beaming fraction of about 0.35 should be considered in future calculations .",
    "so far , we have assumed that general relativity is the correct theory of gravitation in order to calculate the precession rate . with more and better data",
    ", we can treat the precession rate as a free parameter , so that the performance of another test for general relativity will be possible .",
    "while timing observations are not able to decide between the `` true '' orbital inclination angle , our final model suggests that its value is @xmath34 rather than @xmath10 .",
    "while polarization data provide information of the system in the two dimensions of the projected sky , geodetic precession and its observed effects yield information in direction of our line - of - sight .",
    "combining all the available information allows to draw a three dimensional picture and to the remove the ambiguity in the orbital inclination angle of psr b1913 + 16 for the first time .",
    "it is clear that a misalignment angle of @xmath45 requires an asymmetric kick during the second supernova explosion .",
    "an asymmetric kick has been already inferred for j0045@xmath487319 ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) and has been argued for b1913 + 16 on basis of evolutionary models ( e.g.  wijers et al .",
    "1992 , van den heuvel & van paradijs 1997 , fryer & kalogera 1997 ) .",
    "our observations provide direct evidence for this hypothesis and give a natural explanation for the large inferred birth verlocities of pulsars ( e.g.  lyne & lorimer 1993 ) .",
    "i am indebted to all people involved in the project to monitor millisecond pulsars in effelsberg , in particular to kiriaki xilouris , christoph lange , dunc lorimer and axel jessner . during this work i enjoyed stimulating discussions with norbert wex and duncan lorimer , who also read the manuscript with great care .",
