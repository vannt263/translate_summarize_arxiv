    "complete integrability in the classical framework has been associated with the existence of alternative hamiltonian descriptions . as a matter of fact ,",
    "integrability of a given dynamical system admitting alternative hamiltonian descriptions is usually implied by the compatibility of the two hamiltonian structures , when they are generic .    because quantum theory is considered to be more fundamental than the classical one , one usually expects that quantum systems , whose corresponding classical limits are completely integrable ,",
    "should admit alternative quantum descriptions .",
    "recently , some alternative `` quantum structures '' have been identified as alternative hermitian structures on the vector space of physical states in the schroedinger picture,@xcite or as alternative associative products on the space of observables in the heisenberg picture.@xcite in some of previous papers the notion of mutually compatible alternative structures has been analyzed to find out how many different dynamical systems may be bi - hamiltonian with respect to two given structures .",
    "it is usually stated that the schroedinger picture and the heisenberg picture are equivalent . in this paper",
    ", we would like to consider those alternative structures in the heisenberg picture which correspond to the alternative hermitian structures which we find in the schroedinger picture .",
    "more generally , when a dynamical system is identified with a derivation of suitable products , we would like to consider the existence of alternative and mutually compatible algebraic structures on the same carrier space . in some sense",
    ", we use the notion of compatibility for poisson brackets as a guiding idea to define a notion of compatibility for algebraic structures admitting a common derivation .",
    "moreover , a systematic formulation of quantum mechanics on quaternionic hilbert spaces exists @xcite and , in the last few years , there have been some suggestions that quaternionic quantum mechanics ( qqm ) may be useful to classify positive maps in standard quantum mechanics.@xcite thus , we introduce the notion of compatible quaternionic quantum bi - hamiltonian dynamical systems and discuss their schroedinger and heisenberg representations .",
    "it is possible a discussion of both the standard and quaternionic formulation of quantum mechanics in a unified conceptual framework arising from a geometrization of quantum mechanics . roughly speaking ,",
    "it is possible to start with a real differential manifold @xmath0 as carrier space , instead of the hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "then operators acting on @xmath2 may be associated with ( 1 - 1)-tensors acting on the tangent space @xmath3 , and the coefficients of such tensor fields at each point may be in turn real , or complex or even quaternionic numbers .",
    "in other words , only the coefficients of ( 1 - 1)-tensor fields are complex valued or quaternionic valued functions , while the carrier space @xmath0  remains a real differential manifold .",
    "in this section we discuss the relevant geometric structures which appear in standard quantum mechanics and the relations among them , in the framework of our geometrization.@xcite    to avoid technicalities , for the time being , while we deal with general aspects , we shall confine ourselves to finite dimensional carrier spaces .",
    "we start with a complex hilbert space @xmath1 and consider its realification @xmath4 in other words , given a basis \\{@xmath5 } , any vector @xmath6 will be replaced by its complex components @xmath7 in @xmath1 and with real components @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "now let the real vector space @xmath10 considered as a contractible real manifold @xmath11 be equipped with a symplectic structure @xmath12 a non - degenerate 2-form such that @xmath13 then @xmath14 is even , say @xmath15 a global darboux chart @xmath16 endows @xmath0 with a real linear structure @xmath17the infinitesimal generator of dilation ( often also called the liouville vector field or the euler operator ) whose tensorial expression is provided by @xmath18    in this chart , we define a linearly admissible complex structure , i.e. a ( 1 - 1 ) tensor field @xmath19  commuting with @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . then construct a tensor@xmath22 as @xmath23 the triple @xmath24 is ( linearly ) admissible if @xmath22 results an euclidean metric tensor in a global darboux chart .",
    "this generalizes the definition of admissible triple @xmath25 we have given in ref .",
    "it is also possible to construct a ( linearly ) admissible triple @xmath25 starting from @xmath22 and @xmath26 following the lines of ref .",

    "then , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are connected by the linear structure @xmath36@xmath42 and are both homogeneous of degree zero , i.e. @xmath43 while the correspondence @xmath44 is a full associative algebra and a corresponding lie algebra isomorphism , the correspondence @xmath45 is instead only a lie algebra ( anti)isomorphism , that is @xmath46 while @xmath47=-x_{[a , b]}.\\ ] ] moreover , for any @xmath48 @xmath49}.   \\label{tensorcost}\\ ] ] equation ( [ tensorcost ] ) allows for the definition of constant tensors : a tensor @xmath50 is constant with respect to the linear structure @xmath20 when @xmath51    we recall that an hermitian tensor @xmath52  on @xmath53 can be defined as a map : @xmath54 such that @xmath55 are respectively a real valued and a purely imaginary valued quadratic function of real variables .",
    "we shall use the real quadratic function @xmath56 as the hamiltonian generating function of the field @xmath57 : @xmath58 it would have been possible to start with @xmath19 and @xmath22  to recover @xmath28 by means of the exterior derivative associated with @xmath59@xcite indeed , with the help of @xmath60 the symplectic structure is recovered through @xmath61    it is possible to show that @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "indeed the following tensor @xmath107@xmath108 written for simplicity in mixed coordinates , maps one linear structure nto the other : @xmath109    the existence of these two alternative linear structures means that we may compose ( add ) solutions for @xmath57 in alternative ways to get new solutions .",
    "the fact that these linear structures are not linearly related means that the image of the composition ( sum ) is not the composition ( sum ) of the images.@xcite",
    "in general , two symplectic structures associated with a classical bi - hamiltonian system do not admit a common darboux chart .",
    "when they are `` constant '' in the same global darboux chart , one can find a linear transformation ( that is , a diffeomorphism commuting with @xmath20 ) which connects the two symplectic structures .",

    "quantum theory in the usual schroedinger formulation , when we start from a given schroedinger dynamics , leads quite naturally to consider identical complex structures in the two triples and the condition @xmath113 is a sufficient condition for compatibility @xcite . on the contrary , in the real context it is possible to consider the case of two admissible triples with @xmath114 which are compatible @xcite .",

    "in this case @xmath120 is diagonalizable and the two hermitian structures result proportional in each eigenspace of @xmath120 _ via _ the eigenvalue .",
