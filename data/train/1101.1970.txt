    "the apparent ubiquity of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the spheroidal components of present - day galaxies and the correlation between the masses of smbhs and spheroidal stars @xcite indicate that active galactic nucleus ( agn ; smbh - driven activity ) and starburst activity are closely coupled .",
    "theories also predict that starburst activity in the nuclear region of a galaxy can have a strong effect on a central agn by regulating the mass accretion rate of a central smbh @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to observationally ascertain whether , in what types of galaxies , and on which physical scale agn and starburst activity are related .    to disentangle agn and starburst activity in galaxies ,",
    "it is essential to use an indicator that can trace _ only _ starburst or agn activity .",
    "an effective tool for detecting starburst activity is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features found in the infrared 320 @xmath1 m wavelength range @xcite . in a starburst galaxy , pahs in the photo - dissociation regions",
    "are excited without destruction by far - uv photons from stars , and so a starburst galaxy usually exhibits strong pah emission features @xcite .",
    "however , in the near vicinity of an agn , pahs are destroyed due to strong x - ray radiation emanating from the agn @xcite . in the obscuring material surrounding a central agn , pah molecules at some distance from the agn",
    "could be adequately shielded from such x - ray emission by gas and dust and could survive .",
    "however , no pah - exciting uv photons from the agn are available there , as the extinction rate is greater in the uv range than in the x - ray range , and thus , pah emission is absent from a pure agn . if pah emission is detected in a galaxy hosting an agn , pah - exciting uv photons from local energy sources ( i.e. , starbursts ) are required .",
    "thus , pah emission is a very useful tool for detecting only starburst activity and investigating its properties by removing the contamination from an agn , even in an agn / starburst composite galaxy . more importantly , since dust extinction is small at @xmath3 3 @xmath1 m ( @xmath20.05 @xmath4 a@xmath5 ; nishiyama et al . 2008 ; 2009 ) , the absolute magnitude of modestly - obscured ( a@xmath5 @xmath2 20 mag ) starburst activity is reasonably quantifiable from the _ observed _ ( extinction-_uncorrected _ ) pah emission luminosity @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", infrared 320 @xmath1 m spectroscopy can be very effective for directly ascertaining agn ",
    "starburst connections in galaxies in a quantitatively reliable manner .    using the pah emission features detected in the space - based spitzer irs observations @xcite , agn  starburst connections in",
    "optically identified agns have been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "however , the large aperture of the spitzer irs ( @xmath63@xmath76 ) probes not only nuclear ( @xmath2a few kpc ) starbursts , but also spatially extended ( @xmath6several kpc ) star - forming regions in host galaxies .",
    "although spatially extended star formation may be more quiescent than nuclear starbursts , it can dominate the total pah emission flux in large - aperture spectroscopy because of its large surface area . with regard to possible connections between agns and starbursts ,",
    "however , it is likely that _ nuclear _ starbursts have a stronger influence on an agn due to the proximity to a central smbh .",
    "the greater importance of _ nuclear _ starbursts ( rather than spatially extended star - formation ) to central agns was actually argued from observations @xcite , suggesting that it is important to observationally investigate the relationship between _ nuclear _ starbursts and agns .",
    "ground - based , narrow - slit ( @xmath81  ) spectroscopy is better suited to detecting exclusively _ nuclear _ ( @xmath2a few kpc ) starbursts by reducing the contamination from spatially extended ( @xmath6several kpc ) , quiescent star - forming activity in host galaxies .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature is particularly useful for probing exclusively nuclear starbursts via ground - based slit spectroscopy , as it is in an appropriate wavelength range for terrestrial atmospheric transmission ( i.e. , @xmath0-band ; 2.84.2 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "although a strong 11.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature is also observable from the ground , the earth s atmospheric background level in the @xmath9-band ( 813 @xmath1 m ) is much higher than that in the @xmath0-band , making it more difficult to obtain spectra with sufficient s / n ratios around the 11.3 @xmath1 m pah emission .    using the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission features detected in ground - based , narrow - slit spectra",
    ", the relationship between agns and _ nuclear _ starbursts was observationally investigated in the nearby seyfert galaxies ( a moderate - luminosity agn population ) , and a positive luminosity correlation was found @xcite .",
    "@xcite has extended these results to low - luminosity agns and has confirmed that a similar correlation is valid in this case .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the agn  nuclear - starburst connection holds in a high - luminosity agn population , as theoretical predictions about agn  nuclear - starburst connections are varied , and are sometimes contradictory .",
    "for example , @xcite predicted that the nuclear - starburst - to - agn luminosity ratio will increase with increasing agn luminosity , whereas @xcite has argued the contrary .",
    "observations of high - luminosity agns are needed to resolve this issue .    in this paper , we present the results of ground - based , narrow - slit spectroscopy of pg qsos @xcite , a higher - luminosity agn population than the seyfert galaxies in the local universe . throughout this paper , @xmath10 @xmath11 75 km s@xmath12",

    ", we set a declination limit of @xmath1615@xmath18 @xmath8 @xmath1965@xmath18 to facilitate observation with small airmass at mauna kea , hawaii ( our observation site ) .",
    "this selection resulted in ten high - luminosity pg qsos at @xmath20 0.17 ( table 1 ) , all of which were observed .    because the number of low - luminosity pg qsos is larger ,",
    "a more stringent declination limit of @xmath1615@xmath18 @xmath8 @xmath1955@xmath18 was imposed .",

    "our sample is statistically complete , and hence is useful for investigating general properties without any obvious selection bias .",
    "the redshift range is 0.0610.167 , where 1  corresponds to the physical scale of 1.12.7 kpc .",
    "we used the ircs infrared spectrograph @xcite at the nasmyth focus of the subaru telescope @xcite to obtain the new infrared @xmath0-band spectra of the pg qsos , with the exception of mrk 1014 , 3c 273 , and i zw 1 , for which the irtf telescope was used .",

    "the sky was clear .",
    "the seeing size in the @xmath21-band ( @xmath22 = 2.2 @xmath1 m ) , obtained from images taken prior to the @xmath0-band spectroscopy , was 0@xmath740@xmath78 in fwhm . the 0@xmath79-wide slit and @xmath0-grism were used with a 52-mas - pixel scale .",
    "the achievable spectral resolution was r @xmath8 140 at @xmath23 3.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "the precipitable water was very low , 12 mm for the 2006 july and 2010 april observational runs , and @xmath21 mm for the 2007 january run .",
    "we adopted a standard telescope nodding technique ( abba pattern ) with a throw of 7  along the slit to subtract background emission .",
    "we used the optical guider of the subaru telescope to monitor the telescope tracking .",
    "the exposure time was 1.01.8 sec , and 3060 coadds were employed at each nod position .",
    "the ircs was moved from the cassegrain to the nasmyth focus of the subaru telescope in 2005 .",
    "afterward , the background level was high in the @xmath0-band because of the high emissivity of the nasmyth image rotator .",
    "in 2008 , the image rotator was recoated , and the resulting low background level enabled a higher achievable sensitivity in the 2010 april data than in the 20062007 data . hence , for objects of the same apparent magnitude observed with the same exposure time , the data quality of the 2010 spectra is generally superior to that of the 20062007 spectra .    for all observational runs , f- or g - type main sequence stars ( table 1 )",
    "were observed as standard stars , with a mean airmass difference of @xmath20.1 compared with the individual pg qsos , to correct for terrestrial atmospheric transmission and provide flux calibration .",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitudes of the standard stars were estimated from their @xmath24-band ( @xmath25 0.6 @xmath1 m ) magnitudes , adopting the @xmath26 colors appropriate for the stellar types of the individual standard stars @xcite .",
    "standard data analysis procedures were employed using iraf .",
    "initially , frames taken with an a ( or b ) beam were subtracted from frames subsequently taken with a b ( or a ) beam , and the resulting subtracted frames were added and divided by a spectroscopic flat image .",
    "bad pixels and pixels impacted by cosmic rays were then replaced with the interpolated values of the surrounding pixels . finally , the spectra of the pg qsos and the standard stars were extracted .",
    "the wavelength calibration was based on wavelength - dependent terrestrial atmospheric transmission .",
    "the spectra of the pg qsos were divided by the observed spectra of the standard stars and were multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures appropriate to the individual standard stars ( table 1 ) .",
    "the flux calibration was based on the signals from the pg qsos and the standard stars detected inside our slit spectra . seeing sizes in the @xmath21-band ( and @xmath0-band ) were always smaller than the employed slit widths , and the tracking performance of the subaru telescope was already established .",
    "we thus expected that the possible slit loss for the compact emission would be insignificant . to reduce the scatter of the spectra , appropriate binning of spectral elements",

    "only the spectra in the range @xmath27 = 3.43.9 @xmath1 m are shown , as ( 1 ) the data for @xmath27 @xmath2 3.4 @xmath1 m generally exhibit large scatter due to the strong wavelength dependency of terrestrial atmospheric transmission , and ( 2 ) the data for @xmath27 @xmath6 3.9 @xmath1 m are noisier owing to the increased terrestrial atmospheric background emission .",
    "this treatment is necessary to better visualize the possible signatures of weak 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission features in pg qsos .",
    "photometry at 3.7 @xmath1 m with a 55@xmath75 aperture can be found in the literature for many of the observed pg qsos @xcite , and our flux estimates roughly agree with the photometric flux measurements in most cases , suggesting that ( 1 ) the infrared 34 @xmath1 m emission is dominated by a spatially - compact component , and ( 2 ) the slit loss in our slit spectra is generally insignificant .",
    "unlike the seyfert galaxies , which contain both type 1 unobscured and type 2 obscured agns @xcite , the high - luminosity agn sample is well established only for type 1 unobscured agns @xcite . for pg qsos",
    "( = type 1 unobscured agns ) , the unattenuated featureless continuum emission originating from an agn reduces the equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission originating from a starburst . consequently , even for the pg qsos with 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission signatures , the pah flux excess above the continuum level is small , making it difficult to trace the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission profile in detail .",

    "the detection rate of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature is only 17% (= 5/30 ) for pg qsos , suggesting that the relative contribution from starburst emission is generally weak in the 34 @xmath1 m range when compared with the continuum emission originating from an agn .",
    "this is what we expected , as signs of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature are not obvious in the composite spectrum of sdss qsos ( = high - luminosity , optically selected , type 1 unobscured agns ) @xcite .",

    "we here regard that the detected pah emission toward the nuclear directions of pg qsos is dominated by starburst activity in the true _ nuclear regions _ , rather than just a small fraction of spatially - extended star - forming activity , which happens to occur at the foreground of the nuclear directions , but is physically far away from the agn nuclei , for the following reason .",
    "our pg qso sample is optically classified as type-1 unobscured agns , and so agn obscuration is very small in the optical .",
    "stars are formed from molecular gas , where dust usually coexists .",
    "if a large amount of star - forming activity in an extended host galaxy s disk is present in front of the nuclear agn direction , such a galaxy would not be classified as a type-1 agn in the optical .",
    "hence , the inclination of extended star - forming disks in our pg qso sample must be biased to face - on @xcite , where the contamination from star - forming activity at a large physical distance from the nuclei , to the observed nuclear spectra , is minimal .",
    "figure 5 compares the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission luminosity ( ordinate ) and the @xmath30 = 3.35 @xmath1 m continuum luminosity in @xmath22l@xmath31 ( abscissa ) for pg qsos .",
    "the ordinate and abscissa trace the nuclear - starburst and agn - heated hot dust luminosities , respectively .",
    "the five pah - detected pg qsos are superimposed on the data points by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "figure 5 shows that ( 1 ) the data points of the pg qsos are distributed in a higher agn luminosity range compared with the seyfert galaxies previously studied by @xcite and @xcite , and ( 2 ) the nuclear - starburst - to - agn luminosity ratios of pg qsos are similar to or possibly higher than those of seyfert galaxies ( = lower - luminosity agns ) . the hypothesis that the nuclear - starburst - to - agn luminosity ratio decreases with increasing agn luminosity @xcite is therefore not supported . if the apparently higher ratio in pg qsos is real , the model developed by @xcite may be preferable , but more detailed discussions are difficult with our currently available dataset .    to compare seyfert galaxies and pg qsos",
    ", it should be noted that the agn - heated hot dust emission luminosities for seyferts are derived from @xmath9-band ( 10 @xmath1 m ) continuum luminosities , whereas those for pg qsos are obtained from @xmath0-band ( 3.35 @xmath1 m ) continuum luminosities .",
    "the reasons for this are as follows : ( 1 ) unlike the case for seyfert galaxies , for which @xmath9-band photometric measurements with small ( @xmath212  ) apertures are available for many sources ( e.g. , gorjian et al .",
    "2004 ) , such measurements are not available for the observed pg qsos .",
    "( 2 ) only type 1 unobscured agns are included in the pg qso sample , so that dust extinction effects are not a serious concern at wavelengths shorter than the @xmath9-band .",
    "both @xmath0- and @xmath9-band continuum luminosities trace the agn - heated hot dust emission .",
    "however , the shorter @xmath0-band wavelength preferentially probes the hotter dust closer to the central mass - accreting smbh at the inner part of the dusty torus compared with the longer @xmath9-band wavelength .",
    "if the solid angle of the dusty torus , viewed from the central smbh , does not vary with the distance from the smbh , then the @xmath0- and @xmath9-band continuum luminosities should be similar , as the luminosity ratio of the intrinsic energetic radiation of the agn to the agn - heated hot dust luminosity depends only on the covering factor of the dusty torus .",
    "however , if the torus is flared @xcite or warped @xcite , the agn - originated @xmath9-band - to-@xmath0-band luminosity ratio could be greater than unity .",
    "if this is the case , the true distribution of pg qsos should move to the right relative to the current plots .",
    "although this is a possible ambiguity , we do not expect it to be significant , as both the @xmath0- and @xmath9-band continua probe relatively hot dust ( @xmath81000k and @xmath8300k , respectively ) at the inner part of the dusty torus , and thus , the effects of possible torus flaring / warping should be smaller than with more widely separated wavelengths such as @xmath0-band and @xmath620 @xmath1 m ( which probes cooler dust ) . in fact , we compared the 3.7 @xmath1 m and 10.1 @xmath1 m continuum luminosities ( @xmath22l@xmath31 ) measured with a @xmath85  aperture for pg qsos with available measurements of this type @xcite , but could find no evidence that the 10.1 @xmath1 m continuum luminosity is systematically larger by a factor of @xmath62 than the 3.7 @xmath1 m continuum luminosity .    finally , the bolometric luminosity of nuclear starbursts can be roughly estimated from the observed 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission luminosity using the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah - to - infrared luminosity ratio of @xmath810@xmath38 for starbursts @xcite and assuming that infrared luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity in starbursts . to derive the agn bolometric luminosity from the @xmath0-band continuum luminosity ( @xmath22l@xmath31 or @xmath39l@xmath40 ) ,",
    "we adopt a correction factor of 5 @xcite .",
    "the dotted line in figure 5 represents the nuclear - starburst - to - agn bolometric luminosity ratio of 0.1 .",
    "based on the assumption that starburst - driven turbulence controls the mass accretion of a central smbh , @xcite argued that the nuclear - starburst - to - agn luminosity ratio tends to increase with increasing final supermassive black hole mass ( m@xmath41 ) , and the ratio can be @xmath60.1 if the mass is @xmath610@xmath42m@xmath43 .",

    "<S> we present the results of infrared @xmath0-band ( 34 @xmath1 m ) slit spectroscopy of 30 pg qsos at z @xmath2 0.17 , the representative sample of local high - luminosity , optically selected agns . the 3.3 @xmath1 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature is used to probe nuclear ( @xmath2a few kpc ) starburst activity and to investigate the connections between agns and nuclear starbursts in pg qsos . the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission is detected in the individual spectra of 5/30 of the observed pg qsos . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a composite spectrum of pah - undetected pg qsos and discern the presence of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission therein . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the nuclear - starburst and agn luminosities from the observed 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission and 3.35 @xmath1 m continuum luminosities , respectively , and find that the nuclear - starburst - to - agn luminosity ratios in pg qsos are similar to those of previously studied agn populations with lower luminosities , suggesting that agn  nuclear starburst connections are valid over the wide luminosity range of agns in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the observed nuclear - starburst - to - agn luminosity ratios in pg qsos with available supermassive black hole masses are comparable to a theoretical prediction based on the assumption that the growth of a supermassive black hole is controlled by starburst - induced turbulence . </S>"
