    "neutrino energy transfer to the matter adjacent to the nascent neutron star is supposed to trigger the explosion of a massive star ( @xmath1 ) as a type ii supernova .",
    "since the energy released in neutrinos by the collapsed stellar iron core is more than 100 times larger than the kinetic energy of the explosion , only a small fraction of the neutrino energy is sufficient to expel the mantle and envelope of the progenitor star .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated the viability of this neutrino - driven explosion mechanism ( wilson  @xcite ; bethe & wilson  @xcite ; wilson  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) but the explosions turned out to be sensitive to the size of the neutrino luminosities and the neutrino spectra ( janka  @xcite ; janka & mller  @xcite ; burrows & goshy  @xcite ) both of which determine the power of the neutrino energy transfer to the matter outside the average neutrinosphere .",
    "the rate of energy deposition per nucleon via the dominant processes of electron neutrino absorption on neutrons and electron antineutrino absorption on protons is given by : @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the number fractions of free neutrons and protons , respectively ; the normalization with the baryon density @xmath5 indicates that the rate per baryon is calculated in eq .",

    "@xmath6 denotes the luminosity of either @xmath7 or @xmath8 in units of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the radial position in @xmath11 .",
    "the average of the squared neutrino energy , @xmath12 , is measured in units of @xmath13 and enters through the energy dependence of the neutrino and antineutrino absorption cross sections .",
    "@xmath14 is the angular dilution factor of the neutrino radiation field ( the `` flux factor '' , which is equal to the mean value of the cosine of the angle of neutrino propagation relative to the radial direction ) which varies between values much less than unity deep inside the protoneutron star atmosphere , about 0.25 around the neutrinosphere , and 1 for radially streaming neutrinos very far out .",
    "the factor @xmath14 determines the local neutrino energy density according to the relation @xmath15 and thus enters the heating rate of eq .",

    "emitting star , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 dilutes like @xmath18 .",
    "although it was found in two - dimensional simulations that convective instabilities in the neutrino - heating region can help the explosion ( herant  et  al .",

    "@xcite ; miller  et  al .",
    "@xcite ; shimizu  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) by the exchange of hot gas from the heating layer with cold gas from the postshock region , the strength of this convective overturn and its importance for the explosion is still a matter of debate ( janka & mller  @xcite , mezzacappa  et  al .",
    "@xcite , lichtenstadt et al .",
    "in addition , it turns out that the development of an explosion remains sensitive to the neutrino luminosities and the mean spectral energies even if convective overturn lowers the required threshold values .",
    "this is the case because convective instabilities can develop sufficiently quickly only when the heating is fast and an unstable stratification builds up more quickly than the heated matter is advected from the postshock region through the gain radius ( which is the radius separating neutrino cooling inside from neutrino heating outside ) down onto the neutron star surface ( janka & mller  @xcite , janka & keil  @xcite ) .",
    "`` robust '' neutrino - driven explosions might therefore require larger accretion luminosities ( to be precise : a larger value of the product @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) ) during the early post - bounce phase , or might call for enhanced neutrino emission from the core .",
    "the latter could be caused , for example , by convective neutrino transport within the nascent neutron star ( burrows  @xcite ; mayle & wilson  @xcite ; wilson & mayle  @xcite , @xcite ; keil  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) or , alternatively , by a suppression of the neutrino opacities at nuclear densities through nucleon correlations ( sawyer  @xcite ; horowitz & wehrberger  @xcite ; raffelt & seckel  @xcite ; raffelt  et  al .",

    "@xcite , @xcite ) , all of which have to date not been taken into account fully self - consistently in supernova simulations .",
    "the diffusive propagation of neutrinos out from the very opaque inner core is determined by the value of the diffusion constant and thus sensitive to these effects .    most of the current numerical treatments of neutrino transport , however , are deficient not only concerning their description of the extremely complex neutrino interactions in the dense nuclear plasma but also concerning their handling of the transition from diffusion to free streaming .",
    "while the core flux is fixed in the diffusive regime , the accretion luminosity as well as the spectra of the emitted neutrinos depend on the transport in the semitransparent layers around the sphere of last scattering .",
    "since neutrino - matter interactions are strongly dependent on the neutrino energy , neutrinos with different energies interact with largely different rates and decouple in layers with different densities and temperatures .",
    "the spectral shape of the emergent neutrino flux is therefore different from the thermal spectrum at any particular point in the atmosphere .",
    "even more , through the factor @xmath14 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) the energy deposition rate depends on the angular distribution of the neutrinos in the heating region .",
    "a quantitatively reliable description of these aspects requires the use of sophisticated transport algorithms which solve the boltzmann equation instead of approximate methods like flux - limited diffusion techniques ( janka  @xcite , @xcite ; mezzacappa & bruenn  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; messer  et  al .",
    "the detection of electron antineutrinos from sn  1987a in the kamiokande  ii ( hirata  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and imb laboratories ( bionta  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and the construction of new , even larger neutrino experiments for future supernova neutrino measurements have raised additional interest in accurate predictions of the detectable neutrino signals from type ii supernovae .",
    "neutrino transport in core collapse supernovae is a very complex problem and difficult to treat accurately even in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "some of the major difficulties arise from the strong energy dependence of the neutrino interactions , the non - conservative and anisotropic nature of the scattering processes such as neutrino - electron scattering , the non - linearity of the reaction kernels through neutrino fermi blocking , and the need to couple neutrino and antineutrino transport for the neutrino - pair reactions .",
    "therefore various simplifications and approximations have been employed in numerical simulations of supernova explosions and neutron star formation .",
    "the so far most widely used approximation with a high degree of sophistication is the ( multi - energy - group ) flux - limited diffusion ( mgfld ) ( bowers & wilson  @xcite , bruenn  @xcite , myra  et  al .",
    "@xcite , suzuki  @xcite , lichtenstadt et al .",
    "@xcite ) where a flux - limiting parameter is employed in the formulation of the neutrino flux to ensure a smooth interpolation between the diffusion regime ( where the neutrinos are essentially isotropic ) and the free streaming regime ( where the neutrinos move radially outward ) .",
    "although the limits are accurately reproduced , there is no guarantee that the intermediate regime is properly treated . since in a quasi - stationary situation ( e.g. , for the cooling protoneutron star )",
    "the flux and the mean energy of the emitted neutrinos are determined in the diffusion regime , little change of these is found when the flux - limiter is varied ( suzuki  @xcite ) or the transport equation is directly solved , e.g. , by monte carlo calculations ( janka  @xcite ) .",
    "this , however , is not true when the spectral form is considered , because the spectra are shaped in the semitransparent surface - near layers .",
    "moreover , significant differences are also expected for problems where the local angular distribution is important in the region between the diffusion and free streaming limits . due to the factor",
    "@xmath14 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) the hot - bubble heating is such a problem , neutrino - antineutrino pair annihilation is another problem of this kind .",
    "in fact , monte carlo simulations ( janka & hillebrandt  @xcite,@xcite ; janka  @xcite ; janka  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) have shown that all flux - limiters overestimate the anisotropy of the radiation field outside the neutrinosphere , i.e. , @xmath20 is enforced too rapidly ( see also cernohorsky & bludman  @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to an underestimation of the neutrino heating in the hot - bubble region between neutrinosphere and supernova shock",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) ) , and sensitivity of the supernova dynamics to the employed flux - limiting scheme must be expected ( messer  et  al .",
    "@xcite , lichtenstadt et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "modifications of flux - limited diffusion have been suggested ( janka  @xcite , @xcite ; dgani & janka  @xcite , cernohorsky & bludman  @xcite ) by which considerable improvement can be achieved for spherically symmetric , static and time - independent backgrounds ( smit  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , but satisfactory performance for the general time - dependent and non - stationary case has not been demonstrated yet .",
    "therefore the interest turns towards direct solutions of the boltzmann equation for neutrino transport , also because the need to check the applicability of any approximation with more elaborate methods remains .",
    "moreover , the rapid increase of the computer power and the wish to become independent of ad hoc constraints on generality or accuracy yield a motivation for the efforts of several groups ( in particular mezzacappa & bruenn  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and messer  et  al .",
    "@xcite ; more recently also burrows  @xcite ) to employ such boltzmann solvers in neutrino - hydrodynamics calculations of supernova explosions .",
    "there are different possibilities to solve the boltzmann equation numerically , one of which is by straightforward discretization of spatial , angular , energy , and time variables and conversion of the differential equation into a finite difference equation which can then be solved for the values of the neutrino phase space distribution function at the discrete mesh points .",
    "dependent on the number @xmath21 of angular mesh points , this procedure is called s@xmath22 method . since solving",
    "the equation is computationally very expensive , there are limitations to the resolution in angle and energy space .",
    "therefore tests need to be done whether a chosen ( and affordable ) number of energy and angle grid points is sufficient to describe the spectra well and , in particular , to reproduce the highly anisotropic neutrino distribution outside the neutrinosphere .",
    "another , completely different approach to solve the boltzmann equation is the monte carlo ( mc ) method by which the probabilistic history of a large number of sample neutrinos is followed to simulate the neutrino transport statistically ( tubbs  @xcite ; janka  @xcite , @xcite ; janka & hillebrandt  @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", the accuracy of the results is only limited by the statistical fluctuations associated with the finite number of sample particles .",
    "since the mc transport essentially does not require the use of angle and energy grids , it allows one to cope with highly anisotropic angular distributions and to treat with high accuracy neutrino reactions with an arbitrary degree of energy exchange between neutrinos and matter .",
    "however , the mc method is also computationally very time consuming , in particular if high accuracy on a fine spatial grid or at high optical depths is needed .",
    "therefore it is not the transport scheme of one s choice for coupling it with a hydrodynamics code .    in the present work ,",
    "we make use of the advantages of the mc method in order to test the accuracy and reliability of a newly developed neutrino transport code that follows the lines of the s@xmath0 scheme described by mezzacappa & bruenn  ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", we shall test the influence of the number of radial , energy , and angular mesh points on predicting the spectra and the radial evolution of the neutrino flux in `` realistic '' protoneutron star atmospheres as found in hydrodynamic simulations of supernova explosions ( wilson  @xcite ) . since our investigations",
    "are restricted to static and time - independent backgrounds , we concentrate on generic properties of the transport description which should also hold for more general situations .",
    "the radial evolution of the angular distribution of the neutrinos is such a property , because it is primarily dependent on the profile of the opacity and the geometry of the neutrino - decoupling region , but is not very sensitive to the details of the temperature and composition in the neutron star atmosphere .",
    "finally , good overall agreement of the mc and s@xmath0 results would strengthen the credibility of the mc transport with its limited ability to yield high spatial resolution .",

    "the dependence of the results from the s@xmath0 scheme on the energy , angular , and radial grid resolution is discussed , too .",
    "it is shown that an angular mesh that varies with the position in the star can improve the angular resolution and the representation of the beamed neutrino distributions without increasing the number of angular mesh points .",

    "the linearized equations adopt a block tridiagonal matrix form , which can be efficiently solved by the feautrier method .",
    "different from the finite difference method , the monte carlo method constructs the statistical ensemble average by following the destinies of individual test particles and performing the average when all particles have been transported . due to the fact that neutrinos are fermions",
    "it is impossible to propagate them independently .",
    "instead , the full time - dependent problem has to be simulated by following a large number ( typically @xmath46 ) of sample particles along their trajectories simultaneously in order to be able to construct the local phase space occupation functions and to include anisotropies as well as phase space blocking effects self - consistently into the calculation of the reaction rates and source terms .",
    "the modeling of the phase space distribution function from the local particle sample must guarantee the correct approach to chemical equilibrium .",
    "also the pauli exclusion principle has to be satisfied by the statistical average .",
    "we refer readers to janka  ( @xcite ) and references therein for details .",
    "the stellar background is divided into 15 equispaced spherical shells of homogeneous composition and uniform thermodynamical conditions , the number of which was determined both from physical requirements for spatial resolution and from the requirement to have acceptably small statistical errors in the local neutrino phase space distributions constructed from the chosen number of sample particles . although the monte carlo method is essentially mesh free , about 60 energy bins and approximately 35 angular bins are used only for representing the phase space distribution functions and for calculating the reaction kernels .",
    "neutrinos are injected into the computational volume at the inner boundary in the way described in the next section , while particles passing inwardly through the inner boundary are simply forgotten .",
    "the outer boundary is treated as a free boundary , where particles escape unhindered and no neutrino is assumed to come in from outside .      in the presented calculations we are mainly interested in the neutrino transport in the region where the neutrinos decouple from the stellar background and the emitted spectra form .",
    "therefore we calculate the neutrino transport only in the vicinity of the `` neutrinosphere '' . for this reason we have to set an inner boundary condition as well as an outer boundary condition for each model . at the outer boundary",
    "we impose the condition that no neutrinos enter the computational volume from outside . in the boltzmann solver , this is realized by setting @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the radius of the outermost mesh center , and @xmath49 is the radius of the outer surface which is dislocated outward from the outermost mesh center by half a radial cell width .    on the other hand",
    ", we have to specify the distribution of the neutrinos coming into the computational volume at the inner boundary @xmath50 which is dislocated inward from the innermost mesh center @xmath51 by half a radial cell width . for this purpose",
    "we adopt fermi - dirac distribution functions , in which the temperature , chemical potential and a normalization factor are determined such that the neutrino number density at @xmath50 ( where the neutrinos are essentially isotropically distributed because the inner boundary is chosen to be located at high optical depth ) , the average energy @xmath52 and the width of the energy spectrum , measured by the parameter @xmath53 ( see janka & hillebrandt  1989@xcite ) , are reproduced as given by wilson s ( @xcite ) models .",

    "we found that the energy spectra can be well calculated with about 15 energy mesh points .",
    "the fact that a reduction of the number of spatial grid points from more than 100 to only 15 in the neutron star atmosphere did not change the quality of the transport results means that the boltzmann code can be reliably applied to realistic simulations which involve the whole supernova core .",
    "moreover , it was demonstrated that the details of the interpolation between centered differencing and upwind differencing in the spatial advection term can affect the accuracy of the transport results .",
    "the excellent overall agreement of the results obtained with the boltzmann code and the monte carlo method confirms the reliability of both of them .",
    "good performance of the s@xmath0 method for solving the boltzmann equation of neutrino transport has been found before by mezzacappa & bruenn  ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) and messer  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) even for realistic dynamic situations .",
    "we hope that the work described here also helps to reveal possible deficiencies and weaknesses and thus will serve for further improvements of the numerical treatment of neutrino transport in supernovae and protoneutron stars .",
    "encouraging discussions and helpful suggestions by e. mller are acknowledged .",
    "we are grateful to a. mezzacappa for critical comments on a first version of the paper and for updating us with the most recent improvements of his code .",

    "<S> we have coded a boltzmann solver based on a finite difference scheme ( s@xmath0 method ) aiming at calculations of neutrino transport in type ii supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> close comparison between the boltzmann solver and a monte carlo transport code has been made for realistic atmospheres of post bounce core models under the assumption of a static background . </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated in detail the dependence of the results on the numbers of radial , angular , and energy grid points and the way to discretize the spatial advection term which is used in the boltzmann solver . </S>",
    "<S> a general relativistic calculation has been done for one of the models . </S>",
    "<S> we find overall good agreement between the two methods . </S>",
    "<S> this gives credibility to both methods which are based on completely different formulations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the number and energy fluxes and the mean energies of the neutrinos show remarkably good agreement , because these quantities are determined in a region where the angular distribution of the neutrinos is nearly isotropic and they are essentially frozen in later on . on the other hand , because of a relatively small number of angular grid points ( which is inevitable due to limitations of the computation time ) the boltzmann solver tends to underestimate the flux factor and the eddington factor outside the ( mean ) `` neutrinosphere '' where the angular distribution of the neutrinos becomes highly anisotropic . as a result , the neutrino number density is overestimated in this region . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that one has to be cautious in applying the boltzmann solver to a calculation of the neutrino heating in the hot - bubble region because it might tend to overestimate the local energy deposition rate . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison shows that this trend is opposite to the results obtained with a multi - group flux - limited diffusion approximation of neutrino transport , employing three different flux limiters , all of which lead to an underestimation of the hot - bubble heating . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the boltzmann solver can be considerably improved by using a variable angular mesh to increase the angular resolution in the semi - transparent regime .    </S>",
