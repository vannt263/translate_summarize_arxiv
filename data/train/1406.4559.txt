    "single - walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt ) is a member from the carbon based nano - material family , which is characteristic for superior thermal conductivity.@xcite in many practical applications , the quasi - one - dimensional swcnt is ensembled in a bulk form , such as the swcnt mat ( or buckypaper).@xcite tubes in the swcnt mat are randomly orientated , leading to the lose of swcnt s advanced properties . for instance , the room temperature thermal conductivity in the swcnt mat is typically in the range of @xmath0 to 10 wm@xmath1k@xmath1 , which is several orders lower than the swcnt.@xcite    besides the randomly orientated swcnt mat , there is a particular mat structure , with all tubes aligning parallel with each other .",
    "this structure is termed as swcnt forest , or swcnt crystalline .",
    "the vertically aligned swcnt forest has promising practical applications such as supercapacitor electrodes for compact energy - storage devices , since it retains most mechanical , thermal , and electronic properties of the swcnt.@xcite during the development of the swcnt forest , the density used to be a bottleneck for its practical applications , because most advanced properties of the swcnt forest will disappear if its density is too low.@xcite great progress has been achieved in recent years toward the production of dense swcnt forest .",

    "fabricated a high - density swcnt forest by using the zipping effect of liquids to draw tubes together.@xcite the density of the swcnt forest is increased to @xmath2  @xmath3 by zhong et al .",
    "using the point - arc microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition.@xcite in 2010 , a general catalytic chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) design is developed to synthesize aligned forests of carbon nanotube with an area density above @xmath4  @xmath3 , which can be further increased by using narrower tubes.@xcite this value is already very close to the theoretical maximum density in a compact array .    during the application of dense swcnt forests in the electronic device such as the supercapacitor electrodes , the thermal management becomes a key factor for its breakdown due to high power density . in this point of view , it is important to investigate the thermal transport capability of the swcnt forest.@xcite the swcnt forest inherits the good thermal transport properties in its axial direction from the swcnt . its thermal conductivity is around 1750 - 5800 wm@xmath1k@xmath1 in the axial direction as estimated in the experiment.@xcite the 3-omega measurements obtained the axial thermal conductivity of the swcnt forest to be 83 wm@xmath1k@xmath1 at 323  k , which should be higher with sample quality improvement.@xcite zhang et al",
    ". demonstrated that the room temperature axial thermal conductivity in swcnt forest is about 450  wm@xmath1k@xmath1 , and this value can be increased linearly by increasing forest density.@xcite besides the axial thermal transport , the inter - tube thermal conductivity is also very helpful to pump thermal energy out off the electronic device .",
    "although the swcnt forest is able to deliver heat along its axial direction very fast , the inter - tube thermal conductivity in the swcnt forest is extremely low due to the weak van der waals inter - tube interaction .    [",

    "the color is with respective to the temperature of each carbon atom.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    to improve the situation , significant effort has been made to increase the inter - tube thermal conductivity.@xcite it was found that the thermal conductivity of the nanotube forest can be enhanced considerably by increasing its density.@xcite basically , the low inter - tube thermal conductivity is mainly because the van der waals interaction between two swcnts is too weak . to enhance the inter - tube interaction , the ion irradiation technique was applied to introduce displacements between neighboring tubes , so the inter - tube thermal conductivity can be increased.@xcite another straightforward solution to enhance the inter - tube van der waals interaction is to compress the swcnt forest using mechanical engineering approach .",
    "this forms the main scope of present work .    in this paper , we perform molecular dynamics simulations to examine the compression effect on the inter - tube thermal conductivity of the swcnt forest .",
    "we find that the thermal conductivity increases linearly with increasing compression before the swcnt forest is buckled , because the inter - tube interaction is enhanced by compression .",
    "however , the thermal conductivity decreases quickly with further compression after the buckling of the swcnt forest , where the cross section of the swcnt changes from circular into ellipse .",
    "it is because the twisting ( tw ) mode is depressed in the buckled swcnt forest , while the radial breath mode ( rbm ) becomes a favorable vibration mode .",
    "the rbm has a poor heat delivery capability , leading to the decrease of the thermal conductivity with increasing compression in the buckled swcnt forest .",

    "we study the the inter - tube thermal conductivity , which captures the ability of transporting heat energy from a swcnt to its neighboring tubes in the forest .",
    "our study focuses on the swcnt forest that is constructed with armchair swcnt ( 8 , 8) .",
    "all swcnts are closely packed and parallel to each other in the axial direction ( see the bottom configuration in fig .  [ fig_dtdx ] ) .",
    "there are 26 swcnts aligned in the longitudinal direction and 4 swcnts in the lateral direction .",
    "the length of an individual swcnt is 14.8   , which forms the thickness of the swcnt forest .",
    "the thermal transport is simulated by the direct molecular dynamics simulation method implemented in the lammps package , while the ovito package was used for visualization in this section.@xcite the c - c interactions in the swcnt forest are described by the adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order ( airebo ) potential.@xcite the distance cut - off for the lennard - jones potential in the airebo is chosen as 1.02  nm .",
    "the standard newton equations of motion are integrated in time using the velocity verlet algorithm with a time step of 1  fs .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions .",
    "the thermal current across the system is driven by frequently moving kinetic energy from the cold region to the hot region.@xcite this energy transfer is accomplished via scaling the velocity of atoms in the hot or cold temperature - controlled regions .",
    "the total thermal current pumped into the hot region ( or pumped out from the cold region ) is @xmath11 .",
    "we have introduced a current parameter @xmath12 to measure the energy amount to be aggregated per unit time .",
    "we note that the total current @xmath13 is the _ eflux _ parameter in the _ fix heat _ command in lammps .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath12 is the ratio between the aggregated energy and the kinetic energy of each atom , i.e @xmath12 measures the thermal current for each atom with respect to its kinetic energy.@xcite we have chosen a small parameter @xmath14 .",
    "a small @xmath12 is very important for a successful simulation of inter - tube thermal transport , because the inter - tube thermal conductivity is so weak that atoms in cold regions will be frozen if their kinetic energies are pumped out too fast .",
    "the velocity scaling operation is performed every @xmath15 ps , which can be regarded as the relaxation time of this particular heat bath .",
    "we choose @xmath5  ps in all simulations .",
    "after thermalization for a sufficiently long time , a temperature profile is established .",
    "[ fig_dtdx ] shows the temperature profile for the swcnt forest at room temperature .",
    "the two insets show that the left middle region with relative axial position in @xmath16 $ ] and the right middle region within @xmath17 $ ] are linearly fitted to extract two temperature gradients . these two temperature gradients are averaged to give the final temperature gradient @xmath18 .",
    "the thermal conductivity is obtained through the fourier law , @xmath19 where a factor of @xmath20 comes from the fact that heat current flows in two opposite directions .",
    "the difference between the left and right temperature gradients is used to estimate the numerical error in the thermal conductivity .",
    "fig .  [ fig_stress_strain ] shows the stress - strain relation for the swcnt forest during mechanical compression at room temperature .",
    "the structure is compressed by uniformly deforming the structure in longitudinal direction with a strain rate of @xmath21  s@xmath1 , which is a typical value in md simulations as shown in previous works .",
    "@xcite the structure is allowed to fully relax in transverse directions .",
    "insets illustrate representative local configurations of the swcnt forest , which is compressed at strains of @xmath10 -0.05 , -0.07 , and -0.08 , respectively .",
    "the buckling of swcnts in the forest starts at @xmath22 . after buckling",
    ", the cross section of the swcnt turns into ellipse and the stress concentration becomes obvious at the two narrow corners of the ellipse , which is indicated by more bright color .",
    "phonon modes are the solely thermal energy carrier in the lattice thermal transport simulated in present work , so it is necessary to illustrate some associated phonon modes .",
    "[ fig_u ] shows the eigen vector of five typical phonon modes in the swcnt ( 8 , 8) .",
    "the blue arrow on top of each atom represents the vibrational displacement of each carbon atom in the corresponding phonon mode .",
    "the first four panels represent the four acoustic modes , i.e , the y - direction transverse acoustic ( tay ) , the z - direction transverse acoustic ( taz ) , the longitudinal acoustic ( la ) , and the tw mode .",
    "the last panel shows the rbm .    to examine the compression effect on the thermal conductivity of the swcnt forest , we present the compression dependence of the thermal conductivity in fig .  [ fig_thermal_conductivity ] .",
    "the swcnt forest is compressed to a given strain value prior to the heat transport simulation .",
    "the thermal conductivity is then simulated with the non - equilibrium molecular dynamics method as outlined in previous section .",
    "we pay special attention to the modulation of the thermal conductivity by the buckling phenomenon at @xmath22 .",
    "it shows that the mechanical compression can enhance the thermal conductivity linearly before the occurrence of buckling phenomenon at @xmath22 , which is different from the robust thermal conductivity in the graphene under compression.@xcite    left top inset illustrates an instant local configuration of the swcnt forest at compression with @xmath23 before buckling .",
    "the red arrow on top of each atom represents the velocity of the atom . after comparing this configuration with the eigen vector of the tw mode in fig .",
    "[ fig_u ] , one finds that the vibrations of most swcnts are similar as the eigen vector of the tw phonon mode ; i.e , the tw mode plays an important role for heat transport in the forest .",
    "it also implies that the tw - like movement has lower energy threshold , as the interface between two circular swcnts is very smooth . as a result , the tw - like movement is easy to be excited .    [ 1.0 ]    [ 1.0 ] .",
    "red arrows attached on each atom denote the velocity of carbon atoms .",
    "the texts tw and ta imply that swcnts are involving in movements similar as the tw mode or the ta mode .",

    "right bottom inset illustrates an instant local configuration of the swcnt forest at compression with @xmath24 after buckling phenomenon . as compared with the local configuration before buckling , a distinct feature in the buckled structure",
    "is that most swcnts are involved in a motion that is similar as the eigen vector of the rbm shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_u ] .",
    "the tw - like movement has been strongly depressed , because swcnts with ellipse cross section are difficult to twist , as a result of the effectively rough interface between two neighboring ellipse swcnts .",
    "we have performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to study the thermal conductivity of the compressed swcnt forest .",
    "the mechanical compression can enhance the thermal conductivity before the buckling of the swcnt in the forest , but it weakens the thermal conductivity after the buckling happens . the origin for this thermal conductivity manipulation is discussed based on the interplay between the tw mode ( good heat carrier ) and the rbm ( poor heat carrier ) .",
