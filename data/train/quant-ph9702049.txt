    "a central result of shannon s classical theory of information @xcite is the _ noisy channel coding theorem_. this result provides an _ effective procedure _ for determining the _ capacity _ of a noisy channel - the maximum rate at which classical information can be reliably transmitted through the channel .",
    "there has been much recent work on quantum analogues of this result @xcite .",
    "this paper has two central purposes .",
    "the first purpose is to develop general techniques for proving upper bounds on the capacity of a noisy quantum channel , which are applied to several different classes of quantum noisy channel problems .",
    "second , we point out some essentially new features that quantum mechanics introduces into the noisy channel problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : channels ] we give a basic introduction to the problem of the noisy quantum channel , and explain the key concepts .",
    "section [ sect : qops ] reviews the _",
    "quantum operations _ formalism that is used throughout the paper to describe a noisy quantum channel , and section [ sect : entropy exchange ] reviews the concept of the _ entropy exchange _ associated with a quantum operation .",
    "section [ sect : classical ] shows how the classical noisy channel coding theorem can be put into the quantum language , and explains why the capacities that arise in this context are not useful for applications such as quantum computing and teleportation .",
    "section [ sect : entanglement fidelity ] discusses the _ entanglement fidelity _ , which is the measure we use to quantify how well a state and its entanglement are transmitted through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "section [ sect : coherent information ] discusses the _ coherent information _ introduced in @xcite as an analogue to the concept of _ mutual information _ in classical information theory .",
    "many new results about the coherent information are proved , and we show that quantum entanglement allows the coherent information to have properties which have no classical analogue .",
    "these properties are critical to understanding what is essentially quantum about the quantum noisy channel coding problem .",
    "section [ sect : noisy coding revisited ] brings us back to noisy channel coding , and formally sets up the class of noisy channel coding problems we consider .",
    "section [ sect : upper bounds ] proves a variety of upper bounds on the capacity of a noisy quantum channel , depending on what class of coding schemes one is willing to allow .",
    "this is followed in section [ sect : discussion ] by a discussion of the achievability of these upper bounds and of earlier work on channel capacity .",
    "section [ sect : observed channel ] formulates the new problem of a noisy quantum channel with measurement , allowing classical information about the environment to be obtained by measurement , and then used during the decoding process .",
    "upper bounds on the corresponding channel capacity are proved .",
    "finally , section [ sect : conc ] concludes with a summary of our results , a discussion of the new features which quantum mechanics adds to the problem of the noisy channel , and suggestions for further research .",
    "the problem of noisy channel coding will be outlined in this section .",
    "precise definitions of the concepts used will be given in later sections .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in figure [ fig : channel0 ] .",
    "3.4 in    the noisy quantum channel , together with encodings and decodings .",
    "there is a _ quantum source _ emitting unknown quantum states , which we wish to transmit through the channel to some receiver .",
    "unfortunately , the channel is usually subject to noise , which prevents it from transmitting states with high fidelity . for example",
    ", an optical fiber suffers losses during transmission .",
    "another important example of a noisy quantum channel is the memory of a quantum computer .",
    "there the idea is to transmit quantum states _ in time_. the effect of transmitting a state from time @xmath0 to @xmath1 can be described as a noisy quantum channel .",
    "quantum teleportation @xcite can also be described as a noisy quantum channel whenever there are imperfections in the teleportation process @xcite .",
    "the idea of noisy channel coding is to encode the quantum state emitted by the source , @xmath2 , which one wishes to transmit , using some _ encoding operation _ , which we denote @xmath3 .",
    "the encoded state is then sent through the channel , whose operation we denote by @xmath4 .",
    "the output state of the channel is then _ decoded _ using some _ decoding operation _ , @xmath5 .",
    "the objective is for the decoded state to match with high fidelity the state emitted by the source . as in the classical theory",
    ", we consider the fidelity of large blocks of material produced by repeated emission from the source , and allow the encoding and decoding to operate on these blocks .",
    "a channel is said to transmit a source reliably if a sequence of block - coding and block - decoding procedures can be found that approaches perfect fidelity in the limit of large block size .    what then is the _ capacity _ of such a channel - the highest rate at which information can be reliably transmitted through the channel ?",
    "the goal of a _ channel capacity theorem _ is to provide a procedure to answer this question .",
    "this procedure must be an _ effective procedure _ , that is , an explicit algorithm to evaluate the channel capacity .",
    "such a theorem comes in two parts .",
    "one part proves an upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted through the channel .",
    "the other part demonstrates that there are coding and decoding schemes which attain this bound , which is therefore the channel capacity .",
    "we do not prove such a channel capacity theorem in this paper .",
    "we do , however , derive bounds on the rate at which information can be sent through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "what is a quantum noisy channel , and how can it be described mathematically ? this section reviews the formalism of quantum operations , which is used to describe noisy channels .",
    "previous papers on the noisy channel problem @xcite have used apparently different formalisms to describe the noisy channel .",
    "in fact , all the formalisms can be shown to be equivalent , as we shall see in this section .",
    "historically , quantum operations have also sometimes been known as _ completely positive maps _ or _",
    "superscattering operators_. the motivation in all cases has been to describe general state changes in quantum mechanics .",
    "a simple example of a state change in quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution experienced by a closed quantum system .",
    "the final state of the system is related to the initial state by a unitary transformation @xmath6 , @xmath7 although all closed quantum systems are described by unitary evolutions , in accordance with schrdinger s equation , more general state changes are possible for open quantum systems , such as noisy quantum channels .",
    "how does one describe a general state change in quantum mechanics ?",
    "the answer to this question is provided by the quantum operations formalism .",
    "this formalism is described in detail by kraus @xcite ( see also hellwig and kraus @xcite ) and is given short but detailed reviews in choi @xcite and in the appendix to @xcite . in this formalism",
    "there is an _ input state _ and an _ output state _ , which are connected by a map @xmath8",
    "this map is a _ quantum operation _ , @xmath9 , a linear , trace - decreasing map that preserves positivity .",
    "the trace in the denominator is included in order to preserve the trace condition , @xmath10 .    the most general form for @xmath9 that is physically reasonable ( in addition to being linear and trace - decreasing and preserving positivity",
    ", a physically reasonable @xmath9 must satisfy an additional property called complete positivity ) , can be shown to be @xcite @xmath11 the system operators @xmath12 , which must satisfy @xmath13 , completely specify the quantum operation . in the particular case of a unitary transformation , there is only one term in the sum , @xmath14 , leaving us with the transformation  ( [ eqtn : unitary operation ] ) .",
    "a class of operations that is of particular interest are the _ trace - preserving _ or _ non - selective _ operations .",
    "physically , these arise in situations where the system is coupled to some environment which is not under observation ; the effect of the evolution is averaged over all possible outcomes of the interaction with the environment .",
    "trace - preserving operations are defined by the requirement that @xmath15 this is equivalent to requiring that for all density operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 explaining the nomenclature `` trace - preserving '' . notice that this means the evolution equation ( [ eqtn : general evolution ] ) reduces to the simpler form @xmath18 when @xmath9 is trace - preserving .    the following _ representation theorem _ is proved in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it shows the connection between trace - preserving quantum operations and systems interacting unitarily with an environment , and thus provides part of the justification for the physical interpretation of trace - preserving quantum operations described above .",
    "_ theorem _ ( representation theorem for trace - preserving quantum operations ) :    suppose @xmath9 is a trace - preserving quantum operation on a system with a @xmath19-dimensional state space",
    ". then it is possible to construct an `` environment '' @xmath20 of at most @xmath21 dimensions , such that the system plus environment are initially uncorrelated , the environment is initially in a pure state @xmath22 and there exists a unitary evolution @xmath6 on system and environment such that @xmath23 here and elsewhere in the paper a subscript on a trace indicates a partial trace over the corresponding system ( @xmath20 in this case ) .",
    "conversely , given any initially uncorrelated environment @xmath24 ( possibly of more than @xmath21 dimensions , and initially impure ) , a unitary interaction @xmath6 between the system and the environment gives rise to a trace - preserving quantum operation , @xmath23    this theorem tells us that any trace - preserving quantum operation can always be _ mocked up _ as a unitary evolution by adding an environment with which the system can interact unitarily .",
    "conversely , it tells us that any such unitary interaction with an initially uncorrelated environment gives rise to a trace - preserving quantum operation .",
    "both these facts are useful in what follows .",
    "the picture we have of a quantum operation is neatly summarized by the following diagram .    ( 8,5)(0,0 ) ( 2,3)(1,1)@xmath25 ( 3,3.5)(1,0)3 ( 6,3)(1,1)@xmath26 ( 1.25,3.5)(0,0)@xmath27 ( 4,0.5)(1,1)@xmath20 ( 4.4,1.7)(0,1)1.6 ( 4.6,3.3)(0,-1)1.6 ( 4.8,2.5)(0,0)[cl]@xmath28    here , @xmath25 denotes the state of the system before the interaction with the environment , and @xmath26 the state of the system after the interaction . unless stated otherwise we follow the convention that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath19-dimensional . the environment system @xmath20 and the operator @xmath28 might be chosen to be the actual physical environment and its interaction with @xmath25 , but this is not necessary .",
    "the only thing that matters for the description of noisy channels is the dynamics of @xmath25 . for any given quantum operation @xmath9",
    "there are many possible representations of @xmath9 in terms of environments @xmath20 and interactions @xmath28 .",
    "we always assume that the initial state of @xmath20 is a _ pure state _ , and regard @xmath20 as a mathematical artifice .",
    "of course , the actual physical environment , @xmath29 , may be initially impure , but the above representation theorem shows that for the purposes of describing the dynamics of @xmath25 , it can be replaced by an `` environment '' , @xmath20 , which is initially pure and gives rise to exactly the same dynamics . in what follows",
    "it is this latter @xmath20 that is most useful .",
    "shannon s classical noisy coding theorem is proved for _ discrete memoryless channels_. discrete means that the channel only has a finite number of input and output states . by analogy",
    "we define a discrete quantum channel to be one which has a finite number of hilbert space dimensions . in the classical case",
    ", memoryless means that the output of the channel is independent of the past , conditioned on knowing the state of the source .",
    "quantum mechanically we take this to mean that the output of the channel is completely determined by the encoded state of the source , and is not affected by the previous history of the source .",
    "phrased in the language of quantum operations , we assume that there is a quantum operation , @xmath4 , describing the dynamics of the channel . the input @xmath30 of the channel is related to the output @xmath31 by the equation @xmath32 for the majority of this paper we assume , as in the previous equation , that the operation describing the action of the channel is trace - preserving .",
    "this corresponds to the physical assumption that no classical information about the state of the system or its environment is obtained by an external classical observer .",
    "all previous work on noisy channel coding with the exception of @xcite has assumed that this is the case , and we do so for the majority of the paper . in section [",
    "sect : observed channel ] we consider the case of a noisy channel which is being observed by some classical observer .",
    "in addition to the environment , @xmath20 , it is also extremely useful to introduce a _ reference system _ ,",
    "@xmath33 , in the following way .",
    "one might imagine that the system @xmath25 is initially part of a larger system , @xmath34 , and that the total is in a pure state , @xmath35 , satisfying @xmath36 such a state @xmath35 is called a _ purification _ of @xmath37 , and it can be shown @xcite that such a system @xmath33 and purifications @xmath35 always exist . from our point of view @xmath33",
    "is introduced simply as a mathematical device to purify the initial state .",
    "the joint system @xmath34 evolves according to the dynamics @xmath38 given by @xmath39    the overall picture we have of a trace - preserving quantum operation thus looks like :    ( 8,7)(0,0 ) ( 2,3)(1,1)@xmath25 ( 3,3.5)(1,0)3 ( 6,3)(1,1)@xmath26 ( 2,5)(1,1)@xmath33 ( 2.4,4.10)(0,1).05 ( 2.6,4.10)(0,1).05 ( 2.4,4.25)(0,1).05 ( 2.6,4.25)(0,1).05 ( 2.4,4.40)(0,1).05 ( 2.6,4.40)(0,1).05 ( 2.4,4.55)(0,1).05 ( 2.6,4.55)(0,1).05 ( 2.4,4.70)(0,1).05 ( 2.6,4.70)(0,1).05 ( 2.4,4.85)(0,1).05 ( 2.6,4.85)(0,1).05 ( 1,4.5)(0,0)@xmath40 ( 4,0.5)(1,1)@xmath20 ( 4.4,1.7)(0,1)1.6 ( 4.6,3.3)(0,-1)1.6 ( 4.8,2.5)(0,0)[cl]@xmath28    the picture we have described thus far applies only to _ trace - preserving _ quantum operations . later in the paper",
    "we will also be interested in quantum operations which are not trace - preserving .",
    "that is , they do not satisfy the relation @xmath41 , and thus @xmath42 in general .",
    "such quantum operations arise in the theory of _",

    "non trace - preserving operations arise when classical information about the state of the system is made available by such a measurement . for most of this paper",
    "the noisy quantum channel is described by a trace - preserving quantum operation .",

    "these _ conditional probabilities _",
    "@xmath82 completely describe the classical noisy channel .",

    "the mutual information between @xmath84 and @xmath85 is defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the shannon information of the random variable , @xmath84 , defined by @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "shannon showed that the capacity of a noisy classical channel is given by the expression @xmath90 where the maximum is taken over all possible distributions @xmath91 for the channel input , @xmath84 .",
    "notice that although this is not an explicit expression for the channel capacity in terms of the conditional probabilities @xmath92 , the maximization can easily be performed using well known techniques from numerical mathematics .",
    "that is , shannon s result provides an effective procedure for computing the capacity of a noisy classical channel .",
    "all these results may be re - expressed in terms of quantum mechanics .",
    "we suppose the channel has some preferred orthonormal basis , @xmath93 , of signal states . for convenience",
    "we assume the set of input states , @xmath93 , is the same as the set of output states , @xmath94 , of the channel , although more general schemes are possible .",
    "for the purpose of illustration the present level of generality suffices .",
    "a classical input random variable , @xmath84 , corresponds to an input density operator for the quantum channel , @xmath95 the statistics of @xmath84 are recoverable by measuring @xmath96 in the @xmath93 basis . defining operators @xmath97 by @xmath98 we find that the channel operation defined by @xmath99 is a trace - preserving quantum operation , and that @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the density operator corresponding to the random variable @xmath85 that would have been obtained from @xmath84 given a classical channel with probabilities @xmath82 .",
    "this gives a quantum mechanical formalism for describing classical sources and channels .",

    "the problem we have been considering is that of transmitting a discrete set of orthogonal states ( the states @xmath93 ) through the channel . in many quantum applications",
    "one is not only interested in transmitting a discrete set of states , but also arbitrary superpositions of those states .",
    "that is , one wants to transmit entire _ subspaces _ of states . in this case",
    ", the capacity of interest is the maximum rate of transmission of subspace dimensions .",
    "this may occur in quantum computing , cryptography and teleportation .",
    "it is also interesting in these applications to transmit the _ entanglement _ of states .",
    "this can not be done by considering the transmission of a set of orthogonal pure states alone .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath109 is not correct as a measure of how many subspace dimensions may be reliably transmitted through a quantum channel .",
    "for example consider the classical noiseless channel , @xmath111 where @xmath93 is an orthonormal set of basis states for the channel .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath112 where @xmath19 is the number of channel dimensions .",
    "yet it is intuitively clear , and is later proved in a more rigorous fashion , that such a channel can not be used to transmit any non - trivial subspace of state space , nor can it be used to transmit any entanglement , and thus its capacity for transmitting these types of quantum resources is zero .",
    "in this section we review a quantity known as the _ entanglement fidelity _ @xcite .",
    "it is this quantity which we use to study the effectiveness of schemes for sending information through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "the entanglement fidelity is defined for a _ process _ , specified by a quantum operation @xmath9 acting on some initial state , @xmath16 .",
    "we denote it by @xmath113 .",
    "the concerns motivating the definition of the entanglement fidelity are twofold :    1 .",
    "@xmath113 measures how well the _ state _ , @xmath16 , is preserved by the operation @xmath9 .",
    "an entanglement fidelity close to one indicates that the process preserves the state well .",
    "@xmath113 measures how well the _ entanglement _ of @xmath16 with other systems is preserved by the operation @xmath9 .",
    "an entanglement fidelity close to one indicates the process preserves the entanglement well .",
    "conversely , an entanglement fidelity close to zero indicates that the state or its entanglement were not well preserved by the operation @xmath9 .",
    "formally , the entanglement fidelity is defined by @xmath114 that is , the entanglement fidelity is the overlap between the initial purification @xmath35 of the state _ before _",
    "it is sent through the channel with the state of the joint system @xmath34 _ after _ it has been sent through the channel .",
    "the entanglement fidelity depends only on @xmath16 and @xmath9 , not on the particular purification @xmath35 of @xmath16 that is used @xcite",
    ". if @xmath9 has operation elements @xmath115 then the entanglement fidelity has the expression @xcite @xmath116 this expression simplifies for trace - preserving quantum operations since the denominator is one .",
    "the entanglement fidelity has the following properties @xcite .",
    "1 .   @xmath117 .",
    "2 .   @xmath118 if and only if for all pure states @xmath119 lying in the support of @xmath16 , @xmath120 3 .",
    "the entanglement fidelity is a lower bound on the fidelity defined by jozsa @xcite in the following sense , @xmath121 4 .",
    "suppose @xmath122 is an ensemble realizing @xmath16 , @xmath123 then the entanglement fidelity is a lower bound on the average fidelity for the pure states @xmath124 , @xmath125 5 .",
    "again suppose @xmath122 is an ensemble realizing @xmath126 then if the pure state fidelity @xmath127 for all @xmath119 in the support of @xmath16 , @xmath128 ( knill and laflamme @xcite . )",
    "there are several reasons for using the entanglement fidelity as our measure of success in transmitting quantum states .",
    "if we succeed in sending a source @xmath2 with high entanglement fidelity , we can send _ any _ ensemble for @xmath2 with high average pure - state fidelity , by item 4 above .",
    "entanglement fidelity is thus a more severe requirement of quantum coherence than average pure - state fidelity .",
    "moreover , the ability to preserve entanglement is of great importance in applications of quantum coding to , say , quantum computation , where one would like to be able to apply error - correction in a modular fashion to small portions of a quantum computer despite the fact that they may , in the course of quantum computation , become entangled with other parts of the computer @xcite .",
    "( of course , the general problem of finding the capacity of a noisy quantum channel for a _ given _ ensemble with average pure - state fidelity as the reliability measure is also worth investigating . )    an appropriate measure of how well a _",
    "subspace _ of quantum states is transmitted is the _ subspace fidelity",
    "_ @xmath129 where the minimization is over all pure states @xmath119 in the subspace whose projector is @xmath130 item 5 above implies that if the subspace fidelity is close to one , the entanglement fidelity is also close to one .",
    "the converse is not in general true .",
    "that is , reliable transmission of subspaces is a more stringent requirement than transmission of entanglement . therefore using entanglement fidelity as our criterion for reliable transmission yields capacities at least as great as those obtained when subspace fidelity is used as the criterion .",
    "we conjecture that these two capacities are identical .    as an alternative measure of subspace fidelity",
    ", one might consider the average pure state fidelity @xmath131 where the integration is done using the unitarily invariant measure on the subspace of interest . by item 4 above , the capacity resulting from this measure of reliability is at least as great as that which results when entanglement fidelity is used as the measure of reliability .",

    "then it would follow easily from the definition that @xmath332 for all @xmath288 , and thus @xmath333 this expression is exactly analogous to the classical expression for channel capacity as a maximum over input distributions of the mutual information between channel input and output .",
    "if this were truly a bound on the quantum channel capacity then it would allow easy numerical evaluations of bounds on the channel capacity , as the maximization involved is easy to do numerically , and the coherent information is not difficult to evaluate .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to assume that the quantum mechanical coherent information is subadditive , as shown by example ( [ eqtn : example 2 ] ) , and thus in general it is possible that @xmath334 we will later discuss results of shor and smolin @xcite which demonstrate that the channel capacity can exceed @xmath335 .",
    "notice that to evaluate the bound @xmath316 involves taking the limit in ( [ eqtn : unitary bound ] ) . to numerically evaluate this limit directly is certainly not a trivial task , in general .",
    "the result we have presented , that ( [ eqtn : unitary bound ] ) is an upper bound on channel capacity , is an important theoretical result , that may aid in the development of effective numerical procedures for obtaining general bounds .",
    "but it does not yet constitute an effective procedure .",
    "we now consider the case where something more general than a unitary encoding is allowed . in principle",
    ", it is always possible to perform a non - unitary encoding , @xmath3 , by introducing an extra ancilla system , performing a joint unitary on the source plus ancilla , and then discarding the ancilla .",
    "we define @xmath336 where the maximization is over all inputs @xmath16 to the encoding operation , @xmath3 , which in turn maps to @xmath288 copies of the channel .",
    "the bound on the channel capacity proved in this section is defined by @xmath337 once again , to prove that this limit exists one applies the lemma proved in appendix [ appendix : limit lemma ] .    to prove that this quantity is a bound on the channel capacity , one applies almost exactly the same reasoning as in the preceding subsection .",
    "the result is :    _ theorem _ suppose we consider a source @xmath338 and a sequence of encodings @xmath339 for the source .",
    "suppose further that there exists a sequence of decodings , @xmath340 such that @xmath341 then @xmath321    again , this result places an upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "the proof is very similar to the earlier proof of a bound for unitary encodings .",
    "one simply applies ( [ eqtn : fidelity lemma ] ) with @xmath342 and @xmath343 to give : @xmath344 taking @xmath328s on both sides of the equation completes the proof .",
    "it is instructive to see why the proof fails when the maximization is done over channel input states alone , rather than over all source states and encoding schemes .",
    "the basic idea is that there may exist source states , @xmath2 , and encoding schemes @xmath3 , for which @xmath345 this possibility stems from the failure of the quantum pipelining inequality , ( [ eqtn : example 1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the existence of such a scheme would cause the line of proof suggested above to fail .",
    "classically the pipelining inequality holds , and therefore the complication of having to maximize over encodings does not arise .",
    "having proved that @xmath316 is an upper bound on the channel capacity , let us now investigate some of the properties of this bound .",
    "first we examine the range over which @xmath316 can vary .",
    "note that @xmath346 since if @xmath16 is pure then @xmath347 for any encoding @xmath3 , and for all @xmath16 and @xmath3 , @xmath348 , since the channel output has @xmath327 dimensions .",
    "it follows that @xmath349 this parallels the classical result , which states that the channel capacity varies between @xmath350 and @xmath351 , where @xmath352 is the number of channel symbols .",
    "the upper bound on the classical capacity is attained if and only if the classical channel is noiseless .    in the case when @xmath4 takes a constant value , @xmath353 for all channel inputs , @xmath16 , it is not difficult to verify that @xmath354 .",
    "this is consistent with the obvious fact that the capacity for quantum information of such a channel is zero .",
    "the `` completely decohering channel '' is defined by @xmath355 with @xmath356 a complete orthonormal set of one - dimensional projectors .",
    "this channel is classically noiseless , yet a straightforward application of ( [ eqtn : abstract subadditivity ] ) yields @xmath357 and therefore this channel has zero capacity for the transmission of entanglement .    more generally , if @xmath358 , where @xmath359 , then @xmath354 by the same argument , and thus the channel capacity for such a channel is zero .",
    "as a special case of this result , it follows that the capacity of _ any _ classical channel as defined in section [ sect : classical ] to transmit entanglement is zero .",
    "provided the input and output dimensions of the channel are the same , it is not difficult to show that @xmath360 if and only if @xmath4 is unitary .",
    "it is also of interest to consider what happens when channels @xmath361 and @xmath362 are composed , forming a concatenated channel , @xmath363 . from the data processing inequality",
    "it follows that @xmath364 it is clear by repeated application of the data - processing inequality that this result also holds if we compose more than two channels together , and even holds if we allow intermediate decoding and re - encoding stages .",
    "classical channel capacities also behave in this way : the capacity of a channel made by composing two ( or more ) channels together is no greater than the capacity of the first part of the channel alone .",
    "although ( [ eqtn : example 1 ] ) might seem to suggest otherwise , in fact @xmath365 for let us suppose that @xmath3 is the encoding which achieves @xmath366 so that the total operation is @xmath367 as our encoding for the channel @xmath362 , we may use @xmath368 and decode with @xmath369 hence achieving precisely the same total operation .    inequalities analogous to ( [ eqtn : albert einstein ] ) and ( [ eqtn : ahristopher fuchs ] ) may also be stated for the actual channel capacity . clearly these statements are true as well .",
    "so far we have considered two allowed classes of encodings : encodings where a general unitary operation can be performed on a block of quantum systems , and encodings where a general trace - preserving quantum operation can be performed on a block of quantum systems .",
    "if large - scale quantum computation ever becomes feasible it may be realistic to consider encoding protocols of this sort .",
    "however , for present - day applications of quantum communication such as quantum cryptography and teleportation , it is realistic to consider much more restricted classes of encodings . in this section",
    "we describe several such classes .",
    "we begin by considering the class involving local unitary operations only .",
    "we refer to this class as @xmath6-@xmath370 .",
    "it consists of the set of operations @xmath3 which can be written in the form @xmath371 where @xmath372 are local unitary operations on systems @xmath210 through @xmath288 .",
    "another possibility is the class @xmath370 of encodings involving local operations only , i.e. operations of the form : @xmath373 in other words , the overall operation has a tensor product form @xmath374 .",
    "a more realistic class is @xmath210-@xmath370  encoding by local operations with one way classical communication .",
    "the idea is that the encoder is allowed to do encoding by performing arbitrary quantum operations on individual members ( typically , a single qubit ) of the strings of quantum systems emitted by a source .",
    "this is not unrealistic with present day technology for manipulating single qubits .",
    "such operations could include arbitrary unitary rotations , and also generalized measurements .",
    "after the qubit is encoded , the results of any measurements done during the encoding may be used to assist in the encoding of later qubits .",
    "this is what we mean by one way communication - the results of the measurement can only be used to assist in the encoding of later qubits , not earlier qubits .",
    "another possible class is @xmath211-@xmath370 - encoding by local operations with two - way classical communication .",
    "this may arise in a situation where there are many identical channels operating side by side in space .",
    "once again it is assumed that the encoder can perform arbitrary local operations , only this time two - way classical communication is allowed when performing the encoding .    for any class of encodings",
    "@xmath375 arguments analogous to those used above for general and for unitary block coding , ensure that the expression @xmath376 where @xmath377 is an upper bound to the rate at which quantum information can be reliably transmitted using encodings in @xmath375 .",
    "thus , in addition to the bounds for general and unitary encodings , there are bounds @xmath378 and @xmath379 which provide upper bounds on the rate of quantum information transmission for these types of encodings .",
    "a priori it is not clear what the exact relationships are amongst these bounds , although various inequalities may easily be proved , @xmath380 furthermore , note that these bounds allow general decoding schemes .",
    "it is possible that much tighter bounds may result if we restrict the decoding schemes in the same way we have restricted the encoding schemes .",
    "an interesting and important question is whether there are closed - form characterizations of the sets of quantum operations corresponding to particular types of encoding schemes such as @xmath210-@xmath370 and @xmath211-@xmath370 .",
    "for example , in the cases of @xmath6-@xmath370 and @xmath370 there are explicit forms ( [ eqtn : local unitary encodings],[eqtn : local encodings ] ) for the classes of encodings allowed .",
    "for @xmath210-@xmath370 the operations take the form : @xmath381 a drawback to this expression is that it is not written in a closed form , making it difficult to perform optimizations over @xmath210-@xmath370 .",
    "it would be extremely valuable to obtain a closed form for the set of operations in @xmath210-@xmath370 .",
    "one possible approach to doing this is to limit the range of the indices in the previous expression .",
    "this is related to the number of rounds of classical communication which are involved in the operation .",
    "similar remarks to these also apply to the class @xmath211-@xmath370 . indeed , it is not yet clear to us if there is an expression analogous to ( [ eqtn : 1-l explicit])for @xmath211-@xmath370 encodings .",
    "one possibility is : @xmath382 however , although all @xmath211-@xmath370 operations involving a finite number of rounds of communication can certainly be put in this form , we do not presently see why all operations expressible in this form should be realizable with local operations and two - way classical communication .",
    "the classes we have described in this subsection are certainly not the only realistic classes of encodings .",
    "many more classes may be considered , and in specific applications this may well be of great interest .",
    "what we have done is illustrated a general technique for obtaining _",
    "bounds _ on the channel capacity for different classes of encodings .",
    "a major difference between classical information theory and quantum information theory is the greater interest in the quantum case in studying different classes of encodings .",
    "classically it is , in principle , possible to perform an arbitrary encoding and decoding operation using a look - up table .",
    "however , quantum mechanically this is far from being the case , so there is correspondingly more interest in studying the channel capacities that may result from considering different classes of encodings and decodings .",
    "what then can be said about the status of the quantum noisy channel coding theorem in the light of comments made in the preceding sections ?",
    "while we have established upper bounds , we have not proved achievability of these bounds .",
    "how might one prove that these bounds are achievable ?",
    "lloyd @xcite has also proposed an expression involving a maximum of the coherent information as the channel capacity , @xmath383 and outlines a technique involving random coding for achieving rates up to this quantity .",
    "the criterion for reliable transmission used by lloyd appears to be the subspace fidelity criterion of eqtn .",
    "( [ eqtn : subspace fidelity ] ) .",
    "as noted earlier , this criterion is at least as strong as the criterion based on entanglement fidelity which we have been using , that is , asymptotically good coding schemes with respect to subspace fidelity are also asymptotically good with respect to the entanglement fidelity .",
    "suppose one applies coding schemes to achieve rates up to ( [ eqtn : lloyd ] ) , but with the basic system used in blocking taken to be @xmath288 of the old systems .",
    "then it is clear that rates up to @xmath384 may be achieved using such coding schemes , where the maximization is done over density operators for @xmath288 copies of the source .",
    "it follows that rates up to @xmath385 may be achieved .",
    "this quantity is simply the bound ( [ eqtn : unitary bound ] ) which we found earlier for noisy channels with the class of encodings restricted to be unitary .",
    "as remarked in the last section , it is in general not possible to identify the quantity appearing in the previous equation with the quantity ( [ eqtn : lloyd ] ) , because the coherent information is not , in general , subadditive , cf .",
    "( [ eqtn : example 2 ] ) .",
    "the coding schemes considered by lloyd appear to be restricted to be projections followed by unitaries .",
    "we call such encodings _ restricted encodings _ , since they do not cover the full class of encodings possible . for the purposes of proving upper bounds",
    "it is not sufficient to consider a restricted class of encodings , since it is possible that other coding schemes may do better , and therefore that the capacity is somewhat larger than ( [ eqtn : unitary bound 2 ] ) .",
    "we suspect that this is not the case , but have been unable to provide a rigorous proof .",
    "a heuristic argument is provided in subsection [ subsect : heuristics ] .    in the light of these remarks",
    "it is interesting that the coding scheme of shor and smolin @xcite provides an example where rates of transmission exceeding ( [ eqtn : lloyd ] ) are obtained .",
    "nevertheless , the general bound ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) must still be obeyed by a coding scheme of their type .",
    "however , one can still make progress towards a proof that the expression , ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) , which bounds the channel capacity , is the correct capacity .",
    "if we accept that it is possible to attain rates up to ( [ eqtn : unitary bound 2 ] ) , then the following four - stage construction shows that ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) is a correct expression for the capacity ; i.e. that in addition to being an upper bound as shown in section [ sect : upper bounds ] , it is also achievable .    3.4 in    noisy quantum channel with an extra stage , a restricted _ pre - encoding _ , @xmath386 .    for a fixed block size , @xmath288 , one finds an encoding , @xmath339 , for which the maximum in @xmath387 is achieved .",
    "one then regards the composition @xmath388 as a single noisy quantum channel , and applies the achievability result on restricted encodings to the joint channel @xmath388 to achieve an even longer @xmath389 block coding scheme with high entanglement fidelity .",
    "this gives a joint coding scheme @xmath390 which for sufficiently large blocks @xmath43 and @xmath288 can come arbitrarily close to achieving the channel capacity ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) .",
    "an important open question is whether ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) is equal to ( [ eqtn : unitary bound ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the former expression is at least as large as the latter ; we give a heuristic argument for equality in the next subsection , but rigorous results are needed .",
    "thus , we think it likely that the expression ( [ eqtn : unitary bound ] ) will turn out to be the maximum achievable rate of reliable transmission through a quantum channel . but",
    "this is still not satisfactory as an expression for the capacity , because of the difficulty of evaluating the limit involved . at a minimum",
    ", we would like to know enough about the rate of convergence of @xmath391 to its limit to be able to accurately estimate the error in a numerical calculation of capacity , thus providing an effective procedure for calculating the capacity to any desired degree of accuracy .",
    "it would also be useful to know whether the coherent information is concave in the input density operator ; if this were so , it would greatly aid in establishing that one has reached a maximum , since in this case a local maximum is guaranteed to be a global maximum ( appendix [ appendix : convexity ] ) .      for the purposes of obtaining a capacity theorem for general encodings and decodings ,",
    "a restriction on the class of encodings is clearly unacceptable .",
    "for example , given a source density operator whose eigenvalues are not all equal , we may not even be able to send it reliably through a noiseless channel whose capacity is just greater than the source entropy rate without doing non - unitary compression as described in @xcite .",
    "this compression , which is essentially projection onto the _ typical subspace _ @xcite of the source , is not a unitary operation , and thus we expect that nonunitary operations will be essential to showing achievability of the noisy channel capacity .",
    "we conjecture that once the projection onto the typical source subspace is accomplished , nonunitary operations are of no further use in achieving reliable transmission through a noisy channel .",
    "although we have not yet rigorously shown this , we give a heuristic argument below .",
    "if the conjecture is true then it can be used to show that expressions ( [ eqtn : unitary bound ] ) and ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) are equal .",
    "our heuristic argument applies only to sources for which a _ typical subspace _",
    "@xcite exists .",
    "this includes all i.i.d .",
    "sources , for which the output is of the form @xmath392 .",
    "let @xmath375 be the projector onto the typical subspace after @xmath288 uses of the source , and @xmath393 the projector onto the orthogonal subspace .",
    "given any positive @xmath394 it is true that for sufficiently large @xmath288 , @xmath395 defining the restriction of the source to the typical subspace , @xmath396 and applying the continuity lemma for entanglement fidelity , ( [ eqtn : continuity lemma ] ) , we see that @xmath397 for any trace - preserving operation @xmath9 . by choosing @xmath288 sufficiently large @xmath394",
    "can be made arbitrarily small , and thus we see that for the entanglement fidelity for the source to be high asymptotically , it is necessary and sufficient that the entanglement fidelity be high asymptotically for the restriction of the source to the typical subspace .",
    "we now come to the heuristic argument . in order that the entanglement fidelity for the total channel be high ,",
    "it is asymptotically necessary and sufficient that the composite operation @xmath398 have high entanglement fidelity when the source is restricted to the typical subspace , @xmath399 . hence , if an encoding @xmath339 is nonunitary on @xmath400 it must be `` close to reversible '' on @xmath400 and @xmath401 must be close to reversing it . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that perfect reversibility of an operation on a subspace @xmath402 is equivalent to the statement that the operation , restricted to that subspace , may be represented by operators @xmath403 where @xmath404 and @xmath405 is the projector onto @xmath402 . that is",
    ", the operation randomly ( with probabilities @xmath142 ) chooses a unitary which moves the state into one of a mutually orthogonal set of subspaces .",
    "hence @xmath406 _ in its action on the source s typical subspace , _ is close to some perfectly reversible operation @xmath407 consisting of `` randomly picking a unitary into an orthogonal subspace . ''",
    "hence the entanglement fidelity of the total operation @xmath301 is close to that of @xmath408 in which the encoding @xmath339 is replaced with @xmath409 the linearity of the entanglement fidelity in the operation implies that for at least one of the unitaries @xmath410 in the random - unitaries representation of the perfectly reversible operation @xmath407 , the entanglement fidelity is at least as good if the unitary is substituted for @xmath411 .",
    "therefore , arbitrary encodings @xmath339 are close to unitary encodings of @xmath399 into a subspace of the channel s hilbert space .",
    "thus the only nonunitarity which it is necessary to consider is the restriction to the source s typical subspace .",
    "in this section we consider a generalized version of the quantum noisy channel coding problem .",
    "suppose that in addition to a noisy interaction with the environment there is also a classical observer who is able to perform a measurement .",
    "this measurement may be on the channel or the environment of the channel , or possibly on both .",
    "the result of the measurement is then sent to the decoder , who may use the result to assist in decoding .",
    "we assume that this transmission of classical information is done noiselessly , although it is also interesting to consider what happens when the classical transmission also involves noise .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the state received by the decoder is again related to the state @xmath16 used as input to the channel by a quantum operation @xmath412 , where @xmath43 is the measurement result recorded by the classical observer , @xmath413 the basic situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : channel4 ] .",
    "the idea is that by giving the decoder access to classical information about the environment responsible for noise in the channel it may be possible to improve the capacity of that channel , by allowing the decoder to choose different decodings @xmath414 depending on the measurement result @xmath43 .    3.4 in    noisy quantum channel with a classical observer .",
    "we now give a simple example which illustrates that this can be the case .",
    "suppose we have a two - level system in a state @xmath16 and an initially uncorrelated four - level environment initially in the maximally mixed state @xmath415 , so the total state of the joint system is @xmath416 we fix an orthonormal basis @xmath417 the output of the channel is thus @xmath418 the quantum operation @xmath4 can be given two particularly useful forms , @xmath419 it is not difficult to show from the second form that @xmath420 and thus the channel capacity for the channel @xmath4 is equal to zero .",
    "suppose now that an observer is introduced , who is allowed to perform a measurement on the environment .",
    "this measurement is a von neumann measurement in the @xmath238 basis , and yields a corresponding measurement result , @xmath421",
    ". then the quantum operations corresponding to these four measurement outcomes are @xmath422 each of these is unitary , up to a constant multiplying factor , so conditioned on knowing the measurement result @xmath43 , the corresponding channel capacity @xmath423 is perfect .",
    "that is , @xmath424 for all measurement outcomes @xmath43 .",
    "this is an example where the capacity of the observed channel is strictly greater than for the unobserved channel .",
    "this result is particularly clear in the context of teleportation .",
    "nielsen and caves @xcite showed that the problem of teleportation can be understood as the problem of a quantum noisy channel with an auxiliary classical channel . in the single qubit teleportation scheme of bennett _",
    "et al _ @xcite there are four quantum operations relating the state alice wishes to teleport to the state bob receives , corresponding to each of the four measurement results . in that scheme",
    "it happens that those four operations are the @xmath412 we have described above .",
    "furthermore in the absence of the classical channel , that is , when alice does not send the result of her measurement to bob , the channel is described by the single operation @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , in order that causality be preserved we expect that the channel capacity be zero . on the other hand , in order that teleportation be able to occur we expect that the channel capacity @xmath425 , as was shown above .",
    "teleportation understood in this way as a noisy channel with a classical side channel offers a particularly elegant way of seeing that the transmission of quantum information may sometimes be greatly improved by making use of classical information .",
    "the remainder of this section is organized into three subsections .",

    "if we define @xmath437 we may use ( [ eqtn : fidelity lemma for general operations ] ) to easily prove that @xmath438 is an upper bound on the rate of reliable transmission through an observed channel , in precisely the same way we earlier used ( [ eqtn : fidelity lemma ] ) to prove bounds for unobserved channels .",
    "we may derive the same bound in another fashion if we associate observed channels with tracepreserving unobserved channels in the following fashion suggested by examples in @xcite . to an observed channel @xmath439 we associate a single tracepreserving operation @xmath159 from @xmath295 to a larger hilbert space @xmath440 , where @xmath402 is a `` register '' hilbert space .",

    "suppose a quantum system passes through a channel , interacts with an environment , and then measurements are performed on the _ environment alone_. how is the capacity of this observed channel related to the capacity of the channel which results if _ no measurement _ had been performed on the environment ?",
    "physically , it is clear that the capacity when measurements are performed must be at least as great as when no measurements on the environment are performed , since the decoder can always ignore the result of the measurement . in this subsection",
    "we show that bounds we have derived on channel capacity have this same property : observation of the environment can never decrease the bounds we have obtained .",
    "suppose @xmath459 are the operations describing the different possible measurement outcomes .",
    "then the operation describing the same channel , but without any observation of the environment , is @xmath460    recall the expressions for the bound on the capacity of the unobserved channel , @xmath461 and the observed channel , @xmath462 but the generalized convexity theorem ( [ eqtn : abstract subadditivity ] ) for coherent information implies that @xmath463 and thus @xmath464    to see that this inequality may sometimes be strict , return to the example considered earlier in this section in the context of teleportation . in that case",
    "it is not difficult to verify that @xmath465    what these results show is that our bounds on the channel capacity are never made any worse by observing the environment , but sometimes they can be made considerably better .",
    "this is a property that we certainly expect the quantum channel capacity to have , and we take as an encouraging sign that the bounds we have proved in this paper are in fact achievable , that is , the true capacities .",
    "all the questions asked about the bounds on channel capacity for an unobserved channel can be asked again for the observed channel : questions about achievability of bounds , the differences in power achievable by different classes of encodings and decodings , and so on .",
    "we do not address these problems here , beyond noting that they are important problems which need to be addressed by future research .",
    "many new twists on the problem of the quantum noisy channel arise when an observer of the environment is allowed .",
    "for example , one might consider the situation where the classical channel connecting the observer to the decoder is noisy .",
    "what then are the resources required to transmit coherent quantum information ?    it may also be interesting to prove results relating the classical and quantum resources that are required to perform a certain task .",
    "for example , in teleportation it can be shown that one requires not only the quantum channel , but also two bits of classical information , in order to transmit quantum information with perfect reliability .",
    "in this paper we have shown that different information transmission problems may result in different channel capacities for the same noisy quantum channel .",
    "we have developed some general techniques for proving upper bounds on the amount of information that may be transmitted reliably through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "perhaps the most interesting thing about the quantum noisy channel problem is to discover what is new and essentially _ quantum _ about the problem .",
    "the following list summarizes what we believe are the essentially new features :    1 .",
    "the insight that there are many essentially different information transmission problems in quantum mechanics , all of them of interest depending on the application .",
    "these span a spectrum between two extremes : * the transmission of a discrete set of mutually orthogonal quantum states through the channel .",
    "such problems are problems of transmitting classical information through a noisy quantum channel . * the transmission of entire subspaces of quantum states through the channel , which necessarily keeps all other quantum resources , including entanglement , intact .",
    "this is likely to be of interest in applications such as quantum computation , cryptography and teleportation where superpositions of quantum states are crucial .",
    "such problems are problems of transmitting coherent quantum information through a noisy quantum channel . + both these cases and a variety of intermediate cases are important for specific applications . for each case",
    ", there is great interest in considering different classes of allowed encodings and decodings .",
    "for example , it may be that encoding and decoding can only be done using local operations and one - way classical communication .",
    "this may give rise to a different channel capacity than occurs if we allow non - local encoding and decoding .",
    "thus there are different noisy channel problems depending on what classes of encodings and decodings are allowed .",
    "the use of quantum entanglement to construct examples where the quantum analogue of the classical pipelining inequality @xmath466 for a markov process @xmath467 , fails to hold ( cf . eqtn .",
    "( [ eqtn : example 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the use of quantum entanglement to construct examples where the subadditivity property of mutual information , @xmath468 fails to hold ( cf . eqtn .",
    "( [ eqtn : example 2 ] ) ) .",
    "there are many more interesting open problems associated with the noisy channel problem than have been addressed here .",
    "the following is a sample of those problems which we believe to be particularly important :    1 .",
    "the development of an effective procedure for determining channel capacities .",
    "we believe that this is the most important problem remaining to be addressed . assuming our upper bound @xmath469 is , in fact , the channel capacity for general encodings , it still remains to find an effective procedure for evaluating this quantity .",
    "both maximizations can be done relatively easily , since they are of a continuous function over a compact set .",
    "however , we do not yet understand the convergence of the limit well enough to have an effective procedure for evaluating this quantity .",
    "once an effective procedure has been obtained for evaluating channel capacities , it still remains to develop _ good _ numerical algorithms for performing the evaluation .",
    "assuming that the evaluation involves some kind of maximization of the coherent information , it becomes important to know whether the coherent information is concave in @xmath126 combined with the convexity of the coherent information in the operation this would give a powerful tool for the development of numerical algorithms for the determination of channel capacity .",
    "3 .   estimation of channel capacities for realistic channels .",
    "this work could certainly be done theoretically and perhaps also experimentally .",
    "recent work on _ quantum process tomography _",
    "@xcite points the way toward experimental determination of the quantum channel capacity .",
    "a related problem is to analyze how stable the determination of channel capacities is with respect to experimental error .",
    "as suggested in subsection [ subsect : other encoding protocols ] it would be interesting to see what channel capacities are attainable for different classes of allowable encodings and / or decodings , for example , encodings where the encoder is only allowed to do local operations and one - way classical communication , or encodings where the encoder is allowed to do local operations and two - way classical communication . we have showed how to prove bounds on the channel capacity in these cases ; whether these bounds are attainable is unknown .",
    "5 .   the development of rigorous general techniques for proving attainability of channel capacities , which may be applied to different classes of allowed encodings and decodings .",
    "6 .   finding the capacity of a noisy quantum channel for classical information .",
    "a related problem arises in the context of _ superdense coding _",
    ", where one half of an epr pair can be used to send two bits of classical information . it would be interesting to know to what extent this performance is degraded if the pair of qubits shard between sender and receiver is not an epr pair , but rather the sharing is done using a noisy quantum channel , leading to a decrease in the number of classical bits that can be sent . given a noisy quantum channel , what is the maximum amount of classical information that can be sent in this way ?",
    "all work done thus far has been for discrete channels , that is , channels with finite dimensional state spaces .",
    "it is an important and non - trivial problem to extend these results to channels with infinite dimensional state spaces .",
    "8 .   a more thorough study of noisy channels which have a classical side channel .",
    "can the classical information obtained by an observer be related to changes in the channel capacity ?",
    "what if the classical side channel is noisy ?",
    "many other fascinating problems , too many to enumerate here , suggest themselves in this context .",
    "there are many other ways the classical results on noisy channels have been extended - considering channels with _ feedback _",
    ", developing _ rate - distortion _ theory , understanding _ networks _ consisting of more than one channel , and so on .",
    "each of these could give rise to highly interesting work on noisy quantum channels .",
    "it is also to be expected that interesting new questions will arise as experimental efforts in the field of quantum information develop further . perhaps of chief interest to us is to develop a still clearer understanding of the essential differences between the quantum noisy channel and the classical noisy channel problem .",

    "various convexity and concavity properties are useful in calculating classical channel capacities , and the same is true in the quantum situation .",
    "this appendix is devoted to an explication of the basic properties of convexity and concavity related to the coherent information and the relation of these properties to expressions such as ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) .    a _ convex set _ ,",
    "@xmath492 , is a subset of a vector space such that given any two points @xmath493 and any @xmath204 such that @xmath494 , then the _ convex combination _ , @xmath495 , is also an element of @xmath492 .",
    "geometrically , this means that given any two points in the set , the line joining them is also in the set .",
    "an _ extremal point _ of @xmath492 is a point @xmath352 which can not be formed from the convex combination of any other two points in the set .",

    "this follows by supposing that @xmath498 and @xmath499 are distinct local maxima .",
    "if @xmath500 , say , then @xmath501 by concavity of @xmath496 . by choosing sufficiently small values of @xmath204",
    "we see that this violates the fact that @xmath498 is a local maximum .",
    "thus @xmath496 has the same value for all local maxima , from which it follows that all local maxima are also global maxima for the function .",
    "if the coherent information turns out to be concave in the input density operator , this property will be useful in evaluating capacity bounds such as ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) .",
    "the proof is obvious .",
    "the reason for our interest in the proof is because for fixed @xmath16 and trace - preserving operations @xmath9 , the coherent information @xmath223 is a convex , continuous function of the operation @xmath9 .",
    "the set of trace - preserving quantum operations forms a compact , convex set , and thus by the convexity lemma , @xmath223 attains its maximum for a quantum operation @xmath9 which is extremal in the set of all trace - preserving quantum operations .",
    "this result provides a considerable saving in the class of quantum operations that must be optimized over in order to numerically calculate expressions of the form ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this only takes us part of the way towards proving that the expressions ( [ eqtn : general bound ] ) and ( [ eqtn : unitary bound ] ) are identically equal , or , alternatively , it suggests a starting point for a search for counterexamples to the proposition that the two quantities are equal .",
    "if the extremal points of the set of quantum operations were the unitary operations we would be done .",
