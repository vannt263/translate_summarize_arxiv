    "social network analysis , henceforth abbreviated to sna , is an area of research which has seen an explosion of activity in recent years , with a flood of both academic research papers and more popular literature .",
    "the field is a paradigm of `` cross - disciplinary research '' , attracting the attention of people from a wide range of academic specialisations .",
    "the opposite ends of this spectrum of specialisations are essentially occupied by sociologists and mathematicians .",
    "sociologists often do the groundwork of collecting empirical data and compiling them into networks .",
    "this work is crucial - without it , no scientific analysis is possible and the field ceases to exist",
    ". quantitative analysis of social networks often involves the comparison of real networks with randomly generated ones , and the search for patterns in the actual networks which occur with a frequency far different from what one would expect if links were formed completely at random .",
    "such comparative analysis can be mathematically quite sophisticated , and in general requires the analyst to have a good working knowledge of that branch of discrete mathematics known as `` random graphs '' .",
    "i am a mathematican with a background in discrete mathematics , who has been recently taking part in a reading course on sna ( see the acknowledgement below ) out of simple curiosity about this exciting area .",
    "the participants in this course reflect , in the best possible manner , the interdisciplinary nature of the field , and several of the texts we have been using are written primarily for an audience of sociologists with limited mathematical training .",
    "one of these is a recently published text by charles kadushin @xcite , a major figure on the sociological side of sna .",
    "as it states on the back cover , the book is `` _ aiming for those interested in this fast - moving area who are not mathematically inclined _ '' .",
    "nevertheless , the book does employ some mathematical terminology and present some explicitly quantitative analyses .",
    "such effort can in general only be applauded , and a mathematician should approach such a text in a spirit of generosity .",
    "however , i quickly uncovered problems with this book of a very serious nature .",
    "fundamental concepts , both sociological and mathematical , are introduced in a way which simply does not make sense .",
    "the first quantitative analysis of an actual network , the celebrated karate club network of zachary @xcite , is deeply flawed .",
    "it s not my purpose here to do a comprehensive book review - all the problems i will discuss arise , after a general introductory chapter , in the first 17 pages of the substantive text .",
    "rather i want to correct the author s presentation of some fundamental concepts in a way which might prove useful to researchers and students in the future , especially to sociologists who might be interested in seeing how a mathematician approaches this material .",
    "i shall be primarily concerned with the mathematical notion of _ transitivity _ and its application to the sociological notion of the same name , along with the more restrictive notion of _",
    "balance_. i shall discuss these terms in a manner which is logically consistent , but also consistent with the way sociologists try to apply them . in doing so , i will explain what is wrong with kadushin s text , the crucial point being that the concept of balance can not be meaningfully discussed for graphs unless they are undirected .",
    "this material is presented in section 3 .    in section 4",
    "we perform a correct triad census for the karate club graph of zachary , which involves comparison of the actual counts of different triad configurations with those in an erds - renyi random graph of the same ( expected ) edge density . though the mathematics involved is `` standard ''",
    ", i will present it in detail .",
    "the presentation of this material in the book is deeply flawed , as the author compares the actual network with random _ directed _ graphs .",
    "he is led to the qualitatively false conclusion that zachary s graph is very balanced .",
    "the correct analysis leads to a quite different , and more interesting conclusion . in zachary s graph ,",
    "triads with one edge out of three present are significantly underrepresented , compared to corresponding random graphs , whereas all other triad configurations are overrepresented .",
    "the graph is therefore quite unbalanced .    in section 5 ,",
    "i show that the distribution of triads observed in zachary s graph is characteristic of a precisely defined class of `` starlike '' networks .",
    "this is the mathematically most demanding part of the article .",
    "a reader not primarily interested in rigorous proofs may therefore choose to just skim over section 5 and jump ahead to section 6 , where i discuss what i think are plausible sociological interpretations of such networks , and of unbalanced networks in general , and their relevance to understanding the social dynamics in zachary s karate club .    in section 7",
    ", i will revisit the concept of balance itself .",
    "on the one hand , i will show that , with a small change in the basic definitions , balance automatically incorporates dyadic symmetry , something which might help avoid the kind of confusion which arose in @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", i will discuss what seems to be the obvious notion of `` balance '' which makes sense for any weighted digraph .",
    "the quotation marks here are important , because the notion i propose is quite different from that which is used in sociology , so much so that a new term would need to be invented for it .",
    "section 8 is a short discussion of some inevitably controversial issues which this note raises .",
    "the following notation and terminology is standard , but it is important that we leave no room for doubt as to what statements in subsequent sections mean .",
    "non - mathematicians may also find this section useful . a _ directed graph ( digraph ) _ is a pair @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a finite set of so - called _ nodes _ , and @xmath2 is a set of ordered pairs @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are distinct elements of @xmath1 .",
    "the ordered pair @xmath3 is referred to as the _ directed edge from @xmath4 to @xmath5 _ , and written symbolically as @xmath6 . note that our definition allows for the existence of up to two directed edges between a given pair of nodes , one in each direction .",
    "we disallow _ loops _ , i.e. : edges from a node to itself , though one should keep in mind that , in many social networks , it is implicit in the meaning of the edges that a loop exists at each node .    given a digraph @xmath7 , and a subset @xmath8 , we can consider the digraph @xmath9 whose nodes are the elements of @xmath10 and whose edge - set @xmath11 consists of those directed edges @xmath6 in @xmath2 such that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 lie in @xmath10 . we refer to @xmath12 as the _ sub(di)graph _ of @xmath13 _ induced _ on the subset @xmath10 . of particular importance in this paper will be subgraphs induced on 2 or 3 nodes .",
    "a digraph on 2 nodes is called a _ dyad _ , while one on 3 nodes is called a _",
    "triad_.    a digraph is said to be _ symmetric _ if , for each pair @xmath14 of distinct nodes , the directed edges @xmath6 and @xmath15 are either both present or both absent",
    ". the description of such digraphs can be simplified by replacing each existing pair of directed edges by a single undirected edge .",
    "this yields what we shall simply call a _ graph _",
    ", i.e. : the word `` graph '' on its own means that the edges are undirected .",
    "we shall also use the terms `` dyad '' and `` triad '' for graphs on 2 and 3 nodes respectively , and it will always be clear from the context whether we are considering graphs or digraphs .    for graphs it is clear that there are only two possible dyads , since a single edge is either present or not . given three nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , there are @xmath18 possibilities for a graph on these three nodes , since each of 3 possible edges can be present or not .",
    "however , these 8 graphs fall into only four _ isomorphism classes _ or _ configurations _ , the latter being the term of choice for sociologists . in general , two graphs ( resp .",
    "digraphs ) are said to be _ isomorphic _ if they contain exactly the same edges ( resp . directed edges ) up to a relabelling of the nodes . for graph triads ,",
    "the isomorphism class is completely determined by the number of edges present nodes , when @xmath19 is large .",
    "see @xcite . ] , which can be 0,1,2 or 3 .",
    "so , for example , given nodes @xmath20 , the graph containing only the edge between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is isomorphic to that containing the single edge between @xmath22 and @xmath17 , since the latter graph can be got from the former by relabelling the nodes @xmath20 as @xmath23 respectively . of a total of 8 possible graphs ,",
    "there are 1,3,3 resp . 1 in the isomorphism classes with 0,1,2 resp .",
    "3 edges . finally , note that a graph on 3 nodes with all 3 edges present is usually called a _",
    "triangle _ , whereas one where no edges are present is said to be _",
    "empty_. if exactly 2 edges are present , the triad is called _ intransitive _ ( see section 3 below ) .    for digraphs , there are 3 isomorphism classes of dyads , depending on whether neither , exactly one of , or both the two possible directed edges are present .",
    "it is a more challenging exercise to verify that there are 16 isomorphism classes of digraph triads .",
    "this fact is well - known to sociologists , however , who have also adopted a conventional numbering of the 16 possibilities .",
    "the complete list of digraph triads can be found on page 24 of @xcite , along with the conventional numbering .",
    "it s important to keep in mind that , given three nodes @xmath20 , there are @xmath24 possibilites for a digraph on these three nodes , since each of 6 possible directed edges can be present or not . however , the 64 digraphs fall into just 16 isomorphism classes . with respect to the conventional numbering , it can be checked that the number of digraphs in each class is given by the sequence of 16 numbers @xmath25",
    "transitivity is a basic concept with a precise meaning in mathematics . in sna ,",
    "the notion is captured informally with the motto +   + m1 . ``",
    "the friend of my friend is my friend '' .",
    "+   + to make this motto precise , we may consider a digraph , where the nodes represent people , and where a directed edge from @xmath26 to @xmath27 means that @xmath26 considers @xmath27 as his / her friend .",
    "then a formal statement of m1 is the following : +   + m1 .",
    "let @xmath28 be three distinct nodes in a digraph .",
    "if the directed edges @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both present , then so is the directed edge @xmath31 .",
    "+   + this is very close to the formal definition of transitivity in mathematics , the only difference being that , in the latter , the nodes @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not assumed to be distinct . in sociology , the notion of transitivity leads naturally to that of _ balance_. the latter is captured informally by m1 along with three further , similar - sounding mottos : +   + m2 . ``",
    "the enemy of my enemy is my friend '' + m3 .",
    "`` the enemy of my friend is my enemy '' .",
    "`` the friend of my enemy is my enemy '' . +   + the corresponding formal statements are then as follows : +   + m2 .",
    "let @xmath28 be three distinct nodes in a digraph .",
    "if the directed edges @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both absent , then the directed edge @xmath31 is present . +   + m3 .",
    "let @xmath28 be three distinct nodes in a digraph .",
    "if the directed edge @xmath29 is present and the directed edge @xmath30 is absent , then the directed edge @xmath31 is absent .",
    "let @xmath28 be three distinct nodes in a digraph .",
    "if the directed edge @xmath29 is absent and the directed edge @xmath30 is present , then the directed edge @xmath31 is absent . +   + formally , balance is a property of digraph triads .",
    "a digraph triad is said to be _ ( completely ) balanced _ if m1-m4 all hold .",
    "it is a straightforward but tedious exercise to verify that a balanced triad must be symmetric , and the resulting graph must then contain either 1 or 3 edges . indeed , the table on the next page shows which of the properties m1-m4 hold for each of the 16 isomorphism classes of digraph triads ( y indicates that the property holds , n that it does nt ) .",
    "here is an example to assist the reader .",
    "[ fig : ini ]    consider triad type 7 , which is the graph on the left of figure 1 .",
    "call the three vertices @xmath20 , starting from the bottom left corner and reading counter - clockwise .",
    "hence this triad contains the three directed edges @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the ordered triple @xmath37 fails to satisfy m1 , since @xmath36 and @xmath35 are both present , but @xmath38 is absent .",
    "the triple @xmath39 fails to satisfy m4 , since @xmath40 is absent whereas @xmath36 and @xmath34 are both present .",
    "the triple @xmath41 also fails to satisfy m4 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath42 + for the sociologist , a potential use of mottos m1-m4 is to make predictions about unseen parts of a social network .",
    "for example , suppose we have three people @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and have only been able to observe directly the interactions between two pairs , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "then based on our observations and the mottos m1-m4 , we could try to make predictions about the unobserved relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "the fact that a balanced triad must be symmetric then assumes crucial importance , since it implies that , as a matter of pure logic , the mottos m1-m4 can not make unambiguous predictions about unobserved social relationships , unless the observed relationships are symmetric .    to drive this crucial point home",
    ", we consider an example .",
    "suppose we have a friendship network and three entities @xmath20 .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been observed to like one another , whereas @xmath22 likes @xmath17 , but @xmath17 dislikes @xmath22 ( see triad type 8 , to the right in figure 1 ) .",
    "hence , at least one pairwise relationship is not symmetric .",
    "however , we have full information about two pairs , so if the mottos m1-m4 are to be of any use in this situation , then it should be possible to make unambigous predictions about the relationships in the third pair .",
    "so we ask the question , should one expect @xmath21 to like @xmath17 or not ,",
    "i.e. : should the directed edge @xmath40 be present in the network ?",
    "well , on the one hand , @xmath21 likes @xmath22 and @xmath22 likes @xmath17 , so m1 suggests that , yes , @xmath21 should like @xmath17 . but suppose @xmath21 does in fact like @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath21 likes @xmath17 , but @xmath17 dislikes @xmath22 , so m3 suggests that @xmath21 should also dislike @xmath22 .",
    "but @xmath21 likes @xmath22 , a contradiction .",
    "+   + in sociology , the first mention of the idea of balance is generally attributed to heider .",
    "a direct citation from heider s work appears on page 23 of @xcite : +    `` _ in the case of three entities , a balanced state exists if all three relations are positive in all respects , or if two are negative and one is positive ( heider 1946 , 110 ) _ '' .",
    "+   + in heider s formulation it is clear that `` balance '' is to be considered as a property of the collection of pairwise relationships between three entities , in which each pairwise relationship is already mutual ( positive in all respects or negative in all respects ) .",
    "the meat of his definition clearly concerns the set of `` all three such ( pairwise mutual ) relations '' , not the pairwise relations themselves in isolation . hence , though heider did not use the language of ( di)graphs , it seems clear that he understood that balance could only be a useful notion if one assumed symmetry .",
    "+   + now let @xmath13 be a graph on at least 3 nodes .",
    "we say that @xmath13 is _",
    "( completely ) balanced _ if every triad in @xmath13 is balanced .",
    "it is easy to see that such a graph must either be a _",
    "( all possible edges are present ) or a disjoint union of two cliques can have at most two connected components , because any triad whose three vertices all came from distinct components would be empty and hence unbalanced .",
    "now let @xmath32 be two vertices in the same connected component .",
    "we need to show that the edge @xmath43 is present in @xmath13 .",
    "since these vertices lie in the same component , there must be _ some _ path between them , say @xmath44 first consider the triad consisting of @xmath45 .",
    "two of three edges are already present , namely @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since all triads are balanced , the edge @xmath48 must also be present .",
    "next consider the triad formed by @xmath49 . by the previous step",
    ", we already know that the two edges @xmath48 and @xmath50 are present .",
    "balance thus requires that @xmath51 also be present .",
    "we can keep iterating this argument and deduce that @xmath26 is joined by an edge to every vertex @xmath52 along the path above , and hence finally to @xmath27 . ] . as real - world ( symmetric ) social networks are rarely this simple , the notion of balance is not very useful in sna if taken literally .",
    "indeed , its basic weakness lies in the mottos m2-m4 which , in their informal expression , carry the assumption that the absence of a friendship implies its opposite , an emnity , whereas in reality it may simply imply something like indifference .",
    "hence , for example , a social network whose graph is a disjoint union of 3 or more cliques will not be balanced , since it will contain lots of empty triads , even if the members of different cliques merely have nothing in common and are not mutually antagonistic .",
    "notice , however , that such a graph will still have no intransitive triads , which supports the intuition that transitivity , as expressed by m1 , is a much more coherent and fundamental idea than balance , as expressed by m1-m4 .",
    "if a social network is observed to possess a large number of intransitive triads , then it indicates that something interesting is going on .",
    "this is the basic idea that will occupy us in the remaining sections of this paper .",
    "+   + a weaker , but potentially more useful , `` balance hypothesis '' would assert that , in a real - life , symmetric social network , balanced triads should appear with greater frequency than in a graph of the same edge density where the edges are placed at random .",
    "recall that , for a positive integer @xmath19 and a real number @xmath53 between zero and one , the erds - renyi random graph @xmath54 is the random graph on @xmath19 nodes in which each of the @xmath55 possible edges appears with probability @xmath53 , independently of all other edges .",
    "we can now state the +   + general balance hypothesis ( gbh ) : consider a social network in which all pairwise relationships are mutual , and hence the network can be represented as an undirected graph @xmath13 .",
    "suppose this graph has @xmath19 nodes and @xmath56 edges , thus edge density @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be either 1 or 3 .",
    "then the number of triads in @xmath13 in which exactly @xmath58 edges are present should exceed the expected number of such configurations in the erds - renyi random graph @xmath54 . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath58 is either 0 or 2 , then the number of triads in @xmath13 in which exactly @xmath58 edges are present should be less than the expected number of such configurations in @xmath54 .",
    "+   + if a network fails the balance hypothesis , in particular if intransitive triads are overrepresented compared to @xmath54 , then it is an indication that something interesting is going on . for each @xmath59 , let @xmath60 denote the expected number of @xmath58-edge triads in @xmath54 , and @xmath61 be the expected proportion of such triads . here",
    "@xmath62 is the total number of triads in a graph on @xmath19 nodes .",
    "we record the fact that @xmath63 = \\left[(1-p)^3 , 3p(1-p)^2 , 3p^2 ( 1-p ) , p^3\\right].\\ ] ] the usefulness of gbh as a reference point is indicated by the fact that it is satisfied by the graphs considered above , which are disjoint unions of cliques . to prove this in full generality is a rather uninspiring calculus exercise . for conceptual purposes , imagine the number @xmath64 of cliques as being fixed , suppose the cliques have equal size @xmath19 and",
    "let the latter number tend to infinity . for large @xmath19 , the edge density in the graph will be approximately @xmath65 . hence , by ( 3.1 )",
    ", the expected proportions of @xmath58-edge triads in the relevant erds - renyi graph will be approximately given by the vector @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "by constrast , in the graph itself , one may check that the corresponding proportions are approximately @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "hence , 1- and 3-edge triads are overrepresented , whereas 0- and 2-edge triads are underrepresented , in accordance with gbh .",
    "of course , it is the complete absence of intransitive triads which is the most striking feature .",
    "+   + it is logically possible to extend the gbh to digraphs , in which case the assertion would be that balanced triads should be overrepresented compared to a random digraph of the same edge density .",
    "however , such an extension of the hypothesis does not seem to add anything conceptually .",
    "for , as we showed earlier , a balanced triad in a digraph must be symmetric .",
    "if an experimenter , in constructing his network , decides to make it directed , then he probably has a good reason for expecting there to be a good deal of asymmetry .",
    "if it turns out that there is a bias towards symmetry , at the level of dyads , then this bias will extend to any larger , symmetric configurations .",
    "any additional bias towards balanced configurations should then be interpreted , in the first place , with respect to the gbh for undirected graphs . in other words ,",
    "a balance hypothesis for digraphs is in essence nothing more than the corresponding hypothesis for undirected graphs , together with a `` symmetry hypothesis '' , which would assert that symmetric dyads should be overrepresented , in comparison to randomly constructed digraphs .",
    "see section 6 for some further discussion of the relevance of the latter",
    ".    on the other hand , there may still be good reason to expect that transitivity , as expressed by m1 , will usually be satisfied in directed networks in general .",
    "property m1 seems reasonable in the absence of any assumptions about symmetry .",
    "hence , for digraphs , it still seems useful to formulate a _",
    "transitivity hypothesis_. note , though , that transitivity is a property , not of induced subgraphs ( triads ) but of ordered triples of nodes .",
    "we can now state the +   + general transitivity hypothesis ( gth ) : consider a social network in which pairwise relationships are not necessarily mutual , and hence the network can be represented as a directed graph @xmath13 .",
    "suppose this graph has @xmath19 nodes and @xmath56 directed edges , thus directed edge density @xmath68",
    ". then the number of ordered triples @xmath69 of distinct nodes in @xmath13 which do nt satisfy m1 should be less than the expected number of such triples in the erds - renyi random digraph @xmath70 .",
    "note that , in the latter , each of the @xmath71 possible directed edges is present , independently of the others , with probability @xmath53 .",
    "the expected number of triples not satisfying m1 is thus @xmath72 , since there are @xmath73 possible triples and for a triple @xmath69 to fail m1 , the directed edges @xmath29 and @xmath30 must both be present , while @xmath31 is absent . the first two events each occur with probability @xmath53 and the third with probability @xmath74 .",
    "+   + let us now turn to the flawed treatment of these same concepts in chapter 2 of @xcite .",
    "the problem begins with the author s apparent lack of understanding of transitivity .",
    "his first use of this term is on page 15 , with the following sentence : +    `` _ if the relationship is transitive , it means that if 1 loves 2 , then 2 also loves 3 _ '' .",
    "+   + formally , he is saying the following : +   + m5 .",
    "if @xmath28 are three distinct nodes in a digraph and if the directed edge @xmath29 is present , then so is the directed edge @xmath30 .",
    "+   + this is , obviously , not what transitivity means .",
    "in fact , the motto above is essentially meaningless , as the hypothesis concerns two entities , 1 and 2 , whereas the conclusion concerns a third entity 3 .",
    "there is no a priori relation between 3 and the others , he / she could be anybody . more formally , it is easy to prove that a digraph satisfying m5 and containing at least four nodes and @xmath33 to be distinct , then we would have the same conclusion already for two nodes or more .",
    "] must either be _ complete _ , i.e. : all pairwise directed edges are present , or _",
    "i.e. : all edges are absent then , modulo loops , there are only two possible relations on an @xmath19-element set satisfying m5 , namely the set of relations must either be empty or full .",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath19 , it is known that there are close to @xmath75 transitive relations on an @xmath19-element , that is , relations satisfying the slightly stronger form of m1 where we do nt require @xmath28 to be distinct .",
    "see @xcite . ] .",
    "the motto is therefore totally uninteresting .",
    "further down on page 15 , the term `` transitive '' is used again , but now with the correct meaning .",
    "it then seems to be used properly for a while , until the end of chapter 2 , when on page 26 the original mistake is repeated in the following sentence : +    `` _ relationships are transitive when what holds for a to b , also holds for b to c _ '' .",
    "+   + the fact that the same incorrect statement is made in two different places is already quite worrying .",
    "this uncertainty regarding transitivity may be relevant to the extremely confusing analysis of `` balanced triads '' on page 25 .",
    "partly the confusion arises from the author s failure to distinguish adequately between the notion of transitivity and the more restrictive notion of balance .",
    "more fundamentally , he does nt seem to understand that a balanced triad must be symmetric , and hence that the notion of balance is only really useful for undirected graphs , in other words for the analysis of social networks in which there is an _ a priori _ reason to represent relationships as being mutual .",
    "the high point of the confusion is when he gives triad types 7 and 8 ( see figure 1 ) as examples that `` conform to this hypothesis '' .",
    "it s not entirely clear if `` this '' refers to a transitivity or a balance hypothesis . but",
    "even if he means the former then his assertion makes no sense .",
    "if he means that these triads satisfy m1 , then he is simply wrong , as the table on page 6 illustrates .",
    "if he means that , as digraphs , they satisfy gth above , then he is still wrong .",
    "each of these digraphs contains 3 nodes and 3 directed edges , and 1 ordered triple of nodes failing m1 .",
    "we compare with @xmath70 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the expected number of intransitive triples in the latter is thus @xmath78 , which is less than 1 , so both digraphs fail gth .    in my email correspondence with the author concerning zachary s graph ,",
    "it became clear that he fundamentally misunderstood the concept of balance .",
    "it is to these issues we turn in the next section .",
    "a classical study in the history of sna was performed by wayne zachary , who observed the social interactions between members of a karate club over a period of approximately two years , from 1970 to 1972 .",
    "he finally presented his results in 1977 @xcite in the form of a graph ( see figure 4 at the end of the paper ) showing the `` friendship '' connections between 34 club members near the end of his observations and shortly before a formal split in the club .",
    "in other words , zachary s graph had 34 nodes and each edge represented a pair of club members who were `` friends '' .",
    "crucially , zachary assumed friendships were mutual , so his graph is undirected .",
    "it is also unweighted , though he also considered a weighted version when considering information flow in the network .",
    "the unweighted graph is reproduced on page 28 of @xcite and the author then proceeds to perform a triad census .",
    "recall that , in the usual mathematical terminology , a triad means an induced subgraph on three nodes .",
    "hence , in an undirected graph , there are four possible types ( i.e. : isomorphism classes ) of triads , depending on whether the induced subgraph has 0,1,2 resp . 3 edges .",
    "on page 29 , two main assertions are made , which we cite verbatim : +   + assertion 1 : `` there are 1,575 symmetric dyads in the network ( triad type 3 - 102 in chapter 2 , figure 2 ) ... the number of dyads was much greater than would have been found by chance '' .",
    "+   + assertion 2 : `` there are 45 ( symmetric ) triads in the entire network ( triad type 16 - 300 in chapter 2 , figure 2 ) , also far more than expected by chance '' . +   + unwinding the quantitative statements into standard mathematical terminology , the author is saying that the graph contains 1,575 triads in which one of the three edges is present , and 45 induced triangles .",
    "my own computer - aided check confirmed these numbers .",
    "however i also realised that the second part of the first assertion , that 1-edge triads are overrepresented , is false , indeed very false .",
    "there are 78 edges in this graph , out of a possible total of @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the appropriate comparison is with the erds - renyi random graph @xmath54 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 . by ( 3.1 ) , the expected number of one - edge triads in the latter is @xmath82 that the graph contains nearly 300 fewer one - edge triads seems significant - the probability of @xmath54 containing so few such configurations is extremely small .",
    "hence , assertion 1 is false and the corrected version is as follows : +   + assertion 1@xmath83 : the number of one - edge triads in the karate club graph of zachary is much less than would have been found by chance .",
    "+   + the expected number of induced triangles in @xmath54 is @xmath84 hence assertion 2 above is valid .",
    "after email consultation with the author it gradually became clear where his error with assertion 1 lay .",
    "he had computed expected values , not for @xmath54 , but instead for the directed version @xmath70 .",
    "the configurations with which he was comparing the observed numbers of triads in assertions 1 and 2 were , respectively ,    - those in which one pair of directed edges was present , and all four other possible directed edges absent ( triad type 3 ) ,    - those in which all six directed edges were present ( triad type 16 ) . + let @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively denote the expected numbers of these configurations in @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath87 and @xmath88 these are consistent with the numbers the author showed me via email ( the numbers do not appear in the book ) , which he had obtained using a well - known software package called pajek , in other words he did not use the exact formulas in ( 4.3 ) and ( 4.4 ) .",
    "so it is clear where assertion 1 came from .",
    "the conceptual mistake here is severe : it simply makes no sense to compare an undirected graph with random directed graphs . as the equations above show , the resulting quantitative errors are enormous , and result in a qualitatively wrong conclusion , namely that the number of 1-edge triads is much larger than expected by chance , whereas in fact the complete opposite is true .",
    "it is clear that the author s reason for highlighting assertions 1 and 2 was to illustrate that the graph was well in accordance with the balance hypothesis discussed in the previous section .",
    "assertion 1@xmath83 indicates that , on the contrary , the evidence for this hypothesis is mixed : 3-edge triads are indeed overrepresented , but 1-edge triads are significantly underrepresented . to get a more complete picture",
    ", i also checked with a computer that the numbers of 0-edge and 2-edge triads in zachary s graph are 3971 and 393 respectively .",
    "the corresponding expected numbers , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , in @xmath54 are given by @xmath91 hence , both these types of triads are also overrepresented in zachary s graph , contrary to what the balance hypothesis would predict",
    ". in particular , the overrepresentation of intransitive triads seems significant .",
    "overall then , it is clear that zachary s graph is highly `` unbalanced '' .",
    "after some email correspondence , the author admitted to me his conceptual and quantitative errors .",
    "however , he responded to my suggestion that the unbalanced nature of zachary s graph was an interesting phenomenon worthy of separate attention with the following message : +    `` _ you are absolutely correct in one sense and wrong on balance in another sense .",
    "the graph is undirected and that is the only depiction of the karate club observations that make any sense .",
    "hence the entire discussion of a triad census and balance theory in this context is incorrect since balance theory and the entire body of social network theory that follows from it is only concerned with directed graphs .",
    "heider s original formulation was a directed graph ( he did not have those concepts then ) discussion . balance theory and its entire literature",
    "therefore does not apply to undirected graphs .",
    "_ '' +   + i find these statements rather shocking since , as the previous section makes clear , they demonstrate a complete misunderstanding of the underlying theoretical concept of balance .",
    "i will leave them to the reader to ponder , and instead turn to an investigation of the unbalanced nature of zachary s graph .",
    "in this section , i will present a family of ( random ) graphs which exhibit the same pattern of imbalances in their triad counts as does zachary s graph .",
    "in other words , in these graphs there are fewer 1-edge triads than in erds - renyi graphs of the same edge density , whereas all other triad types are overrepresented .",
    "this family will not exhibit all of the important structural features of zachary s graph but , i shall contend , is still rich enough to satisfactorily explain the unbalanced triad census in the latter .",
    "choosing a family with a simpler structure will allow me to give rigorous proofs without becoming too technical .",
    "we must also make an obvious caveat : zachary s network is just one specific graph , and here we shall be considering an infinite family of random graphs .",
    "the reader should desist from taking any quantitive statements made here and `` plugging in the numbers '' to zachary s graph .",
    "instead , the graphs considered here are meant as idealisations , and are intended to give a conceptual understanding of why zachary s graph is unbalanced in the way it is .    for the remainder of this section ,",

    "more precisely , @xmath130 whereas @xmath131 the situation for 0-edge triads can now be deduced from our previous calculations . since @xmath132 it follows from ( 5.7 ) , ( 5.10 ) and ( 5.13 ) that @xmath133 hence 0-edge triads are also overrepresented in @xmath112 , though not significantly since @xmath134 we can summarise our findings in a theorem , which we shall deliberately state somewhat informally : +   + * theorem 5.3 . * _ let @xmath112 be a noisy constellation , where the parameters @xmath108 satisfy ( 5.1 ) and ( 5.6 ) .",

    "the same is true once @xmath138 .    in the next section",
    "we shall apply these findings to the analysis of zachary s graph .",
    "the graphs considered in the previous section are models for social networks with the following characteristics : +   + ( i ) pairwise relationships are a priori mutual , e.g. : friendships , so that we have an undirected graph . + ( ii ) the network is split into a small number of groups of approximately equal size .",
    "there is more or less no interaction between different groups , the reason for which may depend on the particular network - in particular , the groups may be mutually antagonistic or just indifferent to one another .",
    "+ ( iii ) each group is dominated by one individual , who is the `` star '' of his respective group .",
    "this person maintains a relationship with every other member of his group .",
    "+ ( iv ) relationships between members of the same group , other than the star , are generally weak .",
    "some pairs of individuals do manage to form a relationship , more or less at random .",
    "however , it is the relationships of the groups members to the star which are most important .",
    "+   + in section 5 we demonstrated rigorously that , for a fixed number of groups of equal size , as the size of the groups increases and the frequency of interactions between non - stars is not too large ( see ( 5.6 ) ) , the triad census of such a network will reveal a significant overrepresentation of 2- and 3-edge triads , compared to an erds - renyi random graph with the same edge density . on the other hand ,",
    "1-edge triads will be underrepresented , by an amount which becomes less significant as the density of non - star interactions increases beyond an intermediate threshold ( see ( 5.15 ) ) . 0-edge triads will be slightly overrepresented .",
    "the absolute numbers of @xmath58-edge triads will be decreasing as @xmath58 goes from zero up to three ( again , this statement needs to be qualified if there is only one star - see the last paragraph of section 5 ) . +   + we saw in section 4 that the triad census for zachary s graph revealed the same patterns .",
    "and now we can see why , for the model in section 5 , with @xmath141 , is clearly a reasonable idealisation of zachary s graph . shortly after he constructed his graph , showing the network of friendships between 34 club members , the club formally split into two groups of 17 members each .",
    "each of these two groups had a star , the instructor mr .",
    "hi ( node 1 in the network ) and the club president john a. ( node 34 ) , respectively . indeed , before the split mr .",
    "hi was friendly with 16 members , and all but one of these joined his group afterwards .",
    "john a. was friendly with 17 people beforehand and 15 of these joined his group .",
    "the remaining three people in the network ( nodes 17 , 25 and 26 ) had a relationship with neither star beforehand .",
    "nobody joined a group unless they had a relationship with its star beforehand ( in other words , all crossovers were friendly with both stars beforehand ) .",
    "still , zachary s network is a bit more subtle than a 2-star constellation .",
    "the main reason for this is that there were three other `` minor stars '' who maintained a lot of connections before the split .",
    "node 2 had 9 friends , of whom 8 ended up in mr .",
    "hi s group .",
    "node 33 had 11 friends , of whom 10 ended up in john a s group .",
    "one gets the impression that nodes 2 and 33 acted as `` lieutenants '' for their respective stars in the ideological conflict preceeding the split .",
    "node 3 , on the other hand , seems to have been the nearest the network had to a `` mediator '' .",
    "he had 10 friends , of whom 6 ended up in mr .",
    "hi s group and 4 in john a s .",
    "these five nodes ( 1,2,3,33 and 34 ) completely dominated the network .",
    "when one removes all the edges involving one of these five , then the remaining network on 29 nodes contains only 19 edges , giving an edge density of @xmath142 , compared to an edge density of @xmath143 for the network as a whole .",
    "of these 19 edges , 9 were between members who both ended up in mr .",
    "hi s group and a further 9 were between members who both ended up in john a s group . a solitary edge , @xmath144 , connected members who ended up on different sides and neither of whom were stars or minor stars before the split .",
    "+   + hence , while the interactions in the karate club were certainly a bit more nuanced than in the toy model networks of section 5 , i think it is very reasonable to assert that the latter capture the essence of what was going on in the club just before the split .",
    "what seems particularly significant here is the weakness of the ties between `` ordinary '' club members ( i.e. : non - stars and non - minor stars ) .",
    "interactions between ordinary members who ended up in different factions were almost non - existent ( 1 edge out of a possible @xmath145 ) , but even those within each faction were weak ( 9 edges out of a possible @xmath146 in mr .",
    "hi s faction , and 9 out of a possible @xmath147 in john a s ) .",
    "in this situation , the fact that there were approximately 26 club members who `` minded their own business '' and were not even included in the network analysis assumes greater significance .",
    "had these been included , then the density of friendships between ordinary members would have been a pitiful @xmath148 .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , that on page 454 of @xcite , zachary writes the following : +    `` _ political crisis , then , also had the effect of strengthening the friendship bonds within these ideological groups , and weakening the bonds between them , by the pattern of selective reinforcement . _ '' +   + it is certainly very plausible that the political conflict strengthened the ties of ordinary club members to the various stars and minor stars , and may also have altered the strengths of pre - existing friendships depending on the ideological adherence of the people involved .",
    "such things would be reflected more clearly in a weighted version of the graph , something which zachary indeed presented , but only at the same fixed point in time so that it is not possible to see how the weighted network evolved over time .",
    "however , i think the data hint at a more complex process .",
    "consideration of the overall weakness of ties among ordinary club members , especially if the 26 or so `` neutral '' members are included , suggests the following two possible scenarios :    \\(i ) in the absence of the ideological battle which served to focus members attentions , the underlying network of friendships would have been very weak .",
    "most members were uninterested in socialising with others outside of karate lessons - they generally did not regard a common interest in karate as a sufficient basis for wider friendships .",
    "\\(ii ) the ideological battle actually served to stunt the development of friendships between members who were not at the centre of the conflict , and who began to see the club , not so much as a place to make friends , but as an ideological battleground where loyalty to one side or the other was the main force driving interactions with other members . + whatever the truth of the matter , it seems reasonable to consider the network drawn by zachary , partly as a friendship network and partly as a network of loyalties in a split hierarchy .",
    "+   + this brings us to more general sociological considerations on the notions of transitivity and balance .",
    "status differences seem to be a basic mechanism which mitigate against balance in configurations consisting of three entities or more . to see this , we first step back and consider two people , @xmath21 and @xmath22 say , interacting in isolation .",
    "suppose @xmath21 likes @xmath22 , but @xmath22 , for whatever reason , is not interested in making friends with @xmath21 . in terms of graphs ,",
    "one imagines having a directed edge from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , but no directed edge from @xmath22 to @xmath21 .",
    "intuitively , it seems clear that over time one of the following two things is likely to happen : ( a ) @xmath21 will succeed in winning over @xmath22 as his friend ( b ) @xmath21 will fail in getting @xmath22 to reciprocate his interest , and gradually lose interest in him , moving on to make other friends instead . in case",
    "( a ) , we will have two directed edges , in case ( b ) none . in case ( a )",
    ", we can replace the two directed edges by a single undirected edge .",
    "hence , the following general claim seems reasonable in many situations : +    `` _ pairwise relationships , considered in isolation , tend over time toward being mutual / symmetric . _ '' +   + the friendship between two people may be perfectly mutual as long as they have _ something _ in common , even if they are different characters in many other respects .",
    "suppose , however , that a third person enters the picture",
    ". then the differences between the first two will affect the way they interact with the newcomer , which in turn will upset the mutuality of their own relationship .",
    "consider the following example : we have three people whom we call @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath21 plays football and also plays the piano .",
    "@xmath22 plays football but has no musical talent , whereas @xmath17 plays the piano but has no athletic ability .",
    "if @xmath21 and @xmath22 interact in isolation , then their common interest in football should lead to a `` perfectly mutual '' friendship , as they can simply ignore the other differences between them .",
    "the same applies to @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "but if all three interact together , then tension can arise from everyone s awareness of @xmath21 s higher `` status '' . both @xmath22 and @xmath17",
    "are dependent on @xmath21 for friendship , as they have no basis for befriending one another .",
    "hence , `` power '' becomes a factor in the relationships between @xmath21 and the others , which should be taken into account in any complete analysis of the social relations in the configuration as a whole .",
    "indeed , over time , the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath17 may move from indifference to antagonism , as they compete for @xmath21 s attention . in the terminology of section 3 ,",
    "the triad @xmath149 is intransitive , since two of three edges are present .",
    "what i think is most interesting , from a sociological / psychological viewpoint , is that tensions between @xmath16 and @xmath17 may not be evident if one just observes pairwise interactions in isolation .",
    "people try to `` keep up appearances '' and maintain what look like harmonious relations with their friends , while they simply try to ignore people they may dislike .",
    "it is only by observing the intransitivity of the triad as a whole , especially if it is part of a larger network in which such configurations are common , that the observer might infer a lack of genuine mutuality at the level of pairwise relationships .",
    "note that , in the above example , the higher status of @xmath21 was a natural result of his wider range of talents .",
    "however , the same dynamic could arise if @xmath21 s higher status was imposed from outside , i.e : if he came to occupy a higher place in a wider social hierarchy .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are workmates , and that one day @xmath21 receives a promotion which places him in a managerial role above @xmath22 and @xmath17 . clearly , this has the potential to fray all three pairwise relationships .",
    "however , while @xmath22 and @xmath17 have the option , if worst comes to worst , of not interacting at all , both must maintain some kind of relationship to @xmath21 , he being their boss . in this case , we d still end up with an intransitive triad @xmath149 , with two of three edges present , but it would no longer be appropriate to consider the edges as representing genuinely mutual friendships , but rather as necessary interactions in an externally imposed hierarchy .    the above discussion considered intransitive triads only , but we can extend it to understand how empty triads might come to be overrepresented in a social network . if the network is dominated a small number of high status individuals , then the dynamics described above could stunt the development of friendships between `` ordinary '' network members , as they are drawn to , or compete for the attention of , the various stars .",
    "hence , a lot of empty triads involving ordinary members could arise . +   +",
    "the relevance of these considerations to the karate club seems evident .",
    "on the one hand , recall that zachary observed the interactions of the club members over a long time , more than 2 years . as we argued above",
    ", time seems to be of the essence in promoting mutuality in pairwise relationships , taken in isolation .",
    "this supports the idea that zachary was justified in assuming that friendships in the club were mutual and , hence , in making his graph undirected . secondly , because the club is small , in a 2-year period every pair of members should have actually had the chance to meet and figure out whether they liked each other or not , so the absence of any particular edge in the friendship graph can not reasonably be attributed to the two parties simply never having had a chance to interact .",
    "thirdly , and most importantly , zachary s decision to represent friendships as mutual is based on his actual observations .",
    "we have no reason to doubt that this decision was reasonable , based on his observations of how pairs in fact interacted .",
    "on the other hand , the club was racked by ideological conflict during most of the period of observation .",
    "the two main figures occupied the central positions in the official club hierarchy , they being the instructor and the president respectively . the data clearly suggest that , over time , it was the relationships of the club members to these two stars and their respective lieutenants that drove the interactions in the club as a whole .",
    "friendships between `` ordinary '' club members were very rare overall .",
    "in particular , it is the overrepresentation of intransitive triads ( 393 as against an expected value in @xmath54 of 299 ) that the above analysis picks out as the most salient feature of the triad census in zachary s network .",
    "this strongly hints at widespread tensions , even between members who were ostensibly friends , something which may not have been easy for zachary to observe directly , as people tried to `` keep up appearances '' .",
    "kadushin completely misses this point in his analysis , instead concentrating on the census of 1- and 3-edge triads , which he still manages to analyse incorrectly because of a serious conceptual error .",
    "in previous sections we have laboured to point out that the conventional notion of balance , as expressed by m1-m4 in section 3 , is only really useful to the social network analyst in situations where pairwise relationships are _ a priori _ mutual , so that his default hypothesis is to represent the network as an undirected , and unweighted , graph . to see this",
    "clearly , however , takes some mental effort , and the table on page 6 summarises the results of that effort .",
    "suppose now , however , that we consider digraphs where loops are allowed , i.e. : directed edges of the form @xmath150 from a node to itself .",
    "mathematicians call such an object a _ loop digraph_. then m1-m4 , in their formal expression , are still meaningful if we drop the restriction that the nodes @xmath28 must be distinct",
    ". let m1@xmath83-m4@xmath83 denote the corresponding mottos , with this restriction removed .",
    "for a mathematician , this is a natural step to take : let s see what it gives !",
    "first consider a triple @xmath151 , i.e. : the same node is repeated three times .",
    "then m2@xmath83 implies that the edge @xmath150 should be present .",
    "hence , if a loop digraph is to satisfy m2@xmath83 , a loop must be present at every node .",
    "this property is called _",
    "reflexivity_. next consider a triple @xmath152 , where @xmath153 .",
    "we already know , by m2@xmath83 , that @xmath150 is present .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is present .",
    "then m3@xmath83 suggests that @xmath154 should also be present .",
    "conversely , if we know @xmath154 is present , then m4@xmath83 suggests @xmath29 should be so .",
    "in other words , if a loop digraph is to satisfy m2@xmath83-m4@xmath83 , then it must also be _",
    "symmetric_.    to summarise , if we consider loop digraphs as the basic model for our social networks , and formulate the notion of _ balance _ by m1@xmath83-m4@xmath83 instead , then balance would automatically incorporate both reflexivity and symmetry - m4@xmath83 define a type of relation on the set of nodes in a loop digraph , which is both reflexive , symmetric and transitive , hence a so - called _ equivalence relation_. in a completely balanced loop digraph , there can be at most two equivalence classes - see section 3 . ] .",
    "it s only a slight formal change in the definition , but it might help to avoid the kind of confusion which is evident in @xcite for example . in this context , we could also formulate a _ general balance hypothesis for loop digraphs _ , but this would now be a statement about ordered triples of nodes , rather than induced subgraphs on three nodes ( triads ) . such a hypothesis would assert that , in certain kinds of social networks ( the `` kinds '' being specified by sociological criteria ) , the numbers of ordered triples @xmath69 , of not necessarily distinct nodes , failing any of m1@xmath83-m4@xmath83 should be less than in a random loop digraph of the same edge density . note that , in this setting , if we have @xmath19 nodes and @xmath56 directed edges , then the edge density is @xmath155 , so that the expected numbers of triples failing m1@xmath83-m4@xmath83 in the corresponding random loop digraph are given , respectively , by @xmath156 one may ask why sociologists do nt employ the notion of balance in this modified form , but instead regard it specifically as a property of triads .",
    "i am not a sociologist , so i can not answer that question , but i will hazard a guess , namely that it is because both reflexivity and symmetry , taken on their own merits , are not _ sociological _ ideas about _ collectives _ , but rather purely _ psychological _ ones about _",
    "individuals_. first , consider reflexivity . that a person maintain a friendly relationship with himself seems like a basic psychological survival mechanism implies reflexivity . ] .",
    "this driving force within individuals also promotes symmetry between pairs . when faced with a choice between maintaining one s dignity and continuing a futile pursuit of another s affections",
    ", a person will usually ( though not always ) choose the former option , especially given time .",
    "we also argued this point in section 6 .",
    "once three or more people are involved , however , things can get a lot more complicated .",
    "some explicitly _ social _ factors , such as status , can undermine balance , as we have discussed at length in previous sections . hence , in an intransitive triad , the two low - status members may view their low relative status as a blow to their egos . on the other hand , neither may be willing to let their jealousy of the other jeopardize their friendship with the high status member .",
    "even in a situation where two individuals share a deep mutual antipathy , there may be a good reason for them to maintain a common friendship with a third person , especially if circumstances should one day force them to have some dealings , since then their common friend can act as an effective go - between .",
    "hence , in sna , balance is a useful baseline concept , and the degree to which a given network is balanced or not indicates the extent to which other , explicitly social factors , are at work .",
    "even so , the notion of balance , in its conventional usage , has serious limitations .",
    "it does not take account of the fact that friendships or emnities can vary in strength - in particular , it makes no distinction between emnity and simple indifference .",
    "it is problematic to apply in large networks , where the absence of an edge may be due to the fact that the two individuals involved never got a chance to interact , alternatively to the fact that one or the other already has enough friends and simply has no time for any more .",
    "underlying all this is the problem , stated repeatedly in this piece , that balance is not a useful idea unless the pairwise social relationships are of a kind that they should a priori be considered mutual .",
    "expressing all this in terms of graphs , we would want our graphs to be undirected , unweighted and have a small number of nodes .",
    "let us finish , therefore , by considering weighted digraphs in general .",
    "there seems to an obvious , and useful , notion of `` balance '' in this wider context , but it is quite different from the sociological notion .",
    "namely , one could say that a network is `` balanced '' if , at every node , the total weight of inward edges equals the total weight of outward ones . note that an undirected , unweighted graph is automatically `` balanced '' in this sense , but the converse need not hold .",
    "indeed , an entire network may be `` balanced '' without any induced subgraph at all , on two or more nodes , having the same property .",
    "triad type 10 , consisting of a cycle of three directed edges , is `` balanced '' in this sense , without being either symmetric or transitive .",
    "hence , this notion of `` balance '' is totally different from the sociological one , so much so that one really should use a different name is balanced if , for every induced subgraph @xmath12 of @xmath13 , one has @xmath157 . ] .",
    "the concept seems natural , though , and can be applied , for example , to economic trading networks .",
    "in such a network , the weight of a directed edge @xmath34 would represent the monetary value of all goods which @xmath21 sells to @xmath22 .",
    "`` balance '' then simply means that everyone is spending as much money as they are making .",
    "of course , no real economic system , in particular any system which includes the possibility of loaning money ( a banking system ) , will ever be quite `` balanced '' .",
    "as i explained in the introduction , the intial motivation for writing this piece came after reading the introductory sections of charles kadushin s recent textbook and realising just how flawed his thinking was .",
    "i must admit i am rather baffled that nobody else seems to have yet made the criticisms outlined here .",
    "there are other books on sna which treat the same concepts with much greater care and accuracy , for example scott s book mentioned earlier @xcite .",
    "kadushin s book was published by oxford university press and has been formally reviewed by a number of experts in sna .",
    "it seems to have been distributed widely among teachers and students .",
    "surely it should not have been left to a novice in the field to point out its deficiencies ?",
    "i thank all my co - participants in an interdisciplinary reading course on social network analysis currently being held at chalmers university of technology , without whom this note would never have made it into existence .",
    "in particular , i thank the course organisers , phd students vilhelm verendel , anton trnberg and petter trnberg , who took the initiative to run the course and who selected the literature .",
    "i would also like to thank magnus goffeng for helpful comments on some earlier drafts of the paper ."

    "<S> the notion of `` balance '' is fundamental for sociologists who study social networks . in formal mathematical terms </S>",
    "<S> , it concerns the distribution of triad configurations in actual networks compared to random networks of the same edge density . </S>",
    "<S> on reading charles kadushin s recent book `` understanding social networks '' , we were struck by the amount of confusion in the presentation of this concept in the early sections of the book . </S>",
    "<S> this confusion seems to lie behind his flawed analysis of a classical empirical data set , namely the karate club graph of zachary . </S>",
    "<S> our goal here is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we present the notion of balance in terms which are logically consistent , but also consistent with the way sociologists use the term . </S>",
    "<S> the main message is that the notion can only be meaningfully applied to undirected graphs . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we correct the analysis of triads in the karate club graph . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the interesting observation that the graph is , in a precise sense , quite `` unbalanced '' . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this lack of balance is characteristic of a wide class of starlike - graphs , and discuss possible sociological interpretations of this fact , which may be useful in many other situations . </S>"
