    "the most simple hermitian structure is given by the complex field @xmath0 when equipped with the complex modulus @xmath1 ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "although quite simple , this structure has many applications in the theory of harmonic analysis of finite abelian groups .",
    "indeed the theory of characters for such groups is explicitly based on the existence of a special subgroup of the multiplicative group @xmath3 , the _ unit sphere _ or _ group of roots of unity _ @xmath4 .",
    "this multiplicative group contains an isomorphic copy of each possible cyclic group .",
    "thus it is possible to represent an abstract group @xmath5 as a group @xmath6 of @xmath7-valued functions that preserves the group structure of @xmath5 , called _ characters _ , which is isomorphic to @xmath5 itself .",
    "these characters are the group homomorphisms from @xmath5 to @xmath7 .",
    "moreover the dual group @xmath6 is also an orthogonal basis for the @xmath8-th dimensional vector space of @xmath0-valued functions defined on @xmath5 .",
    "this property makes it possible to carry out a harmonic analysis on finite abelian groups using the ( discrete ) fourier transform which is defined as the decomposition of a vector of @xmath9 in the basis of characters .    given a degree two extension @xmath10 of @xmath11 , the galois field with @xmath12 elements where @xmath13 is a prime number",
    ", we can also define a `` conjugate '' and thus a hermitian structure on @xmath10 in a way similar to the relation @xmath14 .",
    "in particular this makes possible the definition of a unit circle @xmath15 which is a cyclic group of order @xmath16 , subgroup of the multiplicative group @xmath17 of invertible elements . the analogy with @xmath14",
    "is extended in this paper by the definition of @xmath10-valued characters of finite abelian groups @xmath5 as group homomorphisms from @xmath5 to @xmath15 . but",
    "@xmath15 does obviously not contain a copy of each cyclic group .",
    "nevertheless if @xmath18 divides @xmath16 , then the cyclic group @xmath19 of modulo @xmath18 integers embeds as a subgroup of this particular unit circle .",
    "it forces our modular theory of characters to be applied only to direct products of the form @xmath20 where each @xmath21 divides @xmath16 .",
    "in addition we prove that these modular characters form an orthogonal basis ( by respect to the hermitian - like structure @xmath10 over @xmath11 ) .",
    "this decisive property makes it possible the definition of an appropriate notion of fourier transform for @xmath10-valued functions , rather than @xmath0-valued ones , defined on @xmath5 , as their decompositions in the dual basis of characters . in this contribution",
    "we largely investigate several properties of this modular version of the fourier transform similar to classical ones .",
    "traditionally an important cryptographic criterion can be naturally defined in terms of fourier transform .",
    "indeed _ bent functions _ are those functions @xmath22 such that the magnitude of their fourier transform @xmath23 is constant , equals to @xmath8 .",
    "such functions achieve the optimal possible resistance against the famous linear cryptanalysis of secret - key cryptosystems . now using our theory of characters we can translate the bentness concept in our modular setting in order to treat the case of @xmath15-valued functions defined on a finite abelian group @xmath5 . in this paper",

    "the possible connections between usual bent functions ( in particular those with values in a finite - field , see  @xcite ) and our own definition are not all made clear in the present contribution .",
    "this paper should only be seen as a complete presentation of a general framework about modular harmonic analysis , given by a modular character theory and an associated modular fourier transform , that should possibly be used for future research to make interesting connections with cryptographic boolean functions . in this contribution",
    "we limit ourselves to point out that the objects introduced hereafter share many properties with their well - known counterparts .",
    "deeper relationships , if they exist , are outside the scope of our current work .",

    "the set of all such characters of @xmath5 together with point - wise multiplication is denoted by @xmath6 and called the _ dual group of _ @xmath5 . a classical result claims that @xmath5 and its dual are isomorphic this property essentially holds because @xmath7 contains an isomorphic copy of all cyclic groups .",
