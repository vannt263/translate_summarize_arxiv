    "this is @xmath1 10@xmath59 times lower than the observed flux .",
    "the large flux discrepancy comes very probably from our assumption that the interstellar medium of sbs  0335052  is uniform . in all likelihood",

    "the above estimate is very sensitive to the adopted temperature for the gaseous clumps .",
    "this temperature can not be lower than @xmath1 1000 k , since for lower temperatures , the total mass of the clumps needed to account for the observed h@xmath0(1,0)s(0 ) 2.223 @xmath40 m flux would exceed the h i mass of sbs  0335052 .",
    "our _ fuse _ observations are not sensitive to such a clumpy h@xmath0 distribution .",
    "they can only probe diffuse h@xmath0 along the line of sights to the several thousands of uv - bright massive stars in sbs  0335052 .",
    "as in the cases of the bcds i zw 18 @xcite and mrk 59 @xcite , the absence of diffuse h@xmath0 in sbs  0335052  can be explained by the combined effects of a low h i density , a scarcity of dust grains on which h@xmath0 molecules can form , and a large uv flux which destroys molecules .",
    "we now derive the column densities of the heavy elements in the neutral h i envelope of sbs  0335052  by fitting the profiles of the metal absorption lines .",
    "column densities have been calculated by profile fitting using the owens procedure developed by martin lemoine and the _ fuse _ french team .",
    "this code returns the most likely values of many free parameters like the doppler widths and column densities through a @xmath75 minimization of the difference between the observed and computed profiles . the latest version of this code is particularly suited to the characteristics of _ fuse _ spectra . for example",
    ", it allows for a variation of the background level , for an adjustable line spread function as a function of the wavelength domain , and for shifts in wavelength scale .",
    "these are taken as free parameters which depend on the wavelength region and are determined by a @xmath75 minimization .",
    "the derived column densities with their error bars are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we will be quoting 1 @xmath19 error bars throughout the paper .",
    "these have been estimated as usual by considering the @xmath76 increase of the @xmath75 of the fit ( see * ? ? ? * for a full discussion of the fitting method and error estimation with the owens code ) .",
    "these error bars include the uncertainties in the continuum , the intrinsic line widths ( @xmath77 ) , the background residual and the instrumental line spread function .",
    "it is important to remark that the use of different lines with different oscillator strengths of the same species allows us to constrain reasonably well all these quantities . in particular ,",
    "the line width is well constrained by strongly saturated lines . on the other hand , the instrumental line spread function",
    "is mainly constrained by the very narrow lines from h@xmath0 in the milky way .",
    "the final results are obtained from a simultaneous self - consistent fit to all the data . in this final fit ,",
    "the continuum , the background residual , the instrumental line spread function , and the physical parameters of the absorption lines are free parameters .",
    "they are estimated by determining the best @xmath75 in the parameters space .    for each wavelength domain",
    ", we use simultaneously the data from two different channels : the sic  1 and sic  2 channels for wavelengths between 940 and 990   , and the lif  1 and lif  2 channels for wavelengths above @xmath78    ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of the _ fuse _ channels ) .",
    "because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of the sbs  0335052  _ fuse _ spectrum , only lines that are more or less saturated are clearly detected .",
    "this explains the relatively large error bars on the estimated column densities .",
    "however , for most species detected in sbs0335052 , we have for each species several absorption lines from different transitions with different oscillator strengths .",
    "this allows us to obtain reliable column densities despite the saturation of the lines .",
    "for example , several oi lines are detected .",
    "the oi column density is mainly constrained by the profiles of four strong transitions with rest wavelengths @xmath79 , 950.9 , 988.8 , and 1039.2 . for ni",
    ", we detect the well - known triplet at 1034 - 1035 .",
    "the ions nii and nii * have transitions in the wavelength region around 1084 - 1085  which is usually unusable because of its location in the hole between the two lif detectors ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* in the case of izw18 )",
    ". however , here the large redshift of sbs0335052 moves that region out of the hole and allows clear detections of these transitions in the lif1b and lif2a channels .",
    "siii is detected only in the @xmath80  transition , the line at @xmath81  being blended with a strong niii line .",
    "however with an optical depth of @xmath12 , this line does not suffer from much saturation and allows a reliable column density determination , albeit with large error bars . on the other hand , cii which is also detected only in one transition at @xmath82 ,",
    "is strongly saturated .",
    "this makes its column density determination very sensitive to systematic errors and can explain its deviation from the abundance pattern found for other species ( see section  5.2 ) .    with the exception of hi for which the strong damping wings in the lyman@xmath83 line allow a very accurate determination of the column density ,",
    "feii is the species for which we have obtained the highest precision ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "feii has indeed nine clearly detected lines at @xmath84 = 1055 , 1063 , 1064 , 1082 , 1097 , 1122 , 1125 , 1143  and 1145 .",
    "those lines have optical depths ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath130 , which allows a good determination of the feii column density by co - adding the nine separate profiles to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the fit to the co - added continuum and feii line profile .    to better constrain the column densities , we have also used , in addition to the _ fuse _ data , the low resolution _",
    "hst _ spectra obtained with the ghrs spectrograph and the g160 m and g140l gratings by @xcite .",
    "these spectra show absorption lines of cii ( 1334.5   ) , oi ( 1302.2   ) and siii ( 1190.4 , 1193.3 , 1260.4 and 1304.4   ) .    for the species which are detected in both _",
    "fuse _ and _ hst _ spectra ( oi , cii and siii ) , the column densities given in table [ tab1 ] are derived from a simultaneous fit of both spectra .",
    "this assumes that both instruments cover the same spatial regions in the bcd , although the observations have been obtained through very different aperture sizes , 30  in the case of _ fuse _ , and 2  for _ hst_. this assumption is reasonable as the brightest star - forming clusters in sbs  0335052  are confined within a very compact region ( @xmath85 2 , til97 ) , and this region is fully sampled by both _",
    "fuse _ and _ hst _ apertures .",
    "that this is indeed the case is confirmed by the fact that the hi column densities derived independently from the _ fuse _ and _ hst _ spectra are very similar : the _ fuse _ column density is log @xmath11(hi ) = @xmath86 , while the _ hst _ column density is log @xmath11(hi ) = @xmath87 .",
    "the heavy element column densities derived from the _ fuse _ spectra alone and from the _ fuse+hst _ spectra are consistent with each other within the errors . but by using the _ fuse _ and _ hst _ spectra together , we are able to decrease the error bars by a factor of about 2 . for example , the derived column density of c ii using only the _ fuse _ spectrum is log @xmath11(c ii ) ( _ fuse _ ) = 17.68@xmath88 as compared to log @xmath11(c ii ) ( _ hst+fuse _ ) = 17.59@xmath89 . the simultaneous fit of a large set of lines with different oscillator strengths for the same species , and of many different species with the same intrinsic line width allows us to constrain the line broadening parameter ( or doppler width ) @xmath77 . in other words ,",

    "the calculations are stopped in the zone away from the ionizing stars where the temperature drops to 2000 k. the ionization in this zone is very low and it is taken to be the outer edge of the h ii region .",
    "several input parameters need to be set . for a distance of 54.3 mpc and using the aperture - corrected h@xmath83 flux from @xcite",
    ", we set the h@xmath83 luminosity to be @xmath71(h@xmath83 ) = 7.9 @xmath8 10@xmath94 erg s@xmath16 , and the number of ionizing photons to be @xmath11(lyc ) = 1.7 @xmath8 10@xmath95 s@xmath16 .",
    "we use the @xcite stellar atmosphere models and adopt the effective temperature of the ionizing stellar radiation to be @xmath96 = 50000 k , a typical value for low - metallicity high - excitation h ii regions . for the inner radius of the h ii region ,",
    "we adopt @xmath97 = 1.0 @xmath8 10@xmath98 cm . the chemical composition of the h ii region is set by the observed element abundances derived from optical spectroscopy of sbs  0335052  @xcite , except for the carbon , silicon and phosphorus abundances .",
    "for carbon we adopt log c / o = 0.83 , and for silicon log si / o = 1.60 @xcite . as for phosphorus",
    ", we adopt the solar log p / o = 3.42 of @xcite . the adopted abundances are shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we run the cloudy code varying the filling factor @xmath25 and the electron number density @xmath99 in order to obtain the best agreement between the predicted and observed [ o ii ] and [ o iii ] emission lines .",
    "we find that if @xmath99 varies in the ranges 7  13 @xmath2 and @xmath25 in the range 0.17  0.29 , then we have adequate agreement between the observed and model line intensities .",
    "the best model is found for a filling factor @xmath25 = 0.22 and an electron number density @xmath99 = 10 @xmath2 .",
    "the optical line intensities of the best model are shown in table [ tab3 ] , where we compare them with the observed ones @xcite .",
    "the error bars of the model line intensities ( and those of the model parameters in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab4 ] ) correspond to the maximum range of their values .",
    "there is good general agreement between observed and model line intensities , giving us confidence that the photoionization model is correct . the predicted total hydrogen ( neutral and ionized ) column density in the h ii region is @xmath11(h",
    "i + h ii ) = 4.93 @xmath8 10@xmath13 @xmath14 or log @xmath11(h i + h ii)= 21.69 .",
    "as expected for a h ii region model , most of the hydrogen is ionized : @xmath11(h ii ) = 4.89 @xmath8 10@xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "the column density of the neutral hydrogen is two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "the model also predicts a column density of molecular hydrogen made via h@xmath100 @xmath11(h@xmath0 ) = 1.91 @xmath8 10@xmath101 @xmath14 , more than six orders of magnitude lower than our observational upper limit .",
    "we now compare the column densities of heavy elements predicted by cloudy with those derived from the _ fuse _ and _ hst _ spectra .",
    "the cloudy predicted column densities are given in table [ tab4 ] . those relevant to the _ fuse _ observations are also repeated in column 3 of table [ tab1 ] . in table [ tab4 ] , @xmath102 is the radially averaged ratio of the ion number to the total number of a particular element , e.g. , @xmath11(fe@xmath103)/@xmath11(fe ) .",
    "the predicted log @xmath11(x ) of species x is then derived as log @xmath11(x ) = log @xmath11(h  i+h ii ) + log x@xmath104/h  log @xmath102(x@xmath104 ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding cloudy predicted column densities are plotted as open circles .",
    "there are two features that should be noted .",
    "first , the observed and calculated relative variations from ionic element to ionic element show the same pattern .",
    "while this simply reflects the relative cosmic abundances of the considered species , retrieving that pattern from the data does show the consistency of the derived column densities for different species despite the low signal - to - noise ratio of our _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "second , the majority of the calculated h ii column densities are systematically smaller by more than one order of magnitude than the observed column densities .",
    "this implies that the _ fuse _ column densities arise mainly in the h i neutral envelope , and not in the gas ionized by young stars .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the ratio of the column densities of all ions relative to that of o i. as for the column density of o i , it is given relative to that of h i. there is general good agreement between the ratios of the _ fuse _ column densities ( filled circles ) and the ratios of the elements abundances in the h ii region ( stars ) .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath11(c ii)/@xmath11(o i ) ratio which is a factor of 30 larger than the c / o ratio in the h ii region . as discussed in section 5.1 , the c ii column density",
    "is derived from a single strongly saturated line and is probably overestimated .    of special interest",
    "is the @xmath11(o i)/@xmath11(h i ) ratio .",
    "the ionization potential of oi is very similar to that of hi , and there is an efficient charge exchange between oii and hi .",
    "hence there is a strong coupling between the oxygen and hydrogen ionization fractions . in the neutral gas ,",
    "the oi / hi ratio can therefore be considered as a very good proxy for the o / h ratio and hence it is a very good tracer of metallicity .",
    "we obtain log @xmath11(o i)/@xmath11(h i ) = 5.04@xmath120.55 or [ o i / h i ] = 1.70 .",
    "this is to be compared with log o / h = 4.70@xmath120.01 for the ionized gas in sbs  0335052  @xcite .",
    "thus , within the errors , the metallicity of the neutral gas in sbs 0335052 is comparable to that of its ionized gas .",
    "the much lower metallicity of the neutral gas of sbs 0335052 obtained by @xcite from _ hst _ observations is not correct as it is based on the erroneous assumption that the o i , si ii and s ii lines are not saturated .",
    "how does the metallicity of the h i gas in sbs 0335052 compare with those determined in the neutral ism of other bcds ?",
    "such a determination has been made for four other bcds . for the most metal - deficient bcd known ,",
    "i zw 18 with a log ( o / h)@xmath105 of the ionized gas equal to 4.82@xmath120.01 @xcite , @xcite have obtained log ( o / h)@xmath106 of the neutral gas = 5.37@xmath120.28 while @xcite derived the higher value log ( o / h)@xmath106 = 4.7@xmath120.35 .",
    "the discrepancy between the two values may be due to the fact that , to derive o / h , @xcite use the strongly saturated oi line at @xmath107   which , at the redshift of i zw 18 , is blended with terrestrial airglow . for i",
    "zw  36 @xmath108 mrk 209 with log ( o / h)@xmath105 = 4.23@xmath120.01 @xcite , @xcite derived log ( o / h)@xmath106 = 4.5@xmath109 . for the bcd mrk 59 with log ( o / h)@xmath105 = 4.01@xmath120.01 @xcite , @xcite have derived log ( o / h)@xmath106 = 5.0@xmath120.3 . as for the bcd ngc 1705 with log ( o / h)@xmath105 = 3.79@xmath120.05 @xcite , @xcite have derived log ( o / h)@xmath106 = 4.6@xmath120.3 .",
    "thus if we disregard the low value of @xcite , the ionized gas metallicity of the five different bcds observed by _ fuse _ span a log ( o / h)@xmath105 range from 4.82 to 3.79 , i.e. a 1.03 dex spread . on the other hand , the metal content in their h i envelopes varies in the range log ( o / h)@xmath106 = 5.0 - 4.5 , or [ o / h]@xmath106 = 1.7 - 1.2 , using the revised solar abundance ( o / h)@xmath110 = 3.34 of @xcite , i.e. a 0.5 dex spread .    at first glance , the metallicity spread of the neutral gas component appears to be only slightly lower than that of the ionized gas component .",
    "however a real difference appears once the error bars of the metallicity measurements are considered .",
    "the metallicities of the ionized gas , log ( o / h)@xmath105 , are determined from emission - line spectra with a precision of 0.01 dex ( 0.05 dex for ngc 1705 ) , while those of the neutral gas , log ( o / h)@xmath106 , derived from absorption spectra , have considerably larger error bars varying from 0.3 dex for mrk 59 and ngc 1705 to 1.0 dex for i zw 36 .",
    "these large error bars are in fact responsible for the apparent large metallicity spread of the neutral gas .",
    "if we take into account the error bars , the log ( o / h)@xmath105 values do vary over a 1.0 dex range while the log ( o / h)@xmath106 measurements are consistent with a single constant value .",
    "the spread of the log ( o / h)@xmath106 measurements around their mean value @xmath111 can be evaluated by the sum of their squared normalized differences which , for five measurements , follow a @xmath112 law with four degrees of freedom .",
    "we obtain a very low dispersion @xmath113 ^ 2 =   1.40 $ ] .",
    "there is more than 84% chance that @xmath112 is larger than this value , supporting our contention that all five measurements are consistent with a single value of log ( o / h)@xmath106 .",
    "the fact that the most metal - deficient bcd ( i zw 18 ) has about the same log ( o / h)@xmath106 as the most metal - rich bcd ( ngc 1705 ) studied thus far by _ fuse _ suggests that the metallicities of the neutral and ionized gas are unrelated . as discussed in the introduction , the two most metal - deficient bcds known , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052",
    "have been suggested to be bona fide young galaxies , with an age not exceeding 500 myr [ see @xcite for a discussion of the age of i zw 18 and til97 , @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the age of sbs 0335052 ] .",
    "thus the h i envelopes that surround these two bcds may be expected to be truly primordial , i.e. not to contain heavy elements .",
    "our study here of sbs  0335052 and previous work on i zw 18 show that this is clearly not the case , that the h i envelopes in these two bcds have been enriched previously to a level [ o / h]@xmath106 = 1.7 - 1.4 , perhaps by population iii stars .",
    "this speculation appears to be supported by the oxygen abundances derived by @xcite for the intergalactic medium using ultraviolet absorption lines in ly@xmath4 absorbers .",
    "those authors derive a [ o / h ] range of 2.0 to 1.1 [ we have corrected their values using the o solar abundance of @xcite ] , which overlaps well with that derived thus far for the neutral ism in five bcds .",
    "we present _ fuse _ far - uv spectra of the second most metal - deficient blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy known , sbs 0335052 with an ionized gas oxygen abundance log o / h = 4.70@xmath120.01 . because this galaxy is one of the best candidates for being a young galaxy in the local universe , with an age not exceeding @xmath1 100 myr , the study of the abundances in its neutral hydrogen envelope is of special interest as it can shed light on the possible metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium by population iii stars several hundred million years after the big bang .",
    "we have obtained the following results :    \\1 .",
    "no h@xmath0 absorption lines are detected .",
    "we set a 3@xmath19 upper limit for diffuse h@xmath0 in sbs  0335052  of 3.7@xmath810@xmath20 @xmath14 for @xmath22 = 500 k and 5.5@xmath810@xmath20 @xmath14 for @xmath22 = 1000 k. the absence of diffuse h@xmath0 is due to the combined effects of a low hi density , a large uv flux which destroys h@xmath0 molecules and a low metallicity which makes grains on which to form h@xmath0 molecules scarce .",
    "the non - detection of diffuse h@xmath0 contrasts with the detection of h@xmath0 emission lines in near - infrared spectra of sbs  0335052 .",
    "this implies that the detected h@xmath0 must be clumpy , and associated only with the dense star - forming regions .",
    "these clumps should be denser than @xmath1 1000 @xmath2 and have a temperature greater than @xmath1 1000 k. for such dense clumps , h@xmath0  self - shielding can protect the h@xmath0 molecules from dissociating uv - photons .",
    "each clump has a mass less than @xmath1 5@xmath810@xmath114 @xmath10 .",
    "there should be at least @xmath1 2000 clumps , accounting for @xmath3 5% of the total h i mass .",
    "the oi / hi ratio in the h i gas ( log @xmath11(o i)/@xmath11 ( h i ) = 5.04@xmath120.55 is similar , within the errors , to the o / h ratio derived from optical emission lines in the hii region of sbs  0335052  ( log o / h = 4.70@xmath120.01 ) , i.e. the metallicity of the neutral gas is comparable to that of the ionized gas .",
    "thus although sbs  0335052  is a probable young galaxy , its neutral envelope is not pristine .",
    "there exists a noteworthy similarity between the o / h ratio observed in the h i gas of sbs0335052 ( with log ( o / h)@xmath105 of the ionized gas equal to 4.70 ) and the ones seen in the h i gas of other bcds for which similar _ fuse _ studies have been carried out , i zw 18 [ log ( o / h)@xmath105 = 4.82 ] , i zw 36 [ log ( o / h)@xmath105 = 4.23 ] , mrk59 [ log ( o / h)@xmath105 = 4.01 ] and ngc 1705 [ log ( o / h)@xmath105 = 3.79 ] . in all five bcds , log o / h of the neutral gas is in the range 5.0 - 4.5 ( or [ o / h ] = 1.7 - 1.2 ) , although the ionized gas of ngc 1705 is some 10 times more metal - rich than that of sbs  0335052  and i zw 18 .",
    "this suggests that the metallicities of the neutral and ionized gas components are unrelated .",
    "we may speculate that the neutral gas in these five bcds has been enriched to a common metallicity level of log ( o / h ) @xmath1 5 by population  iii  stars .",
