    "in recent years , an enormous amount of exciting cosmological data have appeared , accompanied by theoretical statements about early galaxy formation and the first massive stars .",
    "many of these statements were reactions to first - year ( wmap-1 ) results ( kogut et al.2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) .",
    "these papers inferred a high optical depth to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and suggested early reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "other conclusions came from simplified models and assumptions about the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , atomic / molecular physics , radiative processes , and prescriptions for star formation rates and escape of photoionizing radiation from protogalaxies .    in this paper , we focus on the reionization epoch , defined as the redshift @xmath0 when the igm becomes nearly fully ionized over most of its volume ( gnedin 2000 , 2004 ) .",
    "our knowledge about reionization comes primarily from two types of observations : h  i ( ly@xmath10 ) absorption in the igm and optical depth of the cmb .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the  gunn - peterson \" ( ly@xmath10 ) absorption toward high - redshift quasars and galaxies imply that h  i reionization occurred not far beyond @xmath15 ( becker 2001 ; fan 2002 , 2006 ) , and that he  ii reionization occurred at @xmath16 ( kriss 2001 ; shull 2004 ; zheng 2004 ) .",
    "third - year data from wmap ( spergel 2006 ; page 2006 ) suggest that reionization might occur at @xmath17 , although large uncertainties remain in modeling of the cmb optical depth .",
    "the wmap and ly@xmath10 absorption results are not necessarily inconsistent , since they probe small amounts of ionized and neutral gas , respectively .",
    "in addition , both the h  i absorbers and ionized filaments in the  cosmic web \" ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) are highly structured at redshifts @xmath18 and affect the optical depths in ly@xmath10 .",
    "for example , in order to effectively absorb all the ly@xmath10 radiation at @xmath19 requires a volume - averaged neutral fraction of just @xmath20 ( fan 2006 ) .",
    "simulations of the reionization process ( gnedin 2004 ; gnedin & fan 2006 ) show that the transition from neutral to ionized is extended in time between @xmath21 . the first stage ( pre - overlap ) involves the development and expansion of the first isolated ionizing sources .",
    "the second stage marks the overlap of the ionization fronts and the disappearance of the last vestiges of low - density neutral gas .",
    "finally , in the post - overlap stage , the remaining high - density gas is photoionized .",
    "the final drop in neutral fraction and increase in photon mean free path occur quite rapidly , over @xmath22 .",
    "initial interpretations of the high wmap-1 optical depth were based on models of  sudden reionization \" , neglecting scattering from a partially ionized igm at @xmath5 .",
    "the revised optical depths , @xmath23 ( spergel 2006 ; page 2006 ) also assume a single step to complete ionization ( @xmath24 at redshift @xmath0 ) , although spergel ( 2006 ) explored a two - step ionization history , resulting in a broader distribution of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the @xmath25 curves for two - step ionization provide little constraint on the redshift of reionization , or on an igm with low partial ionization fractions , @xmath26 , as we discuss in   3 .",
    "figure 3 of spergel ( 2006 ) shows that the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath0 are somewhat degenerate , each with a long tail in the likelihood curves .",
    "this emphasizes the possible importance of contributions to @xmath7 from ionizing uv photons at @xmath5 from early massive stars and x - rays from accreting black holes ( ricotti & ostriker 2004 ; begelman , volonteri , & rees 2006 ) .",
    "models of the extended recombination epoch ( seager , sasselov , & scott 2000 ) predict a partially ionized medium at high redshifts , owing to residual electrons left from incomplete recombination .",
    "these electrons produce additional scattering , @xmath28 ( @xmath14 10700 ) .",
    "these effects must be computed in cmb radiation transfer codes such as cmbfast and recfast , but only a portion of this scattering affects the large angular scales ( @xmath29 ) where wmap detects a polarization signal .",
    "x - ray preionization can also produce cmb optical depths @xmath30 ( venkatesan , giroux , & shull 2001 , hereafter vgs01 ; ricotti , ostriker , & gnedin 2005 ) .    in   2.1 ,",
    "we show that a fully ionized igm from @xmath8 = 0 to the reionization epoch at @xmath31 ( gnedin & fan 2006 ) , produces optical depth , @xmath32 , nearly half the wmap-3 value .",
    "therefore , the high - redshift ionizing sources are limited to producing an additional optical depth , @xmath9 . in   3 , we discuss the resulting constraints on the amount of star formation and x - ray activity at @xmath33 and limits on star formation in minihalos .",
    "the igm probably has a complex reionization history , with periods of extended reionization for h  i and he  ii ( venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ; cen 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; hui & haiman 2003 ) . because @xmath7 measures the integrated column density of electrons ,",
    "there are many possible scenarios consistent with the current ( wmap-3 ) level of cmb data .",
    "to elucidate the dependence of cmb optical depth on the epoch of reionization ( redshift @xmath0 ) , we integrate the electron scattering optical depth , @xmath34 , for a homogeneous , fully ionized medium out to @xmath0 . for instantaneous , complete ionization at redshift @xmath0",

    "we also add the small ( @xmath44 ) contribution from doubly - ionized helium ( he  iii ) at redshifts @xmath45 ( shull 2004 ) .",
    "we assume a helium mass fraction by mass @xmath46 and define @xmath47 ( he fraction by number ) .",
    "the critical density is @xmath48  g  @xmath49 where @xmath50/100  km  s@xmath51  mpc@xmath51 ) .",
    "the above integral can be done analytically : @xmath52       \\left [ \\ { \\omega_m ( 1+z_r)^3 + \\omega_{\\lambda } \\}^{1/2 } - 1 \\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath53 . for large redshifts , @xmath54 , and the integral simplifies to @xmath55 ( 1+z_r)^{3/2 } \\approx ( 0.0533 ) \\left [ \\frac      { ( 1+z_r)}{8 } \\right ] ^{3/2 }   \\ ; .\\ ] ] here , we substituted the wmap-3 parameters ( spergel 2006 ) : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , and adopted a primordial helium abundance @xmath59 ( izotov & thuan 1998 ; olive & skillman 2001 ) . a recent paper ( peimbert 2007 ) suggests a revised @xmath60 based on new he  i atomic data .    from the approximate expression ( eq .",
    "3 ) , we see that @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is nearly independent of the hubble constant , since @xmath62 while the combined parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are inferred from d / h , cmb , and galaxy dynamics .",
    "the scaling with @xmath65 cancels to lowest order ; a slight dependence remains from the small @xmath66 term in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "if we invert the approximate equation ( 3 ) , we can estimate the primary reionization redshift , @xmath67^{2/3}$ ] , where we scaled to the value , @xmath68 , expected for full ionization back to @xmath11 . as discussed in   2.2 ,",
    "this is approximately the wmap-3 value of optical depth ( @xmath69 ) reduced by @xmath70 .",
    "this extra scattering may arise from high-@xmath8 star formation , x - ray preionization , and residual electrons left after incomplete recombination .",
    "the latter electrons are computed to have fractional ionization @xmath71 between @xmath8 = 10700 ( seager 2000 ) .",
    "inaccuracies in computing their contribution therefore add systematic uncertainty to the cmb - derived value of @xmath7 .",
    "partial ionization may also arise from the first stars ( venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 , hereafter vts03 ) and from penetrating x - rays produced by early black holes ( vgs01 ; ricotti & ostriker 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "these additional ionization sources contribute electron scattering that must be subtracted from the wmap-3 values .",
    "they will lower the reionization redshift , @xmath72 , derived ( spergel 2006 ) in the absence of partial ionization at @xmath5 , and they may bring the wmap-3 and gunn - peterson results into agreement for the epoch of complete reionization .    in our calculations , described in   3",
    ", we make several key assumptions .",
    "first , we assume a fully ionized igm out to @xmath11 , accounting for both h@xmath73 and ionized helium .",
    "( helium contributes 8% to @xmath7 , assuming he  ii at @xmath74 and an additional @xmath75 for he  iii at @xmath45 ) .",
    "second , we investigate the effects of igm partial ionization at @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in computing the contribution of residual electrons at high redshifts , we adopt the concordance parameters from the wmap-3 data set .",
    "the cmb optical depth is formally only a @xmath76 result , which may change , as wmap produces better determinations of the matter density , @xmath77 , and the parameters , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , that govern small - scale power .",
    "both @xmath78 and @xmath80 have well - known degeneracies with @xmath7 in cmb parameter extraction ( spergel 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , their derived values may change in future cmb data analyses , especially as the constraints on @xmath7 continue to evolve .",
    "in addition , inaccuracies in the incomplete recombination epoch and residual ionization history , @xmath6 , add uncertainties to the cmb radiative transfer , the damping of @xmath81-modes , and the polarization signal used to derive an overall @xmath7 .",
    "we now discuss the contribution of residual electrons in the igm following the recombination epoch at @xmath82 .",
    "scattering from these electrons is significant and is normally accounted for in cmb transport codes such as cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) through the post - recombination igm ionization history , @xmath6 .",
    "however , a number of past papers are vague on how the ionization history is treated , which has led to confusion in how much residual optical depth and power - damping has been subtracted from the cmb signal .",
    "modern calculations of how the igm became neutral have been done by seager ( 2000 ) , although their code ( recfast ) continues to be modified to deal with subtle effects of the recombination epoch and the atomic physics of hydrogen ( @xmath83 ) two - photon transitions ( w. wong & d. scott , private communication ) .    to illustrate the potential effects of high-@xmath8 residual electrons ,",
    "we have used numbers from figure 2 of seager ( 2000 ) , the top - panel model , which assumed a cosmology with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88  k. at low redshifts , @xmath89 , just before reionization , they find a residual electron fraction @xmath90 .",

    "more recent recombination calculations ( w. y. wong & d. scott , private communication ) using wmap-3 parameters ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath46 ) find somewhat lower values , @xmath98 with @xmath99 . we attribute the lower @xmath100 to the faster recombination rates arising from their higher assumed baryon density , @xmath101 , compared to @xmath102 in seager ( 2000 ) .    to compute the electron - scattering of the cmb from these  frozen - out \" electrons , we use the same integrated optical depth formula ( equation 1 ) , in the high-@xmath8 limit , where @xmath103 \\approx ( c / h_0 ) \\omega_m^{-1/2 } ( 1+z)^{-5/2}$ ] .",
    "we integrate over the residual - electron history , from @xmath104 back to a final redshift @xmath105 , to find @xmath106        \\int_{z_r}^{z_f } ( 1+z)^{1/2 } \\ ;",

    "residual post - recombination electrons produce a substantial optical depth from @xmath17 back to @xmath142 , which uniformly damps all angular scales .",
    "however , their effect on the te and ee power is considerably less on large angular scales ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "thus , we can characterize a portion of the wmap-3 observed optical depth , @xmath143 , through known sources of ionization .",
    "the  visible ionized universe \" out to @xmath144 accounts for @xmath145 , while high-@xmath8 partial ionization could contribute anywhere from @xmath146 to 0.06 .",
    "we therefore assume that an additional optical depth , @xmath9 , can be attributed to star formation and early black hole accretion at @xmath5 .",
    "our calculations represent an important change in the derivation of @xmath0 from @xmath7 , suggesting that the amount and efficiency of high-@xmath8 star formation need to be suppressed .",
    "this suggestion is ironic , since wmap-1 data initially found a high @xmath147 ( spergel 2003 ) implying a surprisingly large redshift for early reionization , ranging from @xmath148 at 95% confidence ( kogut 2003 ) .",
    "these results precipitated many investigations of star formation at @xmath149 , some of which invoked anomalous mass functions , very massive stars ( vms , with @xmath150  @xmath151 ) , and an increased ionizing efficiency from zero - metallicity stars ( vts03 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; cen 2003 ; ciardi , ferrara , & white 2003 ; sokasian 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "tumlinson , venkatesan , & shull ( tvs04 ) disputed the hypothesis that the first stars had to be vms .",
    "they showed that an imf dominated by 10  100  @xmath151  stars can produce the same ionizing photon budget as vms , generate cmb optical depths of 914% , and still be consistent with nucleosynthetic evidence from extremely metal - poor halo stars ( umeda & nomoto 2003 ; tumlinson 2006 ; venkatesan 2006 ) .",
    "although the igm recombination history , @xmath6 , is included in calculations of cmbfast and in cmb parameter estimation , the best - fit values of @xmath7 from wmap-3 and earlier cmb experiments have been attributed exclusively to the contribution from the first stars and/or black holes at @xmath152 .",
    "the contributions from post - recombination electrons ( @xmath153 ) have not always been subtracted from the data .",
    "this post - recombination contribution was relatively small in some earlier models of reionization ( zaldarriaga 1997 ; tegmark & silk 1995 ) that explored optical depths of @xmath154 and suggested reionization epochs up to @xmath155 .",
    "however , with current data indicating late reionization , it becomes particularly important to consider contributions to @xmath7 prior to the first sources of light .",
    "the new wmap-3 results find a lower @xmath7 , but they also suggest less small - scale power available for reionizing sources , owing to lower normalization parameters , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "this reduction is somewhat offset by the reduction in spectrum tilt from @xmath158 ( wmap-1 ) to @xmath159 ( wmap-3 ) .",
    "alvarez ( 2006 ) argue , from the lower values of @xmath7 and @xmath78 , that both wmap-3 and wmap-1 data require similar ( high ) stellar ionizing efficiencies .",
    "haiman & holder ( 2003 ) use the lower @xmath7 to suggest that massive star formation was suppressed in minihalos .",
    "our results on a lower @xmath160 make these requirements even more stringent , as we now quantify .",
    "semi - analytic and numerical models of reionization ( ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2002a , b ; vts03 , haiman & holder 2003 ) show that the efficiency of ionizing photon injection into the igm can be parameterized by the  triple product \" , @xmath161 . here",
    ", @xmath162 represents the star - formation efficiency ( the fraction of a halo s baryons that go into stars ) , @xmath163 is the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon of star formation , and @xmath164 is the fraction of these ionizing photons that escape from the halo into the igm .",
    "we can now use our calculations to constrain the amount of high-@xmath8 star formation through the product of these three parameters , henceforth referred to as the  efficiency \" . for the ionization history in equation ( 5 ) , we set @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the space - averaged baryon clumping factor of ionized hydrogen , @xmath167 .",
    "we assume that @xmath168 is the same for h  ii and he  iii .",
    "the factor @xmath169 is the fraction of baryons in collapsed halos , computed through the press - schechter formalism ( as in vts03 ) for the cosmological parameters from wmap-3 .",
    "we assume that @xmath161 is constant with redshift .",
    "there is surely some dependence of each of these parameters on the halo mass and environment ( haiman & bryan 2006 ; ricotti & shull 2000 ) .",
    "since we have already parameterized the intrahalo recombinations through @xmath164 , we account for the loss of ionizing photons on igm scales through @xmath168 in two forms : ( 1 ) a power - law form with slope @xmath170 from the semi - analytic work of haiman & bryan ( 2006 ) ; and ( 2 ) the numerical simulations of kohler , gnedin & hamilton ( 2006 ) , using their case c ( overdensity @xmath171 for the large - scale igm ) for @xmath172 , the recombination clumping factor corresponding to our definition of @xmath168 . in the latter case ,",
    "the clumping factor is almost constant ( @xmath173 ) until the very end of reionization .",
    "together , these two different cases provide bounds on the range of possible values .    with these assumptions , we can use equation ( 5 ) and the allowed additional optical depth , @xmath9 , to constrain the ionizing efficiency of the first stars . in figure 1 , we plot the efficiency as a function of @xmath160 , for star formation in ly@xmath10-cooled halos ( virial temperature @xmath174 k ) and in h@xmath175-cooled minihalos ( @xmath176 k ) .",
    "we consider the two clumping factors from kohler ( 2006 ) and haiman & bryan ( 2006 ) . for @xmath177 = @xmath178",
    ", we indicate the efficiencies corresponding to two cases of interest , assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) : ( 1 ) @xmath179 for a metal - free imf ( 10140 @xmath180 ) that agrees with both cmb and nucleosynthetic data ; and ( 2 ) @xmath181 for a present - day imf ( 1 - 100 @xmath180 ) . note that @xmath182 is consistent with the wmap-3 inferrence , @xmath183 , if the photons arise from zero - metal stars ( tumlinson 2006 ) .",
    "these values of @xmath163 were derived ( tvs04 ) from the lifetime - integrated ionizing photon production from various stellar populations and imfs and used as inputs in cosmological reionization models .",
    "figure 1 shows that fairly modest efficiencies of massive star formation are consistent with limiting the ionizing contribution of minihalos to @xmath184 .",
    "this is consistent with suppression of star formation and ionizing photon production in mini - halos ( haiman & bryan 2006 ) .",
    "much larger efficiencies , close to those of metal - free stellar populations , are required for larger halos .",
    "interestingly , it seems to make little difference what form is assumed for the clumping factor , @xmath168 , in constraining the ionizing efficiency of the first stars .",
    "this is largely a statistical effect arising from the insensitivity of the _ average _ optical depth , or electron column density , averaged over many beams passing through a clumpy medium .",
    "the cmb optical depth can also constrain the level of x - ray preionization from high - redshift black holes . ricotti ( 2005 )",
    "were able to produce large optical depths , @xmath185 , using accreting high-@xmath8 black holes with substantial soft x - ray fluxes .",
    "their three simulations ( labeled m - pis , m - sn1 , m - sn2 ) produced hydrogen preionization fractions @xmath186 between @xmath187 and @xmath188 , with large co - moving rates of star formation , @xmath189 mpc@xmath190  yr@xmath51 , and baryon fractions , @xmath191 ",
    "@xmath192 accreted onto black holes .",
    "any significant contribution to @xmath7 from x - ray preionization requires @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , the lower value of @xmath7 from wmap-3 reduces the allowed x - ray preionization and black - hole accretion rates significantly compared to these models .",
    "ricotti ( 2005 ) demonstrated that high optical depths ( @xmath185 ) could be achieved by black - hole x - rays . in their models ,",
    "the igm at @xmath5 was highly ionized ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "in this limit , there were few x - ray secondary electrons and most of the x - ray energy went into heating the ionized medium .",
    "by contrast , the wmap-3 optical depth suggests that the igm was much less ionized at @xmath5 .    relating the effects of x - ray ionization from early black holes to a @xmath160 and",
    "a related x - ray production efficiency factor is less straightforward compared to the star formation case , for the following reasons .",
    "first , unlike ionization by uv photons , x - ray ionization is non - equilibrium in nature and the timescales for x - ray photoionization at any epoch prior to @xmath195 typically exceeds the hubble time at those epochs ( vgs01 ) .",
    "a one - to - one correspondence between x - ray production at an epoch , and the average efficiency of halos at that epoch is more difficult to establish relative to the uv photon case .",
    "in addition , x - ray ionization ( whether from stars or black holes ) , at least initially when @xmath196 0.10.2 , will be dominated by secondary ionizations from x - ray - ionized helium electrons rather than from direct photoionization .",
    "this may therefore constrain the physical conditions in the igm ( e.g. , the level of he ionization ) rather than those in the parent halo , when we attempt to translate a @xmath160 into an x - ray ionization efficiency .",
    "thus , it may be difficult to make precise inferences about the black hole density and accretion history from @xmath7 .",
    "we define an efficiency parameter , @xmath197 , for x - rays analogous to the previous case for massive star formation . here , @xmath197 is the product of the average fraction of baryons in black holes ( in halos at @xmath33 ) and the number of x - ray photons produced ( per baryon accreted onto such black holes ) .",
    "we assume that the clumping factor ( @xmath168 ) and escape fraction ( @xmath164 ) are roughly unity for x - rays , given their high penetrating power relative to uv photons .",
    "thus , we define @xmath198 for x - rays , where electrons come from h@xmath73 , he@xmath73 , and he@xmath199 .",
    "we assume that each x - ray photon produces @xmath20012 hydrogen ionizations , primarily through secondary ionizations from x - ray photoelectrons ( vgs01 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the allowed additional optical depth , analogous to the constraints of figure 1 , for x - ray efficiency in both ly@xmath10-cooled halos and minihalos .",
    "a comparison with figure 1 reveals that x - rays are capable of much higher ionization efficiency relative to pop  iii or pop  ii star formation .    in summary , we have shown that the revised ( wmap-3 ) values of cmb optical depth , @xmath1 , lead to a more constrained picture of early reionization of the igm .",
    "approximately half of the observed @xmath7 comes from a fully ionized igm back to @xmath31 .",
    "the remainder probably arises from the first massive stars and from accretion onto early black holes at @xmath5 .",
    "some of the observed @xmath7 may come from scattering from residual electrons left from recombination ; inaccuracies in computing this ionization history add systematic uncertainty to the cmb inferred signal .",
    "we have assumed extra scattering , @xmath201 at @xmath5 , and used this to constrain the effciciencies for production and escape of ionizing photons , both from the first massive stars ( figure 1 ) and early black holes ( figure 2 ) .    in both cases ,",
    "the picture is of a partially ionized igm at redshifts @xmath202 . for x - ray pre - ionization by early black holes , equation ( 6 )",
    "can be used to provide an estimate of the effects of partial reionization . between redshifts",
    "@xmath203 and @xmath204 , an igm with ionized fraction @xmath205 ( ricotti 2005 ) would produce @xmath206 , which is a significant contribution to the observed @xmath1 .",
    "ricotti ( 2005 ) suggested a large @xmath207 and pushed their black - hole space densities and accretion rates to large values in order to reach the wmap-1 estimates of @xmath208 . because such large values of @xmath7 are no longer required , the black hole densities and igm ionization fractions are likely to be considerably less .",
    "all these constraints depend heavily on uncertain parameterizations of the efficiency of star formation and ionizing photon production .",
    "however , with more precise measurements of cmb optical depth from future missions , there is hope that more stringent constraints on high-@xmath8 star formation and black - hole accretion will be possible .",
    "we are grateful to david spergel , licia verde , rachel bean , and nick gnedin for useful discussions regarding the interpretation of wmap data and numerical simulations .",
    "we thank douglas scott and wan yan wong for providing their calculations of recombination history .",
