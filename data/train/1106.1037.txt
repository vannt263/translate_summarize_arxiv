    "for the @xmath0 system , there is evidence in lattice qcd @xcite , at least for static quarks , that the hamiltonian , is @xmath1 with the potential being given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the two possible meson - meson potentials and @xmath5 is the tetraquark sector potential .",
    "we call @xmath6 the triple flip - flop potential .    in the tetraquark configuration ,",
    "a single connected string is formed .",
    "this string is formed from five segments of string as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ potentials ] ( see @xcite for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "we have studied the colour field configurations for the tetraquark .",
    "the results are shown on fig .",
    "[ chromofields ] .",
    "it is hard to solve this hamiltonian , so we will instead solve a simplified potential model which contains the essential ingredients of the triple flip - flop potential , but depends on a smaller number of variables .",
    "we will do the following approximations .",
    "first we will consider that all the quarks and antiquarks have an equal mass , while neglecting the exchange effects .",
    "secondly , we will consider only the confining ( linear ) part of the potential and that the quarks are non - relativistic .",
    "finally , we will also reduce the number of variables of the model .     and",

    "we now simplify the triple flip - flop potential , in order to reduce it to a two - dimension problem , similar to the one of a cherry in a broken glass . to simplify the triple flip - flop potential , we assume that the quark - quark distance @xmath9 and the antiquark - antiquark distance @xmath10 are equal @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we only need to consider the variable @xmath12 and @xmath13 in our model .    in this way , only one meson - meson branch is relevant , and the simplified flip - flop potential is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 this potential is depicted in the right side of fig .",

    "since the hamiltonian , is invariant for independent rotations of @xmath12 and @xmath7 , we have two conserved angular momenta @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "so , the wavefunction can be written as @xmath20 and the schrdinger equation([schro ] ) becomes @xmath21    we now place the system in a lattice and discretize the second derivatives the usual way .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are used at the origin , for the wavefunction to be regular and at the box boundary for convenience .",
    "we then evaluate the eigenstates of the system .",
    "only a few of them are bound or semi - localized states .",
    "they can be identified by calculating @xmath22 and comparing it to the box size .    in the following results , we consider only @xmath23 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "only continuum states are found .",
    "however , for @xmath25 , we are able to found some semi - localized states , such as the one depicted on the left side of fig .",

    "[ finitediff_res ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    we try to calculate the phase shifts using the finite differences results , by calculating the functions @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath29 and , then by fitting the long range limit @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain the results in the right side of fig .",
    "[ finitediff_res ] .",
    "as we can see there , the results become irregular when a second channel is open , due the interference of the different channels , and so we ca nt use this method to calculate the phase shifts .",
    "for that , we had to resort to a scattering theory approach .",
    "by expanding the wavefunction as @xmath31 we obtain the coupled channel schrdinger equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the eigenvalues of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    considering the scattering from the channel @xmath37 to the channel @xmath38 , we have asymptotically @xmath39 , if the channel @xmath38 is open , otherwise vanishing .",
    "the @xmath40 can be computed by considering the outgoing solutions of the eq .",
    "( [ schro_cc ] ) , @xmath41 .",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath42 also we can obtain the phase shifts by studying the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions .",
    "we can describe the scattering process with four quantum numbers : the scattering angular momentum @xmath43 , the confined angular momentum @xmath44 and the initial and final states radial number in the confined coordinate @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we now compute the phase shifts , in order to search for resonances in our simplified flip - flop model .",
    "the energies in the plots will be given in terms of @xmath48 , which is the energy scale of the problem .    in fig .",
    "[ deltas ] we see the phase shifts for different values of @xmath44 , from the radial ground state @xmath49 .",
    "as can be seen , no resonance is formed for @xmath24 , but for @xmath50 and @xmath51 one resonance is formed since the phase shift has a jump of @xmath52 .",
    "this is somewhat expected , since the centrifugal barrier has the effect of maintaining the diquarks separated , while increasing the stability of the system .",
    "we also see a bound state for @xmath26 , which agrees with the results obtained with the finite differences method and presented in fig .",
    "[ finitediff_res ] .",
    "the phase shifts for scattering for @xmath53 and different @xmath44 and for @xmath24 and different values of @xmath54 are also presented .     and",

    "greater reduced masses could increase the binding of the system . which is in fact what we observe in fig .",
    "[ redmass ] . for @xmath24 we can see a resonance that is destroyed for masses as low as @xmath58 , while for @xmath50 the resonance is always present .",

    "the results are given in table [ widthtables ] .",
    "the width is larger for large angular momentum and small quark mass .    using this results to estimate the physical scale of our decay widths , we obtain , in the @xmath50 state , a decay width @xmath64 for light quarks ( @xmath65 gev ) . for the charm quark",
    "we obtain @xmath66 and for the bottom quark , the estimated width is @xmath67 .    in the @xmath51 state",

    "we have observed the formation of a resonance for non null @xmath44 , and even a bound state for @xmath26 .",
    "so , we conclude that a higher angular momentum favours the formation of resonances and bound states , in agreement with karliner and lipkin @xcite . extrapolating this results to the real world",
    ", it seems plausible the existence of tetraquarks with high angular momentum .    the formation of resonances and bound states is also favoured by low quark masses in our model .",
    "this happens since a low quark mass produces a higher binding energy which increasing the meson masses and so favouring the localization of resonances and bound states .",
