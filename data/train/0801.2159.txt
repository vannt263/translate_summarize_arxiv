    "the galactic bulge underwent an intense burst of star formation early in the formation of the galaxy , leading to a very different stellar population and chemical evolution history than found in the milky way disk or halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , massive stars may dominate the pollution at almost all metallicities , leading to unique abundance patterns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similar events are thought to mark the formation of other galactic spheroids , making the bulge stellar population a template for interpreting extragalactic observations . as a result of its unique formation history in the galaxy ,",
    "the bulge has been the subject of intensive study .",
    "the detection of rr lyrae stars @xcite first indicated that the bulge contained old stars . with deeper photometry , the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) of the bulge was detected .",
    "@xcite found a mean age of 11 - 14 gyr for stars in baade s window , with a negligible fraction of stars with ages @xmath2 5 gyr .",
    "photometry reaching more than 2 magnitudes below the msto with",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ confirmed the generally old nature of the bulge @xcite , although @xcite included a reminder that a young metal - rich population has similar msto colors and luminosities to an older , more metal - poor population .",
    "therefore , deriving ages reliably from photometry of the msto requires adequate knowledge of the bulge metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , specifically for the msto stars .",
    "however , because of the faintness of those stars , the measurement of the bulge mdf has historically relied on giants .",
    "since the discovery of both m giants and rr lyr stars , it has been known that the bulge giants span a wide range in metallicity .",
    "low - dispersion spectra provided the first quantitative measure of the mdf @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured indices from low - dispersion spectra of 268 k giants ( both red clump stars and first ascent giants ) to derive a mean metallicity @xmath3 log@xmath4(n@xmath5/n@xmath6)@xmath7  log@xmath4(n@xmath5/n@xmath6)@xmath8 ) @xmath9}\\rangle = -0.11 $ ] , with a dispersion of 0.46 dex .",
    "recalibration by @xcite based on high - resolution spectra of 15 stars in common with the @xcite sample reduced the mean metallicity to @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath9}\\rangle = -0.21 $ ] from low - dispersion near - infrared spectra for 72 m giants in the inner bulge .",
    "the good agreement between @xcite result and the recalibrated @xcite result is somewhat surprising . at the bright end of the giant branch ,",
    "only metal - rich first ascent giants become m giants .",
    "however , both k giants and m giants become red clump stars , and lower luminosity metal - rich giants are k stars as well . therefore , the inclusion of red clump stars and fainter giants in the @xcite sample make the biases in their sample more similar to those of the @xcite study .",
    "@xcite measured both the mdf of the bulge and the age of the stars using deep photometry of the bulge in the optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "they constructed the m@xmath11 and ( v - k)@xmath12 color magnitude diagram for a low - reddening window at ( @xmath13)=(0.277 , @xmath146.167 ) . because the slope of the red giant branch ( rgb ) in these colors depends on the metallicity , rgb stars with different metallicities fall on different parts of the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "they could therefore use their photometry to derive the mdf of 503 giants by comparing the positions of bright ( m@xmath15 ) rgb stars with globular cluster fiducials of known metallicity . after correcting for small biases in their mdf caused by their magnitude cutoff , they find an mdf with a peak at [ m / h]@xmath16 , a sharp cutoff at [ m / h]@xmath17 and few stars with [ m / h]@xmath18 .",
    "adopting the metallicities derived from the giants for the msto dwarfs , they estimated that the bulge is coeval with the halo and argued that the lack of stars above the prominent msto of the bulge ruled out a significantly younger population .",
    "these measurements of the bulge giant mdf can be improved by metallicity measurements from high - dispersion measurements of many stars in several fields throughout the bulge .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have obtained a total of @xmath19 k giant spectra at ( r@xmath2020,000 ) in 4 bulge windows .",
    "they confirm the metal - rich nature of the bulge .",
    "with such a metal - rich population having been reached so quickly after star formation began , the bulge is expected to have a distinct chemical evolution compared to other galactic populations , such as the halo or the disk because , for example , the contributions of longer - lived polluters , such as type ia supernovae ( sne ) or low - mass agb stars , should be small .",
    "indeed , @xcite measured high [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios in giants , in particular , high [ mg / fe ] for [ fe / h ] values up to solar , arguing for little type ia sn contribution of fe compared to the thick or thin disks .",
    "@xcite confirmed the overall enhancement in [ mg / fe ] and strengthened the conclusion of @xcite that the other @xmath1 abundance ratios do not track [ mg / fe ] exactly .",
    "[ o / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] begin to decrease around [ fe / h]=0 , while [ mg / fe ] does so at supersolar [ fe / h ] .",
    "@xcite suggested that metallicity - dependent type ii sn yields could explain the different behaviors of the @xmath1 elements .",
    "@xcite explained the low [ o / mg ] ratios in metal - rich bulge giants through a different metallicity - dependent mechanism : wolf - rayet winds leading to less effective o production in metal - rich massive stars . by [ fe / h]@xmath200.2 , all the [ @xmath1/fe ]",
    "ratios have begun to decline , probably indicating the introduction of large amounts of fe from type ia sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several studies have looked at the abundances of the light elements na and al in the bulge , two elements whose production should depend on the metallicity of the massive stars that exploded as type ii sne . @xcite measured na in 7 k and m giants and found the predicted increase in [ na / fe ] and [ na / o ] in the most metal - rich stars .",
    "@xcite found supersolar [ al / fe ] at all metallicities and , for [ fe / h ] @xmath210 , enhanced [ na / fe ] compared to the ratios in disk stars .",
    "interestingly , at higher metallicities , the scatter in [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] increased and became larger than could be explained by observational errors . interpreting the na and al abundances as the result of type ii sn production may be problematic .",
    "the surface abundances of al and na have been shown to be increased by large amounts of internal mixing in metal - poor globular cluster stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the products of proton - capture reactions deep inside the star are mixed up to the surface , leading to enhancements in these two elements",
    ". however , @xcite argued that the c and n abundances in the giants they studied were consistent with only mild mixing and , therefore , that the high na and al had to be due to the overall chemical evolution of the bulge .",
    "@xcite also found evidence for mild mixing in giants , affecting c and n , but not o , na , or al .    finally , there is little information on the neutron - capture elements in the bulge .",
    "the absorption lines for these elements are concentrated in the blue part of the optical spectrum , where the crowding from fe , cn , and other lines is severe .",
    "near - ir spectra have essentially no lines of these elements . while there are a few lines of ba in the red ,",
    "these lines in metal - rich giants are so saturated that reliable measurements are very difficult . as a result , only the neutron - capture element eu has published results so far .",
    "@xcite found [ eu / fe]@xmath210 in bulge giants , which is likely because of the production of eu in the r - process .",
    "measuring additional neutron - capture element abundances would test this idea , because the r - process is better at making some elements ( e.g. , eu ) than others ( e.g. , ba ) .",
    "our knowledge of the metallicity and abundance ratios of bulge stars has generally been confined to the bright giants , which are usually the only ones accessible to high - resolution observations . but studying the dwarfs has several advantages .",
    "their abundances of the elements such as c and n are unaffected by dredge - up processes on the giant branch .",
    "we can measure elements , such as s and zn , that not measured in giants , because the hotter temperatures of the dwarfs decrease the strength of cn and increase the strength of certain atomic lines .",
    "in addition , it is critical to know the metallicity of stars at the msto to accurately measure the ages from their color and luminosity .",
    "finally , individual ages can be assigned to dwarf stars near the turnoff .",
    "the advent of large surveys to identify and follow - up microlensing events , such as the microlensing observations in astrophsycis ( moa ) collaborationiabond / alert / alert.html ] , the optical gravitational lens experiment  ogle / ogle3/ews / ews.html ] ( ogle ) , the microlensing follow up networkmicrofun/ ] ( @xmath22fun ) and the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ) , provides an opportunity to study otherwise unobservable bulge dwarfs . during high - magnification microlensing events , it is possible to obtain high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of faint stars with a huge savings in observing time : a factor @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnification and @xmath25 is the number of magnitudes below sky of the unmagnified star . in @xcite",
    ", we reported the detailed abundances for a highly - magnified bulge dwarf , , which from a 15 minute exposure at magnification @xmath26 , was shown to be one of the most metal - rich stars ever observed .",
    "it also provided the first measurements of s and cu in the bulge . here",
    "we present a high - resolution spectrum of the bulge g - dwarf moa-2006-blg-99s , taken at magnification @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we respond the challenge : `` ask not what microlensing can do for stellar spectroscopy  ask what stellar spectroscopy can do for microlensing . ''",
    "there is one important way that the spectroscopic study of bulge dwarfs can benefit microlensing .",
    "whenever a source approaches or transits a `` caustic '' ( line of infinite magnification ) caused by the lens , one can measure @xmath28 , the ratio of the angular source radius to angular einstein radius @xmath29 , from the microlens lightcurve .",
    "then @xmath30 is inferred from the dereddened color and magnitude of the source to yield @xmath31 , which in turn provides important constraints on the lens properties . because spectroscopy is not normally available for these microlensed sources , the dereddened color and magnitude are estimated by comparing the source position on an instrumental color - magnitude diagram with that of the clump and then assuming that the bulge clump is similar to the local clump as measured by _",
    "hipparcos _ @xcite .",
    "this procedure undoubtedly suffers some statistical errors and could suffer systematic errors as well .",
    "for example , the bulge clump may have a different color from the local one .",
    "high - resolution spectra of an ensemble of microlensed bulge sources will test this procedure for both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "for ogle-2006-blg-265s , the standard microlensing procedure yielded @xmath32 , whereas @xcite obtained @xmath33 from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "this difference hints at a possible discrepancy , but only by repeating this procedure on a number of dwarfs can this be confirmed .",

    "intensive photometric observations were then carried by several collaborations , including @xmath22fun , primarily with the aim of searching for planets @xcite .",
    "results of that search will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the event actually peaked on 23 july ( hjd 2453940.349 ) at @xmath37 .",
    "one of us ( bsg ) happened to be at the clay 6.5-m telescope at the magellan observatory when he received the flurry of @xmath22fun emails describing this event .",
    "he then interrupted his normal program to obtain a 20-minute exposure of this event at the beginning of the night , just after peak , when the magnification was @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately , the atmospheric transparency was poor , and the observation had to be interrupted after 1089 seconds when the cloud cover became too thick .",
    "conditions cleared several hours later , and he obtained two 20-minute exposures centered at ut 02:09:36 and ut 02:30:34 24 july , when the magnification was @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we base our results on these higher quality spectra .",

    "the temperature derived from the lines was very uncertain because the abundances derived from individual lines were poorly determined because of the s / n of the spectrum .",
    "the excitation equilibrium favored a higher temperature ( + 200k ) with an uncertainty of 300k.given the uncertainties , this temperature is in agreement with the balmer line temperature .",
    "next , we measured the microturbulent velocity , @xmath46 , by ensuring that the abundances derived from the lines do not depend on their reduced ew .",
    "our best fit value was @xmath46=1.5 km / s . changing @xmath46 by @xmath470.3 km / s gave marginal fits to the data , and we adopt that as our uncertainty in @xmath46 .",

    "for , the spectroscopic and photometric temperatures were different , suggesting possible systematic errors in estimating the dereddened color and magnitude of the source star .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , quantifying any systematic errors is important for obtaining the most accurate information about microlensing events , and additional data will be crucial for quantifying any systematic error .",

    "our measurement of log @xmath48 and [ m / h ] , on the other hand , depended strongly on the other model atmosphere parameters . because we set the gravity by ionization equilibrium , log @xmath48 depends on t@xmath43 , @xmath46 , and [ m / h ] , as well as the abundance measured from the and lines .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in log @xmath48 depends on the uncertainties in those quantities .",

    "the total uncertainty in log @xmath48 is 0.66 dex and in [ m / h ] is 0.21 dex .",
    "we ran the and ews through a series of models : @xmath47 200k , @xmath47 0.3 km / s , @xmath470.3 dex for log @xmath48 , and 0.13 dex in [ m / h ] ( smaller because of the limits of the kurucz grid ) , and calculated the difference in fe abundance with these different model atmospheres .    finally , we calculate uncertainties using modified equations ( a5 ) and ( a20 ) from @xcite .",
    "we considered the covariance between t@xmath43 : log @xmath48 , t@xmath43 : [ m / h ] , log @xmath48 : [ m / h ] , @xmath46 : log @xmath48 , and @xmath46 : [ m / h ] .",

    "the high metallicities of these two dwarfs is surprising given that work on giants has indicated an average metallicity near solar .",
    "in figure  [ fig : mdf1 ] , we compare the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of the two dwarfs with several mdfs based on studies of giant stars .",
    "the mdf of @xcite , which is based on high - resolution analysis of m giants and should be biased _ toward _ the highest metallicity objects , lacks any giants as metal - rich as these dwarfs .",
    "this is particularly notable , since the work of @xcite on k giants with low - dispersion spectra shows some extremely metal - rich stars .",
    "a complicating factor is the possible presence of a metallicity gradient in the bulge . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdf2 ] , we compare the metallicities of the dwarfs with mdfs derived by @xcite from high - resolution spectra for giants in three bulge fields : 4 , 6 , and 12away from the galactic center . the inner field is more metal - rich than the outer .",
    "however , these two dwarfs are located 6.5 ( ) and 4.9 ( ) away from the galactic center , and therefore gradients can not explain their anomalously high metallicities .",
    "these results hint that the mdfs of the bulge giants and dwarfs may be different . whether this is true can be established by more observations of bulge dwarfs and by resolution of the discrepancies among the mdfs derived for giants , particularily between the low - dispersion and high - dispersion studies . because the microlensed dwarfs are found at a range of distances from the galactic center , comparison of the giant and dwarf mdfs",
    "also depends on measuring the metallicity gradient ( and the size of deviations from that gradient ) in the bulge .",
    "ideally , the mdf for giants in the same field as the microlensed dwarf would be measured .              with our measurements of t@xmath43 , log @xmath48 , and [ fe / h ] from spectroscopy",
