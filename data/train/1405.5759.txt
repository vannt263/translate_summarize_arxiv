    "to discover and understand dusty galaxies at the highest redshifts , the emission of [ cii ] 158  is the single most important atomic line feature because it is the strongest far - infrared line in most sources @xcite and also provides the best opportunity for high redshift determinations and source diagnostics using submillimeter and millimeter spectroscopic observations .",
    "already , for example , [ cii ] has been measured with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) in sources with 4 @xmath8 z @xmath6 6 @xcite , demonstrating that large scale star formation extends to high redshifts .",
    "the [ cii ] line should be a diagnostic of star formation because it is primarily associated with the photodissociation region ( pdr ) surrounding starbursts @xcite .    the objective of our studies is to compare characteristics of [ cii ] emission with classifications and luminosities of sources determined from mid - infrared spectra , so that [ cii ] can be used alone as a quantitative diagnostic when no other spectroscopy is available .",
    "this is especially important for dusty sources at high redshifts , when the rest frame far - infrared can be observed in submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths , but other rest frame wavelengths are not observationally accessible .",
    "our observations consist of a sample of 130 sources which include a wide range of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) through starburst ( sb ) classifications , using [ cii ] observations made with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; poglitsch et al . 2010 ) on the @xmath0 space observatory @xcite .",
    "the [ cii ] results are compared to mid - infrared spectroscopic diagnostics determined with the @xmath1 infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "the sample is chosen to minimize effects of differing spatial resolutions when comparing @xmath0 far infrared observations with @xmath1 mid - infrared slit spectroscopy by choosing sources that are unresolved .",
    "sample selection , classification , and results for [ cii ] fluxes for 112 sources are described in @xcite ; hereinafter  paper 1 \" .    in that paper",

    ", we concluded that [ cii ] line flux measures the same photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) associated with starbursts as the pah feature @xcite and , therefore , measures the starburst component of any source . a calibration of star formation rate ( sfr ) was derived by comparing [ cii ] luminosity @xmath5)$ ] to total infrared luminosity @xmath10 using the precepts of @xcite , with the result that log sfr = log @xmath2)$ ] - 7.08 @xmath9 0.3 , for sfr in m@xmath3 yr@xmath4   and @xmath5)$ ] in l@xmath3 .",
    "a comprehensive summary is given by de looze et al.(2014 ) of all available [ cii ] measurements ( including those in paper 1 ) and their use as a sfr indicator through calibration with continuum luminosities ( including both ultraviolet and infrared ) .",
    "their emphasis is on determining uncertainties within the sfr calibration arising from cosmic variance and on discussing why differences can arise among sources . for starbursts ,",
    "the summary results are very similar to ours in paper 1 , with the same calibration and similar scatter for the relation between @xmath5)$ ] and sfr .",
    "the uncertainties arising from cosmic variance among sources do not include systematic uncertainties in the assumptions used to transform total radiated luminosities from a star forming region into sfrs .",
    "it is important , therefore , to determine independent calibrations of @xmath2)$ ] compared to sfr which depend on different precepts .",
    "the primary objective of the present paper is to obtain an independent calibration of @xmath2)$ ] as a sfr indicator by comparing [ cii ] luminosities with mid - infrared [ neii ] and [ neiii ] emission line luminosities , calibrated for sfr by @xcite , using new measurements of high resolution irs spectra ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "in addition , we determine the [ cii ] line to continuum ratio at 158 and use this to calibrate sfr from the continuum luminosity at 158 ( section 3.3 ) ; this allows an independent comparison to a previous calibration of sfr from 160 luminosity @xcite . as part of these analyses",
    ", we also provide new [ cii ] observations of an additional 18 sources and provide new redshifts for all sources determined using only the [ cii ] emission line .",
    "as summarized in paper 1 , the sample selected for [ cii ] observations with @xmath0 pacs derives from sources having both @xmath1 irs spectra and full photometry with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) , and for which f@xmath11(irs)/f@xmath11(iras ) comparisons at 25 indicate that sources are unresolved ( because comparable source fluxes are measured with the slit of the irs compared to the large beam of iras ) .",
    "sources encompass a wide range of classification , from agn through composite to starburst , derived uniformly from the strength of the pah 6.2 feature in irs spectra .    our agn / starburst classification , based on strength of the 6.2 pah feature ,",
    "is described in paper 1 and in @xcite .",
    "the classification criterion is similar to that used in many previous studies , although different authors use different pah features and different methods for measuring strength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the primary motive for using the 6.2 feature instead of the stronger 11.3 feature is to compare with sources having sufficiently high redshifts that the 11.3 feature is not visible in irs spectra .",
    "our measurement is simply the observed ew(pah 6.2 ) determined in a uniform fashion without any modeling assumptions regarding the mix of pah features and/or the true level of underlying dust continuum .",
    "this measurement is made with the smart software for irs spectra @xcite , and the ew(pah 6.2 ) is determined using a gaussian fit to the pah feature and a linear fit to the continuum beneath the feature within the range 5.5 to 6.9 .",
    "measurements from irs low resolution spectra and the empirical correlation of ew(pah 6.2 ) with source classification are given in @xcite .",
    "all spectra are available in the cassis spectral atlas @xcite .     12.81 to [ oiv ] 25.89 emission line fluxes compared to equivalent width of pah 6.2 feature in .",
    "dividing lines show the division into classifications based on ew(pah 6.2 ) used throughout this paper .",
    "crosses are sources classified as pure agn , asterisks as pure starbursts , and circles are composites with contribution from both .",
    "triangles are lower limits , in which the [ oiv ] feature is not measured . ]    for purposes of the present paper , the most important use of these diagnostics is to select sources confidently classified as pure starbursts so these can be used to determine various relations among [ cii ] , infrared luminosity , pah luminosities , and emission line luminosities that apply to pure starburst sources .",
    "these relations provide the calibration of sfr .",
    "the composite and agn sources then illustrate changes that occur with increasing fractions of agn luminosity added to the starburst .",
    "the classification utilized in the following discussion is summarized in figure 1 using sources discussed below having both pah and emission line measurements . the quantitative division among  pure agn \" and  pure starbursts \" , with the intermediate ",
    "composite \" systems is illustrated .",
    "the ew boundaries which are shown derive by combining optical classifications and mid - infrared template spectra to determine classification boundaries as summarized in @xcite and in paper 1 .",
    "starbursts have ew(pah 6.2 ) @xmath12 0.4 , composites have 0.1 @xmath8 ew(pah 6.2 ) @xmath8 0.4 , and agn have ew(pah 6.2 ) @xmath8 0.1 .",
    "pure starbursts are defined as systems with @xmath12 90% of the mid - infrared luminosity arising from a starburst , and pure agn as systems with @xmath12 90% of the mid - infrared luminosity arising from the agn ( paper 1 ) .",
    "composites have mixtures of these components . for the full sample of 130 sources in this paper , these criteria give 60 agn , 36 composites , and 34 starbursts .",
    "the summary of results in figure 1 comparing the ratio of [ neii ] 12.81 to [ oiv ] 25.89 emission line fluxes with the classification derived from pah ew illustrates the conclusions from many previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) that pah strength correlates with level of ionization as seen in emission lines , which confirms the agn / starburst classification derived from pah strength . both the ew(pah 6.2 ) from the starburst pdr and the relative [ neii ] emission line strength from the starburst hii region decrease as the starburst component decreases , because the agn adds additional hot dust continuum in the mid - infrared that diminishes ew(pah 6.2 ) and also adds increasing strength of the higher ionization [ oiv ] ( the ionization potential required to produce neii is 21.6 ev compared to 55 ev to produce oiv ) .",
    "the [ cii ] observations are described in paper 1 , where examples of observed line profiles are illustrated .",
    "all [ cii ] observations were made using the @xmath0 pacs instrument @xcite for line spectroscopy in point source chop nod mode with medium throw .",
    "[ cii ] line fluxes are obtained by summing fluxes in the nine central equivalent spatial pixels , or  spaxels \" , produced by the pacs image slicer . a correction communicated to us by the pacs calibration team",
    "is applied for flux that would fall outside these spaxels for an unresolved source , correcting the 9 spaxel flux by a factor of 1.16(@xmath13/158 ) @xmath14 , with wavelength @xmath13 depending on redshift .",
    "data reduction in paper 1 was done with version 8 of the @xmath0 interactive processing environment ( hipe ) , and the  pacsman \" software @xcite is used for fitting line profiles and continuum .    an additional 18 sources were subsequently observed in program lsargsya - ot2 .",
    "these [ cii ] fluxes were derived in a similar way and are given in table 1 .",
    "results for the total sample of 130 sources are summarized in table 2 where [ cii ] fluxes for the 112 sources from paper 1 are also reproduced .",
    "line fluxes are determined from the flux within a fitted gaussian profile except for 12 sources ( noted in table 2 ) for which the [ cii ] profile is asymmetric or shows component structure .",
    "for these 12 , the total line flux is the integrated flux including all components rather than the flux within a single gaussian fit .",
    "all results are determined with hipe version 8 .",
    "the new sources were also extracted with hipe version 10 , which has different calibration from version 8 . by reducing new sources with both v8 and v10 , we find a systematic flux difference such that v8 fluxes are a factor of 1.07 brighter compared to v10 . this difference is noted in table 1 , but fluxes listed for the new sources arise from v8 to be consistent with results in paper 1 .",
    "pacs observations of the [ cii ] line are made in a continuous scanning mode that produces a `` data cloud '' containing a large number of separate flux measurements within individual wavelength elements because the spectrometer is read out every 1/8 s ( poglitsch et al . 2010 and pacs observer s manual ) during the total integration time of 579 s for these observations .",
    "the pacsman uncertainties at each wavelength are determined from the dispersion among the individual measurements within the data cloud .",
    "the s / n of the overall profile fit is determined using the uncertainties within these individual wavelength elements . examples of profiles and fits are shown in paper 1 , including a noisy profile with plotted uncertainties .",
    "uncertainties of individual [ cii ] emission line fluxes are determined by the signal to noise ( s / n ) of the profile fit by pacsman in the brightest spaxel , with uncertainties listed in paper 1 and table 1 individually by source .",
    "s / n is defined as the ( line flux)/(uncertainty in line flux ) arising from the profile fitting . if s / n @xmath8 3 , fluxes were listed as upper limits in paper 1 and are shown as upper limits in plots within the present paper . no new sources in table 1 are limits .",
    "s / n for the remaining sources indicates a median line flux uncertainty of @xmath9 15% .",
    "the systematic uncertainty for [ cii ] fluxes depends on pacs flux calibration , estimated as @xmath9 12% in the pacs spectroscopy performance and calibration document picc - kl - tn-041 .",
    "( the offset we find between hipe v8 and v10 reductions is within this uncertainty . )",
    "combining these two sources of uncertainty yields a typical combined uncertainty of @xmath9 20% for [ cii ] fluxes .    in paper 1 , redshifts were listed based on previously determined optical redshifts , verified by irs mid - infrared emission lines . in tables 1 and 2 of the present paper , we list new redshifts derived from the [ cii ] line only .",
    "redshifts generally agree to @xmath15 0.002 , but the [ cii ] redshifts are given here to allow further study of any systematic differences between [ cii ] emitting regions and optical or mid - infrared regions .",
    "uncertainties in measured [ cii ] line velocities are dominated by centering effects , as described in the pacs observer s manual .",
    "depending on precisely where within a spaxel the source is centered , the observed wavelength of the emission line can change by @xmath6 @xmath9 40 km s@xmath4 . to estimate",
    "empirically the uncertainties arising both from this effect and from fitting the line profile , we compare in figure 2 the [ cii ] centroid velocity within the brightest spaxel relative to the velocity within the second brightest spaxel ( only for sources in which both spaxels have s / n @xmath12 3 ) .",
    "this plot does not include the 12 sources noted in table 2 with asymmetric or component structure to the [ cii ] line profile , because these sources may really have spatially different components on a sub - spaxel scale .    from figure 2 ,",
    "the brightest spaxel systematically gives the same velocity as other spaxels ; the median velocity offset between the brightest and second brightest is less than 1 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the random errors from source position and profile fitting are determined as the one sigma dispersion among the velocity differences shown between the brightest spaxel and the second brightest , which gives a dispersion of @xmath9 50 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this is our measurement of empirical uncertainty for the measured [ cii ] velocities .",
    "this dispersion is much larger than the formal centroiding uncertainty of the line fit for the brightest spaxel , typically only a few km s@xmath4 in the pacsman fits , indicating that velocity uncertainties are dominated by positional effects of the source within the spaxel .",
    "the final redshift measurement which is reported in tables 1 and 2 is that of only the brightest spaxel .    in section 3.3 , the line to continuum ratio ( equivalent width , ew ) for the [ cii ] line is discussed .",
    "this is important for understanding the relation between far infrared dust continuum reradiation and the origin of the [ cii ] emission line .",
    "uncertainties in ew arise from both the [ cii ] emission as uncertainties in the line flux , and as uncertainties in the level of the underlying continuum . usually , the latter is a much larger source of uncertainty because source continua are faint compared to the background .",
    "these two uncertainties as determined by pacsman are summed quadratically to give total uncertainty in the ew which is listed in table 2 .",
    "comparisons of [ cii ] with pah fluxes in paper 1 and below are made using the 11.3 pah feature because this is the strongest pah feature in irs spectra .",
    "the flux ratios for the new sources are given in table 1 , using measurements of the 11.3 feature taken from @xcite as determined with a gaussian fit to the pah feature and a linear fit to the continuum beneath the feature from 10.5 to 12 .",
    "line profile velocities in km s@xmath4 between the profile centroid velocity in the brightest spaxel ( v1 ) compared to the velocity in the second brightest spaxel ( v2 ) , using only sources in which both spaxels have s / n @xmath12 3 for the measured line flux ; line flux is shown in units of w m@xmath16 .",
    "the empirical uncertainty of final [ cii ] velocity measurements is taken as the one sigma dispersion among these velocity differences of @xmath9 50 km s@xmath4 , which includes uncertainties arising both from profile fitting and from location of the source within a spaxel .",
    "this plot does not include the 12 sources with asymmetric or component structure for which we only use the velocities from the brightest spaxel , because these are sources which may have real spatially different components . ]      in paper i , [ cii ] observations were compared with pah strength using irs low resolution spectra .",
    "all objects in that paper also have irs high resolution spectra , which derive from archival observations in various @xmath1 observing programs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for many sources , line fluxes have been previously published . for the present paper , we remeasure emission lines in these high resolution spectra with the goal of a uniformly measured data set that uses the final irs flux calibrations and noise masks ; the new measurements also provide an empirical determination of line flux uncertainties that arise from the profile fitting process and noise removal .",
    "line fluxes are measured using gaussian fits in the smart analysis program @xcite , beginning with the post - basic calibrated data products in the @xmath1 heritage archive .",
    "the line fit is on top of the underlying continuum which is a combination of background and real source continuum . because of the short irs high resolution slit",
    ", simultaneous background measurements can not be subtracted from a single on - source observation so we do not determine the real source continuum before fitting the line .",
    "therefore , equivalent widths are not measured .",
    "high resolution spectra are especially important for the [ neii ] 12.81 line fluxes because an adjacent pah feature makes accurate [ neii ] measures impossible on low resolution spectra .",
    "we treat the wings of the pah as an underlying continuum when measuring the [ neii ] flux .    even after removal",
    "of known bad pixels , the irs high resolution spectra are contaminated by noise spikes from individual  rogue pixels \" .",
    "these rarely interfere with individual emission lines at known wavelengths , although they are a serious contaminant when searching for weak , unknown emission features . in those few cases when a single pixel noise spike interferes with an otherwise smooth emission line profile ,",
    "such spikes are removed by visual inspection .",
    "this is done independently for each spectrum from the two nods of an observation , and line profiles are fit independently for each nod . to estimate the uncertainty of line fluxes arising from the noise removal and from the line fitting process ,",
    "line fluxes from the two spectra arising from the two nods were compared . as expected , line uncertainty is greater for fainter lines .",
    "the dispersion of the ratio of measured fluxes between the two nods is @xmath9 9% for all lines , and @xmath9 6% for bright lines with log flux @xmath12 -20.2 ( units of w cm@xmath16 ) . for quadratically combining irs line flux uncertainty with the [ cii ] uncertainty of @xmath9 20%",
    ", we adopt the larger 9% dispersion for all lines , giving a final uncertainty for flux ratios [ cii]/irs lines = @xmath9 22% .",

    "a related and important question is how sfr measured with [ cii ] compares with sfr measured using only the infrared continuum luminosity .",

    "a deficit could be explained by starbursts with increasing ionization parameter and harder ionizing radiation in more luminous sources @xcite or by having dustier , more obscured starbursts @xcite .",

    "this conclusion arose because luminous sources with an apparent deficit show the mid - infrared diagnostic of agn ( weak pah ) , indicating that most continuum luminosity is produced by agn dust heating .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 9 of paper 1 , where our sources reach @xmath10 @xmath21 10@xmath22 l@xmath3 , but all sources except one having @xmath10 @xmath12 10@xmath23 l@xmath3   contain agn .",

    "these comparisons indicate consistency between the two samples of starbursts .    to consider further the deficit issue , we can extend consideration of the [ cii ] line to continuum ratio to longer wavelengths ( representing emission from cooler dust ) than measured by @xmath20 .",
    "this can be done because the continuum at rest frame 158 is also measurable for most of our sources having [ cii ] line observations . attributing a deficit to luminous starbursts invokes the assumption that the coolest dust in luminous sources is invariably heated by starbursts instead of agn .",

    "the continuum flux densities are much weaker than the line and are often so weak in outlying spaxels that they are overwhelmed by noise . to minimize the effects of continuum noise , the continuum @xmath25(158 )",
    "is determined by using the total @xmath26([cii ) ] ) from table 2 combined with ew([cii ] ) measured only in the brightest spaxel .",
    "these ew are measured in all of our spectra and given in table 2 .",
    "the uncertainties are often large , primarily because the continua are faint and have large uncertainties after backgrounds are subtracted .",
    "the ew uncertainties that are given in table 2 include the combined uncertainty of the total line flux and of the continuum level in the brightest spaxel , but uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty in the continuum .",
    "the @xmath7(158 ) is compared to ew([cii ] ) in figure 8 for all of the [ cii ] detections in table 2 including agn , composites and starbursts ( the 10 non - detections are not used for this plot because their limits apply to both coordinates ) .",
    "coordinates are in log units to make direct comparisons with the line to continuum ratio plots @xmath2)$]/@xmath20 used to discuss the deficit in previous references .",
    "figure 8 shows similar ranges and dispersions of both values in all of the distributions for agn , composites , and starbursts .",
    "the cosmic variance among individual sources is greater than any systematic differences between classes ( shown more quantitatively in the discussion below of figure 9 ) .",
    "the overall conclusion from figure 8 is that the appearance of a ",
    "deficit \" is much less conspicuous when using @xmath7(158 ) than when using @xmath20 .",
    "for example , comparisons can be made with figure 1 of @xcite that compares @xmath2)$]/@xmath20 to @xmath20 for their combined sample of agn , composites , and starbursts .",
    "the luminosity range is comparable to that in figure 8 , @xmath21 10@xmath27 , but the range of line to continuum ratio is much greater in the comparison with @xmath20 ( @xmath6 100 ) , compared to a range of @xmath6 10 in figure 8 .",
    "another conspicuous difference is the clear trend for the upper envelope of points to show a deficit when @xmath5)$ ] is compared to @xmath20 , but this trend is not apparent in figure 8 .",
    "some high luminosity sources show ew as large as some low luminosity sources .",
    "these results indicate that the apparent deficit becomes less significant when continuum luminosity is measured at the longest wavelengths , consistent with the interpretation that the coolest dust arises in the same starbursts measured with the [ cii ] , pah , and neon features for starbursts of all luminosities .",
    "this conclusion can be further illustrated by comparing ew([cii ] ) with source classification based on ew(pah 6.2 ) ; if @xmath7(158 ) and l([cii ) ] ) both measure only the starburst component of any source , the ew([cii ] ) should be independent of source classification . the results are shown in figure 9 , showing all ew([cii ] ) in table 2 .",
    "the scatter increases for agn compared to starbursts primarily because of increased uncertainties caused by fainter continua . for starbursts , the typical observational uncertainty in ew(pah 6.2 )",
    "given in table 2 is only @xmath6 10% because the lines and continua are strong , but this uncertainty rises to @xmath6 50% for the weak lines and continua of the agn .     158 emission line in , with uncertainties , compared to ew(pah 6.2 ) classification , in .",
    "medians are shown as horizontal lines in each class .",
    "error bars show median one sigma uncertainties of the individual ew measurements for different classifications using uncertainties for each source given in table 2 .",
    "sources with upper limits in both ews are not plotted or included in medians , but sources with upper limits only in ew([cii ] ) are shown as small symbols ( all agn ) . ]",
    "the crucial result in figure 9 is that the median ew([cii ] ) is only marginally greater for starbursts compared to composites and agn ; within the uncertainty , a median value of ew([cii ] ) = 0.9 falls within all error bars . for starbursts , the median ew([cii ] ) = 1.0 , decreasing to ew([cii ] ) = 0.7@xmath90.4 for agn , and the difference is smaller than the dispersion in ew([cii ] ) among individual starbursts .",
    "the ew([cii ] ) changes much less than ew(pah 6.2 ) .",
    "the ew(pah ) ranges from @xmath8 0.01 to 0.6 , a range of more than 60 .",
    "this happens because an agn has greatly increased mid - infrared continuum from warm dust compared to a starburst , thereby decreasing ew(pah 6.2 ) .",
    "by contrast , the ew([cii ] ) ranges from @xmath6 0.2 to @xmath8 2 , a range of @xmath6 10 .",
    "this result indicates quantitatively that the far infrared continuum at 158 scales much more closely with the starburst component of any source than does the continuum at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this result illustrates why the @xmath7(158 ) could be a better estimate of sfr regardless of source classification than is @xmath20 , which includes shorter wavelength emission from hotter dust arising around agn .",
    "the preceding section shows that there is no conspicuous deficit when @xmath2)$ ] is compared to @xmath7(158 ) for the full sample of agn , composites and starbursts over all luminosities . any systematic change in @xmath2)$]/@xmath7(158 ) with luminosity or with classification",
    "is small compared to the the cosmic variance at a given luminosity .",
    "this result encourages the conclusion that the far infrared luminosity at 158 scales similarly with @xmath2)$ ] in sources of all classifications and luminosity .",
    "this would make @xmath7(158 ) a more reliable measure of sfr than the @xmath20 , if the latter sometimes includes an agn component of luminosity .",
    "it was concluded in section 3.2 that log sfr = log @xmath5)$ ] - 6.93 @xmath9 0.15 for sfr in m@xmath3 yr@xmath4   and @xmath5)$ ] in l@xmath3 , calibrated by comparison with the [ neii ] and [ neiii ] luminosities .",
    "the result derived independently in paper 1 by comparing [ cii ] luminosities with sfr derived from total infrared dust luminosity as in @xcite was log sfr = log @xmath2)$ ] - 7.08 @xmath9 0.3 .",
    "both results agree within the uncertainties , so we take as an overall calibration combining these results that log sfr = log @xmath2)$ ] - 7.0@xmath9 0.2 . in both cases ,",
    "the quoted uncertainties show only the cosmic variance among different starbursts but do not reflect any systematic uncertainties in the underlying calibrations .",
    "the agreement of the two independent methods implies , however , that such systematic calibration uncertainties are smaller than the variance among sources .",
    "results for the ew([cii ] ) in figure 9 allow a transformation from sfr as measured from @xmath2)$ ] to sfr measured from @xmath7(158 ) .",
    "this leads to a comparison with another independent calibration . using the median ew([cii ] ) of 1.0 for starbursts alone to mimimize any residual contamination by agn in the continuum , the relations among ew , @xmath2)$ ] , sfr , and @xmath7(158 ) yield log sfr = log @xmath7(158 ) - 42.8@xmath9 0.2 for sfr in m@xmath3 yr@xmath4   and @xmath7(158 ) in erg s@xmath4 ( to match units in figure 8) . for the luminosities of our sample shown in figure 8 , the resulting sfrs range over 0.8 @xmath8 log sfr @xmath8 2.7 .",
    "a previous effort with the same objective but a completely independent calibration was by @xcite , who used 160 photometry with @xmath1 for comparing continuum @xmath7(160 ) to the sfr calibrated by h@xmath28 luminosity .",
    "their sample consisted of 189 nearby star forming galaxies with generally low infrared luminosities which are not obscured lirgs or ulirgs so that sfrs could be calibrated using h@xmath28 luminosities without any corrections for extinction .",
    "they caution that lower luminosity systems may have significant 160 luminosity from dust heated by stellar populations not associated with the current star formation , but they conclude that the @xmath7(160 ) is dominated by ongoing star formation for @xmath7(160 ) @xmath12 2 x 10@xmath29 erg s@xmath4 ( which encompasses all of our sources ) . their resulting calibration is log sfr = log @xmath7(160 ) - 42.85 .",
    "this is nearly identical to our result even though derived with completely independent parameters .",
    "the agreement is somewhat fortuitous because calzetti et al .",
    "use different relations between ionizing photons and sfr compared to those of kennicutt ( 1998 ) which were used for our calibration of sfr using bolometric luminosities .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "note that with the kennicutt calibrations , their result would be log sfr = log @xmath7(160 ) - 42.68 .",
    "although this gives a sfr measure from the 160 continuum that is formally 1.3 times larger than our result , it is within our uncertainties .",
    "the combined results of the two samples cover a factor of 100 in sfrs and a wide range of dust obscuration , implying a generalized validity to use of the 160 continuum as a measure of sfr so long as there is confidence that the dust continuum is dominated by stellar heating .    a calibration of sfr from @xmath30(158 )",
    "was also determined by @xcite for a sample of 25 ulirgs ( dominated by agn ) for which they observe [ cii ] and continuum fluxes .",
    "their calibration of sfr arises from an earlier comparison @xcite between pah(6.2 + 11.3 ) luminosities and sfrs determined from [ neii ] and [ neiii ] luminosities using the results of @xcite . by comparing sfrs determined from these pah luminosities with the observed @xmath30(158 ) for the 25 ulirgs , they determine an empirical relation between sfr and continuum luminosity density that log sfr = 3.36@xmath90.22 + ( 1.42@xmath90.30)log @xmath30(158 ) , for luminosity density in l@xmath3   per hz .",
    "the non linear luminosity dependence implies that a greater sfr is measured from continuum luminosity compared to pah luminosity as luminosity increases , which is consistent with having a residual contamination of @xmath30(158 ) from agn luminosity for increasing luminosities . within the uncertainties of this fit and the luminosity dependence , our results for sfrs are similar .",
    "for example , at log @xmath7(158 ) = 45 in erg s@xmath4 , or log @xmath30(158 ) = -0.86 in l@xmath3  per hz , our calibration from pure starbursts yields log sfr = 2.2@xmath9 0.2 compared to the farrah et al .",
    "result of 1.7 @xmath8 log sfr @xmath8 2.6 .",
    "the uncertainty within our results that is introduced when using @xmath7(158 ) to measure sfr compared to using @xmath2)$ ] in sources of different classification can be estimated from the differences among ew([cii ] ) for different classifications in figure 9 . if some of the @xmath7(158 ) for agn and composites arises from dust heating by an agn , then ew([cii ] )",
    "should be less for these sources compared to starbursts . adopting the median ew([cii ] )",
    "= 1.0 as the measure of line to continuum ratio for pure starbursts leads to an estimate of the sfr error that would derive from use only of the continuum for agn or composite sources .",
    "the error in sfr measure is inversely proportional to the ew ; for example , an ew([cii ] ) = 0.5 would mean a continuum twice as strong as from starbursts , so the continuum alone would lead to an overestimate of sfr by a factor of two compared to the sfr measured from [ cii ] . for agn , the median ew([cii ] )",
    "= 0.7 , which implies a systematic overestimate of sfr by a factor of 1.4 if using only the far infrared continuum as the sfr indicator in agn . for agn",
    ", 21/56 have ew([cii ] ) @xmath8 0.5 , leading to an overestimate of sfr from the continuum alone by more than a factor of two in @xmath6 40% .",
    "although these results lead to smaller discrepancies in sfr than would be measured using only @xmath20 , confidence in measuring sfr within a factor of two from continuum luminosities alone requires confidence that the source is dominated by a starburst without continuum contamination by an agn .",
    "new [ cii ] 158 observations of 18 sources with the @xmath0 pacs instrument are presented , and a summary of our total sample of 130 [ cii ] sources is given that covers a wide range of agn to starburst classifications as derived from pah strength .",

    "results for 112 sources are compared with emission line fluxes from high resolution @xmath1 irs spectra .",
    "a new calibration of [ cii ] as a sfr indicator is determined by comparing [ cii ] fluxes with mid - infrared [ neii ] and [ neiii ] emission line fluxes .",
