    "in this paper we describe a new method for finding and classifying fixed equilibrium distributions of point singularities of source / sink , point vortex , or spiral source / sink type in the complex plane under the dynamical assumption that each point ` goes with the flow ' .",
    "this includes configurations placed at random points in the plane , at prescribed points , or lying along prescribed curves .",
    "this last situation is reminiscent of a classical technique for enforcing boundary conditions along arbitrarily shaped boundaries embedded in fluid flows .",
    "these techniques are generically referred to as singularity distribution methods .",
    "see , for example , katz and plotkin ( 2001 ) and cortez ( 1996 , 2000 ) for applications and discussions of these methods in the context of potential flow , hence inviscid boundary conditions , and cortez ( 2001 ) in the context of stokes flow , hence viscous boundary conditions .",
    "for these problems , there is generally no associated evolution equation for the interacting singularities which discretize the boundary , as in ( [ eqn1a ] ) for us .",
    "their positions are fixed to lie along the given boundary , and the strengths are then judiciously chosen to enforce the relevant inviscid or viscous boundary conditions . as in cortez ( 2001 ) , it would be of interest to ` regularize ' the point singularities ( 1.1 ) and ask if the methods in this paper can be extended to smoothed out singularities , as would a more complete analysis of the ` pseudo - spectrum ' associated with the configuration matrices @xmath7 , as discussed trefethen and bau ( 1997 ) ."
