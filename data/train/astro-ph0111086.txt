    "high - mass stars , although rare , are a major contributor of energy to the ambient ism , be it during their birth in the form of jets and outflows , during their uv - radiating lifetime , or during their spectacular death as supernovae .",
    "they are commonly detected in rich clusters of stars and to date an example of isolated high - mass star formation has not been observed .",
    "thus , if one wants to understand the process of high - mass star formation , one must understand the physical processes which lead to the formation of entire clusters of stars .",
    "furthermore , the dense clusters may influence the formation of massive stars , and may even be a required precursor for high - mass star formation . is the formation of high - mass stars a natural implication of the stellar density and the possible interaction and coalescence of low - mass stars in large clusters ?",
    "do low - mass stars therefore need to form before a high - mass star can be fused ? or is it that high - mass stars simply form independently in the same dense environment as low - mass stars through the same processes of mass accretion ?    in this contribution , we present observations which show the presence of _ massive reservoirs of seemingly quiescent dense gas _ in close proximity to highly active cluster - forming cores .",
    "we argue that these reservoirs are at an early stage of star formation , where the usual signposts of massive stars and cluster formation  strong mid - ir emission , bright radio continuum sources , and dense clusters of stars in 2  @xmath5 m imaging  are absent .",
    "instead , the only signatures of star formation comes from deeply embedded high - mass stars , namely masers , powerful outflows , and luminous submm sources .",
    "we propose that _ some of the youngest regions of cluster formation may be found by using these early signposts of high - mass star formation _ , and describe an ongoing search for such regions .",
    "from observations of 100 open clusters , battinelli & capuzzo - dolcetta ( 1991 ) concluded that the star formation rate in clusters in our galaxy is 225  m@xmath1myr@xmath6 kpc@xmath7 , whereas the sfr near the sun is 30005000  m@xmath1myr@xmath6kpc@xmath7 . from observations of perseus , l1641 , 50% of l1630 , and mon r2 as part of the two micron all sky survey , carpenter ( 2000 ) deduces that the largest fraction of stars must form in clusters .",
    "in fact , 70% of the young stars identified in carpenter s analysis are in clusters with more than 100 members .",
    "this then leads one to the conclusion that the 10% still seen as open clusters are simply those that remain bound long after their parental molecular clouds are dissipated .",
    "the dispersal of the molecular gas in clusters is very much a function of their most massive members .",
    "high - mass stars ( @xmath8 m@xmath1 , corresponding to spectral type b6 or earlier ) are always found to be associated with rich clusters with stellar densities of more than 1000 stars per pc@xmath9 .",
    "these clusters are thus affected by the dispersive jets , the intense uv fields and , if the cluster remains bound after the dispersal of the molecular cloud , the ensuing supernovae of the massive stars .    from observation of herbig ae",
    "/ be stars , testi , palla , & natta ( 1999 ) conclude that the lack of clusters around stars later than b7b8 is an imprint of the stellar formation mode for high - mass stars .",
    "the process of high - mass star formation within dense clusters through spherical accretion has been a long - standing problem . at around",
    "810  m@xmath1 the radiation pressure of the forming star begins to inhibit further infall of the material accreting ( e.g.  yorke & kruegel 1977 , kahn 1974 , larson & starrfield 1971 ) .",
    "models including rotating protostellar grainy disks ( e.g.  jijina & adams 1996 , wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) , magnetic fields ( balsara et  al .",
    "2001 , nakano 1998 ) , and accretion rates growing with time ( behrend & maeder 2001 ) can certainly push this limit very much higher , but the theories about the physical backgrounds for the accretion process are still open for much discussion . at stellar densities of around 10@xmath10pc@xmath11 accretion",
    "induced collision may begin to have a significant effect on the formation of high - mass stars up to the point where fusion of lower mass stars may actually form the more massive members ( e.g.  bonnell et  al .",
    "1998 , stahler et  al .  1998 ) .",
    "these two scenarios for forming massive stars in clusters  accretion and star coalescence ",
    "are the focus of the current debate .",
    "high - mass stars are typically formed in warm ( @xmath12  k ) , dense ( n(h@xmath4 ) @xmath13 cm@xmath11 ) , compact ( @xmath15  au ) and massive ( @xmath2  m@xmath1 ) dust cores , easily traced in cs , ch@xmath3cn , hc@xmath3n , or nh@xmath3 and the submm - continuum with typical fir luminosities of @xmath16  l@xmath1 .",
    "these cores are usually associated with h@xmath4o , ch@xmath3oh , h@xmath4co , nh@xmath3 , and/or",
    "oh masers and often , at a later stage when the most massive members are emerging from their natal cocoons , hyper- or ultracompact h  ii regions . often one can find shock - excited h@xmath4 emission knots at 2.1  @xmath5 m and/or high - velocity bipolar outflows from broad wings in sio or @xmath17co molecular emission lines .",
    "these molecular outflows typically have masses of around 150 ( 105000 )  m@xmath1 and outflow rates of @xmath18  m@xmath1yr@xmath6 ( garay & lizano 1999 ) .",
    "outflows and certain types of masers appear very early on in the formation process , long before luminous ir sources or h  ii regions can be detected .",
    "sheperd & churchwell ( 1996 ) have shown that the outflow properties seem to be correlated with the luminosity of the embedded sources driving the outflows .",
    "although new observation by henning et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are in support of this , a recent analysis of a number of massive outflows seems to indicate that this empirical relationship breaks down with increasingly higher mass ( cf .",

    "w3 main is a well - studied and very active region of high - mass star formation in the w3 gmc at a distance of 2.3 kpc .",
    "the w3 main region is 10 pc north of the w3(oh ) region and consists of two main molecular cores : w3  east & west . towards w3",
    "east we find a dense stellar cluster associated with the luminous infrared source irs  5 embedded in the compact molecular core w3  sms1 ( tieftrunk et  al .",
    "1998 ) . towards this region megeath et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected the highest density of stars : a cluster of @xmath19 low - mass stars , corresponding to a stellar density of a few @xmath20 pc@xmath11 .",
    "the bright source irs  5 itself is associated with a massive bipolar outflow ( hasegawa et  al .",
    "1994 ) and a cluster of h@xmath4o masers where claussen et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) have detected a number of hypercompact h  ii regions with diameters less than 1000 au . towards irs  4 , embedded in the compact molecular core w3  sms2 , tieftrunk et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) found another similar hypercompact h  ii region .",
    "the presence of hypercompact sources indicates that the massive stars are just beginning to ionize their surrounding cores ( tieftrunk et  al .",
    "1997 ) . just to the south of irs  4 , is the molecular core w3  west / sms3 ( ladd et  al .",
    "this dense core is seemingly quiescent : it is devoid of mid - ir sources and radio continuum sources , and 2  @xmath5 m imaging has failed to detect a cluster in sms3 ( tieftrunk et al .",
    "1998 ) . since sms3 has a molecular mass and density higher than the surrounding cluster - forming cores , tieftrunk , gaume & wilson ( 1998 ) argued that the sms3 core may be at an early stage of cluster formation .      towards the north - eastern edge of the giant molecular cloud ngc 6334 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , at a distance of 1.7 kpc ( neckel 1978 ) , another massive twin core system can be found : ngc 6334 i and i(n ) ( fig .",
    "3 ) . as w3  sms1 & 3 , these two cores present a unique duet for studying the evolution of stellar clusters and the interstellar chemistry in young star - forming cores .",
    "ngc 6334 i , with a total mass of @xmath2  m@xmath1 and a dust temperature of @xmath21 k , is a dense and compact molecular hot core associated with an ultracompact cometary h  ii as well as a strong ir continuum region and a group of ch@xmath3oh , h@xmath4o , oh , and nh@xmath3 masers .",
    "it is considered to be the youngest of the star - forming regions in the ngc 6334 gmc , exhibiting the richest chemistry of all sources .",
    "in fact , our sest data shows that this source is comparable to orion - kl and sgr b2 in the richness of its spectrum",
    ". however , in comparison to these sources where the preponderance of line blending is a principal problem for assigning emission lines or detecting new transitions , line widths in ngc 6334  i are 24 times more narrow allowing for a significantly higher detection rate of weaker features ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "in fact , we detected a plethora of line features down to a noise level of 0.01 k and expect that _",
    "sgr b2 and orion - kl will be replaced by ngc 6334 i as the new standard source in searches for new interstellar molecules and transitions _",
    "( tieftrunk & thorwirth , in prep . ) .    only 1.5@xmath22 north ( 1  pc at 1.7  kpc ) of ngc 6334 i a second core of roughly equal size , comparable mass , and a molecular hydrogen density of @xmath23 cm@xmath11 ( kuiper et al .",
    "1995 ) is apparent ( sandell 2000 ) . designated ngc 6334 i/(north ) [ hereafter i(n ) ]",
    "it is notable for the lack of mid - ir emission : to date , no thermal infrared emission has been detected from this region at wavelengths @xmath24 m ( gezari 1982 ) .",
    "it does not contain an h  ii region .",
    "however , h@xmath4o and ch@xmath3oh ( class i and ii ) masers have been detected in the core .",
    "very recently , megeath & tieftrunk ( 1999 ) presented evidence from sest and eso-2.2 m data for multiple outflows originating in i(n ) ( fig .",
    "5 ) . using the sio and @xmath17co emission in the line wings towards i(n ) , we deduced an outflow mass of 7  m@xmath1 , transporting @xmath25  m@xmath1 yr@xmath6 . from the well - known relationship of shepherd & churchwell ( 1996 ) we thus estimated a luminosity of @xmath20  l@xmath1 and a mass of 10  m@xmath1 for the driving source",
    "thus , the i(n ) core already contains at least one high - mass ( proto)star and is possibly on the verge of cluster formation ( cf . also sandell 2000 ) . from these observations",
    "we conclude that the _ first detectable evidence for cluster formation are the signposts of outflows and masers of the associated high - mass stars _",
    "long before a dense 2  @xmath5 m cluster itself appears .",
    "thus the formation of intermediate to high - mass stars can at least precede the _ appearance _ of the associated cluster of low - mass stars .",
    "this , however , does not imply that low - mass stars would actually form later as well ; they may be too deeply embedded to become visible to the observer at an early stage of the cluster formation .",
    "surveys of the earliest stages of massive star formation have concentrated on uc h  ii regions ( e.g.  brand et  al .  1984 ,",
    "wood & churchwell 1989 ) , some associated with iras sources ( e.g.  bronfman et  al .",
    "1996 , osterloh et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and more recently , on luminous iras sources which are not associated with h  ii regions ( e.g.  zhang et  al .",
    "2001 , molinari et  al .",
    "2000 , sridharan et  al.1999 ) . however , as demonstrated by ngc 6334 i(n ) and w3  sms3 , the earliest phases of massive star formation are probably both radio and infrared - quiet  analogous to the class 0 phase of low - mass star formation  and searches using the iras database may miss some of the youngest , most interesting sources . due to the lack of unbiased submillimeter surveys of the galaxy , only a few",
    "truly deeply embedded massive protostars or class 0 objects are known .    from the atca survey by walsh et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) we had selected 46 maser clusters that were radio- and ir - quiet , i.e. not associated with uc h   ii regions and more than 1 pc ( 114 ) away from the nearest iras point source . with the sest we detected broad sio emission line wings towards 15 of these , indicative of outflows .",
    "it is clear that these ch@xmath3oh maser clusters with sio outflows must have a driving source .",
    "these sources , however , are inconspicuous in the mid - ir and thus must be deeply embedded .",
    "ngc 6334 i(n ) , which has a comparable flux density to ngc 6334 i at 400  @xmath5 m , is much brighter at 1 mm ( gezari 1982 ) .",
    "thus , these deeply embedded objects appear to be the prominent sources when observed at 1  mm in a system of star - forming cores . with simba , the 37-multichannel bolometer of sest , we will now observe the 1200  @xmath5 m flux of the maser sources .",
    "since dust emission at ( sub)mm wavelengths is generally optically thin , it provides a much better contrast between high and low density gas than most molecular lines . from this sample of regions ,",
    "we expect to find not only the youngest examples of high - mass star formation , but some of the youngest regions of cluster formation .",
    "with such a sample we can better study the relationship between high- and low - mass stars , as well as construct a better picture of the physical and chemical environment of molecular clouds at the onset of cluster formation .",
