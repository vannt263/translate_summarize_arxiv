    "the study of conformations of slender elastic rods is of substantial utility in several applications , ranging from the fields of structural mechanics and engineering to biochemistry and biology .",
    "examples are the study of coiling and loop formation of sub - oceanic cables @xcite , filamentary structures of biomolecules @xcite and bacterial fibers @xcite , the phenomenon of helix hand reversal in climbing plants @xcite and the shape and dynamics of cracking whips @xcite .",
    "the kirchhoff model @xcite provides a powerful approach to study the statics and dynamics of elastic thin rods @xcite . in this model",
    "the rod is described by a set of nine partial differential equations ( the _ kirchhoff equations _ ) in the time and arclength of the rod .",
    "they contain the forces and torques plus a triad of vectors describing the deformations of the rod .",
    "these equations are the result of newton s second law for the linear and angular momentum applied to the thin rod plus a linear constitutive relationship between moments and strains .",
    "the kirchhoff model holds true in the approximation of small curvatures of the rod , as compared to the radius of the local cross section @xcite .",
    "an interesting characteristic of this model , known as _ kirchhoff kinetic analogy _",
    ", is that the equations governing the static problem are formally equivalent to the euler equations describing the motion of spinning tops in a gravity field .",
    "the kirchhoff equations for equilibrium configurations can , therefore , be written in hamiltonian form .",
    "the kirchhoff equations have been solved for a number of simple situations .",
    "shi and hearst@xcite first obtained analytical solutions of the equilibrium equations and , recently , nizzete and goriely @xcite completed the study by making a classification of all kinds of equilibrium solutions .",
    "goriely and tabor @xcite developed a method to study the dynamical stability of these solutions and fonseca and de aguiar @xcite applied this method to study the near equilibrium dynamics of non - homogeneous closed rods in viscous media .",
    "recently , tobias _",
    "@xcite developed the necessary and sufficient criteria for elastic stability of equilibrium configurations of closed rods .",
    "in many cases of interest , including biological molecules , the filaments are subject to boundary conditions .",
    "examples are the problem of multiprotein structures , such as histones and gyrase , about which long pieces of dna wrap @xcite , and multiprotein structures , such as the _ lac repressor _ complex @xcite . despite the many achievements",
    "described above , the study of the boundary value problem ( bvp ) associated with kirchhoff filaments is still a big challenge . while the integration of differential equations from initial conditions is a relatively simple numerical task , the difficulties of finding solutions for given boundary conditions",
    "are well known in classical mechanics , electromagnetism and quantum mechanics .",
    "typical examples are classical trajectories connecting two given space points in the time @xmath0 , electric potentials that vanish at given surfaces and eigenvalues of the laplace operator defined inside a finite domain ( quantum billiards ) .    because of the analogy with spinning tops",
    ", the case of trajectories of hamiltonian systems is of particular interest here . the _ monodromy method _ , developed by baranger and davis @xcite ,",
    "was designed specifically to find periodic solutions of hamiltonian systems with @xmath1 degrees of freedom .",
    "xavier and de aguiar @xcite extended the method to find non - periodic trajectories with any given combination of @xmath2 position and momenta at initial and/or final times .",
    "a widely used method to solve bvps is the so called _ shooting method _ @xcite . for a single second - order differential equation ,",
    "the method consists in finding the proper velocity at the initial point so as to reach the desired target at the end point , similar to the shooting of a projectile .",
    "examples of applications of this method to the kirchhoff equations are the search for homoclinic orbits in reversible systems @xcite , heteroclinic orbits resembling tendril pervesions @xcite and the study of localized buckling modes of thin elastic filaments @xcite .    in the case of open rods",
    "some specific bvps were solved recently .",
    "krolyi and domokos @xcite , using symbolic dynamics , found global invariants for bvps of elastic linkages , as natural discretization of continuous elastic beams , an old problem solved by euler(see reference @xcite ) . gottlieb and perkins @xcite investigated spatially complex forms in a bvp governing the equilibrium of slender cables subjected to thrust , torsion and gravity . also , the criteria of tobias _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was applied to linear segments subjected to _ strong anchoring end conditions _",
    ", where not only the end points but also the tangent vector at the end points are held fixed .",
    "the dependence of dna tertiary structure on end conditions was studied in @xcite , where explicit expressions for equilibrium configurations were obtained for a specific case with symmetric end conditions .",
    "our aim in this paper is to develop a method to find equilibrium solutions of finite rods subjected to boundary conditions at their end points and with given load parameters .",
    "we emphasize that this is different from the approach in @xcite , where the authors use shooting methods to calculate localized buckling modes .",
    "these modes are treated as homoclinic solutions of the kirchhoff equations , corresponding to infinite rods that become asymptotically straight in the infinite .",
    "our objective is to find equilibrium solutions for _ finite _ rods subjected to boundary conditions at both ends .",
    "our method is an adaptation of the monodromy matrix method for non - periodic trajectories @xcite to the hamiltonian formulation of the static kirchhoff equations .",
    "we work with the kirchhoff equations directly in euler angles , instead of using the cartesian position and tangent vectors @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in working with euler angles is that the variables that one wants to hold fixed , the spatial position of the filament end points , are not the variables appearing in the differential equations describing the rod .",
    "however , the number of differential equations to be solved is much smaller in these variables . using a symmetry of the hamiltonian",
    ", we end up with only two independent equations to solve .",
    "one of the motivations of this work is its possible biological applications as , for example , the study of single dna molecules manipulated by optical traps @xcite , and the dna loops between multiprotein structures ( such as the _ lac _ repressor - operator complex ) @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii , their hamiltonian formulation . in sec .",
    "iv we describe our method for solving the bvp .",

    "v we give numerical examples , calculating the three dimensional configuration of rods with different sets of load parameters and end positions .",
    "we also discuss the existence of solutions as function of the load parameters . in sec .",
    "vi , motivated by the repeated sequences of base - pairs commonly found in dna molecules , we consider rods with periodically varying young modulus .",
    "we compare the configurations of these non - homogeneous rods against their homogeneous counterparts , fixing the same end points and mechanical parameters . in sec .",
    "vii we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the kirchhoff model describes the dynamics of inextensible thin elastic filaments within the approximation of linear elasticity theory @xcite .",
    "they result from the application of newton s laws of mechanics to a thin rod , and consist of two equations describing the balance of linear and angular momentum plus a constitutive relationship of linear elasticity theory , relating moments to strains .",
    "the kirchhoff model assumes that the filament is thin and weakly bent ( _ i.e. _ its cross - section radius is much smaller than its length and its curvature at all points ) . in this approximation",
    "it is possible to derive a one - dimensional theory where forces and moments are averaged over the cross - sections perpendicular to the central axis of the filament .",
    "a thin tube can be described by a smooth curve @xmath3 in the 3d space parametrized by the arclength @xmath4 , and whose position depends on the time : @xmath5 .",
    "a _ local orthonormal basis _ , ( or _ director basis _ ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is defined at each point of the curve , with @xmath8 chosen as the tangent vector , @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we shall use primes to denote differentiation with respect to @xmath4 and dots to denote differentiation with respect to time .",
    "the two orthonormal vectors , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , lie in the plane normal to @xmath8 , for example along the principal axes of the cross section of the rod .",
    "these vectors are chosen such that @xmath12 form a right - handed orthonormal basis for all values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the space and time evolution of the director basis along the curve are controlled by _ twist _ and _ spin equations _",

    "the components of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the director basis are defined as @xmath17 and @xmath18 . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the components of the curvature and @xmath21 is the twist density of the rod .",
    "the solution of the twist and spin equations determines @xmath22 , which can be integrated to give the space curve @xmath23 .",

    "we need a _ constitutive relation _ relating the local forces and moments ( stresses ) to the elastic deformations of the body ( strains ) . in the linear theory of elasticity , and for a homogeneous elastic material ,",
    "the stress is proportional to the deformation .",
    "the young s modulus @xmath47 and the shear modulus @xmath48 characterize the elastic properties of the material .",
    "therefore , it is possible to obtain , for small deformations , a constitutive relation for the moment .",
    "for a isotropic material , in the director basis , this relation is @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the principal moment of inertia of the cross section , @xmath51 are the components of the strain vector and @xmath52 are the components of the twist vector in the unstressed configuration .",

    "we see immediately that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants and that @xmath90 is the only independent variable .    the total elastic energy of the rod can be calculated by the integration of the eq .",

    "in this section we present our method for finding the configuration of finite rods subject to boundary conditions in the position of its initial and final points .",
    "in fact , since the kirchhoff equations are invariant under space translations , we can always choose the initial point be the origin . as we saw in the previous section , equilibrium solutions for the static kirchhoff equations",
    "depend only on two initial conditions , namely , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the third initial condition , @xmath114 corresponds to a rotation of this solution around the z - axis .",
    "the problem is then that of finding a solution that starts from the origin and ends at @xmath115 and at a distance @xmath116 from the z - axis .",
    "our method is based on a series of small deformations made upon an initial solution of the kirchhoff equations which , however , does not have the desired boundary values for @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we call this initial solution the _ trial solution_. the method consists in pushing the end point of the trial solution to the desired position , step by step . the basic idea , which is a type of shooting procedure , is to find a variation in the initial conditions so as to obtain the desired variation in the end point .    in order to do so , we shall employ a variation of the monodromy method @xcite , originally devised to calculate periodic solutions of chaotic hamiltonian systems . as discussed in the introduction , working with the kirchhoff equations in euler angles poses an extra difficulty on the already hard problem of satisfying boundary conditions : the variables to be held fixed , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , are not the ones entering the equations of motion , namely , @xmath90 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",

    ". the number of steps required will depend on the particular configuration and possibly on the stability of the rod . in all integrations presented in this paper ,",
