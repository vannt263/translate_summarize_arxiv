    "this paper is devoted to the study of the microlocal solutions near @xmath7 to the equation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a self - adjoint @xmath0-pseudodifferential operator whose principal symbol can be reduced to @xmath10 for some real and positive @xmath11 s .",
    "the energies @xmath2 are supposed to lie at distance @xmath3 of the critical value @xmath12 .",
    "of course such a situation occurs for a schrdinger operator @xmath13 when the potential @xmath14 has a non - degenerate local maximum , and the results of this paper might have many applications to quantum theory , allowing precise study of spectral or scattering quantities attached to these schrdinger operators .    in this setting , the hamiltonian vector field associated to @xmath15",
    "has an hyperbolic fixed point at @xmath7 , and the stable / unstable manifold theorem ensures the existence of a stable incoming manifold @xmath16 , and of a stable outgoing manifold @xmath17 in @xmath18 .",
    "the manifold @xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) can be described as the union of bicharacteristics @xmath21 such that @xmath22 as @xmath23 ( resp . as @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is therefore a very natural question to ask , if the knowledge of a microlocal solution of the equation @xmath25 in @xmath16 determines the solution on @xmath17 , thus in a whole neighborhood of the fixed point .    in the analytic , one - dimensional case",
    ", this problem has been given a complete answer by b. helffer and j. sjstrand in their study of harper s operator @xcite .",
    "their reduction to a normal form result ( on the operator side ) , has then been used in several works , as for the study of gaps width for hill s equation by c. mrz @xcite and the third author @xcite , or the computation of the scattering matrix at barrier tops @xcite .",
    "there is also a series of work by y. colin de verdire and b. parisse @xcite about the so - called double - well problem where the same ideas are developed in a @xmath6 setting .",
    "here we address that question in the @xmath26-dimensional case , @xmath27 .",
    "we want to stress out the fact that the results by n. hanges , v. ivrii or r. melrose , concerning propagation of singularities for operators with multiple characteristics ( see e.g. @xcite ) , do not apply here , since we are not in the case where the symbol factorizes as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 of principal type . also , we do nt think that a birkhoff normal form reduction on the classical level can be used to obtain the results we give in this paper . in any case , such a reduction would require a non - resonant assumption on the @xmath30 s , that we do nt need here .",
    "first , we prove some kind of propagation of singularity result , both in the analytic and in the @xmath6 category .",
    "in these two categories , we show in theorem [ un1 ] and theorem [ un2 ] below that , roughly speaking , the null solution is the only microlocal solution of the equation @xmath8 defined in a neighborhood of @xmath7 , which vanishes on the stable incoming manifold @xmath16 .",
    "this holds for energies @xmath2 in any neighborhood of the critical energy @xmath31 of size @xmath3 , that do not belong to some discrete subset @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 , then purely outgoing solutions exist - that is solutions which vanish out of @xmath17 .    in the analytic case ,",
    "our discussion is strongly related to the study of the resonances generated by a critical point of the principal symbol of a schrdinger operator , and we use the same strategy as j.  sjstrand in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) : our proof relies on energy estimates rather than on a reduction to a normal form .    in the @xmath6 case ,",
    "our proof rely also on energy estimates , but these are obtained using quite different ideas from recent works by n. burq and m. zworski , s.h .",
    "tang and m. zworski ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , together with @xmath0-pseudodifferential calculus in some suitable class of symbols",
    ".    then we turn to existence results in the @xmath6 case : for energies @xmath2 away from the discrete set @xmath32 , we show the existence and give a representation formula for the solution of @xmath8 with given cauchy data on @xmath16 .",
    "our proof relies heavily on ideas from b. helffer and j. sjstrand in @xcite , devoted to the study of the tunnel effect between non - resonant potential wells .",
    "thanks to this representation formula , we build a microlocal transition operator , which associates the microlocal value of this solution on @xmath17 to the data on @xmath16 .",
    "we describe completely this operator ( see theorem [ explicit ] and theorem [ cho ] ) , which turns out to be a @xmath0-fourier integral operator associated to the canonical relation @xmath34 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secamr ] , we describe precisely our geometrical settings , give our assumptions , and state our results .",
    "section [ unan ] and section [ uncinf ] are devoted to the proof of theorem [ un1 ] and of theorem [ un2 ] , concerning the propagation of singularities at the hyperbolic fixed point , respectively in the analytic category , and in the @xmath6 category .",
    "then , in section [ secexis ] , we address the question of existence of microlocal solutions of the natural cauchy problem associated to our geometric setting , and we prove theorem [ exis ] . in section 6 we obtain a precise formula for that solution which is given in theorem [ explicit ] and [ cho ] .",
    "eventually , we have recalled in a short appendix the results from @xmath0-pseudodifferential calculus that we use in section 4 .",
    "@xmath35    since our results are of microlocal nature , and since we shall constantly use this vocabulary through the paper , we briefly recall from @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) the precise meaning of expressions like `` @xmath36 microlocally in @xmath37 '' . for @xmath38 ,",
