    "hadronic decays of the @xmath4 are a clean scenario were to learn features about the hadronization of qcd currents in its non - perturbative regime @xcite and the decays involving the @xmath5 meson are particularly interesting because of the selection rules that apply @xcite in the isospin limit . within this approximation",
    ", it is seen that the @xmath5 and the vector current , @xmath6 , have opposed g - parity than the @xmath7 and the axial - vector current , @xmath8 .",
    "then , the decay @xmath9 can only be produced in the sm as an isospin violating effect , since it has opposite g - parity to the participating vector current .",
    "the processes that we study here , @xmath10 , can be considered as due only to @xmath6 to a very good approximation .",
    "+ the decay amplitude for these decays may be written as : @xmath11 where we will consider the hadron tensor given by the @xmath6 contribution only : @xmath12 with @xmath13",
    "since qcd is non - perturbative for @xmath14 , it is not possible to go further in a model independent way .",
    "however , it would be desirable to keep as many qcd properties as possible .",
    "@xmath15 is large enough to prevent the application of @xmath16 @xcite for all the spectra @xcite , however in the low - energy limit one should recover its results .",
    "the expansion parameter in @xmath16 ceases to be valid at @xmath17 and the inverse of the number of colours in qcd is a useful alternative to build the expansion upon @xcite and helps formulate a lagrangian theory , @xmath18 , where the resonances that mediate hadronic @xmath4 decays become active degrees of freedom @xcite and the known short - distance qcd behaviour @xcite has been demanded to the green functions @xcite and associated form factors . + for any phenomenological study it will be essential to provide the resonances with a proper energy - dependence width , that we obtain within @xmath18@xcite .",
    "this program has been applied successfully to explain the phenomenology of many two- and three - meson @xmath4 decay channels  @xcite .",
    "+ in the case at hand , @xmath19 , only the vector current contributes in the isospin limit .",
    "our formalism includes the wess - zumino term @xcite as in @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , one considers the one - resonance mediated diagrams with an odd - parity term : the couplings of a vector and a pseudoscalar to the vector source @xcite ( @xmath20 couplings ) and those in which a vector resonance couples to three mesons @xcite ( @xmath21 couplings ) .",
    "two - resonance mediated diagrams are also accounted for in this negative parity sector @xcite ( the coefficients of the @xmath22 operators are called @xmath23 ) .",
    "13 of the 18 lagrangian couplings appear in the process under study .",
    "+ demanding the known ultraviolet behaviour of the imaginary part of the vector - vector correlator @xcite one obtains relations among the couplings that allow the theory to keep some predictive power . in this case",
    ", only 4 couplings remain unknown after this step .",
    "we read the value of the free combination of @xmath21 couplings from ref .",
    "@xcite and rely on the value obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite of a @xmath23 whose coefficient vanishes in the chiral limit ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , only 2 coefficients are still free .",
    "we reproduce @xcite the pdg branching ratio @xcite , @xmath25 , for natural values of both couplings ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) as it is displayed in fig .",
    "+     ]    in addition to this , we have fit these two couplings to belle data @xcite on the number of events per bin versus the invariant mass of the hadron system as it is represented in fig [ fig2 ] .",
    "we have checked that the best fit is obtained with the value of @xmath27 assumed in sect .",
    "[ theory ] .",
    "moreover , we have also verified that the inclusion of a @xmath28 does not improve sensibly the fit and does not produce the bump structure that is observed near the endpoint .",
    "+   +    finally , using isospin symmetry , it is possible to relate the low - energy @xmath29 to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "then , our analysis for @xmath19 decays allows to predict the low - energy limit of this cross - section , as displayed in fig .",
    "annihilation into hadrons to predict the corresponding semileptonic tau decays @xcite . ] +   +",
    "we have studied the decay @xmath19 within the framework of resonance chiral theory guided by the large-@xmath31 expansion of @xmath2 , the low - energy limit given by @xmath16 and the appropriate asymptotic behaviour of the vector form factor that helps to fix most of the initially unknown couplings . indeed only two remain free after completing this procedure and having used information acquired in the previous related analyses .",
    "we reproduce the pdg branching ratio for this mode and study its spectral function assisted by belle data .",
    "+ these are flourishing days for this branch of physics , where the data samples collected at cleo , babar and belle through the years have allowed very precise studies and current and forthcoming experimental results from them , bes - iii , vepp and hopefully super - b and super-@xmath4-charm factories will demand a dedicated effort both on the theory description and on the monte carlo event generation algorithms @xcite .",
    "these hadron matrix elements will be implemented @xcite in the monte carlo generator for @xmath4 decays tauola @xcite .",
    "using isospin symmetry , we provide a prediction for the low - energy behaviour of @xmath29 that may be of interest for the hadronic matrix element in the phokhara @xcite monte carlo generator .",
