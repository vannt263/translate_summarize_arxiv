    "in cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) , a white dwarf primary star accretes matter by way of roche lobe overflow from a binary companion , which resembles a main - sequence star .",
    "the variety of cv behaviors leads to a complicated taxonomy @xcite .",
    "many cvs undergo dwarf nova outbursts , thought to be caused by accretion disk instabilities which greatly increase the rate at which matter moves inward in the disk .",
    "other cvs , called novalike variables , remain in a bright state for years at a time . in still others , called am her stars or polars , the matter that is transferred becomes entrained in a strong white - dwarf magnetic field , and is funneled directly onto the white dwarf s magnetic pole .",
    "the main driver of cv evolution is thought to be a gradual loss of orbital angular momentum .",
    "this causes the roche critical lobe of the secondary star to shrink , leading to a shortening of the orbital period @xmath0 , and driving mass transfer on long ( gyr ) timescales .",
    "the mechanisms by which angular momentum is lost are not fully understood .",
    "it is often supposed that magnetic braking of the secondary star predominates at longer periods ( @xmath1 3 hr ) , and that magnetic braking becomes inefficient at short period , so that gravitational radiation predominates .",
    "around @xmath0 = 70 min , the secondary becomes degenerate and its radius begins to _ increase _ with mass , leading to a slow _ increase _ in the orbital radius .",
    "this turnaround is often called the _ period bounce _ , even though it is thought to take place very slowly .",
    "the histogram of cv orbital periods shows a significant dip at roughly 2 hr @xmath2 3 hr , known as the _ gap _ @xcite .",
    "this is often explained as follows . as the secondary loses mass , its thermal timescale increases to become comparable to the time for the orbit to evolve , with the result that the secondary exceeds its equilibrium radius . at about three hours ,",
    "the secondary becomes fully convective , reducing the efficiency of magnetic braking .",
    "as the orbital evolution slows , the secondary detaches from its roche lobe , shutting down mass transfer .",
    "the detached system continues to evolve to shorter periods , crossing the gap and eventually re - establishing contact with the roche lobe near @xmath3 hr .",
    "while the mechanism by which this happens is somewhat speculative , @xcite shows that a discontinuity in the secondary stars radii occurs across the gap .    in a steady state , the number of stars with a given @xmath0 should be inversely proportional ( roughly ) to @xmath4 , the rate at which the period changes . if @xmath4 really is very slow at short periods , then there should be a large population of short - period cvs , and the gradual turnaround at the period bounce around 70 minutes should lead to a ` spike ' in the distribution @xcite .",
    "efforts to confront theories such as this with observation have often been frustrated , because the sample of known cvs is incomplete in ways that are difficult to quantify .",
    "the discovery channels for cvs include the following : ( 1 ) dwarf nova outbursts are conspicuous ",
    "they last for days or weeks and typically have amplitudes of several magnitudes . ( 2 )",
    "nearly all cvs have unusual colors compared to normal stars , most conspicuously ultraviolet excesses arising from accretion processes or ( in some cases ) the underlying white dwarf .",
    "( 3 ) with the exception of some novalike variables and dwarf novae near the peak of outburst , nearly all cvs show emission lines , especially in the balmer sequence ; these can be strong enough to be noticed in surveys such as iphas @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) a great many other cvs have been discovered as optical counterparts of x - ray sources .",
    "( 5 ) cvs at minimum light can be rather faint ( @xmath5 ) , and a small handful have turned up in proper motion surveys .",
    "new , large samples of cvs with consistent selection criteria are potentially useful for clarifying issues such as the space density and orbital period distribution of these objects . because the colors of cvs overlap those of quasars , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) turned up a large number of spectroscopically confirmed cvs ( @xcite ; hereafter referred to as szkodyi - viii ) .",
    "@xcite compiled orbital periods for 137 of these ; with the sdss sample , they were finally able to discern the long - predicted period spike .",
    "like the sdss , the catalina real time survey ( crts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has discovered many new cvs .",
    "while the sdss cvs were originally selected by color  they were chosen for spectroscopy largely because their colors overlap those of quasars ",
    "the crts selects entirely by variability .",
    "briefly , the crts surveys most of the accessible sky at galactic latitudes @xmath6 and declination @xmath7 every lunation , using a 0.7 m schmidt telescope in the catalina mountains near tucson , arizona .",
    "they search for variability using a master catalog that reaches to @xmath8 .",
    "objects that show abrupt outbursts of @xmath9 mag amplitude lasting less than few weeks are classified as likely cvs , making the crts a prolific source of dwarf novae in particular .",
    "the crts maintains a catalog of `` confirmed / likely '' cvs on the world wide web .",
    "we downloaded this catalog on 2012 march 7 , when it contained 584 objects , and used this data set for the present analysis .",
    "the crts cv sample is of great interest because of its depth and selection criteria , so it is a natural choice for follow - up studies similar to @xcite . @xcite describe high - speed photometry of 20 objects , mostly from the crts , and give orbital periods for 15 , including two eclipsing dwarf novae and two superhumpers .",
    "only two of their sample had periods longer than the 2 - 3 hour period gap .",
    "the period distribution of their sample also showed the spike just above the turnaround .",
    "in addition , they found that dwarf novae with more recorded outbursts tended to have longer orbital periods than those with fewer outbursts .    here",
    ", we report on followup spectroscopy and photometry of the crts cvs listed in table [ tab : star_info ] .",
    "most of the crts cvs are too faint for us to follow up , so we selected this sample based largely on apparent brightness .",
    "operational considerations , such as the ease with which observations could be interleaved other programs , the nearness of the target to opposition at midnight , and ( for radial velocity targets ) the strength and tractability of emission and absorption spectra also entered into target selection .",
    "we find spectroscopic periods for 8 objects , one of which was independently measured by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we obtained exploratory spectra of 28 others , largely to assess their feasibility for radial - velocity studies .",
    "we also obtained standardized magnitudes for 37 objects ( 17 of which also have spectra ) .",

    "table [ tab : photometry ] gives magnitudes and colors of objects for which we have standardized photometry .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : statistics ] we consider how the crts cv samples overlaps with other lists of cvs , discuss the apparent selection biases of crts and the implications for the cv population in general .",
    "all our data are from mdm observatory on kitt peak , ariznoa . nearly all are from the 2.4 m hiltner telescope , but a single photometric measurement was kindly taken by j. halpern at the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope .",
    "the spectroscopic observing setups were as follows .    _",
    "modular spectrograph .",
    "_ for most of the spectra we used the modular spectrograph and a 600 line mm@xmath10 grating .",
    "the detector was either ` templeton ' , a 1024@xmath11 thinned site ccd that gave 2   pixel@xmath10 from 4600 to 6700  , or ` nellie ' , a thick 2048@xmath11 ccd that gave 1.7   pixel@xmath10 from 4460 to 7770  , with vignetting toward the ends of the range .",
    "the choice of detector was dictated by availability during a series of controller upgrades . with the modspec",
    ", targets are centered using the image reflected from the polished slit jaws . for this",
    ", we used new ( 2010 ) slit viewing optics and a self - contained andor ikon ccd camera unit ; this has greatly improved the acquisition of faint targets with this instrument .",
    "all of our radial - velocity time series were taken with the modular spectograph .",
    "for wavelength calibration we obtained comparison lamps in twilight and used the night - sky @xmath12 5577 line to track spectrograph flexure during the night .",
    "we also observed flux standards in twilight when the sky was clear , and bright o and b - type stars in order to correct approximately for telluric absorption .",

    "_ this versatile instrument @xcite images the focal plane onto a 4 k @xmath13 4 k ccd , at a scale of 0.273 arcsec pixel@xmath10 .",
    "filters can be placed in the parallel beam of the reducing camera for direct imaging , or volume - phase - holographic grism disperser can be inserted for spectroscopy . in spectroscopic mode , one can insert slits in two different locations in the focal plane , which yield different wavelength coverage ; we used the ` inner ' slit , which gives coverage from 3960 to 6875   at 0.75   pixel@xmath10 .",
    "osmos has no slit - viewing camera , so targets are acquired by taking a direct image ( without slit and disperser ) and then moving the telescope to align the target with the known location of the slit .",
    "we inserted a @xmath14 filter for the acquisition exposures , and therefore obtained a rough @xmath14 magnitude ( without a color transformation ) for our targets . some humid weather in 2011 september intermittently caused condensation in the center of the detector window ; fortunately , the important h@xmath15 feature was outside the affected region .    for most of the spectroscopic reduction we used iraf routines .",
    "to extract one - dimensional spectra from the modspec images , we used a local implementation of the optimal - extraction algorithm of @xcite .",
    "we computed synthetic @xmath14 magnitudes for our spectra using the passband tabulated by @xcite .",
    "our slit was usually 1.1 arcsec wide , which means that an unknown fraction of the light was lost ; also , many of our spectra were taken through thin cloud .",
    "experience suggests that our synthetic magnitudes are accurate to @xmath16 mag in good conditions ; in poor conditions , they can be considerably too faint .",
    "we selected eight of our targets for time - series radial velocity observations , with the aim of determining orbital periods .",
    "for these , we pushed observations to large hour angle in order to avoid daily cycle count aliases . to measure emission - line radial velocities we used the convolution algorithms described by @xcite ,",
    "in which an antisymmetric function is convolved with the line profile and the zero of the convolution is taken as the line center .",
    "we used methods described by @xcite to tune the convolution function for maximum signal .",
    "we estimated uncertainties in the velocities by propagating the counting - statistics errors in the spectral channels ; these estimates do not include possible systematic effects .",
    "for absorption - line velocities , we used the @xcite convolution algorithms as implemented by @xcite . to search for periods we used a ` residual - gram ' method described by @xcite .",
    "once we had established a period , we fit the time series with sinusoids of the form @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "uncertainties in the fit parameters were estimated from the scatter around the best fit using the procedure described by @xcite .    for direct imaging , we mostly used the ` nellie ' ccd , which gave 0.24   per pixel .",
    "this detector is insensitive in the ultraviolet , so we used @xmath18 filters ( although @xmath19 and @xmath20 were sometimes skipped ) .",
    "we derived photometric transformations from observations of @xcite standard stars .",

    ", this object also has a strong contribution from the secondary star . by comparing the spectrum with stars classified by @xcite , we estimate the secondary s spectral type to be k7 @xmath60 1 subtype , and find that the secondary s contribution is nominally equivalent to @xmath89 . however , many of the exposures used in the average spectrum were taken in partly cloudy conditions and mediocre seeing .",
    "our average spectrum has synthesized @xmath90 , but our best exposures have @xmath91 .",
    "the crts light curve shows that the source is fairly steady when not in outburst , at @xmath32 , consistent with our best exposures , so it appears that the mean spectrum from which the secondary magnitude was derived is about 0.6 mag too faint .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath92 for the secondary contribution .",
    "the emission - line radial velocities did not yield a period , but the absorption spectrum showed an unambiguous modulation at @xmath93 hr .",
    "the relatively small velocity amplitude of the secondary ( @xmath94 km s@xmath10 ) constrains the inclination to be fairly low for any realistic white dwarf mass , so eclipses are not expected .",
    "we can once again estimate a distance using the secondary s contribution , following the same procedure we used for css0647 + 49 . using @xcite as a guide , we estimate @xmath95 m@xmath66 , from which we infer @xmath96 r@xmath66 at this period . the surface brightness for k7",

    "secondary gives @xmath100 pc .",
    "the emission lines are notably broad  the fwhm of h@xmath15 is nearly 1700 km s@xmath10  and the lines show incipient double peaks , so the inclination is likely to be fairly high .",
    "even so , the radial velocity amplitude is modest .",
    "we detect a modulation in the emission line velocity , but with the available the choice of daily cycle count is ambiguous , so we give two possible periods in table [ tab : parameters ] . both possible periods are well below the 2 - 3 hour gap , so it is likely that this will prove to be an su uma - type dwarf nova with superoutbursts and superhumps .",
    "the spectrum is typical of dwarf novae at minimum light .",
    "we obtained radial velocities on a single night in 2011 june , after which the star went into outburst , suppressing the h@xmath15 emission and ending the measurements . in 2012",
    "may we obtained velocities on three consecutive nights . from the combined data we adopt a period near 0.0582 d , but periods near 0.111 d and 0.0552 d ( the latter being a daily cycle count alias of our adopted period )",
    "are not completely ruled out .",
    "the @xmath56 345 d gap in the time series created fine - scale ringing in the periodogram . to derive the period uncertainty in table [ tab : parameters ] , we shifted the 2012 may data back in time by an integer number of periods , removing the gap .",
    "the exact period used in this artificial shift has essentially no effect on the resulting period uncertainty .",
    "the spectrum shows weak m - dwarf features , in particular the extra continuum around 5950 - 6170  , and the band head near @xmath101 .",
    "the features are too weak to derive good constraints on the spectral type , but an m1.5 dwarf contributing around 25 per cent of the flux at 6500   gives a reasonably good match . as one might expect from the spectrum , the period is relatively long ; the best - fitting @xmath0 is 7.12(3 ) hr , or 3.37 cycle d@xmath10 ; however , we can not entirely rule out an alias at 4.45 cycle d@xmath10 , or 5.40 hr .",
    "as noted earlier , the crts cv sample is of great interest in characterizing the cv population . in this section",
    ", we consider what the crts sample can tell us about the completeness of the available cv sample .",
    "the number of non - cvs included in the crts sample appears to be small . in the sample of 36 objects for which we obtained spectra , we found only a single apparent non - cv .",
    "the fainter objects in the crts sample were beyond our magnitude limit , and it is possible that the fainter end of the sample includes a greater fraction of interlopers .",
    "however , the selection criterion  outbursts of more than 2 mag  should be fairly robust even for faint objects .",
    "we assume , then , that essentially all crts cvs are real cvs .",

    "the spectra    classified this way tended to have strong , broad balmer emission ( with    h@xmath15 equivalent width usually greater than 30   ) ,    relatively flat disk continua ( in @xmath102    vs.  @xmath12 ) , and weak or absent heii    @xmath124686 .",
    "objects showing blue continua and    white - dwarf absorption wings around h@xmath22 were    classified as dn - w ; if a k or m - type secondary was present , we    classified the object as dn-2 . in some cases",
    "the sdss spectrum shows    the object in outburst .",
    "dwarf novae in outburst can be difficult to    distinguish from novalike variables , but in these cases the flux level    in the spectrum will usually be much greater than expected based on    the imaging data .",
    "nl : :    this class included spectra showing blue continua , without white - dwarf    absorption , and relatively weak emission lines , or stronger emission    lines and substantial heii @xmath124686 ( typically half    the strength of h@xmath22 in those cases ) .",
    "the balmer    absorption wings in a novalike variable can superficially resemble    white - dwarf absorption , but with experience the distinctive    white - dwarf line profile can usually be distinguished from the disk    absorption lines seen in ux - uma type variables .",
    "am : :    these showed heii @xmath124686 similar in strength to    h@xmath22 , or other evidence of a strong magnetic field    such as cyclotron humps .",

    "one , sdss j1023 + 00 , has proven to be a binary containing a    millisecond radio pulsar @xcite .",
    "removing 14 apparent non - cvs from the sdss sample leaves us with 272 objects . because of the limited information  especially the lack of long - term light curves ",
    "the classifications should be considered somewhat rough .",
    "they are given in table [ tab : sdssclasses ] .",
    "_ the ritter - kolb catalog .",
    "_ @xcite have maintained a catalog ( hereafter rkcat ) of cvs and related object with known or suspected orbital periods .",
    "some of these were discovered in the crts , but entries that do not match with crts objects clearly were not . in our comparisons , we used the cataclysmic binary list , ` cbcat ' , from version 7.16 of the ritter - kolb catalog ( hereafter rkcat ) , which contains 926 objects , of which 582 are in the crts survey area .",
    "rkcat provides subclassifications similar to the ones we invented for the sdss sample .    _ the general catalog of variable stars .",
    "_ we downloaded the general catalog of variable stars @xcite ; the 2012 january version contains 45678 entries , of which 753 are classified as some kind of cv ( types n , na , nb , nc , nl , ug , ugss , ugsu , or am ) . of these , 287 are in the crts survey area .",
    "table [ tab : samplestats ] shows the number of cross - matches , and non - matches between the crts sample and the lists detailed in the previous section .",
    "there are only 44 cross - matches between the crts and the sdss cv samples .",
    "[ fig : sdsscrtshist ] shows histograms of the sdss sample and the crts objects that lie in the sdss footprint .",
    "note the following :    1 .   at minimum light , most of the crts objects are too faint to have been identified as cvs by sdss .",
    "the fainter crts objects are for the most part detected in the sdss imaging data ( provided they were in the sdss footprint ) , but were too faint to be selected for spectra .",
    "2 .   among the brighter crts objects ,",
    "somewhat more than half are not in the sdss sample .",
    "the top panel shows that only a rather small fraction of sdss objects are recovered by crts .",
    "why does crts miss so many cvs ?",
    "as noted earlier , one expects crts to preferentially select dwarf novae , and to be less sensitive to other cv subtypes .",
    "consistent with this , 40 of the 44 cross - matches between sdss and crts are objects that we classified as ` dn '",
    ". the rkcat and gcvs comparisons ( table [ tab : samplestats ] ) also show this tendency for crts to select dwarf novae ; of the 134 crts objects that are listed in sdss , rkcat , or gcvs , 123 of them are classified as dwarf novae in at least one of these catalogs , and only 11 are other kinds of cv .",
    "we therefore confirm that , as one might expect , cvs that are not dwarf novae are largely passed over by crts .",
    "the objects recovered by crts are mostly dwarf novae , but are the objects _ not _ recovered by crts _ not _ dwarf novae ? in the latter part of the table , we give the numbers of cvs that lie in the nominal crts survey area , but which are _ not _ recovered by crts .",
    "as expected , dwarf novae constitute a smaller portion of the unrecovered objects ; the aggregate dwarf nova fraction is 348/602 , rather than 123/134 .",
    "however , these figures also imply that over half the _ unrecovered _ objects actually _ are _ dwarf novae .",
    "somehow , 348 dwarf novae that we know of in the crts survey area have slipped through its net .",
    "how can we account for this ?",
    "some of these non - recoveries ( or ` misses ' ) are to be expected , because dwarf novae from one subclass  the wz sge stars ",
    "erupt very infrequently , in some cases on timescales of decades or more .",
    "an even more extreme example , the star gd 552 @xcite , appears identical to a short - period dwarf nova at minimum light , but it has _ no _ observed outbursts .",
    "some fraction of the wz sge stars will have been missed simply because they have not outburst during the @xmath103 years that crts has operated .    to explore the effect of outburst interval on crts selection , we used data from rkcat , which gives an average outburst interval ( which they denote @xmath104 ) for some of the listed dwarf novae .",
    "we arbitrarily chose 700 days , roughly half the time span of the crts survey , as the dividing line between short and long outburst intervals .",
    "in addition , we assigned to the long - interval group any dwarf nova subclassified as ` wz ' .",
    "many dwarf novae could not be assigned because because @xmath104 was not given ( and they were not classed as wz ) , but sufficient information existed to classify 137 dwarf novae from the crts footprint ; 95 of these were in the short - interval group , and 42 in the long - interval group .",
    "the objects that _ were _ recovered in crts included 18 from the short - interval group , and 9 from the long - interval group ; among rk dwarf novae that were _ not _ recovered by crts , there were 77 short - interval systems , and 33 long - interval systems .",
    "the fact that so many short - interval systems are _ not _ recovered by crts argues strongly that long outburst intervals are not the main reason crts is missing so many dwarf novae ( although it must account for some cases ) .",
    "indeed , the ratio of short to long interval dwarf novae for crts / rk matches is remarkably similar to the ratio in the group of rk dwarf novae that are not matched to crts .    the main reason for the incompleteness must therefore lie elsewhere .",
    "dwarf nova outbursts will be missed if they occur between observations .",
    "perusal of crts light curves suggests that some parts of the sky are covered rather infrequently .",
    "a good number of dwarf nova outbursts must therefore ` slip through the cracks ' in the coverage .",
    "this is exacerbated by the 2-magnitude criterion ; not only must the object be caught in outburst , but during that part of the outburst where it is more than 2 magnitudes above minimum . to see",
    "whether outburst amplitude might be an important selection factor , we again turned to rkcat , this time finding the outburst amplitude @xmath105 .",
    "for objects that did not have superoutburst magnitudes listed , we let @xmath106 ( in their notation ) , but if superoutburst magnitudes were available , we used @xmath107 .",
    "[ fig : outbcdf ] shows the cumulative distribution functions of @xmath105 for the recovered and unrecovered dwarf novae .",
    "as expected , crts is nearly blind to objects with @xmath108 ; more interestingly , there is a significant bias against smaller outburst amplitudes extending all the way up to @xmath109 .",
    "this effect probably arises because , in any given snapshot , a large - amplitude object will have a greater likelihood of being caught at @xmath110 than a small - amplitude object , which would have to be fairly close to its peak brightness in order to exceed the survey threshold .",
    "it seems , then , that the crts survey is biased toward large outburst amplitudes .",
    "how might this affect other quantities ?",
    "[ fig : amplvsper ] we plot @xmath105 against @xmath0 , for those dwarf novae in the crts footprint that have both quantities tabulated in rkcat .",
    "while there is a great deal of scatter at any given @xmath0 , there is a clear trend for short - period dwarf novae to have greater outburst amplitude , and hence a greater likelihood of being discovered by crts .",
    "the crts sample should therefore be biased toward shorter orbital periods .",
    "this must contribute at some level to the preponderance of short periods found in this paper and by @xcite .",
    "the fact that so many of the crts cv sample are new discoveries , and its continuing effectiveness in finding new ones , both show that a great many cvs remain undiscovered .",
    "future synoptic surveys with faster cadence , and less - stringent variability criteria should discover many more cvs .",
    "we obtained spectra of 36 crts cv candidates , and confirmed that all save one appear to be _ bona fide _ cvs . for eight of the objects we obtained spectroscopic periods , and found that three of them had @xmath0 longward of the 2 - 3 hour gap .",
    "in addition , we examined the overlap between the crts cv sample and others previously - existing samples .",
    "most crts cvs are new discoveries , but crts has not recovered even a majority of the known dwarf novae in its footprint .",
    "this suggests that a great many cvs remain undiscovered .",
    "analysis of the recovered and unrecovered samples shows that the crts sample is biased toward large outburst amplitudes , which in turn biases it toward shorter orbital periods .",

    "<S> nearly all the spectra are typical of cvs at minimum light . </S>",
    "<S> one object appears to be a flare star , while another has a spectrum consistent with a cv but lies , intriguingly , at the center of a small nebulosity . </S>",
    "<S> we measured orbital periods for eight of the cvs , and estimated distances for two based on the spectra of their secondary stars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the spectra , we obtained direct imaging for an overlapping sample of 37 objects , for which we give magnitudes and colors . </S>",
    "<S> most of our new orbital periods are shortward of the so - called period gap from roughly 2 to 3 hours . by considering the cross - identifications between the catalina objects and other catalogs such as the sloan digital sky survey </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that a large number of cataclysmic variables remain uncatalogued . by comparing the crts sample to lists of previously - known cvs that crts does not recover , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the crts is biased toward large outburst amplitudes ( and hence shorter orbital periods ) . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this is a consequence of the survey cadence . </S>"
