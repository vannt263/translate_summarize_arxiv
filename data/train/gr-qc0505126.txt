    "while the cosmic acceleration becomes one of the most exciting discoveries of the cosmology @xcite the nature of the dark energy which is still unknown @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are very weak constraints on its form of an equation of state @xcite .",
    "the most popular candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath6 , which can be treated as some kind of perfect fluid satisfying the equation of state @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "however , it remains to explain why value of @xmath6 , obtained from type ia supernovae ( snia ) observations , is so small in comparison with the value of @xmath6 interpreted as vacuum energy ( i.e. , the planck mass scale ) .",
    "recent investigations in this field concentrate mainly on the dark energy , modelled as @xmath9 quintessence scalar field @xcite or @xmath10 based on barotropic equation of state @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume the general form of the equation of state in which the equation of state factor @xmath11 of total matter depends on redshift @xmath3 through the scale factor @xmath2 , so @xmath12 , @xmath13 in some nonempty interval of evolution .",
    "it is characteristic the existence of large variety of different dark energy models @xcite .",
    "we unify all these models assuming that dark energy obeys the general form of the equation of state @xmath14 .",
    "it is interesting to find some general properties of an evolutional path of such models . for this aim",
    "dynamical system methods seem to be a natural method because it offers the possibility of investigating whole space of solutions starting from all admissible initial conditions . the philosophy of qualitative investigation of differential equations shifts interest from founding their exact solutions toward investigating their sensitivity ( or fragility ) with respect to small changes of initial conditions or model parameters .",
    "it is demonstrated that dynamics of the frw model with dark energy can be represented in the form of two - dimensional dynamical system , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the phase portraits of this system are organized by critical points @xmath18 or limit cycles ( non - point - like attractors ) .",
    "following the hartman - grobman theorem in neighborhood of non - hyperbolic critical points @xcite ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are eigenvalues of linearization matrix @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the jacobi matrix ) the nonlinear matrix is equivalent to its linearization .",
    "the full knowledge of dynamical behavior requires analyzing its behavior at infinity . to achieve this",
    "it is useful to transform trajectories from a @xmath23 phase plane into a poincar sphere @xcite .",
    "then infinitely distant points of the plane are mapped into a sphere s equator @xmath24 .",
    "the type of critical points are conserved under this mapping but critical points present in infinity can appear at the equator .",
    "hence an orthogonal projection of any hemisphere onto the tangent plane gives a compactified phase portrait .",
    "the main subject of this paper is presentation how dynamics of the frw model with dynamical dark energy can be reduced to the form of a two - dimensional dynamical system ( section  [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "the general properties of such a system are investigated in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "we find that a global structure of the compactified phase space @xmath25 depends on the strong energy condition only . in section  [ sec:4 ] we present advantages of using a complementary description of dynamics as a hamiltonian flow . in this picture",
    "the evolution of the model is represented as a motion of unit mass in the one - dimensional potential @xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting that a shape of the diagram of @xmath4 contain all informations which are needed to determine all critical points at the finite domain as well as at infinity and their character .",
    "the detailed discussion of this issue and the compactified phase portraits contain section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we find only three generic cases of the phase portraits .",
    "all frw models with a postulated form of dark energy belong to the one from distinguished class of phase portraits modulo homeomorphism preserving orientation of the phase curves ( which establish equivalence of the phase portraits ) .",
    "therefore it is possible to classify all frw dark energy models on the phase portraits without some details about the specific form of the equation of state .",
    "let us consider the frw model with source in the form of noninteracting dust matter and dark energy which the equation of state is parameterized by @xmath26 , @xmath27 . then from the conservation condition @xmath28 where a dot denotes the differentiation with respect to time @xmath29",
    ", we obtain for each component relations @xmath30 hence we can combine both effects and define the total pressure as @xmath31 where the equation of state factor for total matter is @xmath32 where @xmath33 are density parameters for both matter and dark energy , @xmath2 is expressed in the units of its present value @xmath34 .    in our further analysis",
    "we assume the equation of state in form ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "note that the coefficient of state @xmath35 can be always extracted from the integral differential equation @xmath36 equivalent to the differential equation @xmath37 which the solution , for the initial condition @xmath38 , is in the form @xmath39 due to ( [ eq:6 ] ) it is possible to determine @xmath35 provided that @xmath40 is given .",
    "the frw dynamics is governed by equations @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are effective energy density and pressure respectively ; @xmath44 in the model under consideration , @xmath45  the curvature index @xmath46 .",
    "system ( [ eq:7 ] ) together with condition ( [ eq:1 ] ) is closed if the form of the equation of state ( [ eq:3 ] ) is postulated .",
    "then the basic dynamical equations reduce to @xmath47 note that expression @xmath48 plays the role of first integral ( [ eq:8 ] ) if @xmath49 equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) constitute a two - dimensional autonomous dynamical system which solutions can be visualized in the phase plane @xmath50 .",
    "then ( [ eq:9 ] ) represents the equation for an algebraic curve on which lies solutions of the dynamical system . among all solutions there exist singular solutions represented by critical points in the phase plane . at the finite domain of the phase plane they always represent static universes @xmath51 @xmath52 they are located on @xmath2-axis , and exist if",
    "only @xmath53 for effective pressure and energy density .",
    "there are two possibilities : @xmath54 or @xmath55 for appearing such a points .",
    "if @xmath40 is a monotonic function of @xmath2 then there is one solution @xmath56 .",
    "note that for all critical points the function @xmath57 . because it is always the non - positive function",
    "if only @xmath58 the critical points are admissible in the region occupied by trajectories of the closed model @xmath59 .    following the first integral ( [ eq:9 ] ) the whole phase space @xmath50",
    "is divided on two disjoint domains by the trajectory of the flat model . in these regions",
    "we find closed models in the region @xmath60 while open models are situated in the region @xmath61 of the phase space .",
    "the boundary of the strong energy condition @xmath62 defines the line in the phase space which separates regions occupied by non - accelerating and accelerating phases of evolution of the models .",
    "the assumed form of the equation of state includes different dark energy models .",
    "for example the chaplygin gas can be treated as a special case of some prescribed form of the equation of state @xcite . in this case",
    "we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath22 , @xmath65 are positive constants . from ( [ eq:12 ] )",
    "one can seen that @xmath11 varies in the interval @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "it is a monotonic ( decreasing ) function of @xmath2 .",
    "if we consider the equation of state for a non - interacting mixture of dust ( @xmath67 ) and radiation matter then we obtain the equation of state in the form @xmath68 which can be reproduced by @xmath69 @xmath70 freese and lewis @xcite have recently considered models ( called cardassian ) which are alternative to dark energy models . following their approach",
    "the source of acceleration is in some modification of frw dynamics instead of dark energy conditions .",
    "one can show that the cardassian models are equivalent to dark energy models for two components of matter .",
    "the basic equations are @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the hubble function and @xmath73 is energy density of radiation matter : @xmath74 is the assumption of the model , @xmath75 is the model parameter and @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath40 is given by formula ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "therefore , assumed for ( [ eq:3 ] ) of equation of state seems to be sufficiently general to unify all cosmological models which offers explanation of snia data ( note that it is also valid of the linder and copeland model ) .    because we assume the presence of dust matter we have @xmath78 but in general for the fluid violating the weak energy condition @xmath79 it is possible to have the critical point @xmath80",
    ". then @xmath81 and @xmath82 , therefore eigenvalues of the linearization matrix are real of positive signs which correspond to saddles points",
    ". note that in this case there are no static critical points at @xmath83 in the finite domain .",
    "the phase space of the model is organized by critical points and phase curves determined from the first integral ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",

    "consequently the sign of the determinant @xmath22 determines the type of the critical points , i.e. , whether @xmath89 is real or complex .",
    "it is consequence of the fact that @xmath90 because at the critical points we have @xmath91 we have @xmath92 the critical points of the system can be saddle points if @xmath93 or centers in the opposite case if @xmath94 . in the first case eigenvalues are real of opposite signs while in the second case they are purely imaginary and conjugated .",
    "the determinant of the linearization matrix can by rewritten to the form @xmath95 therefore if we consider critical points appearing at @xmath96 then @xmath97 and the type of critical points depends on sign of @xmath98 at the critical point @xmath99 ( we assume @xmath100 ) . if @xmath101 is a decreasing function of the scale factor then the critical points are saddle types .    if we consider the second type of critical points which is the static critical point located at @xmath102 such that @xmath103 then first term in ( [ eq:20 ] ) decides whether the critical points are saddles or centers . therefore if @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) then @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) if @xmath108 ( like for phantom fields violating the weak energy condition @xmath109 ) .",

    "finally one can conclude that if we assume positivity of energy of each component then the existence as well as character of the critical points are determined by energy conditions in the neighborhood of the transition moment corresponding the inflection of the diagram @xmath112 .",
    "from the physical point of view it is moment of hanging decelerating phase into accelerating one .",
    "the full knowledge of dynamical behavior requires an analysis of the system at infinity .",

    "there is an easy test for the structural stability of the global phase portrait of planar polynomial system . in particular , the phase portraits on the poincar sphere are structurally unstable if there are non - hyperbolic points at infinity or if there is a trajectory connecting a saddle on the equator if the poincar sphere to another saddle on @xmath233 ( @xcite p.322 ) .",
