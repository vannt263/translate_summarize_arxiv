    "the concept of quantum entanglement is crucial to the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics , including the quantum measurement and quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "it also dominates the development of quantum information science and technology . at this stage , implementing the realistic quantum computation and communication , one needs to create the maximally quantum entanglement for potentially physical carrier of quantum information .    as potential candidates of information carrier in quantum computation , some kinds of qubit based on josephson junctions @xcite , such as charge qubit , phase qubit and flux qubit , have been implemented experimentally .",
    "now single qubit operation and two qubit logic gate based on josephson junctions demonstrate an important role to realize a scalable quantum computing .",
    "recent experiments demonstrate the rabi oscillation in a cooper - pair box ( charge qubit ) @xcite and indicate existence of entangled two - qubit states @xcite . up to now , the decoherence time which is of order @xmath0 has been reported in @xcite . in the process of quantum computing , we need qubits with long decoherence time , so we must find a longer life time medium to store the state of qubit .",
    "the microwave cavity is a good candidate which life time is of order @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "actually quantum information storage is the central issues in the study of quantum information and computation @xcite .    in this paper , we describe a model of a charge qubit coupled to a single mode quantum cavity field . under the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , we demonstrate how to implement a dynamic process of quantum information storage in the qubit - cavity system .",
    "in addition , we consider the entanglement and engineered decoherence of the qubit - cavity system .",
    "in fact , the integration of qubit and cavity qed @xcite has become the focus of quantum information storage and quantum computation . in order to investigate quantum coherence and information storage in the qubit - cavity system",
    ", we consider a single mode quantum cavity field with frequency @xmath2 ( typically in the microwave domain ) coupled to a charge qubit ( with dc squid ) in which the charging energy @xmath3 and the josephson coupling energy @xmath4 nakamura02 .",
    "the charge qubit considered in this paper is a dc squid consisting of two identical josephson junctions enclosed by a superconducting loop .",
    "the hamiltonian for an dc squid can be written as in @xcite @xmath5where @xmath6 is the charging energy , @xmath7 josephson coupling energy and we assume @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the magnetic flux generated by controlled classical magnetic field and quantum cavity field .",
    "quasi - spin operators @xmath10are defined in the charge qubit basis ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 denotes the flux quanta .",
    "now we consider the case that the magnetic flux threading the dc squid is generated by magnetic field @xmath14 consisting of external classical magnetic field @xmath15 and quantum cavity field @xmath16 , i.e. ,",
    "@xcite @xmath17 so the total magnetic flux threading squid is also divided into two parts@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the external classical flux threading the dc squid , @xmath20 the cavity - induced quantum flux through the dc squid and @xmath21 any area bounded by the dc squid .",
    "we assume that there exists a single mode standing wave cavity field of frequency @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the quantum cavity field is assumed to be transverse with respect to the magnetic field @xmath16 polarized in the y - direction , i.e. , @xmath23where @xmath24 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the single mode cavity field and @xmath25 the electromagnetic mode volume in cavity .    in fig.[cavity ] , the dc squid lies in the x - z plane and at the position of the antinode of standing wave field , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "then the magnetic field @xmath27 will be    @xmath28and magnetic flux @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 in this case , we can derive the spin - boson hamiltonian from eq.([ham1 ] ) in a straightforward way , @xmath31where @xmath32and @xmath33    as shown in fig.[cavity ] , two spherical mirrors form microwave cavity containing a single mode standing wave field and an external classical magnetic field is also injected into the cavity . in this paper , we adopt some appropriate parameters for the geometry of cavity , the curvature radius @xmath34 mm , the width between two mirrors @xmath35 cm . by some simple calculations , we get that the cavity field @xmath36(tesla ) and @xmath37 . in a low photon number cavity ,",
    "we find that @xmath38 , thus there is only a weak polynomial nonlinearity in eq.([ham5 ] ) .",
    "any quantum computer realized in a laboratory will be subject to the influence of environmental noise in the preparation , manipulation , and measurement of quantum - mechanical states which causes quantum decoherence . in the implementation of quantum computation , quantum information should be encoded in a quantum network formed by many qubits with longer decoherence time .",
    "subsequently one can store , manipulate and communicate quantum information @xcite .",
    "so we are interested in study of quantum information - storage .    now up to the first order of @xmath39 in eq.([ham5 ] ) , we consider quantum information - storage in the qubit - cavity system . to this end",
    ", we adopt the appropriate parameters , i.e. , the frequency of microwave cavity at @xmath2 and the charging energy of charge qubit at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "when we tune gate voltage of josephson junction at @xmath41 , the rwa is valid .    in this section ,",
    "we consider the storage of quantum information of the charge qubit in the cavity mode .",
    "we derive the hamiltonian for qubit - cavity system from eq.([ham5 ] ) , @xmath42it is just as same as a jaynes - cummings model @xcite in optical cavity qed .",
    "now we demonstrate a process of quantum information transfer from one charge qubit to cavity field .",
    "we assume that the initial state of charge qubit is in an arbitrary state @xmath43 and we want transfer this state from charge qubit to cavity that its initial state is in the vacuum state @xmath44 .",
    "the process of information storage from qubit to cavity can be described by @xmath45    from eq.([storage ] ) , we find that this information - storage process could be done with a transformation @xcite@xmath46 we can easily verify that the hamiltonian in eq.([rwa - ham ] ) holds the condition of information storage in eq.([rule ] ) , i.e. , @xmath47    now the process of quantum state transfer from the charge qubit to microwave cavity can be realized in the following steps .",
    "firstly at the time @xmath48 , we turn off the external classical field and prepare the initial state of qubit in the pure state @xmath49 corresponding to the reduced density matrix of the qubit@xmath50 where @xmath51 , the cavity is prepared in the vacuum state @xmath44 .",
    "the initial state of the qubit - cavity system can be written as @xmath52    secondly with time increasing , we turn on the external classical field and allow the qubit and microwave cavity to interact on resonance .",
    "then the state of the qubit - cavity system evolves into @xmath53 corresponding to the reduced density matrix of the cavity @xmath54 obviously , we find that when @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the transfer of quantum information occurs when @xmath57 or @xmath58 , @xmath59 and the state of the qubit - cavity system evolves into the state @xmath60 where the cavity is in the pure state @xmath61 from eq.([init - storage ] ) and eq.([time - storage ] ) , we can say that at time @xmath58 , the quantum information contained in the qubit has been stored in the microwave cavity .    as shown in fig.[t6 ] , we set @xmath62 and demonstrate the probability of that quantum information of the qubit is transferred to the microwave cavity @xmath63we find that the qubit transfers the quantum information to the microwave cavity at the time @xmath64 .    .",
    "the qubit transfer quantum information to the microwave cavity when the probability is equal to 1.,width=302 ]",
    "in previous work on cavity qed @xcite , raimond et al dealt with entanglement and decoherence for the cavity - atom system and show a reversible decoherence process of a mesoscopic superposition of field states . in this paper ,",
    "our model is quite similar to a cavity qed model without the rotation - wave - approximation ( rwa ) , which usually describes the single mode cavity interacting with an two - level atom @xcite . in this cavity qed model , when the atoms in different states @xmath65 and @xmath66 will modify the states of cavity field in different ways and thus induce the quantum decoherence of atomic states superposition . in this section ,",
    "we consider these issues about entanglement and decoherence in the qubit - cavity system .",
    "now we consider a single charge qubit ( dc squid ) coupled to a single - mode cavity . according to eq.([ham5 ] ) , we tune the gate voltage @xmath67 such that @xmath68 and then get a hamiltonian for a standard quantum measurement model , @xmath69    by some simple calculations from eq.([m - ham ] ) , we derive an effective hamiltonian , @xmath70which is diagonal with respect to @xmath71 and @xmath72 are eigenstates of quasi spin operator @xmath73 .",
    "the effective actions on cavity field are @xmath74for @xmath75 respectively . obviously the hamiltonian in eq.([e - ham ] ) can create entanglement between charge qubit and cavity field . since the different actions on the cavity field are exerted by the charge qubit in different quasi - spin state .",
    "technically the engineered decoherence process is described by the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the coupled qubit - cavity system . to analyze it , we can derive the reduced density matrix for the time evolution of the qubit - cavity system .",
    "the decoherence process means that the off diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the qubit vanish , while the diagonal elements remain unchanged .",
    "here we get time evolution of density matrix for the qubit - cavity system @xmath76 and calculate the reduced density matrix of the qubit @xmath77    we usually define decoherence factor as a measure of the coherence of system @xcite , @xmath78 at time @xmath48 , the decoherence factor @xmath79 , i.e. , the system owns good coherence .",
    "as time passes @xmath80 , the decoherence factor is not equal to one , @xmath81 . due to the coupling between qubit and cavity , quantum information of the qubit",
    "continuously leaks into the cavity , until the states of the cavity correlated to the different states of the system become orthogonal , i.e. , @xmath82 and the quantum information contained in the qubit can be described classically .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the qubit turns continuously into a incoherent mixture .    because @xmath38 , we expand @xmath83 into a series of @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) to the second order of @xmath86 and then get @xmath87 \\sigma _ { x}+\\omega a^{\\dagger } a   \\label{ham6}\\]]where @xmath88and @xmath89are the first order interaction strength and the second order interaction strength  respectively . clearly the above",
    "hamiltonian includes the interaction terms of @xmath90 , which drives the cavity field into the coherent state and the interaction with terms of @xmath91 which drives the cavity field into the squeezed state .    in this paper , we control the interaction between qubit and cavity by changing the strength of the external classical field , i.e. , @xmath92 . from eq.([ham6 ] ) , if we turn off the external field , i.e. , @xmath93 , the above hamiltonian only includes the second order interaction .",
    "if we turn on the external magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath94 , the above hamiltonian only includes the first order interaction .",
    "now we choose the coherent state @xmath95 as the initial state of quantum cavity field .",
    "it is not difficult to prepare such quasi - classical state by a driving current source . through some simple calculations , we find that the hamiltonian in eq.([ham6 ] ) containing terms of @xmath96 and @xmath97 will drive the cavity field into two different squeezed states @xmath98where @xmath99and @xmath100 when the time @xmath48 , for @xmath75 respectively . here",
    "the squeezed states @xmath101 is defines as in @xcite for a new set of boson operators wang02 @xmath102(for @xmath75 ) which hold @xmath103    then the time evolution of decoherence factor which characters the quantum coherence of the charge qubit is @xmath104     with @xmath105 and different @xmath106 respectively ( from top to down ) .",
    "when @xmath107 , the second order interaction in eq.([ham6 ] ) induces collapses and revivals of quantum coherence . when @xmath108 , the qubit owns the least loss of quantum coherence.,width=302 ]     with @xmath109",

    "typically in fig.[t0 ] and fig.[t3 ] , the time evolution of decoherence factor @xmath111 demonstrates an engineered decoherence process .",
    "we find that the very sharp peaks in @xmath112 curves may originate from the reversibility of the schrdinger equation for few body system and we called them quantum jumps @xcite , i.e. , the quantum coherence for charge qubit exhibits collapses and revivals . in fig.cavity ,",
