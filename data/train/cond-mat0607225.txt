    "the so - called hop - diffusion of membrane proteins or lipids observed in cell membranes indicates that the cytoskeleton forms compartments on the surface @xcite .",
    "it has also been recognized that the cytoskeleton of cell membranes maintains its cell shape against external forces , and plays important roles in cell motion , deformation and in some other functions .",
    "the mechanical strength of the cell is considered to be provided by cytoskeletons .",
    "some artificial membranes are considered to have skeletons , because they are partly polymerized @xcite .",
    "a well - known conventional model for such cell membranes is the curvature model of helfrich , polyakov and kleinert ( hpk ) @xcite .",
    "the cell membranes are considered to be a two - dimensional surface in the hpk prescription , and therefore the two dimensional differential geometry is suited to describe the shape and their corresponding properties @xcite .",
    "however , the skeleton is not considered in those curvature models .",
    "skeleton models for the cytoskeleton were investigated in @xcite .",
    "a hard - wall and a hard - core potential were assumed on the polymer chains with junctions , and the responses to some external stresses and the compression modulus were extracted from the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation data @xcite .",
    "the compartmentalized structure was recently investigated in the framework of the hpk model @xcite .",
    "a fluid surface undergoes a phase transition due to the compartment .    however , phase transitions of skeleton surface models are yet to be studied .",
    "the terminology _ skeleton surface model _ in this paper denotes a surface model with skeletons ; that is _ surface _ + _ skeleton _ , where the _ surface _ denotes the ordinary two - dimensional surface and the _ skeleton _",
    "denotes one - dimensional elastic chains with junctions .",
    "it is expected that skeletons can make the surface smooth against the surface fluctuations .",
    "therefore it is interesting to see whether the crumpling transition occurs in such skeleton surface models .",
    "the transition is the one that has long been studied theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite on the basis of the hpk model , and an experimental investigation on the transition has also been performed recently @xcite .",
    "we consider that the problem of whether the skeleton surface model undergoes the phase transition or not is non - trivial .",
    "in fact , we know that one - dimensional objects , such as an elastic ring obeying a hamiltonian for the local interactions , has no phase transition .    in this paper , we study the phase structure of a spherical skeleton surface model , which is defined on a triangulated spherical surface with polymer chains linked to each other at junctions , focusing on how the smooth phase separated from the crumpled phase .",
    "the hamiltonian is a linear combination of the gaussian bond potential @xmath1 , the one - dimensional bending energy @xmath2 on the polymer chain , and the two - dimensional bending energy @xmath3 at the junctions .",
    "the interaction in the model is not purely one - dimensional .",
    "one - dimensional polymer chains have two - dimensional interactions through the two - dimensional potential @xmath1 and the two - dimensional bending energy @xmath3 at the junctions , which are considered to be the boundary of polymer chains .",
    "however , it is obvious that the elastic skeletons maintain the shape of the membrane , because triangulated surfaces have no two - dimensional bending elasticity except at the junctions of skeletons .",
    "we will find a first - order transition in the model under certain conditions on the length of the polymer chains and the bending rigidity for @xmath3 .",
    "although the model is allowed to self - intersect and , hence , phantom , our results indicate a possible phase transition in biological or artificial membranes whose mechanical strength is provided by the cytoskeletons .",

    "we fix the chain length @xmath7 to the following two values : @xmath27 which respectively correspond to the values @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the total number of vertices inside a compartment @xcite .",

    "we use the unit of length provided by @xmath55 in this paper , although @xmath50 can arbitrarily be chosen .",
