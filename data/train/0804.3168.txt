    "cluster algebras were invented by fomin and zelevinsky in 2001 @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations for introducing this new class of commutative algebras was to provide a combinatorial and algebraic framework for studying the canonical bases of quantum groups introduced by lusztig and kashiwara @xcite and the notion of total positivity for semisimple algebraic groups developed by lusztig @xcite .",
    "a first attempt to understand cluster algebras in terms of the representation theory of quivers was done by marsh , reineke , and zelevinsky @xcite , using a category of decorated representations .",
    "this was quickly followed by the seminal paper of buan , marsh , reiten , reineke , and todorov @xcite who introduced a new family of triangulated categories attached to hereditary algebras , called cluster categories , and showed that the combinatorics of cluster mutations arises in the tilting theory of these cluster categories .",
    "this yielded a categorification of a large family of cluster algebras : the acyclic cluster algebras .    in this review , we will explain a different but somewhat parallel development aimed at giving a representation - theoretic treatment for another class of cluster algebras , namely those discovered by berenstein , fomin and zelevinsky @xcite in relation with their series of works on total positivity and the geometry of double bruhat cells in semisimple groups . instead of the cluster categories we have used the module categories of the preprojective algebras corresponding to these semisimple groups , and more generally certain frobenius subcategories of these module categories .",
    "this allowed us to prove that the cluster monomials of the cluster algebras we consider belong to the dual of lusztig s semicanonical basis , and in particular are linearly independent @xcite .",
    "it also enabled us to introduce new cluster algebra structures on the coordinate rings of partial flag varieties @xcite .",
    "before reviewing our construction , we would like to illustrate by means of some simple examples why total positivity , canonical bases and cluster algebras are intimately connected .",
    "lusztig has defined the totally positive part @xmath0 for several classes of complex algebraic varieties @xmath1 attached to a semisimple algebraic group @xmath2 .",
    "the definition uses the theory of canonical bases for irreducible @xmath2-modules .",
    "it is not our intention in this survey to explain this definition , neither to recall the construction of canonical bases ( for excellent reviews of these topics , we refer the reader to @xcite ) . instead of this",
    ", we shall present a few examples for which both the totally positive varieties and the canonical bases can be described in an explicit and elementary way .",
    "we shall then see that a cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring naturally arises from this description .",
    "our first example is trivial , but nevertheless useful to get started .",
    "let @xmath3 be an even dimensional vector space with natural coordinates @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the corresponding projective space .",
    "in this case our group @xmath2 is @xmath6 .",
    "the totally positive part of @xmath7 is simply the orthant @xmath8 and the totally positive part of @xmath1 is the subset of @xmath1 consisting of points having a system of homogeneous coordinates @xmath9 with all @xmath10 positive .",
    "the coordinate ring of @xmath7 ( or the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath1 ) is @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "it has a natural @xmath12-basis given by all monomials in the @xmath10 s .",
    "the natural action of @xmath2 on @xmath7 makes @xmath13 into a linear representation of @xmath2 , which decomposes into irreducible representations as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the degree @xmath16 homogeneous part of @xmath13 . for every irreducible representation of @xmath2 , lusztig and kashiwara",
    "have introduced a canonical basis and a dual canonical basis ( also called lower global basis and upper global basis by kashiwara ) .",
    "it is not difficult to check that , in the case of the simple representations @xmath17 , the dual canonical basis coincides with the basis of monomials in the @xmath10 s of total degree @xmath16 .",
    "we now pass to a more interesting example .",
    "consider the nondegenerate quadratic form on @xmath7 given by @xmath18 let @xmath19 be its isotropic cone and @xmath20 the corresponding smooth quadric in @xmath21 .",
    "the quadric @xmath22  can be seen as a partial flag variety for the special orthogonal group @xmath23 attached to the form @xmath24 , and so it has , following lusztig @xcite , a well - defined totally positive part .",
    "let us try to guess what is @xmath25 , or equivalently what is @xmath26 .",
    "it seems natural to require that @xmath26 is contained in @xmath27 .",
    "but this is not enough , and in general @xmath26 is going to be a proper subset of @xmath28 . to see this",
    ", we may use the known fact that the totally positive part of a variety of dimension @xmath16 is homeomorphic to @xmath29 , hence we might expect that it is described by a system of @xmath16 inequalities .",
    "however , @xmath28 is the subset of @xmath30 given by the @xmath31 inequalities @xmath32 , and since @xmath30 has dimension @xmath33 , we would like to define @xmath26 by a system of only @xmath33 inequalities .",
    "in other words , there should exist a system of @xmath33 functions @xmath34 on @xmath30 such that @xmath35 such a system @xmath34 is called a _ positive coordinate system_.    so we are looking for a `` natural '' set of @xmath33 functions @xmath34 such that the positivity of @xmath36 implies the positivity of @xmath37 .",
    "let us try this idea in the case @xmath38 .",
    "we have @xmath39 on @xmath28 we therefore have the relation @xmath40 hence the positivity of the 5 coordinates in the right - hand side implies the positivity of @xmath41 , that is , the defining equation of @xmath30 allows to eliminate the inequality @xmath42 from the 6 defining inequalities of @xmath28 .",
    "so we could take @xmath43 as a positive coordinate system .",
    "note that @xmath44 and @xmath41 play the same role and are exchangeable : we could also take @xmath45 .",
    "this would define the same subset @xmath26 , which in this case is simply @xmath28 .    already in the case",
    "@xmath46 the same trick no longer works .",
    "indeed , the defining equation of @xmath30 is now @xmath47 , which does not allow us to express any of the @xmath10 s as a subtraction - free expression in terms of the 7 remaining ones . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we introduce a new quadratic function @xmath48 on @xmath30 .",
    "on @xmath28 we then have @xmath49 and this leads us to take @xmath50 as a positive coordinate system .",
    "again , @xmath44 and @xmath51 are exchangeable , as are @xmath52 and  @xmath53 .",
    "so we would obtain the same subset @xmath26 by using , instead of ( [ eq2 ] ) , each of the 3 alternative systems of coordinates @xmath54 note that in this case our candidate for @xmath26 is a proper subset of @xmath28 , since the positivity of @xmath55 does not follow from the positivity of the @xmath10 s .",
    "it turns out that this naive candidate coincides with the totally positive part of @xmath30 defined by lusztig . to explain this ,",
    "let us consider the coordinate ring @xmath56/(y_1y_8 - y_2y_7 + y_3y_6 -y_4y_5)\\ ] ] of @xmath30 , or in other words the homogeneous coordinate ring of the quadric @xmath22 .",
    "as before , @xmath57 is in a natural way a representation of the special orthogonal group @xmath23 , and the homogeneous components @xmath58 coincide with the irreducible direct summands of this representation .",
    "hence by putting together the dual canonical bases of all summands @xmath59 , we get a dual canonical basis of @xmath57 .",
    "we claim that in this easy situation , the dual canonical basis can be explicitly computed and has the following simple description .",
    "namely , the dual canonical basis of @xmath59 consists of all the degree @xmath16 monomials in @xmath60 containing only variables of _ one _ of the 4 coordinate systems displayed in ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath61 have degree 1 and @xmath55 has degree 2 .",
    "for example , the dual canonical basis of @xmath62 is @xmath63 , and the dual canonical basis of @xmath64 consists of @xmath55 and of all the degree 2 monomials in the @xmath10 s except @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "now , lusztig has shown ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 , th .",
    "3.4 ) that @xmath26 has the following characterization : it consists of all elements @xmath67 of @xmath68",
    "such that , for every element @xmath69 of the dual canonical basis of @xmath59 and for every @xmath16 , one has @xmath70 . because of the monomial description of the dual canonical basis , we see that this agrees with our naive definition of @xmath26 .    guess in a similar way what is the definition of @xmath26 for @xmath71 .    for @xmath72 ,",
    "put @xmath73 then @xmath26 is the subset of @xmath30 given by the following @xmath74 inequalities @xmath75 together with _",
    "one _ ( it does not matter which one ) of the two inequalities @xmath76 for each @xmath77 .    thus for every @xmath78 , @xmath26 can be described as in ( [ eq1 ] ) by a positive coordinate system , and there are @xmath79 different but equivalent such systems .",
    "in fact , one can also check that the dual canonical basis of the coordinate ring of @xmath30 consists of all monomials in the @xmath10 s and @xmath80 s supported on _ one _ of these @xmath79 coordinate systems .",
    "the definition of a cluster algebra will be recalled in section  [ newsect ] below .",
    "a reader already familiar with it will immediately recognize an obvious cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring of @xmath30 emerging from this discussion .",
    "its @xmath81 _ cluster variables _ are @xmath82 its _ coefficient ring _ is generated by @xmath83 its _ clusters _ are the @xmath79 possible choices of @xmath33 of these functions forming a positive coordinate system .",
    "cluster monomials _ are all the monomials supported on a single cluster , and its _ exchange relations _ are @xmath84 p_{k-1}+p_{k-2 } & \\mbox{if $ 3\\le k \\le n-2$,}\\\\[2 mm ] y_ny_{n+1}+p_{n-3 } & \\mbox{if $ k = n-1$. } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] this is a cluster algebra of finite type ( it has finitely many cluster variables ) .",
    "its type , according to fomin and zelevinsky s classification @xcite is @xmath85 .    to summarize , the cone @xmath30 and the corresponding quadric @xmath22 are examples of algebraic varieties for which lusztig has described a natural totally positive subset @xmath26 or @xmath25 .",
    "what we have found is that their coordinate ring is endowed with the structure of a cluster algebra such that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\(1 ) each cluster gives rise to a positive coordinate system ;    \\(2 ) the dual canonical basis of the coordinate ring coincides with the set of cluster monomials . _",

    "but in general , things become more complicated .",
    "first , the cluster algebra structure , when it is known , is usually well - hidden , and its description requires a lot of difficult ( but beautiful ) combinatorics . as an example , one may consult the paper of scott @xcite and in particular the cluster structures of the grassmannians @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "secondly , these cluster algebras are generally of infinite type so one can not hope for a closed and finite description as in the above example .",
    "this is not too bad if one is mainly interested in total positivity , since one may not necessarily need to know _ all _ positive coordinate systems on @xmath1 .",
    "but it becomes a challenging issue if one aims at a monomial description of the dual canonical basis of the coordinate ring , because that would likely involve infinitely many families of monomials .",
    "in fact such a monomial description may not even be possible , since , as shown in @xcite , there may exist elements of the dual canonical basis whose square does not belong to the basis . in any case , even if the cluster structure is known , more work is certainly needed to obtain from it a full description of the dual canonical basis .",
    "finally , there is no universal recipe for getting a cluster structure on the coordinate ring .",
    "actually , the existence of such a structure is not guaranteed by any general theorem , so it often seems kind of miraculous when it eventually comes out of some complicated calculations .",
    "the aim of this review is to explain some recent progress made in these directions by means of the representation theory of preprojective algebras .",
    "we will choose as our main example the partial flag varieties @xmath1 attached to a simple algebraic group @xmath2 of type @xmath89 . thus @xmath1 is a homogeneous space @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a parabolic subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "to @xmath2 one can attach the preprojective algebra @xmath92 with the same dynkin type . to @xmath91 ( or rather to its conjugacy class ) one can attach a certain injective @xmath92-module @xmath93 , and the subcategory @xmath94 of the module category @xmath95 cogenerated by @xmath93 .",
    "we will show that @xmath94 can be regarded as a categorification of the multihomogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath1 , and that the rigid modules in @xmath94 give rise to a cluster structure on this ring .",
    "in particular , this yields a uniform recipe for producing explicit cluster structures , many of which were first discovered in this way .",
    "the cluster structure is of finite type when @xmath94 has finite representation type , and in these exceptional cases , the auslander - reiten quiver of @xmath93 is quite helpful for understanding the ensuing combinatorics . finally , this approach allows to show that the cluster monomials of these algebras belong to the dual of lusztig s semicanonical basis .",
    "unfortunately , the relation between the semicanonical and the canonical basis is a subtle question ( see @xcite ) . nevertheless ,",
    "as predicted by the general conjecture of fomin and zelevinsky @xcite , we believe that the cluster monomials also belong to the dual canonical basis , that is , we conjecture that they lie in the intersection of the dual canonical basis and the dual semicanonical basis ( see below  [ sect18 ] ) .",
    "we start with definitions and basic results about preprojective algebras of dynkin type .",
    "let @xmath96 be a dynkin diagram of type @xmath57 , @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
