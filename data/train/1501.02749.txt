    "the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) is the last evolutionary phase of low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath2 m@xmath3 ) , before the brief post - agb phase that leads them to become white dwarfs .",
    "agb stars are characterised by complex nucleosynthesis , high mass - loss rates , and variability .",
    "they are the source of a large fraction of the mass returned by stars to the interstellar medium ( ism , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , they are believed to be the primary ` dust factories ' in galaxies @xcite , even though recent observations have re - evaluated the role played by supernovae ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that understanding mass - loss in agb stars is instrumental for modeling the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the composition of the material returned from agb stars to the ism depends on the chemistry of the star , which is determined by its initial mass and evolutionary history .",
    "the latter is crucially regulated by mass loss .",
    "most stars enter the agb with an intrinsic c / o abundance ratio less than one ( o - rich ) . in stars of @xmath4 m@xmath3 @xcite however , several dredge - up events following thermal pulses may drive the c / o ratio above unity .",
    "these stars become the so - called carbon stars . in stars above @xmath5 m@xmath3 , however , carbon is destroyed by nuclear burning at the base of the convective envelope ( hot bottom burning ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) preventing it from reaching the surface of the star where it could be observed .",
    "these stars never transition to the carbon star phase .",
    "mass limits constraining the formation of carbon stars depend on metallicity ; low metallicity environments ( e.g. the magellanic clouds ) form carbon stars at lower masses .",
    "intrinsic s - type stars share many characteristics with carbon stars such as similar masses and a rich s - element chemistry from many dredge - up events , but they lack sufficient carbon to drive the c / o ratio above one .",
    "stars with masses @xmath6 m@xmath3 do not enter the agb phase , but become red supergiants ( rsgs ) on the way to ending their lives as type  ii supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rsgs do not experience third dredge up episodes and as such they are characterised by an o - rich chemistry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more luminous than agb stars , but with similar spectral types , they are also subject to variability and mass loss .",
    "their dust production rates are comparable to those of agb stars but their overall yield to the ism is lower , due to rsgs being more rare than their lower mass counterparts in the agb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "agb and rsg stars lie close to an instability region of the hertzsprung - russell diagram and as such they exhibit long period variability of mira , semiregular , and irregular type with periods on the order of hundreds to thousands of days .",
    "period - luminosity diagrams of long period variables ( lpvs ) in the magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) reveal sequences that appear to correspond to the variable pulsation mode , binarity and other as yet unknown characteristics @xcite .",
    "these diagrams can be a powerful tool for studying the pulsation mode for a large population of variable stars .",
    "this is especially true when the available light curves are sparse and poorly sampled , making it difficult to detect additional periodicity ( e.g. overtone pulsations ) in the amplitude modulations of the light curve .",
    "the construction of similar diagrams for galactic agb stars would be extremely useful , as they would illuminate the role of metallicity in determining the pulsation properties of these variables .",
    "efforts in this sense depend critically on accurate and precise distance measurements for galactic lpvs @xcite .",
    "pulsations and mass loss are inextricably linked in agb and rsg stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since radial pulsations aide in the formation of the dust - driven winds responsible for the characteristic high mass - loss rates of agb stars ( @xmath7 m@xmath3 yr@xmath8 up to @xmath9 m@xmath3 yr@xmath8 , e.g. @xcite , as compared with @xmath10 m@xmath3 yr@xmath8 to @xmath11 m@xmath3 yr@xmath8 , e.g. @xcite for red giant branch stars ) .",
    "the dusty wind that results from these mass - loss processes , before elements synthesized in agb stars are released into the ism , leads to the formation of dusty cocoons enshrouding the star .",
    "these circumstellar envelopes obscure optical radiation , making observation of mass - losing agb stars difficult at visible wavelengths .",
    "however , thermal radiation from the dust makes agb stars extremely luminous in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite operates in the mid - ir and is an ideal instrument for characterizing agb stars according to their chemical composition , mass - loss rate , and variability class .",

    "agb stars are easily detected by irac and have been found in numerous irac surveys of the milky way ( e.g. glimpse , @xcite ) and local group galaxies ( e.g. sage , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there have been no studies specifically designed to characterise in the irac bands a sample of galactic agb stars with well determined chemical type , variability , and mass - loss rate . to fill this gap",
    ", we designed a program to observe a nearby sample of galactic agb stars with irac in order to better identify agb stars in irac surveys , to facilitate galactic population synthesis studies , and to better understand the chemical evolution of the diffuse matter in the ism .",
    "we have observed 48 galactic agb stars , representing each of the main types of agb stars  o - rich , s - type , carbon stars , mira , semiregular , and irregular variables as well as 6 rsgs of semiregular and irregular variability type .",

    "while our target list is not a statistically significant sample of the galactic agb population , the sample is sufficiently large and diverse to allow a general study of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galactic agb stars in the _ spitzer_/irac bands , and its overall dependence on their chemical , physical , and variability characteristics .",
    "distances for our target stars were derived either from interferometric observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , models of radio emission and/or bolometric luminosity @xcite , and , in the absence of either of those , astrometric methods ( @xcite , adopting the latest corrections of hipparcos distances ) . the distance of our selected agb targets varies from 0.14 to 1.85  kpc ( with one single carbon star that has a distance of 4.21  kpc ) .",
    "the distances to previously observed supergiants have been derived with different methods found in the literature ( see notes on table  [ orig_stars ] ) .",
    "the complete sample is listed in table  [ orig_stars ] , and is divided in three main categories : 22 o - rich agb stars ( m  iii spectral type ) , 7 intrinsic s stars , 19 carbon stars , and 6 supergiants . in each category",
    "we have a similar number of mira , semiregular and irregular variables , with periods ranging from 50 to 822 days .",
    "information about the period and variability type of the targets was obtained from the general catalog of variable stars ( gcvs , * ? ? ?",

    ". the mass - loss rates of our target stars range from @xmath7 to @xmath9  @xmath15  yr@xmath8 in each category .",
    "mass - loss rates for the supergiants were estimated by various methods ( see notes in table  [ orig_stars ] ) . near - ir photometry was obtained ( for random epochs ) from the 2mass catalog @xcite . while higher quality near - ir photometry exists for some of the stars in our sample , we chose to adopt 2mass photometry for uniformity across the sample .",
    "the uncertainty of the 2mass magnitudes are already smaller than the amplitude of the infrared variability of our lpvs . in absence of complete light - curves for all stars in the sample from which to calculate average magnitudes ,",
    "this obviates the need for single epoch photometry with better precision than 2mass .    given the variability of the sources , we requested two epochs ( six months apart , as constrained by the _",

    "while saturated images are not suitable for aperture photometry , reliable photometry can be recovered with point spread function ( psf ) fitting , as long as at least part of the psf is not saturated . to compromise between the need to limit the amount of saturation in our images and , at the same time , fill enough of the irac field - of - view with high s / n unsaturated portions of the psf",
    ", we adopted the 2  sec full - frame irac astronomical observation template . to allow for efficient removal of outliers ( bad pixels and cosmic rays ) , and sufficient spatial sampling of the unsaturated psf optical features ( diffraction spikes and rings )",
    ", we observed each target using the 5-point small scale gaussian dither pattern .",
    "the data were acquired between 2006 june 2 and 2008 june 20 as part of the irac guaranteed time , with pid 30411 . starting with the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) produced by the _",
    "science center ( ssc ) pipeline version s14.4.0 , we generated a mosaiced image for each source , using our own post - bcd software iracproc @xcite .",
    "iracproc is an add - on to ssc s mopex mosaicing software , that applies more sophisticated outlier rejection criteria . with the optimised parameters from iracproc",
    ", mopex defines a fiducial image frame that contains the coordinates for the constituent frames , removes transients using temporal outlier rejection and then interpolates the frames to produce a mosaic image .",
    "the final mosaic is scaled to 0.863@xmath17/pixel which is @xmath18 of the irac pixel scale ( half of the irac native pixel area ) , to provide ideal ( nyquist ) sampling even at the shortest irac wavelengths .",
    "table  [ phot_table ] lists the measured irac vega magnitudes for all sources .",
    "the adopted psf fitting technique , developed specifically for heavily saturated irac images , is described in @xcite . as an example of this procedure , figure",
    "[ fig : photometry_pics ] shows the o - rich agb star cz  ser , shown before and after the psf is fit and subtracted from the target .",
    "we used a high dynamic range image of the irac psf in each band , made from a combination of individual images of a set of stars with different brightness ( sirius , vega , fomalhaut , @xmath19  eridani , @xmath19  indi , and the irac calibrator bd@xmath2068 1022 ) .",
    "the psf intensity is scaled to match the actual irac observations of vega in each band , providing an absolute photometric reference , and is super - sampled over a grid with 0.24@xmath17/pixel . by fitting the unsaturated parts ( diffraction spikes and psf ring and `` tails '' ) of each target star image , we have measured the flux ratio between the stars in our sample and vega .",
    "the typical uncertainty of this procedure is 2@xmath05% ( constrained by comparing the amplitude of the psf subtraction residuals with the background and source photon noise ) , and is comparable to the typical absolute aperture photometry of unsaturated stars with irac .",
    "the photometry of the six supergiants from the literature obtained from @xcite use the same psf - fitting technique .",
    "ground - based mid - ir colors have been used extensively to characterise the physical and chemical properties of the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the irac bands offer a similar opportunity , as they span a wavelength range rich in strong molecular and dust features , and they are free from variable telluric absorption lines .",
    "these features correlate with the chemical signature of the circumstellar environment , dust mineralogy , and abundance in the stellar wind .",
    "note that in the ir , interstellar extinction is dramatically reduced with respect to the visible ; as a consequence the mid - ir and near - ir colors of our sources are mainly determined by photospheric and circumstellar features .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_color ] shows a number of irac color - color diagrams for all target sources .",

    "the largest dispersion is in the [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color ( panel _ a _ ) .",
    "radiative transfer models ( see e.g. @xcite ) show that this sequence is related to increasing amounts of circumstellar dust , indicating larger mass - loss rates ( assuming wind velocities , dust opacities , and a uniform dust - to - gas mass ratio across the sample ) .",
    "we explore quantitatively the correlation between mass - loss rates and irac colors in section  [ s : comparison ] .",
    "stars extending along the infrared excess sequence tend to separate according to their circumstellar chemistry .",
    "o - rich and intrinsic s - type agb stars , as well as the supergiants , tend to have a redder [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color ( for the same [ 3.6]@xmath0[4.5 ] color ) , due to the presence of silicate features dramatically increasing their flux in the 8.0  band .",
    "this separation is only effective for sources with moderate infrared excess , e.g. @xmath21 - [ 8.0 ] \\ga 1 $ ] mag .",
    "the @xcite models we selected miss the location of the most extreme o - rich agb stars in all of the color - color diagrams .",
    "this may be due to the choice of dust chemistry in the model . in figure",
    "[ fig : all_color ] , we plot models using a mixed chemistry  60% aluminum oxide ( amorphous porous al@xmath12o@xmath1 ) and 40% silicates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "more recent papers have shown that the choice of optical constants affects the predicted flux of the silicate feature near 10  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the particular silicate opacities employed in the model may lead to the inaccurate determination of the dust mass - loss rate .",
    "plots including colors with the 5.8  band ( panels _ b _ and _ d _ ) instead show an unexpected separation of carbon stars into two distinct branches .",
    "both branches show similar [ 5.8]@xmath0[8.0 ] excess , but the upper branch continues to get progressively redder in both [ 4.5]@xmath0[5.8 ] and [ 3.6]@xmath0[4.5 ] colors , whereas stars in the lower branch tend to get bluer in the [ 4.5]@xmath0[5.8 ] color .",

    "looking at just the carbon stars in [ 5.8]@xmath0[8.0 ] versus [ 4.5]@xmath0[5.8 ] color and using different symbols to indicate increasing mass - loss rate ( figure  [ fig : carbon_color ] ) , we see that the separation is related to the mass - loss rate listed in table  [ orig_stars ]",
    ". stars with higher mass - loss rates are on the upper , red branch , while stars with lower mass - loss rates populate the lower , blue track .",

    "we have also compared our colors with the synthetic photometry of 122 agb and rsg stars of different chemical type , derived by @xcite by convolving available iso / sws spectra with the irac passbands . some of these sources have been observed by iso at multiple epochs allowing a direct test of the effect of variable spectral features on the irac colors .",
    "representative examples are shown in figure  [ fig : all_isosws ] . the spectrum of carbon stars along the blue branch ( e.g. vx  and in the top panel ) exhibits a strong c@xmath1 absorption feature centred at 5  .",
    "this feature is not present in the spectra of stars in the redder branch ( e.g. v  crb and t  ind ) .",
    "based on @xcite , c@xmath1 is assumed to be developing in the atmospheres of dust poor carbon stars .",
    "this feature disappears in stars with thicker circumstellar envelopes , either because it is filled by the continuum dust emission , or because the molecule making the feature is depleted . as noted in @xcite , this feature appears to be transient , as some sources observed with iso sws in multiple epochs do not show it in all spectra .",
    "this suggests that the feature variability is related to changes in the c@xmath1 abundances in the stellar atmosphere as the star pulsates , rather than changes in the dust content of the circumstellar envelope ( which is unlikely to show large scale variations on the short time - scales of the iso repeated observations , although such variations are found on longer time - scales , see",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra of carbon stars present several other molecular features in the irac passbands ( co , c@xmath12h@xmath12 , hcn and cs ) .",
    "c@xmath12h@xmath12 falls mostly outside the 3.6  band , and does not contribute significantly to the [ 3.6]@xmath0[4.5 ] color of the carbon stars .",
    "co absorption in the 4.5  band more likely contributes to the negative ( as low as @xmath23 mag ) [ 3.6]@xmath0[4.5 ] color of the carbon stars with low overall infrared excess .",
    "all these molecular absorption features are filled by dust continuum emission for the redder sources , explaining the general trend of increasing [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color for stars with larger circumstellar dust content .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of the o - rich sources ( middle panel ) , intrinsic s - stars and a red supergiant ( bottom panel ) are also rich in several molecular features ( including co , h@xmath12o , sio , co@xmath12 and so@xmath12 ) . of these , the features that have the largest effect on the irac colors are sio , co@xmath12 , and co bands that can severely depress the 4.5  flux leading to blue [ 3.6]@xmath0[4.5 ] colors ( as low as @xmath24 mag ) for the sources with less overall infrared excess .",
    "sources with high dust content show the prominent 10  silicate feature in emission .",
    "as mentioned before , this feature is partially captured by the 8.0  band , causing the [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color to be redder for higher mass - loss rates .",
    "there are no significant differences between the colors of the individual types of o - rich sources , as evidenced by the fact that m - type agb stars , intrinsic s - stars and red supergiants all trace the same color sequence .",
    "a number of classification schemes for the chemistry of agb stars rely on the combination of irac with near - ir colors .",
    "figures  7 and 8 in @xcite , for example , show how o- and c - rich sources in the smc and lmc segregate according to their j@xmath0[8.0 ] color . with this scheme ,",
    "o - rich agb stars have @xmath25 \\la 1.4 $ ] mag and c - rich agb stars have @xmath25 \\ga 1.9 $ ] mag , with the so - called `` anomalous '' o - rich population having intermediate color .",
    "we do not see this segregation for galactic agb stars , as shown in our figure  [ fig : j-8.0 ] , where c - rich and o - rich agb stars overlap above @xmath25 > 2 $ ] mag and intrinsic s - type stars ( proposed as one possible explanation for the lmc / smc anomalous o - rich agb class ) overlap with the range of the anomalous o - rich agb stars ( see box in figure  [ fig : j-8.0 ] ) .",
    "the fact that we have several o - rich agb stars that have significantly redder colors than most o - rich agb stars in the magellanic clouds may be the consequence of the different evolutionary paths of the two agb populations in galaxies with different metallicity .",
    "agb stars are observed to have redder colours at higher metallicities because the gas to dust ratio increases @xcite .",
    "we note that the few o - rich agb stars in the magellanic clouds that have redder colours than the galactic agb stars in our sample are oh / ir stars @xcite . as noticed by many authors ( see , e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a low metallicity environment favors the creation of carbon stars early in the evolution of an agb star , when the mass - loss rate ( and hence infrared excess ) tends to be smaller . according to this hypothesis ,",
    "lmc / smc o - rich agb stars are restricted to low j@xmath0[8.0 ] excess , with only c - rich stars having redder j@xmath0[8.0 ] colors due to their greater mass loss .",
    "this restriction would not be present in galactic o - rich agb stars , requiring a higher number of thermal pulses to transition to c - rich chemistry . alternatively (",
    "though not in our sample ) , the neat color separation observed in the lmc / smc c- and o - rich agb stars could be explained by the selection method used to identify the chemical type of the source .",
    "lmc / smc agb catalogs are typically based on near - ir colors ( see e.g. figure  5 in @xcite ) while the chemistry of our targets has been identified spectroscopically .",
    "this second possibility is supported by the large range in infrared colors exhibited by spectroscopically identified c- and o - rich lmc agb stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , this may be a selection bias in our sample as we have selected sources with measurable mass - loss rates , and hence a larger infrared excess .",
    "the two reddest o - rich agb stars in our sample are ku  and and v1300  aql .",
    "both have red [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color and v1300  aql is the reddest in the near - ir ( consistent with its fainter j - band magnitude indicative of higher circumstellar extinction , see table  [ orig_stars ] ) .",
    "several ( 5 ) of our o - rich agb stars have [ 5.8]@xmath0[8.0 ] vs. [ 3.6]@xmath0[4.5 ] color sufficiently red that they would be considered _",
    "extreme _ agb stars by @xcite .",
    "in fact , all of our o - rich agb stars are redder than the @xmath26 color cut @xcite use to isolate o - rich agb stars in the lmc ( see figure  [ fig : j - k ] ) .    to test whether the redder colors of our o - rich agb stars are representative of the galactic agb population , or rather are the consequence of selection effects , we extracted the 2mass photometry of all mira and semiregular variables in the gcvs @xcite with known chemical type .",
    "the median @xmath26 color ( 0.85 mag ) of this larger sample of o - rich agb stars falls within the @xcite color cut , suggesting that the red colors of the o - rich agb stars reflect our choice of o - rich agb stars with measured mass - loss rates , and thus greater ir excess ( see figure  [ fig : gcvs_j - k ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a large fraction of the gcvs carbon stars have a @xmath26 color falling outside the boundaries of the @xcite c - rich color cut .",
    "@xcite also find that carbon stars are less red at similar metallicities in m33 .",

    "* for k@xmath28 mag , see figure  [ fig : j - k ] ) . based on this , the majority of c - rich sources would likely be misclassified as o - rich sources .",
    "however , sources in the gcvs tend to be optically selected , and as such are biased toward low circumstellar extinction ( small mass - loss rates ) , and may sample less - evolved , non - dusty agb stars that behave very differently than their more evolved , dustier counterparts @xcite .",

    "as expected , the irac bands are affected by the variability of the sources to a much smaller extent than the optical bands ( where mira light - curves can have amplitudes as large as 11 mag , @xcite ) , with smaller variations for longer wavelengths .",
    "the smallest changes are observed for sources that are classified as semiregular or irregular variables ( 0.14 , 0.12 , 0.11 , and 0.10 mag in each band ) , as expected because of their shorter periods and smaller pulsation amplitudes with respect to miras ( 0.46 , 0.45 , 0.42 , and 0.41 mag respectively ) .",

    "the sources classified in the gcvs @xcite as mira and semiregulars are indicated by different symbols .",
    "the size of the symbols is proportional to the [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color ( as a proxy for their mass - loss rate ) .",
    "the shaded bands for the individual sequences are derived from the approximate distribution of lmc lpvs in @xcite where the [ 3.6 ] magnitude is taken as a proxy for the luminosity , and converted to absolute magnitudes using the lmc distance modulus of 18.5 @xcite .",
    "these sequences are similar to those found by @xcite using the @xmath13 band magnitude as a proxy for luminosity , however they have a slightly shallower slope ( larger period for a given luminosity ) .    the location of our sources on the diagram is listed in table  [ tab : pl ] and is largely as expected , based on agb stars in the magellanic clouds , confirming results found by @xcite using synthetic irac photometry from @xcite .",
    "miras ( squares ) are all within or below the sequence _ c _ ( fundamental pulsators ) , with the exception of the carbon star r  for , which is in the first overtone sequence _",
    "c_. a few of the miras appear to be significantly under - luminous in the 3.6   band , up to 3 mag below the _ c _ sequence for their period , placing them in or near the secondary long period sequence _",
    "d_. most of these stars ( e.g. ku  and and v1300  aql ) have large infrared excess due to their high mass - loss rate ; their low 3.6   brightness may be caused by the large extinction due to their thick circumstellar envelope .",
    "alternately , they may have increased their period as the stellar structure responds to the mass lost .",
    "the semiregular variables , as expected , are mostly located in the overtone sequences or the lower part of sequence _",
    "c_. only four semiregulars ( t  ind , vx  and , bn  mon and rs  cyg , all carbon stars ) are found in the area of the _ c _ sequence occupied by fundamental mode miras .",
    "et  vir is the faintest source in the plot , lying at the very bottom of sequence _",
    "c_. at a hipparcos - determined distance of 0.14 kpc , et  vir is also the nearest source in the sample . given the large uncertainty on the parallax ( @xmath35% ) , we might expect that the luminosity has been underestimated due to an unreliable distance estimate .",
    "however , the hipparcos value agrees well with the distance modulus calculated using the width of chromospheric ca  ii emission lines @xcite to determine the absolute magnitude , making it unclear why et  vir is more than a magnitude fainter than the other sources in the sample .",
    "one possibility is that we observed et  vir with lower luminosity following a thermal pulse .",
    "all semiregular agb variables in our sample tend to have small infrared excess , so it is unlikely that their position in the diagram is significantly affected by extinction at 3.6  .",
    "the only semiregular variables with large excess are four supergiants ( xx  per , w  per , nml  cyg , and vx  sgr ) , located at the top of sequence _",
    "c _ as expected .    the general distribution of our galactic lpvs in the period - luminosity diagram is characterised by a significantly larger spread than the variables in the magellanic clouds",
    "as found by previous authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this is primarily due to the larger uncertainty in the distance of galactic lpvs , and possibly in the larger spread in their metal abundance , which also affects their period - luminosity relation . despite these difficulties , the period - luminosity plot using",
    "the irac 3.6   band ( where extinction is minimal , and infrared excess tends to be lower than at longer wavelengths ) as a proxy for luminosity remains an important tool to study the pulsation mode of these variables , most of which only possess sparse and incomplete light - curves .    while period - magnitude relations are diagnostics of the pulsation mechanisms of several classes of variables , the infrared colors of agb stars are dominated by dust emission and molecular absorption .",
    "the relationship between infrared colors and period , however , provides an excellent diagnostic to investigate the dependence of the circumstellar chemistry and mass - loss rate on the pulsation period .",
    "the [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color , which is strongly affected by dust emission , is a good candidate for this analysis .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : period_color ] .",
    "semiregular variables are distributed along a tight ( rms @xmath36 mag ) period - color relation , statistically consistent with a zero slope , confined within a narrow color range ( @xmath37[3.6]@xmath0[8.0]@xmath38 mag ) .",
    "note that all semiregulars , including the ones with larger period that appear to be on the fundamental mode sequence _ c _ , are part of the same period - color relation .",
    "the mira variables are instead spread over a much larger range of colors ( @xmath37[3.6]@xmath0[8.0]@xmath39 mag ) , with longer period sources ( on the _ d _ sequence ) having the largest infrared excess .",
    "the two linear best - fitting relations are :    @xmath40-[8.0 ] = ( -0.11 \\pm 0.10 ) + ( 0.17 \\pm 0.05 ) \\log(p ) \\right . \\\\",

    "\\mathrm{rms}=0.42 \\ : \\mathrm{mag } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where the period is in days .",
    "one possible explanation for this dichotomy is that the two groups of variables are characterised by different dust composition , affecting their excess in the irac bands .",
    "one problem with this interpretation is that there seems to be no difference between o - rich ( m and s - type ) and c - rich agb stars , despite the very different source of the infrared excess ( mainly continuum from amorphous carbon dust for carbon stars , and the 10  silicate feature in emission for m and s - type agb stars ) .",
    "another possibility is a difference in the amount of circumstellar dust responsible for the ir excess , i.e. a different mass - loss rate .",
    "while the median mass - loss rate of the miras in our sample is indeed higher than for the semiregulars ( @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xmath44  yr@xmath8 respectively ) , the separation is not as marked as in the color - period space .",
    "a third possibility is that the separation in color reflects different circumstellar dust temperatures . given that the irac bands are sensitive to dust in the temperature range @xmath45 k , the observed dichotomy may indicate that semiregulars are deficient in the hot dust emission that is present in mira variables .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion in @xcite that semiregular variables could have discontinuous mass - loss , spending a significant part of their time in the quiescent phase with only brief phases of higher mass - loss . according to this hypothesis",
    ", semiregulars would have more excess during these brief intervals of higher mass - loss , but once this phase has concluded , the dust would expand and cool , leading to a small [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] excess ( @xmath46 mag ) . infrared color variations due to intermittent dust production",
    "have been found for many agb stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , for both mira and semiregular lpvs .",
    "those variations have been attributed to the emission of dust clumps , similar to the ones observed with interferometric observations of the very obscured mira carbon star irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "the different color we observe between mira and sr variables may reflect the fact that dust episodes in semiregulars happen on longer time - scales , giving the dust time to cool between each mass - loss episode .",
    "less excess for the semiregulars would mean that their irac colors are a better reflection of the star s intrinsic color ( and not thermal emission from the dust ) .",
    "this would lead to the more strict period - color relation for semiregular than for mira variables .",
    "indeed it is the higher excess in mira variables that would prevent a similarly tight relation .",
    "the intense mass - loss processes that are often active during the agb phase are not well understood .",
    "commonly used empirical mass - loss - rate formulas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) only provide an order - of - magnitude estimate of the mass - loss rate of agb stars and can not predict the actual mass - loss rate as a function of stellar parameters .",
    "radiative transfer modeling can be used to infer the amount of circumstellar dust from excess flux measurements in the thermal infrared .",
    "coupled with assumptions about the agb wind velocity ( usually @xmath47 km s@xmath8 ) and the gas - to - dust mass ratio ( typically in the range of the ism ratio of @xmath48 ) , these models can be used to provide estimates for agb mass - loss rates from infrared photometric measurements .",
    "this can be achieved either by fitting the sed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of each source to a model or adopting a color  mass - loss relation ( see e.g. models using realistic stellar atmospheres from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models show how high - mass - loss rate agb stars of all types follow monotonically increasing sequences similar to those shown in figure  [ fig : all_color ] ( higher mass - loss rate , stronger infrared excess ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_matsuura ] shows the mass - loss rate plotted as function of [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color . reflecting the color separation found in figure  [ fig : period_color ] ,",
    "all semiregular variables are grouped in the @xmath49 mag color range . however , the overall mass - loss rates are comparable for the two groups .",
    "this is in accordance with the previously mentioned results found in marengo et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see discussion in section  [ s : mag_col_per ] ) , and since we would expect semiregular variables to show less excess than mira variables if they are characterised by discontinuous mass - loss .",
    "the overlap in the distribution of agb stars of different chemical types echoes our finding that the majority of o - rich agb stars in our sample have colors consistent with carbon stars ( see section  [ s : colors ] ) . because our sample of o - rich agb stars is biased towards higher mass - loss rates , the most significant contributors of o - rich agb dust are also the most likely to be mis - classified with color cuts alone , suggesting that care must be taken in inferring the chemical yield of agb dust from color - selected stellar population studies .    selecting for agb stars with measured mass - loss rates may also explain the relatively high mass - loss rate that is characteristic of our sample .",
    "our best - fit for the mass - loss rate as a function of [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color for the o - rich agb ( excluding the supergiants ) and c - rich agb samples respectively , are : @xmath50 - [ 8.0 ] ) + 3.65 ] - 1.45 \\\\ \\mathrm{o - rich : }   \\\\",
    "\\log(\\mathrm{dm / dt } ) = -9.65 / [ ( [ 3.6 ] - [ 8.0 ] ) + 1.35 ] - 2.29 \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] while the small number of sources in either sample does not allow us to establish meaningful uncertainties to the fits , we note that the two curves approach each other for @xmath21-[8.0 ] \\ga 2 $ ] mag .",
    "this suggests that the mass - loss rate for red sources is similar , for a given value of the infrared excess , regardless of the dust chemistry .",
    "our three supergiants with reliable mass - loss rate estimates follow a trend similar to the agb stars , but as expected are shifted towards higher mass - loss rates .",
    "similar fits are provided by different authors for agb stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_matsuura ] shows a selection of them @xcite , based on the photometry obtained as part of the _ spitzer_/irac sage program .",
    "it is worth noting that the spread between the individual fits is large , as much as an order of magnitude in @xmath51 .",
    "this spread may be , in part , a consequence of the specific selection criteria adopted by different authors , leading to different biases in the agb samples used in the fit .",
    "different assumptions for the gas - to - dust ratio and wind velocity , as well as different optical constants used to model the sources will also contribute to the spread .",
    "while our best - fitting relations predict larger mass - loss rates for our galactic agb sample , the large uncertainty in the fit parameters and the spread between the magellanic cloud curves prevent us from deriving meaningful conclusions about the dependence of mass - loss rates on metallicity .",
    "such a dependence is expected for o - rich agb stars , but not for c - rich sources , since carbon is synthesized locally in the thermally - pulsing agb stars , as argued by @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the local synthesis of carbon increases the dust - to - gas ratio ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a large galactic sample with reliable distances ( that could be provided in the near future by gaia ) and radio - based mass - loss rate determinations will help resolve this issue .    the selection criteria used by @xcite to differentiate evolved stars in the magellanic clouds result in a sample that is more directly comparable with our own galactic sample . the sources in these works",
    "are identified by optical and infrared spectroscopy , avoiding the potential mis - classification of red o - rich sources ( oh / ir stars and rsg ) in the extreme agb class ( where most of the sources , at least in the magellanic clouds , are c - rich ) .",
    "@xcite show how spectrally classified sources of different type tend to separate into three different regions in the [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] versus [ 8.0 ] color - magnitude diagram .",
    "these three regions are overlaid on our sample in figure  [ fig : color_mag ] .",
    "note that for our galactic sources , the bright supergiants also have the highest mass - loss rate plotted in figure  [ fig : comp_matsuura ] .",
    "our two o - rich agb stars with larger infrared excess are in the lowest luminosity region in the @xcite diagram , within the region where extreme c - rich agb stars are expected .",
    "however , these two stars are characterised by a mass - loss rate as high as c - rich agb stars with similar excess . as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the overall dust return of agb stars to the ism of the magellanic clouds",
    "is dominated by a handful of stars with very large mass - loss rates . in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "most of these stars tend to be c - rich ` extreme ' stars",
    ". the situation may be different in the galaxy where a large number of very red oh / ir stars are found .",
    "these o - rich evolved stars , with mass - loss rates as high as the two reddest o - rich agb stars in our sample , may contribute as much as the c - rich agb stars to the overall dust budget in our galaxy . a larger portion of o - rich agb stars with high mass - loss rates in sources with near solar metallicity has indeed been observed in m33 @xcite .",
    "we present the results of the first study to characterise galactic agb stars in the irac bands .",
    "the sample consists of 48 agb stars observed in two epochs  22 o - rich , 19 carbon - rich , and 7 s - type  representing a diverse agb population with well - determined distance , chemistry , variability type , and mass - loss rate .",
    "these are compared to 6 supergiants representing mass - losing evolved stars outside the agb .    by fitting a psf to unsaturated parts of the irac images ,",
    "we derive reliable photometry in all four irac bands . from this , we compute the mid - ir colors of galactic agb stars .",
    "agb stars with o - rich chemistry ( including s - type agb stars ) tend to have redder [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] colors than carbon stars for a given [ 3.6]@xmath0[4.5 ] color , possibly driven by silicate emission in the [ 8.0 ] band . for colors including the 5.8  band , carbon stars separate into two distinct sequences .",
    "carbon stars with higher mass - loss rates tend to lie along the redder branch , while sources along the blue branch have lower mass - loss rates .",
    "we interpret this as evidence of a photospheric c@xmath1 feature that is only visible in the low - mass - loss - rate sources that are relatively unobscured by dusty circumstellar envelopes .",
    "agb stars are lpvs , so we have examined both the color and the magnitude as a function of period .",
    "we find a period - color relationship consistent with the hypothesis of @xcite that semiregular variables lose mass discontinuously , leading to a lack of hot dust producing redder colors .",
    "in contrast , the mira variables extend along a more linear sequence toward redder colors as we might expect based on the fact that their mass - loss rates are more sustained in time .",
    "the period - luminosity distribution of galactic agb stars is similar to that found by @xcite for the lmc .",
    "mira variables fall along the fundamental pulsation sequence _",
    "c_. semiregular variables are mostly in sequences _ a _ and _ b _ , reflecting the presence of higher overtone modes and shorter periods .",
    "we derive a relationship between mass - loss rate and [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color separately for o - rich agb stars and carbon stars .",
    "the overall shape of the fits is similar to those found by other authors for agb stars in the lmc , albeit corresponding to a higher mass - loss rate for a given [ 3.6]@xmath0[8.0 ] color .",
    "discrepancies between our fits and those found by other authors likely reflect different assumptions used in the radiative transfer models used to derive mass - loss rates and uncertainties in the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "in addition , we find that neither color nor mass - loss rate is a good discriminator of chemical type , suggesting that care must be taken when inferring the chemical contribution of dust returned to the ism by agb stars .",
