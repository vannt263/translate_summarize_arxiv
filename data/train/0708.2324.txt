    "in the present note we investigate rotating black holes and other generally relativistic spacetimes where rotation of matter might induce closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) , thus allowing for a `` time traveler '' who might take advantage of this spacetime structure .",
    "most prominently , we will discuss kerr - newman black holes in which a rotating charged ring - shaped singularity induces a region which contains ctcs . due to the electric charge of the singularity , this region is not confined to within the analytic extension `` beyond the singular ring '' , but extends into the side of the ring - singularity facing the asymptotically flat region , from whence the daring time traveler presumably embarks upon her journey .",
    "interestingly , some kind of `` counter - rotational phenomenon '' occurs here .",
    "if a potential time traveler wants to use our kerr - newman black hole for traveling into her past , she will have to orbit along the ctc in the direction opposite to that of the rotation of the black hole . in technical words ,",
    "the time orientation of the ctc is opposite to the direction in which the singularity or the ergosphere rotates .",
    "this state of affairs is at odds with the qualitative , intuitive explanations for the mechanism creating ctcs presented in most popular books .",
    "this will motivate the questions formulated in section  [ expl - sec ] .. ] we have similar results for all spacetimes sufficiently familiar to us in which rotation induces ctcs .",
    "this motivates our conjecture that perhaps this counter - rotation is not an accidental oddity particular to kerr - newman spacetimes , but instead there may be a general and intuitively comprehensible reason for this .",
    "understanding what we take to be the most promising candidate mechanism to produce ctcs in an otherwise causally well - behaved spacetime , i.e.  the counter - rotational phenomenon mentioned above , is of paramount importance in evaluating the causal stability of generally relativistic spacetimes . since one possibility to violate hawking s chronology protection conjecture or ,",
    "more generally , the strong form of penrose s cosmic censorship conjecture is through the emergence of acausal features via such a mechanism @xcite , the present paper contributes to efforts directed at the larger projects of understanding chronology protection and cosmic censorship in general relativity .",
    "furthermore , the issues discussed here are also motivated by discussions in our works @xcite and @xcite . in those papers it turned out that studying the geometry of rotating black holes can be relevant to some far - reaching considerations in the foundation of mathematics and logic . the counter - rotational phenomenon in kerr - newman spacetime",
    "was already noted explicitly in @xcite , albeit without further analysis .",
    "a fascinating book providing a broad perspective for the presently discussed matters is earman  @xcite .",

    "we will be interested in the",
    " innermost \" region of the black hole , defined by @xmath30 , which is where the ctcs ( i.e.  closed timelike curves ) are .",
    "this part of the spacetime is called _ block iii _ or _ negative exterior kerr spacetime ( ekn@xmath31)_. the so - called  equatorial plane \" is defined by @xmath12 .",
    "this plane contains , in block iii , the so - called ring - singularity @xmath32 for the kerr case , i.e.  for an _ uncharged _ rotating black hole , the ctcs transpire inside and close to this ring - singularity , i.e.  ctcs are found in regions where @xmath4 is negative but has small absolute value .",
    "this part of the spacetime belongs to what @xcite calls the _",
    "time machine_. on the other hand , the part outside the ring - singularity and sufficiently close to it belongs to the so - called `` ergosphere . ''",
    "the _ ergosphere _ ( in block iii ) is defined to be the place where the vectors @xmath33 parallel to the  time - axis \" are not timelike but spacelike .",
    "an ergosphere , thus , is a region of spacetime where no observer can remain still with respect to the coordinate system in question . for static black holes , such as those described by schwarzschild spacetime ,",
    "the outer limit of the ergosphere coincides with the black hole s event horizon .",
    "this is no longer the case when the black holes revolve .",
    "then , the faster the black hole rotates , the more the ergosphere grows beyond the outer horizon @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35-surfaces close to the equatorial plane , i.e.  the surfaces with fixed @xmath36 and fixed small @xmath37 , look similar , except that they contain no singularity ( if @xmath38 ) .    all our investigations below are strongly connected to the _ time - orientation _ of the spacetime being discussed .",

    "assume that the lifeline of a particle @xmath40 is given by the well - parameterized , future - pointing curve @xmath41 with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an interval of the reals .",
    "we say that @xmath40 is _ rotating in the direction @xmath44 _ ( at @xmath45 ) if with increasing proper time @xmath46 the values of the @xmath47-component are increasing ( at @xmath48 ) , i.e.  if @xmath49 is positive ( at @xmath48 ) .",
    "sloppily , we could write this as  @xmath50 \" on @xmath40 ( at @xmath48 ) .",
    "we say that the direction of rotation of @xmath40 ( at @xmath48 ) is @xmath51 if the latter value is negative .",
    "it is known that any particle in the ergosphere must rotate in the @xmath44 direction , it is not possible to avoid rotating or to rotate in the @xmath51 direction in the ergosphere ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.4.4 ) ) .",
    "the reason is that in the ergosphere the light cones are tilted in the @xmath47 direction , i.e.  the light cones in the @xmath52-cylinders look like those in the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : light2 ] .",
    "the situation is drastically different in the `` time machine '' region !",

    "we mean that a traveler in the ergosphere and a traveler moving forward in time in the time machine but just preparing for entering a ctc , i.e.  with @xmath56 approaching ( @xmath57 , move in opposite directions .",
    "the one in the ergosphere co - moves with the singularity ( or the source ) while the one on the ctc , or almost on the ctc , moves in the opposite direction .",
    "this results from considering the singularity as the source of the field and the assumption that it rotates in the positive @xmath47 direction because the total angular momentum @xmath58 of the kerr spacetime with @xmath59 is positive .",
    "this is just what we dub a _",
    "counter - rotating effect _ : the property that the ctcs counter - rotate with the ring - singularity ( and with the ergosphere ) in the sense just described .",
    "in other words , the time - orientations of the ctcs point in the @xmath60 direction while the ergosphere rotates in the opposite , @xmath61 direction .",
    "we note that this counter - rotational effect remains valid if we extend our attention beyond the equatorial plane defined by @xmath12 .",
    "we also note that this counter - rotational effect does not depend on which of the two possible time - orientations we choose .",
    "we can formulate this counter - rotational effect in a coordinate - independent way by saying that where the ( invariantly defined ) killing vector field @xmath62 is timelike , its time - orientation is negative ( and hence a would - be time traveler must orbit in the @xmath60 direction ) .",
    "here we assume that the time - orientation is chosen such that the rotation of the source points in the positive @xmath47 direction .",
    "( we note that our claim that the ctcs and the ergosphere rotate in the opposite directions can also be formulated in a coordinate - independent way . )",
    "at this point one might be tempted to think that perhaps the cause of the above counter - rotational phenomenon might be found in the fact that the co - rotating area ( ergosphere ) and the counter - rotating area ( time machine ) are separated by the ring - singularity .",
    "so perhaps the counter - rotation can be explained by saying that the ring - singularity acts like a mirror turning directions into their negatives .",
    "such a symmetry about the ring - singularity would still not account for the rotational sense of the ring - singularity itself ; in particular it would keep us wondering why the singularity co - rotates with the ergosphere but counter - rotates with the ctcs .",
    "the simplest way of seeing that such mirroring about the singular region can not possibly give a hint for the diametric revolutions of the ergosphere and the time machine is by looking at kerr - newman spacetimes where the co - rotational and counter - rotational areas are no longer separated by the ring - singularity .",
    "hypersurfaces with fixed , small values of @xmath11 .",
    "in such a hypersurface the co - rotating and counter - rotating regions still exist but they are no longer separated by a singularity . ]",
    "kerr - newman spacetimes describe black holes with angular momentum as in the kerr case , but with an electric charge in addition .",
    "we are using the definition of kerr - newman spacetime as given e.g.  in misner - thorne - wheeler  ( * ? ? ? * , e.g.  item ( 33.2 ) on p.  877 ) , wald  ( * ? ? ? * , item ( 12.3.1 ) ) , dinverno  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the kerr - newman metric can be obtained from the kerr metric ( in boyer - lindquist coordinates ) by simply replacing all occurrences of @xmath63 with @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the electric charge of the black hole .",
    "thus , the metric will take on the form    @xmath66 , where @xmath17 ,    @xmath18 , where @xmath67 ,    @xmath20 ,    @xmath68/\\rho^2)\\sin^2\\theta$ ] ,    @xmath69 and all the other @xmath23 s are zero .",
    "the vector field @xmath70 as defined in section [ kerr - sec ] is an admissible time - orientation for block iii of the kerr - newman spacetime , too .",
    "as the focus of the present article is precisely on block iii , this reassurance suffices for our purposes . the counter - rotating phenomenon described in the previous section holds in the case of charged kerr - newman holes , too .",
    "however , this counter - rotation effect is more poignant than in the kerr case , for the following reason . in the kerr - newman spacetime",
    "there are ctcs both at small positive values of @xmath4 ( say , at @xmath71 ) and also at small negative values of @xmath4 ( say , at @xmath72 ) in the equatorial plane .",

    "let us further assume that this vantage point is situated on the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "the kerr - newman spacetime is asymptotically flat .",
    "thus , at this distant point , the black hole does not influence the light cones significantly and we can safely assume that they are straight or  vertical \" like in minkowski spacetime .",
    "let us then move slowly towards the black hole .",
    "as it gets closer , the so - called dragging of inertial frames caused by the rotation of the black hole comes into action .",
    "this dragging effect is explained in relativity textbooks via mach s principle , e.g.  @xcite or @xcite .",
    "so as an influence of the rotation of our massive ring ( the singularity ) , the light cones get tilted in the direction @xmath47 of the rotation of the ring .",
    "naturally , the closer we get to the rotating ring , the stronger this dragging effect , and thus the tilting , will be .",
    "the standard account goes on by saying that eventually the light cones tip over completely ( i.e.  they dip below the equatorial plane ) , so they become approximately  horizontal , \" making @xmath44 timelike ( and @xmath33 spacelike ) .",
    "this clearly leads to ctcs by @xmath44 being timelike .",
    "this literature thus creates the false impression that the proper time of the ctcs _ co - rotates _ , rather than _",
    "counter - rotates _",
    ", with the matter content of the universe . the time orientation of the ctcs ,",
    "according to this `` official story , '' therefore agrees with the direction of rotation of the source of the field .",
    "it is important to stress that according to this official story the time orientation of the so obtained ctcs agrees with the direction @xmath47 of rotation of the black hole ",
    "contrary to what has been established in sections [ kerr - sec ] and [ kn - sec ] .",
    "hence a time traveler using such ctcs would orbit in the positive @xmath47 direction , i.e.  would rotate in the same direction as the black hole does .",
    "if this explanation worked , it would yield an intuitively convincing , natural explanation for why and how the basic principles of general relativity lead in certain situations ( such as when appropriately distributed rotating masses are present ) to ctcs .",
    "one of our main points is that the above explanation does not work , simply because light cones behave differently in the relevant spacetimes , as is also illustrated in figure  [ series - fig ] .",
    "let us see how the corrected story goes based on detailed computations in kerr - newman spacetime .",
    "these computations will be presented in section  [ app - sec ] .",
    "first of all , we emphasize that the new , corrected story suggested in the present paper does not offer any kind of _ explanation _ for the creation of ctcs .",
    "instead , it merely offers a description of the behavior of the light cones .",
    "we maintain , however , that a proper understanding of this behavior , and particularly the counter - rotation that we are interested in , at least constitutes an important and promising first step toward such an explanation . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the charge and rotation of the black hole are sufficient for ensuring that there are ctcs at positive values of the radius @xmath4 , i.e.outside the ring - singularity .",
    "surely enough , the corrected story begins exactly like the official party line : distant light cones are erect , i.e.  vertical and they start to tilt in the @xmath47 direction as we begin moving towards the black hole . but this tilting effect does not grow beyond any limit as we move towards the ring - singularity . as we move inward ( towards the ring ) , the tilting grows for a while but then it stops growing , and eventually at a radius @xmath80 safely outside the time - travel region , the light cone ( in the @xmath81-plane ) is erect again . from @xmath80 inward , the tilting is in the other direction , i.e.  in the @xmath82 direction .",
    "( until now , i.e.  at values greater than @xmath80 , the tilting was always in the @xmath83 direction . )",
    "thus , tilting in the @xmath47 direction did not result in ctcs , because @xmath80 is safely outside the time - travel region .",
    "moreover , tilting alone in the @xmath82 direction does not lead to ctcs , either , because from @xmath80 inward , the time - axis is always inside the light cone ( i.e.@xmath33 is always timelike ) .",
    "so what happens if we go closer and closer to the ring - singularity ?",
    "in other words , what creates the ctcs if not the cone tipping ?",
    "the answer is that , eventually , the _ light cones open up _ in the negative @xmath47 direction .",
    "this second effect is carried to such an extreme that @xmath51 becomes contained in the future light cone , for sufficiently small but positive values of the radius @xmath4 .",
    "if we are close enough to the ring - singularity , then time travel becomes possible  but only if we orbit in the negative @xmath47 direction .",
    "hence the time traveler has to orbit in the direction opposite to the rotation of the black hole .",
    "it is this fact that we refer to as the phenomenon of counter - rotating .",
    "let us summarize the new story s two most important features .",
    "these are :    \\(i ) counter - rotation ( i.e.  the time orientation of the ctcs is @xmath51 ) , and    \\(ii ) it is not the tilting of the light cones due to the dragging of inertial frames which leads to the formation of ctcs , but a second effect , primarily resulting in their opening up in the negative @xmath47 direction .",
    "the open issue we would like to raise is the following .",
    "the official story as presented at the beginning of this section provided an intuitive physical account as to what causes the tipping of the light cones . to repeat ,",
    "our computations show that this official story is not true and that it has to be replaced with the new story outlined above .",
    "unfortunately , however , we can not offer an equally intuitive and suggestive explanation for the new story .",
    "hence , we would like to issue a challenge to our readers in form of the following question :    * question 1 .",
    "* is there a qualitative  and similarly compelling  explanation as to why the time traveler has to  counter - rotate \" against the rotating ring - singularity in kerr - newman spacetime ? can one find a physical mechanism which qualitatively explains why and how ctcs are  created \" by rotation of matter ?    in the above description of the  new story \" we concentrated on kerr - newman black holes for simplicity .",
    "the situation is similar in many spacetimes where rotation of relatively large masses leads to the formation of ctcs .",
    "for example , our corrected story applies equally to kerr black holes , with appropriate modifications to adapt the train of thought to the fact that in the kerr case the ctcs only transpire in the negative radius region . with @xmath84 which , however , must be sufficiently small for intersecting the causality violating region . this slight change of itinerary does not alter in principle the counter - rotational effect we discussed at length for the kerr - newman case . ] . here",

    "the ergosphere is between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "with @xmath145 we thus have shown that the light cones are erect somewhere between the ergosphere and the `` time machine '' ( as we claimed in section  [ expl - sec ] ) .",
    "we note that the two event horizons are at @xmath146 ( these are the roots of @xmath67 ) . for @xmath147 and @xmath148",
    "see also figure  [ series - fig ] .",
    "we have established the following , see figure  [ functions - fig ] : @xmath149    we are interested in the behavior of the light cones as we move from @xmath80 towards @xmath98 .",
    "we have just shown that in this interval the time - axis is always timelike , i.e.  that it is within the light cone .",
    "we will now establish the following statements concerning the light cones as depicted in figure  [ cone - fig ] as we move from @xmath80 to @xmath98 :    ( 1 ) : :    the center @xmath116 of the light cone moves from zero to minus    infinity , monotonically , ( 2 ) : :    the diameter of the light cone grows to infinity , monotonically , ( 3 ) : :    the right side of the light cone is always  slower \" than    @xmath121 .    as a consequence of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the left side of the light cone lowers towards the horizontal plain .",
    "we could summarize these statements as  the light cone tilts in the negative @xmath47 direction and opens up \" .",
    "to prove ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , first we show that    : :    @xmath150    decreases monotonically as we move from @xmath80 towards @xmath98 .",
    "its radial derivative is    : :    @xmath151 $ ] .    by @xmath152",
    "we have @xmath153 .",
    "thus , @xmath94 decreases monotonically as we move from @xmath80 to @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , the reader is reminded that @xmath94 is positive in the open interval @xmath154r_1,r_0[$ ] and zero for @xmath98 .",
    "now , as can be seen in figure  [ functions - fig ] , @xmath155 is negative and decreases monotonically as we move from @xmath80 to @xmath98 .",
    "hence @xmath156 is negative and approaches monotonically minus infinity as we move from @xmath80 to @xmath98 .",
    "this proves ( 1 ) .    to prove ( 2 ) ,",
    "we first compute :    : :    @xmath157 : :    @xmath158 .",
    "this is always positive for @xmath159 , and since it is a second - order polynomial in @xmath4 whose roots are larger than @xmath80 , it increases as we move from @xmath80 to @xmath98 .",
    "the same is true for the square root of the above expression .",
    "since @xmath94 decreases monotonically , this shows that the  diameter \" of the light cone increases monotonically as we move from @xmath80 towards @xmath98 .",
    "it approaches infinity because @xmath98 is the root of @xmath94 .",
    "thus , ( 2 ) has been proved .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath160 , i.e.  @xmath161 where + @xmath162 .",
    "let us use the notation @xmath163 . now",
    ": :    @xmath164 : :    @xmath165/[g_{\\varphi\\varphi}(s+g_{t\\varphi})]=$ ] : :    @xmath166 .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the above expression as we move @xmath4 from @xmath80 towards @xmath98 . when substituting the values for @xmath138 and @xmath94 we get    : :    @xmath167\\le$ ] : :    @xmath168    because @xmath169 if @xmath159 . with this , ( 3 ) has been proved .",
    "we have seen in sections  [ expl - sec ] and [ app - sec ] that if you want to time travel in a kerr - newman spacetime , you have to orbit around the @xmath7 axis in the direction opposite to the rotation carried out by the singularity . in other words , a time traveler must counter - rotate with the singularity .",
    "the same happens in kerr spacetime , see section  [ kn - sec ] .",
    "as it turns , however , the phenomenon of counter - rotation is not limited to these important classes of spacetimes .",
    "the same counter - rotation phenomenon is present in van stockum s rotating dust solution ( @xcite ) , in the tipler - van stockum fast - rotating cylinder ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and in gdel s rotating universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "counter - rotation in the first two examples is discussed in @xcite , for counter - rotation in the third example see @xcite .",
    "moreover , the same phenomenon is also present in the case of gott s cosmic strings based ctcs , cf.@xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "14 , p.  108 ) . there",
    "the ctcs counter - rotate with the system formed by the pair of strings .    in sum ,",
    "thus , in at least five of the most prominent examples of spacetimes involving ctcs , the future direction on the ctcs opposes the rotational sense of the source of the gravitational field . in this paper . for the rest of our examples , we use slightly different invariant formulations . for example , in gdel s spacetime an invariant formulation can be obtained by following gdel s wording in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , lines 1 - 10 ) .",
    "gdel uses gyroscopes as  compasses of inertia \" in the sense of @xcite and rindler  . ]",
    "this raises a question : is this counter - rotation an accident or is it a mathematical or at least physical necessity in some sense , e.g.  under some suitable physical assumptions , all of which must of course be satisfied by the five examples above ?",
    "one of these assumptions is that the ctcs in question are `` created '' by rotation of matter , i.e.  rotation of the gravitational source . in its present form",
    "this question is somewhat loose and rather programmatic .",
    "let us thus give a more tangible formulation of this question .",
    "* question 2 . * in general ,",
    "how important is it for the ctcs to counter - rotate against the rotational sense of the gravitating matter which brings about the ctcs ?",
    "in particular , is there any example of a spacetime where the ctcs are generated by rotating matter and there is no counter - rotation effect ?",
    "we believe that our calculations and our arguments above and in @xcite not only admit the relevance and interest in asking this question , but moreover , strongly suggest that there might well be a general principle at work : a principle which states that ctcs generated by rotating matter must spiral in the opposite direction from the rotational sense of the matter .",
    "we are not sure how much work such a principle would offer toward a general understanding of the mechanisms which bring about spacetime structures that contain ctcs .",
    "but it strikes us as an observation which is potentially crucial for such an endeavor , particularly because the phenomenon seems so pervasive in such an important set of spacetimes with ctcs .",
