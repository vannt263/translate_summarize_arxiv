    "the top quark and the higgs boson are the heaviest known fundamental particles .",
    "these two particles and their mutual interactions can play crucial roles in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "while global analyses of the higgs interactions based on the effective field theory ( eft ) approach are available in literatures , the top quark couplings have been rarely studied with the same strategy . in this talk",
    "we will discuss the theoretical framework for a global approach to top quark couplings , in particular with a focus on higher - order qcd corrections and their impacts on the global strategy .",
    "the millions of top quarks produced at the tevatron and the lhc have brought top physics to its precision era . in the past year , progresses have been made in the measurements of various top processes , thanks to the 8 tev data set at the lhc . the single top production in @xmath0 channel has been observed for the first time @xcite . several measurements and searches on the @xmath1 final state",
    "have been updated @xcite , and new constraints on the flavor - changing neutral couplings , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , become available @xcite .    to extract top - quark couplings from these measurements ,",
    "the eft provides a suitable theoretical framework .",
    "while eft has been widely used as a model - independent description of new physics , here we want to emphasize that this approach has the advantage of being consistent at higher orders in perturbative calculation .",
    "this is an important feature for top physics , as qcd corrections are in general not negligible for top - quark processes at hadron colliders , in particular when non - sm couplings are involved .",
    "furthermore , in certain processes these couplings are accessible only through a top - quark loop .",
    "therefore a reliable analysis requires predictions within the eft framework at nlo accuracy .    in an eft approach ,",
    "deviations from the sm are described by adding higher - dimensional gauge - invariant operators to the sm lagrangian .",
    "these operators are suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the scale at which new physics lives .",
    "the theory can be renormalized order by order in @xmath5 , provided that all operators up to a certain order are incorporated .",
    "thus perturbative calculations can be systematically improved , to any desired order of @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the eft is a consistent approach only if the complete set of operators are taken into account . in particular , turning on one or several operators at a time may lead to misleading or even basis - dependent conclusions .",
    "one example is the two `` blind directions '' appeared in precision electroweak fit @xcite .",
    "these directions are transparent only in certain operator basis and can be overlooked if one turns on only one operator at a time .",
    "this is one of the reasons why a global analysis can be important .    at nlo ,",
    "a global strategy becomes even more crucial , as the renormalization group ( rg ) mixing effects clearly reveals the intrinsic relations among different operators .",
    "the evolution of operators are described by a matrix , and mixing effects among different operator coefficients occur whenever the renormalization scale changes .",
    "conceptually , this implies that the very definition of top couplings are obscured at nlo , and the distinction between individual couplings can depend on the scale at which they are probed .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : rg ] , where the rg flows of the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are displayed .",
    "these two operators give rise to anomalous @xmath9 and @xmath10 couplings , respectively .",
    "the top eft has been studied at leading order ( lo ) for a long time ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . at nlo , however , there are still many aspects that require further work .",
    "qcd corrections to most dimension - six operators remain to be studied , and for certain processes these include higher - order contaminations from operators not involved at the tree level . in addition , simulation tools that are capable of doing such calculations are desirable in order to have realistic analyses . in the next section",
    "we will give a brief summary of some recent progresses made in the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) sector of the top quark .",
    "the @xmath11 distribution of top quark in @xmath12 at @xmath13 tev .",
    "photon @xmath14 gev and @xmath15 cuts are imposed .",
    "@xmath16 tev .",
    "coefficients are chosen within the current limits . ]     the @xmath11 distribution of top quark in @xmath12 at @xmath13 tev .",
    "photon @xmath14 gev and @xmath15 cuts are imposed .",
    "@xmath16 tev .",
    "coefficients are chosen within the current limits . ]",
    "processes triggered by the fcnc couplings of the top quark are highly suppressed in the sm by the gim mechanism , thus any signal observed indicates new physics .",
    "a wide variety of limits have been set on top - quark fcnc interactions .",
    "currently the best ones on trilinear couplings are from decay processes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and production processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 , all have been searched at the lhc . on the other hand , single top production at lep2 could provide limits on contact four - fermion interactions .    in an eft",
    "the fcnc couplings involving one top - quark and one light - quark field arise from the following dimension - six operators :    @xmath21 where the subscript @xmath22 is the generation of the quark field .",
    "@xmath23 is the third - generation doublet . for operators with @xmath24 superscript ,",
    "a similar set of operators with @xmath25 flavor structure can be obtained by interchanging @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we further define @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , four - fermion operators including two quarks and two leptons are also relevant .",
    "a full list can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the limits obtained by experimental collaborations almost always assume one single fcnc interaction is present at a time . in addition , four - fermion operators are neglected in most cases .",
    "these operators could for example describe models where fcnc couplings are mediated by new heavy particles . while they could obviously contribute to @xmath30 , their effects in top decay",
    "@xmath31 are not negligible either , even after applying the @xmath32-mass window cuts on the lepton pairs . to have a complete understanding of the current status , one should follow a global approach where all fcnc operators are turned on simultaneously .",
    "recently , theoretical ingredients required for such a global analysis have been completed at nlo accuracy . in the fcnc sector",
    "the relevant mixing effects are those among @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and their @xmath25 counterparts .",
    "nlo predictions for fcnc processes are now available with the operator mixing effects properly taken into account .",
    "various of decay processes have been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these processes",
    "the @xmath37 corrections come from not only the standard qcd corrections to dimension - six operators , but also from the operators @xmath35 and @xmath38 , which affect top decays only at nlo .",
    "contributions from four - fermion operators in three - body decays are also included .",
    "on the production side , single top production @xmath19 has been computed in ref .",
    "more recently , the full set of two - fermion fcnc operators , listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : allfcnc ] ) , have been implemented in the mg5_amc@nlo framework @xcite , using feynrules @xcite and nloct @xcite .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "this allows for processes such as @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , to be computed automatically at nlo and matched to parton shower simulation . for illustration",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : pt ] the @xmath11 distribution in @xmath12 at 8 tev center of mass energy . the @xmath30 process can be studied in the same framework , with the caveat that the four - fermion operators are no yet available .",
    "they are planned to be implemented in future , and for the moment analytical results for these operators can be used .    with the above results , a global fit including all processes mentioned in this section can be performed . from the published information it is not clear to us how to combine the 95% cl bounds from different measurements consistently . however , to illustrate the feasibility of this approach , a toy fit is straightforward , by naively combining available limits on branching ratios and cross sections . in figure",
    "[ fig : limits ] we show some results from the toy fit .",
    "the blue lines are obtained by setting other coefficients to zero , while the red lines are obtained by allowing other coefficients to float .",
    "for some operators the blue and red lines are different , indicating that a correlation is present between the operators .",
    "these information are available from the global fit .",
    "the complete analysis is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    left : limits on two - fermion operator coefficients .",
    "blue lines indicate limits obtained by setting other coefficients to zero .",
    "red lines are obtained by allowing other coefficients to float .",

    "right : limits on some four - fermion operators .",
    "their definitions can be found in ref .",
    "the non - fcnc sector is more complicated .",
    "the top couplings are parameterized by the following operators @xcite @xmath41 four - fermion operators are not listed here .    lcccccccccc process & @xmath8 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath7 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 + @xmath50 & n & & l & l & & & & l & & + @xmath51 & n & & l & l & & & & l & & + @xmath52 & l & & l & l&&&&n&n&n + @xmath53 & l&&&&&&n&l&l&l + @xmath54 & l&l&l & & & & n&l&l&l + @xmath55 & l&l&l&l&l&l&n&l&l&l + @xmath56 & l & & & & & & l&l&l&l + @xmath57 , @xmath58 & n & & & & & & n&&&l +    table 1 displays some of the key processes at the lhc , together with the relevant operators in each process .",
    "most two - fermion operators are constrained to some level , thanks to the recent lhc data . however , more aspects need to be studied before a real global fit can be made . in a global approach",
    "a complete operator basis should be used , which means that one should include not only four - fermion operators that are often neglected , but also operators with no top - quark field , such as @xmath59 they are included in table 1 , and could indeed affect most top processes .",
    "mixing effects may be important .",
    "for instance , a non - vanishing operator @xmath8 at 1 tev scale can induce an operator @xmath7 at the scale @xmath60 , with @xmath61 from the qcd mixing term .",
    "moreover , operators without a top - quark field , such as @xmath62 and @xmath49 , can be relevant through mixing effects .",
    "in particular the anomalous dimensions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are non zero ( the last one has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "once the mixing is understood , complete nlo calculation can be carried out .",
    "while some operators only give rise to sm - like couplings , others are essentially of higher dimension , and qcd corrections are unknown in most cases , with a few exceptions such as top - decay processes as well as four - fermion operators in @xmath66 production . from the study of fcnc sector",
    "we see that these corrections can be potentially large , and so it is important know their sizes .",
    "the feasibility of implementing these operators in the mg5_amc@nlo framework is being investigated .",
    "with a variety of top processes investigated at the lhc , global analyses based on top eft are expected to provide a complete understanding of top - quark couplings .",
    "however , qcd corrections can be potentially important , and a reliable analysis at nlo accuracy requires further theoretical efforts .",
    "we have shown that recent progress completes the theoretical predictions in the top fcnc sector . while the flavor - conserving sector can be more complicated , the feasibility of the same approach is being studied , and automatic nlo calculations involving higher - dimensional top - quark operators can be expected in future .",
