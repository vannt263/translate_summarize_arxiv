    "coincides with maximum amplitude of the other mode_. maximum phase of the first overtone occurs just before maximum of its amplitude . for the second overtone ,",

    "characteristic pattern of periodic modulation displayed in fig.[fig3 ] is common to all cepheids listed in table[table1 ] .",
    "the phenomenon is similar to the blazhko effect in rr  lyrae stars ( _ e.g. _ kurtz _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite ) . by analogy , variables of table[table1 ] can be called `` blazhko double mode cepheids '' .      in 17 fo",
    "/ so double mode cepheids ( 16% of the sample ) we find after prewhitening a significant residual power unresolved from the primary pulsation frequencies .",
    "this is a signature of slow amplitude and/or phase variability , not resolved within the length of available data ( _ i.e. _ @xmath25days ) .",
    "-1.6truecm    for closer examination of this slow variability we have performed for each star a similar analysis to that presented in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "specifically , we have divided the data into 10 subsets , each spanning 10% of the total timebase , and then have fitted eq.(1 ) separately to each subset . in some stars",
    "we have detected only changes of pulsation phases , but in 10 variables we have also detected clear changes of the amplitudes . in fig.[fig4 ] we show typical example of such behaviour .",
    "the pattern of amplitude and phase variability is very much the same as that displayed in fig.[fig3 ] . in particular ,",
    "the amplitudes of the two radial modes vary in opposite directions .",

    "periodic amplitude and phase modulation in fo / so double mode cepheids is by no mean a rare phenomenon . according to our analysis its incidence rate is at least 19% and perhaps as high as 35% .",
    "two models have been proposed to explain blazhko modulation in rr  lyrae stars : the oblique magnetic pulsator model ( shibahashi @xcite , @xcite ) and 1:1 resonance model ( nowakowski & dziembowski @xcite ) .",
    "we will argue , that both these models fail to account for modulation observed in the fo / so double mode cepheids .",
    "the oblique magnetic pulsator model assumes presence of a dipole magnetic field , which is inclined to the rotation axis of the star .",
    "the field introduces distortion to the radial pulsation .",
    "as the star rotates , this distortion is viewed from different angles , causing variation of the pulsation amplitude . however , in this scenario both modes should display maximum amplitude simultaneously , because they are both distorted in the same way .",
    "this is not what we observe .",
    "the model proposed by nowakowski & dziembowski ( @xcite ) assumes resonant coupling of a radial mode to _ nonradial _ modes of @xmath28 .",
    "such a mechanism generates in a natural way a triplet of equally spaced frequencies .",
    "the beating of these frequencies causes apparent amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "generalizing this model to coupling with modes of @xmath29 , we can also explain frequency quintuplets .",
    "however , in this resonance model , modulation of each radial mode is an independent effect .",
    "therefore , there is no reason why both modes should be modulated with the same period .",
    "there is also no reason why amplitude variations of the modes should be in any particular phase relation to each other ( as is observed ) .",
    "finally , the 1:1 resonance model does not explain why in vast majority of cases modulation is observed either in both radial modes or in none of them .    at this stage ,",
    "the mechanism causing amplitude and phase modulation of fo / so double mode cepheids remains unknown .",
    "nevertheless , the available observations already provide some important clues .",
    "the fact that the two modes are always modulated with the same period proves that their behaviour is not independent .",
    "both modes must be part of the same dynamical system .",
    "the fact that high amplitude of one mode always coincides with low amplitude of the other mode strongly suggests that energy transfer between the two modes is involved .",
    "thus , available evidence clearly points towards some form of mode coupling in which both radial modes take part .",
