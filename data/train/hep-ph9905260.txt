    "recently the many works ,- particle see the works referred in s.ishida et al.96 in references.@xcite ] suggesting existence of the light @xmath0-particle both theoretically and phenomenologically , had been published and the @xmath0-particle was revived in the newest lists of pdg96 and 98 after missing more than two decades , although still with an obscure index `` @xmath4-@xmath5 or @xmath0 '' . among them",
    "our group of collaboration had also given rather strong evidences for its existence through a series of papers,@xcite while received a serious criticism .",
    "in this talk i shall summarize the essential points of controversies and explain our answers to the criticism clearly , leading to the suggestion as is given in the abstract :    from early 1980 s the importance of the @xmath0 in relation to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking had been stressed by the works.@xcite possible evidences suggesting for existence of the @xmath0 in production processes had been given in the works.@xcite the reanalyses of the @xmath6 scattering phase shifts , leading to the rather strong evidences for the @xmath0 were done by the works.@xcite    the results of our series of works were reported in the several occasions,@xcite of which criticisms are found in the references.@xcite some useful arguments and discussions , which make the crucial points clear , were given in the references.@xcite      first possible evidence for direct @xmath0-production , which was obtained in a proton proton central collision process at 450gev / c @xmath7 was reported@xcite by the gams kek - subgroup at manchester , hadron95 .",
    "the obtained @xmath8 mass spectra are given in fig .",
    "1 . they fitted the spectra by the variant mass and width(vmw ) method , representing the invariant production amplitude as a coherent sum of breit - wigner amplitudes of resonances , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "= 4.0 cm    there the huge concentration of @xmath1-wave events below 1 gev , to which similar spectra had also been found in other experiments@xcite and taken as the mere background before , was interpreted as being due to @xmath11-particle production .    however , this interpretation of @xmath0 production was severely criticized@xcite in the summary talk of the hadron95 from the so - called `` universality argument . ''",
    "it says `` claims of a narrow @xmath12 in the gams results can not be correct as '' + @xmath13 no @xmath0 is seen in the @xmath6 scattering .",
    "+ @xmath14 unitarity demands the production amplitude @xmath15 to be consistent with the scattering amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "+ due to this serious criticism the gams group himself had taken a very cautious attitude@xcite on the @xmath0-particle to state formally that `` in summary the analysis of @xmath17 system @xmath18 confirms a large concentration of @xmath1-wave events below 1 gev , which interferes with @xmath19 destructively @xmath18 .",
    "this would be compatible with a broad @xmath1-wave state @xmath18 but its coference with the known @xmath6-scattering phase shifts is still the object of controversy that bears basic non - perturbative qcd concepts . ''",
    "on the other hand our group had reanalyzed,@xcite in replying to the criticism @xmath13 , the @xmath6 phase shifts by using the interfering ( breit - wigner ) amplitude ( ia ) method which satisfies the elastic unitarity automatically and shown that the @xmath0-particle actually exists .",
    "furthermore , our group had also investigated,@xcite in replying to the criticism @xmath14 , the relation between the scattering and the production amplitudes and shown our @xmath15 in the vmw method and @xmath16 in the ia method satisfy consistently the unitarity of @xmath1-matrix .",
    "meanwhile , there have been opened some useful arguments@xcite to make clear the critical points . through the above processes i believe that now the answers to all the criticisms have been given",
    "we made recently a reanalysis@xcite of the old cerm - munich 73 and 74 data of @xmath6 phase shifts and found a strong evidence for existence of @xmath0-particle .",
    "there we applied the ia - method , which satisfies the elastic unitarity automatically and is parametrized only in terms of physically meaningful quantities as masses and widths of resonances . in a simple case of one @xmath20-channel and two resonant @xmath21 and @xmath22 particles the partial @xmath1-wave @xmath1-matrix in the ia method",
    "is given as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath1-matrix in the case of pure resonant ( background ) scattering and the @xmath25 represent the phase shifts due to the respective pure scattering cases .",
    "the unitarity of total @xmath1-matrix @xmath1 is reduced to the unitarity of each `` component @xmath1-matrix '' @xmath26 ; @xmath27 the scattering amplitude @xmath28 due to resonances @xmath29 is given as @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the breit - wigner amplitude of the @xmath32 resonance ( @xmath33 etc . , @xmath34 ) .",
    "the last term in the r.h.s . of eq.([eq4 ] ) represents an `` interference '' between the @xmath0 and @xmath35 ( b.w .",
    ") amplitudes .",
    "the physical reason for obtaining the different result even with using the same experimental data is our introduction of `` negative background phase '' @xmath36 of hard core type @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pion momentum in the @xmath39 cm system and the @xmath40 a parameter .",
    "the physical origin of the @xmath36 is able to be reduced@xcite to the compensating repulsive interaction guaranteed by the chiral symmetry,@xcite and it is describable quantitatively in the framework of linear @xmath0 model including the @xmath41-meson contribution.@xcite    .",
    "comparison between the fit with @xmath42 and with @xmath43 in our psa .",
    "the latter corresponds to the conventional analyses thus far made . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : conventional ]    the results of our re - analyses are given in fig .",
    "2(a ) , while in table  [ tab : conventional ] i compare the essential points and the results of our analysis with those of the conventional one.@xcite in our analysis the introduction of repulsive @xmath36 with @xmath44gev@xmath45 ( 0.60fm , about the structural size of pion ) plays a crucial role for the existence of @xmath0(600 ) .",
    "the sum of the large attractive @xmath46 , contribution due to @xmath0(600 ) , and the large repulsive @xmath36 gives a small positive phase shift , which was treated , in the conventional analysis , as a background ( or broad @xmath47900 ) ) contribution @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "note that the fit with @xmath40=0 in our analyses corresponds to the conventional analyses without the repulsive @xmath36 thus far made . in this case",
    "the mass and width of ",
    "@xmath0 \" becomes large , and the  @xmath0\"-breit - wigner formula can be regarded as an effective range formula describing a positive background phase .",
    "the corresponding pole position is close to that of @xmath49(900 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath50 is @xmath50 = 163.4 , worse by 140 than that in our best fit .",
    "we found also some evidences@xcite for existence of the @xmath0-particle as an intermediate state of the @xmath6 system in the production processes spectra in the process @xmath51 observed in the crystal barrel experiment , and found that they are reasonably well understood as due to production of the @xmath0 with @xmath52 mev and @xmath53 mev in addition to the resonances considered there . ] by analyzing the data obtained through the _ pp _ central collision experiment by gams@xcite and the data in the @xmath54 decay reported by dm2 collabration@xcite . in the analyses we applied the variant mass and width(vmw)-method , where the production amplitude is represented by a sum of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 breit - wigner amplitudes with relative phase factors @xmath55",
    "the general problem to be examined is whether our applied methods of analyses are consistent with the unitarity of @xmath1 matrix : the scattering amplitude @xmath16 must satisfy the elastic unitarity and the production amplitude @xmath15 must have , in case that the initial state has no strong phase , the same phase as @xmath16 : @xmath56 ( fsi ; final - state - interaction theorem ) .",
    "conventionally , the more restrictive relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is required on the basis of the ",
    "universality,\"@xcite @xmath57 with a _ slowly varying _ real function @xmath58 of @xmath59 .",
    "i have already shown that our @xmath16 in the ia method satisfies the elastic unitarity automatically .",
    "the remaining problem is whether our @xmath15 in the vmw method is consistent with the fsi theorem or not .      here",
    "i shall describe our general line of thought on the strong interaction of hadrons , our relevant problem .",
    "it is a residual interaction of qcd among color - singlet bare - hadrons , which are the @xmath60 bound states of quark and anti - quark systems .",
    "first let us consider an old example of the strong interaction among pions and nucleons .",
    "@xmath61 knowing the quark physics , the @xmath41 and the @xmath62 were @xmath63 of @xmath39 system and @xmath64 system , respectively , produced through the strong interaction among the basic pion and nucleon fields .",
    "however , presently @xmath65 knowing the quark physics , the @xmath41 and the @xmath62 should also be treated as basic fields equally as the @xmath2 and the @xmath66 : the stable bare particle @xmath67 as the bound state of @xmath68 system becomes the unstable physical particle @xmath69 after switching on the strong interaction among bare - particles @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this example",
    "an @xmath1-matrix @xmath1 consistent with the unitarity is obtained , in the framework of ( local ) field theory , following the conventional procedure , if we know a properly supposed strong interaction hamiltonian @xmath72 among basic bare fields , which is hermitian @xmath73 : @xmath74 in our relevant problem of scalar mesons , we should take as basic fields the bare fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 as well as the @xmath77 . here",
    "we take a view - point that the @xmath0 and the @xmath35 are some intrinsic quark - dynamics states(possibly to be relativistic @xmath1-wave @xmath78 states ) . in this case",
    "we set up ( as a simple example ) the strong interaction hamiltonian @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are real coupling constants , `` p '' denoting a relevant production channel .",
    "due to the ( former ) interaction ( [ eq7 ] ) the stable bare states @xmath82 and @xmath76 change into the physical states denoted as @xmath83 , and @xmath0 and @xmath35 with finite widths",
    ". then we can derive the scattering and production amplitudes following the standard procedure of quantum field theory .",
    "the general structure of @xmath16 and @xmath15 is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figcomp ] , where shaded ellipses represent the final state interaction of the @xmath39 system .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that correctly both the mechanisms in fig .",
    "[ figcomp ] should be taken into account .",
    "= 4.5 cm    as a result the @xmath16 and the @xmath15 are , in principle , mutually independent quantities , reflecting the coupling constants @xmath84 and @xmath85 being so .    in the conventional treatment , where only the former mechanism is taken into account",
    ", the function @xmath58 in eq.([eq : fat ] ) becomes @xmath86 this leads to essentially the same @xmath39-mass spectra in any production process as in the scattering process , which is evidently inconsistent with experimental facts . accordingly in the conventional analysis the @xmath58 is assumed to have the form ( which is generally _ not varying slowly _ ) @xmath87 introducing and @xmath88 are determined from physical quantities @xmath89 and @xmath90 . ] the physically meaningless parameters @xmath91 , and fixing the value of @xmath88 , the zero - point of @xmath16 , from the scattering experiments .",
    "this procedure implies that production experiments generally lose their values in seeking for resonant particles . in the correct treatment considering both the former and the latter mechanisms ,",
    "the direct peak of the @xmath6 mass spectra due to the @xmath92-particle production is to be observed in the production process , if its production coupling constant @xmath85 is dominant , in conformity with our intuition .",
    "thus the production experiments have generally their own values independent from the scattering experiments .",
    "= 2.5 cm    in the previous work@xcite resorting to the above model we have derived our methods of analyses , the ia method for @xmath16 and the vmw method for @xmath15 , and shown their consistency with the fsi theorem .",
    "the obtained formulas of the amplitudes ( derived as solutions of schwinger - dyson equations shown in fig .",
    "4 ) were@xcite @xmath93 in the `` bare - state representation . ''",
    "these formulas of @xmath16 and @xmath15 are rewritten and @xmath94 in eq.([eq6 ] ) are expressed in terms of @xmath95 and @xmath96 and shown to be almost @xmath59-independent except for the threshold region .",
    "however , we must note on the following :   in the vmw - method essentially the three new parameters , @xmath97 and the relative phase @xmath98 , independent of the scattering process , characterize the relevant production processes",
    ". presently they are represented by the two production coupling constants , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "thus , among the three parameters there exists one constraint due to the fsi - theorem . ] into the forms of eq.([eq4 ] ) and eq.([eq6 ] ) , respectively , in the `` physical state representation . ''",
    "meson effects . in eq.([eq12",
    "] ) we also made simplification by identifying the `` @xmath101-matrix states '' with the bare states .",
    "as for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ] the consistency of the amplitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 are easily seen from eq.([eq12 ] ) since @xmath101 and @xmath102 are real and their phases come only from their common denominator @xmath103 .",
    "i have explained that our methods of analyses , the interfering amplitude method for treating the @xmath6 scattering process and the vmw method for the @xmath6 prodcution process ( which were effective in leading to evidences for the @xmath0-existence ) are consistent with the unitarity of @xmath1-matrix .",
    "thus the conventional treatments along the line of universality argument are proved to be not correct .",
    "accordingly i have stressed that production experiments of resonant particles have generally their own value independent of scattering experiments .",
    "+ it is considered that confirmation of the @xmath0-particle with low mass and vacuum quantum number , which possibly appears in various processes , and its @xmath104 treatment is crucially important for hadron physics .",
    "+ finally , on the basis of the present talk , i propose that the present index `` @xmath4 - 1200 ) or @xmath0 '' in pdg98 is to be corrected as @xmath105 - 800 ) in the pdg future edition .     _",
    "the  present  speaker  acknowledges  deeply  to  the  commitee  of   this  workshop   for  giving  him  this  nice  opportunity  of  presentation .",
