    "the concept of network coding originated in the year 2000 @xcite .",
    "the area of network coding has been an area of active research since then .",
    "it was shown that network coding is necessary to achieve the min - cut bound in a multicast network .",
    "it was further shown , in subsequent works @xcite , that linear network coding is sufficient to achieve the capacity of a multicast network . however , in a more general scenario where there are multiple sources and multiple terminals in a network , and each terminal requires information generated at a subset of sources , capacity can not always be achieved through linear network coding @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors constructed a network in which the capacity is achievable through non - linear network coding , but not through linear network coding .",
    "however , since linear network coding has an inherent structure to it , and as it is easier to implement practically as opposed to non - linear network coding , the possibility of achieving a greater throughput by using non - linear network codes does not undermines the necessity to study linear network coding .",
    "linear coding capacity is defined as the supremum of all achievable rates that can be achieved by using linear network coding .",
    "it has been shown that linear coding capacity may depend on the characteristic of the finite field .",
    "the fano network presented in @xcite has linear coding capacity equal to one when the characteristic of the finite field is two , but when the characteristic is not two , the linear coding capacity is @xmath2 .",
    "another network , presented in the same reference @xcite , has linear coding capacity equal to one if the characteristic of the finite field is not two , but has linear coding capacity equal to @xmath3 if the characteristic of the finite field is two .",
    "later , in @xcite , it was shown that for any given finite or co - finite set of prime numbers , there exists a network which has linear coding capacity equal to one if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belong to the given set .    in this paper , we consider linear network coding in the context of a function computation problem over a network .",
    "we consider a special case of general function computation problem over a network where each terminal demand the sum of symbols generated at all the sources . such a network has been termed as a sum - network in the literature .",
    "the study of sum - networks include the function computation problem where all the terminals demand a linear combination of source symbols when the source symbols are from a finite field @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous studies on sum - networks . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that if the number of sources or the number of terminals in a sum - network is two and there is at least one path from each source to each terminal , then the linear coding capacity of such a sum - network is at least @xmath4 . however ,",
    "when the number of sources or terminals are greater than two , at least one path from each source to each terminal does not suffice achievability of rate @xmath4 .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite independently presented a sum - network having three sources and three terminals which has capacity equal to @xmath5 . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors also showed that if the sum - network having three source and three terminal has min - cut equal to two between any source and any terminal , then the linear coding capacity of the network is at least @xmath4 .",
    "however , this property also fails to hold for larger sum - networks @xcite .",
    "for a class of sum - networks having @xmath6 sources and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) terminals or @xmath9 ( @xmath8 ) sources and @xmath6 terminals , it was shown that there exist networks which have linear coding capacity of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a positive integer greater than or equal to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it was also conjectured that the capacity of sum - network in this class is always of the form @xmath10 @xcite . till date",
    "this conjecture has neither been proven nor anyone has given a counter example .",
    "the work in @xcite relates the study of sum - networks with the networks where every terminal demands a subset of information generated at the sources , and thereby proved various results for the sum - networks .",
    "it was shown that for any multiple - unicast network there exists a sum - network which is solvable if and only if the the multiple unicast network is solvable .",
    "this showed that many results like insufficiency of liner network coding , unachievability of network coding capacity , nonreversibility , which are true from multiple unicast networks , are also true from sum - networks .",
    "moreover , given a sum - network , it has also been shown that there exists a linear solvably equivalent multiple - unicast network .    for sum - networks too , the linear coding capacity is dependent on the characteristic of the finite field .",
    "reference @xcite and @xcite show that for any given finite or co - finite set of primes , there exists a sum - network which has linear coding capacity equal to one if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belong to the given set .",
    "it follows from this results that , to achieve the capacity by using linear network coding , it is necessary to know over which finite field the network code must be designed . however , to the best of our knowledge , for sum - networks , the dependency of linear coding capacity on the characteristic of the finite field , has been shown only for sum - networks which has capacity equal to one .",
    "we generalize this result for sum - networks with capacity equal to any positive rational number .",
    "specifically we show that , for any given positive rational number @xmath0 , and for any given set of finite or co - finite set of prime numbers , there exists a sum - network which has capacity equal to @xmath0 , where the rate @xmath0 can be achieved using fractional linear network coding if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set .",
    "we note that , in a recent work , similar results have been shown for the class of multiple - unicast networks @xcite .",
    "it is known that the capacity of sum - networks can be any rational number @xcite . for",
    "any given positive rational number @xmath0 , rai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite constructed a sum - network which has capacity equal to @xmath0 .",
    "reference @xcite and @xcite improved this result by showing that for some rational numbers , the same result can be obtained in a sum - network that uses significantly less number of sources and terminals .",
    "given the fact that one construction of sum - networks , which are linearly solvable if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belong to a finite / co - finite set of primes , has already been given in @xcite , it is intuitive to think that a combination of the sum - networks presented in @xcite and @xcite would lead to the result we desire in this paper .",
    "however , we have found that this is not so imminent .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ sum1 ] we reproduce a sum - network from @xcite .",
    "this network , denoted here by @xmath13 , has a vector linear solution for any vector dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field is @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "[ sum2 ] we show a sum - network @xmath14 which has network @xmath13 as a sub - network .",
    "it can be shown that the capacity of the network @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "we find that the sub - network @xmath13 fails to enforce the restriction on the characteristic of the finite field in sum - network @xmath14 . as shown in fig.[sum3 ] , the rate @xmath15 is achievable in @xmath14 using fractional linear network codes over any finite field .",
    "in @xcite , the authors presented two methods to construct sum - networks starting from graphs . in this paper",
    ", they made a remark ( remark 2 ) , `` in construction 2 , we chose to connect the starred source only a carefully chosen subset of the bottleneck edges . if instead we had connected it to all the bottleneck edges ( for instance ) , the starred terminal could only recover the source , under conditions on the characteristic of the field @xmath16 .",
    "our choice of the subset of bottleneck edges avoids this dependence on the field characteristic . '' however , the authors have neither proven that such is the case when the starred source is connected to all of the bottleneck edges , nor they have shown any such example .",
    "we too have failed to construct any such sum - networks using the construction methods given in @xcite .",
    "for example , we consider the sum - network which was originally used as an example in @xcite to demonstrate workings of the construction methods .",
    "we reproduce the sum - network here in fig .",

    "the fig .",
    "[ exp ] shows that the sum - network has a rate @xmath17 achieving fractional linear network coding solution over all finite fields .",
