    "the past few years have been an exciting time as extrasolar planets have been demonstrated to be widespread and multiple planetary systems have been found .",
    "the current census now numbers more than 100 extrasolar planets , in over 90 planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of these extrasolar planets have been detected via the reflex motion of the host star .",
    "as the existing census shows , this method has proven to be wildly successful . nonetheless",
    ", the reflex motion of the star is a measure of the planet s gravitational influence and is necessarily an _ indirect _ detection of the planet . as a consequence ,",
    "the only property of the planet that one can infer is its mass , and because of the mass function s dependence on the inclination angle ( @xmath1 ) , one can infer only a minimum mass .",
    "direct detection of reflected , absorbed , or emitted radiation from a planet allows for the possibility of complementary information , and likely a more complete characterization of the planet .",
    "the prototype of such a direct detection is the detection of sodium absorption lines in the atmosphere of the planet orbiting hd  209458 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the incidence of transiting planets will always remain low relative to the total number of planets known .",
    "the and gas giants of our solar system are described commonly as `` magnetic planets '' because they contain internal dynamo currents that are capable of generating a planetary - scale magnetic field .",
    "the dynamo currents themselves arise from the rapid rotation of a conducting fluid .",
    "the composition of the fluid varies from planet to planet , being liquid iron in the , probably metallic hydrogen in and , and probably a salty ocean in and . in turn",
    ", these planetary magnetic fields are immersed in the high - speed electrical gas emitted by the . via a coupling between the solar wind and the planetary magnetic field ,",
    "all of these magnetic planets produce radio emission .",
    "some of the extrasolar planets are also magnetic planets . @xcite have detected a modulation in the  h and  k lines of with a periodicity which is that of the planetary orbit .",
    "they interpret this as a magnetic interaction between the star and planet , though there is no constraint as yet on the magnetic field strength of the planet .",
    "other stars in their sample also appear to have modulations in the  h and  k lines , though it is not yet clear that these modulations are periodic with the orbital period of their planets , as is the case for .",
    "by analogy to solar system planets , there have been a number of suggestions and searches for natural radio emission from extrasolar planets .",
    "early searches were conducted by @xcite and @xcite . due to the lack of any known extrasolar planets at the time , these were necessarily blind searches .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite , building on empirical relations derived for solar system planets and calibrated by spacecraft fly - bys , have made specific predictions for the radio emission from the known extrasolar planets .",
    "detection of radio emission from an extrasolar planet would constitute a _",
    "direct _ detection and can yield fundamental information about the planet .",
    "first , a measurement of the radio emission is directly indicative of the polar magnetic field strength at the planet .",
    "for example , the high - frequency cutoff of jovian decametric bursts ( @xmath2  mhz ) is interpreted as being due to the jovian polar magnetic field strength , which allowed an estimate for the strength of the jovian magnetic field nearly  20  yr prior to the first _ in situ _ magnetic field observations . in turn , of course , the presence of a magnetic field provides a rough measure of the composition of the planet , insofar as it requires the planet s interior to have a conducting fluid . combined with an estimate of the planet s mass , one could deduce the composition of the fluid by analogy to the solar system planets ( liquid iron vs.  metallic hydrogen vs.  salty ocean ) .",
    "second , the periodic nature of the radio emission has been used to define precisely the planetary rotation periods of all of the gas giant planets in the solar system . as the magnetic field",
    "is presumed to be tied to the interior of the planet , it provides a more accurate measure of the planet s rotation rate than atmospheric phenomena such as clouds .",
    "for instance , the rotation period of was determined initially by observations of the differentially rotating cloud tops but then was redefined after detection of the neptunian radio emission @xcite .",
    "finally , testing the extent to which solar - system models of magnetic fields can be applied to extrasolar planets may have important implications for assessing the long - term `` habitability '' of any terrestrial planets found in the future .",
    "the importance of a magnetic field is that it deflects incident cosmic rays .",
    "if these particles reach the surface of an otherwise habitable planet , they may cause severe cellular damage and disruption of genetic material to any life on its surface or may prevent life from arising at all .",
    "a secondary importance of a magnetic field is that it can prevent the planet s atmosphere from being eroded by the stellar wind @xcite ; this process is thought to be a contributing factor to the relative thinness of the martian atmosphere .",
    "( this is of course unlikely to be an issue for extrasolar giant planets . )",
    "this paper extends and updates initial attempts to predict the radio emission of extrasolar giant planets by applying the solar - system determined `` radiometric bode s law '' to the current census of extrasolar planets . in",
    "[ sec : law ] we summarize briefly the various forms of the radiometric bode s law and the form we have adopted for use , in  [ sec : census ] we summarize the current state of the extrasolar planet census and predict the `` burst '' emission levels and frequencies for radio emission from these planets , in  [ sec : observe ] we use the initial observations from a 74  mhz sky survey to confront the model predictions with data , and in  [ sec : conclude ] we assess how existing and future radio telescopes may be able to detect radio emission from extrasolar planets and present our conclusions .",
    "all of the planets in the solar system with substantial magnetic fields are strong emitters of coherent cyclotron emission at radio wavelengths .",
    "the emission itself arises from energetic ( kev ) electrons propagating along magnetic field lines into active auroral regions @xcite .",
    "the source of the electron acceleration to high energies is ultimately a coupling between the incident solar wind and the planet s magnetic field .",
    "the precise details are not well understood , but the coupling arises from magnetic field reconnection in which the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind and the planetary magnetic field cancel at their interface , thereby energizing the plasma .",
    "energetic electrons in the energized plasma form a current flow planet - ward along the planet s magnetic field lines , with the lines acting effectively like low resistance wires .",
    "the energy in these magnetic field - aligned electric currents is deposited in the upper polar atmosphere and is responsible for the visible aurora . besides auroral emissions at visible wavelengths ( e.g. , northern lights ) , about  @xmath3@xmath4 of the solar wind input power is converted to escaping cyclotron radio emission @xcite .",
    "the auroral radio power from is of order @xmath5  w while for it is of order @xmath6  .",
    "the cyclotron emission process described is generic , and typically most efficient in the auroral region , about  13 planetary radii in altitude .",
    "specific details of the cyclotron emission process do differ from planet to planet , depending upon secondary effects such as the polar source location and beaming angles , which in turn depend upon the planet s magnetic field topology and low - altitude atmospheric density .",
    "nonetheless , applicable to all of the magnetic planets is a macroscopic relationship called the `` radiometric bode s law '' relating the incident solar wind power , the planet s magnetic field strength , and the median emitted radio power .",
    "various investigators @xcite have found @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the median emitted radio power , @xmath9 is the incident solar wind power , @xmath10@xmath4 is the efficiency at which the solar wind power is converted to emitted radio power , and @xmath11 .",
    "the values of the coefficient  @xmath12 and the power - law index  @xmath13 measured by various investigators have differed over the years based on the quantity of data available ; the early determinations were based on fly - bys of only and and measurements of the radio emission while later determinations include data from the voyager  2 and fly - bys as well . in general , the more recent work indicates higher efficiencies than the earlier work @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite extrapolated this relation to extrasolar planetary systems by making use of two scaling relations and adopting more recent estimates for  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 .",
    "the incident solar wind power depends upon the ram pressure of the solar wind and the cross - sectional area presented by the magnetosphere to the solar wind .",
    "the ram pressure of the solar wind depends on the star - planet distance  @xmath14 while the size of the planet s magnetosphere is related to its magnetic moment .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that planetary - scale , dynamo - driven magnetic fields are scalable , with a functional dependence on body mass , radius , and angular frequency ; and the presence of planetary - scale magnetic fields around the gas giants shows that his analysis does not depend upon the actual composition of the conducting fluid in the planet s interior .",
    "blackett s law relates a planet s magnetic moment ( its surface field times its radius cubed , @xmath15 ) to its rotation rate and mass by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the planet s rotation rate and  @xmath18 is its mass .",
    "since that time and with the inclusion of the voyager magnetic field observations at the outer planets , numerous planetary magnetic field scaling laws have been derived , each expanding upon but maintaining some similarity to blackett s law .    combining these various scaling relations , @xcite and @xcite found that the planet s median radio power driven by the stellar wind is @xmath19 we have normalized all quantities to those of .",
    "* appendix  a ) discussed slight differences to this radiometric bode s law , the differences result from the statistical spread in the various ( solar system ) planets magnetic moments and amount to slightly different exponents and/or a different coefficient .",
    "we stress various aspects of this radiometric bode s law .",
    "first , it is grounded in _ in situ _ measurements from spacecraft fly - bys of the gas giants as well as measurements of the radio emission .",
    "in particular , @xcite considered two forms of the radiometric bode s law , one incorporating measurements of only and and the other incorporating all five magnetic planets .",
    "the former gives lower power levels ( by a factor of  100 ) ; in equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) , we have adopted the latter because it is based on a complete census of magnetic planets in the solar system .",
    "second is the importance of the planet - star distance . as @xcite show , the radio power from is larger than that from or even though both of those planets have magnetic moments approximately 50  times larger than that of the .",
    "third , the power levels estimated by equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) are for emission into a solid angle of  4@xmath20 .",
    "emission solid angles for solar system planets span a large range .",
    "considering jovian decametric emission at macroscopic scales , emission occurrence is as @xmath21 . in estimating the flux density ,",
    "the relevant quantity is @xmath22 .",
    "( see equation  [ eqn : fluxdensity ] below and the discussion in @xcite . )",
    "assuming a smaller emission solid angle would mean reducing the nominal power levels of equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) by the factor @xmath23 .",
    "( this factor also explains the difference between the nominal power level for jupiter predicted by equation  [ eqn : rbl ] and the level quoted in  [ sec : intro ] . )",
    "fourth , the radiometric bode s law of equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) describes the _ median _ emitted power from the magnetospheres of the and all of the solar gas giants , including the _ non - io driven _ jovian decametric radio emission @xcite .",
    "planetary magnetospheres tend to act as `` amplifiers '' of the incident solar wind , so that an increase in the solar wind velocity ( and therefore incident pressure ) leads to geometrically higher emission levels .",
    "this effect is observed at all of the magnetized planets .",
    "for instance , the saturnian radio flux has been observed to increase by factors of  20 due to changes in the solar wind velocity @xcite . at the",
    ", the radio power has been observed to increase by a factor of  10 for every 200  km  s@xmath24 increase in the solar wind velocity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  5 ) ; the observed range of solar wind velocities at the is at least 400  km  s@xmath24 ( from  400  km  s@xmath24 to  800  km  s@xmath24 ) .",
    "the radio power levels from a planet can exceed that predicted by equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) by factors of  100 and possibly more .    finally , an implicit assumption in our analysis is that the mass loss rates for stars hosting planets are similar to that of the sun .",
    "the stellar wind pressure incident on a planetary magnetosphere is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the density of the stellar wind and  @xmath27 is its velocity .",
    "stars with higher ( lower ) mass loss rates than the will have higher ( lower ) stellar wind densities and should drive higher ( lower ) planetary radio emissions .",
    "differences in the mass loss rate from star to star could lead to statistical variations in the power levels we predict , though these should be relatively less important than variability in stellar wind velocities .",
    "( work is in progress to utilize what is known about the various stellar ages and activities to relax this assumption . )    in order for gyrating electrons to generate radio emission that escapes the auroral region , the doppler - shifted electron cyclotron frequency must couple directly to a magnetoplasma mode .",
    "this coupling can only occur in low density , high magnetic field conditions where the local electron plasma - to - cyclotron frequency ratio is much less than one .",
    "the regions just above the polar ionosphere satisfy this coupling criteria .",
    "hence , the characteristic emission frequency can be related to the planetary magnetic dipole moment ( equation  [ eqn : blackett ] ) by @xmath28 in order to be detected from ground - based telescopes , @xmath29 must exceed the terrestrial ionospheric cutoff ( defined by the peak ionospheric plasma frequency ) , which is typically 310  mhz .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath29 exceeded the ionospheric cutoff ( @xmath30  mhz ) for some planets known at the time of the publication of their paper , with the planet around having @xmath31  mhz .",
    "just as the statistical variations in the solar - system planetary magnetic moments contribute to variations in the radiometric bode s law , there is also a statistical spread in the exponents and/or coefficients for the emission frequency . compared to the radiated power predicted by equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) ,",
    "the statistical variations in the predicted emission frequency are relatively more important .",
    "the radiated power levels can be exponentially modified by the solar - wind loading whereas the emission frequency is not . in order to account for the statistical variations in estimates of the magnetic moment derived from blackett s law",
    ", we assume that the actual emission frequency could be larger or smaller by a factor of  3 than the nominal value of equation  ( [ eqn : fc ] ) .",
    "( see also appendix  a of @xcite . )",
    "the predicted flux density of an extrasolar planet is then @xmath32 @xcite applied equations  ( [ eqn : blackett])([eqn : fluxdensity ] ) to the nine then - known extrasolar planets .",
    "the distances to the host stars are known . the planetary mass and distance to its parent star",
    "are measured or constrained from the optical observations .",
    "assuming an emission cone of  @xmath33  sr , @xmath34 , and a rotation rate comparable to that of , they derived the resulting flux densities",
    ".    we shall do the same but for the currently much larger sample .",
    "since the initial work by @xcite , the extrasolar planetary census has grown by over an order of magnitude .",
    "we used the census of extrasolar planets contained in `` the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia '' @xcite .",
    "we used only the set of reasonably secure detections of planets around main - sequence stars as of  2003 july  1 .",
    "the total number of planets examined was 118 in  102 planetary systems .",
    "the required quantities for applying equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) are the planet s mass , distance from its primary , and rotation rate . at the time we extracted our list of planets from `` the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia , '' almost all of the known planets had been found via the radial velocity method .",
    "this method yields a lower limit to the planet s mass ( i.e. , @xmath35 )",
    ".    strictly , with the exception of the planets orbiting and , for which transits have been detected , the flux density levels that we calculate are lower limits . if the emitted radiation is nearly isotropic and assuming that the inclinations of the orbits are random , the typical error introduced is only a factor of  2 .",
    "there have been attempts to set upper limits on planetary masses , e.g. , using tidal constraints @xcite .",
    "we have not made use of these upper limits because in many cases they introduce additional uncertainties based on the characteristics of the host star ( e.g. , its age ) .",
    "the radial velocity method also determines the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the planet s orbit .",
    "we use the semi - major axis as the distance  @xmath14 in equation  ( [ eqn : rbl ] ) . for those planets in eccentric orbits",
    ", we might expect the radio emission to be periodic with the planet s orbital period , increasing near periastron and decreasing near apastron .",
    "the most extreme eccentricities in our sample are approximately 0.7 ( , , and ) .",
    "we therefore expect a range of possible flux densities of possibly 20 .",
    "for a planet with a more typical eccentricity , @xmath36 , the range is only a factor of  1.5 or so .",
    "we have no information on the rotation rates of these planets .",
    "we have therefore assumed that those planets with semi - major axes larger than 0.1  au have rotation rates equal to that of ( 10  hr ) , while those with semi - major axes less than 0.1  au are tidally - locked with rotation rates equal to their orbital periods @xcite .    for tidally - locked planets",
    "we have also assumed a radius of  1.25  @xmath37 in calculating the characteristic frequency .",
    "this value is both predicted based on the stellar insolation of such planets @xcite and is close to the observed value for the planet orbiting @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : list ] presents the full list of planets in our sample along with the expected emission frequencies and flux density levels .",

    "presently , the vlss is 10% complete , having surveyed a a 0.9  sr region . as an illustration of its future utility as well as to confront the models with what limited observations may be available , we have examined the locations of the known extrasolar planets within the current survey region .",

    "thus , the planet orbiting is similar to many of the other `` close - in '' planets , but its flux density is roughly 3 orders of magnitude lower than most of the other planets in the census because of its much greater distance ( 1500  pc vs.  a more typical 10  pc ) .",
    "this result is likely to be a general result as future planetary searches move deeper into the galaxy .",

    "most of the known extrasolar planets have expected emission frequencies below  1000  mhz . indeed ,",
    "if equation  ( [ eqn : fc ] ) is correct , we do not expect extrasolar planets to emit strongly above  1000  mhz because their magnetic moments are not large enough .",
    "thus , efforts to detect the radio emission from extrasolar planets must focus on the low - frequency capabilities of current or future radio telescopes .    in designing an experiment to detect extrasolar planets , the potential for bursts",
    "must be taken into account .",

    "in contrast , the magnetospheres of the solar system planets respond to solar wind variations on time scales of order 1  hr . we shall use 15  min .  as an integration time both to emphasize that long integration times may not be appropriate for estimating sensitivities and to allow for the possibility that shorter magnetosphere response times may occur .",
    "the very large array has been used already in attempts to detect radio emission from extrasolar planets @xcite , and as we illustrate here , its on - going 74  mhz northern sky survey provides an excellent opportunity to continue testing these models . below  1000  mhz , the vla operates at  74 and  330  mhz .",
    "its nominal sensitivity at these two frequencies is roughly @xmath92 and @xmath93 over bandwidths of  1.5 and  3  mhz , respectively . as figure",
    "[ fig : census ] demonstrates , only if the radiometric bode s law vastly underestimates the radiated power levels will the vla be able to detect radio emissions from extrasolar planets , even taking into account the possibility of strong bursts .",

    "its nominal sensitivity varies somewhat but is roughly @xmath94 in a 4-mhz bandwidth .",
    "although larger bandwidths ( and therefore improved sensitivities ) are technically possible with the gmrt , we use a 4-mhz bandwidth in an attempt to strike a balance between improved sensitivity and avoiding terrestrially - generated radio interference . as figure",
    "[ fig : census ] shows , most extrasolar planets are below the detection limit of the gmrt , unless they produce strong bursts ( factor of roughly 100 increase in flux density ) .    the low frequency array ( lofar ) is a radio telescope in the design and development phase that is expected to operate in the frequency range 10240  mhz .",
    "this frequency range encompasses the predicted emission frequencies of roughly two - thirds of the current census .",
    "the sensitivity of lofar will be highly frequency- and direction - dependent , due to the effect on the system temperature from the galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "for directions away from the galactic plane , the design goals specify a sensitivity , in a 15-min.integration with a 4-mhz bandwidth , around  2  mjy at the lower frequencies and increasing to around  1  mjy at the higher frequencies .",

    "perhaps most promising are , , and as these three objects may be detectable even in the absence of any flux density increase due to stellar wind variability . also of interest are and , which may require only moderate increases ( factor of  10 ) due to stellar wind variability to become detectable .",
    "the square kilometer array ( ska ) is a next - generation radio telescope that is expected to operate above  150  mhz .",

    "this sensitivity is sufficient that it should be capable of detecting the radio emissions from the most massive extrasolar planets , without relying upon bursts to enhance the emission levels , and a substantial fraction of the current census if their burst levels are comparable to what we find here .",
    "the efficacy of the ska in detecting the radio emission from extrasolar planets depends upon two aspects of its design , the lowest frequency at which it operates and its collecting area .",
    "first , if the potential ska frequency range were to be increased to extend below  150  mhz , the number of planets it potentially could detect would also increase .",
    "second , as stated currently , the ska sensitivity is specified in terms of a ratio between its effective collecting area and system temperature , @xmath96 .",
    "this quantity is taken to be constant .",
    "as @xmath97 increases below  1000  mhz due to galactic synchrotron emission , this design goal requires that @xmath98 also increase below  1000  mhz so as to keep the ratio constant . if this design goal is relaxed so that @xmath96 decreases below  1000  mhz , the likelihood of the ska detecting the radio emission from extrasolar planets also decreases .",
    "all of our discussions assume that the radio emissions from these planets would be driven solely by the stellar wind loading of the planets magnetospheres .",
    "if there are large , close - in satellites , like at , higher emission frequencies and flux densities could result . also , for planets in close to their parent stars , magnetic pressures that are large in the interior heliosphere may drive radio emission @xcite .",
    "future modeling efforts include integrating the current census with these hot jupiter emission models .",
    "we thank j.  schneider for his efforts in producing and maintaining `` the extrasolar planet encyclopedia , '' without which this project would have been considerably more arduous .",
    "basic research in radio astronomy at the nrl is supported by the office of naval research ."

    "<S> radio emission from these planets results from solar - wind powered electron currents depositing energy in the magnetic polar regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the known extrasolar planets should emit in the frequency range 101000  mhz and , under favorable circumstances , have typical flux densities as large as 1  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe an initial , systematic effort to search for radio emission in low radio frequency images acquired with the very large array . </S>",
    "<S> the limits set by the vla images ( @xmath0  mjy ) are consistent with , but do not provide strong constraints on , the predictions of the model . </S>",
    "<S> future radio telescopes , such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the square kilometer array ( ska ) , should be able to detect the known extrasolar planets or place austere limits on their radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> planets with masses much lower than those in the current census will probably radiate below  10  mhz and will require a space - based array . </S>"
