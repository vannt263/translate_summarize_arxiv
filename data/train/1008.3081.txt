    "although it has been recently postponed due to high cost and risks , nulling interferometry in space remains one of the very few direct detection methods able to characterize extrasolar planets and particularly telluric ones . within this framework ,",
    "several projects such as darwin@xcite , tpf - i@xcite , fksi@xcite or pegase@xcite have been proposed in the past years .",
    "most of them are based on a free flying concept .",
    "it allows firstly to avoid atmosphere turbulence , and secondly to distribute instrumental function over many satellites flying in close formation . in this way",
    ", a very high angular resolution can be achieved with an acceptable launch mass .",
    "but the price to pay is to very precisely position and stabilize relatively the spacecrafts , in order to achieve a deep and stable extinction of the star .",
    "understanding and mastering all these requirements are great challenges and key issues towards the feasibility of these missions .",
    "thus , we decided to experimentally study this question and focus on some possible simplifications of the concept .",
    "since 2006 , persee ( pegase experiment for research and stabilization of extreme extinction)@xcitelaboratory test bench is under development by a consortium composed of centre national detudes spatiales ( cnes ) , institut dastrophysique spatiale ( ias ) , observatoire de paris - meudon ( lesia ) , observatoire de la cte dazur ( oca ) , office national detudes et de recherches arospatiales ( onera ) , and thals alnia space ( tas ) .",
    "it is mainly funded by cnes r&d .",
    "persee couples an infrared wide band nulling interferometer with local opd and tip / tilt control loops and a free flying guidance navigation and control ( gnc ) simulator able to introduce realistic disturbances .",
    "although it was designed in the framework of the pegase free flying space mission , persee can adapt very easily to other contexts like fksi ( in space , with a 10 m long beam structure ) or aladdin@xcite ( on ground , in antarctica ) because the optical designs of all those missions are very similar .",
    "after a short description of the experimental setup , we will present first the results obtained in an intermediate configuration with monochromatic light .",
    "then , the key issue of filtering laboratory disturbances will be described in some details before presenting our very first and preliminary results with polychromatic light .",
    "this section provides the reader with a very brief description of persee .",
    "much more details can be obtained by the interested reader from ref@xcite .",
    "the goal of persee is not to reach the deepest possible nulling . starting from a state of the art nuller of the 2006 - 2007 period",
    ", it is an experimental attempt to better master the system flowdown of the nulling requirements both at payload ( instrument main optical bench ) and platform levels ( satellites ) .",
    "the balance of the constraints between those two levels is a key issue .",
    "the more disturbances the payload can face , the simpler the platforms are , the lower the cost .",
    "the general idea is hence to simplify as much as possible the global design and reduce the costs of a possible future space mission .",
    "the detailed objectives have been described in ref@xcite .",
    "our main requirement is to reach a @xmath2 nulling ratio in the [ 1.65 - 2.4 ]  band ( 40% spectral bandwidth ) with a @xmath3 stability over a 10  h time scale .",
    "another important requirement is to be able to find and stabilize fringes which have an initial drift speed ( as seen from the interferometer core ) up to 150  /s , as this can greatly simplify the relative metrology and control needs .",
    "we want to study and maximize the rejection of external disturbances introduced at relevant degrees of freedom of the optical setup by a disturbance module simulating various environments coming from the platform level .",
    "figure [ fig : setup ] gives an overview of the optical layout .",
    "the source module combines various light sources in order to simulate a star light in a wide spectral range .",
    "all sources are injected into single - mode fibers which outputs are grouped together at the focus of a collimator .",
    "the i channel ( [ 0.8 - 1 ]  ) is dedicated to the fringe sensor ( fs ) and the field relative angle sensor ( fras ) .",
    "the j channel ( [ 1 - 1.5 ]  ) is dedicated to the fs only .",
    "the nulling rate is measured in the k band ( [ 1.65 - 2.4 ]  ) .",
    "the 40  mm beams coming out of the separation module first encounter two 45fold mirrors ( m1 ) simulating siderostats .",
    "accurate calibrated perturbations can be introduced at this level either in tip / tilt ( few tens of mas resolution ) or opd ( nm resolution ) .",
    "the optical train incorporates then afocal systems with @xmath4 magnification to reduce the beam size down to about 13  mm .",
    "m4 mirrors deviate the beam toward the -z direction .",
    "coupled with the m1 mirrors , they create a `` field reversal '' achromatic phase shift between the two arms@xcite . following , each arm has a cat s eye delay line ( 50  mm stroke and 10  nm resolution ) and a 30active m6 mirror acting both in tip / tilt and fine opd ( 0.2  nm resolution ) .",
    "these active systems can all together generate various corrections covering the necessary range and resolution both in tip / tilt and opd .",
    "they are used in dedicated control loops which use the fras camera for the tip / tilt and the fs for the opd . l1 and l2 , located just before the combining stage , are an optional phase shift compensator .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      we did not perform a real nulling measurement with a stabilized opd in that configuration , but with the data obtained",
    ", we can estimate null depth to a few @xmath5 over the total wavelength range .",
    "this value is quite promising for future works , but need to be improved .",
    "the chromatic phase shift is the main error we will have to manage , using the phase shift compensator .",
    "that should greatly enhance the quality of the null depth .",
    "from existing data , we already can infer some general trends and first lessons . by instance , the current mmz design proved to have a 600  nm / k opd drift between science and fs channels .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon is due to standard mechanics used for supporting the optics and to instability of the mechanism driving the l3a plate .",
    "the optics ( caf2 ) form a nearly auto - compensated optical setup , as the refractive index variations almost compensate the thermoelastic and geometrical effects . an improved mmz with specially designed optical supports has been considered but could not be afforded in the frame of persee . with sufficient funding , a factor of at least 10",
    "could be saved .",
    "this leads to a differential opd sensitivity of about 50  nm / k .",
    "thus , the thermal stabilization need would be @xmath6  mk on a box of typically 30x30x10  cm size .",
    "the rest of the optical bench could be stabilized at 0.1  k or even 1  k ( the driving constraint there is in fact the thermal background in the measurement itself , not the mechanical stability ) .",
    "this seems quite affordable in space , even in non l2 orbits .",
    "the situation could even be improved by a clever use of the 4  mmz outputs which might help to correct the drift due to temperature at regular intervals . to conclude , for an intermediate mission like pegase , which is not requiring extreme cooling of the detector or the optics , an earth orbit is not totally ruled out , as first assumed in previous studies .",
    "this could be a great simplification as compared to a l2 mission , which remains nevertheless necessary for the final full mission .      with existing data",
    ", we can prove that cophasing two arms on ground at better than 1  nm  rms is feasible on a quite big optical setup in a standard building , but one has to take care to many details .",
    "by instance , electronics have to be implemented in an adjacent room to avoid unnecessary noise .",
    "the piezoelectric devices can not use their internal strain gauges which introduce too much electrical noise .",
    "the stiffness of the mechanical mounts supporting the optics has to be studied with care and a specification of at least 150  hz for the first mechanical mode seems to us a good rule . typically , on our bench",
    ", the mechanical modes of the optics mounts are located between 80 and 170  hz and react clearly to acoustic solicitations .",
    "the fs design using spatial modulation provides opd measurements with up to 1  khz sampling frequency which is extremely useful to implement an adequate compensation of microvibrations for both on ground and in flight perturbations .",
    "concerning filtering of mechanical perturbators on board a space mission , no experimental results are yet available , but the simulations give good hope that harmonic perturbations can be significantly reduced .",
    "this is a good step toward the feasibility of a satellite pointing system using by instance reaction wheels instead of more complex devices .      as far as fine pointing",
    "is concerned , a 60  mas stability can be reached at payload level , after the afocal systems .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath7 of a pixel with a psf spread over 4 to 5  pixels .",
    "it confirms that this point should not be a problem in the future , as expected . by instance , in the pegase case , the requirement is 600  mas in the same optical space , a factor of 10 higher .",
    "the use of piezoelectric devices within the payload relaxes the pointing requirements at platform level .",
    "the best solution is probably to use a spectral band near @xmath8 and collect an annular portion of light in some optic before the combining device , instead of using dichroic plates which would introduce chromatic aberrations and are more difficult to qualify for space use due to coating .",
    "the spacecraft requirements will be directly related to the piezoelectric angular stroke ( about @xmath9  arcsec mechanical , @xmath10  arcsec optical ) and the total angular magnification of the system ( 20 to 40 in the case of pegase , about 100 - 150 for darwin ) . in the pegase case",
    ", we can estimate that the required satellite pointing is about 10  arcsec ( residual bias after calibration and stabilization ) .",
    "although we did not reach our full objectives yet , we have already a lot of interesting data and very promising results . 1  nm opd control and 1% flux unbalance",
    "are nearly achieved .",
    "the best monochromatic null measured is @xmath11 at 2.32  . the wide band nulling is currently limited by chromatic effects . but this issue will be solved soon by the phase shift compensator .",
    "thus , we are quite confident that persee will be optimized before the end of 2010",
    ". then it will enter an exploitation phase where experiments will be carried out by various teams .",
    "this phase will be structured by a scientific group which will collect and sort proposals . at that point",
    ", the use of persee will be open to international teams ."
