    "it is reasonable to regard the disc as an axisymmetric configuration in which , to a first approximation , material orbits in circlar keplerian orbits .",
    "however , other weaker forces due to internal pressure , viscosity , or magnetic fields may also operate in the disc . these can result in angular momentum redistribution on a long timescale . in order to flow inwards , material has to transport its angular momentum outwards to matter at larger radii .",
    "the angular momentum transport process determines the timescale on which mass accretion can occur and hence the evolutionary timescale of the disc .    historically , the first angular momentum transport mechanism to be considered was through the action of viscosity ( von weizscker 1948 ) .",
    "this acts through the friction of neighbouring sections of the disc upon each other .",
    "the inner regions rotate faster than the outer regions and thus viscous friction tends to communicate angular momentum from the inner parts of the disc to the outer parts . in order to result in evolution on astronomically interesting timescales ,",
    "it is necessary to suppose that an anomalously large viscosity is produced through the action of some sort of turbulence .",
    "the magnitude of the viscosity is usually parameterized through the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) @xmath63 prescription .    in this",
    "we suppose the kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath64 where @xmath63 is a dimensionless constant which must be less than unity .",
    "currently the most likely mechanism for producing turbulence is through hydromagnetic instabilities ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) which might produce @xmath65 provided the disc has adequate ionization .    gammie ( 1996 ) has proposed a model in which viscosity only operates in the surface layers where external sources of ionization such as cosmic rays can penetrate .",
    "such layered models may have an interior dead zone of material for @xmath66  au and , although they can be considered as models with a variable @xmath67 they will behave somewhat differently from the standard models considered here which have @xmath63 assumed to be constant throughout .",
    "the evolution of a viscous disc is controlled by angular momentum conservation .",
    "the conservation of specific angular momentum may be expressed in the form ( eg .",
    "papaloizou & lin 1995 )    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the angular momentum flux , with the vertical coordinate being denoted by @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the mass density .",
    "the process of vertical averaging applied to equation  ( [ cons ] ) in the case of a keplerian disc yields    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the radial velocity in the disc and @xmath74 is the surface mass density . the vertical average for a quantity @xmath75",
    "is defined by @xmath76    we assume @xmath77 vanishes on the disc boundaries ensuring that the total angular momentum of the disc is conserved .",
    "we comment that this implies that angular momentum loss through winds or gain through mass infall is neglected .",
    "the radial angular momentum flux arising from viscosity is given by    @xmath78    and thus    @xmath79    for a keplerian disc the angular velocity decreases outwards so that the angular momentum flux is directed outwards as required in order that mass accretion may occur .",
    "using equation  ( [ flu ] ) in equation  ( [ ave ] ) and solving for @xmath80 gives @xmath81 for a keplerian disc in which @xmath82 we get    @xmath83    thus the radial velocity in the disc is determined in terms of the kinematic viscosity . for a steady state disc",
    "in which @xmath84 is constant , we find @xmath85 this velocity is negative , consistent with accretion onto the central object .    to obtain a general equation governing the disc , the velocity  ( [ vrad ] ) is used together with the vertically averaged continuity equation @xmath86    the global evolution of the disc is thus found to be governed by a single diffusion equation for the surface density which takes the form ( lynden  bell & pringle 1974 )    @xmath87    according to this the characteristic evolution timescale for the disc will be the global diffusion timescale .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath88 and , adopting a characteristic radius @xmath89 the global diffusion timescale is @xmath90    for viscosity coefficient @xmath91 parameterized through the @xmath63 prescription so that @xmath92 we obtain @xmath93    for a protostellar disc of size @xmath94  au with @xmath95 and a central solar mass , we find @xmath96  yr .",
    "this gives lifetimes comparable to those estimated for discs around t tauri stars if @xmath97@xmath98    equation  ( [ aa4 ] ) enables the evolution of the disc to be determined if @xmath99 is specified as a function of @xmath100 this can be done by solving for the vertical structure of the disc .",

    "however , we shall limit our calculations presented below to cases with constant @xmath63 . with this formalism ,",
    "equation  ( [ dfdz1 ] ) becomes :    @xmath117      we have to solve three first order ordinary differential equations for the three variables @xmath103 , @xmath105 ( or equivalently @xmath71 ) , and @xmath106 as a function of @xmath70 at a given radius @xmath118 accordingly , we need three boundary conditions at each @xmath2 .",
    "we shall denote with a subscript @xmath119 values at the disk surface .",
    "the first boundary condition is obtained by integrating equation  ( [ dfdz1 ] ) over @xmath70 between @xmath120 and @xmath46 . since by symmetry",

    "the second boundary condition is determined by the fact that very close to the surface of the disc , since the optical depth @xmath125 above the disc is small , we have :    @xmath126    this condition is familiar in stellar structure ( e.g. schwarzschild 1958 ) . using @xmath127 we thus obtain @xmath128 provided @xmath129 the results do not depend on the value of @xmath125 we choose ( see below ) .",
    "the third boundary condition we use is    @xmath130    here the disc is assumed immersed in a medium with background temperature @xmath131 the surface opacity @xmath132 in general depends on @xmath133 and @xmath134 and we have used @xmath135 .",

    "this has contributions from dust grains , molecules , atoms and ions .",
    "it is written in the form @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 vary with temperature .",
    "the equations are integrated using a fifth  order runge ",
    "kutta method with adaptive step length ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) . for a specified @xmath143",
    "we determine the value of @xmath144 the vertical height of the disc surface .",
    "this is done iteratively .",
    "starting from an estimated value of @xmath144 after satisfying the surface boundary conditions , the equations are integrated down to the mid  plane @xmath145 the condition that @xmath146 at @xmath147 will not in general be satisfied .",
    "an iteration procedure ( e.g. the newton  raphson method ) is used to adjust value of @xmath46 until @xmath148 at @xmath147 to a specified accuracy .    an important point to note",
    "is that as well as finding the disc structure , we also determine the surface density @xmath149 for a given @xmath150 thus a @xmath151 relation is derived .    in the calculations presented here ,",
    "we have taken the optical depth of the atmosphere above the disk surface @xmath152 and a background temperature @xmath153  k. in these calculations the temperatures are lower than about 4,000  k , so that , at the densities we consider , hydrogen is not dissociated and the mean molecular weight @xmath113 .    in the optically thick regions of the disk ,",
    "the value of @xmath46 is independent of the value of @xmath125 we choose .",
    "however , this is not the case in optically thin regions where we find that , as expected , the smaller @xmath154 the larger @xmath155 however , this dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath125 has no physical significance , since in all cases , the mass is concentrated towards the disk mid  plane in a layer with thickness independent of @xmath156    for example , for @xmath157  m@xmath30  yr@xmath18 and @xmath158 , we find , at @xmath159  au , that @xmath160 and 0.24 for @xmath152 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "however , in both cases , the surface density , the optical thickness and the mid  plane temperature are the same . only the mid  plane pressure varies slightly ( by about 30% ) between these cases .    in figures  [ fig1]a  c , we plot @xmath162 , @xmath149 and the mid  plane temperature @xmath163 versus @xmath2 for @xmath124 between @xmath164 and @xmath165  m@xmath30/year ( assuming this quantity is the same at all radii , i.e. the disk is in a steady state ) and for illustrative purposes we have adopted @xmath166 .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a indicates that the outer parts of the disk are shielded from the radiation of the central star by the inner parts .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of lin & papaloizou ( 1980 ) and bell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . for @xmath166 ,",
    "the radius beyond which the disk is not illuminated by the central star varies from 0.2  au to about 3  au when @xmath124 goes from @xmath164 to @xmath165  m@xmath30  yr@xmath18 .",
    "these values of the radius move to 0.1 and 2  au when @xmath158 .",
    "since reprocessing of the stellar radiation by the disk is not an important heating factor below these radii , this process will in general not be important in protostellar disks .",
    "we note that this result is independent of the value of @xmath125 we have taken .",
    "indeed , as we pointed out above , only the thickness of the optically thin parts of the disk ( which do not reprocess any radiation ) gets larger when @xmath125 is decreased .",
    "the values of @xmath162 , @xmath149 and @xmath163 we get are qualitatively similar to those obtained by lin & papaloizou ( 1980 ) , who adopted a prescription for viscosity based on convection , and bell et al .",
    "our values of @xmath162 are somewhat larger though , since @xmath46 is measured from the disk mid  plane to the surface such that @xmath125 is small , and not 2/3 as usually assumed .",
    "however , as we commented above , this has no effect on the other physical quantities .",
    "we also recall that @xmath144 as defined here , is about 23 times larger than @xmath167 with @xmath114 being the mid  plane sound speed , which is often used to define the disc semi  thickness .",
    "we determine the evolution of the radial structure of a non  steady @xmath63disk by solving the diffusion equation ( [ aa4 ] ) . to do this , we need to use the relation between @xmath168 and @xmath149 at each radius .",
    "interpolation of or piece  wise power law fits to numerical data may be used to represent this relation and more details of these will be published elsewhere .",
    "we note that they can be used either to compute @xmath149 from @xmath124 or @xmath124 from @xmath100    in figures  [ fig2]a  b we plot both the curves @xmath169 that we get from the vertical structure integrations as described above and those obtained from piece  wise power law fits .",
    "figures  [ fig2]a and  [ fig2]b are for @xmath158 and @xmath170 , respectively . in each case",
    "the radius varies between 0.01 and 100  au .",
    "if we calculate @xmath124 using the fits with @xmath149 as an input parameter , the average error is 22 , 18 , 13% and the maximum error is 55 , 48 , 42% for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "we see that the fits give a good approximation .    using the @xmath173 relation derived from the integrations , we solved equation  ( [ aa4 ] ) using explicit finite difference techniques .",
    "we considered the situation of a disc with initially @xmath174  m@xmath30 for which @xmath175 extending to 100  au .",
    "the central star had @xmath176  m@xmath30 and for illustrative purposes we adopted @xmath177    in figure  [ fig3 ] we show the evolution of @xmath149 as a function of time .",
    "after a time @xmath178  yr , the @xmath149 profile resembles that of a steady disc in the inner parts justifying the assumption of a steady state disc model . after this time",
    ", the model is similar to that assumed for the primordial solar nebula with @xmath179  g  @xmath180 at 5  au .",
    "it is thought that planetesimals can be built up from @xmath181 sized particles through processes of collision , sticking and accumulation occurring in a gaseous medium with some degree of turbulence ( see the review by weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) .",
    "if physical parameters are favourable , particles with a size distribution ranging up to @xmath182  a few km can be produced on timescales on the order of @xmath183  yr at 1au .",
    "the efficiency of these processes are very uncertain depending as they do on sticking probabilities and the degree of particle settling in a turbulent medium etc .",
    "planetesimal formation efficiency may be a function of the nebula location , being more effective beyond a few au , where ice has condensed .",
    "here we assume that planetesimals with mass @xmath184  g may form on a sufficiently rapid timescale anywhere in the nebula .",
    "we suppose the planetesimals have number distribution @xmath185 for some index @xmath186 here the number of planetesimals in the mass range @xmath187 is @xmath188 then most of the mass is distributed in the most / least massive objects according as @xmath189 or @xmath190 the surface density of matter in the form of planetesimals is @xmath191 the characteristic number density , @xmath192 for characteristic mass @xmath193 is then @xmath194 here @xmath195 is the scale height of the distribution @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the root mean square velocity dispersion .    for the typical values , @xmath198  g  @xmath199 @xmath200  g , and @xmath201  cm ,",
    "the mean distance between planetesimals is @xmath202  cm .",
    "this suggests use of a local box model ( e.g. stewart & wetherill 1988 ) . in this box",
    ", the centre of which is in circular orbit with the local keplerian angular velocity , planetesimals are assumed to move between encounters with constant velocity . in this respect , the effect of the central mass is ignored , and the planetesimals are treated using the methods of kinetic theory . the idea ( safronov 1966 ) is that the velocity dispersion of the planetesimals is increased by gravitational scattering , enhancing direct collisions between them through which they accumulate and grow .",
    "the local box model fails when the largest planetesimals become isolated .",
    "that happens when accumulation has reached the stage where there are so few that they are in non  overlapping near circular orbits such that they can not perturb similar mass objects in neighbouring orbits into collision . in this situation",
    "the central mass can no longer be neglected . to get an approximate idea of when isolation occurs at radius @xmath89",
    "equate @xmath203 this is a statement that there is one object in an annulus of width equal to four times its roche lobe size .",
    "then @xmath204 this gives @xmath205  g at 5  au for @xmath198  g  @xmath180 and @xmath206  m@xmath30 with obvious scalings to other surface densities and radii .",
    "thus on the order of 1  m@xmath207 may be obtained at 5au .",
    "this argument assumes circular orbits which is probably reasonable for the largest objects which are circularized through dynamical friction . after the isolation stage , planetesimal evolution is probably best followed by global n  body methods ( e.g. aarseth et al .",
    "1993 ) . in the gas free case",
    "the ultimate result is expected to be the formation of terrestrial planets .      for a member of a swarm of equal masses interacting gravitationally ,",
    "the cross section for elastic scattering is on average larger than that for a direct collision , so long as the velocity dispersion is less than the escape velocity .",
    "thus when the velocity dispersion of the swarm is initially small , it will increase because of the effect of elastic scatterings .    the interaction radius for two masses @xmath193 to give significant scattering is @xmath208 the time between encounters is then @xmath209 here the @xmath210 term accounts for more distant collisions ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . using the above , one gets @xmath211 for @xmath212  g , @xmath198  g  @xmath180 and @xmath206  m@xmath30 , one finds at 1  au that @xmath213  yr .",
    "note that @xmath195 is small because the planetesimal dispersion velocities are expected to reach the escape velocity for the characteristic mass at a maximum .",
    "at this point inelastic physical impacts become as important as scattering and damp the random motions . then for @xmath212  g , @xmath214  cm  s@xmath18 , @xmath215 and @xmath216  yr at 1  au .",
    "thus early planetesimal build up occurs on a rapid timescale .      from the above arguments , the collision time of @xmath193 with @xmath217 is inversely proportional to @xmath218",
    "if this does not decrease with @xmath217 , then collisions with larger masses are dominant and we expect velocity dispersions to build up to the escape velocity of the largest body ( safronov 1966 ) .",
    "this occurs for @xmath219    for @xmath220 the largest bodies collide with predominantly smaller ones and are circularized by dynamical friction .",
    "they can then accrete efficiently from the smaller ones which move with a velocity dispersion small compared to the escape velocity from them .",
    "the accretion rate from planetesimals with mass @xmath217 and velocity dispersion @xmath221 is enhanced by gravitational focusing .",
    "thus the growth of the largest mass @xmath193 say , with radius @xmath222 is given by    @xmath223 runaway is caused both by the increase of @xmath222 with @xmath193 and the gravitational focusing term in brackets .",
    "the timescale for growth to isolation mass is comparable to the encounter time , @xmath224 indicated above .",
    "but note that growth may be slowed down through the effect of encounters between neighbouring runaways producing an increase in the velocity dispersion that propagates to all components of the system ( ida & makino 1993 )",
    "after a solid protoplanetary core grows to a critical mass of around a few @xmath225 the surrounding gaseous atmosphere can no longer grow quasi  statically in mass along with it . a process of collapse ensues possibly leading to dynamical accretion and mass growth to values characteristic of giant planets .",
    "we review the theory of this below .",
    "such a critical core mass model is supported by the indication from models of jupiter that it has a solid core of @xmath226@xmath227  m@xmath207 ( podolak et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
