    "statistical qcd predicts the existence of new states of matter at high temperature @xmath1 and high baryon number densities @xmath2 ( baryochemical potential ) .",
    "the phase diagram is schematically represented in fig .  1 .",
    "let us discuss first the phase transition at high @xmath1 and small @xmath2 ( i.e. when baryon and antibaryon densities are approximately equal ) . at @xmath3 ,",
    "lattice calculations @xcite show a phase transition to a deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) at a critical temperature @xmath4  mev , corresponding to an energy density @xmath5  an order of magnitude higher than that of ordinary nuclear matter ( @xmath6  mev/@xmath7 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "below the critical temperature @xmath8 , we heat the system and the temperature increases towards @xmath8 . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the temperature remains constant ( the energy given to the system is used to increase its latent heat ) and the energy density @xmath5 increases sharply . for @xmath10",
    "the temperature increases again with @xmath11 approximately constant , as it should be for an ideal gas ( stefan - boltzmann limit ) .",
    "the sharp increase of @xmath11 near @xmath8 is due to the increase in the number of degrees of freedom of the system from a hadronic phase ( @xmath12 ) to a plasma of quarks and gluons ( @xmath10 ) .    in the ideal case of pure gauge qcd ( the so - called `` quenched '' approximation in which dynamical quarks are absent )",
    "the phase transition is first order . in the presence of dynamical quarks",
    "the situation is more complicated and the order of the phase transition depends on the number of flavors .",
    "a restoration of chiral symmetry also takes place at the same @xmath8 .",
    "the region @xmath13 studied in lattice qcd corresponds to the conditions in high - energy heavy ion collisions at mid - rapidities .",
    "it also corresponds to the conditions in the primordial universe . in the opposite conditions ,",
    "i.e. low temperature and high baryon densities ( i.e. the conditions at the center of neutron stars ) a new phase ( or phases ) is expected @xcite producing a color superconductor in which pairs of quarks condensate  in a way similar to electron ( cooper ) pairs in qed .",
    "a possibility to create in the laboratory the high energy densities and temperatures required for the production of qgp is via head - on heavy ion collisions at high energy . in @xmath14 collisions",
    ", the energy density can be evaluated using the bjorken formula    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the number of produced hadrons per unit rapidity and @xmath17 is their average energy .",
    "@xmath18 is the nuclear radius and @xmath19 an average formation time .",
    "taking the customary value @xmath20  fm , we obtain for central @xmath21 @xmath21 collisions at rhic an energy density @xmath22  gev/@xmath7 , which appears to be high enough for qgp production .",
    "does it mean that qgp production in high - energy heavy ion collisions follows from qcd  ?",
    "the answer is negative . indeed ,",
    "qgp formation is predicted by statistical qcd , i.e. qcd applied to a system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , one of the main issues in heavy ion physics is to determine whether the produced final state reaches thermal equilibrium .",
    "this depends , of course , on the strength and time duration of the final state interaction and can only be decided with the help of experiment .",
    "the observables which provide the most reliable information are the so - called signals of qgp . in this lecture",
    "i will discuss two of the most important signals  : the particle abundance ( in particular , hyperon and antihyperon production ) and the @xmath23 suppression .",
    "the latter could be due to the deconfinement or `` melting '' of the @xmath24 bound state in the plasma @xcite .",
    "however , a similar phenomenon is observed in @xmath25 collisions , where the produced densities are too small for qgp formation . as for the former ,",
    "an argument in favor of equilibrium is the fact that particle abundances are well described using statistical models @xcite .",
    "moreover , these models provide a natural explanation @xcite of the increase of the relative yields of strange particles in central nucleus - nucleus as compared to @xmath26 collisions ( strangeness enhancement ) .",
    "however , one should take into account that these models are also very successful @xcite in @xmath26 and even in @xmath27 interactions , where qgp is not produced .",
    "therefore , it is important to study these observables in the framework of microscopic models which are successful in describing @xmath26 and @xmath25 interactions and can be generalized to heavy ion collisions",
    ". models of this type [ 7 - 10 ] are called string models , in which particle production takes place in the form of strings ( chromo - electric flux tubes ) stretched between constituents of complementary color charge . in qcd ,",
    "the force between complementary color charges ( such as a quark and an antiquark of same color ) , are small at distances smaller than the hadron radius . however , at larger distances , the potential of the chromo - electric field increases linearly with the distance ( confinement ) . due to the strong force generated by this potential",
    "it is not possible to isolate the two color charges .",
    "indeed , in the attempt to separate them , the potential energy of the system increases very rapidly and is converted into mass via the creation of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "this results in the production of hadrons ( mostly mesons ) , formed by recombination of a quark and an antiquark of adjacent pairs .",
    "the lines of force of the chromo - electric field are strongly colimated along the axis determined by the two color charges .",
    "hence the string - like or jet - like shape of the set of produced hadrons .    as a starting point",
    ", one usualy assumes in these models that particles produced in different strings are independent . in this case thermal equilibrium",
    "can not be reached , no matter how large the energy density is .",
    "indeed , in this case a large energy - density is the result of piling up a large number of independent strings .",
    "in other words , some `` cross - talk '' between different strings is needed in order to thermalize the system .    the assumption of independence of strings works remarkably well in @xmath28 and @xmath29 interactions [ 7 - 10 ]  even in the case of event samples with 5 or 6 times the average multiplicity  indicating that no sizable final state interaction is present in these reactions .",
    "however , it is clear that in heavy ion collisions , where several strings occupy a transverse area of 1 @xmath30 , the assumption of string independence has to break down .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "as we shall see , some data can not be described without final state interaction .",
    "it could have happened that this final state interaction is so strong that the string picture breaks down and becomes totally useless .",
    "this does not seem to be the case . on the contrary",
    ", present data can be described using the particle densities computed in the model as initial conditions in the gain and loss ( transport ) equations governing the final state interaction .",
    "the interaction cross - section turns out to be small ( a few tenths of a mb ) . due to this smallness and to the limited interaction time",
    "available , final state interaction has an important effect only on rare processes , in particular @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath23 production , or particle yields at large @xmath33 .",
    "the bulk of the final state is not affected .",
    "the plan of these lectures is as follows  : in section [ sec:2 ] , i introduce the general framework of high - energy scattering in a hadronic language with special emphasis on the unitarity condition and its implementation in eikonal and glauber models .",
    "this section contains also some rudiments of regge poles and the concept of pomeron . in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "i introduce a microscopic model  : the dual parton model ( dpm ) and compute the charged particle multiplicities as a function of energy and centrality ( the latter characterizes the impact parameter of the collision in a way which is experimentally measurable ) . in section [ sec:4",
    "] , i study the so - called stopping power , i.e. the fate of the nucleons of the colliding nuclei . particle abundances are studied in section [ sec:5 ] and @xmath23 suppression in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "section [ sec:7 ] contains the conclusions .",
    "an important property of strong interactions is the unitarity of the @xmath34 matrix operator    @xmath35    the @xmath34 matrix is the operator that transforms free states at time @xmath36 into free states at times @xmath37 .",
    "if we write    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the transition amplitude between free states @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the unitarity condition ( [ 1e ] ) reads    @xmath42    here @xmath43 denotes any state that can be reached from both @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for @xmath40",
    "identical to @xmath41 , eq . ( [ 3e ] ) reduces to    @xmath44    a two body amplitude @xmath45 depends on two independent variables  :    @xmath46    with @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath40 and @xmath41 are identical , @xmath48 . since the sum in the r.h.s . of ( [ 4e ] ) builds up the total @xmath49 cross - sections , we obtain from ( [ 4e ] ) the optical theorem , which relates the total cross - section to the forward ( @xmath48 ) imaginary part of the elastic amplitude @xmath50    @xmath51    let us now examine some of the implications of the unitarity condition ( [ 4e ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to separate the states @xmath43 into two classes .",
    "the first class consists of all inelastic states containing no large rapidity gap between the produced particles .",
    "the second class consists of those events with at least one large rapidity gap .",
    "obviously , elastic scattering produces a state of the second class .",
    "we know experimentally that the first class of events gives the most important contribution to the total cross - section .",
    "it is convenient to depict such a contribution in the form of a diagram as shown in fig",
    "( its interpretation will be discussed below ) .",
    "the important point is that the final state in fig .",
    "3a has also to be included as intermediate state in 4 .",
    "this is precisely the contribution of the elastic state which , as discussed above , belongs to the second class of intermediate states .",
    "one obtains in this way the diagram shown in fig .",
    "the lines with a cross denote the contribution of the on - shell initial state to the elastic amplitude .",
    "repeating such an iteration , one is led to the multiple scattering diagram depicted in fig .",
    "one has to add up all the diagrams in figs .",
    "3 . in fact ,",
    "inelastic states ( for instance @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the case of @xmath26 scattering ) also contribute as intermediate states , so that the vertex function ( blob ) of the diagrams in fig . 3b and 3c can be quite complicated .",
    "there are also contributions due to intermediate states @xmath43 containing more than one rapidity gap . however , their contributions are small at present energies and will not be considered here .    the interpretation of the diagram in fig .",
    "3a originates from the claim that the inelastic intermediate states ( without rapidity gap ) generate a regge pole called the pomeron ( see section [ subsec5 ] ) .",
    "all diagrams can be treated as feynman diagrams in a field theory called reggeon field theory or gribov s reggeon calculus @xcite . when only the diagrams in figs .",
    "3 are kept , one obtains , as a particular case , the so - called eikonal model for hadron - hadron scatttering or the glauber model in interactions involving nuclei .      in the case of hadron - hadron interactions the diagram in fig .",
    "3a ( pomeron ) is also called the born term .",
    "its contribution to the total cross - section is parametrized in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 are coupling constants and @xmath56 a parameter ( see section [ subsec5 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath26 scattering and let us assume for simplicity an exponential dependence , in @xmath57 , i.e.    @xmath58    in this case , all loop integrals in figs .",
    "3b and 3c can be performed analytically . at a given @xmath59",
    "there are only two free parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which can be determined from the experimental values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( or from @xmath62 and the slope of the elastic amplitude ) . for @xmath59 variable",
    "there is a third parameter @xmath56 , and the values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 at several energies can be described in this way .",
    "a contribution to the total cross - section in @xmath64 with @xmath65 violates the froissard bound @xcite ( consequence of unitarity ) .",
    "note that @xmath66 is needed in order to describe the rise with energy of @xmath62 .",
    "however , when all multiple scattering terms are added , one obtains , at high energy , @xmath67 , i.e. the maximal increase with @xmath59 allowed by the froissard bound .",
    "it is convenient to work in the impact parameter @xmath68 representation .",
    "the scattering amplitude in @xmath41-space is defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 . using this transformation it is easy to see that at fixed @xmath41 the contribution of a diagram involving @xmath43 exchanges ( fig .",
    "3c ) is just the @xmath43-th power of the born term ( fig .  3a ) times some trivial combinatorial factors .",
    "furthermore the sum over @xmath43 has a simple expression ( see below , footnote 1 ) .",
    "all these features will now be described in detail in the case of the glauber model .",
    "let us consider , for definiteness , a proton - nucleus ( @xmath25 ) scattering .",
    "in this case there are no free parameters involved .",
    "indeed , the @xmath57-dependence ( or @xmath41-dependence ) of the proton vertex function can be neglected in comparison with the fast variation of the nuclear one .",
    "the latter is known from the nuclear density . moreover , in this case the born term at @xmath48 is just the inelastic proton - nucleon cross - section , which is known experimentally .",
    "the main formula of the probabilistic glauber model is the one that gives the cross - section @xmath71 for @xmath43 inelastic collisions of the projectile with @xmath43 nucleons of the target nucleus ( the remaining @xmath72 nucleon which do not participate in the interaction are called spectators ) , at fixed impact parameter @xmath41  :    @xmath73    here @xmath74 is the proton - nucleon inelastic cross - section and @xmath75 is the nuclear profile function ( obtained by integrating the nuclear density  : @xmath76  ; @xmath77 ) .",
    "equation ( [ 8e ] ) is just the bernoulli s formula for composite probabilities .",
    "the first factor is a trivial combinatorial factor corresponding to the different ways of choosing @xmath43 nucleons out of @xmath78 .",
    "the second one gives the probability of having @xmath43 inelastic @xmath79 collisions at given @xmath41 .",
    "the third one is the probability that the remaining @xmath72 nucleons do not interact inelastically .",
    "let us consider first a term with two collisions both of which are inelastic .",
    "the corresponding cross - section is @xmath80 i.e. a positive term .",
    "let us now consider the case of two collisions only one of which is inelastic .",
    "the corresponding ( interference ) term is @xmath81 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) by putting @xmath82 and taking the second term in the expansion of the last factor .",
    "we get @xmath83 .",
    "we see that @xmath84 .",
    "thus , a rescattering term containing two collisions gives a negative contribution to the total @xmath25 cross - section .",
    "let us now consider their contributions to @xmath85 .",
    "they are given by @xmath86 .",
    "indeed , in the case of a double inelastic collision , the triggered particle can be emitted in either of them  hence an extra factor 2 .",
    "we see , in this way that the different contributions to @xmath87 of a double scattering diagram cancel .",
    "it is easy to see that this cancellation is valid order by order in the total number of collisions .",
    "this can also be seen as follows .",
    "the total inelastic cross - section for @xmath25 collision in the glauber model is given by the well known expression ) , namely @xmath88 in this case we get @xmath89 , which coincides with eq .",
    "( [ 9e ] ) in the large @xmath78 limit .",
    "the same type of expressions are obtained in the eikonal model , since , in this case , the number of rescatterings is infinite . ]",
    "@xmath90    this expression contains a term in @xmath91 ( single - scattering or born term ) .",
    "it also contains contribution from multiple scattering with alternate signs ( shadowing corrections ) .",
    "numerically , it behaves as @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "the single particle inclusive cross - section is given by    @xmath94    we see that here multiple - scattering contributions cancel identically and only the born term is left ( impulse approximation ) . as a consequence of this cancellation the @xmath78-dependence of @xmath87 in @xmath25 interactions behaves as @xmath91 . in the case of @xmath95 collisions",
    "it behaves as @xmath95 and @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath97 , i.e. to the number of binary collisions  rather than to the number of participants , as one would naively expect ( see section [ subsec3.2 ] ) .",
    "the interest of this way of looking at the glauber model resides in the fact that , as discussed in section [ subsec2 ] , it provides strict relations between contributions to the total cross - section and contributions to various inelastic processes of multiparticle production , which make up the total cross - section via unitarity .",
    "these relations are the so - called abramovsky - gribov - kancheli ( agk ) cutting rules @xcite , and have a general validity in rft .",
    "the absence of shadowing corrections in the inclusive cross - section , eq .",
    "( [ 10e ] ) , is called the agk cancellation . as mentionned above , in the eikonal and glauber models",
    "only the initial state is present in the vertex function ( blob ) .",
    "thus a secondary can only be produced in an interaction and the agk cancellation is exact . in a general theory with a more complicated vertex function",
    ", the triggered particle can be produced in the blob .",
    "this gives rise to a violation of the agk cancellation  which is responsible for the shadowing corrections to the inclusive spectra .",
    "indeed , if the measured particle ( trigger ) is produced in the vertex function of a double scattering diagram , the extra factor 2 in @xmath98 is not present and the agk cancellation is not valid . in this case",
    "the shadowing corrections in the inclusive cross - section are the same as in the total cross - section .",
    "this is the physical origin of the agk violations present in the microscopic model described in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "it is clear that if the blob has a small extension in rapidity , production from the blob will mainly contribute to the fragmentation region .",
    "therefore , at mid - rapidities , and large energy , the agk cancellation will be valid .",
    "let us consider next the contribution to the total cross - section resulting from the diffractive production of large mass states .",
    "clearly , this is equivalent to an increase of the rapidity extension of the blob  which , in this case , can cover the mid - rapidity region .",
    "therefore , shadowing corrections to the single particle inclusive cross - section can be present , at mid - rapidities , provided the measured particle is part of the diffractively produced system .",
    "we see in this way that shadowing corrections to @xmath87 are related to diffractive production of large mass systems .",
    "the theoretical expression of the diffractive cross - section is well - known .",
    "it has also been measured experimentally and , thus , the shadowing corrections can be computed with no free parameters . in these lectures",
    "i will not elaborate any further on this last point .",
    "more details , as well as numerical calculations , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the reggeon calculus or reggeon field theory ( rft ) @xcite provides the field theoretical formulation of the eikonal ( for @xmath28 collisions ) or the glauber ( for @xmath29 and @xmath95 ) models , valid at high energies .",
    "the main difference between the rft and the glauber model is that , at high energies , the coherence length is large and the whole nucleus is involved in the interaction .",
    "moreover , due to the space - time development of the interaction , when , at high energy , a projectile interacts inelastically with a nucleon of the nucleus , the formation time of ( most of ) the produced particles is larger than the nuclear size and , thus , most particles are produced outside the nucleus .",
    "only slow particles in the lab reference frame are produced inside the nucleus and can interact with the nucleons of the nucleus they meet in their path ( intra - nuclear cascade ) . at high energies ,",
    "most of the produced particles have left the nucleus at the time they are formed .",
    "this near absence of nuclear cascade is well known experimentally .",
    "actually , it constituted for a long time one of the main puzzles of high energy hadron - nuclear interactions .",
    "another consequence of the space - time development of the interaction , is that planar multiple - scattering diagrams give a vanishing contribution to the total cross - section at high energies . indeed , as discussed above , the formation time of the multiparticle state is larger than the nuclear size and , therefore , there is no time for its rescattering with other nucleons of the nucleus .",
    "the relevant multiple scattering diagrams are non - planar ones , describing the `` parallel '' interactions of different constituents of the projectile with the target nucleons ( in the case of an @xmath29 collision ) .",
    "this picture is in clear contrast with the glauber model , in which the projectile undergoes successive ( billiard ball type of ) collisions with the nucleons of the target .    in spite of these differences ,",
    "one recovers the glauber formula in first approximation .",
    "as discussed above , this formula corresponds to the contribution of the initial state ( on - shell projectile pole ) to the various rescattering terms . in rft one",
    "has , besides these contributions , also the contributions due to low mass and high mass diffractive excitations of the projectile .",
    "the latter are very important since , as we have seen in section [ subsec3 ] , they give rise to shadowing corrections to the inclusive cross - section .",
    "regge poles @xcite @xcite play an important role in high - energy interactions .",
    "it is important to give some basic concepts on regge poles .",
    "indeed , they provide a theoretical basis for the parametrization of the born term in multiple - scattering models .",
    "more precisely , they give an important connection between high - energy behaviour and the spectrum of resonances in the @xmath57-channel .",
    "also , it is very important for our purpose in these lectures that they allow to determine , to a large extent , the momentum distribution functions of partons in hadrons , as well as their fragmentation functions .",
    "these are the main ingredients of the microscopic models introduced in the next section .    at high energies",
    "the exchange of a particle of spin @xmath99 and mass @xmath100 in the @xmath57-channel of a two - body amplitude @xmath45 has the form    @xmath101    when @xmath99 is large ( @xmath102 ) , the cross - section increases as a power @xmath103 and violates the froissart bound .",
    "this problem provided one of the main motivations for the introduction of regge poles .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ 11e ] ) is valid only close to the pole , i.e. for @xmath104 .",
    "however , the physical values of @xmath57 for the @xmath59-channel amplitude @xmath45 are @xmath105 . in the regge pole model ,",
    "the behaviour ( [ 11e ] ) is modified for physical values of @xmath57 , as follows    @xmath106    here @xmath107 are called regge residues and @xmath108 is a function , called regge trajectory , such that @xmath109 .",
    "thus , if @xmath110 for physical values of @xmath57 , the froissard bound will be satisfied , irrespective of the value of @xmath99 . for practical purposes one proceeds as follows .",
    "let us consider the existing particles and/or resonances with the conserved quantum numbers ( isospin , parity etc ) of the @xmath57-channel .",
    "for each of them , let us plot its spin versus its mass ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "this is the so - called chew - frautschi plot @xcite .",
    "( actually , in a relativistic theory it is necessary to consider separately even and odd values of spin ) .",
    "it turns out that a large family of resonances , including @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 lie practically in a single straight line @xmath115 .",
    "other resonances as @xmath116 and @xmath117 lie on parallel regge trajectories with @xmath118 . extrapolating to the physical region @xmath119",
    "one finds an intercept @xmath120 and a slope @xmath121  gev@xmath122 . since @xmath123 for @xmath105",
    ", the froissard bound is respected .",
    "the function @xmath124/\\sin \\pi \\alpha ( t)$ ] with @xmath125 @xmath126 for @xmath99 even ( odd ) .",
    "@xmath127 is called the signature  : positive ( negative ) for @xmath125 @xmath126 .",
    "note that for a trajectory of positive ( negative ) signature , the numerator of @xmath128 cancels the poles in the denominator corresponding to odd ( even ) values of spin .",
    "note also that @xmath129 determines the phase of the amplitude in terms of @xmath130 . in this way the phase of the amplitude is related to its high energy behaviour  also determined by @xmath130 .",
    "( the validity of this relationship is much more general than the regge pole model ) .",
    "the regge pole model has many features that have been tested by experiment ( and no contradiction with experiment has been found ) . among its successes is the factorization of regge residues , eq .",
    "( [ 12e ] ) .",
    "another success is that , for any given two body process , when resonances exist in its @xmath57-channel , a ( shrinking ) peak is found in the @xmath59-channel amplitude near @xmath48  as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 12e])-dependence for @xmath107 , we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) and ( [ 12e ] ) , @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "we see that the forward peak has a width that increases logarithmically with increasing energy .",
    "this is called the shrinking of the forward peak and has been observed experimentally . in this way",
    "@xmath132 , i.e. the effective radius of the hadron increases like @xmath133 as @xmath134 . on the contrary , if the @xmath57-channel is `` exotic '' ( i.e. no known resonance exists having its quantum numbers ) , the forward peak in the @xmath59-channel is absent .",
    "there is no exception to this rule .",
    "unfortunately , there is an important caveat .",
    "all regge trajectories corresponding to known resonances have an intercept @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to explain the increase with energy observed in total cross - sections . in order to do so , it is necessary to postulate the existence of a regge pole with vacuum quantum numbers ( so that it can be exchanged in all elastic amplitudes ) and intercept larger than one .",
    "it is called the pomeron and is believed to correspond to the exchange of glue - balls in the @xmath57-channel .",
    "to compute its trajectory in qcd is a very difficult task .",
    "both non - perturbative and perturbative methods give indications that its trajectory is slightly above one ( @xmath136 ) as required by experiment . in this way it is possible to explain the increase with energy of total cross - sections , i.e. @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "note that for @xmath139 , the amplitude at @xmath48 is purely imaginary . with @xmath140 slightly above unity the ratio of real to imaginary parts is small .",
    "unfortunately , there is still a caveat . since @xmath141 , the pomeron exchange",
    "again violates the froissard bound .",
    "( this violation was one of the main motivations for regge models , as discussed at the beginning of this subsection ) .",
    "the only way out is to use the pomeron contribution as a born term in a unitarization scheme  such as the eikonal or glauber models discussed above . indeed , if the contribution of the born term or pomeron ( fig .",
    "1a ) to @xmath62 behaves as @xmath64 , the sum of the series ( figs .",
    "1b and 1c ) behaves as @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath144 the power behaviour of the born term is converted into @xmath145 , i.e. the maximal energy growth allowed by the froissard bound , tends to 1 ( see footnote 1 ) . upon integration in @xmath41",
    "one obtains a geometrical cross - section , proportional to @xmath146 ( see footnote 2 ) . ] .",

    "all ratios @xmath336 , @xmath315 and @xmath316 decrease with increasing centrality . the final state interactions ( [ 24e ] ) , ( [ 25e ] ) lead to a gain of strange particle yields . the reason for this is the following . in the first direct reaction ( [ 24e ] ) we have @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 . the same is true for all direct reaction ( [ 24e ] )",
    "in view of that , the effect of the inverse reactions ( [ 24e ] ) is small . on the contrary , in all reactions ( [ 25e ] ) , the product of densities in the initial and final state are comparable and the direct and inverse reactions tend to compensate with each other .",
    "baryons with the largest strange quark content , which find themselves at the end of the chain of direct reactions ( [ 24e ] ) and have the smallest yield before final state interaction , have the largest enhancement .",
    "moreover , the gain in the yield of strange baryons is larger than the one of antibaryons since @xmath340 .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement of all baryon species increases with centrality , since the gain , resulting from the first term in eq .",

    "proceeds as follows @xcite .",
    "one assumes that the energy density of the produced system is proportional to the density of participants @xmath386 of nucleus @xmath78 in a @xmath14 interaction . if @xmath387 the @xmath23 is suppressed only due to ordinary nuclear absorption with cross - section @xmath370 . on the contrary , if @xmath388 , the nuclear absorption formula is used with @xmath370 infinity . in this way",
    ", no @xmath23 can survive above the critical density .",
    "the deconfining approach leads to a satisfactory description of @xmath23 suppression , with @xmath389 treated as a free parameter suppression at very large transverse energy , @xmath390 , requires the introduction of @xmath390-fluctuations @xcite @xcite . ] .",
    "however , a quantitative analysis of the most recent na50 data @xcite is still missing . on the other hand , the centrality dependence of the average @xmath33 of @xmath23 is better described in the comovers approach than in a deconfining scenario @xcite .",
    "in these lectures a description of microscopic string models of hadronic and nucleus interactions has been presented .",
    "consequences of the model for charged particles multiplicities , net baryon production ( stopping ) , hyperon and antihyperon production ( strangeness enhancement ) and @xmath23 suppression have been examined .    as a starting point",
    "we have assumed that particles produced in different strings are independent , i.e. there is no `` cross - talk '' between strings . while this assumption works quite well in @xmath26 and @xmath25 interactions ,",
    "the @xmath14 data can only be described if final state interaction ( comovers interaction ) is introduced . however , the corresponding cross - section turns out to be rather small ( a few tenths of a milibarn ) . due to this smallness and to the short duration time of final state interaction",
    "( @xmath391  fm ) it is unlikely that thermal equilibrium can be reached .",
    "of course it is not possible to reach a definite conclusion on this important point .",
    "however , particle abundances not only do not allow to conclude that equilibrium has been reached , but , on the contrary , their centrality dependence tends to indicate that this is not the case .",
    "let us consider for instance @xmath155 and @xmath274 production . in our model , their yields",
    "are practically not affected by final state interaction , i.e. they are practically the same assuming string independence .",
    "yet , the model reproduces the data , from very peripheral to very central interaction .",
    "this success would be difficult to understand in a qgp scenario in which for peripheral collisions ( below the critical density ) there is strong , non - equilibrated , @xmath392 annihilation , which becomes equilibrated for central ones , above the critical density .",
    "more generally , the qgp scenario would be strongly supported if some kind of threshold would be found in the strange baryon yields around the critical energy density . at sps energies , evidence for such a threshold in the @xmath343 yield",
    "was claimed by the na57 collaboration based on preliminary data @xcite , but it is not seen in the more recent analysis @xcite .",
    "moreover , the saturation at large centralities of the @xmath61 and @xmath320 yields per participants , shown by the wa97 data , has also disappeared from the new data @xcite , in agreement with the predictions of the comovers interaction model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these data only cover a limited range of centrality .",
    "in contrast to this situation , the rhic data explore the whole centrality range from very peripheral to very central collisions and the centrality dependence of the yields of @xmath155 , @xmath233 , @xmath31 and their antiparticles shows no structure whatsoever .",
    "moreover , the yields of @xmath31 and @xmath343 per participant ( as well as the ratios @xmath393 and @xmath394 ) do not seem to saturate at large centralities . if the same happens for @xmath32 and @xmath395 production ( as predicted in our approach , figs .",
    "16 ) the case for qgp formation from strange baryon enhancement will be quite weak .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the final state interaction of comovers in our approach is by no means a trivial hadronic effect .",
    "indeed , the interaction of comovers starts at the early times when densities , as computed in dpm , are very large .",
    "in this situation the comovers are not hadrons ( there are several of them in the volume normally occupied by one hadron , and , moreover , at these early times hadrons are not yet formed ) .",
    "this is probably the reason why in our approach the comover interaction cross - sections required to describe the data are smaller than in hadron gas models where the final state interaction starts only after hadron formation .",
