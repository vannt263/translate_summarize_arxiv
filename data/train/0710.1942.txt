    "the physical size and shape of the materials strongly effect the nature , the dynamics of the electronic excitations , the lattice vibrations , and the dynamics of carriers .",
    "for example , in the mesoscopic systems , the dimension of system is comparable with the coherence length of carriers and this leads to some new phenomena that they do not appear in a bulk semiconductor , such as quantum interference between carrier s motion @xcite . in these physical systems different particles",
    "are confined in a small space and interact with each other . as usual , we use quantum field theory ( qft ) and second quantization procedure for considering interacting many particles physical systems .",
    "standard qft is based on quantum mechanics on an infinite line without any boundaries .",
    "however , the presence of infinite walls in standard qft can detect vacuum effect of electromagnetic field and gives rise to casimir effect @xcite .",
    "hence , in a system with small dimensions we expect some new phenomena appear , and barriers effects show themselves . + recent progress in growth techniques and development of micromachinig technology in designing mesoscopic systems and nanostructures , have led to intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental investigations @xcite on electronic and optical properties of those systems .",
    "the most important point about the nanoscale structures is that the quantum confinement effects play the center - stone role .",
    "one can even say in general that recent success in nanofabrication technique has resulted in great interest in various artificial physical systems with usual phenomena driven by the quantum confinement ( quantum dots , quantum wires and quantum wells ) .",
    "a number of recent experiments have demonstrated that isolated semiconductor quantum dots are capable of emitting light @xcite .",
    "it becomes possible to combine high - q optical microcavities with quantum dot emitters as the active medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are many theoretical attempts for understanding the optical and electronic properties of nanostructures especially semiconductor quantum dots @xcite . because of intensive researches in this area , it is reasonable to consider the finite size effects on the em field including the quantization of the em field in confined regions that their sizes are of order of electromagnetic wavelength , such as microcavities . on the other hand ,",
    "a nanostructure such as quantum dot , is a system that carrier s motion is confined inside a small region , and during the interaction with other systems , the generated excitations such as phonons , excitons , plasmons are confined in small region .",
    "hence we want to answer this question : what are the spatial confinement effects on excitation states in quantum field theoretical description of nanostructures ?",
    "it seems that to answer this question we need to know the confinement and boundary conditions effects in qft .",
    "first , we consider spatial confinement effect on a simple quantum harmonic oscillator and then we shall use this oscillator in quantizing the fields .",
    "+ as mentioned before , the standard qft is based on the quantum mechanics on an infinite line . in the canonical qft",
    "the main tool is quantum oscillator .",
    "energy eigenvalues of quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) is given by @xmath0 , and these successive energy levels were interpreted as being obtained by creation of a quantum particle of energy @xmath1 .",
    "this interpretation of the energy spectrum of qho was successfully used in the second quantization formalism @xcite .",
    "plank s hypothesis is realized in the second quantization formalism by using creation and annihilation operators of the qho .",
    "this realization is obtained for qho defined on an infinite line .",
    "+ it is reasonable to claim that , in considering qft in a finite region one can use energy levels of a qho confined in that finite space and therefore analyze the consequences of this assumption in construction of such qft on a compact manifold .",
    "as we shall see in subsequent sections , the spatial confinement of the qho leads to a deformed heisenberg algebra for the ordinary harmonic oscillator .",
    "a deformed algebra is a nontrivial generalization of a given algebra through the introduction of one or more complex parameters , such that , in a certain limit of parameters the non - deformed algebra is recovered ; these parameters are called deformation parameters .",
    "there have been several attempts to generalize heisenberg algebra , and a particular deformation of heisenberg algebra has led to the notion f - oscillator @xcite .",
    "an f - oscillator is a non - harmonic system , that from mathematical point of view its dynamical variables ( creation and annihilation operators ) constructed from a non canonical transformation through @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are corresponding harmonic oscillator operators and @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath6 is called deformation function that depends on the number of quanta and some physical parameters .",
    "the presence of operator - valued deformation function causes the heisenberg algebra of the standard qho to transform into a deformed heisenberg algebra .",
    "the nonlinearity in f - oscillators means dependence of the frequency on the intensity @xcite . on the other hand , in contrast to the standard qho , f",
    "- oscillators have not equal spaced energy spectrum .",
    "if we confine a simple qho inside an infinite well , due to the spatial confinement , the energy levels constitute a spectrum that is not equal spaced .",
    "therefore , in this case it is reasonable to expect to find a corresponding f - oscillator .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the qho is the construction of coherent states , as the eigenfunction of annihilation operator .",
    "as is well known @xcite one can introduce nonlinear coherent states or f - coherent states as the right - hand eigenstates of deformed annihilation operator @xmath7 .",
    "it has been shown that these families of generalized coherent states exhibit various non - classical properties @xcite . due to",
    "these properties and their applications , generation of these states is a very important issue in the context of quantum optics .",
    "the f - coherent states may appear as stationary states of the center - of - mass motion of a trapped ion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a theoretical scheme for generation of these states in micromaser in the frame work of intensity - dependent jaynes - cummings model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "+ it has also been shown @xcite that there is a close connection between the deformation function appeared in the nonlinear coherent states algebraic structure and the non - commutative geometry of the configuration space .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown recently @xcite , that if a two - mode qho confined on the surface of a sphere , can be interpreted as a single mode deformed oscillator , whose and its quantum statistics depends on the curvature of sphere .",
    "+ motivated by the above - mentioned results , in the present contribution we are intended to investigate the spatial confinement effects on physical properties of a standard qho .",
    "it will be seen that the confinement leads to deformation of standard qho",
    ". then we use this confined oscillator to considering boundary effects in qft . in a recent work @xcite",
    "the authors have considered boundary effects in qft and for this purpose they have used a qho defined on a circle and its associated algebra , which is a realization of a deformed heisenberg algebra has been introduced in ref.@xcite . to construct qft",
    "they have used this special deformed algebra and the calculus on a lattice without any definite commutation relation between field operators . in this paper",
    ", we consider a qho confined in a one - dimensional infinite well without periodic boundary conditions , and we find its energy levels , as well as associated ladder operators .",
    "we show that the ladder operators can be interpreted as a special kind of the so - called f - deformed creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "then , we use this oscillator as a basis for the canonical quantization of the electromagnetic ( em ) field in a confined space . in ref .",
    "@xcite the quantization of the electromagnetic field is performed by making use of the q - deformed oscillator without any quantization postulate . in our quantization scheme",
    "we use the quantization postulate and impose canonical commutation relation on hamiltonian of the system under consideration . in order to keep commutation relation between field and its conjugate momentum we deform hilbert space of the system .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , we review some physical properties of f - oscillator and its coherent states . in section 3",
    "we consider the spatially confined qho in a one - dimensional infinite well and construct its associated coherent states .",
    "we shall also examine some of their quantum statistical properties , including sub - poissonian statistics and quadrature squeezing .",
    "in section 4 we use the confined oscillator under consideration and its algebra to construct a quantum theory of fields , and as an example we quantize the electromagnetic field . in section 5 we propose a dynamical scheme for generating the nonlinear coherent state associated with the em field in a confined region . finally we summarize our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we review the basics of the f - deformed quantum oscillator and the associated coherent states known in the literature as nonlinear coherent states . for this purpose , we consider an eigenvalue problem for a given quantum physical system and we focus our attention on the properties of creation and annihilation operators , that allows to make transition between the states of discrete spectrum of the system hamiltonian . as usual , we expand the hamiltonian in its eigenvectors @xmath8 where we choose @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce the creation ( raising ) and annihilation ( lowering ) operators as follows @xmath10 so that @xmath11 .",
    "these ladder operators satisfy the following commutation relation @xmath12=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(e_{i+1}-e_{i})|i\\rangle\\langle i|\\:.\\ ] ] obviously if the energy spectrum is equally spaced , because of this condition , energy spectrum must be linear in quantum numbers , ( as in the case of ordinary qho ) , then @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant and the commutator of @xmath7 and @xmath15 becomes a constant ( a rescaled weyl - heisenberg algebra ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the energy spectrum is not equally spaced , the ladder operators of the system satisfy a deformed heisenberg algebra , i.e. their commutator depends on quantum numbers that appear in energy spectrum .",
    "this is one of the most important properties of the quantum f - oscillators @xcite .",
    "+ an f - oscillator is a non - harmonic system characterized by a hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator form @xmath16 with a specific frequency @xmath17 and deformed boson creation and annihilation operators defined in ( [ defo ] ) .",

    "+ furthermore , by using the heisenberg equation of motion with hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) we have @xmath25\\hspace{1cm}(\\hbar=1).\\ ] ] we obtain the following solution to the heisenberg equation of motion for f - deformed operators @xmath7 and @xmath15 defined in equation ( [ defo ] ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 in this sense , the f - deformed oscillator can be interpreted as a nonlinear oscillator whose frequency of vibrations depends explicitly on its number of excitation quanta @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out that recent studies @xcite have revealed strictly physical relationship between the nonlinearity concept resulting from f - deformation and some nonlinear optical effects , e.g. , kerr nonlinearity , in the context of atom - field interaction .",
    "+ the nonlinear transformation of the creation and annihilation operators leads naturally to the notion of nonlinear coherent states or f - coherent states .",
    "the nonlinear coherent states @xmath28 are defined as the right - hand eigenstates of the deformed operator @xmath29 @xmath30 from eq.([coh ] ) one can obtain an explicit form of the nonlinear coherent states in a number state representation @xmath31 where the coefficients @xmath32 s and normalization constant @xmath33 are respectively given by @xmath34 in recent years nonlinear coherent states have been paid much attentions because they exhibit nonclassical features @xcite and many quantum optical states , such as squeezed states , phase states , negative binomial states and photon - added coherent states can be viewed as a sort of nonlinear coherent states @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider a quantum harmonic oscillator confined in a one dimensional infinite well .",
    "many attempts have been done for solving this problem ( see @xcite-@xcite , and references therein ) . in most of those works , authors tried to solve the problem numerically . but",
    "in our consideration we try to solve the problem analytically , to reveal the relationship between the confinement effect and given deformation function .",
    "we start from the schrdinger equation ( we assume @xmath35 ) @xmath36\\psi(x)=e\\psi(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath37 instead of solving the schrdinger equation for the qho confined between infinite rectangular walls in positions @xmath38 , we propose to solve the eigenvalue equation for the potential @xmath39 where @xmath40 , is a scaling factor depending on the width of the well .",
    "this potential models a qho placed in the center of the rectangular infinite well @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath41 fulfills two asymptotic requirements : 1 ) @xmath42 when @xmath43 ( free harmonic oscillator limit ) .",
    "2 ) @xmath41 at equilibrium position have the same curvature as a free qho , @xmath44_{x=0}=k$ ] .",
    "+ now we consider the following equation @xmath45\\psi(x)=0\\;.\\ ] ] to solve analytically this equation , we use the factorization method @xcite . by changing the variable and some mathematical manipulation , the corresponding energy eigenvalues are found as @xmath46 where @xmath47,and @xmath48 is the frequency of the qho .",
    "the first term in the energy spectrum can be interpreted as the energy of a free particle in a well , the second term denotes the energy spectrum of the qho , and the last term shifts energy spectrum by a constant amount .",
    "it is evident that if @xmath43 then @xmath49 and the energy spectrum ( [ eee ] ) reduces to the spectrum of the free qho .",
    "as is clear from ( [ eee ] ) , different energy levels are not equally spaced , hence confining a free qho leads to deformation of its dynamical algebra , and we can interpret the parameter @xmath50 as the deformation parameter . in table ( [ malek ] ) the numerical results associated with the original potential are compared with the generated results from model potential . as is seen the results are in a good agreement when boundary size is of order of characteristic length of the harmonic oscillator . on the other hand , the numerical results given in ref .",
    "@xcite are related to the original potential , confined qho in the one - dimensional infinite well .",
    "this oscillator when approached to the boundaries of well suddenly becomes infinite , while the model potential is smooth and approach to infinity asymptotically .",
    "therefore , the model potential ( [ pot ] ) is more appropriate for the physical systems will be considered later .",
    "+ if we renormalize eq.([eee ] ) to energy quanta of the simple harmonic oscillator and introducing the new variables @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 then eq.([eee ] ) takes the following form @xmath54 by comparing this spectrum with the energy spectrum of an f - deformed oscillator ( [ energy ] ) , we find the corresponding deformation function as @xmath55 this function leads to spectrum eq.([eee ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the ladder operators associated with the confined oscillator under consideration can be written in terms of the conventional ( non - deformed ) operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 as follows @xmath56 these two operators satisfy the following commutation relation @xmath12=\\gamma(2\\hat{n}+1)+\\alpha.\\ ] ] it is obvious that in the limiting case @xmath43 ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) , the right hand side of the above commutation relation becomes independent of @xmath59 , and the deformed algebra reduces to a the conventional weyl - heisenberg algebra for a free qho . + classically , harmonic oscillator is a particle that attached to an ideal spring , and can oscillate with specific amplitude . when that particle be confined",
    ", boundaries can affect particle s motion if the boundaries position be in a smaller distance in comparison with a characteristic length that particle oscillate in it .",
    "this characteristic length for the qho is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and if @xmath62 , then the presence of boundaries affect the behavior of qho , otherwise it behaves like a free qho .",
    "therefore , one can interpret @xmath63 as a scale length where the deformation effects become relevant .",
    "now , we focus our attention on the coherent states associated with the qho under consideration . as usual",

    "the electric field operator or the conjugate momentum associated with @xmath170 is given by @xmath182.\\ ] ] it is easy to show that @xmath183=&&\\frac{-i}{2v}\\sum_{\\vec k,\\lambda}\\varepsilon_i(\\vec k,\\lambda)\\varepsilon_j(\\vec k,\\lambda)\\times\\\\ \\nonumber & & [ u_k(\\vec r)u_k^{\\ast}(\\vec{r'})+u_k^{\\ast}(\\vec r)u_k(\\vec{r'})]h(\\hat{n}_{k,\\lambda}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath184=h(\\hat{n}_{k\\lambda})=\\gamma(2\\hat{n}_{k\\lambda}+1)+\\alpha$ ] .",
    "as is seen , in contrast to the quantization postulate ( [ quan ] ) , the right hand side of the above commutator is an operator - valued function .",
    "if we use the deformed operators @xmath178 , @xmath179 as amplitudes of the field expansion , the quantization postulate imposed on the canonically conjugate variables of the em field is not preserved . to preserve the commutation relation ( [ quan ] ) , we propose using another pair of deformed operators in the fourier decomposition of the field operator . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider the following dual operator of @xmath141 @xcite @xmath185 which satisfy the commutation relation @xmath186=\\delta_{kk'}\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}.\\ ] ] we use these operators to expand the field operator @xmath187.\\ ] ] as is clear , the operators @xmath178 and @xmath188 are not adjoint of each other with respect to the ordinary scalar product , so the field operator is not hermitian .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , there is a representation in which the operator @xmath189 is adjoint of the f - deformed operator @xmath141 with respect to a new scalar product in the carrier hilbert space .",
    "hence , in order to preserve the quantization postulate , we should deform the hilbert space .",
    "we show the ordinary scalar product by @xmath190 and the deformed one by @xmath191 .",
    "since both scalar products are defined on the same hilbert space , they correspond to the same metric .",
    "the relation between these two scalar product according to ( [ rrt ] ) can be written as @xmath192 where @xmath193 defines the relationship between two scalar products and it can be determined from the condition that @xmath141 and @xmath189 be adjoint of each other : @xmath194 therefore one can readily verify that @xmath193 is given by @xmath195 from eqs.([rrt ] ) and ( [ nsa ] ) operator @xmath114 can be found as @xmath196 and according to eq.([aaa ] ) the operators @xmath178 and @xmath179 can be obtained by the action of @xmath114 . now except other meaning of @xmath197 we can interpret it as a transformation , that by its action ordinary system can be changed to a confined system with definite barriers s position . + now instead of expanding the field operator in plane wave basis we expand it in a basis that is orthogonal with respect to the new scalar product ( [ scal ] ) @xmath198,\\ ] ] where @xmath199 , is a basis that is orthogonal in the new representation as mentioned in mathematical preliminary section . in this new representation the field operator defined in eq.([field1 ] ) becomes hermitian .",
    "furthermore , the electric field operator reads as @xmath200,\\ ] ] and the quantization postulate is recovered @xmath201=-i\\delta^3_{\\perp ij}(r - r').\\ ] ] as mentioned before , in the confined region the hamiltonian of the em field is the same as in free space .",
    "this hamiltonian in the coulomb gauge is given by @xmath202 where @xmath141 refer to the magnetic field . by substituting the field operator @xmath170 given by ( [ field1 ] ) in the above expression",
    "we arrive at the following hamiltonian @xmath203 thus , the hamiltonian can be interpreted as a collection of f - oscillators for different modes of the em field .",
    "the eigensates of @xmath204 which form a complete set and span the hilbert space of the system , are given by @xmath205 where @xmath95 is the vacuum state of the system i.e. @xmath206 . in this manner",
    ", we interpret each particle as an excitation of qho confined in an infinite well .",
    "this formulation can be used in confined systems and nanostructures for considering elementary excitations , such as ecxitons ( which is a composite excitation ) , phonons and plasmons .",
    "+ in quantum theory of fields , there are two important concepts that are very useful in considering interacting fields .",
    "one of them is feynman propagator which is defined for a general field operator @xmath207 as @xcite @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the time - ordered operator ( we show the time ordering operator by @xmath209 for making distinction between this operator and the operator @xmath114 defined in ( [ hehehe ] ) ) .",
    "now , if we assume that the field under consideration is spatially confined , then according to the definition of the deformed scalar product given by ( [ scal ] ) the corresponding feynman propagator is defined as @xmath210 making use of this definition for the photon field in a confined region and applying field operator ( [ field1 ] ) result in : @xmath211 where @xmath212 .",
    "eq.([fey ] ) shows that the feynman propagator has not any difference in confined field theory except a constant factor that depends on some physical parameters such as the size of the system , and reduces to the standard propagator when the boundaries tend to infinity .",
    "another important concept is the scattering matrix ( s matrix ) , that describes the probability amplitude for a process in which the system makes a transition from an initial state to a final state under the influence of an interaction . according to the concept of s matrix , the probability amplitude for a transition from the initial state @xmath213 into the final state @xmath214",
    "is defined as @xmath215 where operator @xmath216 is defined in terms of the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture as @xcite @xmath217.\\ ] ] in our formalism , according to the new definition of scalar product we define the probability amplitude as @xmath218 and due to the concept of fock states we have @xmath219 this equation shows that the new s matrix is proportional to the standard s matrix with a constant of proportionality that is a function of number of quantum excitations .",
    "furthermore , we can conclude that spatial confinement of an interacting system results in an intensity - dependent coupling constant . as an example , consider an em field that interacts with a fermionic system in a confined region .",
    "we assume that in this system , fermions be expressed by undeformed dirac field operator denoted by @xmath220 , and photons are described by ( [ field1 ] ) .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath221 therefore the @xmath222 matrix is given by @xmath223+\\cdots\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath224 denotes the normal ordering .",
    "so one can conclude from ( [ smat ] ) that coupling constant in each term of the expansion has a same dependence on the intensity of the photon field .",
    "dependence of coupling constant on intensity is a indication of nonlinear interaction .",
    "in this section we consider an infinite well directed in the z - direction , in which we have a current density ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "for example , an electron that moving in axial direction of the well generates the following classical current @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the velocity of electron . in the presence of current density , the equation of motion for",
    "the vector potential @xmath168 ( according to the maxwell equations ) reads as @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the transverse part of the current density .",
    "this equation can be derived from the hamiltonian @xmath230 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{k,\\lambda}\\left(\\omega_k\\hat{b}^{\\dag}_{fk\\lambda}\\hat{b}_{k\\lambda}\\right)+\\frac{1}{c}\\int d^3r\\vec{j'}(r , t)\\centerdot\\hat{\\vec{a}}(r , t ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{k,\\lambda}[\\omega_k\\hat{b}^{\\dag}_{fk\\lambda}\\hat{b}_{k\\lambda } \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\vec{\\varepsilon}(k,\\lambda ) } { \\sqrt{2v \\omega_k}}\\int d^3r\\left(\\hat{b}_{k\\lambda}g(k , r)+\\hat{b}^{\\dag}_{fk\\lambda}g^{\\ast}(k , r)\\right)\\centerdot\\vec{j'}(r , t)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transverse density current @xmath231 and the polarization vectors are in the same plane and are in the same direction .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath232.\\ ] ] where @xmath233 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath234 that follows from the above hamitonian reads as @xmath235 if we define a new variable @xmath236 , the solution of eq.([equm ] ) is @xmath237 the time dependence of the operator @xmath238 can be regarded as a result of the following unitary transformation @xmath239.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by definition @xmath240 .",
    "the operator @xmath241 is a displacement - like operator @xcite .",
    "if we choose the initial state of the em field to be the vacuum @xmath95 , then the state vector at time @xmath242 is @xmath243|0\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-\\frac{|\\beta(k , t)|^2}{2}}\\sum_n \\frac{\\beta^n(k , t)}{[f(n)]!n!}(\\hat{a}^{\\dag})^n|0\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & e^{-\\frac{|\\beta(k , t)|^2}{2}}\\sum_n\\frac{\\beta^n(k , t)}{\\sqrt{n!}[f(n)]!}|n\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the sense of eqs.([coh])-([coh1 ] ) it is evident that this state can be regarded as a nonlinear coherent state .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the relation between the spatial confinement effects and special kind of f - deformed algebra .",
    "we have found that the confined simple harmonic oscillator can be interpreted as an f - oscillator , and we have obtained the corresponding deformation function .",
    "then we have searched the effects of boundary conditions in quantum field theory .",
    "we have used f - deformed operators as the dynamical variables and found that for preserving commutation relation between the field operator and its conjugate momentum we should deform hilbert space of the system under consideration . as a result of new definition of scalar product ,",
    "we have concluded that the coupling constant of interactions in confined systems become a function of number of excitation , for example in the case of em field coupling constant becomes a function of intensity of em field .",
    "finally we have proposed a theoretical scheme for generating nonlinear coherent states of em field through the coupling of a classical current to the vector potential operator @xmath170 inside a confined region .",
