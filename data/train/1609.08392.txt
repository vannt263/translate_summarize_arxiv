    "various field theories suggest the existence of string  like configurations , which are the particle physics analogs of vortices or magnetic flux tubes .",
    "these configurations can arise at scales ranging from the fundamental distances in string theory to astrophysical distances , where in the latter case they are often called _ cosmic strings _ , _",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "a particularly interesting case is that of @xmath0strings , typically involving the @xmath0boson field in theories similar to the standard model  @xcite . since these string configurations are not classically stable we explore the possibility that they are stabilized by quantum effects .",
    "the regularized and renormalized sum over the changes of all zero point energies of the quantum fluctuations in the string background , the so  called vacuum polarization energy ( vpe ) , is central to these investigations .",
    "in field theory quantum effects are typically estimated by feynman diagram techniques .",
    "unfortunately , string configurations have a non  trivial structure at spatial infinity which makes the formulation of a feynman perturbation expansion impossible without any further adaptation .",
    "even then , the convergence of the series is not guaranteed as the relevant couplings are not necessarily small and the series is only asymptotic .",
    "not surprisingly , the study of the vpe of cosmic string configurations has a long history of slow progress as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "starting point for parameterizing a cosmic string configuration is the @xmath1 unit vector  @xcite @xmath2 where the constant angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 are designated to describe the ( weak ) isospin orientation of the string and @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle in coordinate space.direction in coordinate space . ] for simplicity , we will always consider unit winding of the string ; generalizations to winding number @xmath6 merely require the replacement @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "the profile functions vanish at the core of the string ( @xmath20 ) and approach unity at spatial infinity .",
    "in what follows we will employ the abbreviations @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a global rotation within the plane of the second and third component of @xmath23 by the angle @xmath24 with @xmath25 transforms it into @xmath26 hence observables ( which , by definition , are gauge invariant ) will not depend on the two angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 individually but only on the product @xmath27",
    ". stated otherwise , all observables must remain invariant along paths of constant @xmath27 in isospin space  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the fermion contribution to the vpe because for many ( internal ) fermion degrees of freedom , as _",

    "this creates the immediate problem that individual fourier transformations ( needed , _ e.g. _ to compute feynman diagrams ) of the higgs and gauge fields are ill  defined . to avoid this problem we introduce an additional radial function @xmath34 with the boundary values @xmath35 and @xmath36 to define the local @xmath37 gauge transformation @xmath38 \\qquad { \\rm with}\\qquad { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\xi$\\unboldmath}}(\\rho,\\varphi)=\\xi(\\rho)\\,\\begin{pmatrix } s_2\\ , { \\rm cos}\\varphi \\cr   -s_2\\ , { \\rm sin}\\varphi \\cr c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\ , .",
