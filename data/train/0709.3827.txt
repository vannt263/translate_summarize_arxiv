    "there exists a fundamental tradeoff between diversity ( error probability ) and multiplexing ( rate ) .",
    "this tradeoff was characterized in the high snr regime for flat fading channels with multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas ( mimo ) @xcite .",
    "this characterization was done in terms of multiplexing rate which captured the rate - growth ( with @xmath0 ) and diversity order which represented reliability ( at high @xmath0 ) .",
    "this diversity multiplexing ( d - m ) tradeoff has been extended to several cases including fading isi channels @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the presence of isi gives significant improvement of the diversity order .",
    "in fact , for the siso case the improvement was equivalent to having multiple receive antennas equal to the number of isi taps @xcite .",
    "a different perspective for opportunistic communication was presented in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a strategy that combined high rate communications with high reliability ( diversity ) was investigated .",
    "clearly , the overall code will still be governed by the rate - reliability tradeoff , but the idea was to ensure the high reliability ( diversity ) of at least part of the total information . these are called diversity - embedded codes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that when we have one degree of freedom ( one transmit many receive or one receive many transmit antennas ) the d - m tradeoff was successively refinable .",
    "that is , the high priority scheme ( with higher diversity order ) can attain the optimal diversity - multiplexing ( d - m ) performance as if the low priority stream was absent .",
    "however , the low priority scheme ( with lower diversity order ) attains the same d - m performance as that of the aggregate rate of the two streams . when there is more than one degree of freedom ( for example , parallel fading channels ) such a successive refinement property does not hold @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the diversity embedded codes for an isi channel with single transmit and receive antenna . since the fourier basis is the eigenbasis for linear time invariant channels we can decompose the transmission into a set of parallel channels . since it is known that the d - m tradeoff for parallel fading channels is not successively refinable @xcite , it is tempting to expect the same for fading isi channels .",
    "however , the main result of this paper is that for siso fading isi channels the d - m tradeoff is indeed successively refinable .",
    "the correlations of the fading across the parallel channels seem to cause the difference in the behavior . the structural observations in lemma [ magnitude ] give insight into these correlations .",
    "this will be made more precise in the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the problem statement and present the notation .",
    "section 3 gives a variation of the proof in @xcite of the d - m tradeoff for isi channels which makes a connection to the diversity embedded codes .",
    "we explore the role of correlation in successive refinement through a specific example .",
    "section 4 presents the statement and the proof for the successive refinability of the d - m tradeoff for isi channels .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief discussion followed by the details of the proofs in the appendix .",

    "analogous to @xcite we define the multiplexing rate @xmath8 and the diversity order @xmath9 as follows , @xmath10    with these definitions , the d - m tradeoff for isi channels was established in @xcite .",

    "the rates for the two message sets as a function of @xmath0 are , respectively , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the decoder jointly decodes the two message sets and we can define two error probabilities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which denote the average error probabilities for message sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",

    "note that for the joint codebook @xmath21 the total multiplexing rate is @xmath22 and the diversity @xmath23 .",

    "there is no interference between successive transmitted symbols and the receiver performs matched filtering to recover the symbol from the @xmath2 copies of the received signal .",

    "in which we assume that after transmission over a block length @xmath44 , in the last @xmath39 instants zero symbol is transmitted in order to avoid interblock interference .",

    "given this view since the d - m tradeoff for parallel channels are not successively refinable we would expect that such a characterization also hold for the isi d - m tradeoff .",

    "clearly , the error probability of the scheme with this decoder , denoted by @xmath78 , is an upper bound to the error probability _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , we can write , @xmath80 the last equality is true due to lemma [ lemma1 ] ( given in section 4 ) which states that if @xmath81 the probability of error decays exponentially in @xmath82 .",
    "this lemma in turn is based on a structural observation made in lemma [ magnitude ] ( also see section 3 ) that at most @xmath76 coefficients in frequency domain will be smaller than @xmath83 and here given that @xmath81 at most @xmath76 coefficients will be smaller than @xmath84 .",
    "this method of analysis turns out to be more useful for us and takes into account the fact that the sets of parallel channels are correlated .",
