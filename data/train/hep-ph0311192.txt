    "the signature of a typical diffractive event in @xmath1 collisions is characterized by a leading proton or antiproton and/or a region at large pseudorapidity with no particles , also known as _ rapidity gap_. hard diffraction processes are hadronic interactions that incorporate a high transverse momentum partonic scattering , while carrying the characteristic signature of a diffractive event .",

    "diffractive dijet events are characterized by the presence of two jets resulting from a hard scattering and a leading antiproton which escapes the collision intact , only losing a small momentum fraction @xmath4 to the pomeron .",
    "events can be described in terms of a pomeron emitted from the anti - proton and scattering with a parton from the proton .",
    "the gluon and quark content of the interacting partons can be investigated by comparing single diffractive ( sd ) and non - diffractive ( nd ) events .",
    "the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive dijet production rates is proportional to the ratio of the corresponding structure functions and can be studied as a function of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath5 of the struck parton in the antiproton , where @xmath6 corresponds to the pomeron momentum fraction carried by the parton . for each event , @xmath7 is evaluated from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the jets using the equation    @xmath10    in run  i , cdf measured the ratio of sd to nd dijet production rates using the rp spectrometer to detect leading antiprotons .",
    "the cdf result  @xcite is suppressed by a factor of @xmath11 relative to predictions from hera data , indicating a breakdown of conventional factorization between hera and the tevatron .",
    "correct predictions can be obtained by scaling the rapidity gap probability distribution of the diffractive structure function to the total integrated gap probability  @xcite .    in run",
    "ii , a dedicated trigger ( rp+j5 ) selects events with a three - fold rp coincidence and at least one calorimeter tower with @xmath12  gev .",
    "a further offline selection requires at least two jets of @xmath13  gev and @xmath14 .",
    "jets are corrected for detector effects and underlying event corrections .",
    "calorimeter information alone is used to determine @xmath15 , which is calculated using all calorimeter towers including mps ( fig .  [ xi ] , left ) .",
    "the declining of the distribution at @xmath16 occurs in the region where the rp acceptance is decreasing .",
    "a large number of events are at @xmath17 , where the contribution comes from two sources : diffractive dijets with a superimposed soft non - diffractive interaction , and non - diffractive dijets superimposed with a soft diffractive interaction .",
    "the plateau observed between @xmath18 ( sd ) results from a @xmath19 distribution , which is expected for diffractive production .",
    "mean dijet pseudorapidity distributions , @xmath20 , are shown in figure  [ xi ] ( right ) .",
    "nd events are distributed around a mean value of @xmath21 , while sd events are shifted to positive @xmath22 values , indicating the boost of the center - of - mass of the interacting particles opposite to the recoil antiproton .",
    "= 1.0    measurement of the sd to nd event rate ratio is consistent with the run  i result ( fig .",
    "[ run2_sf ] , left ) .",
    "furthermore , the jet @xmath8 spectrum extends to higher values than in run  i. a preliminary result indicates that the ratio does not depend strongly on @xmath23 in the range from @xmath24  gev@xmath25 up to 1600  gev@xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ run2_sf ] , right ) .",
    "the relative normalization uncertainty cancels out in the ratio .",
    "this result indicates that the @xmath26 evolution of the pomeron is similar to that of the proton .",
    "in double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) dijet production , a pomeron is emitted from each nucleon and a pomeron - pomeron collision results in an exclusive dijet final state , produced together with both the leading proton and anti - proton surviving the interaction and escaping in the very forward region . at cdf",
    ", the rp can only detect the anti - proton .    in run  ii , the rp+j5 trigger , which was discussed in the previous section ,",
    "can also be used to study dpe events .",
    "this trigger selects a fraction of dpe events which can be isolated by counting bsc and mp multiplicities on the proton side ( fig .",
    "[ dpe_et_dphi ] , left ) .",
    "the two peaks , at high and low multiplicity , are due to sd and dpe events , respectively .",
    "furthermore , a much larger sample has already been collected with a dedicated trigger .",
    "the dpe trigger requires one rp coincidence , a proton - side rapidity gap in the bscs , and at least one calorimeter tower ( @xmath275  gev ) in the central detector .",
    "multiple interactions are rejected offline by requiring events with number of vertices @xmath28 .",
    "at least two jets ( @xmath2910  gev , @xmath14 ) are required .",
    "the sample is further tightened by requiring the events to have @xmath30 . in order to reduce multiplicity fluctuations in sd events and thus enhance dpe events , a rapidity gap of @xmath31 units , including mp and bsc ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "is also required on the proton side . in @xmath33 of data ,",
    "the final sample consists of approximately 17,000 events .",
    "the @xmath8 distributions for both leading and next - to - leading ( fig .",
    "[ dpe_et_dphi ] , right ) jets are similar for nd , sd and dpe samples .",
    "the dijet azimuthal angle difference shows that jets are more back - to - back in dpe events than in sd events ( fig .",
    "[ dpe_massratio ] , left ) .",
    "the exclusive dijet production rate of these dpe events is of great interest to determine the exclusive higgs production cross section and prepare for the lhc experiments  @xcite .",
    "the dijet mass fraction ( @xmath34 ) , defined as the dijet invariant mass ( @xmath35 ) divided by the mass of the entire system @xmath36 , is calculated by using all available energy in the calorimeter .",
    "if jets are produced exclusively , @xmath34 should be equal to one .",
    "uncorrected energies are used in figure  [ dpe_massratio ] ( right ) and no visible excess is evident over a smooth distribution . after including systematic uncertainties , an upper limit on the exclusive dijet production cross section",

    "cosmic ray and fake `` photon ''  @xcite background sources are estimated to be negligible .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations due to calorimeter noise are expected to be small .",
    "however , it is experimentally difficult to evaluate their final contribution to the background , given the small number of events .",
    "therefore , the 10 events found are to be considered as an upper limit on exclusive production cross section . after calculating trigger efficiency , detector and selection cut acceptances , under the assumption that all observed `` dimuon plus em tower '' candidates are from exclusive @xmath38 events ,",
