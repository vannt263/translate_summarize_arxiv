    "studies of classical strings in @xmath1 was an important part of the recent work on the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it was observed that the energies of the fast moving classical strings reproduce the anomalous dimension of the field theory operators with the large r - charge , at least in the first and probably the second order of the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "classical superstring in @xmath1 is an integrable system .",
    "an important tool in the study of this system is the super - yangian symmetry discussed in @xcite .",
    "the nonabelian dressing symmetries were also found in the classical yang - mills theory , see the recent discussion in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the super - yangian symmetry is also a symmetry of the yang - mills perturbation theory .",
    "it was shown that the one - loop anomalous dimension is proportional to the first casimir operator in the yangian representation .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that the higher loop contributions to the anomalous dimension correspond to the higher casimirs in the yangian representation , in the following sense .",
    "we conjecture that there are infinitely many operators @xmath2 acting on the spin chain hilbert space , commuting : @xmath3=0\\ ] ] and depending on the thooft coupling constant @xmath4 as power series : @xmath5 and such that the anomalous dimension @xmath6 has an expansion : @xmath7 it should be true that @xmath8 involves @xmath9 nearest neighbors in the chain . notice that @xmath10 explicitly depends on @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the expansion of the anomalous dimension is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 notice that @xmath13\\neq 0 $ ] for @xmath14 .",
    "we have argued in @xcite that the relation analogous to ( [ deltainfieldtheory ] ) holds for the classical string in @xmath1 , the conserved charge @xmath15 corresponding to the @xmath9-th improved pohlmeyer charge .",
    "we suggested to identify the anomalous dimension with the deck transformation acting on the phase space of the classical string in ads times a sphere .",
    "the deck transformation can be defined as the action of the center of the conformal group .",
    "it is a _ geometric _ symmetry of the classical string ; it comes from a geometric symmetry of the ads space .",
    "but it can be expressed in terms of the _ hidden _ symmetries .",
    "string theory in ads times a sphere has an infinite family of local conserved charges , the pohlmeyer charges @xcite . these pohlmeyer charges can be thought of as the classical limit of the yangian casimirs .",
    "we have argued in @xcite that the deck transformation is in fact generated by an infinite linear combination of the pohlmeyer charges ; the coefficients of this linear combination were fixed in @xcite .",
    "we used in our arguments the existence of a special action variable in the theory of the classical string on @xmath16 which was discussed in @xcite following @xcite .",
    "the special property of this particular action variable is that in each order of the null - surface perturbation theory @xcite it is given by a local expression part and the @xmath17 part .",
    "but the fermions `` glue together '' the ads and the sphere .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that this action variable still exists in the supersymmetric case but is not local .",
    "what survives the supersymmetric extension is the statement that the deck transformation in each order of the null - surface perturbation theory is generated by a finite sum of the local conserved charges ( the classical analogues of the super - yangian casimirs ) .",
    "indeed , the definition of the deck transformation does not require the splitting of the sigma - model into two parts and the locality of the deck transformation in the perturbation theory is manifest ; it is essentially a consequence of the worldsheet causality .",

    "this action variable corresponds to the _ length _ of the spin chain on the field theory side @xcite .",
    "this `` length '' was studied for the finite gap solutions in @xcite . here",
    "we will study it for the rational solutions .",
    "we will consider the simplest case of the classical string on @xmath18 .",
    "this system is related @xcite to the sine - gordon model and we will actually discuss mostly the sine - gordon model . the existence of the special action variable can be understood locally on the worldsheet , at least in the null - surface perturbation theory . therefore to study this action variable we do not have to impose the periodicity conditions on the spacial direction of the string worldsheet",
    "; we can formally consider infinitely long strings .",
    "this allows us to use the rational solutions of the sine - gordon equation which are probably `` simpler '' than the finite gap solutions studied in @xcite ( at least if we consider the elementary functions `` simpler '' than the theta functions . )    in section [ sec : sinegordon ] we discuss the relation between the classical string propagating on @xmath18 and the sine - gordon model . in section [ sec : tau ] we discuss the tau - function and bilinear identities . in section [ sec : backlund ] we discuss bcklund transformations and define the `` hidden '' symmetry @xmath19 . in section [ sec : freefieldlimit ] we consider the plane wave limit . in section [ sec",

    "we summarize our construction of the action variable and outline the analogous construction for the @xmath20 sigma model .",
    "the sine - gordon model is one of the simplest exactly solvable models of interacting relativistic fields , and the bosonic string propagating on @xmath18 is one of the simplest nonlinear string worldsheet theories . on the level of classical equations of motion these two models",

    "let us consider the limit when the string moves very fast .",
    "when the string moves very fast @xmath35 .",
    "as in @xcite we replace @xmath36 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a small parameter . because of ( [ withabsvalues ] ) we should also replace @xmath34 with @xmath39 ; the new field @xmath40 will be finite in the null - surface limit : @xmath41 the string embedding @xmath26 satisfies : @xmath42 the rescaled sine - gordon field @xmath43 satisfies : @xmath44\\psi=      -\\psi+{\\epsilon^2\\over 6}\\psi^3+\\ldots\\ ] ] in the strict null - surface limit @xmath45 and @xmath46 in this limit the string worldsheet is a collection of null - geodesics .",
    "the @xmath27-part is therefore a collection of equators of @xmath27 . for each point @xmath47 on the worldsheet",
    "the intersection of @xmath27 with the 2-plane generated by @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the corresponding equator ; this equator can be parametrized by the vector @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "we have @xmath51 eqs .",

    "therefore in the limit @xmath55 the null - surface is determined by @xmath56 .",
    "it should be possible in principle to extend this analysis to higher orders and find the extremal surface corresponding to the solution @xmath34 of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "the extremal surface is determined by @xmath34 up to the rotations of @xmath27 .",
    "another important limit is the _ plane wave limit . _ to get to the plane wave limit we first go to the null - surface limit ( [ nsl ] ) and then take an additional rescaling @xmath57 . in the strict limit @xmath58 the equations for @xmath59 become linear : @xmath60\\chi=-\\chi\\ ] ]",
    "the plane wave limit is therefore the free field limit .",
    "the canonical poisson structure of the classical string on @xmath18 does not agree with the canonical poisson structure of the sine - gordon model .",
    "but it corresponds to another poisson structure of the sine - gordon model , which is compatible with the canonical one @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian flows generated by the local conserved charges of the sine - gordon model should differ from the flows of the pohlmeyer charges of the classical string only by the relabelling of the charges .",
    "this means that the action variable of the sine - gordon model which we discuss in this paper corresponds to the action variable of the classical string , which is also generated by an infinite linear combination of the local pohlmeyer charges .",
