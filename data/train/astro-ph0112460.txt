    "the issue of whether or not ionizing star clusters are the sources of radiation responsible for the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) and , moreover , for the background radiation at low redshift ( heckman et al 2001 ) , is still controversial .",
    "uv observations of four nearby starburst galaxies ( leitherer et al .",
    "1995 ; hurwitz et al .",
    "1997 ) showed that more than 10% of the ionizing photons could escape from these galaxies . on the other hand , dove et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained from theoretical arguments that 7% of photons produced by ob associations would have to escape into the dig to sustain it and could also be consistent with the estimated flux required to photoionize the magellanic stream ( weiner & williams 1996 ; bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 ) .",
    "all these aspects at low redshift are undoubtedly important to establish whether massive stars in starburst galaxies can rival qso s as sources of the metagalactic background radiation at high redshifts ( z @xmath1 3 ; see ricotti & shull 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , an estimate of the escape fraction at low redshift is to provide an upper limit to the expected escape fraction at high redshift , when the universe was much denser .",
    "beckman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) presented evidence , based on the analysis of the h@xmath2 luminosity function of hii region populations in nearby spiral galaxies , that luminous hii regions may be matter bounded .",
    "this would imply that these regions are an important source of photons to the dig . here",
    "we report strong evidence that points at giant extragalactic hii regions ( gehrs ) to be matter bounded , and thus as an important source of ionization at large distances from their exciting stars .",
    "our conclusions are based on evolutionary synthesis models ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter st99 ) applied to previously analyzed gehrs with observed wolf - rayet ( wr ) features ( daz et al . 2000 ; castellanos et al .",
    "2002 ; hereafter referred to as paper i ) .",
    "the observed parameters inside these regions , i.e. the fluxes and equivalent widths of the wr features , the emission line intensities of [ oii](@xmath33727 ) , [ oiii](@xmath35007 ) , [ nii](@xmath36584 ) , [ sii](@xmath36717 ) , and [ siii](@xmath39069 ) relative to h@xmath0 , the observed h@xmath0 luminosity and equivalent width , can not be fitted simultaneously unless an important fraction of the ionizing radiation escapes from these regions .",
    "the analyzed gehrs are regions h13 in ngc 628 , cdt3 in ngc 1232 and 74c in ngc 4258 .",
    "the three of them , particularly 74c and h13 , show spectral signatures of prominent wolf - rayet features .",
    "the presence of these stars allows to constrain the age of the ionizing clusters to between 3myr and 6myr .",
    "these values depend on the stellar mass loss rates and , consequently , on the stellar metallicity that ultimately controls when massive o stars enter the wolf - rayet phase ( meynet 1995 ) .",
    "this metallicity has been assumed to be similar to that found through the analysis of the emission line spectrum ( see paper i ) .",
    "once the age and metallicity are known , a unique spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be provided by evolutionary synthesis models .    to estimate the age of the ionizing stellar clusters from the measured strength and equivalent widths of the observed wr features we used the models of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 )",
    ". ages between 4 and 4.5 myr , 3 and 3.5 myr and 3.5 and 4 myr are found for regions h13 , cdt3 and 74c with oxygen abundances of 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.5 solar , respectively .",
    "we have then used the st99 models to predict the seds of the ionizing clusters .",
    "these models assume the same stellar tracks as those used by schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) and , at the metallicities here considered , represent a good approach to the ionizing spectra ( see stasiska et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the predicted seds were then used as input to the latest version of cloudy ( ferland 1999 ) .",
    "the models also require of an electron density ( assumed to be constant throughout the nebula ) , the derived gas metallicity ( see paper i ) and an ionization parameter , u = q(h)/(4@xmath4r@xmath5n@xmath6c ) ; where q(h ) is the total flux of ionizing photons emitted by the cluster per second , r the distance from the ionizing source to the illuminated face of the cloud , n@xmath6 the electron density and c the speed of light . in spherical geometry , the average u is proportional to ( q(h)n@xmath7)@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gas filling factor . in the case of ionization",
    "bounded regions , q(h ) must equal , in the absence of dust , the number of ionizing photons derived from h@xmath2 recombinations .",
    "our models have considered values of the ionization parameter between -4.0 @xmath10 log u @xmath10 -2.0 , through the span of the wr phase which , combined with the observed numbers of ionizing photons ( q(h ) ) imply r values of the order of 10@xmath11 cm - 10@xmath12 cm ( @xmath13 30 - 300 pc ) .",
    "the thickness of the ionized gas shell is of the order of 10@xmath14 , less than 10 % of the total dimensions of the region , which results in a plane - paralel geometry .",
    "figure 1 shows the run of the emission line intensities relative to h@xmath0 , and the h@xmath0 equivalent width and luminosity as a function of the ionized gas shell thickness .",
    "the figure also compares the model predictions in each case with the observed values ( horizontal bars ) .",
    "figure 1 clearly shows that a consistent fit to all observed quantities can only be found if the regions are considered to be matter bounded , i.e. only if there is an important escape of ionizing radiation from the nebulae .",
    "models in which all photons are absorbed ( most right - hand points in figure 1 ) lead to large departures from all observed values . however ,",
    "if one assumes the nebulae to be matter bounded , a satisfactory agreement between all predicted quantities and the observations is found at a common distance to the ionizing cluster for each case .",
    "clearly , for these models we have also demanded for consistency with the observed h@xmath2 luminosity which has been found through an iterative process .",
    "successful models have hydrogen column densities of the order of 10@xmath14 @xmath15 while ionization bounded models reach column densities close to 10@xmath11 @xmath15 .",
    "the fraction of escaping photons depends both on their energy and the gas column density .",
    "table 1 gives the main physical conditions of the observed regions .",
    "columns 1 , 2 and 3 identify the gehrs and list the observed metallicity and resultant age of the best fitting models for the ionizing clusters . columns 4 indicates the range in ionization parameter used , and columns 5 - 7 indicate both , the absolute and relative values of the photon flux escaping in three different energy bins ( 13.6 - 24.5 ev , 24.5 - 54.4 ev , and larger than 54.4 ev ) . the log of the total values of photons escaping the nebulae range from 49.80 @xmath10 log q@xmath16(h ) @xmath10 51.51 , which imply an escape fraction between 10% ( for region h13 ) and 73% ( for region 74c ) .",
    "the observed emission lines of gehr have been widely used to derive the properties of the ionizing radiation and link them to those of the stellar populations generating it , but always under the assumption that the ionized region is ionization bounded . in the absence of an independent constraint on the age of this stellar population , such as the presence of wr stars , successful fits to the emission line spectra of most gehr",
    "have been found within a narrow range of ages , between 2 and 2.5 myr ( bresolin et al .",
    "1999 ; dopita et al .",
    "in fact , if similar methods of analysis were applied to the regions modelled here , we would obtain a similar result .",
    "for these regions , however , we have accurate determinations of the gas metallicity and their age , provided by the analysis of the wr spectral features , and therefore we can synthesize the corresponding seds . however , the derived seds are unable to reproduce the observed emission line spectra unless the gehrs are density bounded . in such a case ,",
    "we have shown here that a satisfactory fit can be found in the three analyzed cases .",
    "our results suggest that the leaking of ionizing photons do depend on the evolutionary stage of the regions .",
    "regions 74c and cdt3 show the highest escape fractions , consistent with the prominent observed wr features in the former spectrum , and the high excitation lines ( [ feii ] , , [ feiii ] ) in the latter one .",
    "however , region h13 , which also shows a prominent wr feature , shows a far lower escape fraction which can be understood from its lower metallicity ( 0.2 solar _ versus _ 0.5 solar in 74c and cdt3 ) , affecting the wr phase strength .",
    "it is plausible that large photon escaping fractions might be expected in those regions that experience a hard wr phase , this one depending on both the age and metallicity .",
    "an important implication from the escape of ionizing photons concerns the ew(h@xmath0 ) - age relation , that does not hold for matter bounded regions .",
    "it is a well known fact that few hii regions show ew(h@xmath0 ) as large as those predicted from evolutionary synthesis models ( e.g. melnick , terlevich & eggleton , 1985 ; mas - hesse & kunth 1998 ) .",
    "the leak of lyman continuum radiation provides a natural explanation in the correct direction .",
    "a close analysis of the energy distribution of the escaping radiation ( see table 1 ) shows that the largest fraction has energies between 13.6 and 24.4 ev ( up to 80% in the case of 74c ) .",
    "however , if escaping to incident fractions are considered , helium ionizing photons are clearly dominant ( e.g. up to 84% of the incident photons with energies between 24.4 and 54.4 ev escape from region 74c ) .",
    "this would explain why the observed emission line spectrum is so similar to that produced by a star cluster without wr stars .",
    "furthermore , the derived large amounts of escaping ionizing photons indicate that gehrs and stellar ob associations may significantly contribute to the ionization of the diffuse gas layers observed above the disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "though , to our knowledge , no measurements of the diffuse interstellar gas ( dig ) are available for ngc 628 , ngc 1232 and ngc 4258 , recent studies by ferguson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , oey & kennicutt ( 1997 ) and zurita et al .",
    "( 2000 ) stress the fact that the integrated escaping flux from disk galaxies can attain up to 10@xmath17 erg s@xmath18 , enough to account for the diffuse h@xmath2 flux and fully compatible with our derived values for single gehrs .    in our models",
    "the lower energy photons emitted by the central star cluster are more effectively absorbed by the hii region gas while a large fraction of the photons with energy between 1.8 to 4 ry escape the nebula .",
    "therefore , the resulting spectral energy distribution of the escaping photons is slightly harder than that of the ionizing star cluster .",
    "for the three studied regions the q(he)/q(h ) ratio of the escaping photons is : 0.22 , 0.20 and 0.19 which should be compared to 0.10 , 0.14 and 0.15 for the respective ionizing clusters .",
    "one still unsolved problem for the interpretation of observations of the dig above the galactic disk is the apparently low value of the hei@xmath35876 @xmath19 /h@xmath0 ( reynolds & tufte 1995 ) which would be in contradiction with our derived q(he)/q(h ) ratios .",
    "our studied regions , however , are not representative of galactic hii regions ionized by a single star , but of high luminosity giant extragalactic hii regions on the disks of spiral galaxies like , for example , ngc891 . for the dig in this galaxy",
    "the average value of hei@xmath35876 @xmath19 /h@xmath0 is 0.1 ( rand 1997 ) .",
    "according to bresolin , kennicutt & garnett ( 1999 ) the value of this ratio for stellar effective temperatures between 40000 and 50000 k is highly dependent of metallicity and reaches the value of 0.1 for a metallicity of about 1/4 solar .",
    "in fact , most hii galaxies show values of hei@xmath35876 @xmath19 /h@xmath0 around 0.10 ( izotov & thuan 1998 and references therein ) .    in summary , by applying evolutionary synthesis models to well - studied gehrs with observed wr features , we find that these regions need to be matter bounded in order to reconcile model predictions with observations .",
    "the amount of escaping ionizing photons per unit time from these regions range from 49.80 @xmath10 log q@xmath16(h ) @xmath10 51.51 , which implies an escape fraction between 10% and 73% of the available incident photons .",
    "these fractions seem to increase with both the strength of the wr phase and the metallicity of the ism .",
    "the implication is thus that the mass of the ionizing clusters is larger than the value derived in a straight manner from the observed h@xmath2 luminosity .",
    "it is also clear that the ism is highly non - uniform and that the matter swept up in the shells produced by the mechanical energy deposited by the wr sources and other massive stars is not sufficient to trap the ionization fronts .",
    "this is also the result obtained from numerical calculations that consider both the mechanical energy of massive stellar clusters as well as their ionizing luminosity .",
    "tenorio - tagle et al . ( 1999 ) have shown how once the shell of swept up matter becomes rayleigh - taylor unstable and fragments , as it evolves out of a galaxy disk into the halo ( the blowout phenomenon ) , it then allows not only for the venting of the hot ( wind and sn ) matter into the halo , but also for the leakage of a large fraction of the ionizing radiation .",
    "the latter soon establishes a giant conical hii region in the low density halo .",
    "the low densities in the halo lead to a long recombination time and thus to a large leakage of photons into the igm .",
    "the situation changes later , once the shock is able to sweep enough halo matter , enhancing locally the number of recombinations in the expanding shell .",
    "this leads eventually to the trapping of the ionization front .",
    "consecuently , depending on the stage of the evolution , a large fraction of the ionizing flux escapes the nebulae and is freely available to impact upon the gas at large distances from the host galaxy plane ( collins & rand 2001 ) and it is also likely to escape the galaxy and cause an important ionization of the igm . clearly ,",
    "further analysis of this kind must be done to infer whether or not our derived escape fractions are typical of other gehrs .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for many comments and suggestions which significantly improved the content of the paper .",
