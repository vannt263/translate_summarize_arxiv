    "the gell - mann formula @xcite is a prescription aimed to serve as an `` inverse '' to the inn - wigner contraction @xcite .",
    "let a symmetric lie algebra @xmath2:m , t , m , [ starting_algebra ] and its inn - wigner contraction @xmath3 : = \\{0 } , be given .",
    "the gell - mann formula prescribes that elements @xmath4 can be , loosely speaking , constructed as the following simple function of the contracted algebra operators @xmath5 and @xmath6:t = i [ c_2(m ) , u ] + u. [ gm_general ] here , @xmath7 denotes the second order casimir operator of the @xmath8 subalgebra , @xmath9 is a normalization constant and @xmath10 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "this formula was introduced by dothan and neeman @xcite and advocated by hermann . for a mathematically strict definition , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this formula is of a great potential value due to its simplicity and the fact that many aspects of the representation theory are much simpler for the contracted groups / algebras ( e.g.  construction of representations @xcite , decompositions of a direct product of representations @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "however , this formula is valid , on the algebraic level , only in the case of contraction from @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 to @xmath13 , with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , apart from this , the formula is also partially applicable in a broad class of other contractions provided one restricts to some classes of the algebra representations .",
    "the validity of gell - mann s formula in a weak sense , when an algebra representation requirement is imposed as well , was investigated long ago by hermann @xcite .",
    "a partial set of classes of the algebra representations for which the gell - mann formula holds is listed @xcite .",
    "no attempt to make this list exhaustive is made , deliberately concentrating `` on what seems to be the simplest situation '' .",
    "this analysis excluded , from the very beginning , the cases of representations where the little group ( in wigner s terminology ) is non - trivially represented , not claiming a complete answer even than .    the aim of this paper is to clarify the matters of the gell - mann formula applicability for the class of @xmath0 algebras contracted w.r.t .",
    "their @xmath15 maximal compact subalgebras .",
    "note , that owing to a direct connection of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 algebras , the conclusions readily convey to the latter case .",
    "apart from pure group - theoretical reasons , this problem is strongly motivated by physical applications of the gell - mann formula to the areas of gravity and @xmath16-brane physics .",
    "the representations of the @xmath17 groups and their algebras , and , in particular , of their double coverings @xmath18 ( whose spinorial representations are necessarily infinite - dimensional ) , are of interest @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "the solution of the labeling problem of the @xmath18 groups representations is only a starting point . by a rule , a detailed information about the matrix elements of the noncompact operators in a basis of the maximal compact subgroup @xmath19 , a representation content of the @xmath19 sub - representations etc .",
    "is required .",
    "the gell - mann formula offers a powerful method to describe various representation details in a simple closed analytic form .",
    "in this paper , rather then following the approach of hermann @xcite , we work in the representation space of square integrable functions over the maximal compact subgroup @xmath19 , with a standard invariant haar measure : @xmath20 .",
    "this representation space is large enough to provide for all inequivalent irreducible representations of the contracted group , and is also rich enough to contain representatives from all equivalence classes of the @xmath18 group , i.e. @xmath0 algebra , representations @xcite .",
    "the generators of the contracted group are generically represented , in this space , as follows .",
    "the @xmath15 subalgebra operators act , in a standard way , via a right group action : @xmath21 the abelian operators @xmath22 act multiplicatively as wigner @xmath23-functions ( the @xmath24 group matrix elements expressed as functions of the group parameters ) : u_|u| d^_x(g^-1 ) , [ uisd]@xmath25 being a constant norm , @xmath26 being an @xmath24 element , and @xmath27 denoting the symmetric second order tensor representation of @xmath24 . the @xmath28 vector from representation @xmath27 space",
    "is denoted by the index of the operator @xmath22 , whereas the vector @xmath29 can be an arbitrary vector belonging to @xmath27 ( the choice of @xmath30 determines , in wigner terminology , the little group of the representation in question ) .",
    "taking an inverse of @xmath26 in ( [ uisd ] ) insures the correct transformation properties .",
    "a natural discrete orthonormal basis in the @xmath19 representation space is given by properly normalized functions of the @xmath19 representation matrix elements:\\{|    l@l j & + k & m    > d^j_km(g^-1 ) dg |g } ,   = _ jj_kk_mm , [ naturalbasis]where @xmath31 is an ( normalized ) invariant haar measure . here",
    ", @xmath32 stands for a set of @xmath19 irreducible representation labels , while the @xmath33 and @xmath34 labels numerate the representation basis vectors .",
    "an action of the @xmath15 operators in this basis is well known , and it can be written in terms of the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the @xmath19 group as follows ,    = = _ jj c. [ maction ]    the matrix elements of the @xmath22 operators in this basis are readily found to read : = |u| = |u| c c [ uaction ] . a closed form of the matrix elements of the whole contracted algebra @xmath35 ( a semidirect sum of a @xmath36 dimensional abelian algebra and @xmath15 ) representations is thus explicitly given in this space by ( [ maction ] ) and ( [ uaction ] ) .",
    "moreover , we introduce the so called , left action generators @xmath37 as : k _",
    "g^ d_^m _ , [ koperator]where @xmath38 is the cartan metric tensor of @xmath24 . the @xmath39 operators behave exactly as the rotation generators @xmath40 , it is only that they act on the lower left - hand side indices of the basis ( [ naturalbasis ] ) :    = = _ jj",
    "c. [ kaction ]    the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 mutually commute .",
    "however , the corresponding casimir operators match and , in particular , we will use @xmath41 in the expression for the gell - mann formula ( [ gm_general ] ) .",
    "the gell - mann formula validity problem is due to the fact that the third commutation relation of ( [ starting_algebra ] ) is not a priori satisfied as an operator relation when the algebra elements are given by expressions ( [ gm_general ] ) . in the @xmath0 case , the @xmath42 subspace is spanned by @xmath43 of , so called , shear generators @xmath44 .",

    "the @xmath49 operator here denotes the second order casimir operator acting in the tensor product of two @xmath27 representations , i.e.  @xmath50 .",
    "the summation index @xmath32 in ( [ tt_calc ] ) runs over all irreducible representations of the @xmath19 group that appear in the tensor product @xmath51 , and @xmath52 count the vectors of these representations . since all irreducible representations terms , apart those for which the clebsch - gordan coefficient @xmath53 is antisymmetric w.r.t .",
    "@xmath54 vanish , we are left with only two values that @xmath32 takes : one corresponding to the antisymmetric second order tensor @xmath55 and the other one corresponding to the representation that we denote as @xmath56 .",
    "the fact that in the case of @xmath0 algebras , there is another representation term , in addition to @xmath55 , in the antisymmetric product of two @xmath27 representations ( i.e. representations that correspond to abelian @xmath57 operators ) , is in the root of the gell - mann formula validity problem . note that in the case of the @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 ) contractions , where the gell - mann formula works on the algebraic level , the contracted @xmath57 operators transform as @xmath60 and the antisymmetric product of two such representations certainly belongs to the @xmath55 representation and closes upon the @xmath14 subalgebra .",
    "the @xmath15 casimir operator values satisfy @xmath61 , implying that one of the two terms vanishes in ( [ tt_calc ] ) when @xmath62 , leaving us with : & 12 ^ 2[t_,t _ ] = 4(n+2 ) _ , ",

    "as the coefficient @xmath9 can be adjusted freely , all that is needed for the gell - mann formula to be valid is that ( [ tt_fin ] ) is proportional to the appropriate linear combination of the @xmath19 generators , as determined by the wigner - eckart theorem , i.e.:~_c^ _  m_= _ , i c^ _   d^_i k_i .",
    "[ tt_cg ] an analysis of this requirement leads to a chain of conclusions that we summarize briefly .",
    "the third term in ( [ tt_fin ] ) , containing @xmath23 functions of the representation @xmath56 , is to vanish .",
    "since it is not possible to choose vectors @xmath30 so that this term vanishes identically as an operator , the remaining possibility is to restrain the the space ( [ naturalbasis ] ) of its domain to some subspace @xmath64 .",
    "more precisely , for this term to vanish , there must exist a subalgebra @xmath65 , spanned by some @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 . requiring additionally that this subspace ought to close under an action of the shear generators , and that the first two terms ought to yield ( [ tt_cg ] )",
    ", we arrive at the following two necessary conditions :    1 .",
    "[ req1 ] the algebra @xmath68 , must be a symmetric subalgebra of @xmath15 , i.e.*[l , n ] n , [ n , n ] l ; n = l^ , * 2 .",
    "the vector @xmath29 ought to be invariant under the @xmath69 subgroup action ( subgroup of @xmath19 corresponding to @xmath68 ) , i.e.k",
    "_ k_| + c + x + > = 0 .",
    "the space @xmath70 is thus @xmath71 . in wigner",
    "s terminology , this means that @xmath69 is the little group of the contracted algebra representation , and that necessarily it is to be represented trivially . besides , the little group is to be a symmetric subgroup of the @xmath19 group .",
    "this coincides with one class of the solutions found by hermann @xcite .",
    "however , now we demonstrated that there are no other solutions in the @xmath0 algebra cases , in particular , there are no solutions with little group represented non trivially .",
    "as for the first requirement , an inspection of the tables of symmetric spaces , yields two possibilities : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , and , for @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( @xmath57 is the unitary group ) .",
    "however , this second possibility certainly does not imply another solution , since it turns out that there is no vector satisfying the second above property .",
    "thus , _ the only remaining possibility _ is as follows , l = spin(m)spin(n - m ) , m = 1 , 2 ,  , n-1spin(1)1 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that proportionality of ( [ tt_fin ] ) and ( [ tt_cg ] ) really holds in this case .",
    "the vector @xmath76 exists , and it is the one corresponding to traceless diagonal @xmath77 matrix @xmath78 .",
    "the approach presented in this paper allows us also to write down explicitly the matrix elements of the @xmath0 generators in the cases when the gell - mann formula is valid .",
    "the possible cases are determined by the numbers @xmath79 and @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding representation space ( not irreducible in general ) is the one over the coset space @xmath80 .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath9 is determined to be : = 12 , and , in a matrix notation for @xmath27 representation : |    c + x    > = diag(1 m ,  , 1 m , -1n - m ,  , -1n - m ) .",
    "the gell - mann formula ( [ gm_general],[gell - mann_in d terms ] ) , and the matrix representation of the contracted abelian generators @xmath57 ( [ uaction ] ) yield :    c = [ taction ] + ( c_2(j ) - c_2(j ) + ) c c .",
    "the zeroes in the clebsch - gordan coefficient here denote vectors that are invariant w.r.t .",
    "@xmath81 transformations ( in that spirit @xmath82 ) . in the formula ( [ taction ] ) ,",
    "the space reduction from @xmath20 to @xmath83 implies a reduction of the basis ( [ naturalbasis ] ) , i.e. @xmath84 ( only the vectors invariant w.r.t .  left @xmath85 action remain ) .",
    "the expression ( [ taction ] ) , together with the action of the @xmath19 generators ( [ maction ] ) provides an explicit form of the @xmath17 generators representation , that is labeled by a free parameter @xmath10 .",
    "such representations are multiplicity free w.r.t . the maximal compact @xmath19 subgroup , and all of them are tensorial .",
    "in this paper , we clarified the issue of the gell - mann formula validity for the @xmath86 algebra contraction .",
    "we have shown that the only @xmath0 representations obtainable in this way are given in hilbert spaces over the symmetric spaces @xmath80 , @xmath87 . moreover , by making use of the gell - mann formula in these spaces , we have obtained a closed form expressions of the noncompact operators ( generating @xmath88 cosets ) irreducible representations matrix elements . the matrix elements of both compact and noncompact operators of the @xmath0 algebra are given by ( [ maction ] ) and ( [ taction ] ) , respectively .",
    "in particular , it turns out that , due to gell - mann s formula validity conditions , no representations with @xmath15 subalgebra representations multiplicity can be obtained in this way .",
    "moreover , the matrix expressions of the noncompact operators as given by ( [ taction ] ) do not account for the @xmath0 spinorial representations . due to mutual connection of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 algebras ,",
    "the results of this paper apply to the corresponding @xmath1 case as well .",
    "the @xmath89 generators differ from the corresponding @xmath0 operators by the imaginary unit multiplicative factor , while the spinorial representations issue in the @xmath1 case is pointless due to the fact that the @xmath90 is a simply connected ( there exists no double cover ) group .",
