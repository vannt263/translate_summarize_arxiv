    "blue supergiant stars were first identified with fast x - ray transients discovered by _ asca _ ( ax  1845.00433 , @xcite ) and later by _ rxte _",
    "( xte  j1739302 , @xcite ) . as more began to be discovered with",
    "_ integral _",
    ", they were recognised as a class @xcite and named supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) @xcite .",
    "sfxts are thought to be a subclass of x - ray binary in which a neutron star accretes the wind of a supergiant companion .",
    "some binaries with these two components have been known since the 1970s as very bright and variable x - ray sources ( e.g. , vela  x-1 , 4u  1700377 ) , but the sfxts spend most of their time at low luminosities of @xmath0 to @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , with only very brief excursions to outburst luminosities of up to a few times @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "these outbursts generally last for several hours , with subpeaks lasting for minutes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the cause of this behaviour is not known .",
    "clumps in the wind of the companion can explain rapid variability within outbursts @xcite , but are less successful at explaining long periods of quiescence . in some cases",
    "a highly eccentric or wide orbit may be responsible @xcite , but some sfxts have been shown to have orbits as short as the persistently bright sources ( see table  1 ) .",
    "rejection of the wind material by the magnetic propeller effect @xcite has been suggested .",
    "depending on the particular systems studied and the assumptions made about the accretion physics , consideration of the propeller effect has led to both high lower limits ( @xmath4  g ) @xcite and low upper limits ( @xmath5  g ) @xcite on the magnetic field .",
    "unexpected structure in the companion wind itself , e.g. very rare clumps with a very high density contrast , has not yet been ruled out .",
    "some sources have been referred to as intermediate between sfxts and the familiar persistent supergiant / neutron star binaries , but this category has never been universally defined . the most common criterion for `` intermediateness '' mentioned in the literature is the dynamic range between the highest and lowest luminosities observed . `` intermediate '' sources by this criterion have been defined as either those with a dynamic range of @xmath6100 but @xmath720 or so @xcite or those with a range of 1001000 @xcite .",
    "the maximum dynamic range of any source  both the sfxts and the classical wind - accreting hmxbs such as vel  x1  can only increase with the number of observations made .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the most recent of these references give the higher range for intermediate systems , since the known dynamic ranges of all the objects have increased in recent years .",
    "@xcite adds two additional criteria to the definition of intermediateness : a higher average luminosity than the canonical sfxts , and a longer average duration for individual flares . @xcite",
    "add the criterion that the lowest luminosity frequently observed should be close to @xmath8 erg  s@xmath2 for intermediate systems , and 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower for true sfxts .",
    "@xcite have begun to make the sfxt vs. intermediate classification systematic for the first time by interpreting histograms of the luminosity of three sources , xte  j1739302 , igr  j175442619 , and igr  j164794514 made from monitoring data from the sensitive _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .",
    "the difference between true sfxt and intermediate systems in that work is based on the fraction of time spent at the lowest luminosities .",
    "we present data from the galactic bulge scan programme @xcite of the proportional counter array ( pca ) instrument on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _",
    "pca is a large - area x - ray detector with a collimated but non - imaging field of view of 1@xmath9 full width at half maximum .",
    "twice a week , pca scans the inner galaxy in a raster pattern , recording the instantaneous 210  kev count rate of a large catalogue of sources .",
    "the bulge scan data are publicly available .                                    in this paper we show data from the two prototype sfxts xte  j1739302 and igr  j175442619 ( fig .  1 & 2 ) , the persistently bright wind accretor 4u  1700377 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , three supergiant binaries that are not as well studied and have been considered either sfxts or intermediate systems ( sax  j1818.61703 , ax  j1845.00433 , and igr  j164794514 , fig .  4 , 5 , and 6 , respectively ) , and finally two fast transients",
    "whose companion type and nature are not known : xte  j1743363 and xte  j1901 + 014 ( fig .  7 and 8) . for each source",
    "we present four complementary views of the data : the 210  kev light curve from up to 12 years of bulge scans , a lomb - normalised periodogram used to search for orbital periodicity , an integral histogram of the luminosities , and the autocorrelation function of the light curve .",
    "the light curves can be considered reliable at relatively high count rates , but near zero counts the results are complicated by the systematic limitations of the technique of fitting the count - rate time profiles of the raster scans . for example , systematic uncertainties in the profile of the galactic diffuse emission ( much of which may be an ensemble of many faint cataclysmic variables and other stars  see @xcite ) translate to uncertainties in the lowest source count rate .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for ax  j1845.00433 ( fig .",
    "5a ) , where the bifurcated appearance of the baseline values is caused by the alternation of scans parallel and perpendicular to the galactic plane . the very large error bars for igr  j164794514 ( fig",
    ".  6a ) are due to the proximity of the bright low - mass x - ray binary gx  340 + 0",
    ". we therefore can not draw conclusions about the fluxes of the latter two objects outside of outburst .",
    "the counts shown are normalised to be the expected 210  kev count rate if all five detectors making up the pca were turned on . in practice , from one to five detectors are on at any given time , and this will be reflected in varying error bars from point to point . in these units , the crab would be on the order of 10000 counts s@xmath2 .",
    "the second panels ( b ) of fig .",
    "18 show the lomb - normalised periodogram of the data , used to search for orbital periods .",
    "the gray horizontal line represents the largest expected value for each period in @xmath10 randomised trials ( the real data values were randomly reassigned to the real data acquisition times in each trial and the periodogram taken ) .",
    "the output of the simulations has a slightly different maximum value for each value of period , but there is no significant dependence of the sensitivity on period ; the variation looks like noise and does not maintain repeatable features when the initial random number seed of the full set of randomised trials is changed . thus we replace the noisy sensitivity level of the simulations with a constant value equal to the average of all the period bins to give the line shown , which is the 99.99 per cent significance threshold for the case of a known period .",
    "the third panel ( c ) of each figure shows an integral luminosity histogram ( the fraction of measurements above each flux value ) , with the fluxes calculated from the count rates using the pca instrument response and the distances shown in table  1 ( where more than one distance is cited , the first is used ) .",
    "systems with no good distance estimate ( xte  j1901 + 014 and xte  j1743363 ) have been placed at 3  kpc , a distance typical of the estimates for sources that have them .",
    "if the nature of these two objects is completely different from that of the supergiant binaries , their distances could be quite different as well .",
    "for example , if either is a cataclysmic variable , the distance and luminosity could be much less .",
    "observation of most of these sources in the galactic bulge is probably due to the region being well observed rather than any physical association with the bulge populations ; note that the distances derived for the sources with known companions are all well in the foreground of the galactic centre ( table  1 ) . in these panels ,",
    "the gray lines shown for comparison are the integral of a normal distribution centred at zero whose standard deviation is equal to the average error bar for the lowest 20 per cent of flux observations from each source . this represents the expected distribution if there were no real flux from the source but only random noise .",
    "finally , the last panel ( d ) of each figure gives the autocorrelation function of the data for each system . to generate this curve , we interpolated the time history of each system on to a 1  dy uniform grid , setting all the values to zero during the long gaps that occur each year when the sun passes too close to the source .",
    "the autocorrelation function was calculated on the interpolated grid .",
    "since the source sampling is usually at approximately 3.5  dy , these plots are only informative at times longer than that .    in table  2",
    "we present three different measures of the percentage of time that each source is active . considering the range of behaviours and luminosities among the sources , no single measurement of what it means for a system to be `` active '' or `` in outburst ''",
    "is universally sufficient , nor do we expect one of these three definitions to be useful for every purpose . the first measure is the percentage of time spent with a flux of at least three standard deviations above zero ; the standard deviation in this case is defined by averaging the lowest 20 per cent of the error bars from all the bulge scan fits .",
    "these errors are partly statistical and partly based on fitting uncertainties from the influence of other nearby sources . in general , the lowest 20 per cent of the errors correspond to times when the source is undetectable to the pca , with the exception of the sources that are almost always visible , such as 4u  1700377 .",
    "the second measure is the percentage time that the source is above 40  counts  s@xmath2 ( 210  kev , five detectors equivalent ) , giving a constant threshold in observed flux .",
    "the last measure is the percentage of time spent at a luminosity above 1@xmath11  erg  s@xmath2 at the first listed distance to each source shown in table  1 .",
    "bulge scan count rates ( 210  kev ) are converted to energy flux ( also 210  kev ) by assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with temperature 20  kev , typical of sfxts , and using the webpimms tool at nasa s high energy astrophysics science archive research centre ( heasarc ) ( http://heasarc.nasa.gov/tools/w3pimms.html , retrieved 18 april 2011 ) .",
    "any of these can be used as a simplified activity parameter , but more information is contained in the full luminosity histograms ( panel  c of fig .",
    "table  2 also gives the average and maximum luminosity of each source , the average value for the bottom half of luminosity measurements , and the average of the bottom 20 per cent of luminosity uncertainties .",
    "the latter number serves two purposes : first , to make it clear when the average of the bottom half of luminosity is significantly above zero ( only for 4u  1700377 and xte  j1901 + 014 ) , and second , to give the luminosity threshold used for the first activity index : e.g. , xte  j1739302 spent 4.8 per cent of its time with a flux above @xmath12  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "the negative average luminosities for the bottom half of observations in igr j175442619 and igr j164794514 are due to the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the background - subtracted pca count rates .",
    "negative values in these cases just indicate that in a typical measurement , the uncertainties due to subtracting both instrumental background and the influence of other sources are greater than the typical count rate of the source .",
    "@xcite showed luminosity histograms for three sources ( differential instead of integral ) , but summarised these results with an _ inactivity _ measurement instead .",
    "that was most appropriate for their data set , which is only 2 years long  and therefore contains fewer outbursts  but very sensitive , since the _ swift _ xrt is a true imaging instrument .",
    "thus they have good discrimination between low and very low emission levels .",
    "the _ rxte _ pca bulge scan data are not as easy to interpret at the lowest fluxes , even though pca is also very sensitive , due to complications in interpreting the scan data due to the structure of diffuse x - ray emission in the galactic ridge . on the other hand , the pca data set contains over 4000 pointings covering over 12  yr for some of the sources we include , so that our database is the most sensitive to the distribution of the rarer high fluxes .

    "@xmath19 @xmath20 normalised to 10@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 at 10  kpc @xcite .            in hopes of getting further insight into the nature of this source",
    ", we examined twelve archived _",
    "rxte_/pca pointings , some from 2000 , when it was often bright , and some from 2007 , when it was much less active ( see fig .",
    "table  4 shows the dates , _ rxte _ observation identification numbers , and count rates for these pointings .",
    "11 shows some sample light curves and fig .",
    "12 shows the power spectrum made by averaging the power spectra from five of the observations .",
    "four observations made on mjd 54115 showed low and nearly identical count rates of 1.92.0 counts s@xmath2 and no variability .",
    "the flux varied during all the other observations on time - scales of seconds to minutes .",
    "we used xspec version 12.5.1 to fit the pca spectra .",
    "these four quiet observations included an iron line of high equivalent width , and no detectable interstellar absorption above 3  kev , in contrast to all the other observations , which showed significant and variable absorption .",
    "finally , the count rates of the four spectra from mjd 54115 are comparable to the flux level that is identified as diffuse from the pca bulge scans in this region . taking all this evidence together",
    ", we believe it quite likely that during these four observations we were seeing only the galactic diffuse component and not the source itself .",
    "the best - fitting continuum spectrum to these four observations together was an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum of temperature @xmath22  kev and normalisation @xmath23 , defined as    @xmath24    where d is the distance to the source in centimetres and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electron and ion densities per cubic centimetre at the source @xcite .",
    "an iron line of equivalent width 0.43  kev and centre energy ( @xmath27 )  kev was also required ( at 3.7@xmath28 ) , and was consistent with being narrow , although the width was poorly constrained ( @xmath62.9  kev ) . in fitting the rest of the spectra",
    ", we included these two spectral components with no free parameters .",
    "no further iron line was needed in any of the other fits .    in table  4",
    "we show the spectral parameters of the remaining flux , presumed to be from xte  j1743363 itself .",
    "for most of the spectra , an absorbed optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum provided a good fit .",
    "we used the tuebingen - boulder ism absorption model ( tbabs ) @xcite .",
    "for the three spectra with the best counting statistics , however , an additional component was necessary to obtain @xmath29-square values consistent with chance .",
    "a thermal blackbody spectrum served this purpose well for all three spectra , as it typically does for accreting neutron stars .",
    "table  5 shows the resulting fit parameters in this case . including the blackbody component has the effect of raising the temperature of the bremsstrahlung component and reducing the best - fitting absorption column .",
    "it is apparent from tables  4 and 5 that the absorption column is both high and variable , and therefore local to the system .",
    "this suggests a companion with a dense wind , which can be characteristic of both blue supergiants and red giants such as agb stars . the absorption column does nt seem to correlate with luminosity at all , suggesting that the absorption is taking place in foreground structures in the wind rather than in the concentration of material accreting on to the compact object at the moment .",
    "@xcite used the infrared colours of 2mass  174301333622221 to constrain the spectral type of the companion , but not severely ; they found that a giant of type g06 , a g or k supergiant , or a supergiant earlier than o9 were all consistent with the 2mass colours , assuming varying degrees of reddening .",

    "we obtained a far - red spectrum of the counterpart using the andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) on the 2.6  m nordic optical telescope ( not ) in la palma , spain , on the night of 2009 june 27 .",
    "the instrument was equipped with a thinned @xmath31 pixel e2v ccd , covering a field of view of @xmath32 with a spatial scale @xmath33/pixel .",
    "we used grism # 4 with a @xmath34 slit , providing a resolving power @xmath35 . in order to remove fringing ,",
    "an internal flat was taken at the target position .",
    "because of the southern declination of the target , it was observed at a very high airmass ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , as the finder image ( fig .",
    "14 ) shows , image quality was good .",
    "2mass  j17430133@xmath373622221 can be clearly resolved into two objects , separated by @xmath38 , both of which fell within the slit .",
    "the fainter object is a normal g / k star .",
    "the brighter star is a very red object , and the obvious counterpart to the 2mass source .",
    "its spectrum ( fig .",
    "15 ) is dominated by deep molecular bands .",
    "in particular , we see deep bandheads of tio , typical of m - type stars .",
    "@xcite have shown that the depth of the tio 8859bandhead is a very good indicator of effective temperature .",
    "though the resolution of our spectrum is too low to use it as a @xmath39 calibrator , the fact that its depth is @xmath40 of the continuum immediately shortward indicates that it is not a dwarf star . only giants and supergiants present such deep molecular features .",
    "it also indicates that the spectral type is later than m6 .",
    "this is confirmed by the detection of vo bandheads , which are only visible at spectral types m7 and later @xcite .",
    "the deep depression of the continuum in the 74007550  and 78608050  regions can only be due to the presence of strong vo bands of the extreme red system , as there are no telluric features in these two regions .",
    "moreover , the vo bandhead at 8624  is also likely detected .",
    "though a better spectrum is needed to obtain an accurate spectral type , the data are not very different from the expectation for spectral type m8 . as supergiants with such a late spectral type are very rare @xcite , the object is very likely a giant .",
    "the fundamental properties of such late stars are not well calibrated . for m8iii stars , @xcite estimate @xmath41  k , though this is an extrapolation from earlier spectral types .",
    "their fit to the intrinsic @xmath42 colour indicates values between @xmath43 and @xmath44 at this temperature .",
    "as @xcite find @xmath45 on average for m8iii giants , their infrared absolute magnitude is @xmath46 .",
    "late m - type giants may be close to tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) or on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "many giants later than m6 are brighter than the tip of the rgb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has observationally been set at @xmath47 @xcite , and so most m8iii giants are likely on the agb .",
    "theoretical magnitudes calculated from phoenix models and calibrated against observational data suggest that all late - m giants have @xmath48 @xcite , in good agreement with extrapolation of the colour calibration of @xcite .",
    "the calibration of @xcite , based on older models , gives @xmath49 for dust - free m8 stars .",
    "this reference also gives @xmath50 for dust - enshrouded m7 stars .",
    "based on this , our target can not be dust - enshrouded , unless the insterstellar extinction is negligible .",
    "this possibility is ruled out by the non - detection in all msx bands except for a , and so we assume that the star is not surrounded by dust .",
    "therefore its colour excess is @xmath51 . for a standard reddening law , @xmath52 and so",
    "the distance modulus should be @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54  kpc .",
    "as observations of lmc giants suggest that @xmath55 may deviate by @xmath56  mag from the average at a given @xmath57 @xcite , we may settle for @xmath58  kpc , though there are many other sources of uncertainty not considered in this error estimate .",
    "for instance , these calculations assume that the star has characteristics typical of m - type giants in the solar neighborhood .",
    "our upper distance limit , however , brings us close to the distance to the galactic bulge . at @xmath59 ,",
    "the extinction to our source is not incompatible with galactic bulge membership @xcite , even if we take into account the possibility of bluer colours for bulge m - giants @xcite .",
    "however , for a distance of 8.5  kpc , the source would have @xmath60 , only compatible with the very brightest bulge m - type stars @xcite .",
    "our target would then have to be a thermally - pulsating agb .    even in the most likely case that the star is foreground to the bulge",
    ", it is likely to be variable , as most late - type giants are long - period variables .",
    "their amplitude in the _ k _ band is generally small and unlikely to dominate our error budget . on the other hand ,",
    "photometric determination of a pulsation period would be the most direct way to evaluate the stellar luminosity and hence distance .",
    "the spectral identification of the companion to xte  j1743363 as a late m giant puts the system in the small group of symbiotic x - ray binaries , although we have not seen an additional hot component to the optical spectrum , which was the origin of the term `` symbiotic '' . for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "16 the pca bulge scan data for gx  1 + 4 , a known symbiotic x - ray binary in which an x - ray pulsar orbits an m giant .",
    "@xcite used infrared spectroscopy to derive an orbital period of 1161  dy , a luminosity of 1270  @xmath61 , and a distance of 4.3  kpc , which we assume to scale the luminosity distribution in fig .  16 . comparing gx  1 + 4 with the data for xte  j1743363 in fig .  7 , we see two things in common : a noticeable autocorrelation out to 100  dy ( while even the very bright blue supergiant system 4u  1700377 only correlates out to 30  dy ) and a long quiet period ( for gx  1 + 4 , the years 2007 and 2008 and for xte  j1743363 the last 5  yr ) .",
    "these common characteristics lend support to the spectroscopic evidence that xte  j1743363 is also a symbiotic binary .",
    "strong emission lines in the optical spectrum and pulsations of gx  1 + 4 have been taken as evidence of an accretion disc @xcite .",
    "while these characteristics have not been seen in xte  j1743363 , we note that our far - red spectrum of xte  j1743363 was taken in the middle of the extended x - ray quiet period still in progress .",
    "it is possible that a disc forms when the source is x - ray active .",
    "the time variability of xte  j1743363 also resembles that of a member of another class of binary entirely : the ultracompact binary 4u  051340 in globular cluster ngc  1851 .",
    "it also shows highly variable emission , correlations over many days , and a relatively quiet period of approximately three years @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopy of the counterpart rules out this possibility , unless the correct companion is the faint , nondescript g / k star nearby .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that a star as unusual as the m8 giant would coincide with the x - ray source by accident , while it is quite likely that the dwarf star would do so .",
    "this system showed a short ( @xmath62  hr ) , bright ( 0.9  crab ) x - ray outburst at the time of its discovery by @xcite .",
    "it has since shown further outbursts @xcite but seems to have a relatively high flux in quiescence as well @xcite compared to the sfxts @xcite .",
    "it does not have an ir / optical counterpart bright enough to be a supergiant in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "although we did nt see an outburst in the bulge scan data , we confirm the presence of a nonzero quiescent baseline that is not consistent with the behaviour of the sfxts in our sample .",
    "@xcite , using pointed observations of the _ rxte _ pca , showed that there is a great deal of variability ( by more than a factor of two over tens of seconds ) even outside of outbursts .",
    "they quoted a typical flux of 2.7  mcrab outside of outburst .",
    "our average luminosity of 5.72 @xmath63 erg  s@xmath2 at an arbitrary distance of 3  kpc corresponds to 5.3 @xmath64 erg  s@xmath2 or a bit over 2  mcrab , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the persistent emission outside of outburst supports the more definitive evidence of the lack of a supergiant companion in separating this source from the class of sfxts .",
    "the nature of the system remains a mystery .",
    "the authors thank sebastian drave for his assistance in identifying an independent set of outbursts of xte  j1739302 from those used in @xcite and for useful discussions .",

    "<S> in x - ray binaries , rapid variability in x - ray flux of greater than an order of magnitude on time - scales of a day or less appears to be a signature of wind accretion from a supergiant companion . when the variability takes the form of rare , brief , bright outbursts with only faint emission between them , the systems are called supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present data from twice - weekly scans of the galactic bulge by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ that allow us to compare the behaviour of known sfxts and possible sfxt candidates with the persistently bright supergiant x - ray binary 4u  1700377 . </S>",
    "<S> we independently confirm the orbital periods reported by other groups for sfxts sax  j1818.61703 and igr  j175442619 . </S>",
    "<S> the new data do not independently reproduce the orbital period reported for xte  j1739302 , but slightly improve the significance of the original result when the data are combined . </S>",
    "<S> the bulge source xte  j1743363 shows a combination of fast variability and a long - term decline in activity , the latter behaviour not being characteristic of supergiant x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> a far - red spectrum of the companion suggests that it is a symbiotic neutron star binary rather than a high - mass binary , and the reddest known of this class : the spectral type is approximately m8iii .    </S>",
