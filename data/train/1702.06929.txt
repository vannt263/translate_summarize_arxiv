    "to study electromagnetic production of strangeness from a nucleon is important in hadron physics because it provides information about the interaction between nucleon and hyperon as well as the static properties of hyperon .",
    "there has been a growth of empirical data dedicated to the study of the hyperons and their resonances produced by hadronic and electromagnetic probes .    of these , the reaction @xmath12 is an interesting process in both sides of theory and experiment because the reaction process involves the production of the negative - parity hyperon - resonance of spin-3/2 via the process @xmath13 .",

    "the contributions of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the @xmath2-channel exchange are analyzed and the role of the @xmath18 [ previously called @xmath19 is identified in the resonance region .    on the other hand , it has been an issue to determine the @xmath20 coupling constant from the present process because it could give a hint on our understanding of the structure of the @xmath7 resonance . in refs .",
