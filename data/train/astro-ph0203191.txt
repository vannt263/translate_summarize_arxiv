    "tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole in a galactic nucleus has been investigated by many authors .",
    "early seminal investigations by @xcite and @xcite were followed up with detailed analytical studies @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "a tidal disruption event is expected to produce a luminous flare of electromagnetic radiation in the uv to x - ray band .",
    "@xcite argued that a convincing detection of a tidal disruption event must fulfill the following three criteria : ( 1 ) the event should be of short duration ( a `` flare '' ) ; ( 2 ) it should be very luminous ( up to @xmath0 erg  s@xmath1 at maximum ) ; ( 3 ) it should reside in a galaxy that is otherwise non - active ( in order to exclude an upward fluctuation in the mass accretion rate of an active nucleus ) .",
    "_ rosat _ observations have led to the discovery of four x - ray flaring `` normal '' galaxies that fulfill the above criteria [ summarized in @xcite ] : ngc  5905 , rxj1242 - 1119 , rxj1624 + 7554 , rxj1420 + 5334 ; plus a possible fifth candidate : rxj1331 - 3243 .",
    "all these galaxies have exhibited large x - ray flares ( peak luminosity up to @xmath2 erg  s@xmath1 ) , corresponding to a significant amplitude of variability ( up to a factor @xmath3 ) , an ultra - soft x - ray spectrum ( @xmath4 kev , where @xmath5 is the temperature derived from a black - body fit to the spectral data ) , and no signs of seyfert - like activity in the optical .",
    "these flares are promising candidates for tidal disruption events @xcite .",
    "a uv flare has also been detected at the center of a mildly active elliptical galaxy , ngc  4552 , with a bolometric luminosity @xmath6 erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "since the luminosity is several orders of magnitude less than would be expected from complete tidal disruption of a star , the event has been explained as the tidal stripping of a stellar atmosphere @xcite .    among the five galaxies listed above ,",
    "long - term follow - up observations exist only for ngc  5905 @xcite . in this paper , we model the light curve of ngc  5905 assuming that the flare was produced by the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole .",
    "we compare theoretical predictions with the observational data and constrain the properties of the progenitor star ( e.g. , its mass and radius ) and estimate how much mass was accreted by the black hole .",
    "a giant x - ray flare in ngc  5905 was detected by _",
    "rosat _ in july 1990 @xcite .",
    "the observed peak x - ray luminosity exceeded @xmath7 erg  s@xmath1 , and the x - ray spectrum was very soft ( photon index @xmath8 , or a very cool black - body with @xmath9 kev ) .",
    "follow - up observations were made in 1990 and 1993 with the pspc , and in 1996 with the hri @xcite .",
    "the observational data are listed in table [ tab1 ] . assuming a hubble constant @xmath10 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , the count rates may be converted to luminosities , which are plotted with error bars in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the two downward arrows are upper limits .",
    "the light curve after the initial burst gradually declines with time . during the x - ray outburst as well as at later times",

    "the x - ray flux rose steadily ( see table 1 ) , strongly suggesting that this epoch corresponded to the onset of the flare . for a start time of @xmath18 yr",
    ", the total x - ray energy released during the entire outburst event is @xmath19    a black - body fit to the x - ray spectrum during the outburst gives a temperature @xmath20 kev , and an intrinsic ( @xmath21 kev ) mean luminosity @xmath22 erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "integrating the black - body spectrum over all energies ( from zero to infinity ) , the bolometric luminosity is @xmath23 .",
    "thus , if the spectrum does indeed have a black - body form , the bolometric correction is not very significant .",
    "then , the total mass associated with the released energy may be estimated to be @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the efficiency of converting mass to radiated energy .",
    "this mass estimate is similar to that for the uv flare in ngc  4552 @xcite .",
    "note that our estimate of @xmath26 depends only weakly on the assumed power law index @xmath27 in equation ( [ lum2 ] ) .",
    "this is because the observed light curve extends over a long enough time to capture most of the emission in the flare .",
    "the estimate of @xmath28 suffers from the uncertainty in the bolometric correction ( which we have taken to be unity ) .    in models of thin accretion disks around black holes ,",
    "the color temperature @xmath5 of the emitted radiation is generally higher than the effective temperature @xmath29 , defined by flux @xmath30 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath5 from @xmath31 is caused by electron scattering and comptonization ( ross , fabian & mineshige 1992 ; shimura & takahara 1993 , 1995a , 1995b ) .",
    "writing @xmath32 , the factor @xmath33 can be estimated from detailed self - consistent models of the radiative transfer in the disk .",
    "it is found that the value of @xmath33 depends on both the mass of the black hole ( compare shimura & takahara 1993 and 1995b ) and the mass accretion rate .",
    "shimura & takahara ( 1993 ) present results for a @xmath34 black hole emitting at a radius of 5 schwarzschild radii , which is similar to the conditions we expect in our problem . depending on the accretion rate",
    ", they obtain values of @xmath33 in the range @xmath35 ( see their fig . 4 and the associated discussion ) , with the highest value of @xmath33 being obtained for near - eddington rate accretion .",
    "in what follows , we retain the factor @xmath33 in the equations , and we substitute a value of 3 whenever we require a numerical estimate .    including the factor @xmath33 as defined above , we estimate the radius of the x - ray emitting region of the flare in ngc 5905 to be @xmath36 where we have used @xmath22 erg  s@xmath1 for the mean luminosity during the peak of the outburst @xcite .",
    "the radius we derive is surprisingly small ; even after setting @xmath37 , it is barely equal to the schwarzschild radius of a @xmath38 black hole , whereas an accretion disk is likely to have an effective radiating area @xmath39 times larger .",
    "we return to this point in  5 .",
    "the tidal disruption radius of a star in the vicinity of a schwarzschild black hole is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath42 is the mass of the star , @xmath43 is the radius of the star , and @xmath44 is a dimensionless coefficient .",
    "the exact value of @xmath44 is uncertain , though physically we expect it to be of order unity .",
    "we assume @xmath45 in our modeling .",
    "the ratio of @xmath46 to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole , is @xmath49 for a solar - type star with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "in such a case the star will be swallowed whole by the black hole , without a tidal disruption event @xcite .",
    "after a star is tidally disrupted , there are two distinct stages in the dynamical evolution of the debris , each with its own time development and luminosity :    \\(1 ) the fallback stage @xcite : a fraction of the material in the disrupted star remains gravitationally bound to the black hole and falls back to the pericenter , giving rise to a mass accretion rate ( and a luminosity ) evolving with time as @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the returning material shocks and then circularizes to form an orbiting torus around the black hole at a radius @xmath55 ( by angular momentum conservation ) , where @xmath56 is the pericentric radius .",
    "the total energy radiated during the fallback is given by @xmath57 , where @xmath28 is the fallback mass .",
    "this energy can be less than the energy released in the subsequent viscous accretion stage discussed below .",
    "nevertheless , since the fallback stage is relatively short - lived , it dominates the early luminosity of a disruption event .",
    "\\(2 ) the viscous accretion stage @xcite : the torus formed from returning debris gradually spreads inward and outward from @xmath58 under the action of viscosity , and gives rise to a mass accretion rate ( and a luminosity ) evolving with time approximately as @xmath59 . the energy radiated during this stage is given by @xmath60 $ ] , where @xmath61 is the radius of the last stable circular orbit ( @xmath62 schwarzschild radii for a non - spinning black hole ) .",
    "the accretion occurs on a viscous time scale , which is typically very long compared to the fallback time ( cannizo et al .",
    "1990 ; ulmer 1999 ; appendix a of the present paper ) .",
    "therefore , this stage is expected to last a long time , up to hundreds of years , depending on the magnitude of the viscosity in the disk , and the luminosity is significantly lower than that associated with the fallback stage ( appendix [ appa ] ) .    in the case of ngc  5905",
    ", the x - ray luminosity was seen to rise rapidly during the first epoch of observations at @xmath63 yr , indicating that the flare probably began around that time ( see table 1 and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the luminosity then dropped by more than a factor of @xmath64 between @xmath63 yr and @xmath65 yr . such a rapid decline indicates that the observed outburst of ngc  5905 could not have been due to the accretion phase , but must have corresponded to the fallback stage ( if it indeed was a tidal disruption event ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper we assume that the flare in ngc  5905 corresponds to the fallback stage of tidal disruption .",
    "let us assume that the center of the star follows a nearly parabolic orbit ( i.e. , the binding energy of the star to the black hole is close to zero ) , and for definiteness let us assume that the pericenter of the orbit is at @xmath66 , i.e. that the parameter @xmath67 defined below in equation ( [ omgs ] ) is equal to unity . since the specific energy at the center of the star is @xmath68 , the orbital velocity of the star at pericenter is @xmath69 , and the spread in the specific energy of the disrupted debris , @xmath70 , is governed by the variation of the black hole gravitational potential across the star , and the spin - up of the star as a result of the tidal interaction @xcite .",
    "if @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 where @xmath73 depends on the spin - up state of the star . if the star is spun up to the break - up spin angular velocity , we have @xmath74 .",
    "on the other hand , if the spin - up effect is negligible , then we have @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "since the spin - up velocity is always @xmath76 , the energy used to spin up the star is much less than the orbital kinetic energy of the star , and the stellar orbit remains parabolic to a very good approximation .",
    "the spin - up of a star via tidal interaction is a complex process . in linear perturbation theory ,",
    "the spin - up angular velocity is given by @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 in our problem , @xmath79 is the orbital angular velocity of the star at the pericenter , @xmath80 is the stellar momentum of inertia in units of @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the second tidal coupling coefficient which is a function of @xmath67 . in equation ( [ omgs ] ) we have assumed that @xmath71 . for a main sequence star of mass @xmath83 and radius @xmath84 , @xcite give @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which implies that @xmath87 if @xmath88 . for an @xmath89 polytrope star ,",
    "they give @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which corresponds to @xmath92 . furthermore",
    ", they show that numerical simulations that include non - linear effects lead to a larger energy transfer from the orbit to the star and a larger spin - up than predicted by linear theory . for these reasons",
    ", we feel that it is likely a tidally disrupted star will be spun up to nearly the break - up limit , with @xmath93 and @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath94 for most of our analysis ; however , for completeness we also present a few results for the non - spinning case @xmath95 .",
    "part of the disrupted star has positive energy and escapes from the system , and part remains bound .",
    "the bound material follows a highly eccentric orbit and returns to the central black hole after completing one orbit .",
    "the flare begins when the most bound material , with specific energy @xmath96 , returns .",
    "the time since disruption for this to happen is given by @xmath97 where we have used @xmath66 and @xmath94 .",
    ", then the spin - up effect will be less important and we will have a smaller @xmath73 ( but @xmath73 is still @xmath98 ) , which will give rise to a @xmath99 that is somewhat larger than that given by eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "] material that is less bound takes a progressively longer time to return , and the overall light curve is determined by the distribution of debris mass as a function of binding energy .",
    "@xcite assumed that the debris is uniformly distributed in mass between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have shown that this is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the bound material then returns to pericenter at the rate @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the time of the initial tidal disruption , @xmath28 is the actual mass that falls back to pericenter , which is a fraction @xmath104 of the original mass of the star , and @xmath105    in rees original model , the whole star is disrupted and half the debris is on bound orbits , so that @xmath106 .",
    "however , a recent numerical simulation shows that not all the returning material is captured by the black hole : about @xmath107 of the returning mass becomes unbound following the large compression it experiences on the way back @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a smaller @xmath108 .",
    "another possibility giving rise to a small @xmath104 is that the star is only partially disrupted : its envelope could be stripped by the black hole , leaving most of its core nearly intact ( renzini et al . 1995 ; see also  5 below ) .",
    "here we treat @xmath104 as a free parameter .",
    "the gravitational potential energy available from fallback is determined by the difference between the specific binding energy of the circularization orbit at @xmath109 and the specific binding energy of the incoming material . since @xmath71 ,",
    "all the bound debris is on highly eccentric orbits with a specific binding energy much smaller than the binding energy of the final circular orbit .",
    "thus , assuming that the fallback material radiates the energy release promptly , the radiation efficiency @xmath25 is independent of time during fallback : @xmath110 the luminosity of the fallback process is then given by @xmath111 the luminosity peaks at @xmath112 , i.e. when the most bound debris falls back to the pericenter , so we have @xmath113",
    "in  [ sec2 ] we have fitted the decline of the ngc  5905 light curve to a @xmath12 law , and obtained the result given in equation ( [ lum2 ] ) with a disruption time of @xmath114 yr .",
    "the fit is acceptable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and the time at which the light curve reached its peak is fairly well constrained . since the initial measurements at @xmath115 yr showed flux rising with time , the maximum in the light curve was clearly later than this time . at the same time , the maximum could not have been later than 1990.56 yr , since the fitted light curve in ( [ lum2 ] ) falls below @xmath116 erg  s@xmath1 at that time .",
    "thus , the light curve fit gives @xmath99 within the range 0.18 to 0.20 yr , where @xmath117 is the time lag between the peak of the light curve and the moment of tidal disruption .",
    "however , there is an error of @xmath118 yr on each limit .",
    "therefore , we use conservative bounds on @xmath99 @xmath119    > from the discussion in  [ sec2 ] , the mass involved in the outburst of ngc  5905 is only @xmath120 .",
    "we therefore consider the following two possibilities for the candidate stellar object disrupted in ngc  5905 :    \\(1 ) a low mass star ( lms ) , whose radius and mass are related by @xmath121 @xmath122 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) a substellar objects ( ssos , including brown dwarfs and planets ) , whose radius and mass are related by @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) @xcite , but a comparison with their plot shows that the fit is acceptable even for lower masses .",
    "we apply their scaling down to @xmath125 . ] .    substituting these two radius - mass relations into equation ( [ t1 ] ) and noting the limits on @xmath99 in equation ( [ t1l ] ) , we find that the black hole mass in ngc 5905 and the mass of the disrupted star",
    "are restricted to the two relatively narrow shaded bands shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the figure makes use of an additional constraint , namely a lower limit on the tidal radius @xmath46 .",
    "if the black hole is not rotating , then the smallest distance to which a star on a parabolic orbit can approach and yet not be captured by the black hole is @xmath126 , where @xmath127 . if we have a maximally rotating black hole and if the angular momentum of the stellar orbit is parallel to the spin of the black hole , then the closest approach possible is @xmath128 .",
    "the real situation is probably in between these two limits , so we use a fiducial limiting radius of @xmath129 . using equation ( [ rth ] ) , we have calculated relations connecting @xmath41 and @xmath42 for all three limiting radii and plotted them as dotted lines in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the mass of the black hole in ngc 5905 is not very well constrained , but it is believed to be in the range @xmath130 @xcite , based on the correlation between bulge blue luminosity and black hole mass for spiral galaxies @xcite and on the correlation between bulge velocity dispersion and black hole mass for ellipticals and spirals @xcite .",
    "this information is sufficient to constrain the mass of the disrupted star fairly tightly : the mass must be either in the range @xmath131 in the case of a sso or @xmath132 in the case of a lms .",
    "the result , however , depends sensitively on the choice we make for the tidal spin - up parameter @xmath73 discussed in  2 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] has been calculated for @xmath133 , a reasonable and possibly likely value , but in principle @xmath73 could be as small as 1 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows how the mass constraints change when we use the latter value .",
    "we see that the allowed range of models is limited to somewhat lower black hole masses , unless the black hole spins very rapidly and allows tidal disruptions down to @xmath134 .",
    "we do not discuss the @xmath95 case further .",

    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig2 ] correspond to @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "we see that , for the case of a lms , @xmath104 must be @xmath139 , which means that an unusually small fraction of the star must have participated in the fallback . for the case of a sso , somewhat larger values of @xmath104 are obtained ( but still rather small ) .",
    "in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] we plot the luminosities given by equation ( [ rees_lum ] ) for different values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath104 , where the disrupted object is assumed to be a lms ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and a sso ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) , respectively , and the disruption time is taken to be @xmath140 yr .",

    "we confirm that , in order for the models to fit the observational data , a very small @xmath104 ( @xmath145 ) is required for the case of a lms ( fig .",

    "we see that the ratio @xmath156 is significantly larger than unity if the color temperature factor @xmath157 , and it is not much less than unity even if @xmath158 ( the likely value ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result in the next section .",
    "the x - ray light curve of the flare in ngc  5905 agrees with the @xmath159 dependence predicted for fallback of debris after tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . if the black - body fit presented in bade et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is a good representation of the spectrum of the emission , then the bolometric correction to the x - ray flux is not very large and the observed light curve gives a meaningful measure of the energetics and luminosity of the flare .",
    "we note that , during and after the x - ray outburst , the optical brightness did not show any significant variation @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the bulk of the fallback emission probably did occur in x - rays .",
    "( if the flare had substantial hidden emission in the far ultraviolet band , it is hard to see how there could have been no variations in the optical . )    in addition to fallback , a second independent stage of evolution is expected when the circularized fallback material viscously accretes onto the black hole .",

    "obviously , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the central density of the star .",
    "if the star is at a distance @xmath188 from the black hole such that @xmath189 , then only a part of the envelope of the star is peeled off .",
    "one important question is how the core of the star responds when it loses its envelope .",
    "what is relevant is the response on a dynamical time .",
    "webbink ( 1985 ) has calculated the logarithmic derivative of the radius of a main sequence star with respect to mass , @xmath190 , where the subscript @xmath191 indicates that the entropy profile of the star is held fixed ( as appropriate for a dynamical process ) .",
    "consider a star that loses a fraction of its mass as a result of a tidal interaction and assume that it dynamically adjusts to a new equilibrium corresponding to its reduced mass .",
    "if @xmath192 , then the mean density of the new configuration will be higher than the original mean density of the star .",
    "the leftover mass is then stable to further stripping .",
    "however , if @xmath193 , the new configuration will be prone to further tidal mass loss , and one has a runaway situation in which the entire star is likely to be disrupted .",
    "webbink ( 1985 ) shows that @xmath192 for @xmath194 . since this is precisely the mass range of interest if the disrupted star in ngc  5905 was a main sequence star ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , we conclude that partial stripping is a viable possibility . to estimate what fraction of its mass the star might lose ,",
    "consider a star like the sun as an example .",
    "for the sun , the mass inside a radius @xmath195 is @xmath196 , and correspondingly , @xmath197 .",
    "thus , for a range of distances between @xmath198 and @xmath199 ( a non - negligible range ) , such a star will lose only a couple of percent of its mass .",
    "if we assume that 10% of this mass returns via fallback , then we can have @xmath104 as small as @xmath200 .",
    "this is still much larger than the value needed to explain the flare in ngc  5905 , but it is at least within striking distance .",
    "fully convective lower main sequence stars and degenerate brown dwarfs have @xmath201 .",
    "these stars are likely to be fully disrupted in tidal encounters since they expand to a _",
    "larger _ radius as they lose mass .",
    "apart from the small value of @xmath104 , another unexpected result of our analysis is that the peak radiative flux emitted during the flare , @xmath202 , is close to the eddington flux .",
    "( here @xmath5 is the black - body temperature of the radiation and @xmath33 is a color correction factor . )",
    "the results are shown for our models in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "even with @xmath203 (  2 ) , we find @xmath204 ; the value increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath33 ( as @xmath205 ) .",
    "what makes this surprising is that the _ luminosity _ of the source , even at the peak of the flare , is much below the eddington luminosity : compare @xmath206 with @xmath207 .",
    "clearly , the radiation in the flare must have been emitted from a small patch on the source , and the patch must have projected a small solid angle at the central black hole .",
    "this result was anticipated in the model - independent analysis of  2 , where we showed that the effective size of the emitting patch is small compared to the area we might expect if the entire accretion disk out to a few @xmath208 is involved in the emission .",
    "the small size of the emitting region can be understood in analogy with mass transfer binary stars . in the latter systems",
    ", it is known that the cold gas stream from the secondary star impacts the accretion disk at a compact `` bright spot '' on the outer edge of the disk .",
    "most of the radial kinetic energy of the stream is converted to thermal energy near this spot and radiated locally .",
    "the analogy with the tidal disruption problem is close because the returning material after a disruption event comes in similarly as a narrow cold stream @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural that the radiation during the fallback stage should be emitted from a relatively small patch on the source .",
    "the effect is probably even more severe in the tidal disruption problem .",
    "lense - thirring precession may well cause the incoming stream to be misaligned with respect to the orbital plane of the accretion disk @xcite , causing the geometric area of the impact spot to become smaller .",
    "( we note that in binaries the stream appears to skim over the surface of the disk after impacting at the bright spot , thereby increasing the effective area over which the kinetic energy of the stream is dissipated .",
    "this effect would be reduced if the orbit of the stream is not in the plane of the disk . )",
    "having decided that emission from a small patch is natural for this problem , we should next ask whether it is a pure accident that the flux from the patch in the ngc  5905 flare happens to be nearly equal to the eddington flux .",
    "we would like to suggest that it is perhaps not an accident .",
    "imagine a narrow stream with a mass accretion rate @xmath209 impacting on the accretion torus at a radius @xmath46 and over a small patch that subtends a solid angle @xmath210 at the black hole .",
    "let us suppose that the kinetic energy in the stream is thermalized and radiated immediately from the patch .",
    "the radiated flux is locally given by @xmath211 .",
    "what would happen if this flux is greater than the local @xmath151 ?",
    "jeremy goodman ( private communication ) suggests that the super - eddington flux would cause the local radiating atmosphere to puff up and that the radiation would be emitted from a larger patch than the original impact region .",
    "moreover , it would be natural for the radiating patch to self - adjust so that the flux is close to the eddington limit . according to this picture then , the radius @xmath153 estimated in equation ( [ rx ] ) refers to the size of the puffed up atmosphere , while the actual transverse size of the stream is smaller . if the stream is extremely narrow , then the flux would be close to eddington during a significant fraction of the light curve .",
    "equivalently , the black - body temperature of the radiation would remain constant , even while the luminosity decreases .",
    "this picture ( which is predicated on the assumption of a narrow fallback stream ) suggests that most tidal disruption events should be visible in soft x - rays ; the condition @xmath212 , coupled with @xmath158 ( see  2 ) , ensures that the blackbody temperature of the radiation will be @xmath213 ev for a @xmath38 black hole , which is well - matched to x - ray observations .",
    "soft x - ray surveys should thus be well - suited for an investigation of both the frequency of tidal disruption events and the amount of mass accreted in each event . in this connection",
    ", it is interesting that , with the exception of the uv flare of renzini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , all known candidate flares for tidal disruption events have been identified in the x - ray band ( see komossa 2001 for five candidates and choi et al .",
    "2002 for a possible sixth candidate ) .",
    "menou & quataert ( 2001 ) have emphasized that , given current estimates of the rate of tidal disruptions , the nuclei of many nearby normal galaxies should be much brighter than observed if a fair fraction of a stellar mass is accreted by the black hole after each tidal disruption event .",
    "this is not relevant for the late accretion phase of the particular ngc  5905 flare discussed here because , as we have discussed ( see also the appendix below ) , very little mass ( @xmath214 ) returned to the bh in this case .",
    "however , whether we attribute the small amount of mass in the ngc  5905 flare to partial stripping of a star or to the disruption of a substellar object , it does not help to explain the general problem of why nearby galactic nuclei are so faint .",
    "in addition to partial disruptions of the sort that might have occurred in ngc  5905 , we expect total stellar disruptions in significant numbers and these should provide a significant mean mass accretion rate in galactic nuclei .",
    "disruptions of substellar objects only add to the purely stellar disruptions considered to date .",
    "thus , alternative ways of explaining the dimness of nearby galactic nuclei are required ( menou & quataert 2001 ; narayan 2002 ) , beyond the specific scenario outlined here for the giant flare of ngc  5905 .",
    "either the mass must accrete in a radiatively inefficient mode or the accretion must be suppressed or slowed down significantly .",

    "the authors also thank jeremy goodman , bohdan paczyski and the referee for helpful comments .",

    "research was supported in part by nsf grant ast-9820686 .",
    "after circularization , the fallback material from a tidal disruption event will form a torus at a radius @xmath215 .",
    "the torus will then spread out viscously and accrete onto the black hole .",
    "the time - scale for this stage of the evolution is determined by the viscous time - scale @xcite @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the keplerian orbital period , @xmath80 is the standard viscosity parameter @xcite , and @xmath218 is the ratio of the disk height to radius .",
    "it is easy to check that for the case of the flare in ngc  5905 , where @xmath219 , the accretion disk would correspond to the regime of the `` middle disk '' in which electron scattering opacity dominates over the kramers opacity and gas pressure dominates over radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath218 is estimated to be @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath222 , and @xmath188 is the radius in the disk . in equation ( [ h1 ] ) we have neglected a dimensionless factor @xmath223 .",
    "inserting equation ( [ h1 ] ) into equation ( [ tvis ] ) and setting @xmath224 , we obtain @xmath225 the large value of @xmath226 confirms that the flare in ngc  5905 corresponded to the fallback stage , not the viscous accretion stage .    from the discussion in  [ sec3 ] on the fallback and viscous accretion stages associated with a tidal disruption event , the ratio of the total energy radiated during the accretion stage to the total energy radiated during the fallback stage is @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the ratio of the peak of the viscous luminosity to the peak of the fallback luminosity by @xmath228 where equations ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ tvis ] ) have been used .",
    "the extremely large value of @xmath226 and the extremely small value of @xmath229 imply that the accretion stage will never be observed in practice for the particular case of ngc  5905 .",
