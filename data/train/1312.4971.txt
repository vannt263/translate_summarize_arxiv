    "now , for any distinct @xmath454 , we have @xmath455 , while @xmath456 if @xmath457 in @xmath302 and @xmath458 if not .",
    "clearly , any vertex resolves @xmath459 ( as the distances will have different parities ) , so it suffices to consider resolving pairs of vertices of the form @xmath460 and @xmath461 .    if @xmath462 , then clearly @xmath463 resolves the pair @xmath460 and @xmath464 resolves the pair @xmath461 ( and likewise if @xmath121 ) , so we assume that @xmath465 .",
    "since @xmath12 is a resolving set for @xmath302 , there exists @xmath330 where @xmath466 ; without loss of generality , this implies that @xmath467 and @xmath468 , so therefore @xmath469 and @xmath470 , and thus @xmath336 resolves the pair @xmath460 .",
    "similarly , @xmath334 resolves the pair @xmath461 .",
    "hence any pair of vertices of @xmath0 is resolved by a vertex in @xmath453 , and we are done .    immediately , we have the following corollary , which is reminiscent of corollary  [ cor : taylorbabai ] for taylor graphs .",
    "[ cor : symmbabai ] let @xmath0 be the incidence graph of a non - trivial @xmath374 symmetric design where @xmath471 and which has a null polarity .",
    "then we have ( a ) @xmath472 and ( b ) @xmath473 .",
    "let @xmath302 be the strongly regular graph associated with the design ( as in theorem  [ thm : nullpolarity ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : babai ] gives us upper bounds on @xmath474 , and the result follows .    since @xmath0 has @xmath475 vertices , corollary  [ cor : symmbabai ] gives @xmath476 . in cases where @xmath2 and @xmath32 have a linear relationship , babai s stronger bound yields an upper bound of @xmath477 on @xmath474 .",
    "there are a number of infinite families of such designs , in particular arising from hadamard matrices ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  7.4 ) , and also  @xcite ) ; the incidence graphs of such designs therefore have metric dimension @xmath478 .",
    "we remark , however , that theorem  [ thm : nullpolarity ] can never be applied to the incidence graphs of projective planes , since it is known that a projective plane can not admit a null polarity ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.10.1 ) ) .    what happens if we remove the hypothesis that the design has a null polarity ?",
    "is it still true that the incidence graph @xmath0 of a non - trivial symmetric design with @xmath443 has metric dimension @xmath479 ?",
    "do the bounds of corollary  [ cor : symmbabai ] still hold ?    while the method used in the proof of theorem  [ thm : nullpolarity ] depends on the existence of the null polarity ( to exploit the relationship with strongly regular graphs ) , there are instances of parameter sets @xmath374 with multiple isomorphism classes of designs , of which only some have a null polarity , yet all of their incidence graphs have the same metric dimension .",
    "for example , there are five non - isomorphic symmetric designs with parameters @xmath480 , giving rise to four non - isomorphic graphs ; only one of these designs ( the complementary design of the projective geometry @xmath481 ) has a null polarity , yet all four graphs have metric dimension  @xmath134 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) ) .",
    "also , there are three non - isomorphic @xmath451-biplanes , with three non - isomorphic incidence graphs ; again , only one has a null polarity , yet all three have metric dimension  @xmath134 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) ) .",
    "in this paper , we have begun the systematic study of the metric dimension of imprimitive distance - regular graphs . using propositions  [ prop : halving ] and  [ prop : folding ] , combined with the results of babai ( theorem  [ thm : babai ] ) for primitive graphs",
    ", we saw that bounds on the metric dimension of graphs in classes ah912 ( of theorem  [ thm : ah ] ) follow immediately .",
    "the difficult cases are bipartite or antipodal graphs of diameter  @xmath66 ( whose halved or folded graphs are complete ) or graphs of diameter  @xmath217 which are both bipartite and antipodal ( where the folded graph is complete bipartite ) . in sections  [ section : antipodal3 ] and  [ section : incidence ] we obtained some results on these classes , where the diameter is  @xmath66 ; obtaining general bounds for the metric dimension of graphs in these classes remains open .",
    "it seems plausible that the bounds in corollary  [ cor : symmbabai ] should hold for symmetric designs in general , if the requirement on the existence of a null polarity is removed .",
    "the other cases ( namely antipodal covers of complete and complete bipartite graphs ) also have connections with design theory ( see  @xcite ) and this relationship may prove to be useful when studying these cases .",
