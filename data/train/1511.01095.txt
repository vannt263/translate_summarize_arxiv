    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies comprise the largest population of galaxies in the local group , consisting of nearly @xmath9 confirmed members @xcite .",
    "these objects are characterized by their low luminosities , spheroidal shapes , high mass - to - light ratios , and by the absence of appreciable gas or recent star formation @xcite .",
    "line of sight velocity measurements suggest that dsphs have little to no rotation in their stellar populations and velocity dispersion profiles that are nearly flat with radius @xcite .    in the local group ,",
    "dsphs tend to occupy regions close to either the milky way or m31 @xcite . at greater distances from the two massive galaxies ,",
    "the population of dsphs dwindles and gives way to a different class of low - mass galaxies called dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) .",
    "these galaxies have similar luminosities to dsphs , but are distinct most notably in that they have retained some of their gas .",
    "many dirrs also demonstrate disky features and rotation in their hi content @xcite . this",
    " local group morphology - density relation , \" with dsphs found close and dirrs found far from mw and m31 , mimics similar relationships between galaxy shape and distance from the local barycenter found in clusters @xcite .",
    "this , and the fact that both dsphs and dirrs can be fit with exponential light profiles @xcite , is often used to argue in favor of a dwarf irregular transformation - based origin for dsphs @xcite . if , as is commonly understood from classical galaxy formation theory , all galaxies initially form as thin , angular momentum supported disks @xcite , then significant transformation must occur to convert these rotationally - supported galaxies into the puffy , dispersion - dominated dsphs we see today .",
    "the currently - favored mechanism for bringing about this transformation is known as  tidal stirring \" @xcite . according to this model , rotationally - supported dwarfs with exponential stellar disks and high gas fractions",
    "are repeatedly tidally shocked at the pericenters of their orbits .",
    "while ram pressure is primarily responsible for removing gas from the dwarf , it is the repeated tidal shocks that produce the morphological transformation . in general , for low - mass dwarfs ( the majority of those found in the local group ) , this involves the creation of a tidally - induced bar , which transports high angular momentum material to the outer regions of the galaxy where it is subsequently stripped .",
    "this reduces the rotation of the system and transforms the galaxy into a spheroidal , dispersion - supported system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in the tidal stirring model , a galaxy is generally considered to have been transformed into a dsph if it has no ( or very little ) gas , an ellipticity within a specific range ( usually @xmath10 ; greater values of ellipticity indicate a more elongated shape ) , and if the ratio of its line - of - sight rotational velocity to its velocity dispersion , @xmath0 , is below some value ",
    "usually @xmath11 , but as low as @xmath12 .",
    "a number of early simulations investigating this effect had considered infalling dirr models with extremely cold disks ( @xmath13 ) but more recent simulations involve somewhat hotter initial disks   as starting points because @xmath14 is reduced at small radii while @xmath15 might be expected to stay fixed . ] @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while tidal stirring simulations have been successful at producing systems with @xmath17 @xcite , historically it has been difficult to reduce @xmath0 to values @xmath18 found for many observed dwarf satellites @xcite .",
    "the most complete transformations occur for highly eccentric orbits @xcite , at low inclination , and that are mildly prograde ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) .",
    "the high eccentricity in particular allows for shorter orbital times and repeated pericenter passages ( typically @xmath19 , but as many as @xmath20 ) .",
    "short orbital times ( @xmath21 ) and close pericenter distances ( @xmath22 ) have been shown to be particularly important to the transformation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these simulations have often found that the accreted dirr galaxies need to orbit within a milky way host potential for @xmath23 in order to be able to complete the required number of pericenter passages @xcite .",
    "one major issue with any scenario that requires @xmath24 gyr in order to transform a dirr to a dsph is that this is quite long compared to the expected accretion times for satellites derived from cosmological simulations of milky way and local group analogues .",
    "specifically , the overwhelming majority of milky way satellites are predicted to have fallen in less than @xmath25 ago @xcite , with @xmath26 accreted within the last @xmath27 gyr .",
    "only @xmath28 of the @xmath29 classical milky way dwarf satellites are dirrs ( which appear to have fallen in very recently , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they are significantly more massive than the dsph satellites .",
    "this suggests that any environmental transformation associated with dsph formation needs to occur within @xmath30 gyr of accretion @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "at least two dsphs , cetus and tucana , currently exist at large distances from either the milky way or andromeda ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the closest giant , * ? ? ?",
    "they , like the dsphs much closer to their hosts , have little to no gas and their stars are dispersion rather than rotationally - supported ( see below ) . explaining the existence of such distant objects as the result of tidal stirring poses a particularly difficult challenge to the model . due to",
    "this difficulty , @xcite predict that distant dsphs should have systematically higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , it has been shown that dwarfs with highly cored dark - matter profiles undergo faster transformations ( after just @xmath33 pericenter passages , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this reduction in required time spent near the host would be particularly useful in explaining the lack of rotation in an object like leo i , which has undergone only a single pericenter passage at a distance of @xmath34 from the milky way @xcite .",
    "there are other alternative mechanisms for transforming a dirr into a dsph that require the initial galaxy to interact with another object .",
    "dwarf - dwarf mergers can create dsphs @xcite , and the mechanism is satisfyingly similar to models proposed for transforming massive disks into giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose that the spheroidal shapes of dsphs can be reproduced by mergers between dwarf galaxies and lower - mass dark halos , but do not discuss rotation support .",
    "another model , ",
    "resonant stripping \" , posits that a fly - by between a dwarf and a galaxy 100 times its mass can instigate resonances in the smaller dwarf that preferentially strip the stellar material @xcite .",
    "interactions between dwarfs in the local group are common @xcite , but merger - based transformation scenarios fail to explain the  local group morphology - density relation , \" and so are not likely to account for a large fraction of observed dsphs .    given the strict requirements for the tidal stirring mechanism to be effective , it seems reasonable to question the initial conditions used for dwarf galaxies in these models .",
    "the traditional picture of disk galaxy formation was developed for massive galaxies @xcite with virial temperatures @xmath35 , which is well above the expected bulk ism temperature of a cooled gas in a galaxy @xmath36 k. in this case , the pressure support radius of cooled gas will be tiny compared to the angular - momentum support radius .   shrinks , where @xmath37 is a phenomenological proxy that mimics the net effect of velocity dispersion from various feedback effects , such as inefficient cooling , heating by an internal or external ultraviolet ( uv ) background , supernova feedback , turbulent pressure , or cosmic - ray heating , among others @xcite .",
    "] it is in this sense that the disk of a massive galaxy is expected to be  cold .",
    "\" however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kwb ) show , using a simple analytic approximation and hydrodynamic simulations , that low - mass galaxies with shallow potential wells and modest virial temperatures ( @xmath38 ) will tend to have pressure support radii that are comparable to their angular - momentum support radii .",
    "kwb did not look at @xmath0 explicitly , but showed that at low virial mass ( @xmath39 ) , the dispersion - supported component of a galaxy should begin to rival the rotationally - supported component ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as first suggested by @xcite , the above arguments only strengthen if one considers additional ism pressure imparted on small galaxies from internal feedback effects and turbulent motions .",
    "moreover , stars , unlike gas , can never re - cool after their orbits are disturbed by potential fluctuations or mergers .",
    "taken together , these arguments suggest that the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies residing in the field are not necessarily expected to exhibit well - ordered , disk - like motions as seen in their larger cousins .",
    "recently , large samples of stellar kinematic data for local dirr galaxies have become available @xcite .",
    "these data enable more detailed studies of the pressure support in field dwarfs .",
    "in particular , @xcite present a stellar kinematic analysis of seven ( non - satellite ) dwarf galaxies in the local volume , and showed that only one among them ( pegasus ) demonstrates a clear sign of rotation in its stellar population . while they did not explicitly rule out rotation in the other objects , the work of kirby et al . provides some suggestion that a high degree of rotation support is not the rule among isolated dwarfs .    in what follows",
    ", we conduct a systematic search for stellar rotation in local group dwarfs .",
    "we use a bayesian analysis on a large observational sample of dwarfs consisting of twenty eight mw and m31 dsphs , two dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , and ten dwarfs beyond the virial radii of either the mw or m31 ( including two isolated dsphs and eight dirrs ) to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "we confirm previous findings that both the mw and m31 dsphs , with few exceptions , have stellar populations that are not rotating .",
    "we show further that isolated dwarfs in the local group are also largely dispersion - supported , with only two of ten showing strong bayesian evidence for rotation , and seven of ten failing to show even moderate evidence in favor of rotation .",
    "we propose an alternative formation scenario for dsphs galaxies : most dwarf galaxies form initially as puffy , dispersion - supported or slowly rotating systems , and gas removal via ram pressure stripping ( enabled by internal feedback ) is likely the main process that leads to the formation of dsphs .",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of this in a @xmath40cdm  scenario by using the same bayesian analysis to measure the rotation support in four hydrodynamic cosmological zoom - in simulations of _ isolated _ dwarf galaxies run with fire / gizmo .",
    "the star particles in our simulated isolated dwarf galaxies are dispersion - supported , without any interaction with a more massive galaxy , and their ellipticities are also similar to the known dsph population without the need for harassment .    in section [ sec : obs ] , we highlight our observational sample .",

    "we do not account for bars in our model , instead opting to use the same analysis for each galaxy in our sample .",
    "we apply an identical method for calculating @xmath0 to the simulations ( see section [ sec : method ] ) . to calculate the ellipticity values for the simulations , we use a simple method outlined in @xcite for converting two dimensional field data to a single @xmath0 value . for each of the three orthogonal distributions ,",
    "the galaxy is rotated along the axis parallel to the line - of - sight until there is a maximum in the difference between velocity measurements in the left and right hemispheres of the projection plane .",
    "then , after binning the stars in two dimensions , we sum up the effective  flux \" in each bin and weight the bins by their distance from the center of the simulated galaxy , according to this formula : @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the bin centers and we replace flux , @xmath180 , with the number of star particles in that bin .",

    "the black line shows the expectation for self - gravitating objects flattened by rotation @xcite . for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we consider objects that lie above this line to be at least marginally rotationally - supported .",
    "the galaxy ellipticity values were drawn from the literature .",
    "of all the galaxies in our sample , eight have @xmath0 values that are consistent with being supported by rotation , rather than dispersion : coma berenecis , canis venatici ii , andromeda ii , andromeda vii , ngc 147 , aquarius , leo a and pegasus . of these , only and ii ( dsph ) , ngc 147 and pegasus ( dirr ) show rotation at strong significance . the bayesian evidence that aquarius and leo a are rotating is inconclusive or weak ",

    "we also detect sub - dominant rotation at strong significance in ngc 185 , sagittarius , and wlm .",
    "we detect some ( sub - dominant ) rotation in ngc 6822 , but at a lower significance .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of figure [ fig : f1 ] is the distribution of isolated galaxies .",
    "7/10 of the isolated dwarfs in our analysis have @xmath0 vs ellipticity values that are consistent with being dispersion - dominated , while ( 6/10 ) have @xmath4 .",
    "all have @xmath5 this is in stark contrast to the common assumption that dirrs have stellar disks that are smaller versions of their more massive , rotating counterparts .",
    "even the three rotation - dominated systems are only modestly so , with @xmath183 , which is significantly less rotation than a canonical cold disk , and below the values typically assumed as initial conditions for tidal stirring scenarios for dsph formation ( @xmath184 ) @xcite .",
    "our simulated dwarfs are shown as filled gray squares , each displayed at three orthogonal ( but random ) orientations ( for a total of 12 points ) .",
    "the range of simulated ellipticities is consistent with the range of the observed dwarfs .",
    "our simulated dwarfs also have @xmath0 values that are broadly consistent with the data  .",
    "we will need more simulations @xcite to determine whether we can ever achieve the modest fraction of isolated galaxies ( 3/10 ) with @xmath185 that we see among isolated local group dwarfs .",
    "if not , then this may suggest that the star formation is too bursty , or that the specific feedback implementation causes too much coupling between the injected energy and both the stellar populations and the dissipationless dark matter at the hearts of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows @xmath0 vs. stellar mass for all of the objects in our sample .",
    "no obvious trend with stellar mass is seen , though we note that 4/6 systems with @xmath186 all have @xmath187 .",
    "@xcite show that more luminous ( @xmath188 ) dsphs in the virgo cluster form an extension of local group dsphs in the sersic index-@xmath189 plane , and @xcite find a wide range of @xmath0 values for subset of the virgo dwarfs ( @xmath190 ) , but both of these studies rely on photometry from diffuse light .",
    "extending our analysis ( using resolved stellar populations ) to higher mass objects , both observed and simulated , would be useful in detecting either a trend between of @xmath0 and @xmath7 at higher mass , or a discontinuity between dsphs / des and rotating disks .",
    "however , at least on the observational side , this analysis may have to wait for the next generation of telescopes .",
    "an initial analysis of one slightly more massive ( @xmath191 ) simulated dwarf run with the same code at slightly lower resolution , shows that it is also dispersion - supported ( @xmath192 ) , but more runs at higher mass are needed in the simulations to make a stronger statement about mass trends .",
    "the @xmath0 values estimated by our model and listed in table [ tab : tableobs ] are lower limits to the intrinsic amount of rotation support for each galaxy .",
    "this is due to the fact that the line of sight velocity we measure is @xmath88 .",
    "we can correct for the actual measured inclination of at least those ( 6/10 ) galaxies with measured inclination angles in hi : aquarius ( @xmath193 ) , pegasus ( @xmath194 ) , wlm ( @xmath195 ) , ic1613 ( @xmath196)@xcite , leo a ( @xmath197 ) @xcite , and ngc 6822 ( @xmath198 ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite estimate an inclination of @xmath155 for leo t by matching their simulations to the galaxy s photometric light profile . with these inclination values , the estimated @xmath0 value for aquarius changes from @xmath199 to @xmath200 , for ic 1613 from @xmath201 to @xmath202 , for leo a from @xmath199 to @xmath203 , for ngc 6822 from @xmath204 to @xmath205 , for pegasus from @xmath206 to @xmath207 , for wlm from @xmath208 to @xmath209 , and for leo t from @xmath210 to @xmath211 . none of the estimated @xmath0 values move from @xmath212 to @xmath213 and , of the four galaxies without measured inclinations , vv 124 has the highest @xmath0 value ( @xmath214 ) , and would still have @xmath215 for inclination as low as @xmath216 .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that inclination severely affects the primary result presented in this work  that dwarf galaxies do not form as cold , rotating disks with @xmath217 .",
    "another way of evaluating the effect of inclination on the estimated line of sight @xmath0 values is to infer something about the distribution of three dimensional rotation in our sample by comparing the observed distribution ( @xmath218 ) to what would be measured for a given @xmath219 viewed in projection from random orientations . is independent of viewing angle , which is a good approximation for dispersion - supported objects . for rotationally supported objects ,",
    "if @xmath15 is larger in the plane of the disk compared to vertically , as is the case for the milky way , the result of a face - on viewing angle will have less of an effect than described here . ]",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : incl ] , the observed distribution of @xmath0 for satellite galaxies ( thick solid black line ) closely matches the distribution of @xmath220 ( dashed magenta line ) , but with a slight tail out to higher intrinsic rotation values .",
    "the multiple ( 1000 ) gray lines indicate the possible distributions of @xmath0 if each data point is selected from a gaussian distribution centered on the @xmath0 values from our model , and with standard deviations also taken from the model ( @xmath221 errors ) .",
    "the distribution of line of sight @xmath0 values for the isolated dwarfs ( thick dash - dotted cyan line ) lies just outside of this  error band \" for satellite galaxies , with a distinct excess at @xmath222 .",
    "the isolated galaxy distribution more closely matches a distribution of @xmath223 ( dotted magenta line at @xmath224 ) , but falls far short of matching the ( thin dash - dotted magenta ) @xmath225 line .",
    "while it appears that the isolated sample has more intrinsic rotation than the satellite sample , the isolated sample remains only marginally rotationally supported , with none as cold as @xmath226 , the value commonly used in tidal stirring simulations .     on the sky if all galaxies are assumed to have an intrinsic @xmath0 value of @xmath227 ( dashed magenta line ) , @xmath228 ( dotted magenta line ) or 3.0 ( thin dash - dotted magenta ) , but are viewed with a random inclination .",
    "the thick solid black ( thick dash - dotted cyan ) line shows the distribution of estimated median @xmath0 values for the satellites ( isolated dwarfs ) in our sample .",
    "the error in the satellite distribution is illustrated with 1000 thin gray lines , each consisting of points drawn randomly from gaussian distributions with parameters taken from the estimated values for each of the 29 dsphs in our sample .",
    "for clarity , the error is not shown for the distribution of isolated galaxies , but has a wider spread than the lines for the satellite population .",
    "the isolated distribution is distinct from the satellite distribution , and more closely tracks @xmath229 .",
    "however , it is clear that the @xmath230 values for the isolated galaxies are much less than 3 , the commonly used value in tidal stirring simulations . ]",
    "a clear prediction made by the tidal stirring model of dsph formation is the increase of @xmath0 with increasing distance from a more massive galaxy @xcite .",
    "because the most distant galaxies in the local group could have had no more than one pericenter passage in a hubble time ( and most are expected to have had none , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we would expect that galaxies that lie beyond the virial radius of either giant to have larger @xmath0 values if tidal stirring plays the primary role in shaping dwarf galaxy dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig : dist ] explores this possibility by showing @xmath0 vs. distance from the closest massive local group galaxy ( mw or m31 ) .",
    "we do not see any clear trend between @xmath0 and distance to a massive galaxy , as would be expected if multiple close pericenter passages were necessary for removing rotation from dwarf galaxies .",
    "given the lack of trend between @xmath0 and distance , we are more inclined to suspect that the stars in small galaxies are formed in a medium with marginal rotation support , and undergo merely a modest transformation to become dsphs .",
    "some further evidence for this comes from @xcite , who study @xmath231 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and @xcite .",
    "they suggest the existence of a critical stellar mass , @xmath232 , below which all galaxies become systematically thicker .",
    "one important question that will need to be investigated with future simulations is whether or not galaxies that start out with @xmath233 can undergo enough of a transformation to match the near zero values observed for the smallest dwarf satellites within the infall time constraints provided by cosmological simulations .",
    "although it is likely that a mild transformation in @xmath0 would take much less than the @xmath25 required by tidal - stirring simulations , it would be instructive to use mildly dispersion - dominated dwarfs  in particular at slightly higher mass than those presented here  as the initial conditions for those models .",
    "an initial study has been performed by @xcite , who perform tidal stirring simulations on a gas - dominated , cosmological dwarf with a larger vertical scale height ( aspect ratio @xmath234 ) resulting from stellar feedback - driven turbulence in the star - forming gas . in this work ,",
    "the thicker dwarf reaches @xmath235 in just under 2 pericenter passages , without the typical bar formation and subsequent buckling common in tidally - induced transformations .",
    "additional work along these lines should prove particularly informative .",
    "we have checked to see if the four observed  rotating \" systems are distinct in other properties that might help explain why they have @xmath0 values that are @xmath213 .",
    "these objects do not appear to be significant outliers in metallicity , inner density , star formation history or star formation rate , but a more thorough search for galaxy properties that do correlate with @xmath0 would be useful .",
    "in addition to explaining the small number of outlying observed dwarfs , it could further explain why most of the simulated galaxies fail to demonstrate an elevated @xmath0  perhaps all simulated halos were selected in a way that disfavors the property that best correlates with rotation support .",
    "@xcite do find that aquarius and leo a qualify as  slow \" dwarfs , having formed in a low density environment which leads to a small fraction of their stars forming early , followed by continues star formation until the present time .",
    "this is in contrast to  fast \" dwarfs that form the majority of their stars in a single , early burst .",
    "however , our simulated dwarfs were preferentially selected to inhabit low density environments , and yet have low @xmath0 values .",
    "additional simulations selected from a variety of environments would be useful to test these effects .",
    "all stars analyzed in this work are either red giant or horizontal branch stars , so it is unlikely that we are biasing our sample due to stellar ages . a separate analysis of stellar populations with varying ages  in both the observations as well as the simulations",
    " would likely be informative , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have performed a systematic bayesian search for stellar rotation in 40 dwarf galaxies ( @xmath1 ) in the local group , using resolved stellar kinematic data from the literature .",
    "we find that the vast majority of these galaxies ( @xmath2 ) have @xmath0 values that imply dispersion - supported kinematics .",
    "in particular , we find that 6/10 isolated dwarfs in our sample have @xmath236 , and all have @xmath237 ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) .",
    "this result for the most distant lg dwarfs galaxies contrasts the common assumption that dwarf galaxies form with cold , rotationally - supported stellar disks ( with @xmath238 ) .",
    "we find no strong trend of @xmath0 with @xmath7 within the mass range studied ( figure 2 ) , nor any trend of @xmath0 with distance from large host galaxy in the local group ( figure 3 ) , as would be expected if tidal stirring scenarios drive a kinematic transformation of stars in dirr galaxies to dsph galaxies over multiple pericenter passages .",
    "taken together , our results suggest that dwarf galaxies form as puffy stellar systems that either dispersion - supported , or only mildly rotation - dominated .",
    "the conversion of a dirr galaxy into dsph galaxy may involve little more than the removal of its gas , and a resulting mild decrease of its @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , the process of gas stripping itself may be enough to shock the potential , transforming a stellar system with @xmath239 into a system with @xmath240 .",
    "detailed simulations of this kind will be needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "the formation of initially dispersion - supported systems is more likely to occur within dark matter halos with shallow potential wells ( kwb ) , especially if explosive feedback effects act to dynamically heat stellar populations after the stars form .",
    "we have examined @xmath0 in four cosmological zoom - in simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies that include such explosive feedback events @xcite .",
    "these simulated dwarfs have @xmath241 values that lie very close to extrapolated abundance - matching relations @xcite , so the total amount of energy injected to the surrounding medium is likely appropriate .",
    "however , the strength and frequency of bursts could modify the fraction of energy that couples to stars and dark matter , and so could be driving the stellar kinematics .",
    "all but 2 of the 12 viewing angles for the simulated dwarfs show ( mock - observed ) stellar dispersion support values @xmath242 ( and ellipticities @xmath243 ) , and all are completely consistent with our derived properties of observed satellite dwarfs and isolated dwarfs without a significant need for harassment from a massive neighbor .",
    "while these simulations are certainly not the final word on the formation of dwarf galaxies , the result suggests that it is at least reasonable to posit that dwarf galaxies are generally born moderately hot and are never strongly rotationally - supported .",
    "the comparison between our model isolated dwarfs and the data did reveal one source of potential tension : none of our simulated dwarfs have stellar rotations that are as high as the highest in our sample ( the 3/10 isolated galaxies with @xmath244 ) .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , given the small number of simulations analyzed here , but if this discrepancy holds in the face of better data and more simulations , it could point to a new test for feedback models . in particular",
    ", it is via bursty and violent feedback episodes that the dark matter cores in these halos are reduced in density , thus alleviating potential problems with @xmath40cdm  like the too big to fail problem @xcite . as first pointed out by @xcite , the same outbursts also inject significant random energy into the stellar populations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a more detailed comparison between simulated and observed @xmath0 values may offer an interesting direction in testing models that attempt to solve dark matter problems via explosive feedback episodes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "can these same models preserve the mild stellar rotation that is seen in some isolated dwarfs ? or , is stellar rotation only seen in galaxies with cuspy density distributions , which would be an important prediction of such models ?",
