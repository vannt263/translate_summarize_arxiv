    "molecular - based magnetic materials have recently attracted considerable interest and study of the magnetic properties @xcite . a special class of the these materials , the so - called prussian blue analogs , such as ( x@xmath5mn@xmath6[cr@xmath7(cn)@xmath8.nh@xmath9o ( x@xmath10=ni@xmath10,fe@xmath10 ) @xcite and ( ni@xmath5mn@xmath11fe@xmath12)@xmath13[cr@xmath7(cn)@xmath8.nh@xmath9o @xcite which exhibit many unusual properties , for instance , occurrence of one @xcite or even two @xcite compensation points , magnetic pole inversion @xcite , the photoinduced magnetization effect @xcite , inverted magnetic hysteresis @xcite .",
    "these ternary alloys have ferromagnetic - ferrimagnetic properties since they include mixed both ferromagnetic ( @xmath14 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath15 ) superexchange interactions between the nearest - neighbor metal ions",
    ". the theoretical investigations of these systems are difficult because of their structural complexity .",
    "however , to obtain magnetic properties of the molecular - based magnetic materials , up to now , these systems have been studied by using effective - field theory @xcite , mean field theory @xcite and monte carlo simulation ( mc ) methods @xcite .    in this study",
    "we consider three dimensional ferro - ferrimagnetic ab@xmath0c@xmath1 ternary alloy , consisting of three different ising spins a=3/2 , b=1 , and c=5/2 , which corresponds to the prussian blue analog of the type ( ni@xmath5mn@xmath6[cr@xmath7(cn)@xmath8.nh@xmath9o @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the coupling cr - ni is ferromagnetic and mn - cr is antiferromagnetic .",
    "our aim , in this study , is to clarify the effects of the concentration and the interaction parameters on the magnetic behavior of the three dimensional ternary alloy model by using mc simulation method .",
    "three dimensional ferro - ferrimagnetic ab@xmath0c@xmath1 ising model consists of two interpenetrating cubic sublattices as seen in fig.1 .",
    "it can be assumed that the a ions are located on the first cubic sublattice and the b and c ions are randomly distributed on the second cubic sublattice with the concentration @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . also , to construct a hamiltonian for this system , the ion a can be represented by spin s@xmath2 , and on the other hand , ions b and c can be represented by ising spins s@xmath3 and s@xmath4 , respectively",
    ". if the interactions between nearest neighbors can be chosen such as a ions ferromagnetically interact with b , on the other hand , antiferromagnetically interact with c ions , thus , spins of the prussian blue analog of the type ( ni@xmath5mn@xmath6[cr@xmath7(cn)@xmath8.nh@xmath9o can be represented by this model where s@xmath2 , s@xmath3 and s@xmath4 correspond to cr , ni and mn , respectively . in this study we also consider next - nearest neighbor interactions between spins s@xmath2 .    the hamiltonian of the considered system can be written in the form",
    "@xmath18 \\nonumber\\\\ -j_{aa}\\sum_{<nnn>}s_{i}^{a}s_{k}^{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where s@xmath19 for a , s@xmath20 for b and s@xmath21 for c , on the other hand , @xmath22 is a random variable which takes the value of unity if there is a spin x ( s@xmath3 or s@xmath4 ) at the site @xmath23 , if it not is zero . in eq.(1 ) , the first sum is over the nearest - neighbor and the second one is over the next - nearest neighbor spins . in this hamiltonian",
    "the nearest neighbor interactions are chosen as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the next - nearest neighbor interactions are chosen as @xmath26 .    in order to show the effects of the concentration @xmath16 and the interaction parameters on the compensation and critical temperature of the three dimensional ternary alloy model",
    ", we simulate the hamiltonian given by eq.(1 ) . to simulate this model , we employed metropolis monte carlo simulation algorithm @xcite to the @xmath27 three - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "one of the cubic sublattice is fully decorated with spin s@xmath2 , and spins s@xmath3 and s@xmath4 are randomly distributed on the other cubic sublattice with the concentration @xmath16 or @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "all initial spin states in the @xmath27 three - dimensional lattice are randomly assigned .",
    "configurations are generated by making single - spin - flip attempts , which were accepted or rejected according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "to calculate the averages , data , over 20 different spin configuration , is obtained by using @xmath33 monte carlo steps per site after discarding @xmath34 steps .",
    "the sublattice average magnetizations per site are obtained by    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 denotes the number of b ions @xmath39 , whilst @xmath40 represents the number of c ions @xmath41 on the same cubic lattice .",
    "total magnetization per site is given by @xmath42",
    "+    in this section , we have given the simulation results of the ternary alloy model ab@xmath0c@xmath1 and we have also discussed the dependence of the critical and compensation temperature on the concentration and other interaction parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "simulation results have been obtained for the system with lattice size @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , however , here , we have only presented the results of the model with lattice size @xmath43 .",
    "we also note that the critical temperature of the system for the different interaction rates and concentrations have been obtained by using of the method of the finite - size scaling @xcite .     in the three dimensional ternary alloy ab@xmath0c@xmath1 for different values of @xmath16",
    "when @xmath44.,width=302,height=302 ]    in a recent study @xcite it was reported that two dimensional ternary alloy model does not show a compensation temperature point when there is no next - nearest neighbor interactions term in the hamiltonian i.e. , @xmath45 . however , our simulations show that the system has a compensation point for all @xmath46 ( we set @xmath47 ) values in interval of @xmath48 at @xmath49 when @xmath45 .",
    "this point will be considered below .",
    "now , in order to compare with the previous results @xcite , in figs.2 and 3 we discuss the dependence of the critical temperature of the three dimensional ternary alloy model ab@xmath0c@xmath1 on interaction rate @xmath46 and concentration @xmath16 for next - nearest neighbor interactions i.e. , @xmath45 .     in the three dimensional ternary alloy ab@xmath0c@xmath1 for several values of interaction ratio @xmath46",
    "when @xmath44 .",
    "the lines show a part of the second - order transitions separating the ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic phases.,width=302,height=302 ]    in fig.2 , the critical temperature of the three dimensional ternary alloy model has been plotted as a function of @xmath46 for various values of @xmath16 when @xmath45 .",
    "it can be seen from fig.2 that the critical temperature of the system has a linear dependence on the interaction ratio @xmath46 and there is a critical behavior at a special @xmath46 value . when @xmath50 , the critical temperature of the system has a fixed value of @xmath51 for all @xmath16 values . at @xmath52 ,",
    "the critical temperature of the system does not change with concentration @xmath16 .",
    "this means that neither the spin-1 ions nor spin-5/2 ions substitution to system change the critical temperature of the system at @xmath52 .",
    "this critical behavior has been reported in theoretical and experimental studies @xcite . the value of the @xmath52 for ternary alloy ab@xmath0c@xmath1 whose spins consist of s@xmath53 , s@xmath54 and s@xmath55 has been obtained as @xmath56 in the study based on mean field approximation @xcite and as @xmath57 in the monte carlo simulation of two dimensional system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the experimental measurements indicate that there are prussian blue analogs at the @xmath58 have a @xmath59 which is almost independent of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "fig.2 also reveals that concentration @xmath16 plays an important role for the ternary alloy model ab@xmath0c@xmath1 since it determine the kinds of the spins and interactions in the system .",
    "for example , when @xmath60 and @xmath49 , the system ab@xmath0c@xmath1 fully reduces to the ferromagnetic mixed spin-3/2 and spin-1 and ferrimagnetic mixed spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 ising system , respectively . as seen in fig.2 ,",
    "although @xmath59 of the system is independent of @xmath16 at @xmath52 , however , the total magnetization of the system may considerably change owing to relatively small variation of the concentration @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , for different values of @xmath16 , the dependence of critical temperature of the system on the interaction ratio @xmath46 is very different above and below of @xmath52 .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the change of the concentration @xmath16 in the system . on the other hand",
    ", it can be detected from fig.2 that when @xmath61 , the critical temperature of the mixed spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 system is smaller than mixed spin-3/2 and spin-1 system .",
    "on the contrary , when @xmath62 , the critical temperature of the mixed spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 system has the highest value . on the @xmath59 lines , the critical temperature of the mixed",
    "spin-3/2 and spin-1 ising system is equal to that of the mixed spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 ising one .",
    "c@xmath1 vs temperature for different values of @xmath16 ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]    in fig.3 , the dependence of the critical temperature of the three dimensional ab@xmath0c@xmath1 system on the concentration @xmath16 has been shown for several values of @xmath46 when @xmath45 .",
    "the lines represent part of the second - order phase transition separating the ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic .",
    "fig.3 provides the argument that the concentration @xmath16 determines the magnetic features of the system mentioned above . indeed , fig.3",
    "clearly shows that the critical temperature of the system is changed by the concentration @xmath16 for fixed values of @xmath46 . as seen from this figure that , when @xmath61 , the critical temperature of the system linearly increases with increasing of @xmath16 , whereas , when @xmath62 , the critical temperature of the system linearly decreases with increasing of @xmath16 for fixed values of @xmath46 .",
    "however , when the values of @xmath46 close up @xmath52 , the critical temperature of the system more slowly , but linearly , change with increasing @xmath16 , and at the critical @xmath52 value , the critical temperature of the system denoted by triangle - line in fig.3 is independent of the concentration @xmath16 . on the other hand",
    ", fig.3 also shows that the interaction rate @xmath46 plays an important role on the critical temperature of the three dimensional ab@xmath0c@xmath1 system .",
    "finally we state that the critical temperature of the model are consistent with previous result @xcite .",
    "c@xmath1 vs temperature for different values of @xmath16 ( @xmath63 and @xmath65 ) .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]    in this study we recognize that the three dimensional ternary alloy model ab@xmath0c@xmath1 has one compensation behavior for @xmath45 , however , for @xmath66 it has one or multi compensation points , when other conditions are satisfied .",
    "however , the appearance of the compensation temperature is strongly affected by the interaction and concentration parameters .",
    "indeed we see in the present study that the model has not a compensation point for all values of @xmath16 and @xmath46 .",
    "the dependence of the compensation temperature behavior on concentration and other interaction parameters has been discussed below . for discussion , although the system has been simulated in the intervals of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the value of @xmath69 used in the present study is chosen based on previous theoretical study @xcite .",
    "the results of simulation for @xmath64 and @xmath65 are respectively represented in figs.4 and 5 for chosen parameters .",
    "one compensation point has been found in the intervals of @xmath70 and @xmath71 when @xmath63 .",
    "however , it is seen that the system has not compensation behavior for the same values of parameters when @xmath72 . for @xmath64 and several values of @xmath16 ,",
    "the compensation behavior of the system can be seen from fig.4 . on the other hand ,",
    "as seen from fig.5 , the considered system has a multi compensation behavior at @xmath65 and @xmath73 for @xmath63 while it has one compensation point for @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , our simulation data introduce that the system shows compensation behavior at @xmath49 for all values of @xmath46 , when @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , in the case @xmath45 , the compensation point has been found for @xmath75 at @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; for @xmath78 at @xmath73 ; for @xmath79 at @xmath73 ; for @xmath80 at @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ; for @xmath65 at @xmath81 , @xmath84 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . whereas , it has been reported in previous study that there is no compensation point for @xmath45 in two dimensional model @xcite .     on the interaction parameters in hamiltonian of ternary alloy ab@xmath0c@xmath1 for @xmath85.,width=302,height=302 ]",
    "the effect of the interaction parameters on the compensation behavior of the three dimensional ternary model is also discussed in fig.6 .",

    "similarly for fixed @xmath16 , @xmath63 and @xmath88 , the compensation temperature decreases slowly with increasing of @xmath89 .",
    "however , for fixed @xmath16 , @xmath63 and @xmath87 , the compensation temperature dramatically increases as @xmath91 increases .",
    "these results indicate that the compensation temperature has a strong dependence on the parameter @xmath90 whereas its dependence on @xmath69 and @xmath89 is relatively weak .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the dependence of the compensation temperature on the parameters of present model consistent with the results of two dimensional model @xcite .",
    "in this study , we have considered the three dimensional ternary model ab@xmath0c@xmath1 whose spins consist of s@xmath53 , s@xmath54 and s@xmath55 .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the critical and compensation temperature behavior of the considered model on concentration and interactions by using mc simulation method .",

    "particularly , we have found that the critical temperature of the model is independent on concentration of different types of spins at a critical @xmath52 value and the model has one or two compensation temperature points in a certain range of values of the concentration of the different spins .",
    "we concluded that magnetic properties of the system ab@xmath0c@xmath1 can be controlled by changing the relative concentration of the different species of ions . as a result",
