    "the standard parameter set of the nilsson model has been also quite successful in reproducing single particle spectra of stable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "new parameter sets were proposed to improve the predictability of the model for neutron rich  @xcite and proton rich  @xcite nuclei .",
    "single particle levels of this parameter sets are compared in refs .",
    "@xcite with those obtained by shf and rmf models .",
    "we also note that the origin of the prolate dominance shapes over the oblate ones can be explained in the framework of a nilsson model as an effect of the strong interference between spin - orbit and orbit - orbit terms of the nilsson potential  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , except for the pseudo - spin symmetry study in finite nuclei  @xcite , there have been no other investigations of the role of the orbit - orbit potential ( @xmath5 ) which is directly derived from rmf models .    odd nuclei and single particle spectra in an rmf - fr model using different level of approximations (",
    "spherical and deformed ) were computed and compared in ref .",
    "in ref  @xcite , single particle splitting energies between spin - orbit partners along some isotonic chain ( o , ca , sn ) are also examined in the framework of rmf , shf and relativistic hartree - fock models .",
    "furthermore , there is another method to study spin - orbit potential by exploring high - spin data  @xcite . with this method",
    "one can avoid the scarce and uncertain data available on spin - orbit splittings and their isotopic as well as isotonic dependences .",
    "here we quote from ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , that the most recent experimental data evaluations @xcite give @xmath6 6 mev for @xmath7 and @xmath6 5 mev for @xmath8 , while older works give @xmath6 6.8 mev @xcite , 7.3 mev @xcite , 7.7 mev@xcite for @xmath7 and @xmath6 5.3 mev @xcite for @xmath8 .",
    "more detailed information on single particle levels can be found in ref .",
    "since the method is based on a direct comparison of the excitation energies of terminating states , the corelations beyond mean - field can be strongly suppresed .",
    "nevertheless , this method is still constrained by the limited knowledge on the time - odd component of the nonrelativistic mean - field  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will revisit and study the single particle spectra ( sps ) of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 in the rmf models in order to understand the origin of their predictive powers for spin - orbit splitting and the reason that the relative placements of the states with different orbital angular momenta @xmath3 are not well reproduced  @xcite .",
    "afterward , we will try to find the connection between their sps predictions with their effective masses ( @xmath2 ) through their @xmath4 and @xmath5 potentials in @xmath9 .",
    "spherically symmetric calculations are used due to the robustness of the spectral differences against polarization effects  @xcite .",
    "we choose nl - z , nl - z2 , nl - vt1 ( rmf - fr )  @xcite and pc - f1 ( rmf - pc )  @xcite because they nearly have the same procedure to adjust their coupling constants , hence the prediction bias due to the different fitting procedure can be minimized .",
    "in this section we will study the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 sps predictions of rmf models .",
    "the experimental single particle data are taken from  @xcite . the @xmath9 neutron ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and proton ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) data as well as the @xmath7 neutron ( @xmath15 ) and proton ( @xmath15 ) data are obtained by averaging over the spectroscopic factors  @xcite . to analyze the relative position between two different levels with different angular momenta ( @xmath16 ) we use the following formulas  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average energy of the spin - orbit partner with angular momentum @xmath3 .",

    ". a quite large deviation appears in the splitting of @xmath32 and @xmath33 states ( the positions of both spin - orbit partners are above fermi surface ) .",
    "it seems that all parameters sets are unable to give good predictions in the neutron spin - orbit splitting .",

    "in addition , we note that rmf - fr ( nl - z , nl - z2 and nl - vt1 ) has a better prediction than rmf - pc ( pc - f1 ) and the presence of the tensor terms ( nl - vt1 ) enhances the improvements in placing and ordering of single particle states , particularly in lighter nuclei ( e.g. , @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , these improvements are still not adequate to overcome the problem .",
    "it has been known that all models presented here have @xmath46 . unlike the non - self - consistent calculations ( models using wood - saxon or nilsson potentials ) , where the sps has a direct connection with the potential parameters , the connection is not so obvious in the rmf models because it is hidden by the self consistency condition .",

    "the tensor term gives only a minor additional contribution in spin - orbit potential near the fermi surface .",

    "the study of non - relativistic potentials of rmf models has been done in many places with different intentions and different methods to obtain @xmath48 and @xmath4  @xcite .    however , a non - relativistic form of the rmf model like the nilsson one has not yet been explored , especially in analyzing the sps .",

    ", nilsson model has different @xmath1 for proton and neutron ( see fig .",

    "rmf ones have larger @xmath0 but smaller @xmath1 .",
    "the differences among all parameter sets ( models ) in @xmath0 only appear in the region close to the center of nuclei .",
    "it means that @xmath0 and @xmath1 of rmf models can be considered as model ( parameter set ) independent . unlike in the nilsson model , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent from the position ( @xmath88 ) , in rmf models both quantities depend on @xmath88 .",
    "the spatial dependence of @xmath87 originates mainly from the energy - dependent potential @xmath48 .",
    "it should be noted that the non - relativistic model , like shf , does not have such dependence .",

    "the fitted parameter sets ( see top left panel of fig .",
    "[ poteffm * ] ) , the depth and the trend around fermi surface do not significantly change when @xmath47 is varied .",
    "it means that the nuclear observable requires a cancellation between scalar and vector potentials .",
    "the scalar and vector potentials tend to weaken if @xmath47 becomes larger than 0.6 , but the @xmath87 is sensitive to the variation of @xmath47 ( see the lower panels of fig",
    ".  [ poteffm * ] ) .",
    "@xmath87 decreases when @xmath2/m increases .",
    "the weakening of @xmath87 is due to the smallness of the spin - orbit splitting ( see the upper - left panel of fig .  [ pb208spsm * ] ) .",
    "fitting the parameters to the nuclear observable does not help in this case .",
    "therefore , only appropriate values of scalar and vector potentials can yield a correct @xmath86 and @xmath87 simultaneously .",
    "these potentials correspond to an @xmath47 of about 0.6 .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ kamum * ] , the nilsson parameter @xmath0 depends on @xmath47 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 at fermi surface decreases when @xmath47 increases and the major effects are found for the fitted parameter sets . for these parameter sets , if @xmath2 = 0.77 @xmath92 , it coincides with the prediction from the nilsson model ( shaded area ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1 from fitted parameter sets is almost independent from the @xmath47 variation , while @xmath1 of the unfitted parameter sets , on the contrary , depends on @xmath47 .",
    "it means that for the rmf models , a constant value of @xmath1 is the requirement for the correct nuclear bulk properties . the value of @xmath1 of the rmf models around fermi surface is smaller than that of the nilsson model . in the rmf models , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "depend on each other .",
    "as @xmath47 is getting larger , @xmath0 is getting smaller and the spin - orbit potential is getting smaller in order to keep @xmath1 constant .",
    "the variation of the neutron and proton sps with respect to the variation of @xmath2/m is shown in fig .",
    "[ pb208spsm * ] .",
    "some states are shifted up and some other are shifted down as @xmath47 increases .",
    "this combination does not improve the sps relative position .",
    "the reason is mainly due to the spin - orbit splitting which is getting narrower when @xmath47 increases . in the relative position between two different spin - orbit partners ( @xmath16 ) a couple of states",
    "are closer to experimental data but the majority of states deviate more when @xmath47 increases .",
    "the value of @xmath93 is negative for p-070 because there is an exchange of ordering in @xmath32 states ( the value of the gap is negative ) . except for @xmath93 , all @xmath16s change quite drastically .",
    "this effect depends on @xmath47 , but the pattern of changing is not the same for every level .",
    "it seems that the relative position ( @xmath16 ) can be reproduced if @xmath47 depends on the states .",
    "this dependence can be generated only if we take into account the exchange and/or other correlations ( effects ) beyond mean - fields .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether or not the exchange effect can remedy this problem .",
    "future calculation should address this question .",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 sps of rmf models have been revisited and studied .",
    "qualitatively , all rmf models presented here have a similar trend in sps .",
    "quantitatively , however , they still have differences due to the models . from the comparison with new experimental data  @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the position of the state is not only poorly reproduced , but some level positions in neutron spectra are reversed .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of the rmf model has been derived in which the potentials resemble a wood - saxon and nilsson forms .",
    "the energy - dependent potentials @xmath48 and @xmath72 ( in wood - saxon type ) of rmf models can be transformed into energy - independent potentials @xmath86 and @xmath94 ( in nilsson type ) but with an additional angular momentum - dependent potential @xmath95 .",
    "these potentials are used to analyze the @xmath9 sps predictions from several rmf models .",
    "we found that , first , the behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 of rmf models is different from that of the nilsson model .",
    "second , due to the inter - dependence of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 in rmf models , the acceptable parameter sets ( @xmath46 ) at the fermi surface need a relatively large @xmath96 in order to maintain a correct spin - orbit splitting .",
    "since the effect of tensor terms in the rmf model is too small in @xmath72 of heavy nuclei ( @xmath9 ) , the effect is marginal to give correct level spacings and placement ordering .",
    "the suspicion that a relatively small @xmath96 ( large @xmath47 ) yields a relatively better placement of states is found to be wrong .",
    "it is shown in the @xmath9 case that when @xmath96 is decreasing only two placements of the states are getting better , whereas the rest are getting worse .",
    "therefore , it seems that the problem of rmf models in reproducing experimental data on the relative placement of the states is originated in the independence of @xmath2 from @xmath3 ( state ) .",
