    "observations at millimeter ( mm ) and sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) wavelengths have provided convincing evidence of rapid dust enrichment at high redshift ( for a recent review see carilli & walter 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "dust masses as large as @xmath4 have been inferred for @xmath5 qso host galaxies , requiring a very efficient dust formation channel that must operate in less than 1 gyr of cosmic evolution .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that although stellar sources of dust , including both supernovae ( sn ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , can be fast enough to significantly contribute to high redshift dust enrichment ( valiante et al .",
    "2009 ) , the observed dust masses require efficient grain growth in the dense phase of the interstellar medium ( ism , michalowski et al . 2010 ; valiante et al . 2011 ; 2014 ) . until very recently , sub - mm / mm continuum observations at @xmath6 have been limited to `` extreme '' galaxies , qso hosts or strong starbursts , which are characterized by star formation rates ranging from several hundreds to thousands of solar masses per year",
    "however , at these high redshifts we expect the bulk of the galaxy population to be characterized by `` normal '' galaxies , which form stars at rates from a few to a few tens of solar masses per year .",
    "deep alma and plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) follow up observations have mostly provided upper limits on the dust mass of such galaxies ( kanekar et al . 2013 ; ouchi et al .",

    "a similar semi - numerical approach has been followed by dayal , hirashita & ferrara ( 2010 ) , who considered the contribution to dust enrichment of sn and estimate the far infrared ( fir ) detectability of high - redshift galaxies classified as lyman-@xmath10 emitters ( lae ) .",

    "finally , the last two terms in the right - hand side of eq .  [ eq : dustevo ] represent the effects of dust destruction by interstellar shock waves and grain growth in the dense phase of the ism . here",
    "we assume that at any given time , a fixed fraction @xmath97 of ism is in the cold phase , averaged over simulated galaxies with different masses , ranges between 0.38 and 0.56 ( vallini , dayal & ferrara 2012 ) . ] .",
    "the timescale for grain destruction , @xmath84 , and grain growth , @xmath85 , are computed as in de bennassuti et al .",

    "smaller grain sizes increase the grain surface area per unit dust mass , thus shortening the accretion timescale ( kuo & hirashita 2012 ) . since the simulation has not the resolution to trace the temperature and density of the ism , the values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 which best describe the galaxies under investigation are unconstrained . for this reason , in what follows we explore the impact of different values of @xmath108 on the resulting dust masses .",
    "figure [ fig : dustmass ] shows a comparison between the predicted dust masses of the simulated galaxies and the observations .",
    "we show the dust mass as a function of the stellar mass for all the simulated galaxies with intrinsic @xmath71 at @xmath109 and @xmath110 . for each galaxy ,",
    "the light grey point represents the mass of dust that is produced by stellar sources ( agb stars and sne ) after grain destruction and astration ( eq .  [ eq : dustevo ] without grain growth ) , and the blue point is the total dust mass , including the effect of grain growth in the ism .",
    "here we have assumed a grain growth timescale @xmath111 . due to the lower metallicities ,",
    "grain growth is not efficient at stellar masses @xmath112 . in these small galaxies ,",
    "we predict that all the existing dust mass is entirely contributed by stellar sources .",
    "galaxies with larger stellar masses have experienced a larger degree of chemical enrichment and the gas metallicities are high enough to activate efficient grain growth , although with a large scatter . yet , due to the time required to enrich the ism with metals , the bulk of the dust mass in the most massive galaxies is grown between @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in fact , while at @xmath68 all the simulated galaxies have @xmath113 , at @xmath69 there are several galaxies with dust masses @xmath114 .",
    "note that the observational data points , that we have reported in both panels for the sake of comparison , refer to galaxies which span a redshift range @xmath115 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these results depend on the adopted stellar dust yield and grain growth timescale . in the lower panel of figure [ fig : dustmass ]",
    "we show the effect of reducing the efficiency of grain destruction by the sn reverse shock : if all the grains survive the passage of the reverse shock , the effective sn dust yields is @xmath116 times larger and the resulting dust masses contributed by stellar sources increase by a comparable factor .",
    "these sn yields bracket the observations of dust masses in sn and sn remnants obtained with the _ herschel _ satellite ( see fig .  6 in schneider",
    "et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the figure shows that although the total dust mass is larger , even with maximally efficient sn dust enrichment the predicted dust masses at @xmath68 are @xmath117 , too small to account for the observed dust mass in a1689-zd1 .",
    "we conclude that in order to account for the existing dust mass in this galaxy , a shorter grain growth timescale is required .",
    "it is interesting to analyse the relative contribution of agb stars , sn and grain growth as a function of redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : dustevo ] shows the redshift evolution of the dust mass for galaxies with @xmath118 .",
    "we separate the contribution from agb stars , stellar sources , and the total mass of dust , including grain growth with an accretion timescale @xmath77 ( upper panel ) and 0.2 myr ( lower panel ) .",
    "as expected from figure  [ fig : dustmass ] , grain growth provides the dominant contribution , exceeding the dust produced by stellar sources already at @xmath119 . among the stellar sources ,",
    "sn appear always dominant , but the average contribution of agb stars can be as large as @xmath120 .",
    "this confirms that the contribution of agb stars to high redshift dust formation can not be neglected , especially for the galaxies currently targeted by observational searches ( valiante et al .",
    "finally , in the lower panel we show that the dust mass detected in a1689-zd1 requires very efficient grain growth , with a timescale @xmath121 , one order of magnitude shorter than required to reproduce the observed dust - to - gas ratio in the milky way and in most local dwarf galaxies ( de bennassuti et al .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the cold atomic and molecular phases of the ism , where grain growth is more efficient , must have an average density of @xmath122 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : acc ] ) .",
    "such a value is comparable to the molecular gas density inferred from co excitation analyses of starburst galaxies at comparable ( although slightly smaller ) redshifts ( see carilli & walter 2013 ) .",
    "morever , the molecular phase in these high - redshift star - forming galaxies may also be warmer , leading to somewhat lower @xmath123 .",
    "although plausible , our study suggests that these conditions must be exceptional , as if they were to apply to all galaxies a @xmath124 , current upper limits on the dust continuum emission for normal star forming galaxies at @xmath3 would be exceeded .",
    "in this work we have investigated dust enrichment of the ism of `` normal '' galaxies , which form stars at rates between a few to a few tens of solar masses per year , at @xmath9 . we find that dusty galaxies are already formed at these high redshifts , due to rapid enrichment by sn and agb stars .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the dust mass in the most massive galaxies , with @xmath125 , which are the galaxies detected in the uv with present facilities , comes from grain growth .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends on the metallicity , density and temperature of the cold and dense phase of the ism . while the upper limits on the dust continuum emission can be matched with an accretion timescale of @xmath126 , comparable to the value adopted by de bennassuti et al .",
    "( 2014 ) to reproduce the dust - to - gas ratio of the milky way and local dwarfs , the observed dust mass of a1689-zd1 at @xmath2 can only be reproduced if more extreme conditions are adopted , with @xmath121 , similar to the value assumed for qso host galaxies ( valiante et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that physical conditions in the ism can lead to different values of @xmath127 even for galaxies with comparable metallicity : two of the most metal - poor local dwarfs , sbs 0335 - 052 and izw18 , have a metallicity of @xmath128 but widely different dust masses ( hunt et al .",
    "the proposed interpretation is that the greater dust mass in sbs 0335 - 052 is due to the more efficient grain growth allowed by the high density ism , observationally inferred to be almost 20 times higher than in izw18 ( schneider , hunt & valiante 2015 ) .",
    "we conclude that , when the ism is characterized by large enough densities , dust masses in high redshift galaxies may be more common than hitherto believed and that the level of dust enrichment may not always be satisfactorily assessed from the gas metallicity .",
