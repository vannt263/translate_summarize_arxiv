    "the concept of _ damage spreading _ was introduced in the context of biologically motivated dynamical systems by stuart kauffman@xcite .",
    "the question posed is whether the phase - space trajectories of two slightly different copies of a dynamic system , subjected to the same thermal noise , will stay close ( or even merge ) at long times or , alternatively , will they diverge ?",
    "damage spreading made its first appearance in the physics literature in the mid eighties  @xcite , and attracted considerable interest and attention .",
    "the main reason behind this initial enthusiasm was the hope that damage may spread ( indicating chaotic behavior ) in some regions of a system s parameter space and disappear or _",
    "heal _ elsewhere .",
    "this possibility intrigued researchers , since if indeed realized , it would have indicated the existence of different _ dynamic phases _ in various complex systems ( such as spin - glasses ) @xcite . the initial enthusiasm concerning damage spreading has abated during subsequent years ;",
    "the main reason being an apparent lack of an _ objective , observer - independent measure _ of whether damage does or does not spread in a given system .",
    "even for relatively simple models , such as the two dimensional ferromagnetic ising model , different results were obtained when heat bath or metropolis dynamics were used@xcite .",
    "both these dynamic procedures are phenomenological ( since they satisfy detailed balance , they can be used to generate equilibrium ensembles ) and the two are equally legitimate to mimic the temporal evolution of a system in contact with a thermal reservoir . if spreading or healing of damage were to indicate some intrinsic property of the system , one would not expect the result to depend on the details of exactly which phenomenological procedure was used to generate its dynamics .",
    "the purpose of this communication is to pose the `` right '' question ; i.e. one which has a well defined objective answer .",
    "the essence of the argument is to consider the entire family of dynamic procedures that are consistent with the physically dictated constraints of the problem . for any particular system one of",
    "_ three _ possibilities may hold :    1 .",
    "damage is spreading for every member of the family of dynamic procedures 2 .",
    "damage heals for every member of this family 3 .",
    "damage spreads for a subset of the possible dynamic procedures , and heals for the complementing subset .",
    "hence the only question regarding damage spreading that has an unambiguous , observer - independent answer is : to which of these three classes a particular system belongs ?    to demonstrate the general concept introduced here we studied the simplest dynamic model in which damage spreading has been observed , the one - dimensional domany - kinzel ( dk ) cellular automaton @xcite , for which we found the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the dk automaton is a two - parameter model whose temporal evolution contains , as special cases , the bond and site directed percolation problems .",
    "the main point made by dk was _ universality : _",
    "namely , that the entire family of observed transitions of the one - dimensional cellular automaton is in the directed percolation universality class .",
    "dk identified two phases ; a `` dry '' or `` frozen '' phase , in which all initial conditions evolve to the absorbing state , and an `` active '' or percolating phase .",
    "some years later martins et al @xcite discovered that in a certain region of the active phase damage spreads , and it heals elsewhere .",
    "more detailed investigations , using simulations @xcite - @xcite as well as analytic ( mean field ) approximations @xcite , @xcite - @xcite confirmed the existence of this `` chaotic phase '' .",
    "its boundary , however , was shown @xcite to depend on the manner in which the dynamic procedure of the underlying dk model is carried out , while the evolution of a single replica is completely insensitive to the dynamic procedure .",
    "this prompted grassberger @xcite to observe that `` it is misleading to speak of different phases in the dk automaton ... instead these are different phases for very specific algorithms for simulating _",
    "pairs _ of such automata '' .",
    "this observation is the precise analog of the problematic nature of viewing ds as a manifestation of a dynamic transition in spin models , where , as mentioned above , it was well known that different dynamics that yield identical equilibrium properties can give rise to different results for damage spreading .",
    "thus , again , ds becomes a `` subjective '' concept , which is devoid of well defined meaning for the dk model , whose phases should be determined by the properties of a _ single _ evolving system .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to point out that if one defines the most general family of dynamic rules that are consistent with the physics of the problem being studied ( sec ii ) , ds has an objective , observer - independent meaning .",
    "past work on ds in the dk model is reviewed in sec iii and in sec iv the existence of the three well defined distinct phases described in the introduction is established for the dk model by numerical simulations and analytical arguments .",
    "we also tested and confirmed a recent conjecture of grassberger , to the effect that the damage spreading transition is in the directed percolation universality class @xcite . analytical support for this conjecture came so far from approximate mean - field arguments @xcite and an exact statement first made by kohring and schreckenberg @xcite , who noted that on the @xmath0 line the dynamics of damage spreading in the dk automaton is precisely identical to the evolution of the dk automaton itself , and hence on this line ds is trivially in the dp universality class .",
    "this being a rather special line , it is of interest to try to establish such precise mapping of ds to dp also elsewhere in the @xmath1 plane . in sec",
    "iv a we present such an extension .",
    "we turn now to present our arguments for the possibility of defining an observer - independent measurement of damage spreading . by this",
    "we do not mean that ds is reflected in the dynamic behavior of a single system , so that grassberger s observation still holds ; ds is a property of a _ pair _ of automata .",
    "it is possible , however , to address the lack of objectivity implicit in one s freedom to choose the precise algorithm that is used for the evolution of the pair of replicas .",
    "if every observer can pick his favorite dynamic rule , get results ( on ds ) that depend on the rule used , while no measurement done on an evolving single system can differentiate between the rules - indeed it appears contradictory to claim that ds reflects `` phases '' of the model that is being investigated .",
    "nevertheless such phases can be defined in a precise way .    to overcome this apparent paradox we formulate quite general and physically motivated restrictions on the possible dynamic rules that one can use for studying ds . by `` physical '' we mean that the restrictions are dictated by the dynamics of the single evolving system .",
    "the restrictions are as follows :    1 .",
    "the dynamic rules for the evolution of the pair of replicas are such that the evolution of a single replica is according to its `` natural '' dynamics . 2 .   the transition probability matrix for a site @xmath2 for the pair of replicas can depend only on those sites that affect the evolution of site @xmath2 under the dynamic rules of a single system .",
    "3 .   the rules that govern evolution for the pair do not break any of the symmetries of the single - replica dynamics .",
    "the first restriction simply means that the fact that we are watching two systems evolving in parallel should not affect the behavior of any one of them .",
    "the second constraint means that if the evolution of site @xmath2 is affected , say , only by the states of its nearest neighbors , the relative states taken on site @xmath2 by the two replicas should not feel longer range interactions .",
    "for example , if site @xmath2 and all its neighbors @xmath3 are in the same state in the two replicas , we do not expect damage to be generated at @xmath2 by a damaged site which is far away ( i.e. not one of the neighbors of @xmath2 ) . the third rule implies , for example , that if there is a left - right symmetry in the evolution of a single system the same must hold for the pair of replicas .    clearly",
    ", the subjectivity in defining the damage spreading procedure that was described above has now been shifted to this point - to selecting the restrictions that define which ds procedure is `` legitimate '' .",
    "we do believe that there is much less arbitrariness , however , in this kind of subjectivity than what was done before - choosing , at random , one out of a continuum of physically equivalent procedures .",
    "[ formalism ]      we now introduce a general formalism for damage spreading problems in one - dimensional models with parallel updates .",
    "consider a one - dimensional spin chain with @xmath4 sites and certain boundary conditions to be specified .",
    "at each site @xmath5 a local spin variable @xmath6 is placed which can be in @xmath7 different states .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the probability to find the system at time @xmath9 in the state @xmath10 which is positive and normalized by @xmath11 the time evolution of a system with parallel updates is discrete and can be described by a transfer matrix @xmath12 , whose element @xmath13 is the probability of making a transition from state @xmath10 at time @xmath9 to state @xmath14 at time @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding discrete time master equation has the form @xmath16 the conservation of probability ( [ normalization ] ) implies that @xmath17 for all configurations @xmath10 , which means that the elements in each column of the transfer matrix add up to one .    in what follows",
    "we assume that each site is updated simultaneously@xmath18 and that an update at some site @xmath3 depends locally on @xmath19 sites of the previous configuration , say @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the transfer matrix factorizes : @xmath22 each factor @xmath23 conserves probability separately : @xmath24 we now consider two replicas @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the same system .",
    "denote by @xmath10 and @xmath14 the states of @xmath25 and by @xmath27 and @xmath28 those of @xmath26 . in order to define simultaneous temporal evolution of these systems",
    ", one has to generalize the transfer matrix : @xmath29 the transfer matrix for the total system @xmath30 is restricted by the requirement that each replica should evolve as before , i.e. integrating out the degrees of freedom of one of the replicas results in the previous transfer matrix of the other replica : @xmath31 these restrictions already imply probability conservation for the total system : @xmath32 in order to study damage spreading , a further restriction is imposed : once both replicas reach the same state ( no damage ) , their temporal evolution is identical : @xmath33 we define damage as the hamming distance between the states @xmath10 and @xmath27 at any given time , that is the fraction of sites for which @xmath34 : @xmath35 the restrictions ( [ restrictionone ] ) , ( [ restrictiontwo ] ) , and ( [ restrictionthree ] ) impose dependences among the @xmath36 matrix elements @xmath37 .",
    "the number of independent degrees of freedom can be counted as follows .",
    "first notice that because of eq .",
    "( [ automatic ] ) only @xmath38 of the @xmath39 equations in ( [ restrictionone ] ) and ( [ restrictiontwo ] ) are independent .",
    "thus , even though for any given initial configuration @xmath40 the number of different final configurations is @xmath41 , the number of independent matrix elements is @xmath42 . on the other hand eq .",
    "( [ restrictionthree ] ) implies that for @xmath43 of @xmath44 possible initial configurations @xmath40 the matrix elements are already defined .",
    "furthermore the whole system is symmetric under exchange of the replicas which gives another factor @xmath45 .",
    "thus the total number of independent degrees of freedom of the transfer matrix is @xmath46      in a numerical simulation the temporal evolution described by the transfer matrix @xmath12 can be realized as follows . at each time step",
    "all sites are updated independently , i.e. @xmath47 is replaced by a new value @xmath48 according to probabilistic rules which depend only on the previous configuration @xmath49 . since in this paper",
    "we discuss only two - state models , let us from now on restrict our attention to the case @xmath50 , with @xmath51 ( the generalization to @xmath52 is straightforward ) .",
    "we introduce a stochastic binary variable @xmath53 , that denotes the value assigned to site @xmath3 in one update , given the state of its neighborhood @xmath49 : @xmath54 the numbers @xmath53 are generated probabilistically in some procedure , such that updates at different sites or different times are uncorrelated .",
    "furthermore , their expectation value , averaged over many realizations of random numbers , is given by the corresponding matrix element of the transfer matrix : @xmath55 usually this procedure is implemented by generating a random number @xmath56 from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath57 , and comparing it with the transition probability @xmath58 , to get the assigned value of @xmath53 : @xmath59 this prescription is not unique , however , and there are many other possibilities to select @xmath53 in a manner that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ onepointfunction ] ) .",
    "this constraint specifies the temporal evolution of a _ single _ system .",
    "the existence of correlations between any two random variables @xmath53 and @xmath60 will play no role in the evolution of a single system , since only one of the two will be used for any given update .",
    "the situation is different , however , in damage spreading problems in which the two different replicas of the system are evolving simultaneously .",
    "the updated state of the pair of replicas is governed by the _",
    "joint _ transition probabilities @xmath61 therefore correlations between the two random variables @xmath62 will influence the temporal evolution of the combined system and , therewith , the properties of damage spreading . such correlations are contained in the two - point correlation functions of the random variables , which are given by the elements of the combined transfer matrix for both replicas : @xmath63 in this formalism the restriction ( [ restrictionone])-([restrictiontwo ] ) , stating that each replica separately evolves in the same way as the original system , is satisfied automatically .",
    "the same applies to the second restriction ( [ restrictionthree ] ) which ensures that in case of ` no damage ' both systems evolve in parallel .    obviously , the number of degrees of freedom specifying damage spreading is just the number of two - point correlation functions . in the case of two - state models",
    "there are @xmath64 such correlations , which agrees with the number of degrees of freedom counted in eq .",
    "( [ degreesfreedom ] ) .",
    "three - point correlations do not affect the evolution of a pair of replicas , because in each update only two random variables , @xmath53 and @xmath60 , are used .",
    "however , they would start to play a role in damage spreading problems with three replicas .",
    "generally , @xmath65-point correlations will be felt in systems consisting of at least @xmath65 replicas .",
    "in this section we review briefly past work on damage spreading in the dk automaton .",
    "we emphasize the manner in which ds was calculated by various authors , and the manner in which different ways of defining ds are embedded in the general formal framework of sec ii .",
    "the dk automaton is defined as follows : a binary variable @xmath66 characterizes the state of site @xmath2 at ( discrete ) time @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath67 means that the site is wet or active , whereas @xmath68 means that it is dry .",
    "the automaton evolves by a parallel update rule , which can be stated , using the notation of sec ii , as follows : @xmath69 @xmath70 that is , the state of site @xmath2 at time @xmath15 depends only on the states of its two neighbors at time @xmath9 ; only wet sites can give rise to a wet site , with probabilities @xmath71 if one neighbor was wet and @xmath72 if both were wet .",
    "using the notations introduced in sec ii the transition probabilities in the dk model are defined by the one - point expectation values of _ three _ stochastic binary variables  @xcite @xmath73 this model has a dry phase and a wet phase , separated by a transition line which has been determined with high accuracy by various numerical methods . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the model has not been solved exactly , except for the special line @xmath74 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . at all points on the phase boundary , except the special line ,",
    "the transition to the active or wet phase is characterized by directed percolation ( dp ) exponents .",
    "damage spreading properties between two replicas are controlled by correlations between the random variables : @xmath75 according to the arguments discussed in sec ii , only one- and two - point functions enter the transfer matrix , which means that @xmath76 is an irrelevant parameter in the present problem .",
    "martins et al @xcite were the first to address the issue of damage spreading in the dk model .",
    "two nearly identical initial configurations were allowed to evolve on two replicas , using the same random numbers for both ( the precise meaning of this statement will be explained below ) .",
    "they discovered that the active phase contains in fact two regions ; one in which damage spreads and its complement , where it does not .",
    "the boundary between these regions was subsequently determined with increasing accuracy by zebende and penna @xcite , by martins et al @xcite , rieger et al @xcite and grassberger @xcite . independently ,",
    "mean - field type approximations of varying complexity were also used to study the ds problem @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation , first made by kohring and schreckenberg @xcite , was to the effect that the position of the `` phase boundary '' between the ds and non - spreading regimes depends on the manner in which damage is generated .",
    "the original scheme of martins et al used a single uniformly distributed random number @xmath77 for the two replicas : using the definitions of sec ii this means that the choice @xmath78 was made , which can be expressed as @xmath79 the dynamical process is generated by setting @xmath80 for reasons that will be evident shortly , we call this dynamic process , that uses a single random number , _ maximally correlated_.    kohring and schreckenberg recognized the fact that one could , in principle , use two different random numbers to determine @xmath81 and @xmath82 , if at least one of the two neighbor sites was damaged at time @xmath9 .",
    "in fact they studied ds using two different random numbers @xmath83 and @xmath84 , their ds procedure has two _ fully correlated _ binary variables ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) and two _ uncorrelated _ ones ( @xmath85 and @xmath87 ) : @xmath88 the correlations being @xmath89 the dynamics generated by using on the first replica @xmath90 and @xmath91 on the second gave rise to a shift of the original `` phase boundary '' ( as obtained with a single random number , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1rand ] ) ) .",
    "as discussed in sec ii , the evolution of a single replica is completely insensitive to whether one or two random variables are used in the dynamic procedure , which prompted grassberger @xcite to make his observation quoted in the introduction .",
    "finally we note that grassberger has formulated recently @xcite a conjecture , which is a natural extension of previous statements @xcite regarding universality of directed percolation transitions for models with non - symmetric absorbing states @xcite . according to this conjecture damage - spreading transitions",
    "should be in the universality class of directed percolation@xcite , provided some general conditions are satisfied .",
    "the dk model is a natural candidate to test this conjecture because of its simplicity , ease to simulate and our precise knowledge of the existence of a ds transition and its location .",
    "grassberger presented numerical evidence for his conjecture , which we also confirmed and extended .",
    "we also show below that in a region of the @xmath92 plane one can map ds exactly to the dk model and hence onto dp .",
    "this result is an extension of a statement first made by kohring and schreckenberg @xcite , who noted that such a mapping holds on the @xmath0 line .",
    "as discussed in sec iii , the most general dynamic rule that can be defined for two replicas of the dk automaton , in accordance with these constraints , has two degrees of freedom or parameters , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "as it turns out ( see appendix  [ appendixrestrictions ] ) , the possible values that @xmath95 and @xmath94 can take are restricted by requiring that all transition rates in the transfer matrix have to be positive . for any value of @xmath92 , the range of allowed values of the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath94 is given by @xmath96 there are three important special cases , namely those of    * maximal correlations :   @xmath97 * no correlations :  @xmath98 * minimal correlations :     in the case of minimal correlations , the values listed above hold only in the region @xmath99 ( see appendix  [ appendixrestrictions ] ) .",
    "we turn now to show that for @xmath100 the damage spreading process can be mapped exactly onto a directed percolation process .",
    "kohring and schreckenberg @xcite have shown that such a mapping holds on the _ line _ @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , their choice of parameters ( [ eq : kscorr ] ) is a particular case of our damage spreading procedure , which is the most general one that satisfies rules 1 - 3 listed above .",
    "therefore we find a wider ( _ two - dimensional _ ) region in the @xmath92 plane in which such a mapping is possible .",
    "to see this , let @xmath102 be the damage at site @xmath2 .",
    "by @xmath103 we denote the probability to generate a damaged site for a given initial configuration in a particular update .",
    "these probabilities are listed in table i , in which we introduced for brevity the notation @xmath104 in general , the probability for generating damage on site @xmath2 depends on the previous states of both replicas , i.e. on @xmath105 ; knowledge of @xmath106 and @xmath107 does not suffice to determine @xmath108 at the next time step . thus damage spreading itself can not be seen as an independent process .",
    "we may , however , pose the following question : under which conditions will damage spread as if it were generated by an independent process ? that is , when do we have @xmath109 in order to satisfy this condition , any two entries in table i , that correspond to the same initial damage @xmath110 , should be equal . for example",
    "all four initial configurations @xmath111 have the same initial damage @xmath112 . in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ independentprocess ] ) , the four entries @xmath113 must have the same value , i.e. we must have @xmath114 . a similar consideration leads to the condition @xmath115 ; that is , we must have @xmath116 note that these are precisely the update rules of the dk process . using the definitions  ( [ eq : xy ] )",
    ", we see that the correlations must satisfy @xmath117 since the correlation parameters are restricted by eq .",
    "( [ parameterrange ] ) , the allowed range for @xmath71 and @xmath72 in which these conditions can hold is a triangle in the phase diagram : @xmath118 to summarize : we have proved that within this triangle we can find correlations @xmath119 such that the damage spreading process follows the dynamical rules of a single dk automaton .",
    "[ tablegeneratedamage ]       .probabilities @xmath103 for the generation of damage in the dk model . @xmath120 and @xmath121 are defined in eq .",
    "( 26 ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     say we have a line in the @xmath122 plane that lies within this region .",
    "for every point @xmath123 on this line we can find @xmath119 values for which ds evolves precisely like a dk automaton with parameters @xmath123 . since part of the transition line of the dk model ( from dry to wet phase ) lies in the triangle  ( [ eq : triangle ] ) , on any trajectory that crosses this part of the phase boundary we will observe a damage spreading transition precisely at the dp transition and with dp exponents ( provided we chose @xmath119 according to eq .",

    "( [ eq : kscorr ] ) precisely satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : albe ] ) .",
    "other useful results can be obtained by comparing probability tables of different pairs of automata .",
    "the basic idea is that by increasing ( decreasing ) _ all _ probabilities in table i , damage spreading will be more ( less ) likely . more precisely ,",
    "if a pair of dk automata described by parameters @xmath124 exhibits damage spreading , we expect that any other pair of automata with parameters @xmath125 satisfying @xmath126 exhibits damage spreading as well . vice versa , if damage heals in a pair of automata described by @xmath124 , then for any other pair with @xmath125 obeying @xmath127 we expect damage to heal .    although these statements are very plausible , we were not able to prove them rigorously . however , we performed various numerical tests which turned out to be consistent with the inequalities stated above .    because of these inequalities the boundaries between the three regions in the phase diagram correspond to extremal correlations @xmath95 and @xmath94 .",
    "for example , if at a point @xmath122 damage spreads in a model with maximal correlations @xmath128 and @xmath129 , then eq . ( [ moredamage ] ) implies that damage spreads also for every @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the allowed range ( [ parameterrange ] ) .",
    "this , however , means that the point @xmath122 belongs to region 1 in the phase diagram .",
    "therefore the phase boundary of region 1 coincides with the ds transition line for maximal correlations .",

    "it turns out ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) that this line lies entirely in the region @xmath99 so that minimal correlations are well defined ( see appendix  [ appendixmaxmin ] ) .",
    "alternatively one can compare the probabilities for generating damage in a pair of dk automata to the probabilities of generating a wet site in a single dk automaton .",
    "to this end one simply has to use the same inequalities setting @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "for example , if @xmath134 and @xmath135 represent a point in the wet phase of the dk phase diagram , then for all pairs of automata parametrized by @xmath136 and satisfying @xmath137 damage will spread . on the other hand ,",

    "grassberger overcame the difficulty posed by long transients and obtained good statistics by simulating @xmath19 replicas of the same system in parallel , using simple bit manipulations on computers with unsigned words of length @xmath19  @xcite . using this multi - spin encoding method he measured the decay in damage on a one - million site chain , allowing it to evolve for hundreds of thousands of time steps . because of the improved statistics he was able to determine the critical exponents for damage spreading at a particular transition point with high accuracy .    another method to determine the critical point efficiently",
    "is the so - called gradient method which was introduced by zebende and penna  @xcite . in this method a gradient in @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "is arranged along the chain .",
    "the values of the parameters at the two end - points of the chain are chosen to be in different phases , i.e. on different sides of the transition point .",
    "this allows the critical point to be determined by measuring the average location of the boundary of the active ( damaged ) cluster .    in the present work we used a combination of multi - spin encoding and the gradient method",
    "in combining these methods , a number of problems emerged which we solved as follows :    1 .   in order to measure the damage spreading transition point ,",
    "one has to find the first position ( approaching from the non - spreading phase ) where damage occurs .",
    "simulating @xmath169 lattices in parallel , this has to be done for each of the @xmath170 pairs of replicas . to do",
    "this one has to set up a @xmath171 table in order to keep track of damaged pairs .",
    "moreover , one has to scan the words bit by bit which makes it impossible to use parallel bit manipulations .",
    "the large amount of cpu time needed for this process usually kills the advantage one gains from the multi - spin encoding . in order to solve this problem",
    ", we used a simplified search algorithm which is based on fast bit operations .",
    "the price we pay is that only @xmath172 of all possible pairs are taken into account if the majority of the other replicas is in a different state . instead of keeping track of damaged _ pairs of replicas _ , we recognize only _ single replicas _ from where damage originated .",
    "this amounts in dropping statistically 25% of all possible pairs . ] .",
    "we proved that the error of this method does not bias the measurement of the transition point .",
    "2 .   zebende and penna started each run with a single damaged seed located somewhere on the chain .",
    "it is not clear whether the choice of the location influences the results . in order to circumvent this problem , we used initial conditions with randomly distributed damage all over the chain .",
    "3 .   the gradient method is a finite - size simulation and therefore boundary conditions may play an important role . in the work of zebende and",
    "penna the boundary conditions can be understood as dry walls and it is not clear to what extent they affect the measurements . in order to minimize this effect , we created , on a chain of @xmath173 sites , a gradient with reflection symmetry ( @xmath174 and @xmath174 ) and measured the boundary of the damaged cluster on both sides .",
    "we expect finite - size effects to be less important for these periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the phase diagram of the dk automaton , obtained using the _ multiple lattice gradient method _ ,",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "first , we verified numerically the prediction that larger correlations correspond to smaller damage and vice versa .",
    "this was done by scanning the @xmath175 space for various points in the @xmath122 plane .",
    "next we determined the ds transition lines for minimal and maximal correlations .",
    "typical gradient values of @xmath176 were used for lattice sizes @xmath177 and upwards .",
    "a transient period of at least @xmath178 was followed by an averaging period of @xmath4 time steps . for @xmath122 near the the transition lines longer transient times were used .",
    "the terminal points of the phase boundaries were determined with high accuracy . using a chain with @xmath179 sites ,",
    "gradients down to @xmath180 and transients of 231072 , we measured the following critical values at these special points : @xmath181 ( on the @xmath0 line ) ; @xmath182 ( on the @xmath183 line ) .",
    "the new triple point was located at @xmath184 .",
    "this was done _ without _ using our analytic result that identified this point as the crossing of @xmath158 with @xmath147 ; the value of @xmath185 agrees with the predicted value ( of 1 ) for points on @xmath158 .",
    "measuring the density of damage along the gradient of the chain , we could estimate the density exponent @xmath186 . at the terminal points we found @xmath187 for @xmath0 and @xmath188 on the @xmath166 line .",
    "we also measured the exponent at a point @xmath189 which lies inside phase 3 .",
    "this was done by crossing the ds phase boundary while varying the correlations @xmath95 and @xmath94 , yielding the value @xmath190 .",
    "all results are in fair agreement with the expected density exponent of directed percolation @xmath191  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we have rules that a most general damage spreading procedure should satisfy .",
    "these rules are most natural : they ensure that the evolution of a single replica is not affected by the fact that two replicas are evolving simultaneously ; that the range of damage spreading does not exceed the range of interactions in the original single model and that the two evolving replicas respect the symmetries of the model .",
    "these rules can be cast in a formal setting , using transfer matrices . using these formal definitions we were able to parametrize the most general damage spreading procedure for any given model in terms of correlation coefficients between various stochastic binary variables .",
    "thus we are considering _ all possible damage spreading procedures _ and identify different damage spreading _ phases _ in terms of the manner in which this complete set of procedures behaves .",
    "three possible phases can occur ; one in which damage spreads for _ all _ allowed procedures , one in which it does not spread for any procedure and the third , in which for some procedures damage spreads while for others it does not .",
    "these ideas were implemented for the domany - kinzel automaton , for which the three phases were identified , using a combination of numerical and analytic methods .",
    "we have shown that in an extended region of the model s parameter space damage spreading can be mapped onto the evolution of the dk automaton itself .",
    "this observation supports grassberger s recent conjecture to the effect that damage spreading is in the directed percolation universality class .",
    "this was also confirmed by numerical tests ( performed in regions where the above mentioned mapping does not hold ) .",
    "in this appendix we explain in detail how correlated random variables @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , that govern the evolution of the dk - model , can be generated .",
    "we also prove the allowed ranges for @xmath95 and @xmath94 , given in eq .",
    "( [ parameterrange ] ) .",
    "finally , we explain the manner in which minimal correlations are given by the expression presented in sec . v.",
    "since in each update @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 can be either zero or one , there are eight possible combinations . by @xmath192",
    "we denote the ( positive ) probability to generate the combination @xmath193 .",
    "these probabilities are normalized by : @xmath194 once the probabilities @xmath192 are known , the numbers @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 can be generated by taking one uniformly distributed random number @xmath57 and selecting one of the eight possible outcomes according to the probabilities @xmath192 .",
    "the three - point correlation functions can be represented in terms of the @xmath195 s : @xmath196 appropriate combinations of these probabilities are related to two- and one - point functions and therewith to the entries of the transfer matrix ; for example , @xmath197 collecting all identities of this type , we obtain seven equations : @xmath198 together with the normalization ( [ pinorm ] ) these equations determine all probabilities @xmath192 : @xmath199 since all @xmath195 have to be positive , we obtain six inequalities : @xmath200 for a given choice of the parameters @xmath92 these inequalities imply restrictions on the correlation parameters @xmath95 , @xmath201 and @xmath76 . the allowed range of these parameters can be derived as follows .",
    "first let us consider the restrictions on @xmath95 .",
    "( [ restrict1 ] ) implies that @xmath202 whereas eq .",
    "( [ restrict2 ] ) leads to the condition @xmath203 .",
    "both of them can be combined by requiring @xmath204 for a given @xmath95 in this interval the maximal ranges of @xmath94 and @xmath76 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ restrict1])-([restrict2 ] ) . however , since we do not explicitly use the three - point correlation parameter @xmath76 , we are only interested in the maximal range of @xmath94",
    ". this range can be obtained by inserting the extremal values for @xmath76 into eq .",
    "( [ restrict2 ] ) , that is @xmath205 on the l.h.s . and @xmath206 on the r.h.s .",
    "thus for a given @xmath95 in the range ( [ alpharange ] ) the corresponding maximal range of @xmath94 is : @xmath207 in other words , if @xmath95 and @xmath94 satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ alpharange])-([betarange ] ) , we are able to find some  @xmath76 such that all probabilities @xmath192 are positive .",
    "in order to determine the phase boundaries @xmath146 and @xmath156 , one has to identify situations where the correlations are extremal",
    ". for given parameters @xmath92 maximal correlations ( minimal damage ) simply correspond to taking the upper bounds of the intervals ( [ alpharange ] ) and ( [ betarange ] ) : @xmath208 in case of minimal correlations ( maximal damage ) the situation is more complicated since the correlation parameter @xmath130 appears on the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ betarange ] ) with a negative sign .",
    "therefore by increasing @xmath130 , the minimal value of @xmath131 may decrease which makes it impossible to predict where damage is maximal .",
    "however , we can show that in the triangular region _ above _ line @xmath209 in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , where @xmath210 , this problem does not arise . in this region eq .",
    "( [ alpharange ] ) implies that @xmath211 and therewith @xmath212 . hence according to eq .",
    "( [ restrict1 ] ) the minimal value that @xmath213 can have is @xmath214 . inserting this value into eq .",
    "( [ restrict2 ] ) we get the inequality @xmath215 which replaces eq .",
    "( [ betarange ] ) in the specified triangle . in this inequality @xmath130 occurs with a positive sign on the l.h.s . and therefore the case of minimal correlations",
