    "the direct imaging of extrasolar planets ( esps ) presents a daunting technical challenge . the small angular separation from the host star places the planet within a diffracted starlight halo many decades brighter than the planet itself .",
    "a coronagraph suppresses this diffraction whilst preserving the angular resolution and flux of the planet through to the final imaging camera .",
    "there are many coronagraphic designs and they all represent the fundamental trade - off between throughput , angular resolution and diffraction suppression as a function of position in the final image .    the prototypical coronagraph @xcite is an imaging camera consisting of optics that form two intermediate focal planes .",
    "the first is an image plane where an occulting mask is used to remove the airy disk and diffraction rings of the central star .",
    "a sharp edged mask in the image plane introduces high spatial frequency components in the wavefront , which are masked out in the subsequent pupil plane with an undersized pupil stop ( the lyot stop ) .",
    "the original design is not optimal for esp detection , and results in reduced throughput and angular resolution .    encouraged by the discovery of nearly two hundred esps through radial velocity searches around nearby stars @xcite ,",
    "the potential of directly imaging terrestrial sized planets has fueled research in a wide range of coronagraphic designs , a large selection of which are reviewed , analyzed and compared in @xcite . in that paper , they concentrate on designs suitable for space - based telescopes consisting of an unobstructed circular aperture , which produce contrast ratios in the regime of @xmath10 .",
    "most of the designs considered modify the incoming wavefront by placing apodizing masks in the image plane and/or in the pupil plane of the coronagraph .",
    "the designs can be further subdivided by whether they modify the amplitude or the phase of the wavefront , or some combination of the two .",
    "most of the image plane apodizing methods are sensitive to tip - tilt errors and the finite size of the stellar disk @xcite , allowing light from the primary star to add an extra source of noise and reduce the achievable contrast@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies have indicated that eighth - order band limited masks , which are designed to be insensitive to small amounts of low order aberrations @xcite , show promise for providing deep suppression over small opening angles and with theoretical throughputs of up to 50% and iwas ( inner working angles ) of @xmath11 .",
    "laboratory experiments on manufacturing process limited masks gave a measurement of 15% throughput for a designed transmission of 20% @xcite .",
    "alternative methods for suppressing diffraction rely on variable transmission masks in the pupil plane , either as binary masks @xcite or as graded ( apodized ) transmission masks @xcite .",
    "pupil apodizing methods generate field invariant psfs and so do not suffer from the tight alignment tolerances required by image plane masks , and their suppression is not affected by the angular size of the target star .",
    "@xcite considered a phase apodization algorithm from @xcite , which uses a square pupil and provides deep suppression over a 90 degree opening angle with a 60% loss of light from the central psf core .",
    "our independently developed phase apodization algorithm can generate psfs for more generalized pupil geometries ( including pupils with secondary obscurations ) over an opening angle of 180 degrees .",
    "for the phase plate in this paper , the fwhm of the airy core increases by 10% and produces a considerably smoothed zone of suppressed diffraction from 5 to 6 decades below that of the core , at a modest cost of light ( 29% ) from the central airy core of the imaged object and an iwa of @xmath12 .",
    "the sensitivity of close - in searches is increased by the subtraction of the psf of the telescope , determined either by an analytical model , images of a nearby reference star of similar brightness , or by using the rotation of the target star on the night sky to construct a model psf with the putative companion signal removed by median combining the individual exposures . in the ideal high signal - to - noise limit , the psf images subtract cleanly , leaving an image limited by photon noise following the diffraction pattern . in reality , psf subtracted images show considerable small scale structure , and these systematic aberrations ( thought to be caused by optical flexure within the telescope and camera system ) limit the detection sensitivity of faint companions at small angular separations .",
    "the 6.5 m mmt ao system @xcite is the first realization of a large aperture telescope coupled with a deformable secondary mirror that delivers an ao - corrected @xmath13 beam . at longer wavelengths @xmath14 , the mmt ao system is uniquely sensitive because of the lower level of background light it emits at infrared wavelengths compared to conventional ao systems on larger telescopes @xcite  typically twice as efficient as the keck telescopes at @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , the mid - infrared wavelengths are well suited to the detection of hot extrasolar planets due to their enhanced thermal emission detectable through the earth s atmospheric transmission window at 5 microns @xcite . where thermal telescope emission is the dominant source of background photons , a reduction in emissivity corresponds to a direct reduction in exposure time to reach a particular sensitivity . using measurements of sky frame fluxes at two differing airmasses , the emissivity of the telescope , ao system and clio camera is estimated to be 10% @xcite .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the 25 - 50% of other conventional mid - ir ao systems .    in this paper",
    "we present a new method to suppress diffraction in an astronomical   we present the basic theory behind the optic , and section [ obs ] describes the first on - sky app observations and the data reduction .",
    "section [ expect ] compares the expected point spread function using the app with the mmt ao system , and the calculated sensitivity and limits to the achieved contrast ratios are in section [ compare ] .",
    "section [ muher ] presents an initial scientific observation using the app and we discuss the implications for future observations in section [ concl ] .",
    "the starlight halo against which detection of faint companions are to be made consists of a deterministic diffraction pattern ( or point spread function , psf ) , and a speckled halo caused mostly by residual phase errors left over by the ao system , and to a lesser degree by scintillation over the pupil .",
    "there are also inevitably going to be optical imperfections in the optics , e.g. small phase aberrations and transmission variations that will lead to faint static and semi - static speckles in the halo .",
    "for the mmt , these have not yet been seen or characterized .",
    "the scintillation halo is expected to be fainter than the ao - residual phase halo , and at high strehl , the diffraction pattern is the brightest . reducing",
    "the diffraction halo is the first step in improving the s / n of a faint planet near the star , since it reduces the `` noise '' against which the detection is made .",
    "preserving the light in the diffraction core is also important since it affects the `` signal '' coming from the planet .",
    "the phase plate is intended to suppress the deterministic diffraction pattern to a level below that of the next limiting component of the halo ( i.e.  the residual ao phase errors ) , while doing the least harm to the light in the diffraction core .",
    "the phase plate was designed using the approach outlined as `` method i '' in @xcite .",
    "this method has recently been validated in a closed - loop laboratory experiment @xcite .",
    "the underlying principle is to create an `` anti - speckle '' for each `` speckle '' or diffraction structure within some region of interest ( roi ) within the psf of the star .",
    "( an `` anti - speckle '' is an intentionally - constructed region of the halo which matches an unwanted speckles location and amplitude , but is 180 degrees out of phase .",
    "the anti - speckle is intended to cancel a given speckle ) .",
    "we accomplish this by introducing a weak sinusoidal phase `` ripple '' across the pupil which acts as a weak diffraction grating , causing a small amount of the starlight core to be diffracted into a new halo speckle . strictly speaking",
    ", a line of speckles are formed corresponding to the higher diffraction orders of a grating , but in the limit of a small sinusoidal ripples , the higher orders can be neglected . by using a phase ripple with spatial frequency @xmath16 , we can create a speckle at an angle @xmath17 relative to the star .",
    "for a small phase ripple , the amplitude of the created speckle is proportional to the ripple amplitude , and the speckle phase relative to the core is linearly related to the ripple phase . since the phase ripples are real ( i.e.  only affect phase and not amplitude ) , each created speckle has an anti - hermitian ( antisymmetric real , symmetric imaginary ) counterpart on the other side of the star .",
    "this is the opposite symmetry of diffraction patterns , and therefore it is only possible to suppress diffraction over at most one half of the region around the star .",
    "the region on the other side of the star is reinforced , adding energy to the diffraction pattern there .    by linearly superimposing a set of such ripples",
    ", we are able to reduce the halo over the region of interest ( roi ) . since this algorithm does not take into account the detailed shape of the created speckles , and the process of creating them alters the initial halo in a nonlinear fashion , this approach will only suppress , not cancel , the halo in a single step .",
    "however , by iteration , we can robustly find our way to a solution which nearly cancels the halo over the roi . for small iteration steps ,",
    "the formula for the @xmath18 iteration of the phase is @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 describes the pupil , @xmath21 is the spatial filter corresponding to the dark region of interest in the focal plane , and @xmath22 takes the imaginary part of the result",
    ". equation [ eq : phaseupdatesimplified ] is derived by making the halo within the roi dark without regard for the effect on the psf core or the halo outside of the roi . while this approach worked adequately in this case",
    ", it is sub - optimal in terms of strehl ratio .",
    "the theory has now been extended to include the maximum preservation of power in the diffraction core .",
    "the extended theory will be presented in a later paper .",
    "suppressing diffraction by introducing aberrations is inevitably chromatic .",
    "the practical effect is that the dark zone in the halo begins to brighten with increasing bandwidth .",
    "however , so long as the combined halo remains at least an order of magnitude below the residual ao speckle halo , it wo nt significantly limit detection . since the mismatch between the complex antihalo and the halo grows linearly for small variations in wavelength , the intensity of the halo floor brightens like @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the wavelength where the eq .",
    "[ eq : phaseupdatesimplified ] iteration was performed @xcite .",
    "integrating the growing halo over the entire detector band shows that the total halo background grows as the cube of the bandwidth .",
    "this leaves us a reasonable bandwidth with which to work , effectively controlled by the strehl ratio achieved by the ao system . in general , depending on the science goal , working with a wider bandwidth is better , since it collects more photons and gives better speckle noise averaging .",
    "therefore , it is best to use as wide of a bandpass as possible until the diffraction halo starts to become significant .",
    "the mean residual ao speckle halo is unaffected by the phase plate and remains at the same level , while the strehl ratio of the phase plate drops the psfs of the star and planet into the noise .",
    "for this reason , it is better not to let the iteration run to something like convergence , but rather to stop it as soon as the solution becomes `` good enough . ''",
    "since the strehl ratio starts at unity and drops monotonically as the iteration is performed , it is easy to place a threshold and stop the calculation when the desired level is reached .",
    "two apps were manufactured to our computed specifications by _ ii - vi incorporated _ , both using zinc selenide ( znse , @xmath25 ) as the transmitting substrate for the phase pattern .",
    "the wavefront surface was generated using a diamond tool whose pitch depth was synchronized with the rotation angle of the machine lathe holding the app .",
    "the first app used a phosphor bronze plate aligned with the phase plate pattern to mask the telescope pupil and secondary mirror support structures .",
    "initial tests with this first app validated the app method , but the plate has no anti - reflection coatings on either side , decreasing the transmission efficiency of the optic and adding a scattered halo of light from the two internal reflections of the optic .",
    "the success of this plate demonstrated that pupils of arbitrary geometry , such as segmented mirrors on space telescopes , can be accommodated into the app algorithm and produce a nulled region near the target of interest .",
    "we carried out scientific observations ( detailed in section [ muher ] ) with this engineering version , and we were encouraged with the results to make a second , science grade app .    in the case of thermal imaging at the mmt , we also concluded that the thermal emission from the secondary support vanes does not significantly contribute to the noise background of our observations . removing the secondary support masks from the app design",
    "has two advantages - ( i ) the app does not have to rotate to keep aligned with the secondary support vanes , resulting in cleaner background subtraction at thermal wavelengths , and ( ii ) the app surface does not contain high spatial frequency regions required to deal with the presence of the secondary support vanes , resulting in a wavefront that is less sensitive to manufacturing errors in the diamond turning process .    the science grade app is manufactured as a single optic that contains the phase plate pattern , with a gold layer coating that blocks light outside the telescope pupil and within the secondary mirror s shadow .",
    "a broadband coating of magnesium flouride with a measured reflectivity of less than 0.5% ( from 3.2 to 5.5@xmath26 ) provides high optical throughput and minimizes ghost image reflections .",
    "figure [ fig : theory ] shows the design of the app and the resultant psf .",
    "the plate is designed to suppress diffraction from @xmath0 in the focal plane of the camera over a @xmath1 region , forming a d - shaped region of suppression next to the target star .    ]",
    "the surface accuracy of the app was measured using a zygo optical interferometer at the manufacturers optical laboratory .",
    "the mean departure from the model surface is measured to be 70 nm r.m.s .",
    "using the marechal approximation for estimating strehl ratio at the operating wavelength of 5 microns , this corresponds to approximately 0.7% of the incident flux scattered out of the transmitted beam due to microroughness in the app .",
    "the inner radius is set by signal to noise considerations for faint companions .",
    "suppression of the airy pattern comes at a cost of energy from the core , and for this design we chose an app core signal ( the flux enclosed within the first dark airy ring ) that was 69.4% of the direct imaging psf core signal .",
    "the outer working radius of the nulled region was set to match the control radius of the mmt ao system . beyond the first airy ring ,",
    "the suppressed halo is designed to be 5 ( @xmath27 ) to 6 ( @xmath28 ) magnitudes fainter than the direct imaging psf at a similiar radius , although we did not actually validate that claim by measurement .",
    "the phase plate theory is capable of creating much deeper suppressions , although in practice the limit will be set by the microroughness of the manufacturing process .",
    "one notable advantage of using the app at the pupil plane of the telescope is that the suppression is independent of tip - tilt and pointing errors in the telescope , which allows easy beam switching on the infra - red detector .",
    "although it is possible to use the deformable mirror of an ao system to produce the app wavefront , it is more practical to implement a single optic that sits downstream of the ao control loop .",
    "the two main reasons for this are : ( i ) the prescribed wavefront has many high spatial frequency features that require a high degree of actuator control to hold in place , and ( ii ) the wavefront sensor camera will see the wavefront superimposed on the atmospheric turbulence , potentially saturating the sensor . keeping the app out of the control loop allows the deformable mirror to be used in the removal of low - level residual static aberrations in the roi of the app , and to test any candidate companions for coherence with the light from the primary star @xcite .",
    "clio is an imaging camera @xcite designed for obtaining high spatial resolution images with optimum efficiency at l and m band .",
    "it is optimized for imaging extrasolar planets at wavelengths where they are expected to have fluxes significantly in excess of that of a similar temperature blackbody @xcite .",
    "the plate scale of clio is determined to be @xmath29 arcsec pixel@xmath30 from observations of two binary systems ( hd 100831 and hd 115404 ) in april 2006 .",
    "the plate scale error is dominated by uncertainty in the true separation of these binaries .",
    "position angle ( pa ) calibration was also determined from the two double stars mentioned above , and the accuracy is 0.20 degrees , again limited by the uncertainty in the true position angles of the double stars .",
    "the app was placed in the clio camera at the intermediate pupil plane and mechanically positioned into the telescope beam using a motorized filter wheel .",
    "the camera has a pupil imaging mode which allows quick and easy alignment of the app with the telescope pupil . to go from direct imaging to app imaging takes less than five minutes , which is in strong contrast with systems involving an occulting mask in an image plane that require precise alignment for each new target observation .",
    "the app was used on m ( @xmath31 ) observations of hd 213179 ( v=5.778 spt = k2ii ) taken on 2006 july 09 12:10 ut . extrapolating to m magnitudes using color tables in @xcite this star has an approximate magnitude @xmath32 , which is the typical brightness of stars looked at in extrasolar planet surveys carried out with the clio camera .",
    "the data were taken at an airmass of @xmath33 in conditions of variable seeing , typically @xmath34 arcsec at 500 nm as estimated by wavefront sensor camera residuals in the ao system .",
    "we obtained in a set of 16 5-second exposures on target and 16 off target for a total of 80 seconds on - source integration .",
    "approximately 1% of the pixels on the detector show anomalous behavior , including high dark current , high or low sensitivity , and time - varying responsitivity . out of the methods we explored , we found the most robust way to select anomalous pixels was by looking at the sky - illuminated pixels in the beamswitched images .",
    "for a set of exposures making up a single beam , the variance of the sky illuminated pixels is calculated .",
    "any pixels that have significantly high or low variance are marked as bad pixels .",
    "combining the bad pixel masks from the two beam pointings gives a bad pixel mask that is applied to all of the unshifted science frames from the camera , interpolating over the bad pixels using adjacent good values .",
    "a blank region of the array is then used to sample a residual offset caused by the time - varying sky background , which is then subtracted from the image .",
    "the cleaned images are co - aligned using the iraf imalign routine , which performs a cross - correlation in a box of @xmath35 pixels centered on the unsaturated target star to locate the centroid of the psfs .",
    "resampling of the images so that the centroids of the psfs are coincident is done using a cubic polynomial interpolant .",
    "these are combined with rejection of the most extreme pixel values to form the final image .",
    "the cleaned and background subtracted images were coadded to yield the summed image in the upper left panel of figure [ fig : psfsub ] .",
    "the psf with the app can be compared with that for the direct telescope psf in the same figure .",
    "the airy rings are strongly suppressed in the app image .    ) , with the flux and sky background of both images scaled to represent identical exposure times of stars with identical magnitudes .",
    "both figures are logarithmically scaled so that the app peak intensity has 69% of the no plate imaging intensity , consistent with the app design .",
    "the lower two panels show the detection sensitivity of the two psfs under psf subtraction .",
    "fake sources with a magnitude 7.5 fainter than the star have been added at 0.4 arcsecond increments @xmath36 from 0.4 to 1.6 arcseconds . the app image intensity",
    "is scaled so that the fake source has the same signal in both psf subtracted images , showing that even with the lower signal to noise the sources are more easily identified with the smoother , suppressed background and are not lost in the systematic airy ring psf subtraction.[fig : psfsub ] ]    the utility of the app becomes apparent when compared to direct imaging and psf subtracted images .",
    "figure [ fig : psfsub ] shows the telescope psf comparing direct imaging with app imaging .",
    "the airy rings are strongly suppressed in the app image , with only the time smoothed servo lag halo visible within 0.5 arcseconds of the target star .",
    "this is very much in evidence in the psf subtracted images in the lower row . here",
    ", four fake sources have been added to half the dataset and the other half of the data are used to subtract off the psf .",
    "the background noise has been scaled in both the direct and app imaging to represent identical on - source integrations of 40 seconds through the m filter .",
    "the app is background noise limited up to @xmath4 of the target star , whilst in the direct imaging case the closest fake source is confusion noise limited by the airy ring residuals .",
    "the `` measured light profile '' line in the upper panel of figure [ fig : radplots ] represents the measured light profile of the clio app image for a total on - sky integration of 80 seconds , normalized to the mean flux in the airy disk of the star .",
    "the flux at a given radius is calculated by azimuthally averaging over a 150 degree wedge centered on the target star in the middle of the roi .",
    "this curve can be compared with the dotted line labeled `` turbulence - free model '' , which represents the theoretical app psf in the limit of perfect ao correction over the m band . comparing the measured light profile and turbulence - free model in the upper panel of figure [ fig : radplots ]",
    ", we see that the measured starlight in the region of the suppressed halo is 4 to 5 magnitudes brighter than the theoretical profile .",
    "this brightening is due to the residual aberration of the ao corrected wavefront , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the strehl ratio for our observations is typically around 90% ( see next section for calculation ) .",
    "the ultimate limit to high - contrast imaging is from low - order ( a few cycles / aperture ) wavefront errors which cause speckles within a few @xmath37 of the star .",
    "the diffraction suppression provided by the app allows us for the first time to directly measure the residual speckle intensities resulting from low - order ( a few cycles / aperture ) wavefront errors , allowing us to estimate the low - order performance of the ao system .    using the app has an effect on both the signal and the noise portions of the detection sensitivity .",
    "the app is designed to improve detection sensitivity by suppressing the diffraction halo , but at the cost of light taken by the plate from the psf core .",
    "furthermore , other sources of background light will become the sensitivity constraint once the diffraction halo has been sufficiently suppressed , making deep halo suppression and its concomitant loss of strehl ratio a liability . for a bright star ,",
    "the next constraint in the sensitivity is the residual ao speckle halo , while for a fainter star the constraint might be photon noise from the thermal sky background . the azimuthally averaged light profile for the measured clio app data is shown as the solid line in the upper panel of figure [ fig : radplots ] .",
    "over the suppressed - diffraction region of the halo , the residual scattered halo is consistent with an angular dependence of @xmath38 , which can be explained with a time - lag in the applied ao correction @xcite .",
    "this halo results when the wind advects the aberration - causing turbulence past the telescope aperture and there is a processing lag , @xmath39 , between the wavefront measurement and the application of the corresponding correction .",
    "since the processing lag and the wind velocity multiply to give the shift between the actual wavefront and the ao - corrected version , the lag error can be parameterized by the distance @xmath40 which is the length of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean wind velocity .",
    "noise level , representing the sensitivity curve for the upper plot .",
    "the procedure for generating these curves is discussed in sections [ expect ] & [ compare ] . [",
    "fig : radplots ] ]    to understand and quantify the ao halo in conjunction with the app , we simulated our ao system with the app phase profile to model the combined psf .",
    "as described in @xcite , a single taylor wind flow results in a halo of speckles that are not evenly distributed with azimuth angle @xmath43 , but instead form a two - lobed distribution ( proportional to cos@xmath44 ) aligned with the wind direction projected on the sky . since this was not an obvious feature of our data , we modeled the wind as two superimposed turbulence layers oriented @xmath45 from each other , resulting in a reasonably isotropic speckle halo .",
    "the two simulated winds were given the same speeds , but with independent kolmogorov phase screens @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous residual phase error was computed by shifting and summing the two wind layer phase screens to the positions appropriate to time @xmath46 , and then subtracting a low - pass - filtered version of the combined phase appropriate to time @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting residual wavefront was then passed through a fourier optics model of the mmt , including the app phase , resulting in an instantaneous psf of the telescope .",
    "the phase screens were computed using a fourier synthesis method on a @xmath48 point grid , modeling a periodic 32 m square region characterized by kolmogorov turbulence with a characteristic fried length @xmath49 .",
    "the evolving psf was computed for 256 steps across the screen , shifting the array to simulate the wind evolution over a time of @xmath50 seconds .",
    "each frame represents an instantaneous realization of the atmosphere . by averaging together all the 256 frames , the resultant psf represents a telescope integration that covers a 32 m patch of atmosphere moving across the telescope pupil .",
    "the 5 second exposures from the clio camera fix the exposure time , and so a psf for a given length of atmosphere @xmath51 ( and therefore a given wind velocity ) can be constructed by adding up a smaller subset of the 256 frames . since a smaller number of exposures sums over fewer speckles , the variance in the individual exposures will be higher .    by varying the wind lag distance and the fried length in the ao models , we produced different modeled contrast ratio curves , the best fit of which is shown as the `` turbulence model '' in the upper panel of figure [ fig : radplots ] .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath52 cm at the wavelength of @xmath53 nm and a wind lag distance of @xmath54 cm in each of the two wind directions .    these parameters",
    "were then used to generate 16 simulated exposures , processed in an identical manner to the real dataset .",
    "both the 16 clio exposures and the 16 simulated exposures are averaged and the per pixel variance of the individual exposures about the resultant mean was calculated .",
    "this variance is divided by the number of images averaged together and then square rooted .",
    "the azimuthal mean of this quantity is then plotted as a function of radius over the image region identical to that in the upper panel , and we refer to these as our `` measured sensitivity curve '' and `` turbulence model sensitivity for 80 seconds exposure '' in the lower panel of figure [ fig : radplots ] .",
    "these represent the @xmath55 sensitivity limit of the app in detecting a faint companion using model psf subtraction ( see next section ) .",
    "the width of the sensitivity curve is determined by the wind speed during the 80 seconds of total integration . by varying the number of summed frames from the total block of 256 frames , the best match to the sensitivity curve was determined to be 192 frames , implying that @xmath56 , which yields a mean wind velocity of @xmath57 .",
    "recent measurements of wind velocity as a function of altitude using scidar @xcite show that the velocity of turbulent layers at altitudes of 10 km can be considerably larger than the wind velocity measured at ground level ( @xmath58 compared to @xmath59 for observations at san pedro martir in 2000 ) , and this trend is consistent with our measured ground layer wind velocity of @xmath60 .    ]    to determine how well our ao system was performing with the app at 5 microns , we wanted to determine what the strehl ratio of our data were .",
    "figure [ fig : ee ] shows the the fraction of the total flux enclosed within a given radius for various psfs .",
    "the energy within the radius of the first dark ring indicates the fraction of energy in the image core .",
    "the dotted line represents the psf of the telescope pupil , showing that the encircled energy of the core is 74% , consistent with a pupil with central obscuration .",
    "the dot - dashed curve represents the modeled psf of the telescope with an ideal app , which is 69.8% of the encircled energy of the ideal psf , or 52% .",
    "the data from clio with the app gives an encircled energy of 45% .",
    "the ratio of the encircled energy from the measured app to the ideal app gives an estimate of how efficiently the ao system is working at keeping flux within the core of the image ( and hence , the flux of the planet in its core ) and this is approximately 86% .",
    "this encircled energy ratio is analogous to the strehl ratio used in quantifying the wavefront correction of ao systems , and this is consistent with the strehl ratio expected for the mmt ao system running at 550hz with a 56 zernike mode level of correction . using the marechal approximation we derive a mean wavefront error of 220 nm .",
    "an observation looking for point - like sources goes further by performing psf subtraction on the data . for scientific observations over many hours of on - source exposure , the camera and phase plate",
    "are fixed relative to the telescope during the set of exposures , so that the sky and background light distribution within the whole optical system does not systematically change . for",
    "our alt - az mounted telescope , the sky then rotates as a function of hour angle .",
    "we construct a master psf by taking the median of the individual exposures , which rejects the flux from faint compansions whilst building a high signal to noise psf that includes the static aberrations in the system .",
    "this master psf is subtracted off the individual exposures , and each frame is rotated in software to align the sky orientation with the image orientation .",
    "the images are added together to form a final psf - subtracted image .",
    "the `` measured sensitivity '' and `` turbulence model sensitivity '' in the lower panel of figure [ fig : radplots ] closely match each other , and so we conclude that the total integration of 80 seconds represents a significant sampling of the turbulence power spectrum of the atmosphere .",
    "if we assume that the sensitivity curve will increase as the square root of the number of coadded exposures , we can estimate the expected sensitivity for a one hour exposure , labeled as `` turbulence model sensitivity for 1 hour integration '' .",
    "this sensitivity curve is dominated by two components - one attributed to the photon shot noise of the sky background which scales as @xmath61 @xcite and is present at large radii , and a residual speckle halo noise component . in the limit of the residual speckle halo noise and sky background noise statistics",
    "both reducing as @xmath61 , the halo noise is fixed with respect to the sky background noise , and the transition point for background noise dominating over halo noise is at about 0.8 arcseconds ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "if the star is brighter than m=3 , then the residual speckle halo noise will be dominant out to larger radii , and if the star is fainter , the sky background noise will become dominant at smaller and smaller radii .    assuming that other static and quasi - static aberrations do not become dominant in longer integrations",
    ", we expect to be able to detect sources of @xmath62 with a @xmath7 confidence level in one hour at a separation of @xmath63 with the estimates of sensitivity made with our ao simulations",
    ". our next investigation will be to obtain a much longer exposures with the app and determine what sources of noise appear as the sky background noise is reduced , and to develop a suitable theory to characterize them .",
    "her a system taken with an earlier prototype app .",
    "note how the secondary companion ( to the lower right ) has the same psf as the primary star.[fig : muher ] ]",
    "in order to demonstrate that the principle of the app was valid , we observed a recently nearby binary system , with the purpose of confirming the nature of the fainter component as determined by @xcite and to obtain astrometric measurements for determining the dynamical mass of the system .",
    "the star @xmath64 her a was observed with the earlier prototype of the app at 2006 april 13 ut 12:48 using the clio camera at the @xmath13 cassegrain focus of the mmto 6.5 m telescope on mount hopkins , with the ao system operating in closed loop on the target star .",
    "the data were observed in the m filter ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "our astrometric and photometric observations of the @xmath64 her a system are listed in table [ tbl-2 ] with the image shown in figure [ fig : muher ] .",
    "although we performed relative photometry in both m and m , our images are saturated ( and thus non - linear ) by a few percent in the m band images , and so that relative photometry is not reported here .",
    "@xcite give @xmath66 photometry for the @xmath64 her a system that used a 15 arcsecond aperture , including both the components .",
    "our m band differential photometry , combined with the typical @xmath67 color of @xmath64 her a and @xmath68 results in an absolute magnitude of @xmath69 . the resultant colors for @xmath64 her ab are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where errors are predominantly from the h and k band magnitudes , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "examining the photometry of 3 gyr m , l and t dwarfs presented in @xcite , we find that the absolute magnitudes are indicative of a mid - m dwarf , consistent with the @xmath74 color",
    ". using the polynomial fit in @xcite for the spectral type as a function of @xmath75 , @xmath64 her ab is determined to be m4@xmath76 . using the photometry from @xcite",
    "the @xmath77 implies a later spectral type , around m6 - 8 . even assuming a later type star , the @xmath78 color is still a whole magnitude too red for an m4 dwarf but similar to that for an early t dwarf , a conclusion ruled out by the age and the absolute magnitude of the object .",
    "low resolution infra - red spectroscopy of this low mass object , along with further astrometric observations over the next decade will help determine its true nature .",
    "we have demonstrated for the first time that an apodizing phase plate , generating a highly non - symmetric wavefront , can be manufactured and used in an imaging camera and telescope with ao system and produce a scientifically useful degree of diffraction suppression .",
    "the app shape can also be introduced using a deformable element with high spatial frequency in upcoming ao systems to null out regions of interest , but this requires a high degree of closed loop control and also limits the bandwidth available for atmospheric correction .",
    "the app wavefront has regions of locally large wavefront tilt , and if introduced into an ao loop , it can cause shack - hartmann wavefront sensors to become saturated . by using a simple optic downstream of the wavefront sensing and correction of the ao system ,",
    "we eliminate the need for these schemes and can implement , test and refine app designs in short order .",
    "the app gives a significant detection advantage over direct imaging for regions close to the star , typically over the range of @xmath9 for our initial measurements presented in this paper . by suppressing the diffraction pattern and the quasi - static speckles that are tied to them ,",
    "we will then be limited by the noise characteristics of the uncorrected ao halo , which are only just becoming significant in our data set .",
    "further observations will determine the effectiveness and sensitivity we will reach with the app in hour long exposures , and combined with a refinement in the app models , we will be able to detect point sources at much smaller separations than is possible with direct imaging and classical coronagraphs alone .",
    "the suppression of diffraction limits the quasi - static speckle noise that plagues the detection of point sources in imaging surveys for faint companions at small angular separations .",
    "the app is simple , efficient and robust compared to other diffraction suppression methods , and can be used in conjunction with other coronagraphic designs , making it a potentially useful aid in the quest for direct imaging of extrasolar planets .",
