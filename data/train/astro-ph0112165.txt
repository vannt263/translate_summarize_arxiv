    "psr  b1757@xmath024 is a 124-ms radio pulsar near the supernova remnant ( snr ) g5.4@xmath01.2 .",
    "radio timing observations show that the pulsar has characteristic age 16  kyr and spin - down luminosity @xmath4  erg  s@xmath3 ( manchester et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the pulsar is at the tip of a flat - spectrum radio protuberance just outside the west side of the snr shell .",
    "the protuberance consists of a small , roughly spherical nebula , g5.27@xmath00.90 , that has a highly collimated finger of emission on its western side .",
    "the pulsar is at the westernmost tip of the finger , whose morphology and spectrum suggest a ram - pressure confined pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) ( frail & kulkarni 1991 ) . assuming the pulsar was born at the center of g5.4@xmath01.2 and that the characteristic pulsar age is a good estimate for the age of a system , the pulsar appears to have overtaken the expanding shell , implying a transverse space velocity of @xmath51800  km  s@xmath3 for a distance of 5  kpc ( frail , kassim , & weiler 1994 ) .",
    "however , recent interferometric observations failed to detect the implied proper motion ( gaensler & frail 2000 ) .",
    "they set a 5@xmath6 upper limit of @xmath7  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the pulsar is older than its characteristic age , or that the assumed pulsar birth place is incorrect .",
    "a ram - pressure confined wind should radiate x - rays as part of the broad - band synchrotron spectrum that results from the shock - acceleration and subsequent gyration of relativistic wind electron / positron pairs in the ambient magnetic field .",
    "this is in contrast to static pwne in which a high external pressure , usually supplied by the hot gas interior of a snr , does the confining .",
    "the psr  b1757@xmath024 pwn is of interest as it exhibits the cleanest and most extreme bow - shock plus tail morphology of any such system , suggesting that it may exemplify the class of ram - pressure confined pwn most ideally .",
    "we summarize here the first x - ray detection of psr  b1757@xmath024 .",
    "details of this result can be found in kaspi et al .",
    "the psr  b1757@xmath024 field was observed on 2000 april 12 for 19.6  ks using the s3 back - illuminated chip on the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) instrument aboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. the acis image ( fig .",
    "1 , left ) reveals a faint point source near the radio pulsar position , and a fainter tail of emission on the eastern side , similar to the radio emission .",
    "figure 1 ( right ) shows the distribution of counts as a function of distance from the point source . with respect to the mean and the western side",
    ", the eastern side clearly has an overdensity of counts extending nearly 20@xmath1 from the point source .",
    "careful astrometry confirms the coincidence between the x - ray point source and the radio pulsar .",
    "the spectrum of the point source is well characterized with both an absorbed power - law model , as well as an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the spectrum of the fainter tail emission is not well determined , however it is suggested of relatively hard emission , having power - law index of @xmath21 .",
    "the x - ray point source is likely to be non - thermal pulse - phase - averaged magnetospheric emission from the radio pulsar itself .",
    "the observed 210  kev unabsorbed luminosity , for a distance @xmath8  kpc is @xmath9  erg  s@xmath3 , assuming beaming angle @xmath10  sr ( see kaspi et al .",
    "this implies an efficiency of conversion of spin - down luminosity into magnetospheric emission of @xmath11 .",
    "this efficiency , as well as the measured power - law photon index , are consistent with those observed for the magnetospheric components of other radio pulsars ( becker & trmper 1997 ) .    the tail x - ray emission is likely to be synchrotron radiation from the shocked pulsar wind .",
    "the observed x - ray tail extends nearly 20@xmath1 , or 0.48  pc for a distance of 5  kpc , to the east of the pulsar , nearly as long as the detected radio tail .",
    "the upper limit on the transverse velocity of @xmath12  km  s@xmath3 implies the time since the pulsar was at the eastern - most tip of the observed x - ray emission must be @xmath13  yr . the synchrotron lifetime of a photon of energy @xmath14 ( in kev ) in a magnetic field @xmath15 ( in units of @xmath16  g ) is @xmath17  @xmath18 .",
    "thus , for @xmath19  yr and @xmath20  kev , @xmath21 g .",
    "this is much less than the equipartition magnetic field @xmath22 g expected in the vicinity of the pulsar . here",
    ", @xmath23 is the distance from the pulsar to the bow shock head .",
    "hence , the x - ray tail behind psr  b1757@xmath024 can not be synchrotron emission from pulsar wind particles just left behind after the passage of the pulsar .",
    "rather , freshly shocked wind particles must be continuously fed eastward with a velocity much larger than the pulsar space velocity , @xmath24 .",
    "we can constrain the flow velocity @xmath25 of the wind particles in the tail by noting that it must be high enough to continuously supply particles given their cooling times . thus , the flow time @xmath26 . assuming that the magnetic field reaches its equipartition value near the bow - shock head and that this value holds for the approximately one - dimensional tail region too",
    ", we find @xmath27  yr . as the tail extends to 0.48  pc for @xmath8  kpc , this implies @xmath28  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the tail emission has low flux .",
    "the tail surface brightness in the 28  kev band is @xmath29  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath30  arcsec@xmath31 , with uncertainty of @xmath230% .",
    "the total unabsorbed flux in the 28  kev band in our extraction region is @xmath32  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath30 , with similar uncertainty .",
    "the efficiency with which the pulsar s @xmath33 is converted into tail x - rays in the 28  kev band is only 0.00011@xmath34 , roughly half of the point - source efficiency .",
    "this is in contrast to other rotation - powered pulsars , like the crab , whose x - ray nebular emission is much brighter than the point - source output . without timing information , we can not rule out an ultra - compact nebula as the source of the point - source emission .",
    "several effects may reduce the x - ray efficiency of ram pressure confined pwns .",
    "first , the efficiency of conversion of @xmath33 into x - ray emitting particles may be lower since the reverse shock in the ram - pressure - confined pwns is strong only in the forward part of the head , subtending a much smaller solid angle than in a static pwn .",
    "second , a low x - ray efficiency is expected if the flow time of the relativistic plasma through the tail is shorter than the synchrotron life time . a similar argument",
    "was put forth ( chevalier 2000 ) to explain the low efficiencies of the vela and ctb  80 pulsars . finally",
    ", low surface brightness emission from beyond the eastern tip of the observable x - ray tail , or even from g5.27@xmath00.90 , have gone undetected in our observation .",
    "emission from the direction of that nebula , having x - ray surface brightness half of the acis - s3 background , would contribute roughly two orders of magnitude more flux .",
