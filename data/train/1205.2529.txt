    "the herbig - haro object 223 of the reipurth catalogue @xcite is a knotty , undulating emission of @xmath1  30  arcsec length , and corresponds to the brightest optical counterpart of a large - scale ( @xmath1  5.5  arcmin ) h@xmath0 outflow .",
    "the outflow is located in the dark cloud lynds 723 ( l723 ) , at a distance of 300  @xmath4  150  pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is associated with the low - mass multiple system vla  2 ( @xcite ) , being one of the components of this system ( vla  2a ) the outflow exciting source ( @xcite ) . for a more detailed description of the region and the nomenclature of the outflow knots ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .    in a previous work ( @xcite )",
    ", we performed long - slit spectroscopy in the spectral range 5800 - 8300   along two slit positions , which intersect the peaks of the bright hh 223 knots ( a to e ) , including emission from the low - brightness nebula surrounding the knots .",
    "the spectra of the knots are characteristic of shock - excited gas with an intermediate / high degree of excitation .",
    "the radial velocities derived for the knots are highly blueshifted relative to the ambient gas cloud , and supersonic , as expected for a hh optical jet .",
    "significant changes in the physical conditions ( namely , in the excitation , ionization and electron density ) were found as we move a few arcsec along the slits .",
    "in addition , two velocity components seem to be present at several of the positions intersected by the slits .",
    "it is likely that , at these positions , there is contribution to the emission from both the shocked jet gas and the ambient gas , dragged and accelerated by the supersonic outflow .",
    "note , however , that we sampled partially the spatial emission of the hh  223 knots and interknot nebula by means of the long - slit observations . in contrast , integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) appears to be the appropriate tool to get a wider spatial coverage that includes the whole spatial knot / interknot emission .",
    "this technique has proven to be very efficient to study the kinematics and physical conditions , mainly in the case of herbig - haro objects having a poorly collimated morphology ( see , e.g.  hh  262 , @xcite ; hh 110 , @xcite ) .",
    "taking advantage of the capabilities of integral ( @xcite ) , we made a single - pointing observation in hh  223 , covering the emission of its brightest knots ( a to d ) . from these data",
    ", we obtained the morphology in several emission lines , the kinematics and the physical conditions of hh  223 .",
    "in addition , we were able to compare the results derived from ifs data with those obtained from narrow - band and long - slit observations using similar spatial and spectral resolutions .",
    "this experiment gave us the opportunity to test whether a partial sampling of the emission performed from long - slit data might mask some behaviours of the actual spatial distribution of the physical conditions in hhs such as hh  223 , with a poor collimated and rather chaotic morphology .",
    "we also present in this paper the 3d kinematics of the brightest hh  223 knots derived by combining the integral data ( radial velocity ) with narrow - band h@xmath3 images obtained at three different epochs ( proper motions ) .",
    "the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht ) of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm , la palma , spain ) was used in combination with the integral fiber optics system ( @xcite ) and the wyffos spectrograph ( @xcite ) .",
    "integral links the nasmyth focus of the wht with the slit of wyffos through three optical fiber bundles . at the focal plane ,",
    "the fibers of these three bundles are arranged into two groups , one forming a central rectangle , and the other an outer ring mapping the sky .",
    "the three bundles can be interchanged online depending on the scientific program or the prevailing seeing conditions , as they have different spatial sampling and coverage",
    ". more information about integral bundles and performances can be found at the integral web page .",
    "the data discussed in this paper were obtained with the standard bundle 2 ( std2 ) .",

    "a two - dimensional interpolation was applied using the ida package ( @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "an ascii file with the actual position of the fiber and the corresponding spectral feature was transformed to obtain a regularly spaced rectangular grid . in this way , we built up narrow - band images with a field of view of 47@xmath527 pixels ( @xmath1  14 arcsec  @xmath5  8 arcsec ) with a spatial scale of 0.3 arcsec pixel@xmath7 that can be treated with standard astronomical software packages .",

    "furthermore , knots b and c show a higher [ nii]/h@xmath3 brightness ratio than knot a. as we will discuss later , these signatures are the result of differences in gas excitation through the hh  223 emission , which were only outlined from long - slit spectroscopy",

    "for all the mapped region , which included emission from knots and from the low - brightness interknot nebula , the values of the [ sii]/h@xmath3 line ratio range from 0.6 to 1.4 , and those of the [ nii]/h@xmath3 , from 0.2 to 0.5 .",
    "according to the [ sii]/h@xmath3 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath3 diagnostic diagrams ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , these values are found in hh objects , where the emission is produced by shocks .",
    "in fact , the values derived for the [ sii]/h@xmath3 line - ratio correspond to the spectra with an intermediate / high degree of excitation , following the classification for hhs proposed by @xcite , which distinguished the low ( with a [ sii]/h@xmath3 @xmath20 1.5 ) from the intermediate / high excitation spectra . the spatial distribution of the electron density ( @xmath21 ) is outlined in the [ sii ]  6716/6731 line ratio map .",
    "values of the sulphur line ratio range from 0.6 to 1.2 , which correspond to @xmath21  ranging from 0.24 to 4.2@xmath510@xmath22 @xmath23 ( @xmath21  derived using the temden task of the iraf / stsdas package , and assuming @xmath24=10@xmath25 k ) .",
    "a previous work ( @xcite ) partially sampled the physical conditions in hh  223 by means of long - slit observations , with a slit positioned along hh  223 crossing the knot intensity peaks .",
    "the long - slit data revealed that knot a had the highest excitation spectrum .",
    "a trend of increasing excitation going towards the west was found for the rest of the knots .",
    "the @xmath21  values derived for knots a and b were significant higher ( by factors of @xmath1 5 to 10 ) than for the rest of the knots .",

    "note , however , that the ifs data are better suited to map the physical conditions in the whole hh  223 region covered by the single ifs pointing . as a result , the maps of fig .",
    "[ lineratio ] show a rather more complex spatial distribution for both , excitation and density , which was not self - evident from the partial sampling of long - slit data .",
    "the electron density ( @xmath21 ) , derived from the [ sii ]  6716/6731 map , is higher in the southern , eastern knots ( a , b ) , with @xmath21  @xmath1 4200 - 2700 @xmath23 respectively , than in the other two mapped knots ( c , d ) , with @xmath21  @xmath1 650 - 500  @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath21  map has revealed other density enhancements offset from the knots intensity peaks ( e.g.  the one towards the northwest of knot b , within the low - brightness nebula connecting knots b and c , with @xmath21  @xmath1 1400  @xmath23 ) , as well as a variation of @xmath21  across knot b , moving from the northwest to the southeast , and ranging from @xmath1 850 to @xmath1 2700  @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the [ sii ]  6716/6731 map likely suggests density inhomogeneities within the emitting gas at smaller scales than the knot sizes .",
    "the spatial distribution of the gas excitation is outlined in the [ sii]/h@xmath3 and [ nii]/h@xmath3 maps of fig .",
    "[ lineratio ] .",
    "the emission with the highest degree of excitation is found for knot a , and also around the peak intensity of knot c , while the emission associated with knot b has the lowest excitation degree . however , like for the spatial distribution of the electron density , the overall pattern is very complex , suggesting again smaller - scale inhomogeneities in the excitation conditions within the mapped region .",
    "radial velocity maps were first derived from the line centroids of a single - gaussian fit to the h@xmath3 and [ sii ]  emission line profiles . however , a careful inspection of the spectra extracted at several positions on hh  223 reveals that the emission lines display broad , asymmetric and even double - peaked shapes , suggesting that at least two kinematic components are contributing to the line profile at these positions .",
    "hence , we also derived the radial velocities by applying the cross - correlation technique through the xcorr routine of the dipso package .",
    "ideally , the template must be a high - s / n spectrum , with a resolution similar to or better than the target spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , we lack such an ideal template , and we adopted as template the spectrum extracted at the peak of the brightest knot ( knot a ) , which seems to have symmetric line profiles .",
    "the velocity maps derived from these two methods are in good agreement and show a rather complex pattern in the observed lines .",
    "figure [ vral ] ( upper panel ) shows the maps of the radial velocity field for the h@xmath3 and [ sii ]  emissions . in order to estimate the radial - velocity uncertainties",

    "are highly blueshifted , with values ranging from 180 to 60  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the velocity field shows a rather complex pattern . in spite of that",
    ", some trends can be observed in the spatial distribution of the velocities : the lowest ( absolute ) velocity values , ranging from 80 to 60  km  s@xmath7 , come from the low - brightness emission that connects knot a with knots c and d , and from a shell at the south of the knots a to d intensity peaks .",
    "the highest ( absolute ) velocity values , ranging from 180 to 150  km  s@xmath7 , come from a region at the northeast of knot c intensity peak .",
    "finally , we derived velocities ranging from @xmath2 130 to @xmath2 90  km  s@xmath7  for the emissions arising around the knot a , c and d intensity peaks .",
    "the line profile shapes of most of the spectra suggested a contribution to the emission from two kinematic components . to explore this possibility",
    ", we built two chanel maps , by considering two ranges for the velocity : the higher blueshifted component ( hvc ) , for @xmath26@xmath19 90 km  s@xmath7 , and the lower blueshifted component ( lvc ) , for @xmath26@xmath27 90 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "then , we obtained the emission maps of the lvc and hvc , for the h@xmath3 and [ sii ]   lines , by integrating the signal within the corresponding velocity range .",
    "figure  [ vral ] ( lower panels ) displays the spatial distribution of the two velocity components .",
    "contours for the hvc ( blue ) and lvc ( red ) have been overlapped onto the integrated emission ( zero - order intensity moment ) .",
    "all the knots have emission from both kinematic components",
    ". however , the spatial distribution of these two velocity components does not fully coincide in h@xmath3 neither in [ sii ]  lines .",
    "the most remarkable differences appear for knots b and c , where the peak intensity positions of the hvc and lvc appear shifted .",
    "we measured offset values of 0.9 and 1.5 arcsec in h@xmath3 and [ sii ]  respectively for knot c , and offsets of 0.7 and 1.5 arcsec for knot b. these offset values are reliable , according to the spatial resolution of the data .",
    "clear doubled - peaked emission lines were only found in a set of spectra arising from the bright nebula at several positions south of the knot a and b intensity peak , and from the region covering knot c ( see fig .",
    "[ specdouble ] , upper panel ) .",
    "we additionally performed a line - profile decomposition to reproduce the h@xmath3+[nii ]  6548,6584  , and the [ sii ]  6716,6731 line profiles of the spectra coming from these regions .",
    "the line - profile decomposition was obtained from a model including two gaussian components .",
    "the fitting was performed using the dipso package of starlink , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ specdouble ] .",
    "the two velocity components derived in this way appear blueshifted .",
    "for the higher blueshifted component ( hvc ) , velocities ranging from 180  km  s@xmath7  to 130  km  s@xmath7  are obtained .",
    "the velocities derived for the lower blueshifted component ( lvc ) range from 80  km  s@xmath7  to 40  km  s@xmath7 .    unfortunately , there are few spectra where a reliable line - profile decomposition can be obtained , not allowing us to infer whether the two kinematic components are tracing emission with different physical conditions , having thus different origin or not .",
    "however , a trend is found that consists in the hvc having a higher degree of excitation ( with [ sii]/h@xmath3 ratios @xmath19 1 ) and lower electron density ( @xmath21  ranging from @xmath2 200 to 800 @xmath23 ) than the lvc , which is less excited ( [ sii]/h@xmath3 @xmath27 1 ) and denser ( @xmath21  ranging from 1500 to 6000 @xmath23 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that a similar behaviour for the excitation and electron density have been detected in jets emerging from class 0/i sources and in microjets from ttauri stars ( see , e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . from the analysis of the double - peaked line profiles",
    ", these authors found that the emission from the lvc usually presents higher electron density and lower excitation than the emission coming from the hvc . in most cases ,",
    "the lvc is spatially more compact , and is detected only up at a few arcsec near the exciting jet source , around the jet launching region , being related to the launching mechanisms .",
    "this scenario does not fit our case , because the knots mapped in hh  223 are far away ( @xmath1 0.1  pc ) from the outflow exciting source .",
    "two - peaked line profiles have also been observed in the brighter knots of hh  32 ( see e.g.  @xcite , and @xcite ) . in this case , the profiles have been interpreted as originated from the emission of bow - shocks . however , at the light of the 3d kinematics derived from our observations , it is not clear that the bow - shock interpretation could work so well in hh  223 ( see later ) . in other cases ( e.g.  hh  34 and hh  46 - 47 ) the origin of the lvc at larger distances from the source",
    "is attributed to the gas entrained and accelerated by the high - velocity outflow .",
    "this might be a plausible explanation for the origin of the lvc emission in hh  223 .",
    "however , a more close similarity in the spatial distribution of the two velocity components should be expected in this case .",
    "alternatively , the detection of two velocity components that also differ in their excitation has been attributed to episodic velocity variations in the outflow ( e.g.  hh  151 , @xcite ) .",
    "this possibility ( i.e.  episodic mass - ejection events with variable velocity and direction , as can be expected when the exciting outflow source belongs to a multiple system ) might be a more plausible explanation for the origin of the lvc and hvc emissions in hh  223 .     narrow - band image of hh  223 ( same as fig.[cobertura ] ) .",

    "of 110115@xmath14 ( the p.a . of the east - west co bipolar outflow , see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) and from the measured proper motions , the bow - shock model would give a low shock velocity ( @xmath34@xmath19 25 km  s@xmath7 ) and an orientation outflow angle close to the plane of the sky ( @xmath35 30@xmath14 ) , which is far from the direction derived using the observed radial and tangential velocity components presented here , even taking into account the uncertainty of the proper motions due to the uncertainty in the distance to l723 .",
    "we carried out a single - pointing ifs observation of hh  223 , the optical counterpart of a larger scale ( @xmath1  5.5  arcmin , @xmath1  0.5  pc at a distance of 300  pc ) h@xmath0 outflow , driven by the protostellar source vla  2a , in l723 .",
    "because of its peculiar and poorly collimated morphology , this target was selected for the backup list of a science verification program of a new integral equalized fiber bundle .",
    "ifs observations have revealed to be the best choice to achieve a reliable mapping of the whole spatial emission of such chaotic outflows .",
    "the results derived from ifs data were compared with previous long - slit and ccd narrow - band images looking for consistency .",
    "unfortunately , because of the observing time available for our target in the backup program , it was not possible to acquire an additional pointing to cover the fainter hh  223 knots e to f. new results derived from our analysis of the ifs data are summarized below :    * the morphology of the hh  223 emission shown by the line intensity maps built from the ifs data is in good agreement with the morphology found in the narrow - band images .",
    "one advantage to get line intensity maps from ifs data is the capability of mapping separately the emission coming from lines that usually are included into the same narrow - band filter ( e.g.  h@xmath3 and [ nii ]  6584  ) .",
    "we obtained in this work a map for each of the emission lines that revealed the close similarity between the [ sii ]  and [ nii ]  emissions and some differences between the spatial brightness distribution of the neutral ( h@xmath3 ) and ionized ( [ nii ]  and [ sii ] ) gas .",
    "* we traced the spatial distribution of the excitation and the electron density from line - ratio maps .",
    "these maps revealed the complexity of the spatial structure of the physical conditions .",
    "it makes once again ifs mapping highly appropriate to properly reveal physical conditions of the emission , instead of derive them from a partial sampling obtained from long - slit data . as a general trend , the [ sii]/h@xmath3 and [ nii]/h@xmath3 ratios are consistent with the emission arising from shocks with an intermediate / high degree of excitation",
    "a relevant result concerning the electron density is the inhomogeneities found through the emission ( both , through the knots and through the low - brightness nebula ) , which suggests a clumpy structure that can not be well resolved with the current ifs spatial resolution . *",
    "the radial velocity field has been derived , first from the line centroid of a single - gaussian fitting to the lines profile and , in addition , from the cross - correlation technique .",
    "results found from both procedures are fully consistent .",
    "the velocities are highly blueshifted , ranging from 180 to 60 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "they present a complex pattern in the spatial distribution , with some trend that consists of the more negative ( blueshifted ) values increasing moving from southeast to northwest . *",
    "the spectra extracted at several positions show clear double - peaked line profiles .",
    "we were able to reproduce the line profiles for these spectra using a model that included two blueshifted kinematic components .",
    "in addition , some trend is found that consists of the hvc ( velocity ranging from 180 to 130 km  s@xmath7 ) being more excited and rarefied than the lvc ( velocity ranging from 80 to 40 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the two velocity components , having quite different physical properties and spatial distributions , can be indicative of a variability in the properties of the outflow ejection ( e.g.  episodic mass ejection events having some different velocity and direction ) .",
    "this can be expected when the outflow source is a binary or a multiple system , as was proposed by @xcite .",
    "* to search for the reliability of two kinematic components through all the emission mapped , we performed chanel maps both , in h@xmath3 and in [ sii ] , for two velocity ranges : a hvc ( for @xmath26  @xmath19  90  km  s@xmath7 ) , and a lvc ( for @xmath26  @xmath27  90  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "we found differences between the spatial distributions of the hcv and lvc .",
    "the most remarkable differences are found in knots c and b , where we measured offset values from 0.7 to 1.5 arcsec between the positions of their lvc and hvc emission peaks .",
    "taking into account the spatial resolution of our data , these offsets are reliable .",
    "* we checked the results on the kinematics and physical conditions derived from long - slit data with those derived from ifs . with this aim",
    ", we simulated a long - slit and extracted spectra with a similar sampling along this slit , positioned as in long - slit data acquisition .",
    "this test lead us to conclude that the physical conditions and kinematics derived from long - slit spectra are in good agreement with those derived from ifs spectra that were extracted at the same positions .",
    "in contrast , we found that appreciable differences could arise when long - slit data are compared with ifs spectra that were extracted along slits displaced few arcsec from the nominal long - slit position .",
    "this test reinforces again the ifs mode to get a more accurate picture of such as complex outflows . * comparing the spatial distribution of the gas excitation ( fig.[lineratio ] ) and kinematics ( fig.[vral ] ) , we can observe a similar structure of the maps , which illustrates a relationship between the degree of gas excitation and the velocity . in particular , the regions having a higher degree of gas excitation ( around knots c and a ) coincide with the ones were the velocity values are more negative , while emission of lower excitation ( located north of knot b and south of knots c and d ) also displays less negative velocity values .",
    "we can not appreciate a similar relationship when the maps of the electron density and velocity are compared , probably because the spatial distribution of the electron density has a pattern more complex than the excitation * we calculated the full spatial velocity and the inclination angle of its motion in the plane of the sky for the knots mapped with ifs . from proper motion measurements , using multiepoch narrow - band images , and radial velocities , derived from ifs , we found that the knots have full spatial velocities higher than 100 km  s@xmath7and move close to the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , a change in the jet inclination is also outlined .",
