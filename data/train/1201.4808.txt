    "the work described here is motivated by two remarkable facts regarding one - dimensional free surface hydrodynamics :    * in @xcite it was shown that four - wave interaction coefficient vanishes on the resonant manifold @xmath0 * in @xcite it was demonstrated that giant breather , highly nonlinear , exists on the fluid surface without radiation . moreover , space - time spectrum of the breather consists of waves propagating in the same direction .",
