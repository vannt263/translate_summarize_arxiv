    "the `` one - way '' model for quantum computation , which requires only local adaptive measurements of individual qubits prepared in a fixed multi - qubit resource state , provides a new approach for assessing the physical requirements for universal quantum computing .",
    "the _ cluster state _ on a two - dimensional square lattice is the canonical example of a resource state that allows for universal measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc )  @xcite .",
    "much research on mbqc focusses on properties of the resource state itself , and in particular how such a state could be prepared dynamically via , say , local controlled-@xmath0 operations in a variety of systems for which the dynamics of the individual qubits can be uncoupled , such as an optical lattice  @xcite or single photons  @xcite . in contrast , recent new theoretical results in mbqc have been obtained by viewing the resource state as the ground or low - temperature thermal state of a strongly - coupled quantum many - body system  @xcite .",
    "this perspective allows us to use some powerful tools and techniques of quantum many - body theory , for example , to determine what type of systems permit universal mbqc  @xcite and for those that do , how robust the system is in its universality  @xcite .",
    "one could take this perspective of ground states serving as computational resources as a physical realisation , and thus obtain a new mechanism for creating cluster states or other such resource states .",
    "that is , if a quantum many - body system could be engineered such that it possesses the cluster state as its unique ground state  @xcite , and if the system is sufficiently gapped , then mbqc can be performed by cooling the system down to a sufficiently low temperature and then performing a sequence of adaptive measurements on this thermal state . however , by treating the resource state for mbqc as the equilibrium state of a dynamical system , any measurements that we perform will necessarily disturb it from its thermal state . as",
    "measurements must be adaptive , if they are separated by finite time intervals we are faced with both errors produced by the evolution under the system s hamiltonian and also the cooling interaction with the environment .",
    "these two sources of dynamical error , together with thermal errors , act to reduce the output fidelity of any mbqc scheme that we might wish to perform .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a regular lattice of qubits for which the free hamiltonian has the cluster state as its ground state .",
    "the system is first prepared by cooling via a simple and convenient choice of coupling to a bosonic bath in a thermal state , and we assume that the coupling to the bath is present throughout the computation .",
    "this situation is relevant to an experiment in which a strongly coupled system is first prepared in a useful initial resource state using a refrigerator , and which can not easily be subsequently decoupled from the refrigerator before the mbqc commences .",
    "alternatively , in the context of a laser - cooled atomic system , it may be inconvenient or undesirable to turn off the cooling interaction before the mbqc commences .",
    "we explicitly determine how mbqc proceeds on this system s thermal state as it is perturbed by measurements , with free evolution and cooling interaction ongoing between measurements .",
    "in particular , for the lattice of spins in the presence of a spin - boson coupling to a thermal bath that acts to restore the system to the pure cluster state , we show that the free hamiltonian for the spin lattice state induces coherent oscillations that determine a natural measurement rate . importantly , the effect of the bath may be conveniently described by a single quantum operation that acts on the encoded quantum information within the mbqc computation and which is independent of the particular measurement history . with this result",
    "we demonstrate that mbqc on such a dynamical thermal state is fault - tolerant for a sufficiently low temperatures and for couplings to the bath below a given threshold .",
    "the cluster state on a lattice @xmath1 of @xmath2 qubits may be defined in the stabilizer formalism  @xcite as the unique eigenstate of each of the mutually commuting stabilizers @xmath3 with eigenvalue one  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath4 labels a particular site in the lattice and @xmath5 signifies that @xmath6 is a neighbouring site of @xmath4 .",
    "the stabilizer description allows us to define the cluster state as the ground - state of the hamiltonian @xmath7 with an energy gap @xmath8 . a state in the @xmath9 excited level of this hamiltonian",
    "is obtained by performing @xmath0 errors at @xmath10 distinct sites , and implies that the energy level is @xmath11-fold degenerate .",
    "a useful alternative description of the cluster state , which we shall make use of shortly , is in terms of the action of entangling unitaries between neighbouring qubits on the lattice .",
    "the qubits at all sites are first initialized in the state @xmath12 , i.e. , stabilized by the set of operators @xmath13 , and then for every bond in the lattice the controlled-@xmath0 unitary @xmath14 is performed between the two end qubits .",
    "we denote the product of all controlled-@xmath0 operations on each bond simply as @xmath15 , and the link between the two descriptions is provided by the relation @xmath16 .",
    "mbqc on the ground state of a spin lattice model governed by this hamiltonian involves an adaptive measurement procedure , in which qubits are measured sequentially in different bases until the desired output state is produced , up to pauli operator corrections , on the remaining unmeasured qubits .",
    "the @xmath0 measurements play a special role and are used to remove individual qubits from the cluster state , while sequences of single qubit measurements in the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane are used to implement unitary gates on the encoded quantum information . for the perfect cluster state , the inputs can be taken , without loss of generality , to be @xmath12 on each of the qubits to be measured first .      as some of these measurements are adaptive ( i.e. , the choice of measurement bases are conditional on prior measurement outcomes ) they",
    "must necessarily be performed at different times .",
    "measurements disturb the system out of its ground state , and between measurements this disturbed state will evolve under the hamiltonian ( [ hamc ] ) .",
    "an important property of this hamiltonian is that it is dispersionless , and so any localized excitations will remain local and will not propagate across the lattice .",
    "for example , if a @xmath0 measurement is performed at site @xmath19 the system is projected into an equal superposition of the ground - state @xmath20 and the state with a single @xmath0 error on site @xmath19 , @xmath21 . in the case of a single @xmath17 measurement at the site @xmath19 ,",
    "the system is projected into a superposition of the ground - state @xmath20 and the state with @xmath0 errors on all of the neighbouring sites of @xmath19 , @xmath22 .",
    "this local disturbance remains local under evolution ; however , because the post - measurement state is no longer an energy eigenstate , this evolution must be accounted for when we perform subsequent measurements on neighbouring qubits .",
    "if all of the measurements on the system can be performed on a timescale much less than that of the system s evolution , one may be able to treat the effect of short - time evolution as a small perturbation of the cluster state .",
    "however , one could alternatively make use of a natural timescale of this system .",
    "the equal - spaced spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ hamc ] ) , with spacing @xmath23 , ensures that evolution is periodic with period @xmath24 .",
    "if ( instantaneous ) measurements are made at time intervals which are multiples of this period , the evolution of the system under the hamiltonian can be ignored .",
    "in essence , the energy gap @xmath23 of the hamiltonian provides a natural `` clock speed '' for the quantum computation .",
    "given that the gap in the system will determine the temperature to which the lattice must be cooled in order to approach the ground state , it will be desirable to engineer systems in which this gap is as large as possible ; with this in mind , performing very fast measurements ( i.e. , at a frequency @xmath25 ) may not be possible , and performing measurements at this clock speed ( or integer fractions thereof ) is a much less stringent requirement .",
    "the quantum many - body system with hamiltonian ( [ hamc ] ) is gapped , and so we can prepare a cluster state ( or a close approximation to it ) by cooling the system down to near its ground state though coupling to a thermal bath .",
    "( this cooling can be done efficiently because of the simplicity of the hamiltonian  @xcite . ) performing measurements on the ground state yields excited states that are no longer in equilibrium with the bath and so , if the cooling interaction is present , any measurement scheme that we may perform on the cluster state must proceed sufficiently quickly to avoid a return to equilibrium .",
    "however , we have already argued that the free hamiltonian @xmath26 will require measurements to be close to the intervals @xmath27 , and this clock speed provides a lower bound on the overall duration of the computation .",
    "we now consider the effect of a finite measurement rate in the presence of such cooling .    to model the effects of cooling , we consider a system consisting of a bath of bosons held at a low temperature and coupled to each site qubit via a spin - boson interaction , which takes the form @xmath28 . here , @xmath29 is the displacement operator for the @xmath30 mode at site @xmath4 and @xmath31 are coupling constants .",
    "the full hamiltonian for the system of qubits and bosons is then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the free hamiltonian for the bath .",
    "we note that our results depend on this choice of @xmath0 axis to describe the coupling to the bath . in practice",
    "we may not have full control over this coupling , but in many systems ( e.g. , in trapped atoms ) , to a good approximation the environment couples only to a single spin component of the qubit degree of freedom .",
    "in such a situation , one may take the coupling to the bath as defining the @xmath0 axis .",
    "this assumes we have full control over the cluster hamiltonian , and so may adjust it so as to coincide the @xmath0 axis for the cluster state with the axis defined by the cooling interaction .",
    "we leave as open the question of how mbqc can proceed with a more general coupling .",
    "because the interaction hamiltonian commutes with the set of controlled-@xmath0 unitaries applied to every neighbouring pair of qubits , we can map this system using the unitary @xmath15 to a dual system of uncoupled qubits , with the same interaction @xmath34 to the thermal bath .",
    "we shall consider the master equation for this dual system with total hamiltonian @xmath35 in general , we denote operators in the dual model with a overline bar .",
    "for example , single - qubit measurements on the original system , given by projectors @xmath36 , are now described in this dual model by multi - qubit projectors @xmath37 .    a standard derivation results in a master equation  @xcite for the lattice subsystem given by @xmath38 +    \\alpha_i \\d \\bigl [ |+\\>_i \\<-| \\bigr]\\orho ( t )",

    "the constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 are parameters that depend on the couplings to the bath , @xmath31 , and the temperature of the bath , @xmath43 .",
    "they are given explicitly as @xmath44 we make the simplifying assumption that the couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 do not vary from site to site and for later reference we may relate the temperature of the bath to the coupling parameters through the equation @xmath47    within the dual picture , a qubit initially in the state @xmath48 will evolve in time @xmath49 under a completely - positive ( cp ) map @xmath50 to the state @xmath51 .",

    "more general gates will behave similarly , as we shall show in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] .",

    "consequently , awkward terms can arise when @xmath191 contains an @xmath17 observable .",
    "these terms couple the equations of motion for observables on @xmath188 with observables on @xmath188 plus its neighbours , however for mbqc on the cluster state these equations decouple , from the following argument .    for an observable @xmath191 on @xmath198 containing @xmath199 @xmath13 observables ,",
    "its equation of motion will only have terms of the form @xmath190 and @xmath200 .",
    "however @xmath201 is an observable with @xmath202 @xmath17 s on @xmath188 and a number of @xmath0 s in @xmath192 , the set of qubits that have just been measured . if we iterate and obtain the full set of coupled equations that determine @xmath203 we arrive at a dependence on observables without any @xmath17 observables and with at least one @xmath204 on site @xmath19 in @xmath192 .",
    "the equation of motion for such an observable @xmath205 is of the form @xmath206 for some integer @xmath207 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath19 was measured in the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane then initially @xmath208 and so will remain zero for the whole time interval . retracing the chain of coupled equations",
    "we find that each problematic term of the form @xmath203 vanishes for @xmath209 and the equations of motion for the observables on @xmath188 are decoupled provided each qubit in @xmath188 has at least one neighbour in @xmath192 that was measured in the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane .      with a simple markovian description of the errors present in our scheme , we can consider fault - tolerant mbqc .",
    "there are two sources of errors in the dynamical setting that we are considering .",
    "first , the equilibrium state for the system is at a non - zero temperature , and so there are preparation errors due to an imperfectly prepared cluster state .",
    "second , errors occur due to the dynamics between measurements , and can be viewed as storage errors on the qubits for a given timestep . for sufficiently low rates ,",
    "mbqc on a 3d lattice has been shown to be fault - tolerant for both of these sources of errors  @xcite . if the state distillation protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite is used , the error threshold is set by the bulk topological part of the error correction scheme , which in turn can be related to a phase transition in the classical random plaquette gauge model  @xcite .",
    "our initial state is a thermal state , static under the dynamics , prepared by cooling with the bath .",
    "such a thermal cluster state at a temperature @xmath43 is obtained by applying @xmath0 errors to a perfect cluster state with probability @xmath215 .    for the cubic lattice model ,",
    "the dynamics in between measurement steps produce an error channel on the individual qubits no worse than a quantum operation of the same form as ( [ qop ] ) but with coefficients @xmath216 and with @xmath217 .",
    "consequently , the resultant errors for a cubic lattice are no worse than those obtained by application of the local depolarizing channel @xmath218 = ( 1-p_s ) \\rho + \\frac{p_s}{3 } ( x\\rho x + y\\rho y + z \\rho z)$ ] with @xmath219 , on each individual qubit .",
    "the combined effect of these two errors leads to independent errors on each qubit in the lattice with effective parameter @xmath220 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . the threshold for such errors",
    "is given by @xmath221  @xcite .",
    "thus , if errors due to the dynamics can be neglected , i.e. when @xmath222 , the error threshold for preparation errors corresponds to a temperature bound of @xmath223 .",
    "conversely , if errors due to preparation can be neglected , @xmath224 , the error threshold corresponds to a threshold for the environmental couplings of @xmath225 .    if this environment consists of a infinite temperature background parametrized by @xmath123 and a zero - temperature cooling bath parametrized by @xmath226 as in sec .",
    "[ cooling ] , the parameter @xmath211 is a function of these two parameters .",
    "the constraint @xmath227 defines the threshold value of @xmath123 implicitly in terms of @xmath226 .",
    "we may then maximize this @xmath123 over the bath couplings and deduce an overall threshold of @xmath228 for the coupling to the environment provided that the cooling rate for the bath is set at a  goldilocks value \" of @xmath229 .",
    "for this cooling rate the system is not so hot that large preparation errors destroy entanglement , and it is not so cold that large storage errors erase the logical state .",
    "that is , if the coupling to the background environment @xmath123 is below this threshold , it is possible to devise a cooling bath that allows for fault - tolerant mbqc .",
    "when the ground state of a physical system provides a resource state for mbqc we must necessarily take into account the system s dynamics . as we have discussed there are several sources of complication compared with mbqc on a static resource .",
    "while we may prepare the system very close to its ground state , any measurements we then perform on it will produce excitations and for a general adaptive measurement scheme , involving classical feed - forward , the resultant dynamics between measurements will perturb the state and affect the computation .    for the simple , dispersionless hamiltonian ( [ hamc ] ) describing a lattice of spins we showed that measurements should be performed at a characteristic clock speed @xmath230 defined via the energy gap @xmath23",
    ". however , the presence of environmental interactions further complicates matters .",
    "for the environment , we considered both ambient background effects and also the effects of a thermal bath used to prepare and maintain the lattice system .",
    "we found that an optimal cooling exists , which is a trade - off between adequate shielding of the system from a hot background and providing slow dynamics that allow adaptive measurements .",
    "furthermore , the loss in fidelity due to this dynamics is conveniently described in terms of a single quantum operation ( [ qop ] ) that acts on the logical state .",
    "the importance of our results is that under certain conditions , the environment produces markovian errors on the logical state and is thus amenable to error - correction .",
    "our results are general and do not depend on the type of lattice or its dimensionality . in the particular case of a cubic lattice",
    "we may invoke fault - tolerance results for mbqc in the presence of local independent depolarizing errors to obtain a threshold of @xmath231 for the temperature of the prepared state when dynamics may be neglected , and a threshold of @xmath232 for the ratio of environmental couplings to energy gap when the storage errors dominate .",
    "in addition , we obtained a threshold of @xmath228 for the coupling to a high temperature environment provided there is a zero - temperature cooling bath with coupling @xmath233 to the lattice system .",
    "several issues remain that deserve investigation .",
    "for example , we have not discussed possible imperfections in the hamiltonian or measurement errors , both of which would modify the above thresholds . furthermore , the free hamiltonian behaviour suggests the obvious strategy of performing all measurements at or near the clock cycles of @xmath234 . however more complicated measurement strategies may exist that produce high fidelities in the presence of a fixed cooling .",
    "while the above formalism may be adapted to different settings or more particular questions , another key outstanding issue is the effect of finite - time measurements in which the measurements themselves are not instantaneous but are spread over some small finite interval of time .",
    "such a situation requires a more elaborate analysis than the one presented here , especially when the measurement time becomes comparable with the clock cycle time @xmath99 .",
