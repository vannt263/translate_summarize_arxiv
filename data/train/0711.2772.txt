    "galactic cosmic rays with energies @xmath0 ev , below the so called knee in the cosmic ray spectrum , are thought to originate from shocks of supernova remnants .",
    "the shock - acceleration theory was proposed by various authors independently to explain the origin of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite studied the shock - acceleration for non - relativistic shocks .",
    "their theory relies on multiple scattering of charged particles which results in round - trips between the upstream and the downstream of a shock . in the test particle approximation",
    ", shock - acceleration theory predicts that a shock produces energetic particles whose energy spectrum obeys a power - law which explains the observation of the high energy cosmic rays well .",
    "a power - law is obtained by two ways .",
    "1 ) solving the convection - diffusion transport equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "2 ) considering an interaction of test particles with a shock front from the kinetic theory viewpoint .",
    "these independent two theories predict the same result in spite of different approaches .",
    "cosmic rays with energies @xmath1 ev are generally believed to come from extragalactic origins , based on their harder spectrum , isotropic arrival directions on the sky and the fact that they are not confined by the galactic magnetic fields .",
    "some of authors consider cosmic ray production for the relativistic shocks ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the relativistic shock - acceleration is first considered by @xcite considering relativistic kinematics based on the bell s theory taking account of the beaming effect .",
    "later , @xcite,@xcite solved the transport equation with appropriate collision operators .",
    "they focussed on the diffusion approximation .    on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite formulated the shock - acceleration for the arbitrary shock speeds without the diffusion approximation .",
    "their theories include the non - diffusive effect which is important for relativistic shocks and reproduce the same result in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "both of them are constructed in two parts .",
    "first , they calculated @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) which denotes the conditional probability that a particle entering into the upstream ( downstream ) along a direction @xmath4 will leave toward the downstream ( upstream ) along a direction @xmath5 .",
    "they used some phenominological scattering models to calculate @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "second , they calculated a power - law index using different ways .",
    "@xcite calculated a power - law index assuming that particles cross a shock front many times and an energy - gain of each step is fully uncorrelated ( peacock s approximation ) . @xcite",
    "used peacock s approximation . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite solved the transport equation exactly and calculated a power - law index ( vietri s formulation ) .",
    "he considered correlation among energy - gains of a particle .",
    "he used his original formulation to calculate a power - law index .",
    "vietri s formulation gives the different result from peacock s approximation in general but both approaches give the same result in the newtonian limit ( see also @xcite ) .    to calculate a power - law index",
    ", we have to calculate @xmath6 and @xmath7 using some scattering models . @xcite considered the large - angle scattering in both the upstream and the downstream to calculate @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( model a ) .",
    "the large - angle scattering model mimics the scattering in strongly turbulent fields .",
    "it is often supposed that the turbulence can be strong in astrophysical shock environments ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . in this model ,",
    "the initial information of the distribution function is lost when particles are scattered .",
    "so an energy - gain factor of each step is uncorrelated .",
    "moreover , @xcite pointed out necessity to consider the regular deflection as far as relativistic shocks are concerned ( model b ) .",
    "it was understood that return of the particles to a shock surface from the upstream region can be warranted even in the absence of scattering , provided background magnetic fields are at an angle with the shock normal .",
    "this is due to the fact particles return to the shock surface from the upstream by the regular deflection before scattering occurs .    in this paper",
    ", we examine how the variance of the energy - gain factor influences the difference between vietri s formulation and peacock s approximation .",
    "it is useful to know when we can use peacock s approximation because peacock s approximation is simple to derive a power - law index .",
    "it is also important to understand vietri s formulation and peacock s approximation in detail because we can examine validity of the works in which peacock s approximation is used .",
    "first , we calculate @xmath6 and @xmath7 in model a ( where the large - angle scattering occurs at both sides of a shock ) which is suitable for examining the effect of the variance of the energy - gain factor because there is no effect of the correlation in this model .",
    "then we calculate a power - law index using both peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation .",
    "next , we consider model b where the large - angle scattering occurs in the downstream and a particle is deflected by large - scale magnetic fields in the upstream .",
    "we calculate probability functions and a power - law index using peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation in the same way as the case of model a. finally , we examine how the power - law index derived from peacock s approximation differs from the one derived from vietri s formulation to examine the effect of the variance . in model",
    "a , we see that the variance affects the difference between peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation , and explain what the effect of the variance means physically . to examine the above fact",
    ", we show the power - law index changing the shock velocity from a non - relativistic one to a highly - relativistic one .",
    "@xcite calculated a power - law index with @xmath8 considering the regular deflection , where @xmath9 is the shock velocity and @xmath10 is the lorentz factor of the shock velocity .",
    "we extend this calculation to the highly - relativistic range .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize the theoretical framework introduced in @xcite .",
    "we also review peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation . in section 3 ,",
    "first , we consider the large angle scattering in both the upstream and the downstream .",
    "next , we consider the regular deflection in the upstream and the large angle scattering in the downstream .",
    "we also discuss what makes peacock s approximation inadequate .",
    "discussion and conclusion are presented in section 4 .",
    "in this paper we use the shock - acceleration formulation which is applicable to any value of the shock speed in the static situation and calculate a power - law index using peacockapproximation and vietri s formulation .",
    "we assume the test particle approximation and adopt the large - angle scattering .",
    "we also consider the regular deflection by large - scale magnetic fields .",

    "@xmath26 and @xmath25 are necessary for calculating @xmath6 and @xmath7 .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly summarize the method of determining @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the case of both the large - angle scattering and the regular deflection .",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the conditional probability that a particle entering into the upstream ( downstream ) along a direction @xmath4 will leave toward the downstream ( upstream ) along a direction @xmath5 .",
    "first , we explain about the case of the large - angle scattering which was proposed by @xcite .",
    "they assumed the energy of a particle measured in the fluid frame is conserved by scattering .",
    "the probability of displacement @xmath27 of the particle along shock normal is defined as @xmath28 here , @xmath29 denotes a mean free path of the particle measured in the shock rest frame , @xmath30 is the speed of the particle and @xmath5 is the pitch angle cosine measured in the fluid frame .",
    "they use the scattering model that the pitch angle cosine of the particle @xmath5 is determined according to the probability density function @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is independent of the initial pitch angle .",
    "this means the initial information is lost and there is no correlation between the initial distribution function and the last one .",
    "they consider the scattering is isotropic in the fluid frame : @xmath33 next , they defined the probability density function ( p.d.f . )",
    "of the displacement for each step of the random walk as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fluid velocity ( e.g. , @xmath36 is the downstream fluid velocity in the shock rest frame ) .",
    "this p.d.f . expresses the probability of the particle which moves @xmath27 after the particle is scattered once .",
    "then , we can calculate p.d.f . of scattering points at the _",
    "m_-th step , @xmath37 .",
    "finally , they introduced the density of scattering points summed over all steps that is written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 means that the particle is translated by @xmath27 before it crosses the shock front . by using the formulation",
    "mentioned above , we can estimate @xmath6 and @xmath7 after some detailed calculations .",
    "the results are : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the functions which depend on the shock speed and the mean free path .",
    "@xmath43 is the diffusion length which is defined by @xcite .",
    "the total return probability in the downstream , @xmath44 , is not unity , and given as @xmath45 they also calculate the flux across the shock front .",

    "@xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the flux entering to the upstream ( downstream ) .",
    "next , we explain about the case of the regular deflection in the upstream .",
    "the regular deflection is important for a relativistic shock in the upstream . in the case of the regular deflection",
    ", we have to solve the equation of motion in large - scale magnetic fields ( @xcite and @xcite ) . here",

    "we can express @xmath6 using four angles as @xmath63      @xcite developed the calculating method to obtain a power - law index which was originally used by @xcite .",
    "peacock s approximation can be applied to a relativistic shock .",
    "he considered @xmath64 particles crossing from the upstream to the downstream with an initial energy @xmath65 .",
    "we use a return probability @xmath66 that a particle will eventually return to the upstream .",
    "the particle s energy is increased by a energy - gain factor @xmath67 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the initial pitch angle and the last pitch angle for one step .",

    "as particles cross and re - cross the shock , the distribution of energies is broadened .",
    "peacock s approximation assumes the numbers of cycles are large enough to use the central limit theorem .",
    "it is also necessary that the energy - gain of each step is fully uncorrelated .",
    "if particles cross the shock front many times , the distribution of energies can be expressed by a gaussian by a central limit theorem .",
    "in such a situation , we can approximate particle s energy is amplified at the same rate per one cycle and the effect of the variance is neglected .",

    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 , the integrated energy spectrum is written as @xmath80 thus the differential energy spectrum is obtained as @xmath81 where @xmath82      next , we explain derivation of a power - law spectrum given by @xcite .",
    "he derived the relativistically covariant equation for the distribution function of particles accelerated at a shock , which is applicable to a relativistic shock .",
    "his formulation gives the exact power - law index and does not assume uncorrelation among various energy - gains .",

    "in the both cases of model a and model b , the return probability converges along the shock velocity .",
    "this is because the shock velocity converges to one third of the speed of light in the down stream when we use the synge equation as the equation of the state .",

    "both of the two effects ( a large velocity and a small scattering angle ) cancel out each other and the energy amplification converges . in fig .  3",

    "the power - law index converges to 4 for a non - relativistic case which is consistent with the result of the diffusive shock - acceleration .",

    "the power - law index converges in model b , but the converged values are different between peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation .",
    "so peacock s approximation is not suitable for relativistic shocks . on the other hand , in the case of model",
    "a , the difference of the power - law index is the largest when @xmath94 is about 3 , and the index becomes nearly equal when @xmath94 is greater than 10 .",
    "we can use peacock s approximation for highly - relativistic shocks .",
    "we also show that the power - law index calculated by vietri s formulation is harder than the one calculated by peacock s approximation in both cases of model a and model b. we explain why the power - law spectrum becomes hard in the discussion .",

    "moreover , we see the reason why peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation give the different results .",
    "we conclude the variance in the distribution of the energy gain factor affects the difference between peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation in model a.    in fig .  3",
    ", we show that the power - law index calculated by vietri s formulation is harder than the one calculated by peacock s approximation in both cases of model a and model b. this tendency can be understood as follows : let us consider the number of particles with @xmath129 , which have experienced @xmath130 cycles in an average ( see eq .  ( 20 ) ) .",
    "if there is the variance of energy - gain factor s distribution , there should be contribution to the number from those that have experienced less than @xmath130-cycles and more than @xmath130-cycles .",
    "it is apparent that the contribution from the former is larger than the latter , because the energy spectrum obeys a power - law with index larger than 3 . as a result",
    ", the spectrum becomes hard when the effect of the distribution width is taken into account .",
    "as above , we can understand why the power - law index becomes hard as the variance becomes large .",
    "however , this interpretation can not be suitable when the variance is larger than some value .",
    "the effect of the variance converges as we show in fig .",
    "what s more , we can interpret that the effect of the distribution s variance becomes weak as the power - law index approaches 3 because the fraction of particles that are accelerated by the mean energy - gain factor increases .",
    "next , let us explain the general characteristics of the power - law index when we change the scattering model .",
    "we found the power - law index converges as the shock velocity increases in model b. this is the same characteristic as @xcite who studied about the case of the small - angle scattering , although the spectrum derived from the large - angle scattering is steeper than that of the small - angle scattering . on the other hand ,",
    "the index decreases monotonically in model a. for the limit of non - relativistic shocks , the result is consistent with the diffusive shock - acceleration theory .",
    "the difference of the power - law index between model a and model b is large for a relativistic shock .",
    "the difference is small if one uses the small - angle scattering model instead of the large - angle scattering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the averaged energy - gain factor is very large in model a. the energy - gain factor can be written as @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the energy - gain factor can be large for a highly - relativistic shock in the case of the large - angle scattering since the difference between @xmath132 and @xmath5 is large in the case of the large - angle scattering .",
    "on the other hand , the energy - gain factor remains the order of unity even for a highly - relativistic shock both in the case of the small - angle scattering and the regular deflection .",
    "peacock s approximation and vietri s formulation give the different results in general . to see how peacock s approximation is good , of course",
    "it is also important to investigate how many times scatterings should occur enough to use the central limit theorem and whether there is correlation among energy - gains for every step .",
    "such consideration about these effects should be done not only for relativistic shocks but also for non - relativistic shocks .",
    "for example , we probably can not use a central limit theorem even for non - relativistic shocks in low energy range.this consideration might be useful to discuss the boundary between the supra - thermal particle and the non - thermal particle .",
    "the variance might also be considered to calculate the power - law index as we show in this paper .",
    "we have considered the case of the large - angle scattering in this paper .",
    "we will consider the case of the small - angle scattering in the future work .",
    "we thank dr . t. kato for valuable comments and discussion .",
