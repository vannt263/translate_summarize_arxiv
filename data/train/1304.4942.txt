    "[ s : introduction ]    type ia supernovae ( henceforth snia ) are thought to be the evolutionary terminus for a class of binary stellar systems @xcite , the thermonuclear incineration of one or more carbon - oxygen white dwarfs @xcite , a primary source of iron in galaxies @xcite , accelerators of cosmic rays and sources of kinetic energy in galaxy evolution @xcite , and useful tools for measuring cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the peak luminosity of snia  is set by the radioactive decay chain @xmath5 @xcite , and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the timescale over which the light curve decays from its maximum @xcite is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of @xmath6 synthesized in the explosion @xcite . when corrected for",
    "the correlation between peak luminosity and light curve decay timescale , the intrinsic dispersion in snia  distances is @xmath70.14 mag ( @xmath8 7% in distance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not all of which can be attributed to statistical error .",
    "this correction removes the dispersion that is attributed primarily from the difference in @xmath6 mass and other physical effects .",
    "for example , the residual dispersion in the hubble diagram is reduced by excluding those snia  with high - velocity ejecta @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there appears to be a need to correct for the host galaxy @xcite as some properties of the host stellar population are apparently imprinted on the explosion .",
    "accounting for such systematic effects potentially allows for more accurate determinations of the distance modulus from the observed light curve and spectra .",
    "this implies identifying and extracting observable physical effects that may create a dispersion between the snia  light curves .    over the last decade a number of observational and theoretical studies have sought to uncover such systematic effects from variables other than @xmath6 , with the aim of making distance measurements more precise and improving our quantitative understanding of the progenitor systems .",
    "examples include the empirical correlations between the spectra and light curve @xcite , the dependence of the peak brightness on the progenitor metallicity @xcite , asymmetries in the explosion @xcite , central density and carbon - oxygen ratio @xcite , age of the progenitor @xcite , abundance ratios of neutron - rich isotopes to @xmath6 @xcite , and the opacity of the overlying material @xcite .",
    "a consensus is still lacking , however , on the progenitor systems as well as on how differences in initial conditions create variances in the observed properties of snia .",
    "the composition of the white dwarf should have an effect on the nucleosynthesis during the explosion and thus on the isotopic abundances of the final composition .",
    "for example , most of a main - sequence star s initial metallicity comes from the cno and @xmath9 nuclei inherited from its ambient interstellar medium .",
    "the slowest step in the hydrogen burning cno cycle is proton capture onto @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , all catalyst nuclei are converted to @xmath10 when hydrogen core burning on the main sequence is completed . during helium core burning the reaction sequence @xmath11 converts most of the @xmath10 into @xmath12 . from this point forward , stars have a net positive neutron excess @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean atomic number , @xmath16 is the mean nucleon number , and @xmath0 is the electron fraction .",
    "additional burning stages will be driven towards producing more neutron - rich elements at the expense of other elements .",
    "for example , this net neutron excess increases the production of neutron - rich isotopes such as @xmath4 and @xmath17 instead of radioactive @xmath6 in the regions of the white dwarf that produce most of the iron group isotopes during the explosion .",
    "this leads to a linear correlation between the birth metallicity and the peak brightness @xcite . however , the range of birth metallicities @xmath18 is not large enough to account for the full diversity of snia  peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "this has encouraged exploration of other factors that may impact neutronization prior to the explosion .",
    "some explorations have focused on the @xmath71000 yr long convective simmering of the white dwarf prior to explosion .",
    "the convective region is driven by the @xmath19 reaction and extends outward in mass from from the core to @xmath20 @xcite . during this simmering phase",
    "the reaction sequence @xmath21 increases the neutron excess by an amount that depends on the total mass of carbon burned prior to the explosion @xcite .",
    "such studies have established the existence of a `` floor '' level of neutronization that is larger than the neutronization due to the birth metallicity when @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the metallicity .",
    "thus , simmering may mask correlations between snia  properties and the birth metallicity . for the purpose of this paper",
    ", however , what matters is that the white dwarf has a well defined @xmath0 when it explodes , and not how the white dwarf achieved that @xmath0 distribution .    on the other hand ,",
    "observational snia   surveys exploring the impact of potential metallicity effects invariably use the metallicity of the host galaxy as a proxy for the metallicity of the progenitor white dwarf @xcite .",
    "it is well established , however , that there is a relatively large scatter in stellar iron to hydrogen ratios , @xmath24 \\sim 0.5\\,\\mathrm{dex}$ ] , at any given age for stars in the milky way @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite constructed an age - metallicity diagram for 5828 dwarf and sub - dwarf stars from the hipparcos catalog using evolutionary tracks to derive ages and strmgren photometry to derive metallicities .",
    "they conclude that the age - metallicity diagram is well - populated at all ages , that old but metal - rich stars exist , and that the scatter in metallicity at any given age is larger than the observational uncertainties .",
    "alternatively , by following the chemical evolution of homogeneous galaxy models with the evolution of the supernova rates in order to evaluate the metallicity distribution function , @xcite find the mean metallicity of snia  and the metallicity of the host galaxy are tightly correlated when both metallicities are measured as the cno abundance .",
    "if the composition of the white dwarf has an observable effect on the @xmath6 production and thus the snia  light curve , it could have an effect on other elements as well .",
    "in this paper we present a new direct method to measure the electron fraction @xmath0 in the silicon - rich regions for individual snia   by using observed abundances of si , s , ca , and fe .",
    "our method follows from the twin facts that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are produced in a quasi nuclear statistical equilibrium ( henceforth qnse ) environment , and that the abundance levels achieved during qnse do not change during the subsequent freezeout as the snia  expands .",
    "thus , the qnse abundance levels of these elements are recorded in the spectra .",
    "working in reverse , from the observed abundances we can apply the qnse relations to determine the qnse abundances and thus determine a reasonably accurate measure of @xmath0 in the silicon group producing regions .",
    "this method is independent of any snia  explosion model and assumes only that the isotopes are synthesized in a qnse state .",
    "our primary motivation behind constraining @xmath0 is to reduce the residual dispersion in the hubble diagram by correcting for a potentially measurable systematic effect .",
    "our secondary aim is to provide rigorous nucleosynthesis constraints that can guide the modeling of snia  synthetic spectra .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : constructing ] we establish the qnse equations that connect the abundances to @xmath0 and present a method for constructing the electron fraction from the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 abundances . in  [ sec : essential ] we show the trends predicted by our qnse based relations are present in the nucleosynthesis and spectra of common 1d snia  models .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : implications ] we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "in this section we develop a framework based on equilibrium thermodynamics and the conservation laws that allows construction of the electron fraction @xmath0 from the major abundances in qnse silicon - rich material .",
    "we then conclude this section by showing the principle functional dependencies of the silicon group ( henceforth sig ) and iron group ( henceforth feg ) on @xmath0 .",
    "we first select a system consisting of the major sig and feg elements to trace out the most useful equations connecting the individual abundances and their relationship to @xmath0 .",
    "we choose @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 from the sig isotopes , and @xmath17and @xmath4 from the feg isotopes . as figure [ fig :",
    "freeze ] suggests , these are the dominant isotopes under qnse conditions .",
    "conservation of mass and charge can therefore be expressed as @xmath25 from minimization of the helmholtz free energy there follows the fundamental qnse relations @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the temperature , @xmath28 is the baryonic mass density , @xmath29 is the temperature - dependent partition function , @xmath30 is the nuclear binding energy , @xmath31 is the avogadro constant , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath33 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "the molar abundances are the local abundances that correspond to a region of the star associated with a specific @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the nuclei are treated as an ideal gas and we ignore screening corrections , both of which are justifiable assumptions under the thermodynamic conditions of interest .",
    "specification of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath0 , the aggregate molar abundance of the sig isotopes @xmath34 , and the aggregate molar abundance of the feg isotopes @xmath35 is sufficient to solve for all the abundances in a two - cluster qnse environment . at a given @xmath28 and @xmath27 ,",
    "we use equation  ( [ qse ] ) to write @xmath36 and @xmath37 in terms of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "similarly @xmath41 is written in terms of @xmath42 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "this leaves us with four unknowns , @xmath39 , @xmath43 , @xmath38 , and @xmath42 , and , for a known @xmath0 , four constraints : equations  ( [ e1final ] ) and ( [ e2final ] ) , and the sums @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are both specified externally to the solution of the qnse .    measurement of four quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is an equally sufficient basis from which to solve for all the abundances in the silicon - rich region of snia . for our choice of isotopes , equation  ( [ qse ] ) leads to @xmath50 here we assume all ratios of nuclear partition functions are unity .",
    "this is justifiable , as at typical qnse temperatures the nuclei are mostly in their ground state , and all of these nuclei have zero spin .    using equations  ( [ eqqnse1 ] ) and ( [ eqqnse2 ] ) , consider the local sig element ratio @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the temperature in units of @xmath53 .",
    "typical temperatures in the qnse regions where the sig elements are formed are @xmath54 ( a range of 15% in temperature ) ; over this range @xmath55 varies by 6% , from 0.73 to 0.69 .",
    "measuring @xmath55 at a single epoch from the abundance ratios @xmath56 and @xmath48 allows a test of whether the sig material was produced in a qnse state .",
    "with sufficient precision , measurement of @xmath55 allows a determination of the temperature in the qnse region before freeze - out .",
    "we assume for the remainder of this paper that such precision is available and that the qnse temperature is a known quantity .",
    "measuring @xmath55 at multiple epochs when silicon features dominate the snia  spectrum allows trends in the qnse temperature to be assessed .    more generally , a double ratio of the form @xmath57\\ ] ] is independent of @xmath28 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60",
    ". additionally , if the isotopes in this ratio are major constituents of clusters in nqse , then the argument of the exponential will be of order unity and @xmath61 will not vary strongly over the narrow range of temperature for which nqse conditions attain .",
    "a relatively precise value of @xmath61 can then be specified from the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "such a quasi - constant can also be defined for the feg elements . equations  ( [ eqqnse1 ] ) and ( [ eqqnse3 ] ) imply that @xmath62 where we again assume all ratios of nuclear partition functions are unity , and , by construction , @xmath63 is independent of @xmath28 and @xmath58 . over the range of qnse temperatures ,",
    "@xmath63 varies by 28% : from @xmath64 at @xmath65 to @xmath66 at @xmath67 .      for our simplified system consisting of the a few major sig and feg elements ,",
    "equation  ( [ e2final ] ) may be written as @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{eq : ye_major}\\ ] ] we factor out @xmath46 because , as we show in  [ sec : essential ] , the silicon yield is the least sensitive to changes in @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath0 in qnse material .",
    "we may also drop @xmath59 since it much smaller ( @xmath69 ) than the other abundances .",
    "the first step in reconstructing @xmath0 is to determine from observations the @xmath70 and @xmath48 abundance ratios from strata with similar velocities .",
    "measurement of these ratios determines the second and third terms of equation  ( [ eq : ye_major ] ) .",
    "their ratio also forms @xmath55 ( equation  ( [ e : phi ] ) ) , which if near unity verifies that the sig elements were synthesized in a qnse environment .",
    "this relation may also be inverted to determine the temperature of the qnse environment when the sig elements were synthesized .",
    "the next step is to measure the @xmath71/@xmath46 abundance ratio .",
    "usually it is difficult to extract the @xmath4 abundance from the iron lines .",
    "however , @xmath4 is the only iron isotope that is abundant in the regime where both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are also abundant , in the absence of significant mixing of the qnse material with core material .",
    "the reason for this is that in nse , where most of the mass is in the iron group , the requirement that @xmath72 forces @xmath6 to be the dominant abundance .",
    "in contrast , for qnse , most of the mass is in the si - group isotopes and this charge / mass constraint is lifted , so that the greater binding energy of the slightly neutron - rich @xmath4 results in @xmath4 having a larger abundance than @xmath6@xcite . in the absence of large - scale mixing the @xmath4 produced in the silicon - rich regions is physically separated from the @xmath6 produced deeper in the core , so that signatures of iron at early times from @xmath4 do not depend on the @xmath6 decay chain .",
    "therefore , if iron features are detected in the early time spectra ( @xmath73 ) at the same expansion velocities where sig elements dominate the spectral features , they are produced by @xmath4 .",
    "this result is due to material being in qnse and is not dependent on any particular snia  model .",
    "the final step is to determine the @xmath74 abundance ratio . using equation  ( [ e : psi ] ) we write @xmath75 thus ,",
    "the last two terms of equation  ( [ eq : ye_major ] ) are determined and may be rewritten as @xmath76 .",
    "\\label{eq : ye_major03}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : ye_major03 ] ) is our principal result .",
    "highly accurate measurement abundance determinations of the four quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 under the relevant temperatures is sufficient to determine @xmath0 to within 6% because these abundance dominate the qnse composition .",
    "the abundance of any @xmath77-chain sig element , which can be used to improve the accuracy of the @xmath0 determination , can be recovered using equation  ( [ qse ] ) and @xmath78 .",
    "for example , the abundance ratio @xmath79 is related to @xmath70 by @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "as the temperature ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath82 , @xmath83 varies from 0.35 to 0.41 , a variation of 16% . including @xmath84 in the sum for @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ye_major ] ) , adds the term @xmath85 to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ye_major03 ] ) .",
    "other @xmath77-chain non - major elements may be added in a similar manner .",
    "deviation of @xmath0 from 0.5 is primarily due to the major element @xmath71 with contributions from other non - major sig and feg elements . for a more accurate determination of @xmath0 , one can use the mass conservation , equation  ( [ e1final ] ) , to determine the abundances of these non - major isotopes . for example , consider the case when @xmath86 and @xmath87 are to be included . treating @xmath59 and @xmath60 as trace abundance in the qnse regions , equation  ( [ e1final ] ) becomes @xmath88 +   { y_{{\\rm 56ni}}}\\left [ 56 + 30\\frac{{y_{{\\rm 30si}}}}{{y_{{\\rm 56ni } } } } \\right ] = 1   \\enskip , \\label{e : minor02}\\ ] ] which we are going to solve for @xmath86 in the qnse region . from equation  ( [ qse ] )",

    "the derived @xmath86 and @xmath87 abundances may then be used to refine the estimate for @xmath0 by adding the now known terms to equation  ( [ eq : ye_major03 ] ) : @xmath96 \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   { y_{{\\rm 56ni}}}\\left [ 28 + 14\\frac{{y_{{\\rm 30si}}}}{{y_{{\\rm 56ni } } } } \\right ] .",

    "here we suggest the trends predicted by our qnse - based theoretical relations are manifested in the abundances derived from common 1d snia  models . in the next subsection",
    "we describe the simulation model which we use to test our qnse predictions .",
    "we begin with the w7 model @xcite because the synthetic light cueves and spectra from w7 models have been extensively analyzed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we control the value of the electron fraction @xmath0 , which is set by the original composition and the pre - explosive convective simmering @xcite , by setting the mass fraction of @xmath12 : @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a multiplier on the solar @xmath12 mass fraction @xmath126 .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of these w7-like models ( see figure [ fig : freeze ] ) is calculated by integrating a 489 isotope nuclear reaction network @xcite over the thermodynamic trajectories of each lagrangian mass shell .",
    "this post - processing calculation is not precisely self - consistent because the w7 thermodynamic trajectories have the built - in assumption of an energy release from the original w7 model , carbon+oxygen material complimented with a solar @xmath12 mass fraction .",
