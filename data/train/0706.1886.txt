    "+ v.p.potapovs approach to classical interpolation problems research consists in the following . instead of original interpolation problem ( or problem on integral representation ) ,",
    "an inequality for analytic functions is considered in an appropriate domain .",
    "this inequality is said to be _ the fundamental matrix inequality _",
    "( fmi ) for the considered interpolation problem . here",
    "two problems appear .",
    "the first problem is how to `` solve '' this inequality .",
    "the second problem is to prove that this inequality is equivalent to the original interpolation problem .",
    "the study of the second problem consist of two parts .",
    "first , we have to prove that any function which is a solution of the original problem is also a solution of the fmi .",
    "usually this part is not difficult .",
    "secondly , we have to extract the full interpolation information from the fmi .",
    "this means that we have to prove that any analytic function which satisfies the fmi is also a solution of of the original interpolation problem . in simple situations",
    "it is not difficult to obtain the interpolation information from the fmi .",
    "however , in the general case this is not easy , and  we have to apply a special transformation to the fmi .",
    "such a transformation can be applied to every fmi . however , in the simplest situations it is possible to do without such a transformation .",
    "the development of potapov s method began with consideration of the simplest interpolation problem , i.e. the nevanlinna - pick ( @xmath0 ) problem .",
    "the equivalence of the @xmath0 problem to its fmi is clear . because of this",
    ", this transform was camouflaged in the beginning of the theory . however , by the study of of the power moment problem we already can not do without it . in the paper @xcite",
    "such a transform was used in the very general setting of the so called _ abstract interpolation problem_. namely , such a transformation was used in considerations related to theorem 1 of this paper .",
    "of course , the authors of @xcite took into account the experience which was accumulated by previous work with concrete problems .",
    "however , this transformation was introduced in @xcite in a formal way , without any motivation . as result ,",
    "the proof of theorem 1 of @xcite looks like a trick .",
    "this is not satisfactory , because the transformation of fmi lies at the heart of the fmi business .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to motivate and to demonstrate the transformation of the fmi by the simplest but typical example of the power moment problem .",
    "for contrast , the @xmath0 problem and the fmi for it are considered as well .",
    "we would like to demonstrate the algebraic side of the matter .",
    "therefore , we will avoid the entourage of general vector spaces and hilbert spaces in the generality of the paper @xcite .",
    "all our spaces are finite - dimensional . instead of abstract kernels and operators",
    ", we will consider matrices .",
    "+ classical interpolation problems can be considered for various function classes in various domains . here",

    "it is nonnegative if and only if the considered interpolation problem is solvable .",
    "the entry @xmath14 contains the function @xmath3 only , but not the interpolation data .",
    "its form depend on the function class to which the function @xmath3 belongs .",
    "for an interpolation problem in the class ( @xmath1 ) the entry @xmath14 has the form @xmath15 for an interpolation problem in the class ( @xmath2 ) the entry @xmath14 has the form @xmath16 in the entry @xmath17 both the interpolation data and the function @xmath3 are combined .",
    "this entry looks like @xmath18 or like @xmath19 to each classical interpolation problem the following objects are related : +    1.the hermitian matrix @xmath13 , which is nonnegative iff the problem is solvable .",
    "the matrix @xmath20 which `` determines '' the interpolation nodes .",
    "+ 3.the vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 which determine the interpolation values .",
    "+    the terms @xmath23 satisfy the so called _ fundamental identity _ ( fi ) .",
    "the form of the fi depends on the function class in which the interpolation problem is considered . for the function class ( @xmath1 ) , fi has the form @xmath24 for the class ( @xmath2 ) , fi has the form @xmath25 if the fmi ( [ 1.5 ] ) is satisfied ( for some @xmath26 ) , and if @xmath27 is a matrix of an appropriate size , then the inequality @xmath28 \\ m^{\\ast}\\geq 0 \\label{1.12}\\ ] ] holds as well .",
