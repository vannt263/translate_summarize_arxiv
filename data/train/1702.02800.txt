    "scalar fields are often used in general relativity , in particular to discuss the cosmological observations @xcite . in theoretical models of a dynamical dark energy",
    "the `` cosmological '' scalar fields provide an inflationary stage of the early universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review and references therein ) .",
    "one might think that effects of such fields on galactic scales are negligible at present epoch .",
    "nevertheless , since the early works @xcite , it is well known that any presence of a scalar field can cause a cardinal change of the space - time topology in the vicinity of a compact object .",
    "the test body motion is probably a principal mean that can signal , by means of electromagnetic radiation , about the presence or absence of `` non - canonical '' effects related to scalar fields .",
    "the circular orbits around compact objects with scalar fields has been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting property of the space - time geodesic structure discovered in presence of the linear massless scalar field @xcite",
    ": in this case there exist disconnected regions of stable circular orbits . discontinuous structure of the orbits arises also owing to the presence of a quadrupole source @xcite .",
    "one can suppose that such separated rings of orbits near relativistic compact objects is a widespread phenomenon in presence of the scalar fields ( and maybe , in presence of the other fields ) .",
    "if such a separation really exists , this could affect considerably the form of the relativistic fluorescent iron lines generated in accretion disks , which are observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite .",
    "this may be important for observations in order to test gravitational theories .    the present paper deals with test - body orbits in case of a family of spherically symmetric space - times of general relativity , which describe static configurations in presence of a self - interacting scalar field .",
    "we derived exact special solutions of einstein s equations using a known method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that allows one to generate asymptotically flat space - time metrics along with the corresponding scalar field potentials ( section [ sec : setup ] ) .",
    "we concentrate on solutions , which describe either a naked singularity ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) having a positive mass .",
    "then we consider a test body motion in a static region ( section [ orbits ] ) to find conditions for the existence of stable circular orbits .",
    "in particular , our numerical investigation shows that for some set of parameters of the problem there are disconnected regions of stable circular orbits , which are separated by a region where a stable motion is impossible .",

    "this problem is solved by quadratures according to ( [ eq4]),([eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq5a ] ) ; @xmath4 is defined parametrically under condition @xmath16 .",
