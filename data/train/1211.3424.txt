    "recent studies have shown that a considerable fraction of massive galaxies at @xmath17 have quiescent stellar populations ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . among the most massive galaxies ( @xmath18 m@xmath2 ) approximately 40% are no longer forming stars ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , these massive quiescent galaxies have been found to be extremely compact ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and numerous others ) , compared to their likely present - day counterparts .",
    "searches for ultra - dense low - redshift counterparts by @xcite and @xcite found only a handful of compact sources at @xmath10 , which have relatively young stellar populations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dearth of massive , old compact objects at low redshift implies that massive galaxies must have undergone severe structural evolution in size .",
    "errors in the size estimates have been invoked as a possible explanation for the compactness of massive high - redshift galaxies .",
    "initial concerns that the size may have been underestimated , due to an envelope of low surface brightness light , have been addressed with deep hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 ( hst wfc3 ) imaging ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and by stacking results ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the light could also be more concentrated due to the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in these galaxies .",
    "however , spectra of subsamples of these galaxies have shown that the light is dominated by evolved stellar populations , not agns ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the question of whether stellar masses are accurate out to @xmath19 remains , however , a serious concern : an overestimate in stellar mass would bring the galaxies closer to the @xmath10 mass - size relation . to date , basically all ( stellar ) masses have been derived by fitting the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "this method suffers from many systematic uncertainties in stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ) and is essentially untested at @xmath20 .",

    "it is tempting to speculate that the evolution in @xmath140 might have been caused by a decrease in the dark matter fraction as a function of redshift . for galaxies growing in size over time , the dark matter fraction within @xmath97 will also increase . as the dark matter profile is less steep than the stellar mass profile , the dark matter to stellar mass fraction increases with radius , in a similar fashion as shown here ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",

    "in the previous section we have found that in order for the high - redshift galaxies in our sample to evolve into typical present - day early - type galaxies , strong structural evolution is required .",

    "the galaxies would also remain too compact for their mass .",
    "minor merging could offer a solution to the problem , as it can grow a galaxy in effective radius ( @xmath97 ) steeper than @xmath218 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this scenario , the observed compact high - redshift galaxies may simply be the cores of local massive early - type galaxies , which grow inside - out by accreting ( smaller ) galaxies , and thus assemble a significant part of their mass at later times ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we will examine whether dry minor merging agrees with our findings .    from a simple estimate , based on the virial theorem , @xcite predict how the effective radii changes if a massive galaxy undergoes a series of minor mergers . with only eight 1:10 mergers ,",
    "the effective radii can grow by a factor of @xmath219 while only having the mass increase by a factor of @xmath220 .",
    "this is also described by @xcite , who state that if an initial system undergoes a mass increase by a factor of 2 due to accretion of very small systems , then the final radius of the system is four times larger , the velocity dispersion is reduced by a factor of 2 , and the density is reduced by a factor of 32 .",
    "this analytic prediction is confirmed by their hydrodynamical cosmological simulation and consistent with the observational size evolution as presented here .    using hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers , @xcite ,",

    "evolution of the density is also discussed in both @xcite and @xcite . based on photometric data ,",
    "both studies find that while the density within one effective radius is higher at high - redshift , the central density of high - redshift galaxies is very similar to local massive ellipticals . from hydro simulations ,",
    "@xcite show that the central density within 1kpc decreases by a factor of 1.5 from @xmath226 to @xmath227 , caused by dynamical friction from the surviving cores of the infalling systems .",
    "similarly , @xcite show that the central density evolves only weakly , while the density within @xmath97 decreases rapidly by more than an order of magnitude , in good agreement with what we find here . from a study of central galaxies in three @xmath228m@xmath2galaxy groups , simulated at high resolution in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ,",
    "@xcite come to the same conclusion .",
    "they find that the effective density of these galaxies decreases by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude between @xmath229 and @xmath230 , while the density within 2 kpc stays roughly constant .",
    "this is in contrast with the findings of @xcite , who find no evidence for higher mass densities within one effective radius when comparing their @xmath31 galaxies to low - redshift cluster galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the large scatter that they observed in the effective density and the apparent evolution , is simply due a peculiar analytic feature in the srsic profile .    in figure [",

    "the sps - modeling shows that our galaxies have ages ranging from 0.5 to 2 gyr , and show no signs of on - going star formation .",
    "we find good correspondence between the dynamical and stellar masses , with the dynamical mass being higher by .",
    "our results suggest that stellar mass measurements for quiescent galaxies at high - redshift are robust .",
    "we complement our results with stellar kinematic results from other studies at low and high redshift to study the structural evolution of massive quiescent galaxies . at fixed dynamical mass",
    ", we find that the effective radius increases by a factor of @xmath11 , while the velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of @xmath12 from @xmath3 to the present day .",
    "furthermore , we study how the mass density within @xmath97 and 1 kpc evolves with time .",
    "we find a strong decrease of the mass density within one effective radius ( factor of @xmath238 ) , while it only decreases mildly within 1 kpc ( factor of @xmath239 ) . instead of comparing galaxies at fixed dynamical mass",
    ", we also use an evolving mass limit as defined by fixed number density . by accounting for concurrent mass growth in our comparison of high- and low - redshift galaxy populations , we find an even stronger evolution in galaxy sizes ( factor of @xmath240 ) .",
    "we find that velocity dispersion decreases less dramatically with time , differing by only a factor of @xmath16 between @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "finally , for the mass density within @xmath97 , we find a stronger evolution , but interestingly , the mass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution .",
    "this finding implies that massive quiescent galaxies grow inside out .",
    "we examine if our results are compatible with the current idea of inside - out growth through dry minor mergers .",
    "our findings are qualitatively consistent with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations which show similar evolution in size , velocity dispersion , and mass density within one effective radius .    finally , we find that even though the stellar masses are consistent with the dynamical masses , the ratio of @xmath231 may slightly decrease with time .",
    "this , too , is predicted by minor merging simulations , which show that the size growth due to minor merging will also change the fraction of dark matter as compared to the stellar mass within an effective radius .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dark matter profile is less steep than the stellar mass profile , and thus the dark matter to stellar mass fraction increases with radius .    despite the vastly improved accuracy of our derived dynamical masses and stellar population parameters , the broader inferences of our study",
    "are still limited by the small number of high - redshift galaxies with such information .",
    "we have shown that our sample is biased towards younger galaxies , compared to a stellar mass limited sample at @xmath3 , with smaller effective radii as compared to the full population of quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 . only with a larger unbiased sample of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift",
    "can we start to comprehend the final phase that massive galaxies go through in becoming today s ellipticals .",
    "as it has only recently become possible to measure velocity dispersions at high redshift , the stability of these measurements has barely been tested . in this appendix",
    ", we will study the effect of fitted wavelength range , template choice , degree of the additive polynomial , s / n of the spectra , and the choice of stellar populations models .",
    "our sample spans a redshift range of @xmath241 , which means that different parts of the rest - frame spectra will be affected by sky - lines and atmospheric absorption for each galaxy .",
    "this can be seen from figure [ fig : spectra_page_2 ] , we often lose strong absorption features in our spectrum , which affects the region of the rest - frame spectrum that we can fit . here",
    "we investigate how stable the measured velocity dispersion is as a function of the wavelength range .",
    "for the velocity dispersion fitting in this paper , the lower wavelength limit is set by stellar libraries and models , as no systematic high - resolution observations exist below @xmath242 .",
    "the higher wavelength limit is set by lower s / n in our spectra in the observed k - band .",
    "our approach for testing the wavelength dependence of the fit is as follows .",
    "first , we use the full - range spectrum to determine a best - fit polynomial ( 1 order per 10000 kms@xmath6 ) , which is used to correct for the difference between the observed and the template continuum .",
    "next , we repeat the measurement with a zeroth - order polynomial while changing the start or end wavelength .",
    "the polynomial is not a free parameter in this fit , as this would make it impossible to separate between the effect of the polynomial and the wavelength range .",
    "note also , that we use a single template for all fits as determined from the full visual+nir spectrum together with broadband and medium - band data ( see section [ subsec : sps ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : wlrange ] shows the results for the different sources .",
    "the left panel shows the result where we change the starting wavelength , i.e.,the wavelength range is @xmath243 , whereas the panels on the right show the effect of changing the end wavelength , @xmath244 .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the measured dispersions are remarkably stable , even when most of the absorption lines have been excluded from the fit .",
    "the two galaxies with the youngest ages and strong balmer absorption lines ( nmbs - c7447 and uds-19627 ) show a change in the velocity dispersion in the region of the balmer break .",
    "nmbs - c7447 shows an increase for @xmath245 , but decreases after ca h&k have been removed from the fit .",
    "uds-19627 shows an increase of 50 kms@xmath6 when the balmer break is excluded .",
    "when we reduce the red part of the spectrum ( figure [ fig : wlrange ] , right panels ) , we also find a stable fit , except for nmbs - c18265 . after excluding na d from the fit , the velocity dispersion increases by a @xmath32100 kms@xmath6 .",
    "we think this is because nmbs - c18265 has a more evolved stellar populations than say for example nmbs - c7447 . with",
    "the ca h&k lines masked out due to atmospheric absorption , na d is one of the strongest lines in the spectrum , and its exclusion could explain the sudden change in the measured dispersion .",
    "to summarize , for most galaxies we find only a mild dependence on the wavelength range that is used in the fit .",
    "we do find that with decreasing wavelength range , the random error increases .",
    "finally , even in the absence of strong absorption features like ca h&k , we find similar velocity dispersions as compared to the full range fit .",
    "due to template mismatch , we only fit @xmath246 in our final results , as is explained in the next section .",
    "next , we study how different templates may influence the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "we use a sample of bc03 @xmath74-models , as presented in section [ subsec : sps ] .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the effect of template age and metallicity . in figure",
    "[ fig : disp_chi ] we show the reduced @xmath247 from the sps - modeling , vs. the velocity dispersions measured using this template .",
    "the different points represent different ages of the templates , with the minimum @xmath247 corresponding to the best - fit age as listed in table [ tab : stellar_prop ] .",
    "the different colors indicate the different metallicities .",
    "we show the @xmath247 from the sps - modeling instead of the @xmath247 from the dispersion fit , as the former is derived from the full visual and nir spectrum plus all the broadband and medium - band photometric data .",
    "this large wavelength range yields better constraints for the stellar population , thus larger relative ranges in @xmath247 as compared to the @xmath247 from the dispersion fit . also , as we add high - order additive polynomials to the templates from fitting the velocity dispersion ( in this case one order per 6000 kms@xmath6 ) , the effect of different template - ages is mostly washed out , and we get a small relative @xmath247 .    in figure [",
    "fig : disp_chi ] we see that for most galaxies the velocity dispersion for templates allowed within @xmath248 gives consistent results .",
    "different metallicities do give different velocity dispersions at their minimum @xmath247 , but this is a mere reflection of the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "different metallicities have different best - fitting ages , which in turn give different velocity dispersion . at a @xmath112 level",
    ", we only have a handful of best - fitting templates , for which we obtain similar velocity dispersions .",
    "uds-19627 is the exception , which shows a large dependency of the measured velocity dispersion as a function of template age within the @xmath112 allowed range . at the @xmath112 level",
    ", we find a range of @xmath249kms@xmath6 , due to template uncertainty , while the random error is one of the lowest , only @xmath250kms@xmath6 .",
    "even though templates with @xmath247 of 1.20 or higher are statistically considered a bad fit , the large range in the velocity dispersion is worrying .",
    "if we could not have constrained the best - fitting template from the full range spectrum and broadband data , the measured velocity dispersion would be highly uncertain .",
    "however , if we exclude the balmer break from the velocity dispersion fit , the dependency on template age almost completely disappears ( figure [ fig : disp_chi_gt4020 ] ) .",
    "uds-19627 shows the most dramatic change , where we suddenly see a tight range of best - fitting velocity dispersions .",
    "we do note that the velocity dispersion has increased , as was already shown in figure [ fig : wlrange ] .",
    "uds-29410 appears to have a slightly higher template uncertainty if we only fit for @xmath251 , but this is driven by the lower s / n of the spectrum as we now use a shorter wavelength range .    to conclude",
    ", we find a systematic uncertainty due to templates with different ages .",
    "this is caused by the balmer break , present in the relatively young galaxies in our sample . by only fitting for @xmath252 , the uncertainty due to template mismatch almost completely disappears . in that case , templates with different metallicities do give different velocity dispersions , but this is most likely caused by the underlying age - metallicity degeneracy .      in order to correct for stellar continuum emission differences between the observed galaxy spectrum and the template",
    ", we use an additive legendre polynomial .",
    "if we would not apply such a correction , the fitting routine could try to correct for this discrepancy by changing the velocity dispersion .",
    "values that are typically used in the literature vary from 5000 to 15000 kms@xmath6 per order .",
    "we do not use multiplicative legendre polynomials , because the s / n of the spectra are too low , and it would add another degree of uncertainty to the fit . here , we test the influence of the additive polynomial to our measured velocity dispersions .",
    "again we use the best - fit @xmath74-model as a template while varying the additive polynomials from 0 to 50 .",
    "we fit both the full - wavelength range and the wavelength range with @xmath251 .",
    "figure [ fig : polycheck ] shows the results , with the blue line representing the full - wavelength fit , while the red line shows the results for @xmath251 .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the polynomial with one order per 10000 kms@xmath6 .",
    "overall we find that by increasing the additive polynomial , the measured velocity dispersion increases .",
    "in general we find that between polynomials of 10 and 30 , the smallest increase in the velocity dispersion occurs , and this appears to be the most stable region .",
    "for this reason , we use one order per 10000 kms@xmath6 for our science results .",
    "while it is clear that a decrease in the s / n of the spectra will increase the random errors on the velocity dispersion , it could also cause systematic offsets ( e.g.,see @xcite ) .",
    "a concern would be that low s / n would lead to an overestimate of the velocity dispersions .",
    "therefore , in this section we test if there are systematic effects when changing the s / n for each source .",
    "the s / n we refer to in this section is derived in the region in which we also fit the velocity dispersion , i.e.,@xmath253 < 7000 $ ] .    for each source",
    ", we calculated the effect of s / n in a similar fashion as we derived the uncertainty on the velocity dispersion in section [ subsec : dispersions ] .",
    "first , we subtracted the best - fit model from the spectrum .",
    "this residual now corresponds to the noise for this particular s / n of this source .",
    "we multiply this residual by a certain factor to obtain a new ( higher or lower ) s / n as compared to our reference s /",
    "n . these residuals are then randomly rearranged in wavelength space and added to the best - fit template that has been convolved to a velocity dispersion of 300 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we then determined the velocity dispersion of simulated spectra with this s / n , and repeat this shuffling 100 times .",
    "lastly , we repeat this procedure for a large range in s / n from 0.1 to 100 @xmath254 .",
    "we note that uncertainties due to template mismatch are not included in this analysis .    in figure",
    "[ fig : disp_sn ] we show the results , with the different values of the s / n on the horizontal axis .",
    "we see that increasing the s / n will also decrease the random error in the velocity dispersions . on average",
    ", we find that in order to reach a uncertainty of less than @xmath255 on the velocity dispersion measurement , you need an s / n of 8@xmath254 or higher .",
    "nmbs - cos 7865 shows the lowest random error at fixed s / n , which is older stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "no systematic offset in the velocity dispersion is found for an s /",
    "n of @xmath256 .",
    "below this value , however , we find that the velocity dispersion is systematically underestimated as the s / n decreases , though the offset is still smaller than the random errors .",
    "we note that @xcite already presented simple arguments for predicting the systematic error .",
    "they show that the systematic offset of the velocity dispersion can be derived from error in the measured velocity , and goes as @xmath257 .",
    "we verified from these simulations that this is indeed the case . from this analytic approximation , we furthermore conclude that the systematic uncertainties of our measured velocity dispersion are small .      here",
    ", we test how our velocity dispersions would change if we make different choices for the sps - model , and test the difference between a single @xmath74-model and a template constructed from different combinations of singe stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "the left and middle panel of figure [ fig : disp_comp ] show what would happen if we would choose the flexible - sps models by @xcite ( @xcite , co09 ) or the models by @xcite ( @xcite , ma11 ) .",
    "these models are based on a different stellar library with slightly higher resolution as compared to bc03 , i.e.,miles @xcite vs. stelib @xcite .",
    "if a systematic uncertainty in the measured velocity dispersion is present , for example due to the resolution or details that go into the sps - models , it would show up in this comparison .",
    "we determined a best - fit @xmath74 model using the co09 and ma11 models in exactly the same way as was done for the bc03 models ( see section [ subsec : sps ] ) .",
    "when comparing the velocity dispersions derived by using the bc03 and co09 @xmath74-models , we do not find any significant difference ( left panel of figure [ fig : disp_comp ] ) .",
    "in the middle panel we compare ma11 and bc03 . here too , we find a good correspondence .",
    "for uds19627 the ma11 models give a lower velocity dispersion , though still within the @xmath112 error .",
    "these results confirm that our measurements are stable against the choice of sps - model and template with different resolution .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : disp_comp ] ( right panel ) we compare the velocity dispersion from the best - fit @xmath74-model , vs. an optimal template constructed by ppxf .",
    "this optimal template is built from a full spectral library from bc03 ssp models , with full range in age and metallicity .",
    "we note that the optimal template construction only uses the wavelength regime provided in the dispersion fit ( @xmath258 ) , and does not take into account the effects of dust .",
    "the velocity dispersions from the optimal templates are slightly higher as compared to the single @xmath74-model , although it is well below the random error .",
    "interestingly , the galaxy with the largest dust - contribution , nmbs - c18265 , also shows the largest difference between the two different fitting techniques . in this paper",
    ", we choose to use the best - fitting @xmath259 as the dispersion template , as this is the best representation of the stellar population . as the stellar mass",
    "is also based on this @xmath74-model , we use the same stellar population when comparing the stellar to the dynamical mass .",
    "here , we investigate the effects of different apertures and extraction methods on the observed velocity dispersion . the standard approach is to use a power - law to scale the observed velocity dispersion , measured within a certain @xmath260 , to the velocity dispersion as if measured within @xmath261 , using the following expression by @xcite :      or using a more recent result from the sauron survey @xcite : @xmath263 in the case of @xcite , the velocity dispersions have been measured in the range of @xmath264 , and for @xcite for @xmath265 . in this work",
    "however , we are outside this range with @xmath266 , that is @xmath267 being much smaller than @xmath268 . also , the galaxies in our sample have effective radii much smaller than the fwhm of the psf , which is why the standard approach most likely will not be valid .",
    "we analyze this problem in two steps .",
    "firstly , we use an analytic description for the kinematic profile and match this to the observed relation as found by @xcite . secondly",
    ", using our model we study the behavior of the observed velocity dispersion for different apertures ( both circular and non - circular ) and different fwhm for the psf .",

    "is given by ( see e.g. , @xcite;@xcite ) : @xmath269 with @xmath270 .",

    "figure [ fig : find_power ] shows the @xcite relation ( dashed black line ) and our model with different values for @xmath278 , normalized to @xmath97 ( red lines ) .",
    "we find a best fitting value for @xmath279 in the region of ( @xmath280 .",
    "notice that for @xmath281 our model deviates from the simple power law in equation [ eq : sigma_profile ] .",
    "now that we have found the intrinsic kinematic profile , we can explore the influence of the psf on the observed dispersion .",
    "the psf is modeled using a combination of two gaussians , where @xmath282 , and both gaussians having equal flux .",

    "this is also particularly clear from figure [ fig : psf_effect_circ_aper]b where we see that very little changes for @xmath285 as compared to the reference model .    instead of using a circular aperture ,",
    "we now consider the case of a rectangular aperture , similar to what is used in the spectra from x - shooter .",
    "equation [ eq : sigma_aper_sum_psf ] can be modified to include a weight function @xmath286 which is commonly used in optimized extraction .",
