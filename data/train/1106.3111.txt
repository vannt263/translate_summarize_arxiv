    "a vast majority of the extragalactic objects observed by the large area telescope ( lat ) on the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope can be classified as blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a unique subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) for which the jet is aligned with the observer s line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "analyses of the gamma - ray spectra of blazars along with other signatures of agns indicate that the gamma - ray emission is an essential observational tool for understanding of the physics of the central engines of agns .",
    "in addition , as in all agns , the distribution of spectral and other characteristics of blazars , and the correlations among these characteristics and their cosmological evolutions , are essential information for the studies of the formation and growth of central black holes of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this information comes from the investigation of the population as a whole .",
    "the process for any extragalactic source starts with the determination of the log@xmath4log@xmath1 relation which can be carried out simply by counting sources even before any redshifts are measured and distances are used to determine intrinsic characteristics such as luminosities and source densities ( and their evolution ) .",
    "although redshifts are measured for many blazars the extant sample is not yet sufficiently large to allow an accurate determination of the intrinsic characteristics .",
    "our ultimate goal is to carry out such an analysis but the focus of this paper is the determination of the flux and photon spectral index distributions .    the detection threshold flux of blazars by the",
    "_ fermi_-lat depends strongly on an object s gamma - ray spectrum , such that harder spectra are detected at lower fluxes ( measured for a given photon energy , here for photons @xmath5 mev ) .",
    "this means that for determination of the flux distribution we need both a measure of flux and the photon index @xmath6 , and that one deals with a bi - variate distribution of fluxes and indexes , which is truncated because of the above mentioned observational bias .",
    "thus a bias free determination of the distributions is more complicated than just counting sources .",
    "there have been analyses of this data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using monte carlo simulations to account for the detection biases . in this paper",
    "we use non - parametric methods to determine the distributions directly from the data at hand .",
    "as stressed by petrosian ( 1992 ) , when dealing with a bi-(or more generally multi)-variate distribution , the first required step is the determination of the correlation ( or statistical dependence ) between the variables , which can not be done by simple procedures when the data is truncated .",
    "we use the techniques developed by efron and petrosian ( ep , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which can account reliably for the complex observational selection biases to determine first the intrinsic correlations ( if any ) between the variables and then the mono - variate distribution of each variable .",
    "these techniques have been proven useful for application to many sources with varied characteristics and most recently to radio and optical luminosity in quasars in @xcite , where a more thorough discussion and references to earlier works are presented .",
    "in this paper we apply these methods to determine the correlation and the intrinsic distributions of flux and photon index of _ fermi_-lat blazars . in  [ datasec ] we discuss the data used from the lat extragalactic catalog , and in  [ dandr ] we explain the techniques used and present the results . in  [ bgndradsec ] we describe how the result from such studies are important for understanding the origin of the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) radiation .",

    "however , most of this correlation is due to the data truncation described above . ] thus , the first task is to establish whether the variables are independent . determining the correlation when the data is truncated is not straight forward .",
    "we use the efron - petrosian method to determine whether the two variables are correlated .",
    "this method is a version of the kendall tau statistic test devised for truncated data and uses the test statistic    @xmath33    to test the independence of two variables in a data set , say ( @xmath34 ) for @xmath35 . for untruncated data ( i.e. data truncated parallel to the axes",

    "the errors reported include statistical uncertainties in the fits and the deviations resulting from the 1@xmath26 range of the correlation parameter @xmath27 . a higher value of @xmath27 ( i.e. more positive correlation between flux and photon index absolute value ) moves the mean of the photon index distribution down to a lower absolute value of the photon index and makes the faint end source counts slope less steep ( less negative @xmath80 ) , while a lower value of @xmath27 has the opposite effect .",
    "it addition to uncertainty in the value of @xmath27 and those due to the fitting procedure there are other effects that can add to the uncertainties of the final results . here",
    "we consider the effects of some factors which we have ignored in the above analysis .",
    "_ individual measurement uncertainties _ :",
    "we have treated individual sources as points having a delta function distribution in the flux - index plane , resulting in a possible eddington bias @xcite .",
    "the measurement uncertainties can be included by changing the delta functions to kernels whose widths are determined by the reported measurement errors .",
    "the main effect of this will be smearing out of the distribution which can be neglected if the errors are small compared to the width of features in the distributions .",
    "this effect will not introduce any bias as long as measurement uncertainties are symmetrical about the reported value ( e.g the kernels are gaussian ) and the distributions themselves are symmetrical or fairly flat .",
    "the former is the case for the reported uncertainties in @xcite .",
    "this later is the case for the distribution of @xmath6 , where the reported measurement errors vary between 0.04 and 0.35 , but this is not likely to introduce any bias given the symmetrical distribution in @xmath6 .",
    "the situation is different for the flux distribution , which is a power law . in this case",
    "the typical flux uncertainty values are on the order of 1/4 - 1/3 of the reported fluxes .",
    "there may be more or fewer sources be included than missed in a flux limited sample such as this one .",
    "for example , for a power law differential distribution with index @xmath99 , which is the case here , more sources will be included than missed at any flux for which there are errors in the reported fluxes , which will bias the distribution .",
    "the effect is different for the case where fractional measurement errors are constant with flux versus when they change with flux . for constant fractional flux measurement errors",
    ", an error will be introduced on the normalization of the source counts and can be approximated by [ @xmath100 @xcite where @xmath101 is the fractional error in flux . for @xmath102 and @xmath103 this error will be about 5% , which is small compared with other sources of normalization uncertainty . on the other hand , there will be an effect on the reconstructed slope of the counts only if the fractional flux measurement errors change with flux .",
    "it is expected that the fractional flux errors will be larger for lower fluxes , and in the extreme case that they do increase from negligible at high fluxes to values of 1/4 - 1/3 at the lowest fluxes , according to simulation results in @xcite resulting fractional errors in the source count slope will be around 7% , which is significantly smaller than the errors we already quote for the source count slopes .",
    "@xcite evaluated the effect of measurements error on ep method determinations of luminosity functions of quasars using a gaussian kernel and found that for individual uncertainty widths significantly smaller than the data range , the effects of the inclusion of measurement uncertainties were small ( e.g. figure 1 of that work ) .",
    "given the gaussian symmetrical nature of the reported uncertainties , the symmetrical nature of the photon index distribution , and the relatively shallow faint end power law slope of the source counts distribution , and especially the relative size of the reported uncertainties compared to the range of values considered , in light of the analysis done by caditz and petrosian we consider the errors introduced by the individual data point uncertainties to be negligible compared to the uncertainties introduced by the range of the correlation parameter @xmath27 and the uncertainties in the power - law fits .",
    "_ blazar variability _ : it is well known that blazars are inherently variable objects .",
    "there are two potential effects arising from blazar variability relevant to the analysis here .",
    "one is similar to measurement error discussed above , in that it presumably would cause more objects to rise above the flux limit and be included in the survey than go below the flux limit and be excluded .",
    "the other is that the reported temporally averaged quantities such as flux and photon index , which we use in this analysis , may deviate from the true average values .    addressing the former issue , as discussed in the first year _",
    "fermi_-lat extragalactic source catalog ( e.g. figure 11c of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the pattern of maximum flux versus mean flux does deviate at the lowest detected fluxes .",
    "this indicates that variability becomes more important with decreasing flux , but not as sharply as might be expected from previous egret data",
    ". this will be even less sharp for the @xmath11 sources we use as opposed to the entire @xmath104 sample considered there .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the peak - to - mean flux ratio is a factor of two or less for most",
    "_ fermi_-lat blazars , which excludes the possibility that most of the sources are detected because of a single outburst which happened during the 11 months of observation and are undetected for the remaining time .",
    "we believe the bias resulting from detecting blazars only in their flaring state is small .    addressing the later issue",
    ", both @xcite and @xcite presented a detailed analysis of the variability issues with _ fermi - lat _ blazars .",
    "they find that most sources exceed their average flux for less than 20% , and often less than 5% , of the monitored time , and conclude that both the timescale of variability is short compared with the length of observations , and that the measured average quantities are not highly biased by flaring .",
    "moreover , as also shown in @xcite , there is little or no temporal variation of the photon index with flux .",
    "we thus believe that no large systematic uncertainties result from the use of these averaged physical quantities .. ]    \\3 .",
    "_ source confusion _",
    ": source confusion can also introduce errors at the faint end of the reconstructed distributions because of relatively broad point spread function of the _ fermi_-lat ; some faint sources may be either missed entirely or erroneously combined into the fluxes of other sources .",
    "we first note that these two phenomena will have opposite systematic effects on the faint end source counts slope , as the former would tend to make it less steep while the later would tend to make it steeper .",
    "in addition to this self - canceling tendency , several tests argue against _",
    "fermi_-lat s blazar detections being significantly confusion limited .",
    "@xcite estimates that at galactic latitudes above @xmath105 and at a @xmath104 detection threshold , approximately 7.6% of sources ( 80 out of 1043 ) are missed because of confusion , and blazars are 85% of the @xmath106 sources .",
    "since we have used only sources detected at @xmath107 and at latitudes above @xmath108 galactic latitude , the effect of confusion should be lower because the sample will be more complete .",

    "we also note that to the extent that the _ effects _ of both blazar variability and source confusion will have some photon index dependence , because of differing spectra in the case of the former and the _",
    "fermi_-lat s energy - dependent point spread function in the case of the later , then any potential biases will already have been accounted for in the way we have dealt with truncations in the @xmath111 plane .",
    "we have treated the truncation in that plane as empirical and accounted for it as discussed in  [ corrs ] .    in summary ,",
    "most of these additional sources of error are small and are important only for a small range of fluxes around the lowest fluxes , where the ep method has a larger uncertainty anyway , and for that reason these low fluxes are excluded from the fitting in our analysis ( compare the end points of raw and corrected distributions in figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "we can use the above results to calculate the total flux from blazars and the contribution of blazars to the egb , defined here as the total extragalactic gamma - ray photon output .",
    "the total output in gamma - ray photons from blazar sources with fluxes greater than a given @xmath17 , in terms of photons s@xmath10 @xmath9 sr@xmath10 between 0.1 to 100 gev , is    @xmath112    integrating by parts the contribution to the egb can be related directly to the cumulative distribution @xmath77 which is the primary output of our procedure @xmath113 the advantage of using the latter equation is that it can give a step - by - step cumulative total contribution to the background instead of using analytic fits to the differential or cumulative distributions obtained from binning the data .",

    "we have used a rigorous method to calculate the intrinsic distributions in flux ( known commonly as the source counts or the log@xmath0-log@xmath1 relation ) and photon index of _",

    ". however the _",
    "fermi_-lat bandwidth is sufficiently large that the contribution of sources which peak outside of this range to the source counts and the egb in this energy range will be small .",
    "we find that the photon index and flux show a slight correlation , although this correlation is of marginal significance .",
    "this indicates that the intrinsic luminosities and photon indexes are correlated only weakly .",
    "the comparison of the intrinsic and raw observed distributions show clearly the substantial effects of the observational bias .",
    "the intrinsic differential counts can be fitted adequately by a broken power law and the photon index appears to have a intrinsic gaussian distribution .",
    "we also find that in general the values reported here are consistent with those reported in ma for the power law slopes of the flux distribution @xmath31 and the distributions of photon index @xmath32 , although the allowed range of the correlation parameter @xmath27 here allows for wider uncertainty in these values in some cases .",
    "we do note a discrepancy at the 1@xmath26 level for the faint end slope of the fsrq source counts .    using the bias free distributions we calculated the total cumulative contribution of blazars to the egb as a function of flux . we obtain this directly from the cumulative flux distribution which is the main output of the methods used . under the assumption that the distribution of blazars continues to arbitrarily low flux , we find the best fit contribution of blazars to the total extragalactic gamma - ray radiation in the range from 0.1 to 100 gev to be at the level of 59% , although this analysis can not rule out blazars producing as little as 39% or as much as all of the total extragalactic gamma - ray output .",
    "this result is in agreement with the result in ma , although with a larger uncertainty .",
    "the significant uncertainties reported here for the source count slopes and the contribution of blazars to the egb are ultimately due to the allowed range of the correlation parameter @xmath27 .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , the method applied to the ( uncorrelated ) simulated data also manifests a significant uncertainty on @xmath27 , that translates into the corresponding uncertainty for the faint - end slope of the source count distribution .",
    "this is important as it ultimately governs the contribution of blazars to the egb .",
    "we note that a similar scenario ( i.e. absence of a correlation between photon index and flux ) might characterize the real data in view of the results reported in the previous sections and their similarity to the results obtained using simulated uncorrelated data .",
    "as shown in the appendix , larger samples are required to narrow down the uncertainty on the correlation parameter @xmath27 .",
    "if , as could be expected , the flux distribution flattens at fluxes below @xmath12410@xmath126 photons @xmath9 sec@xmath10 , the integrated contribution will be significantly lower than for a naive extrapolation to zero flux .",
    "this is also modulo any change in the power law slope of the source counts below the fluxes probed in this analysis , which might arise due to luminosity and/or density evolution with redshift .",
    "a full accounting for the possible evolution in the blazar population using a sample with redshift determinations will be presented in a forthcoming work .",
