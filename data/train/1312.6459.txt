    "[ fig : rs ] and [ fig : xs ] .",

    "these microwave modes are best pictured as standing waves of a cylindrical waveguide , with the mode number @xmath28 giving the number of half wavelengths along the @xmath29-direction . by working with @xmath30 and @xmath31 families of resonant modes ,",
    "we guarantee that the of microwave magnetic field has a local maximum at the centre of the resonator , at which @xmath32 points along the cylinder axis .",
    "the rest of the frequency variation is obtained by scanning the radial mode number @xmath33 .",
    "resonator temperature is kept fixed at @xmath34  k during the measurements .",
    "the platelet tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath1  sample was mounted at the end of a high - purity silicon hot - finger using vacuum grease , and then introduced into the resonator through a hole bored along the axis of the rutile cylinder .",
    "all data sets were taken with @xmath32 oriented parallel to the crystal @xmath24-axis , to induce in - plane screening currents .",
    "this leads to large demagnetizing effects in our geometry , so we were careful to keep microwave power levels low enough to remain in the linear - response regime . for separate reasons , we hold @xmath32 constant during temperature sweeps , to prevent small nonlinearities associated with the rutile resonator from contributing to the apparent temperature dependence of the sample s surface impedance",
    "this is in keeping with the golden rule of precision cavity perturbation measurement : to vary one , and only one , property of the resonant system at a time .",
    "the microwave resonator system was mounted in an oxford instruments mx40 dilution refrigerator , as shown in ref .",
    ", with the hot - finger technique allowing the temperature of the sample to be varied between 0.12 and 30  k while the resonator was kept at a fixed temperature of 1.5  k. as a hot - finger material , silicon has advantages over sapphire for low - temperature work : signal contamination from paramagnetic effects is negligible , in contrast to prominent curie - like behaviour in sapphire below 1  k. there is a trade - off at high temperatures , however : thermal excitation of free carriers in the silicon became observable above 28  k , imposing a practical upper bound on the temperature range of the experiment .",
    "the temperature dependence of the surface impedance was inferred using the cavity perturbation relation@xcite @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the resonant bandwidth of the te@xmath26 mode of interest , @xmath37 is the corresponding resonant frequency , and temperature - dependent changes are with respect to the values of the variables at a reference temperature , @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is an empirically determined scale factor , different for each mode .",
    "the resonator technique is accurate and fast , allowing measurements to be made in sequence at the 17 different frequencies but , on its own , does not always allow the absolute magnitude of @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be reliably determined . in some cases , for lower - order microwave modes , a reasonably accurate measurement of absolute surface resistance can be made by subtracting the empty - resonator @xmath36 from the value with the sample in place .",
    "however , experience has shown that this technique breaks down for the higher - order microwave modes . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we have developed a bolometric technique that infers the absolute surface resistance from the temperature rise of the sample in the presence of a microwave magnetic field of known intensity , in a similar spirit to ref .  .",
    "the bolometric measurement is slow compared to a cavity perturbation measurement , but only needs to be carried out once for each frequency .",
    "the absolute surface reactance is obtained using an technique to determine the zero - temperature penetration depth , @xmath42 .",
    "that is , we find the temperature - independent offset , @xmath43 , which , when added to @xmath44 , imposes the hagen ",
    "rubens criterion that @xmath40 and @xmath41 be equal in the normal state.@xcite the in - plane normal - state resistivity , @xmath45 cm , obtained in a separate measurement on the same sample , was used to determine the resonator constant @xmath39 at each frequency by imposing a normalization condition on the real part of the microwave conductivity : @xmath46 .",
    "inaccuracy in the determination of the dc resistivity is the principal source of uncertainty in our measurement , and acts as a scale error for the overall data set .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in resistivity to be 10% , leading to 5% errors in surface impedance and penetration depth ; and 10% errors in conductivity and superfluid density .    with a thickness of 11  @xmath11 m ,",

    "our crystal is never very far into the finite - size limit , at any temperature or frequency , so the corrections are weak and all conditions are satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , we have carried out this correction on all the data .",
    "this is important because the normal - state surface impedance is used both for calibration purposes and for the determination of @xmath42 .",

    "surface resistance decreases monotonically with temperature .",
    "several weak , broad features are visible in the @xmath54 traces  these appear more prominently in the real part of the microwave conductivity . at low temperatures ,",
    "there is substantial residual surface resistance .",

    "[ sec : surface_impedance ] , temperature - dependent changes in surface reactance have been obtained by measuring the frequency shift of the dielectric resonator in the 17 te@xmath26 resonant modes used in this experiment .",
    "the most prominent feature in the temperature dependence of @xmath41 is a small peak in @xmath59 immediately below @xmath10 .",
    "this is due to the onset of a kinetic - inductance contribution to the reactance , and is often observed at the superconducting transition .",
    "the absolute surface reactance has been obtained using the normal - state surface - impedance matching technique .",

    "the real part of the microwave conductivity , @xmath68 , is plotted in fig .  [ fig : sigma1 ] for the 17 frequencies .",
    "the measured @xmath68 traces evolve smoothly with frequency , giving us confidence in the use of the higher order te@xmath26 modes for microwave spectroscopy .",
    "the general behaviour is qualitatively similar at all frequencies : on cooling through @xmath10 , there is an initial rise in @xmath68 , followed by a peak in the range of 15 to 16  k and then a monotonic decrease to low temperatures .",
    "below 3  k , @xmath68 follows a quadratic temperature dependence .",

    "inelastic scattering _ ; @xmath68 peaks where the quasiparticle relaxation rate reaches an elastic disorder limit ; and then @xmath68 decreases at lower temperatures as the remaining quasiparticles condense .",
    "the situation in overdoped tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , although superficially similar , emerges as being quite different on closer inspection . to begin with , the normal - state scattering is predominantly elastic ( disorder limited ) by the time material reaches @xmath10 : there may be some additional decrease in quasiparticle scattering on entering the superconducting state , but this is more likely a result of reduced phase space for recoil than a collapse in inelastic scattering .",
    "further clues as to the nature of the charge dynamics come from examining the conductivity spectrum , @xmath72 , which we are able to plot in detail using the multiple - frequency resonator data .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . at most temperatures ,",
    "the @xmath72 spectra show strong frequency dependence in the microwave range  this is a clear indication of long - lived charge excitations , relaxing on timescales of the order of 40  picoseconds .",
    "however , for the lowest temperatures , we see that the frequency dependence of @xmath73 is quite weak  this is something of a paradox , since the quasiparticle relaxation rate should be lowest at low @xmath74 .",
    "this raises the question as to what is responsible for the strong variation of @xmath75 in the microwave range  our best hypothesis is that we are observing charge transport by short - lived superconducting currents , resulting from a combination of intrinsic dynamical inhomogeneities due to fluctuations , and static inhomogeneities arising from a spatial variation of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , the microwave frequency scale , @xmath76 , allows us to estimate the length scale over which these fluctuations occur : the fluctuation lifetime is @xmath77 ; the fluctuation length scale should be @xmath78 .",
    "using a fermi velocity @xmath79  m / s ( ref .  ) , a fluctuation frequency scale of 4  ghz corresponds to a length scale of 7  @xmath11 m .",
    "this is far too long to be the quasiparticle mean free path , but it is quite feasible that superconducting inhomogeneities ( dynamic or static ) occur on this scale . while this points to an increased role for inhomogeneities in overdoped tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath1  compared to optimally doped cuprates , as has been suggested in the context of superfluid density suppression,@xcite it is important to note that the narrow peaks in @xmath75 contain a negligible fraction of the total conductivity spectral weight  we will later make an estimate , based on a spectral weight argument , that places the actual quasiparticle scattering rate in the range of 500  ghz .",
    "the frequency - dependent superfluid density , @xmath80 , is obtained from the imaginary part of the microwave conductivity according to : @xmath81 superfluid density is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhos ] for the 17 frequencies .",
    "the most striking feature is the strong linear temperature dependence extending from 2 to 14  k. while @xmath82 is the hallmark of line nodes in the energy gap , the observed behaviour extends over a wider range than expected .",
    "a similarly strong temperature dependence is seen in near - optimally doped tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath1,@xcite and underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath20o@xmath83,@xcite but not in optimally doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath20o@xmath71 , @xcite or bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath84.@xcite in overdoped tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath1  at higher temperatures , @xmath85 has upward curvature : the behaviour in the vicinity of 20  k is almost certainly not intrinsic and , as with the rounding of @xmath54 , is likely associated with spatial variation of @xmath10  due to chemical inhomogeneity .",
    "in fact , the @xmath85 data allow us to place experimental bounds on the variation of @xmath10 in the sample , confining it to the range 20  to  25  k. this is at odds with the model of microscopic inhomogeneities@xcite put forward to explain the anomalous behaviour of the resistive critical field,@xcite and it would therefore be very interesting to repeat the magnetotransport measurements on a similar sample to that measured here , to see if improvement in the homogeneity of dopant oxygen atoms has changed the form of @xmath9 . returning to the superfluid density data ,",
    "the frequency variation of @xmath80 is also substantial in the vicinity of the superconducting transition , and this is in keeping with the strong frequency variation of @xmath73 at similar temperatures : the microwave conductivity is a causal response function , and its real and imaginary parts must be related by kramers ",
