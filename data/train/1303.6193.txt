    "in a previous work @xcite ( henceforth cited as [ l1 ] ) we developed a lagrangian theory for the evolution of structure in irrotational dust continua in the framework of general relativity .",
    "this theory is characterized by employing as a single dynamical variable the set of spatial coframes @xmath4 , in the comoving ",
    "synchronous metric form : @xmath5 with the spatial metric coefficients @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are gaussian normal ( lagrangian ) coordinates that are constant along flow lines ( here geodesics ) ; @xmath8 denote coordinate indices , while @xmath9 are just counters . having written einstein s equations in terms of the variable @xmath4 , we are entitled to set up a perturbation scheme that only perturbs this variable , while other variables like the density , the metric or the curvature , are expressed as functionals of this perturbation .",
    "such a point of view extrapolates these latter physical quantities beyond a strict perturbative expansion . in this spirit we defined and evaluated the first ",
    "order perturbation scheme on a flrw background cosmology as a clear  cut definition of what has been known as the \" relativistic zeldovich approximation  ( henceforth abbreviated by rza ) in previous work ( see @xcite and references on previous work therein , in particular ) .    in the present work we will model the fluctuations using this approximation and combine the resulting backreaction model with exact average properties of inhomogeneous dust cosmologies .",
    "( this framework is reviewed in @xcite and @xcite and will be briefly recalled below . )",
    "we will so paraphrase a detailed investigation in newtonian cosmology @xcite ( henceforth cited as [ bks ] ) , where we presented the results of an in  depth quantitative study of the _ kinematical backreaction effect _ in newtonian cosmology @xcite . in order to evaluate the influence of inhomogeneities on effective cosmological parameters we employed in @xcite exact solutions with planar and spherical symmetry , as well as perturbative solutions for generic initial conditions in the eulerian and lagrangian first  order perturbation schemes .",
    "the most general , nonperturbative model studied was based on the first ",
    "order lagrangian deformation that was used as input into the kinematical backreaction functional ( fluctuation model ) , but the effective cosmology ( the average ) was then evaluated within the framework of the exact averaged equations .",
    "we will here provide the corresponding model in general relativity .    in @xcite our initial data",
    "setting was conservative , i.e. we started with a standard _ cold dark matter _ power spectrum without a cosmological constant at the beginning of the matter  dominated era , maintaining the early universe description as in the standard model .",
    "perhaps the most surprising outcome of this study was that , although the kinematical backreaction term @xmath10 itself was quantitatively negligible on large expanding domains , the other cosmological parameters could still experience significant changes , e.g. for the deceleration parameter we found typical fluctuations up to @xmath11 percent on the scale of @xmath1  mpc ( with @xmath12 ) .",
    "in this work we will give the results for two background models : ( i ) a cdm spectrum with @xmath12 as in @xcite to allow for comparison , and ( ii ) a @xmath13cdm spectrum with @xmath14 to study the effect of the background .",
    "for the interpretation of the emerging curvature inhomogeneities as ` dark energy ' we refer to the first model .",
    "note that both homogeneous  isotropic models are assumed to have euclidean space sections .",
    "recall that , in newtonian cosmology , the kinematical backreaction vanishes by construction on the scale of an imposed torus architecture ( i.e. the use of periodic boundary conditions ) @xcite , a restriction that no longer applies to the general relativistic model .",
    "the present investigation thus offers a more general view on the backreaction model , notably by allowing for a nontrivial curvature evolution .",
    "we may approach the present work with the following guidelines :    * the _ cosmic triangle _ @xcite of the three parameters of the standard model ( related to the homogeneous density , the constant curvature and the cosmological constant ) _ fluctuates _ on a given spatial scale .",
    "the measure of deviations from the flrw time evolution of these parameters is a kinematical backreaction functional @xmath10 that encodes averaged fluctuations in kinematical invariants ( the rate of expansion and the rate of shear ) .",
    "* the influence of backreaction may be twofold : for dominating shear fluctuations the effective density decelerating the expansion is larger than the actual matter density , thus mimicking the effect of a _ kinematical dark matter _ ; for dominating expansion fluctuations backreaction acts accelerating , thus mimicking the effect of a ( positive ) cosmological constant , i.e. _ kinematical dark energy_. * in general relativity , backreaction entails an emerging intrinsic curvature .",
    "thus , as soon as we require , on some scale , that the average model is given by a standard flrw model geometry , then the emerging curvature term allows to interpret the above  mentioned kinematical effects as ` dark matter ' or ` dark energy ' , respectively . in newtonian cosmology , the backreaction term should be interpreted as cosmic variance of velocity fluctuations on a euclidean space ; a general  relativistic model entails deviations from a euclidean model geometry ; we so are led to interpret the dark sources in an assumed euclidean background as `` curvature energies '' of the actual average distribution . *",
    "a genuinely relativistic property is the coupling of the kinematical backreaction functional to the averaged scalar ( 3ricci ) curvature .",
    "this coupling is absent in weakly perturbed flrw spacetimes , e.g. in a newtonian framework where a fluctuating scalar curvature is absent , or in a post  newtonian framework and standard relativistic perturbation theory at first order , where the cosmological model is required to stay close to the constant  curvature flrw spacetime , if this latter is taken as the background spacetime . *",
    "if kinematical backreaction is positive , i.e. dominated by expansion fluctuations and by a negative averaged curvature , a small source term is capable of driving the averaged system away from the homogeneous ",
    "isotropic flrw background .",
    "we found , with the help of a detailed dynamical systems analysis of scaling solutions @xcite , generalizing a previous analysis @xcite , that the standard model is a _ repellor _ in this situation , and the physical background ( the average ) is no longer given by the flrw background .",
    "we may say that the physical background lies in the ` dark energy sector ' .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the case of shear  dominated evolution of small  scale domains with positive averaged curvature , where the average is driven to lie in the ` dark matter sector ' .",
    "this insight suggests , that a perturbation theory has to be set up on a background that interacts with structure formation ( a framework for such a perturbation theory has been suggested @xcite ) .",
    "this remark implies that the present investigation is limited , since we employ perturbations on a flrw background .",
    "the resulting backreaction model , however , can be formally employed also in such a more general framework , which is the subject of forthcoming work .",
    "we proceed as follows . in sect .",

    "this average coincides with the riemannian volume average , if we consider fields at initial time , @xmath44 ( therefore we label it by @xmath45 ) . rewriting the riemannian average in terms of this formal average operation",
    ", we obtain the useful formula : @xmath46 it will simplify the following calculations and is useful to discuss the newtonian limit ( see section  [ sect : newtonlimit ] ) .        the spatially averaged equations for the volume scale factor @xmath25 , respecting rest mass conservation within the domain @xmath21 , read @xcite : + _ averaged raychaudhuri equation _ : @xmath47 _ averaged hamilton constraint _",

    "the kinematical backreaction source term itself is given by : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the principal scalar invariants ( defined equivalently to eq .",
    "( [ eq : definv ] ) below ) of the extrinsic curvature coefficients @xmath54",
    ". the second equality follows by introducing the decomposition of the extrinsic curvature into the kinematical variables , by means of the identity @xmath55 .",

    "cosmology , the scalar curvature remains zero .",
    "this is not the case in the inhomogeneous gr context , where kinematical backreaction produces averaged curvature in the course of structure formation , even for domains that are on average flat initially .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonconstraint ] ) we obtain the _",
    "generalized friedmann equation _ : @xmath65 this equation is formally equivalent to its newtonian counterpart @xcite .",
    "it shows that , by eliminating the averaged curvature , the whole history of the averaged kinematical fluctuations acts as a source of a generalized friedmann equation .",
    "this equation was the starting point of our investigations in @xcite .",
    "since it is also valid in general relativity , we are in the position to translate many results from @xcite into the gr context .",
    "in particular , our numerical codes can be accordingly applied .",
    "we now provide a compact form of the averaged equations introduced above , as well as some derived quantities that we will analyze in this paper .",
    "the above equations can formally be recast into standard friedmann equations for an effective perfect fluid energy momentum tensor with new effective sources @xcite : @xmath66 @xmath67 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : effectivefriedmann ] ) correspond to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : expansion - law - gr ] ) , ( [ eq : hamiltonconstraint ] ) and ( [ eq : integrability - gr ] ) , respectively .    this system of equations does not close unless we impose a model for the inhomogeneities .",
    "note that , if the system would close , this would mean that we solved the scalar parts of the gr equations in general by reducing them to a set of ordinary differential equations on arbitrary scales @xmath21 .",
    "closure assumptions have been studied by prescribing a _ cosmic equation of state _ of the form @xmath68 @xcite , or by prescribing the backreaction terms through _ scaling solutions _ , e.g. @xmath69 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are going to explicitly model @xmath10 by a relativistic lagrangian perturbation scheme .",
    "for later convenience we introduce the set of dimensionless average characteristics : @xmath70 we will , henceforth , call these characteristics ` parameters ' , but the reader should keep in mind that these are functionals on @xmath21 .",

    "in the last section we saw how the appearance of the backreaction term modifies the standard friedmannian evolution . in the following",
    "we will quantify this departure .",
    "exact inhomogeneous solutions for estimating the amount of backreaction are only available for highly symmetric models like for models with plane symmetry ( subsect .",

    "as the newtonian result @xcite suggests , we will obtain also here an approximation that interpolates in special cases between the above two subclasses of exact gr solutions with orthogonal kinematical properties .",
    "however , the classes of solutions will be more strongly restricted than in the newtonian case , because of the hamilton constraint that joins the system of equations in the gr context .        to be able to use the",
    "` relativistic zeldovich approximation ' as formulated in @xcite , we will first express the kinematical backreaction term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - gr ] ) in terms of the spatial coframe coefficients @xmath77 .",
    "these latter are defined through the metric form coefficients @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the initial metric coefficients .",
    "the coframes therefore contain the complete time evolution of the metric .",
    "we now express the expansion tensor , @xmath80 with the help of the coframes .",

    "( notice that we have chosen the first option in @xcite . )      after the definition of the perturbative setup explained in the previous section , we now turn to the concrete calculation of the backreaction and curvature models .",

    "( [ resultq2 ] ) for the backreaction model has the correct newtonian limit .",
    "the procedure to arrive at the newtonian limit of the relativistic quantities follows the prescription of @xcite , that sends the nonintegrable cartan coframes to integrable ones : @xmath167 as was demonstrated in @xcite , this leads exactly to the newtonian system of fluid equations in the lagrangian description .",

    "note that the existence of a vector field @xmath172 implies that the counterindex @xmath173 becomes a coordinate index of ( now existing ) global coordinates in an embedding space .",
    "the riemannian volume average automatically corresponds to the euclidean volume average over a flat domain @xmath23 .",
    "( note that sending the speed of light to infinity is only needed in order to change the spacetime metric signature ; since the backreaction model is spatial , and since we have eliminated all terms that would contain the speed of light ( the curvature ) , we do not have to send @xmath174 to infinity . )",
    "taking the spatial geometrical limit is thus sufficient to reduce the result , eq .",
    "( [ resultq2 ] ) , to the newtonian expression : @xmath175 with : @xmath176      another consistency check considers the scalar curvature in the rza",

    "the first way is to use the rza metric and to calculate the curvature geometrically .",
    "the other two ways will be studied below ; both relate the scalar curvature to extrinsic curvature invariants ( note that these are relevant for this work , since we study kinematical backreaction being related to extrinsic curvature ) :    * using a combination of the hamilton constraint and the raychaudhuri equation , * using the integrability condition .",

    "is also reduced with respect to the background value and again we have curvature emerging from a flat background . today , however , it is not as big as in the eds case , since the cosmological constant dominates .    in both cases",
    "we see that , even though the backreaction contribution stays tiny ( as was already found in @xcite ) , we have a considerable amount of curvature . comparing this curvature contribution with the flat geometry of the background on a given scale",
    "allows its interpretation in terms of ` dark energy ' : the standard interpretation is that the matter distribution evolves on a flat geometry ; hence one would add a fundamental component to compensate the actually existing curvature that we model here .",
    "in other words , the matter distribution has to be seen on a curved space section and not on a flat background . taking this point of view , the emerging curvature quantifies , on a given scale , the amount of ` dark energy ' that would be needed to compensate it in a quasi ",
    "newtonian model .",
    "we find for the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : cospar100 ] that our model predicts the existence of typical domains with a diameter of @xmath1 mpc of about @xmath0 of the needed amount of ` dark energy ' .",
    "this amount can increase to @xmath321 , if the @xmath1 mpc domain is slightly untypical ( i.e. found with a two  sigma probability , fig .  [ fig : cospar100sig2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig : cospar50 ] , [ fig : cospar25 ] and [ fig : cospar25ratio ] show that the backreaction can have the opposite effect by looking at smaller scales .",
    "a typical , collapsing domain produces on average a positive curvature ( corresponding to a negative curvature density parameter ) . in light of the interpretation above",
    ", the collapse produces a large amount of ` dark matter ' in the form of positive curvature .",
    "while the ` cosmological parameters ' start to lose their sense on this scale , we can clearly see , e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig : cospar50 ] , that the curvature contribution is of the order of the density contribution , since it compensates the produced over  densities .",
    "the physical interpretation is also clear : over  densities are hosted in positive  curvature environments .",
    "the order of magnitude of ` dark matter ' is also comparable with that of ` dark energy ' in expanding domains , i.e. we can also here say that a substantial fraction of the density parameters is contained in the curvature parameter , while it is of comparable magnitude and not dominating .        given the conservative assumptions of our model these values point to a highly significant effect of backreaction .",
    "except in particular ltb models , where ` dark energy ' can be fully replaced , the only generic model that carries such a large effect has been investigated by enqvist _",
    "_ @xcite by employing gradient expansion techniques that allow to go substantially beyond standard ( eulerian ) perturbation methods @xcite .",
    "these latter have to assume a universe model that stays close to the assumed background . for comparison ,",
    "we wish to point the reader to a figure in @xcite : fig .",
    "[ fig : xmatscale ] corresponds to their fig .  4 and shows the scale dependence of the @xmath322matter component @xmath323 today : the @xmath322matter produces ` dark energy ' on expanding , underdense domains ( left panel ) , starts to compete with the matter density on scales below @xmath309 mpc and it is still significant ( @xmath2% ) on domains of @xmath3 mpc ; it produces ` dark matter ' on collapsing , overdense domains ( right panel ) , starts to compete with the matter density again below the scales of @xmath309 mpc , and shows similar significance as ` dark energy ' on domains with diameter @xmath3 mpc .",
    "note that the large  scale value is astonishingly big , since we are looking at a scale that is considered to comply with homogeneity .",
    "based on a nonlinear extrapolation of a first  order relativistic lagrangian perturbation scheme investigated in @xcite , we modeled the fluctuations in extrinsic curvature in the form of the kinematical backreaction term @xmath324 for the description of the average properties of irrotational dust models .",
    "we provided backreaction and intrinsic curvature expressions as nonlinear functionals of the first ",
    "order lagrangian deformation and used them as an input for the general framework for the average dynamics .",
    "the large  scale behavior of the backreaction variables , @xmath325 and @xmath326 , at second order is identical to the leading mode in the second  order perturbation theory ( proportional to @xmath166 for an eds background , while the leading curvature contribution is proportional to @xmath327 in conformity with the perturbative calculations of @xcite ) .",
    "we showed that the backreaction model contains in limiting cases the newtonian approximation investigated in @xcite , as well as special classes of exact gr solutions .",
    "we argued that this backreaction model is a powerful approximation due to the successes of the corresponding elements of this approximation in newtonian cosmology ( like the large  scale performance of the newtonian zeldovich approximation in comparison with n  body simulations , e.g. @xcite ) , and also due to the above  mentioned property of interpolating between exact gr solutions with orthogonal symmetries .",
    "we discussed how substantial results of @xcite can be translated to the relativistic context , the new feature being an emerging intrinsic averaged curvature .",
    "this translation is possible due to the fact that the lagrangian description offered in @xcite features a clear  cut newtonian limit by sending the coefficients of the coframes to their euclidean counterparts , @xmath328 , where the existence of the vector field @xmath172 in the newtonian case describes the embedding into a global euclidean vector space .",
    "the so  called _ electric part of the lagrange ",
    "einstein system _ @xcite is formally identical to the newtonian equations in lagrangian form , where in the gr case the nonintegrability of the coframes is responsible for the emerging curvature .",
    "we quantified the fluctuations of various cosmological parameters on different spatial domains for standard model backgrounds ( cdm and @xmath13cdm power spectrum ) , and we now focus on these quantitative results .      in order to discuss the quantitative results of our investigation ,",
    "let us concentrate on the averaged scalar curvature @xmath329 .",
    "the principal idea is to compare the energy balance conditions , encoded in cosmological parameters ( i ) in the standard model and ( ii ) in the averaged model .",
    "the balance condition for ( i ) is entirely defined through the chosen background cosmology and furnished by the normalized hamilton constraint .",
    "for the two chosen backgrounds we simply have @xmath330 where initially @xmath331 dominates and remains equal to @xmath299 for the eds background , while the importance of @xmath13 increases in the late stages in the background of the ` concordance model ' .",
    "this balance has to be compared with the ( scale dependent ) balance of the averaged cosmology furnished by the normalized averaged hamilton constraint , @xmath332 where @xmath333 comprises the emerging backreaction and curvature due to structure formation .",
    "this comparison allows us to interpret the @xmath322matter energy density content as a candidate , on some scale , for the contribution by @xmath334 that is added _",
    "ad hoc _ in the standard model .",
    "one subtlety of this interpretation is related to the scale dependence of the averaged balance condition and also to its evaluation on a chosen background cosmology that is already supposed to contain a substantial amount of ` dark matter ' ( for both backgrounds ) and , additionally , ` dark energy ' ( for the ` concordance model ' ) .",
    "we will now discuss the values obtained at the present day , and denote the domain by @xmath335 .",
    "we found , in accord with previous analyses that were e.g. summarized in the review papers @xcite , that on large underdense domains of the order of @xmath336 mpc , fluctuations feature a negative averaged curvature due to the fact that on these scales the universe model is void  dominated .",
    "note that the curvature does not individually obey a conservation law like the density ; only a combination of averaged curvature and backreaction is conserved @xcite .",
    "let us look , for example , at a scale of @xmath1 mpc . while the contribution by kinematical backreaction @xmath302 remains small in this situation , the curvature density parameter ( that is positive for negative curvature )",
    ", @xmath337 is , for one  sigma initial fluctuations , of the order of ( e.g. on the eds background ) @xmath315% and compensates the lowered matter density parameter on this scale , @xmath338 .",
    "this result , being physically plausible , nevertheless paints a completely different picture from the one advocated in standard cosmology , e.g. @xcite ( for a thorough treatment of the quality of quasi  newtonian approximations see @xcite ) , claiming that intrinsic curvature is irrelevant down to the scales of neutron stars ( see discussions and estimates in @xcite ) . since this latter prejudice led to the inclusion of a large amount of ` dark energy ' into the background , as modeled by a cosmological constant in the @xmath13cdm model , we are entitled to take the eds background without ` dark energy ' and interpret the negative averaged curvature contribution as a replacement of the ` dark energy ' in the standard interpretation , where curvature is strictly zero on all scales",
    ". we have quantified this contribution as less than @xmath315% for one  sigma fluctuations on @xmath1 mpc , which is  in this model  not enough to compensate the missing ` dark energy ' of the order of @xmath339% .",
    "( note that when speaking about ` dark energy ' we do not imply that the @xmath322matter component always produces an accelerating universe model . ) for two  sigma fluctuations on this scale we find @xmath340% of the needed amount , but due to the architecture of our model , as discussed below , this contribution falls off rapidly on very large scales .",
    "we may compare this regional behavior in the sense of so  called ` void models ' that assume we are living in a large underdense region , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . in the spirit of these models our generic model ` explains away ' @xmath341 of the ` dark energy ' for a slightly untypical region ( two  sigma ) on the scale of @xmath1 mpc .",
    "before we explain why we can not expect this behavior on larger scales in our model , we briefly sketch the opposite behavior of the backreaction on smaller scales , where a strongly anisotropic collapse into sheet  like and filamentary  like structures features a negative backreaction term @xmath324 and a positive curvature term @xmath50 .",
    "this situation occurs e.g. on the scale of @xmath310 mpc , below which the @xmath322matter component starts to compete with the matter density and mimics the presence of ` dark matter ' .",
    "this result points to the high relevance of the backreaction effect for the explanation of ` dark matter ' in over  densities , while this effect decays on large scales leaving only a few percent remnant on an assumed homogeneity scale of about @xmath3 mpc .",
    "this latter is comparable with the ` dark energy ' remnant on such scales .",
    "both effects thus are small but still alter the large  scale cosmological parameters at the percent level , see fig .",
    "[ fig : xmatscale ] .",
    "there are several serious shortcomings of our model that has a limited architecture as compared with the general situation , below discussed as _",
    "the background problem _ , and also our model is , due to the choice of cdm and @xmath13cdm initial conditions , exploited in a regime where the backreaction effect is not yet effective on large scales , below discussed as _ the amplitude problem_.      in our model the background is \" fictitious  :",
    "while our backreaction models have a generic structure , our quantitative interpretations largely depend on the choice of background @xcite .",
    "the reason is that both of our backgrounds contain a large amount of ` dark matter ' , while the effect we study produces kinematical contributions that act in a similar way .",
    "the same argument holds for the background containing ` dark energy ' .",
    "the implementation of a physical background , defined through the spatial average of the considered fluctuations , is the next step to be envisaged ( compare the first results obtained in @xcite ) .",
    "such a physical background interacts with the backreaction models and thus changes their interpretation . while in the corresponding newtonian model @xcite the background forms the average distribution due to its torus architecture @xcite , i.e. the scale factor @xmath342 on the periodicity scale , the relativistic model studied here must be considered a hybrid construction featuring a volume  scale factor @xmath307 and a background scale factor @xmath173 that only approximately matches the volume ",
    "scale factor on the largest scales as a result of large  scale remnants of backreaction .",
    "an indication for this shortcoming is also that the backreaction model , seen on the flrw background , only covers very restricted subcases of exact gr solutions , unlike the situation in newtonian cosmology , where the plane and spherical collapse is in general covered by the backreaction model .",
    "closely related to the first problem of a background containing a dominating ` dark matter ' component , we here point out a serious mismatch between the time of onset of the actual large ",
    "scale backreaction effect and the age of the universe as it is determined by the background model .",
    "we can take as an indicator the onset of an accelerating period that will set in as a result of dominance of backreaction effects over the density .",
    "such an acceleration may not be needed to explain observational data ; also , it is a strong requirement in view of the smallness of the kinematical backreaction term , which is the only backreaction component entering the volume acceleration equation , while the impact of @xmath343-matter is considerably stronger . from our model",
    "we infer that this acceleration phase is seen in the future on scales roughly above @xmath344 mpc .",
    "this result confirms the amplitude problem already reported in @xcite , if we suppose that backreaction were to replace ` dark energy ' completely . also , if we would consider the analyses presented in this paper in the period of onset of the effect , our quantitative conclusions on the amount of @xmath322matter would substantially change .",
    "thus , all of our results remain conservative  although visible in the fluctuation properties on intermediate and small scales  since the actual effect is postponed to the future due to our standard initial data setting .",
    "we can understand this by a simple consideration : the averaged density decays as @xmath345 , the constant curvature ( contained in the full averaged ricci curvature ) decays as @xmath346 , the leading large  scale mode of the backreaction model ( the kinematical backreaction @xmath325 ) decays as @xmath347 and , finally , the nondecaying cosmological constant .",
    "thus , we expect several periods of onset of dominance of ( i ) the constant  curvature part and later ( ii ) the backreaction contribution , assuming that the cosmological constant is set to zero . as we saw",
    ", this latter period lies in the future for our initial data setting .",
    "there are furthermore limitations due to the model s input of a first - order deformation .",
    "obviously , this limits the range of applicability for the full backreaction regime that here lies in the future , but would anyway not be covered by our extrapolation of a first",
    " order solution . generally , our model is applicable only to large scales , well beyond the scales of virialized objects .",
    "the matter distribution is assumed to be fairly smooth and does not take into account the small - scale discretization .",
    "the importance of the modeling of small - scale structure has to be emphasized .",
    "for example , the determination of the actual volume fraction in devoid regions is needed to precisely quantify the contribution of a negative curvature ( and in turn of the contribution to what would be interpreted as ` dark energy ' in the standard model ) , @xcite , and this sensibly depends on the high - resolution modeling of small - scale structure .",
    "collapse models , as the one based on @xcite , @xcite , have to be refined by e.g. including velocity dispersion . a corresponding argument",
    ", making use of the evolution of the fraction of virialized objects together with an attempt to also model the light cone effect , may give an indication of its quantitative importance @xcite .",
    "clearly , in view of the remarks above , further major efforts are needed , and the present investigation can only be considered as a further step towards quantifying backreaction effects .",
    "we expect , however , that the elements we provided in this work will prove useful for further considerations and the construction of improved models . at any rate , a model based on the rza",
    "is expected to realistically model the large  scale skeleton , and so lies at the heart of any model for structure formation including fully relativistic numerical simulations .",
    "furthermore , the above remark has to be seen in junction with another major effort to reinterpret observational data in the relativistic models : the subtleties and complexity of the interpretation of curvature energies as ` dark energy ' and ` dark matter ' , seen on intermediate scales in our investigation , are not only a challenge in view of the scale dependence of the effect , but imply important changes of light propagation in these models @xcite . here",
    "again the precise modeling of small - scale structure is crucial .",
    "the present investigation reveals , in a quantified way , how we have to proceed in order to master inhomogeneous universe models .",
    "we identify four key questions to be addressed : first , how can we deal with the ` kinematical dark matter ' produced in the relativistic models on all scales , and how does this alter the initial conditions and their compatibility with cmb constraints ?",
    "second , how can we improve the model to quantify the effect on smaller scales than those accessible here ?",
    "third , how can we implement a perturbation scheme on the physical background , given by the average of the model ?",
    "fourth , how are observational data reinterpreted in the relativistic models ?",
    "the answer to the first three questions would alter the time scale of the background , of structure formation and of our interpretation of backreaction .",
    "would this imply a shift of the backreaction regime into an epoch before today ?",
    "interpreting the onset of an acceleration period as coinciding with an apparent acceleration is highly problematic @xcite , we are tempted to require such a shift to solve the ` coincidence problem ' , but an acceleration of the model may after all not be needed to explain observational data .",
    "the answer to the third question will deliver backreaction models that interact with the background ; they will contain , e.g. , the volume scale factor ( and not the flrw scale factor ) , which itself depends on the backreaction terms .",
    "an iterative scheme results that would substantially modify the time scales of our results . in turn , the amplitude of large ",
    "scale backreaction could substantially exceed the @xmath2% effect already present in our model on an assumed homogeneity scale of @xmath3 mpc .",
    "finally , let us emphasize again that we constructed our model by keeping basic cornerstones of the standard model in the early stages of the cosmic evolution .",
    "insufficiency of late ",
    "time backreaction effects may indicate that a more drastic paradigmatic change is needed that takes into account backreaction effects in the early universe : consequences of emerging average properties from inhomogeneous inflationary models @xcite , and cosmological models that are built on global principles like globally stationary cosmologies @xcite , which inherently explain a large backreaction component contained in the physical background , have thus far not been thoroughly analyzed .",

    "<S> kinematical and dynamical properties of a generic inhomogeneous cosmological model , spatially averaged with respect to free  falling ( generalized fundamental ) observers , are investigated for the matter model ` irrotational dust ' . paraphrasing a previous newtonian investigation </S>",
    "<S> , we present a relativistic generalization of a backreaction model based on volume  averaging the ` relativistic zeldovich approximation ' . in this model </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of ` kinematical backreaction ' on the evolution of cosmological parameters as they are defined in an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology , and we show that the backreaction model interpolates between orthogonal symmetry properties by covering subcases of the plane  </S>",
    "<S> symmetric solution , the lematre  tolman  bondi solution and the szekeres solution . </S>",
    "<S> we so obtain a powerful model that lays the foundations for quantitatively addressing curvature inhomogeneities as they would be interpreted as ` dark energy ' or ` dark matter ' in a quasi  newtonian cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the present model , having a limited architecture due to an assumed flrw background , is nevertheless capable of replacing @xmath0 of the needed amount for ` dark energy ' on domains of @xmath1 mpc in diameter for typical ( one  sigma ) fluctuations in a cdm initial power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , the model is far from explaining ` dark energy ' on larger scales ( spatially ) , where a @xmath2% effect on @xmath3 mpc domains is identified that can be traced back to an on average negative intrinsic curvature today . </S>",
    "<S> one drawback of the quantitative results presented is the fact that the epoch when backreaction is effective on large scales and leads to volume acceleration lies in the future . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this issue in relation to the initial spectrum , the ` dark matter ' problem , the coincidence problem , and the fact that large  scale ` dark energy ' is an effect on the past light cone ( not spatial ) , and we pinpoint key elements of future research . </S>"
