    "most galactic black holes are found in transient low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , where bright x - ray outbursts are interspersed with long quiescent periods when the optical light is typically dominated by the companion star .",
    "although one of the earliest proposed black hole candidates @xcite , gx3394  remains one of the most inaccessible to direct measurement of system parameters due to a higher level of x - ray activity ; even when the x - rays are at their faintest , the companion star remains undetectable @xcite .",
    "several orbital periods have been proposed based on both photometric and spectroscopic observations ( 0.62days ; @xcite ; 0.7days ; @xcite ) , but even this most basic of binary parameters remains in dispute . without detecting the companion star in quiescence , this problem seems insurmountable .",
    "however an approach was suggested by the discovery by @xcite of sharp niii  emission components in the bright persistent low - mass x - ray binary sco x-1 .",
    "they were associated with the irradiated companion star and yielded the first radial velocity curve of the companion , and hence the first credible estimate of the binary parameters .    when gx3394  entered a bright x - ray outburst in mid-2002 , we sought to apply this method .",
    "initial observations used the ntt and aat ; follow - up vlt observations were also obtained . the average _",
    "rxte_/asm count rates corresponded to 0.46crab at the first epoch and 0.84crab at the second . here",
    "we report the detection of the companion star in the niii  lines , a new orbital period estimate , and the derived mass function of the compact object .",
    "a future work will perform a thorough analysis of other aspects of this rich dataset .",
    "medium dispersion spectroscopy was obtained with the eso ntt on 2002 june 811 using emmi .",
    "details of all our observations are given in table  [ obstable ] .",
    "on june 8 and 10 we operated the red - arm with the mit / ll detector and grating # 6 , yielding a wavelength coverage of 44105160 . in poorer conditions on june 9 we used the blue arm , tk1034 , and grating # 3 resulting in a lower resolution and wavelength coverage 45004960 .",
    "data reduction was done in iraf to remove the bias level , flat - field , and optimally extract the spectra @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibrations used contemporaneous hear ( red - arm ) or thar ( blue - arm ) arc lamp observations .",
    "the slit was aligned to also include a nearby k star ( star 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "this was rich in absorption lines and so allowed a frame - by - frame check of the stability of the wavelength calibration .",
    "we also used the rgo spectrograph attached to the aat over 2002 june 611 , with the r1200b grating yielding a wavelength coverage of 35005250 .",
    "the images were de - biased and flat - fielded , and the spectra subsequently extracted using conventional optimal extraction techniques @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibrations were interpolated between cuar comparison lamp images , obtained every 2030mins .",
    "a final series of spectra was obtained using uves at the vlt on 2002 august 915 .",
    "six sets of five spectra were obtained in an identical configuration ; the red - arm was used with the eev+mit / ll mosaic and cross - disperser # 3 , yielding a wavelength coverage of 41006200 .",
    "pipeline optimal extractions were supplied and were of good quality .",
    "some spectra exhibited a narrow dip within the bowen blend ; these appear spurious and were masked out of our fits .",
    "the spectrum around 4640  is dominated by two or three emission components ( e.g.  fig .  [ profilefig ] ) .",
    "these are niii  4634 and 4641/42 , which are always present and ciii  4647/50/51 , which is sometimes as strong as the niii  lines and sometimes nearly absent .",
    "this decomposition is the same as suggested for her x-1 @xcite and sco x-1 @xcite .",
    "we will refer to these lines as the bowen blend , although the ciii  emission is not formed by bowen fluorescence . for a radial velocity analysis , we selected only those spectra with sharp components .",
    "the resulting dataset comprised all the ntt red - arm spectra and 7 of the vlt spectra .",
    "no sharp components were detected in the aat or ntt blue spectra , neither were they present in the remainder of the vlt spectra . in our ` sharp component ' spectra ,",
    "we measure average component fwhm of 270kms@xmath1 at the june epoch and 350kms@xmath1 at the second , with no significant width modulation within each epoch .    for each spectrum showing sharp components , we fit with a model comprising two sets of gaussian lines , corresponding to niii4634/41/42  and ciii  4647/50/51 .",
    "the relative ratios within each species were fixed to the values given by @xcite .",
    "we allowed the relative strengths of the niii  and ciii  groups to vary , and fitted for the niii  and ciiivelocities .",
    "the ciii  velocities were discarded as these lines were often barely detectable , and the uncertain ratios of the unresolved 4647/50/51  components renders the effective wavelength of the ciii  blend uncertain .",
    "the niii  velocities were always well constrained , as the 4634  line is well separated from the others .",
    "the most dramatic changes were in the ntt red - arm data , for which we obtained a continuous night of data , about 9hrs . during this period we saw a monotonic trend spanning @xmath0kms@xmath1 .",
    "such narrow components moving at high radial velocity can only readily be explained as due to the orbital motion of the companion star .",
    "the measured components widths are larger than the expected rotational broadening , in particular during our vlt observations .",
    "outflows driven by the x - ray irradiation may be one source of additional broadening mechanisms .",
    "we combined all of the velocities and fitted sinusoidal radial velocity curves as a function of orbital period .",
    "we used a grid of trial periods from 0.12.5days , with a separation of @xmath5days , enough to resolve individual minima .",
    "we plot the minimum @xmath6 as a function of period in fig .",
    "[ periodfig]a .",
    "there are clearly many possible solutions , corresponding to periods around 0.7 , 0.85 , 1.2 , or 1.7days , but the 0.62day period of @xcite is ruled out .",
    "as we will argue , the preferred period is 1.7557days , and the niii  velocities are folded on this period in fig .  [ rvcurvefig]a .      to further constrain the orbital period",
    ", we applied the double gaussian method of @xcite and @xcite to trace the motion of the heii  line wings in the vlt spectra .",
    "these may follow the orbit of the compact object , but even if they are contaminated then any motion should still be on the orbital period .",
    "we use all of the vlt spectra for this analysis . as for the niiivelocities",
    ", we fit a sinusoidal radial velocity curve as a function of orbital period and derive the periodogram shown in fig .",
    "[ periodfig]b .",
    "the only periods common to both the niiidata and the heii  line wings are around 0.7 and 1.7days .",
    "we initially favored the former , as this value had previously been suggested by @xcite .",
    "a significant difficulty with this period , however , is that nearly all the niii  velocities measured correspond to blue - shifts . for an 0.7day period ,",
    "almost the full range of radial velocities should have been sampled and so the systemic velocity of the companion star would have to be extremely large , @xmath7kms@xmath1 . the systemic velocity inferred from the heii  wings , however , is small , only 10kms@xmath1 .",
    "this inconsistency led us to consider whether the longer period might actually be the correct one as this results in consistent and small systemic velocities .",
    "an outstanding question is why only some niii  profiles show sharp components , all corresponding to blue - shifts .",
    "one might naturally expect this to reflect orbital morphology changes , but this is not the case for the 0.7day period ; in this case , spectra showing sharp components overlap in phase with those which do not . on the 1.7day period ,",
    "the two types of profiles are cleanly segregated and do not overlap ; this supports the idea that we are seeing orbital motion of a companion star which is only visible , or only illuminated , at certain orbital phases .",
    "a related problem is that in the long ntt run , the heii  line always showed a blue - shifted peak . as for niii , this is hard to explain with an 0.7day period as other spectra at the same implied orbital phase do not show this asymmetry .",
    "we can quantify it by fitting a single broad gaussian profile to heii , and this line is strong enough that we can use _ all _ of our first epoch data",
    ". the derived radial velocity curve will not have much physical significance , but this does provide a quantitative way to assess which trial periods yield repeatable changes in the line symmetry .",
    "the periodogram , derived as above , is shown in fig .",
    "[ periodfig]c . as for the appearance of sharp bowen components ,",
    "the heii  symmetry changes are modulated on the 1.7day period , but not clearly on the 0.7day one .",
    "we conclude that only a period close to 1.7days is consistent with the niii  velocities and appearance of sharp components ; the heiiwing velocities ; and the changes in the heii  morphology .",
    "this period has the advantage , unlike the others , that a consistent and sensible ( i.e.  close to zero ) systemic velocity is derived for both niii  lines ( which we believe trace the companion star velocity ) and heii  wings .",
    "several aliases ( from the most precise bowen fit ) are consistent with the heii  data .",
    "the best overall fit is for @xmath8days , but @xmath9days or @xmath10days are also possible .",
    "having identified the best - fitting orbital period , we can now fit for orbital velocities .",
    "the most straightforward is the niiimodulation , which must originate from the companion star .",
    "we show the fit to the data in fig .",
    "[ rvcurvefig]a .",
    "the limited phase coverage obviously compromises the accuracy of our results , and we find there is a range of solutions with @xmath11 and @xmath12 positively correlated . for the 1.7557day period ,",
    "the best fit is @xmath13kms@xmath1 , where the error is a 1@xmath14 confidence region with @xmath12 left unconstrained .",
    "this best fit corresponds to @xmath15kms@xmath1 , measured with respect to the local standard of rest . for the 1.7104day period @xmath16kms@xmath1 and for 1.6584days ,",
    "a more conservative constraint is to consider all three aliases as equally valid .",
    "we then derive a 95%  confidence lower limit on @xmath11 of 226kms@xmath1 , corresponding to the 1.6584day period .",
    "these values are all strictly lower limits for @xmath11 , as niii  lines will be formed on the inner , irradiated face of the companion star .",
    "thus they do not trace the motion of its center of mass , but instead have a somewhat _ lower _ velocity .    from these combinations of @xmath18 and @xmath11 , we then derive corresponding mass functions .",
    "our best period corresponds to @xmath19m@xmath3 , whereas the 95%  lower limit is 2.0m@xmath3 .",
    "the best fit mass function significantly exceeds the canonical maximum mass of a neutron star ( 3.0m@xmath3 ) , and even allowing for the shorter period alias , a black hole seems likely , especially as @xmath11 has probably been underestimated .    in principle , we could hope that the wings of the heii  line will follow the compact object .",
    "hence we might derive @xmath20 and the mass ratio . in this case , however , the heii  velocities should be anti - phased with the niii  ones , which is clearly not the case .",
    "rather they are almost in phase with it , as is the overall movement of the heii  line .",
    "this indicates that even the radial velocity curve of the wings is significantly contaminated by heii  emission from the companion and/or the stream - impact point ; the phase offset is in the direction expected for emission from the stream - impact point , as is commonly seen in other lmxbs and cataclysmic variables . at most",
    "we can then hope that the low amplitude of the observed modulation rules out a large @xmath20 . from the vlt data we measure a semi - amplitude of @xmath21kms@xmath1 .",
    "if we then assume @xmath20 is not larger than this , then we expect a mass ratio @xmath22 , similar to other black hole candidates .",
    "this estimate is not secure , however , as one could imagine a situation where contamination of the radial velocity curve could cancel out a larger @xmath20 reducing the overall modulation to close to zero .",
    "our estimate of the mass function is surprisingly large .",
    "it has been widely assumed that the inclination of gx3394  is low ; hence we would expect a lower @xmath11 and a small mass function . the most convincing argument , by @xcite ,",
    "is based on the small peak separation of double - peaked lines .",
    "this is only weakly sensitive to our revised orbital period and is hard to discount .",
    "interpretations of peak separations are not straightforward , however , and when the parameters are known a priori , apparent sub - keplerian motions are often inferred ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence the peak separation is not a reliable diagnostic of the system parameters . nonetheless , the inconsistency of a small peak separation and our moderately large mass function is the most problematic feature of our interpretation .",
    "it is puzzling , and frustrating , that sharp niii  components are not present all the time , instead appearing confined to a limited phase range .",
    "this is why our radial velocity curve is incomplete , despite good orbital phase coverage .",
    "the phase range where they are seen is different at the two epochs ; in our last vlt observation we see them emerge during the sequence , at around phase 0.65 , whereas the ntt observations revealed them earlier than this .",
    "one possible interpretation involves variable shielding of the companion star by a warped disk . the smaller mass ratios of black hole systems compared to those containing neutron stars will reduce the angular size of the companion roche lobe as seen by the x - ray source , so shielding by the disk will be more significant in the black hole case .",
    "if the disk is warped then each hemisphere of the companion may only be illuminated during part of the orbit , as the companion rotates around the nearly stationary warp pattern . as the warp",
    "slowly precesses , the illuminated phase range will migrate as we seem to observe .",
    "of course , the x - ray brightness was also different at the two epochs and other changes in the irradiation geometry could also be responsible for the difference .",
    "we have shown that optical spectroscopy of the bowen blend and heiiare consistent with an orbital period for gx3394  of around @xmath23days .",
    "no other period is simultaneously consistent with all of the data .",
    "furthermore , only this period gives a sensible systemic velocity for the bowen blend lines .",
    "bowen radial velocities reveal a large modulation that must originate from the irradiated inner face of the companion star .",
    "this implies a projected orbital velocity of @xmath24kms@xmath1 for the preferred 1.7557day orbital period ( although strictly this is a lower limit ) .",
    "hence we derive a mass function of @xmath25m@xmath3 for the compact object . for the shortest acceptable alias of the orbital period",
    "we derive a 95%  confidence lower limit to the mass function of 2.0m@xmath3 .",
    "this makes gx3394  a new addition to the list of stellar mass black hole candidates supported by dynamical evidence .",
    "the small modulation to the wings of the heii  line suggests a low mass ratio , @xmath26 , consistent with this interpretation , although this constraint is less secure .",
