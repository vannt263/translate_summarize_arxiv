    "excitons form the basis of optical properties reflecting the intrinsic nature of low - dimensional systems . as a first step we investigate the potential and energy of the electron - hole pair .",

    "but for small @xmath99-values ( which corresponds to large @xmath0 ) there is a underestimation of the exciton energy up to 15 % .",
    "this is not surprising , since the first pad approximation leads to a rather poor fit to the effective potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) )",
