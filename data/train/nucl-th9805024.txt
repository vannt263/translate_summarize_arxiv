    "in the last few years a lot of work has been investigated to study the behavior of vector mesons in a medium with finite baryonic density .",
    "the basic motivation was to find a sign of chiral symmetry restauration in heavy - ion collision experiments , when studying the dilepton spectra which correspond to the vector mesons .",
    "indeed , the ceres experiments for s - au and pb - au collisions show a novel feature when compared to proton - nucleus collisions , namely an enhancement of the dilepton yield for invariant masses somewhat below the vacuum mass of the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "some years ago it was argued by brown and rho that such an enhancement might be due to the restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite . in their model",
    "they assumed that the masses of the vector mesons should scale with the quark condensate , i.e.  drop with rising baryonic density .",
    "if this is true , the @xmath0 peak in the dilepton spectrum would be shifted to lower invariant mass .",
    "this might be an explanation for the observed enhancement of the dilepton yield in that region @xcite .",
    "however , the idea of chiral symmetry restauration alone without additional model assumptions does not provide a unique picture .",
    "other scenarios predict a rising @xmath0 mass based on the effect that the @xmath0 becomes degenerate with its chiral partner , the @xmath1 meson @xcite .",
    "besides the problem what the consequences of chiral symmetry restauration might be there is still the possibility that the experimental finding of the enhancement might also be explained by conventional hadronic degrees of freedom . to clarify that issue hadronic models for the in - medium behavior of vector mesons were developed by various groups , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "some of them predict a large peak broadening of the @xmath0 meson or even distinct new peak structures .",
    "it was found that the enhancement in the dilepton yield might also be explained within a purely hadronic scenario , if a lot of strength is shifted to lower invariant mass @xcite .",
    "so far one is not in a position to confirm or rule out such hadronic models by experimental data .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to find additional model independent consistency checks which should be obeyed by arbitrary hadronic models describing vector mesons and their in - medium behavior .",
    "such a consistency check is provided by the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "originally , qcd sum rules were developed for vacuum processes not as a consistency check for hadronic models , but as an alternative to them , i.e.  to deduce model independent information about hadrons from the underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an important ingredient for the description of vector mesons by qcd sum rules is the assumption that the spectral functions of these resonances can be reliably approximated by @xmath2-functions ( narrow width approximation ) . in this way",
    ", the experimentally found vector meson masses can be reproduced reasonably well .",
    "of course , it is supported by experiments that e.g.  the respective width of the spectral function of @xmath0 and @xmath3 meson is small as compared to the mass of the meson .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the narrow width approximation is not a result , but an ingredient of the traditional qcd sum rule approach .    in the last few years",
    "qcd sum rules were also developed for in - medium situations , i.e.  for hadronic matter at finite temperature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or finite baryonic density ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons",
    "it was found that their masses decrease with increasing temperature and/or density , if the narrow width approximation is used for the parametrization of the respective spectral function .",
    "in contrast to the vacuum case , there is , however , no experimental support that the narrow width approximation is a reasonable assumption for the in - medium case .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation crucially influences the qcd sum rule prediction for a possible mass shift in a nuclear surrounding .",
    "if a spectral function with an appropriately chosen large width is used in the qcd sum rule approach at finite density , one could get an unshifted meson mass , in contrast to the finding utilizing the narrow width approximation .",
    "this was first discussed in @xcite using a specific hadronic model and later systematically studied in @xcite .",
    "this shows that qcd sum rules provide _ no _ model independent prediction about a possible mass shift of vector mesons in nuclear medium .",
    "only together with some additional assumptions ( e.g.  about the width of the respective vector meson ) a statement about the density dependence of the masses of the vector mesons can be deduced from the sum rule analysis .",
    "nevertheless , once a hadronic model for vector mesons has been chosen the sum rules can be used as a consistency check for this model .",
    "we believe it to be important to have such consistency checks , since it is not clear _ a priori _ if a hadronic model  e.g.  with coupling constants derived from vacuum processes  yields a correct description of the in - medium behavior .    in most of the studies on qcd sum rules",
    "only the vector mesons which are at rest with respect to the medium were considered . on the other hand ,",
    "since lorentz invariance is broken , the behavior of vector mesons clearly depends on their velocity with respect to the surrounding .",
    "indeed , some of the hadronic models mentioned above yield very different spectral functions for different three - momenta of the respective vector meson and for different polarizations ( e.g.  @xcite ) . only recently",
    ", the influence of finite three - momentum on the qcd sum rule prediction for vector meson masses ( within the classical narrow width approximation ) was explored @xcite .",
    "also at finite three - momentum , of course , the narrow width approximation is an assumption which may be justified or not , but in any case it is not a model - independent statement .    in this work",
    "we will derive qcd sum rules for @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons for arbitrary three - momentum of the respective vector meson with respect to the nuclear medium .",
    "the purpose is to provide a consistency check for hadronic models .",
    "this is in contrast to the traditional qcd sum rule approach which aims at a prediction for the vector meson mass assuming that the width of the vector meson is negligibly small ( cf .",
    "especially @xcite concerning the extension to non - vanishing three - momentum within the traditional qcd sum rule approach ) . in the application of the traditional qcd sum rule approach to nuclear matter",
    "the attention was focused on the utilization of the sum rule within the narrow width approximation @xcite , rather than on a detailed discussion of the derivation of the sum rule and of the calculation of the various condensates which contribute . in the present article",
    "we try to bridge this gap .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic quantity of interest , namely the current - current correlator and present a dispersion relation which connects the calculations for this correlator using hadronic degrees of freedom on the one hand side and quarks and gluons on the other . in section [ sec : ope ]",
    "we sketch the method of operator product expansion and calculate the current - current correlator within that framework . in section [ sec : sumrule ]",
    "we present a qcd sum rule derived from the dispersion relation mentioned above . to get more insight into the various contributions calculated in section [ sec : ope ] we discuss in section [ sec :",
    "lindens ] an approximation linear in the nuclear density . in section",
    "[ sec : crit ] we discuss the various approximations which have led to the results presented in the preceding sections .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the quantity we study in the following is the covariant time ordered current - current correlator @xmath4 here @xmath5 is an electromagnetic current with the isospin quantum number of the respective vector meson , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is for the @xmath0 meson and @xmath8 for the @xmath3 .",
    "the current - current correlator enters e.g.  the cross section of @xmath9 hadrons ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . within a simple vector meson dominance ( vmd )",
    "picture the current ( [ eq : curud ] ) can be identified with the vector meson which carries the respective isospin , e.g.  for the @xmath0 meson @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath0 meson field amplitude and @xmath12 the coupling of the @xmath0 meson to pions .",
    "therefore , within simple vmd the current - current correlator is proportional to the propagator of the respective vector meson .",
    "speaking more generally , i.e.  without referring to simple vmd , the vector meson propagator is closely related to the current - current correlator .    the expectation value in ( [ eq : curcur ] )",
    "is taken with respect to the surrounding medium .",
    "we study here a ( isospin neutral ) homogeneous equilibrated medium with finite nuclear density and vanishing temperature . in the medium lorentz invariance is broken .",
    "all the formulae we will present in the following refer to the lorentz frame where the medium is at rest , i.e.  where the spatial components of the baryonic current vanish .    the current - current correlator can be decomposed in the following way @xcite : @xmath13 where we have introduced two independent projectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 which both satisfy current conservation @xmath16 and add up to @xmath17 the tensors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are transverse and longitudinal with respect to three - momentum @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is given by @xmath21 while @xmath19 can be deduced from ( [ eq : unitsub ] ) .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath22 can be obtained by @xmath23 and @xmath24 to get the respective last equality in the last two equations , use is made of the fact that @xmath25 is a conserved quantity , i.e.  transverse with respect to the _ four_-momentum @xmath26 . note that @xmath27 and @xmath28 depend only on the invariant mass squared , @xmath29 , and on the three - momentum squared , @xmath30 .",
    "the latter property is due to the remaining @xmath31 symmetry of the equilibrated system .    at vanishing temperature the scalar functions",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 deduced from the time ordered current - current correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) can be related to the commutator ( spectral function ) @xmath32 \\rangle\\ ] ] in the following way ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are deduced from @xmath36 analogously to ( [ eq : pit ] ) and ( [ eq : pil ] ) , respectively . at first sight",
    ", it seems that @xmath37 does not only depend on @xmath29 and @xmath30 as claimed above , but also on the sign of @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is easy to check from the definition ( [ eq : defspecmunu ] ) and the symmetry properties of the system under consideration that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are antisymmetric with respect to the transformation @xmath39",
    ". therefore we define @xmath40 inserting this relation in ( [ eq : impia ] ) , @xmath41 it becomes obvious that the dependence on the sign of @xmath38 is only apparent .    for @xmath42 the current - current correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] )",
    "can be calculated using wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite for quark and gluonic degrees of freedom @xcite ( for in - medium calculations see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we shall call the result of that calculation @xmath43 . on the other hand , a hadronic model ( e.g.  for vector mesons @xcite using one or the other form of vmd ) can give an expression for the current - current correlator valid in the time like region @xmath44 .",
    "we denote the result of the hadronic model by @xmath45 .",
    "a second representation in the space like region which has to match @xmath43 can be obtained from @xmath45 by utilizing a twice subtracted dispersion relation .",
    "we find @xmath46 with the subtraction constant @xmath47 as we shall see below @xmath48 diverges linearly with @xmath29 .",
    "therefore we have used above a twice subtracted dispersion relation . in the space like region for @xmath49",
    "we get the following connection between the current - current correlator calculated from ope on the one hand side and from a hadronic model on the other : @xmath50 where we have used ( [ eq : impiapl ] ) to express the spectral function in terms of the imaginary part of @xmath51 .    in the next section",
    "we shall elaborate on the calculation of the l.h.s .  of ( [ eq : opehad ] ) .",
    "within the method of operator product expansion we have to calculate the current - current correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) for large space like momenta @xmath52 . here",
    "the relevant length scale for the @xmath53-integration given by the inverse of @xmath54 is small .",
    "this defines the hard scale in our problem .",
    "suppose that the distance @xmath53 is much smaller than the typical length of the system ( soft scale ) .",
    "the latter might be characterized e.g.  by the average particle distance in the medium or @xmath55 as the scale where non perturbative effects appear .",
    "if @xmath53 is that small it is reasonable to assume that a product of local operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 should look like a local operator , since the system can not resolve such small distances @xmath53 . thus we find @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes c - number functions ( wilson coefficients ) and @xmath61 _ local _ operators .",
    "the only dependence on the system under consideration enters via the respective matrix elements of the local operators @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the dependence on the soft scale is entirely given by the local operators .",
    "on the other hand , the wilson coefficients @xmath60 can be calculated independently from the system under consideration . since the operators",
    "@xmath61 are local , the dependence on the hard scale ( here given by the @xmath53-dependence ) enters only the wilson coefficients .",
    "thus we have achieved a separation of the hard from the soft scale .    in our case , the operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the currents @xmath5 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the fourier transformation which appears in ( [ eq : curcur ] ) does not touch the local operators @xmath61 , but only changes the @xmath53-dependence of @xmath60 into a @xmath26-dependence . from the line of arguments",
    "one can already guess that the wilson coefficients finally yield a power series in @xmath63 ( corrected by logarithms from renormalization ) .",
    "the expectation values of the local operators @xmath61 ( condensates ) show up as coefficients of that series . on dimensional grounds",
    "it is obvious that the higher the dimension ( in terms of masses ) of a condensate is , the more it is suppressed by powers of @xmath63 .    in the following",
    "we will consider condensates up to dimension 6 . in vacuum only scalar condensates contribute .",
    "for the case at hand , however , the condensates might also carry spin , since lorentz invariance is broken .",
    "it is common practice to classify the condensates by their dimensionality @xmath64 and their twist @xmath65 .",
    "the latter is defined as the difference of dimension @xmath64 and spin @xmath66 , i.e.  @xmath67 .",
    "we decompose the current - current correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) in the following way : @xmath68 where we have neglected contributions from higher dimensional condensates .",
    "we will discuss the various contributions separately in the following subsections .",
    "the contribution of the scalar condensates to the current - current correlator for the system with finite nuclear density is formally identical to the vacuum case .",
    "the only difference is that in the former case the expectation value is taken with respect to the medium .",
    "the latter case was already discussed in the original paper by shifman et al .",
    "the result is ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite for details ) @xmath69 with @xmath70 where we have neglected contributions quadratic in the light current quark mass @xmath71 as well as differences in the masses of up and down quark .",
    "this is reasonable , since the hard scale @xmath72 is typically of the order of @xmath73gev ( the order of magnitude of the considered vector meson ) , while the masses of up and down quarks are of the order of a few mev .",
    "again the @xmath7 sign refers to the @xmath0 meson and the @xmath8 to the @xmath3 . to simplify ( [ eq : scal2 ] ) we assume that the quark condensates of up and down quarks are approximately the same .",
    "furthermore , we replace the four - quark condensates by products of two - quark condensates .",
    "since it is not clear how accurate the assumption of ground state saturation ( hartree approximation ) is , we multiply the result with a ( still to be determined ) factor @xmath74 .",
    "we end up with @xmath75 note that there is no difference between @xmath0 and @xmath3 any more , since there are no terms like @xmath76 in an isospin neutral medium .",
    "of course , the crucial question is , how to evaluate the expectation values with respect to the nuclear medium . if the density is small , it is reasonable to approximate the medium by a fermi gas of free nucleons , i.e. , @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the vacuum expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath79 , @xmath80 the fermi momentum , @xmath81 the energy of a nucleon , and @xmath82 a single ( isospin averaged ) nucleon state with momentum @xmath83 normalized according to @xmath84 we will use the approximation ( [ eq : fermi ] ) throughout this work and comment on it in section [ sec : crit ] .",
    "if @xmath79 is a scalar operator , the expectation value @xmath85 is a scalar as well and therefore independent of the momentum of the nucleon .",
    "thus we get @xmath86 for the evaluation of the condensates in ( [ eq : scal3 ] ) we need to know the expectation values of the quark and gluon condensate with respect to single nucleon states .",
    "the former can be related to the nucleon sigma term @xcite , @xmath87 while the latter can be calculated from the trace anomaly of qcd , @xmath88 here @xmath89 denotes the nucleon sigma term and @xmath90 the nucleon mass in the chiral limit .",
    "finally , we have to make a choice for the parameter @xmath74 which parametrized the deviation of the four - quark condensate from the product of two - quark condensates .",
    "even for the vacuum case , the question about the value for @xmath74 is not settled yet ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath74 might depend on the nuclear density . for simplicity ,",
    "we take in the following the vacuum value for @xmath74 also for arbitrary finite densities , but note that this introduces an uncertainty into the evaluation of the ope .",
    "all the parameters not specified so far are taken from @xcite and listed in table [ tab : para ] .",
    "we discuss this choice in section [ sec : crit ] .    using ( [ eq : pit],[eq : pil],[eq : scalope1],[eq : scal3],[eq : condscal]-[eq : traceano ] )",
    "we are able to calculate the contribution of the scalar condensates to the l.h.s .  of [ eq : opehad ] ) .",
    "in the next subsection we discuss the contribution of the twist-2 condensates with @xmath64@xmath914 .      in vacuum",
    "only scalar condensates contribute to the current - current correlator since there is no lorentz vector which can account for the spin of a non - scalar condensate .",
    "contrary to the vacuum case , in a nuclear medium the baryonic current can yield the spin . using the approximation ( [ eq : fermi ] )",
    "we find for spin-2 condensates @xmath92 in this approximation the four - momentum of the nucleon accounts for the spin of the condensate .",
    "thus we get @xmath93 note that the non - scalar operators are traceless with respect to the lorentz indices .",
    "expectation values of twist-2 condensates with respect to single nucleon states as they appear in ( [ eq : fermispin2 ] ) are thoroughly studied in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , albeit for a somewhat different kinematical situation .",
    "we can utilize the results obtained there for our case at hand  as already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will not give a detailed calculation for the contributions of these condensates to the current - current correlator , but instead present a recipe how to deduce the necessary information from the dis calculations of @xcite .",
    "the twist-2 operators of dimensionality 4 which contribute are given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 here @xmath96 denotes an operator producing an expression which is symmetric and traceless with respect to the lorentz indices @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 is the covariant derivative and @xmath100 the gluonic field strength tensor . in principle , composite operators mix under the renormalization group , if they have the same quantum numbers @xcite . to study that mixing we have to decompose ( [ eq : op22q ] ) in a flavor singlet part which mixes with the gluonic operator ( [ eq : op22 g ] ) and a flavor non - singlet part which does not mix . for the energy region of interest , i.e.  roughly about the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath3 meson",
    ", we have to deal with three active flavors .",

    "note that the factor @xmath109 in the definition of the current ( [ eq : curud ] )  which enters ( [ eq : curcur ] ) quadratically  is not contained in the definition of the forward scattering amplitude , but is given in ( [ eq : scattintro ] ) explicitly .",
    "the strategy to utilize the dis results for the forward scattering amplitude ( [ eq : fsa22 ] ) is the following : we make a general ansatz for this amplitude , specify it to the dis case , match it with the calculations of @xcite , and determine in this way the unknown quantities of the general ansatz .",

    "obviously , the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath3 meson is only very small and vanishes with rising @xmath212 .",
    "the latter observation can be easily understood recalling that the only difference in the ope s for @xmath0 and @xmath3 comes from the twist-4 spin-2 condensates which are suppressed at least by a factor @xmath234 .",
    "hence , the suppression becomes more effective with rising @xmath212 .",
    "note that the small difference between @xmath0 and @xmath3 does not necessarily mean that there is not much difference in their spectral functions .",
    "it only means that the integrated quantity given in ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) ( to be rigorous : the r.h.s .  of that equation )",
    "is nearly the same for both mesons .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is nearly insensitive to the choice for the meson provides a strong constraint on a hadronic model which aims at a description of @xmath0 and @xmath3 on the same footing , like e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we also observe that the dependence of the l.h.s .  of the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) on the three - momentum @xmath20 is rather weak .",
    "this also constrains the hadronic model .",
    "again , we stress that this does not mean that the dependence of the spectral function on the three - momentum is weak .",

    "we close this section with some remarks on the respective size of the `` fit parameters '' @xmath215 and @xmath236 . clearly , the more fit parameters we have the less restrictive is the sum rule for the hadronic model which should be checked .",
    "at least , it is therefore important to get an idea about the size and the possible influence of the fit parameters .    in vacuum",
    "the continuum threshold @xmath215 turns out to be about @xmath240gev@xmath241 @xcite .",
    "at least it has to be below the exited states of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "model calculations suggest that the threshold decreases with increasing density @xcite .    concerning the subtraction constant @xmath236 it is important to note that within the fermi gas approximation it can be rigorously calculated for vanishing three - momentum @xcite . here",
    "it turned out that it is so small that it would not change the results drastically , if it is simply neglected .",
    "unfortunately , the expectation that it could be neglected also for finite three - momentum is presumably not justified .",
    "if we use the full electromagnetic current in ( [ eq : curud ] ) instead of a part of it with well - defined isospin , then within the fermi gas approximation the transverse part of the subtraction constant would simply be the real part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath242 of a ( real ) photon with momentum @xmath20 on a nucleon with momentum @xmath83 averaged over the fermi sphere , i.e. , @xmath243 where we have used the linear density approximation ( cf .  next section ) to obtain the last expression .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath244 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath245 .",
    "thus , to get an idea about the size of the corresponding quantity in the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) we have plotted in figure [ fig : feuster ] the quantity @xmath246 as a function of the photon energy @xmath247 for nuclear saturation density and a typical value for the borel mass , @xmath248gev .",
    "we have used the model for photoproduction presented in @xcite to obtain the real part of the isospin averaged photon - nucleon forward scattering amplitude . comparing the absolute sizes in figure [ fig : lhstrexact ] and [ fig : feuster ] we find indeed that the subtraction constant might be negligible for @xmath249 , but not for arbitrary three - momentum .",
    "especially , if we are interested in the dependence on the three - momentum we have to take the subtraction constant into account , since the variation of the curves in [ fig : lhstrexact ] with three - momentum is of the same order of magnitude as the quantity plotted in figure [ fig : feuster ] . concerning the longitudinal part of the subtraction constant we can not compare with photon - nucleon scattering , since there are no real longitudinal photons .",
    "therefore , we refrain from presenting any estimates for this case .    of course , the most fortunate situation would be , if the considered hadronic model already provides a value for @xmath236 .",
    "then , only the continuum threshold @xmath215 would remain as a fit parameter .",
    "obviously , the contributions of the ope presented in section [ sec : ope ] are quite unillustrative , simply due to its complexity . to get more insight in the various contributions we restrict ourselves in this section to the parts which are at most linear in the nuclear density , i.e.  cubic in the fermi momentum .",
    "recalling that we have evaluated all in - medium condensates using the fermi gas approximation ( [ eq : fermi ] ) we have neglected nucleon - nucleon correlations anyway which are quadratic in the density .",
    "thus , the results presented in section [ sec : ope ] are at best correct up to fermi momentum to the power of five , i.e.  up to @xmath250 .",

    "in @xcite it was found that already at nuclear saturation density it is important to account for such processes . on the other hand , presumably in every hadronic model one can distinguish between single and multi - nucleon interactions .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to compare the ope calculation with the hadronic model treated in a `` single nucleon mode '' .",
    "this comparison was e.g.  performed in @xcite for vanishing three - momentum @xmath20 . if in the framework of a hadronic model it turns out that interactions with more than one nucleon are important for the nuclear density under consideration , then the qcd sum rule can not serve to check the consistency of the whole hadronic model but only of its restriction to scattering processes of the vector meson with one nucleon from the fermi sphere .    after these general considerations about the validity of the calculation of in - medium condensates we turn now to the discussion of the accuracy in the determination of the different types of condensates .    concerning the scalar condensates of subsection [ sec : scal ] we have neglected there terms which are quadratic in the light current quark masses @xmath71 as well as possible differences in the condensates of up and down quarks .",

    "figures [ fig : lhstrexact ] , [ fig : lhsloexact ] ) , the neglect of @xmath297 terms is very well justified . also , a possible difference between up and down quark condensate is presumably small and anyway hard to disentangle in view of the uncertainties in the determination of the ( average ) light quark condensate ( see e.g.  discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the contribution from the two - quark condensate to ( [ eq : scal3 ] ) is much smaller than the one from the gluon condensate .",
    "the largest uncertainty lies in the evaluation of the four - quark condensate , i.e.  in the value for @xmath74 .",
    "first , even the vacuum value is still under discussion .",
    "second , it might very well be that the value for @xmath74 varies with nuclear density . concerning the first problem",
    ", it is useful to choose a hadronic model which describes the data for @xmath298 hadrons reasonably well and utilize the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) for the vacuum case to determine @xmath74 .",
    "this was performed in @xcite and we therefore have taken the condensate values given there .",
    "for the second problem we have no solution to offer so far . without any better knowledge we use the vacuum value for @xmath74 also at finite density .",
    "to get rid of this uncertainty one can differentiate the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) with respect to the three - momentum squared @xmath30 . in this way ,",
    "all scalar condensates drop out , since they do not yield @xmath30-dependent contributions to the ope side of the sum rule . as already discussed in section [ sec : lindens ] this differentiated sum rule results in a lower limit for the borel window which is much higher than the one for the original sum rule .",
    "this might diminish or even close the borel window , i.e.  the thus obtained sum rule might be less reliable or even useless .",
    "this clearly depends on the explicit hadronic model under consideration .",
    "the twist-2 condensates discussed in subsections [ sec : t2s2 ] , [ sec : t2s4 ] are the best known contributions , as soon as one accepts the fermi gas approximation discussed above .",
    "we even can use the results of dis to get an idea about the neglected higher order condensates ( see below ) .",
    "the twist-4 spin-2 condensates can in principle also be deduced from dis data .",
    "the uncertainties in their extraction are , however , quite large .",
    "we have adopted the analysis of @xcite .",
    "there , condensates depending on the light current quark masses , strange quark contributions and dependences on the renormalization scale were neglected .",
    "these errors are presumably smaller than the uncertainties in the extraction of these condensates from dis data . in general , the contributions of the twist-4 spin-2 condensates are small as compared to the twist-2 spin-2 contributions .",
    "for the @xmath30-contributions to the longitudinal direction , however , the twist-2 spin-2 contribution is suppressed by @xmath128 . there , the twist-4 spin-2 condensates can not be disregarded @xcite .",
    "of course , one is forced to somewhere cut off the ope used here as an expansion in the dimensionality of the condensates .",
    "we have neglected all condensates of dimensionality 8 or higher .",
    "to get an idea about the size of the neglected condensates we calculate now the twist-2 spin-6 contribution to the current - current correlator , since we have access on that quantity utilizing the dis results .",
    "the calculation proceeds along the lines described in subsections [ sec : t2s2 ] , [ sec : t2s4 ] .",
    "we use the fermi gas approximation @xmath299 and the decomposition @xmath300 the relevant operators are @xmath301 and @xmath302 from the dis calculations we can deduce the following contribution to the current - current correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) which was neglected in ( [ eq : curcurdtau ] ) : @xmath303 with the forward scattering amplitude @xmath304 with this at hand we can calculate the ratio between the twist-2 spin-6 contribution to the l.h.s .  of the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) and the total value for this l.h.s .  as calculated in section [ sec : ope ] . we have calculated that ratio in figures [ fig : errortr ] , [ fig : errorlo ] for transverse and longitudinal directions and for @xmath0 and @xmath3 meson .",
    "obviously , the obtained ratios are very small justifying at least the neglect of twist-2 spin-6 condensates and suggesting that all higher dimensional condensates are reasonably suppressed .",
    "of course , for a thorough discussion of the error made by neglecting higher dimensional condensates we also would need to know the other condensates beside the twist-2 spin-6 condensates . since we do not know e.g.  the scalar @xmath276@xmath91@xmath305 condensates etc",
    "the error analysis presented here is only a first guess .",
    "as long as we do not know the actual values of the neglected condensates ( or at least an upper limit for them ) we can not present a rigorous proof that the ope approach works , i.e.  that the truncated series yields a reliable value for the current - current correlator in the region of interest . indeed , in @xcite it was doubted that the qcd sum rule approach provides any reliable information about the medium modifications of vector mesons ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "two arguments were given there to support these doubts : the first , qualitative argument concerns the connection between the mass shift of a vector meson and the forward scattering amplitude of this vector meson with a nucleon .",
    "it was argued there that the forward scattering amplitude and hence also the mass shift is a long distance property , while the ope is only capable of short distance properties .",
    "we think that this argument is misleading , since the ope always concerns the interplay of long and short distance properties , as already pointed out in section [ sec : ope ] .",
    "actually , in the same oversimplifying way one might argue just the other way round : the in - medium @xmath0 mass is still large , i.e.  a short distance property , and therefore can be described by the ope approach .",
    "this shows that one needs more quantitative arguments to check the validity of the sum rule approach .",
    "a useful selfconsistency check within the borel sum rule method is the borel stability analysis described in section [ sec : sumrule ] : a breakdown of the sum rule might be observed in a small or even vanishing borel window .",
    "indeed , this stability analysis was the key point to resolve the question , whether mass shift and/or forward scattering amplitude can be extracted within the traditional sum rule approach utilizing the narrow width approximation .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details . in general , the borel window",
    "can only be determined after specifying a hadronic model .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss this point here any further .",
    "the preceding discussion has clearly emphasized the necessity to perform a borel stability analysis .    a second",
    ", formal argument has been raised in @xcite against the applicability of the ope approach to vector mesons in nuclear medium : it was claimed there that the ope turns out to be an expansion in the nucleon mass @xmath306 over the invariant mass @xmath72 .",
    "after borelization this would turn into an expansion in @xmath306 over the borel mass @xmath198 .",
    "if the latter is assumed to be of the order of the @xmath0 meson mass , one would get an expansion parameter @xmath307 which is obviously not small .",
    "therefore , it was argued in @xcite that the truncation of the ope at the @xmath64@xmath91@xmath147 condensates is not appropriate .",
    "indeed , concerning the twist-2 condensates the statement is true that the used ope is an expansion in @xmath308 .",
    "this can most easily be discussed within the linear density approximation of section [ sec : lindens ] .",
    "e.g.  for vanishing three - momentum the twist-2 spin-2 condensates contribute with a term proportional to @xmath309 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : ldc24 t ] ) ) and the twist-2 spin-4 condensates with a term proportional to @xmath310 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : ldc36 t ] ) ) . in general",
    ", the twist-2 spin-@xmath66 condensates yield a contribution @xmath311 .",
    "since the nucleon mass @xmath306 is large this expansion might break down for the borel masses of interest ( typically of the order of @xmath73gev ) .",
    "however , one should not discuss the convergence of a series without looking at its coefficients .",
    "the twist-2 spin-@xmath66 contribution is accompanied by the @xmath66-th moment of the parton distributions .",
    "inspecting the last two lines of table [ tab : coeff ] we find that these moments become very small with increasing @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , we have already discussed above that the twist-2 spin-6 condensates do not spoil the truncation of the ope  in spite of the fact that they are proportional to @xmath312 .",
    "this shows that also the second argument raised in @xcite against the qcd sum rule approach is oversimplified .",
    "this work was motivated by the finding that the qcd sum rule approach provides no model independent prediction about a possible mass shift of vector mesons in nuclear medium @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have discussed at length that the sum rule restricts the @xmath0 meson only to a rather wide area in the ( mass , width ) plane without making any further statements about the specific properties of the @xmath0 meson . only within additional model assumptions the behavior of the @xmath0 meson in nuclear matter can be further specified .",
    "e.g. , if one _ assumes _ that the width of the @xmath0 meson is not increased , then the sum rule predicts a @xmath0 mass which decreases with increasing nuclear density .",
    "however , it is also possible to _ assume _ instead that the @xmath0 mass is not shifted . in this case",
    "the sum rule suggests an increasing width of the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this , however , does not mean that the sum rule approach is useless : we have presented here a qcd sum rule for @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons propagating with arbitrary three - momentum through nuclear matter at vanishing temperature .",
    "this sum rule provides a non - trivial consistency check for hadronic models which describe that propagation .",
    "at least as long as different hadronic models can not be judged unambiguously by experiments such consistency checks are important to confirm or rule out hadronic models .    the main formula is given in ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) .",
    "the ope coefficients @xmath189 which appear on the l.h.s",
    ".  of this formula are defined via @xmath313 in ( [ eq : opegenform ] ) . in view of their complexity",
    "we have not given the explicit formulae for @xmath189 .",
    "however , they can be easily deduced in the following way from the equations presented in section [ sec : ope ] : transverse and longitudinal part of @xmath313 are obtained from the respective last expression of ( [ eq : pit ] ) and ( [ eq : pil ] ) .",
    "the current - current correlator with the full lorentz structure , @xmath314 is decomposed in ( [ eq : curcurdtau ] ) .",
    "the scalar contribution is given in ( [ eq : scalope1 ] ) where @xmath315 can be read off from ( [ eq : scal3 ] ) .",
    "the expectation values showing up there are decomposed in vacuum and medium dependent expectation values in ( [ eq : condscal ] ) using the fermi gas approximation .",
    "the vacuum expectation values are listed in table [ tab : para ] .",
    "finally , the medium dependent parts of the scalar condensates are connected in ( [ eq : nucsig],[eq : traceano ] ) with parameters also listed in table [ tab : para ] .    the contribution from the twist-2 spin-2 condensates",
    "is given in ( [ eq : piscam22fin],[eq : scam22fin ] ) with the traceless tensor @xmath316 defined in ( [ eq : trls ] ) .",
    "in the same way the contribution from the twist-2 spin-4 condensates is given in ( [ eq : piscam24fin],[eq : scam24fin ] ) with the traceless tensor @xmath317 defined in ( [ eq : trlspin4 ] ) .",
    "the required values for the moments of the parton distributions @xmath157 and the coefficients @xmath124 are collected in table [ tab : coeff ] .    the contribution from the twist-4 spin-2 condensates",
    "is given in ( [ eq : scattintro4],[eq : ans24 ] ) where the coefficients @xmath318 are connected in ( [ eq : tb1rhom],[eq : tb2rhom ] ) to quantities listed in table [ tab : para ] .    in this way , the ope coefficients can be easily calculated . as discussed in the last section the qcd sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) can be used to check the consistency of a hadronic model , provided that in the latter the medium is also described by the fermi gas approximation .",
    "going one step further by neglecting the fermi motion of the nucleons both in the hadronic model under consideration and in the calculation of the ope coefficients one might also utilize the sum rule in this linear density approximation . for this case",
    "the ope coefficients @xmath189 are explicitly given in ( [ eq : csplitd4d6]-[eq : ldc56l ] ) .    by inspecting the qcd sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule2 ] ) we observe that the hadronic model which should be checked has to yield the current - current correlator for invariant masses in the region @xmath319 to @xmath215 .",
    "the lower limit refers to vanishing energy . for non - vanishing three - momentum",
    "this means that we need information not only about the time like , but also about the space like region . for small three - momenta the space like region",
    "is dominated by the coupling of the respective vector meson to nucleon - hole states @xcite . for higher three - momenta also resonance - hole loops",
    "come into play in the space like region ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , at finite nuclear density there are important structures in the spectral function of the vector mesons also in the space like region .",
    "this is in contrast to the vacuum case where there is no structure below the two - pion ( three - pion ) threshold for the @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) meson .",
    "qualitatively , we have found that our sum rules are not very sensitive to the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath3 meson as well as to a variation in the three - momentum of the vector meson with respect to the nuclear medium .",
    "this , however , does not a priori mean that the current - current correlator for different isospin channels and for different three - momenta should be more or less the same . in the sum rule only an integral over",
    "this correlator enters which might be the same e.g.  for @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons , even if the respective correlators themselves are different .",
    "thus , on this qualitative level the sum rule approach does not rule out hadronic models which predict a different behavior of vector mesons with different three - momenta , like e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a quantitative analysis of these models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we believe that the qcd sum rule presented here provides an interesting and non - trivial consistency check for hadronic models which describe vector mesons in nuclear matter .",
    "we have tried to present the derivation of the sum rule in great detail to make it possible also for non - experts in ope to utilize the sum rule for a consistency check of their hadronic models .",
