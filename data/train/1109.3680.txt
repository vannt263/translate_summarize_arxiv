    "another important example is the sign of the hopping matrix element ( or hopping integral ) @xmath4 of the hamiltonian between two non - equivalent localized orbitals @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a tight - binding formalism .",
    "this phase , a fundamental quantity in determining the electronic structure of a system , is dictated by the characteristics of the atomistic interaction , e.g. , whether it is attractive or repulsive .",
    "both of these are important to directly extract fundamental quantum electronic information on a variety of materials  @xcite .    in graphene",
    ", the berry s phase is theoretically extracted from the spinor eigenstate , which are @xmath7 for single- and @xmath8 for double - layer graphene  @xcite . from recent studies ,",
    "the @xmath9 berry s phase in the commonly used form of the spinor states is , in fact , related to the pseudospin winding number @xmath10 of a particle as it travels in a loop in @xmath11-space which encloses the dirac point  @xcite .",
    "these values have been measured through magneto - transport experiments  @xcite that are typically neither capable of measuring berry s phase of a specific electron bandstructure nor free from spin / valley degeneracy of the electron bandstructure of a system under study .",
    "additionally , this method requires a strong magnetic field , which breaks time - reversal symmetry in graphene .",
    "meanwhile , the signs of hopping integrals between non - equivalent orbitals for graphene ( graphite ) have only been determined by _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite , e.g. , using maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite .",
    "since the sign of hopping integral depends on the characteristics of the localized orbitals and the interaction between them , it is crucial in determining the electron bandstructure within a tight - binding formalism .",
    "however , the absence of methodology has led to use the signs following the well - known slonczewski - weiss - mcclure model  @xcite without experimental verification for the past few decades .",
    "additionally , the sign of hopping integral between non - equivalent orbitals has never been determined experimentally for any material .",
    "given the high momentum - resolving power of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , arpes is an ideal candidate to solve the above issues on the determination of quantum phases .",
    "for example , the phase difference between the matrix elements describing two different optical transitions at the ( 110 ) surface of platinum was extracted from a combined study of a spin - resolved arpes experiment and a theoretical model  @xcite .",
    "also , arpes has been employed to study the characteristics of the spinor eigenstates in graphite  @xcite and graphene  @xcite , which revealed an interference effect between photo - excited electrons  @xcite .",
    "however , these theoretical studies , within a tight - binding formalism , have incorrectly treated the interaction hamiltonian , which is the key part in the photoemission process as it describes the interaction between photons and electrons .",
    "moreover , it has not been clear how berry s phase enters in arpes intensity and the sign of hopping integral has only been speculated without any comparison with experiments  @xcite , which naturally leads to incorrect values .    here we report that arpes can indeed provide information on these quantum phases , e.g. , the berry s phase and the sign of hopping integral between non - equivalent orbitals . the phase factor in the spinor eigenstate of graphene",
    "@xcite gives rise to strong intensity variation around a constant energy contour .",
    "upon rotating light polarization by @xmath0 , we found that graphene with a berry s phase of @xmath1 ( @xmath2  1 for single- and @xmath2  2 for double - layer graphene ) exhibits the rotation of arpes intensity maxima by @xmath3 , which gives important advantages compared to the conventional magneto - transport method  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we found that full polarization - dependence of arpes signal reveals the sign of hopping integrals in both single- and double - layer graphene ( graphite can also be understood ) , e.g. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which is the first experimental determination of the sign of hopping integral between non - equivalent orbitals for any material by any method .",

    "an sic sample was mounted in a prep - chamber with a base pressure of 5@xmath1510@xmath16 torr to remove a thick oxide layer from the sample by heating at 600 @xmath17c for a few hours .",
    "the clean sample was then transferred to a custom - designed chamber equipped with low - energy - electron microscopy ( leem ) with a base pressure of 2@xmath1510@xmath18 torr and heated to 1000 @xmath17c under si flux to improve the surface conditions for graphene growth .",

    "these geometries have the advantage with respect to the conventional _ s_- and _",
    "p_-polarizations used in previous studies  @xcite , to measure the whole two - dimensional variation of the intensity maps around a singular ( dirac ) point and not just the intensity distributions along two characteristic lines in momentum space .",
    "this aspect becomes particularly relevant for some experimental conditions , e.g. , photon energy and sample orientation ( i.e. , the mixture of light polarizations ) , when the intensity maps ( or initial electronic states ) are neither symmetric nor anti - symmetric with respect to the reflection plane . under this condition in fact , the conventional notations would not give appropriate information on the symmetry of the initial states .",
    "figures  [ fig2](c ) and  [ fig2](d ) show the experimental photoelectron intensity maps at the fermi level , @xmath23 , versus the two - dimensional wavevector * k * for single - layer graphene , for the two polarization geometries . here",
    ", @xmath23 is 0.4  ev above the dirac point energy , @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the main feature in the intensity maps of both geometries is an almost circular fermi surface centered at the k point as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and  [ fig2](d ) , as expected for a conical dispersion .",
    "this is in good agreement with a recent polarization - dependent arpes study on single - layer graphene when using photons with energy lower than 52 ev  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly we find that the the angular intensity distribution is quite different for the two polarizations : for the x - polarization geometry , the minimum intensity position is in the first brillouin zone , whereas for the y - polarization geometry , the maximum intensity position is in the first brillouin zone , suggesting a @xmath7 rotation of the maximum intensity in the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane around the k point upon rotating the light polarization by @xmath0 , from x to y ( see the white arrows ) .",
    "the exact rotation angle is extracted from the direct comparison between the raw momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2](e ) and the angular dependence of the photoelectron intensity maps integrated over the radial direction around the * k * point in fig .",
    "[ fig2](f ) .",
    "there is an overall shift of the intensity maxima ( minima ) by @xmath27 upon changing the light polarization from x ( black solid line ) to y ( black dashed line ) , although the latter appears to be slightly shifted by @xmath28 with respect to @xmath7 . as we will show later ,",
    "this is due to the presence of a finite polarization component along the @xmath25 direction in our experimental geometry .",
    "we note that not only the angular position of the intensity maximum , but also the absolute value of it changes upon changing light polarization .",
    "the maximum intensity ratio from experiments is x - polarized / y - polarized=21.4 .",
    "however , this number itself is not very meaningful , because the measured arpes intensity is affected by the difference in the experimental geometries for x- and y - polarized lights ( the difference in the out - of - plane component of light polarization , photon flux per unit area , etc .",
    ", which are the factors that can not be controlled to be the same in different experimental geometries ) . on the other hand",
    ", the ratio from our theory that will be discussed later provides x - polarized / y - polarized=0.83 , assuming that the experimental parameters for two geometries are the same except for the in - plane light polarization .    a similar study on bernal stacked double - layer graphene reveals a strong and complicated momentum- , band- , and polarization - dependence as shown in figs .  [ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) , that is qualitatively different from that of single - layer graphene .",
    "like single - layer graphene , the double - layer sample is slightly @xmath10 doped  @xcite , therefore , only three of the four @xmath7 bands are occupied and hence detectable with arpes as shown in the cartoon of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the most prominent feature is that , when the light polarization is changed from x to y , the maximum intensity positions around the k point in the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane are rotated by @xmath29 ( see white arrows at @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the single - layer case where the rotation is @xmath27 as seen from the raw mdcs in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and the photoelectron intensity maps integrated over the radial direction around the * k * point shown in fig .",

    "[ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only models in the literature describing the polarization - dependence of the arpes intensity in graphite @xcite and graphene @xcite are substantially different from our results .",
    "previous studies , in fact , predict a small polarization - dependence  @xcite and no polarization - dependence  @xcite of the photoelectron intensity maps , respectively . therefore , to be able to reproduce our experimental findings and understand what lies behind this nontrivial polarization dependence , we have developed a new model .",
    "in particular , we first consider the hamiltonian using the tight - binding model based on the @xmath30 orbital of each carbon atom using two parameters : @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the in - plane nearest - neighbor ( a - b or a@xmath33-b@xmath33 ) and the inter - layer vertical ( b - a@xmath33 ) hopping integrals , respectively , as schematically drawn in fig .",

    "this quantity plays a crucial role in determining the arpes intensity of double - layer graphene as will be discussed later and also of multi - layer graphene as previously reported  @xcite .",

    "[ fig5](d ) , because both the intensity maxima of single- and double - layer graphene occur near @xmath134 = @xmath7 .",
    "we have shown that , when the light polarization is rotated by @xmath0 , the maximum intensity position in @xmath135 in the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane of single- and double - layer graphene is rotated by @xmath3 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 for single- and double - layer graphene , respectively .",
    "the physical meaning of these rotations , whose origins rests on the phase factor @xmath138 of the sublattice amplitude of the wavefunctions  @xcite , becomes clear upon a complete circulation of * q * around the dirac point k ( @xmath139 ) , which directly gives a berry s phase @xmath140  @xcite .",
    "recently the berry s phase interpretation of @xmath10  @xcite has been given by a different interpretation in terms of pseudospin winding number  @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath141 enters in @xmath135 in the form of either @xmath142 or @xmath143 with some constant @xmath144 , demonstrates that the matrix elements directly contain information on the berry s phase .",
    "the rotation of light polarization gives an additional phase @xmath0 to the phase factor , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the photoelectron intensity @xmath146 is modified accordingly from @xmath147 or @xmath148 upon the rotation of light polarization by @xmath0 , i.e. , the @xmath3 rotation of @xmath135 .",
    "this prediction is exactly realized in our experimental results .",
    "the power of our method is that it can be extended in a straightforward way to other materials with berry s phase @xmath149 ( not necessarily  @xmath7 or  @xmath8 ) . in this case , the photoemission intensities for x- and y - polarization geometries are given by @xmath150 and @xmath151 , where @xmath144 is a system - dependent constant .",
    "the important feature is that the rotation of light polarization by @xmath0 results in a rotation of intensity maxima by @xmath3 for a system with @xmath149 regardless of the constant @xmath144 .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated here that the berry s phase can directly be measured from polarization - dependent arpes .",
    "unlike methods based on magneto - transport experiments  @xcite , our new method has three important advantages .",
    "( i ) the berry s phase of a specific electronic band can be measured , because arpes has the angle - resolving power and also because one can set up a tight - binding hamiltonian focussing on only the electronic states of interest : those two results can directly be compared with each other .",
    "( ii ) due to the angle - resolving power , the measured result is free from valley degeneracy for the case of graphene .",
    "( iii ) our method does not need electric gating , which is essential for the transport measurements .",
    "another important finding of our study is that we can directly extract , for the first time , the sign and the absolute magnitude of the inter - orbital hopping integrals ( iohis ) between non - equivalent localized orbitals of a tight - binding hamiltonian from experiment . until now ,",
    "in fact , the sign determination of an iohi has resorted no to any experimental method , but to _ ab initio _ calculations , e.g. , using maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite . in order to understand an ambiguity related with the experimental sign determination",
    ", we take the simplest one - dimensional example , and extend the discussion to a more complicated tight - binding model of graphitic systems than the one described previously .",
    "we consider simple tight - binding models having _ s_-like localized states , the values of which are all positive in real space ( we can arbitrarily set this gauge without losing generality . ) if there is only one localized orbital per unit cell in a one - dimensional tight - binding model as drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , the energy bandstructure varies with the sign of the iohi @xmath152 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "hence , the sign of iohis between `` equivalent '' orbitals can always be trivially determined  @xcite .    .",
    "( b ) calculated electron energy band structure of the system depicted in ( a ) with different choices for the sign of @xmath152 .",
    "( c ) schematic of a one - dimensional crystal having two _ nonequivalent _",
    "_ s_-type orbitals per unit cell ( i.e. , having different on - site energies ) .",
    "we assume that all the distances between the centers of the nearest neighbor orbitals are the same and hence the corresponding hopping integrals , denoted by @xmath153 .",
    "( d ) calculated electronic band structure of the system depicted in * c * with different choices for the sign of @xmath153 . ]    however , if we consider the case where there are two non - equivalent localized orbitals @xmath154 and @xmath155 whose value in real space is positive and if we denote the iohi between the nearest neighboring orbitals by @xmath153 as drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) , the actual band structure is invariant when we change the sign of @xmath153 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) . therefore ,",
    "even when the actual electronic band structure is empirically determined , the sign of @xmath153 can not be determined . in general , an empirical tight - binding model with more than one orbital per unit cell has this sign ambiguity problem for iohis between `` non - equivalent '' orbitals , thus preventing an experimental measurement of iohi from just the energy band dispersions .",
    "we could understand this degeneracy as follows .",
    "if we denote the bloch sums of the two localized orbitals by @xmath156 and @xmath157 , the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath14 using this basis set reads @xmath158 note here that the matrix elements @xmath159 , in which @xmath160 , involve not only the on - site or nearest - neighbor hopping processes but also all the other possible hopping processes .",
    "now , it is obvious that the following hamiltonian @xmath161 has exactly the same eigenvalues as @xmath162 : @xmath163 what we have done by going from @xmath162 to @xmath161 is to change the sign of the iohi between the two non - equivalent localized orbitals . in fact",
    ", the two matrices @xmath162 and @xmath161 are related by a unitary transform , which does not change the eigenvalues of a matrix , @xmath164 with @xmath165 on the other hand , if we change the signs of the diagonal matrix elements @xmath166 , in which @xmath167 , we get a different eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "thus , there is no ambiguity in the sign of the iohi between equivalent orbitals .",
    "this simple example illustrates that one can not determine the signs of the iohis between non - equivalent orbitals just by looking at the measured electron energy bandstructure .",
    "the tight - binding model for double - layer graphene that we used in our calculations is based on the @xmath74 orbitals of carbon atoms with two parameters : @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the nearest - neighbor in - plane and the vertical inter - layer hopping integrals , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the well - known slonczewski - weiss - mcclure model , respectively  @xcite , and we have used @xmath168  ev and @xmath169  ev  @xcite .",
    "the photoemission intensity map in the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane is strongly dependent on the signs of both @xmath31 and @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "because the four different choices of the signs produce exactly the same electronic band structure , it has not been known from experiments which choice of the signs of the iohis is physically correct , although the absolute values have been experimentally estimated  @xcite .",
    "this sign - ambiguity problem still exists even when we include more complicated hopping processes in the model , especially the non - vertical inter - layer hopping integrals @xmath170 and @xmath171 , there still exist unitary transforms that leave the energy eigenvalues unchanged . in a tight - binding model having four hopping integrals ( @xmath172 , @xmath35 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 ) , the following four different sets of parameters give exactly the same electron energy bandstructure : ( @xmath172 , @xmath35 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 ) , ( @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 ) , ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath170 , @xmath175 ) , and ( @xmath34 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath171 ) , assuming that the first set is composed of the values currently accepted and used when the swmc model is considered . in principle , there should be eight different sets of parameters giving the same energy bandstructure ; however , from our knowledge that the nearest - neighbor intralayer hopping integrals in different graphene layers are the same , we have reduced the number of candidates to four .",
    "this is also the reason why we considered only the four cases in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "we have shown that the choice of @xmath105 and @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) , reproduces the experimental results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) , thus experimentally determined the signs of these iohis .",
    "the signs of the iohis used for graphite in the conventional model  @xcite is indeed correct .",
    "previous theoretical study has also tried to determine the signs  @xcite , but inappropriate theoretical approaches ( as previously mentioned ) and the lack of full polarization - dependent experimental data have led to incorrect speculations , which do not agree with the conventional model  @xcite as well as our results .",
    "our method can generally be used to determine the sign of the hopping integrals in complicated materials such as cuprates as well as in simple materials such as gallium arsenide and one - dimensional crystals having two atoms per unit cell .",
    "we have shown that arpes can be used as a powerful tool to directly measure quantum phases such as the berry s phase of a specific electronic band in graphene with advantages compared to the interference type of measurements  @xcite which do not give any information on the band - specific berry s phase , and the sign of the hopping integral between non - equivalent orbitals , never measured for any material before .",
    "the experimental and theoretical procedures developed here can be applied in studying the electronic , transport , and quantum interference properties of a huge variety of materials .",
