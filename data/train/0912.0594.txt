    "the study of complex particle systems has given rise to some challenging issues  @xcite , in a mathematical point of view .",
    "one of the interesting problem is to understand how a collective behavior can emerge with only localized interactions .",
    "the vicsek model  @xcite has been proposed as a minimalist model describing the behavior of individuals inside animal societies such as fish schools or flocks of birds .",
    "it is a minimal version of a more complete and realistic model  @xcite based on three zones ( of repulsion , alignment , and attraction ) .",
    "the vicsek model only considers the alignment behavior , getting around the problem of confining the particles in the same region by imposing spatial periodicity ( particles move on the flat torus ) .",
    "all the particles have constant speed and synchronously update their direction according to their neighbors , their new orientation vector being given by the mean direction ( subjected to some angular noise ) of all particles at distance less than a given radius .",
    "as the noise decreases ( or the density increases ) , one can observe a phenomenon of phase transition , from a regime of disordered particles , to an ordered phase with strong correlations between orientations of particles  @xcite .",
    "two main difficulties arise when we try to derive a macroscopic limit of this individual based model .",
    "first of all , the system is discrete in time : the time step is fixed , and the model is not built in the goal of letting it tend to zero .",
    "the second problem is that , except for the total mass , there is no obvious conservation relation , so a good candidate for a macroscopic model would probably be a non - conservative system of partial differential equations , but we lack conservation relations to obtain any equation other than the conservation of mass .    in  @xcite , degond and motsch",
    "have proposed an approach to handle these two complications .",
    "first , they provide a time - continuous version of the individual based model , introducing a rate of relaxation towards the local mean direction , under the form of a new parameter  @xmath0 , which can be viewed as a frequency of interaction between a particle and its neighbors .",
    "it is therefore possible to derive a kinetic mean - field limit of this model .",
    "then they develop a method , defining the notion of generalized collisional invariants , which allows to derive the formal limit of this kinetic mean - field model , at large scale in space and time .",
    "this continuum limit is a non - conservative system of pde for the local mass and the local orientation .",
    "moreover , this system is proved to be hyperbolic .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to confirm the ability of this type of macroscopic model to describe the large scale dynamics of systems of self - propelled particles with orientation alignment , and to show that the notion of generalized collisional invariants is well adapted to derive this model from the microscopic mechanism of alignment .",
    "this was shown in  @xcite for a different type of alignment , based on the curvature control ( for a model of displacement introduced in  @xcite , designed to fit biological experiments  @xcite ) : the method which uses the generalized collisional invariants is successful to derive a macroscopic model which is the same as the `` vicsek hydrodynamics '' of  @xcite , but for the definition of the coefficients in the model .",
    "we will show that this is also the case when we slightly modify the individual model , in order to be more coherent with some numerical observations , and to model the influence of an angle of vision .",
    "one of the properties of the macroscopic model of  @xcite which fails to represent the numerical observations is that the local equilibria have a constant order parameter .",
    "this order parameter is indeed only related to the ratio between the frequency  @xmath0 of interaction and the intensity  @xmath1 of the noise . in numerical experiments on the vicsek model  @xcite ,",
    "the order parameter depends on the local density of particles : one can observe , at large time , formation of travelling bands of high density , strongly ordered , moving through a disordered area of low density .",
    "the first refinement on the model will be to define the local density  @xmath2 in the particular model as the mean number of particles in a neighboring area , and to make the parameters  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 depend on  @xmath2 . in a modelling point of view , this could be interpreted as the fact that , due to social pressure for example , it is more likely to move and update the direction when there is a large number of particles around ( so  @xmath0 increases with  @xmath2 ) , and that the fluctuation in the estimation of the mean velocity is smaller when a lot of particles are taken in account in the neighborhood ( so  @xmath1 decreases with  @xmath2 , see for example the way the vectorial noise is defined in  @xcite ) .",
    "this dependence on local parameters for the noise parameter has been introduced in other models of collective behavior  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    ", the parameter  @xmath0 does also depend on the angle between one particle direction and its target direction . for convenience",
    ", we will not take this in account for most results but , in some simple cases , computations have been done and will be given in appendix .",
    "another property of the mean - field model of  @xcite is that the type of local equilibrium for the rescaled model is unique .",
    "the loss of this uniqueness could play a role to understand the formation of patterns such as the travelling bands  @xcite , and in some models of rod - like particles , we have indeed bistability in a certain regime  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case here , and we will see in section  [ elements ] that we still have a unique kind of equilibrium associated to a local density  @xmath3 and a local orientation  @xmath4 .",
    "the second refinement is to take into account the influence of an `` angle of vision '' in the model . in the original vicsek model , the target orientation for a given particle",
    "is chosen to be the mean orientation of the neighbors located in a ball centered on this particle .",
    "we will use here a more general kernel of observation which can be non - isotropic .",
    "this refinement has been proposed in various models of swarming  @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the formal macroscopic limit of this model take the same form as the previous `` vicsek hydrodynamic model '' of  @xcite , consisting in a conservation equation for the local density of particles , and an evolution equation for the mean orientation , which is not conservative ( the velocity is constrained to be on the unit sphere ) .",
    "this system of pde is quite similar to the euler equations for gas dynamics , but presents some specific issues , for example there are two different velocities of propagation .",
    "the difference between our model and the macroscopic model of  @xcite relies on the definition of the coefficients of this model , and on the fact that they depend on the local density .",
    "this last feature allows the model to lose the property of hyperbolicity .    in section  [ presentation ] , we present the individual model and the final macroscopic model , focusing on how the two refinements are taken in account , and what are the consequences at the macroscopic level .    in section  [ elements ] , we provide elements of the derivation of this macroscopic model , following the method of  @xcite , but emphasizing the details which are specific to this study .",
    "we also give the method in a general  @xmath5-dimensional framework ( previously the method was only done in three dimensions ) .",
    "the case of the dimension  @xmath6 is special , since we are able to give an explicit expression of the coefficients .    in section  [ properties ] , we study the properties of the macroscopic model . we prove that when one of the coefficients is negative , then the system is not hyperbolic .",
    "we describe the region of hyperbolicity for a system which depends only on one space variable , and we discuss the influence of `` angle of vision '' .",
    "finally , in section  [ asymptotics ] , we provide a general method which gives an asymptotic expansion of the coefficients in any dimension , in the limit of a small or a large concentration parameter . with these expansions ,",
    "we are able to study the qualitative influence of the `` angle of vision '' in the final macroscopic model , and to give examples for which the hyperbolicity is indeed lost .",
    "we start by presenting the individual - based model and the continuum model we obtain in the limit of a large number of particles , when observed at large scale , in space and time .",
    "elements of the derivation of this macroscopic model will be given in section  [ elements ] .      here",
    ", we briefly recall the time - continuous version of the vicsek model , and introduce how we take into account the anisotropy of observation and the dependence on the local density for the rate of relaxation and the intensity of the noise .",
    "we consider a system of  @xmath7 particles with positions  @xmath8 in  @xmath9 ( with  @xmath10 ) and orientations  @xmath11 in the unit sphere  @xmath12 , which we will simply write  @xmath13 .    for each particle , we first define a local mean orientation  @xmath14 ( considered as a target direction ) and a local density  @xmath15 . in the original model of vicsek",
    "@xcite , the mean orientation  @xmath14 is computed on all the neighbors within a given radius  @xmath16 . here",
    "we take the mean according to a kernel of observation  @xmath17 , which can be more general than the indicator function of the ball of radius  @xmath16 , as in the time - continuous version of  @xcite .",
    "the kernel therein depends only on the distance between the given particle and a given neighbor , so the refinement here is that it can also depend on ( the cosine of ) the angle between the orientation of the first particle and the right line joining the two particles : @xmath18    for example , to take into account only the neighbors located `` in front '' , and within a given radius  @xmath16 , of one particle , the kernel would be  @xmath19 .",
    "we proceed in an analogous way to compute the local density  @xmath15 , which may use another kernel  @xmath20 : @xmath21    we now turn to the dynamics of the particle system .",
    "the  @xmath22 particle moves at constant speed  @xmath23 , following its orientation  @xmath11 .",
    "this last one relax towards the mean orientation  @xmath14 of its neighbors , with rate  @xmath0 ( depending in the local mean density  @xmath15 ) , under the constraint that  @xmath11 is of norm  @xmath23 .",
    "finally , this orientation  @xmath11 is subjected to a brownian motion ( see  @xcite for more details on how to define such an object on a riemannian manifold , such as the unit sphere here ) of intensity  @xmath1 , which will also depend on the density  @xmath15 .",
    "the model takes then the form of  @xmath24 coupled stochastic differential equations , which have to be understood in the stratonovich sense : @xmath25 where  @xmath26 are independent standard brownian motions on  @xmath9 .",
    "here we denote by  @xmath27 the projection on the plane orthogonal to  @xmath11 , that is to say  @xmath28 .",
    "this projection is necessary to keep  @xmath11 on the unit sphere .",
    "the term  @xmath29 can also be written  @xmath30 , where  @xmath31 is the tangential gradient on the unit sphere .",
    "the deterministic part of the sde   can then be written  @xmath32 , which is indeed a relaxation towards  @xmath14 ( where the function  @xmath33 reaches its maximum ) , with rate  @xmath34 .    since the local density  @xmath2 only appears through the functions  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 , we can assume the following normalization for the kernel  @xmath20 : @xmath35 this normalization condition ( which does not depend on  @xmath36 ) means that the density is chosen to be  @xmath23 in the limit of a uniform distribution of the  @xmath7 particles in a region of unit volume .",
    "this is not necessary to take a similar condition for the kernel  @xmath17 , since  @xmath14 , defined at equation  @xmath37 , is independent of such a normalization .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the relaxation coefficient  @xmath0 depends on ( the cosine of ) the angle between the orientation of one particle and the target direction , in order to take into account the `` ability to turn ''",
    ". this would amount to replace  @xmath34 by  @xmath38 in  . with our new features here , this would involve many more computations , but , following exactly the same method , this leads to the same conclusion . for simplicity here , we will work without this dependence .",
    "we will only present the final results with this dependence in some special cases , and add remarks to explain the difference in the steps of the derivation of the macroscopic model .",
    "numerical simulations tend to show that this time - continuous individual based model present the same behavior at large scale as the discrete one ( for example the formation of bands , as in  @xcite ) , in the case where  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are constant , and the observation kernel is isotropic , as in  @xcite .",
    "we can expect to observe the same behavior , even when  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 depend on the local density  @xmath2 .",
    "more precise investigations on the numerical comparison between the original discrete and the present time - continuous dynamical systems are in progress .      in this paper , following the approach of  @xcite , we derive , from the particle dynamics  - introduced in the previous subsection , the following continuum model , the functions  @xmath39 and  @xmath40 describing the average density and particle direction at a given point  @xmath41 : @xmath42 where the functions  @xmath43 ,  @xmath44 , and  @xmath45 will be specified later on : see   and  - .",
    "this system of first order partial differential equations shows similarities with the euler system of isothermal compressible gases , but also some important differences .",
    "equation   is the conservation of mass : the density  @xmath3 moves through direction  @xmath4 with velocity  @xmath46 .",
    "we will see that this velocity , taking values between  @xmath47 and  @xmath23 , plays the role of an order parameter : when the directions of the particles are strongly correlated ( close to  @xmath4 ) , density moves with velocity close to  @xmath23 .",
    "this order parameter depends only on the ratio between  @xmath48 ( the alignment strength ) and  @xmath49 ( the noise intensity ) .",
    "equation   describes the evolution of the direction  @xmath4 , the norm of which is constrained to be constant ( the projection  @xmath50 insures that the dynamics take place on the hyperplane orthogonal to  @xmath4 ) .",
    "this constraint implies that the equation is not conservative which is the counterpart of the fact that , at the microscopic level , the only conservative quantity is the mass .",
    "the perturbations of this vector travel with velocity  @xmath51 , influenced by a term playing the role of pressure due to the density , of intensity  @xmath52 .",
    "it is important to see that in general ( and contrary to the classical euler system ) , the two convection speeds  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 are different , which means that the perturbations on the mean orientation do not travel at the same velocity as the `` fluid '' .",
    "this macroscopic model is the same as the `` vicsek hydrodynamics '' of  @xcite , except for the definitions of these speeds  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 , and of the parameter  @xmath45 .",
    "this confirms the ability of this model to describe the global dynamics of systems of self - propelled particles with constant speed and alignment interactions ( this was also the result of  @xcite ) .    however , the parameters depend here on the density  @xmath3 , and their expressions are slightly different ( due to this dependence and to the anisotropy of the kernel of observation ) .",
    "this leads to strong differences in their behavior , as we will see in section  [ properties ] , devoted to the investigation of the properties of  - .",
    "for example the parameter  @xmath45 can be negative , which implies the loss of hyperbolicity . and",
    "because of the non isotropy of the observation kernel , the convection speed  @xmath44 can take a large range of values , from negative if the kernel is strongly directed forward , to higher than  @xmath43 , if particles are more influenced by neighbors behind them than those in front of them ( this has been observed in locust migratory bands  @xcite , where the individuals have `` cannibalistic interactions '' and avoid to be eaten by those approaching from behind ) .",
    "this derivation proceeds like in  @xcite but there are significant differences due to the additional complexity . in this section ,",
    "we briefly recall the method of degond and motsch and will focus on the points which are specific to the present study .",
    "the derivation proceeds in several steps .",
    "the first one consists in writing a kinetic version of the particle dynamics .",
    "let  @xmath53 be the probability density of finding one particle at position  @xmath54 , orientation  @xmath36 and time  @xmath55 .",
    "the mean - field version of  - is given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 the first equation   is the so called kolmogorov ",
    "planck equation .",
    "the force term  @xmath58 corresponds to the orientation interaction .",
    "first of all , if there is no noise ( that is  @xmath59 in equations  - , which become ordinary differential equations ) , the formal derivation of this system is easy : the usual methodology shows that the empirical distribution ( see  @xcite ) satisfies the equation  , with  @xmath60 .",
    "difficulties appear when the noise is added .",
    "a method consisting in writing the bbgky hierarchy ( see  @xcite , applied to the cucker - smale model of self - propelled particles ) would not in that case reduce to a evolution equation involving only the one - particle and the two - particles distributions , since the interaction is not a sum of binary interactions .",
    "we could slightly change our model to make the interaction as a sum of binary interactions , replacing  @xmath14 by  @xmath61 ( defined in equation  ) in the system of particles  - . in that case",
    "the model present an interesting phenomenon of phase transition and is the subject of current work in collaboration with p. degond and j .- g .",
    "liu  @xcite ( the homogeneous version has been studied with him in  @xcite ) . in that case , writing the bbgky hierarchy and using exchangeability of particles gives a system of evolution equations , the first one involving only the one - particle and the two - particles distributions .",
    "the classical assumption of propagation of chaos amounts to consider the two - particles density as the tensor of the one - particle density  @xmath62 by itself ( in the limit of a large number of particles , two particles behave as if they were independent ) , and this gives exactly the evolution equation  .",
    "actually , it has been recently proved  @xcite that the mean - field limit of this model is the partial differential equation  , where  @xmath63 is replaced by  @xmath64 in the definition of the force  @xmath65 ( in the case where  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are constant ) .",
    "the main point to derive this limit is to adapt the classical theory of propagation of chaos  @xcite in a framework of stochastic analysis in a riemannian manifold ( the unit sphere in the present case ) .    in the case of a non - linear diffusion ,",
    "some results are given in  @xcite for other systems of self - propelled particles , under assumptions which would have to be adapted in our framework .",
    "we can expect to have conditions such as to be lipschitz for the function  @xmath66 , and to be lipschitz and bounded for the kernel  @xmath20 . since we use the stratonovich formulation in order to work on the unit sphere",
    ", we get the term  @xmath67 ( instead of  @xmath68 when the velocity  @xmath69 satisfies the sde in the usual it formulation , see the sections  @xmath70 and  @xmath71 of  @xcite for the correspondence ) .",
    "finally , when the drift is not under the average form , it is sometimes possible to get a mean - field limit , under regularity assumptions on the coefficients  @xcite , or with weaker assumptions , but assuming uniqueness of the solution of the mean - field model  @xcite .",
    "these results could to be adapted in the framework of stochastic differential equations on the sphere , but dealing with the singularity of  @xmath63 ( when  @xmath72 is close to zero ) seems to be slightly more complicated .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "it is however very reasonable that the limit of the particle system  - , when the number of particles is large , is given by the mean - field model  .",
    "so we start with this model as a base for the derivation of the continuum model",
    ". a rigorous proof of the derivation of such a mean - field model from the individual dynamics is left to future work .",
    "if we want to take into account some `` ability to turn '' , we just have to replace  @xmath73 by  @xmath74 .",
    "the next step consists in observing this system at large scale , in both space in time .",
    "the hydrodynamic scaling consists in the same rescaling for the time and space variable .",
    "we introduce a small parameter  @xmath75 and we set  @xmath76 , and  @xmath77 .",
    "we define  , and we rewrite the equation   in this new coordinates .",
    "the kinetic equation has the same form , with a factor  @xmath75 in front of each of the terms with space or time derivative : @xmath78 with @xmath79 where the local rescaled density and orientation are given by @xmath80 the important point is to realize that the average density  @xmath81 and orientation  @xmath82 now depend on  @xmath75 , and can be easily expanded in terms of  @xmath75 , the non - locality only appearing at high order . omitting the primes for simplicity",
    ", we have the following expansions , the proofs of which are given in lemma  [ lemma_expansion ] of appendix  [ annex_lemma_expansion ] : @xmath83 where  @xmath84 and  @xmath85 are the local density and mean orientation associated to the function  @xmath86 ( these quantities , depending only on the space and time variables , are related to the first moments with respect to the variable  @xmath87 ) given by @xmath88 and the constants  @xmath89 and  @xmath90 depend only on the observation kernels  @xmath17 and  @xmath91 .",
    "these constants are positive if the kernel is directed forward , and the more acute the `` angle of vision '' , the bigger the constant related to the kernel .",
    "now we can introduce these expansions in the mean - field model , and after some easy algebra , the rescaled model can be written in the form @xmath92 where  @xmath93 ,  @xmath94 and  @xmath95 are the operators given by the following equations ( where  @xmath96 and  @xmath97 are the derivatives of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 with respect to  @xmath3 ) : @xmath98 notice that the operator  @xmath93 ( giving the only term of order  @xmath47 in  @xmath75 ) only acts on the variable  @xmath87 , and the study of its properties will be important for the following .",
    "if  @xmath0 also depends on  @xmath99 , the expression of the operator  @xmath93 is the same with  @xmath100 instead of  @xmath101 .",
    "but then the expressions of  @xmath94 and  @xmath102 complicate in a significant way , since there are also terms with the derivative of  @xmath0 with respect to this second variable .",
    "now we are ready to study this system when  @xmath103 .",
    "this is the main step , where we give the link between the continuum limit  - and the rescaled kinetic equation   of the particle dynamics .",
    "the limit when  @xmath104 of  @xmath86 is given ( formally ) by  @xmath105 where  @xmath106 is the total mass of  @xmath107 and  @xmath108 its mean orientation : @xmath109 where  @xmath110 is a given function of  @xmath111 and  @xmath112 which will be specified later on ( see  ) .",
    "furthermore ,  @xmath113 and  @xmath114 satisfy the following system of first order partial differential equations : @xmath115 where the convection speeds  @xmath43 ,  @xmath44 and the parameter  @xmath45 depend on  @xmath3 .",
    "their expressions will be given in this section ( see   and  - ) .",
    "[ theo_limit ]    the method to obtain this result follows closely  @xcite , and is only summarized here .",
    "we will focus on the details which are specific to this study .",
    "the first important point is to determine the null space  @xmath116 of  @xmath93 , since it contains the limits of  .",
    "we find , as in  @xcite , that it is a  @xmath5-dimensional manifold consisting of functions analogous to maxwellian distributions in the classical boltzmann theory : @xmath117 where @xmath118 the main difference with  @xcite is the dependence on  @xmath3 for this equilibrium in a nonlinear way , coming from the dependence of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 on  @xmath3 .",
    "this will result in additional terms in the computations , and so in additional terms in the expressions of the constants in the macroscopic model .",
    "the normalization constant  @xmath119 depends only on  @xmath120 ( not on  @xmath4 ) and so the total mass of  @xmath121 is  @xmath23 and its mean direction is  @xmath4 , that is to say  @xmath122 and  @xmath123 .",
    "indeed we can easily compute the flux  @xmath124 of this equilibrium , defined by  , and we get : @xmath125 where for any function  @xmath126 , the notation  @xmath127 stands for the mean of the function  @xmath128 against the density  @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath129 notice that  @xmath127 depends only on  @xmath120 , not on  @xmath4 : @xmath130    in the case where  @xmath0 depends on  @xmath3 and  @xmath111 , we have to replace in all this point  @xmath131 by  @xmath132 , where  @xmath133 .      the second important point is the determination of generalized collisional invariants . indeed , since there is no other conservation relation than the conservation of mass , the collision invariants reduce to the constants , and the integration of the equation against these invariants only gives one equation , which is not sufficient to describe the behavior of the equilibrium ( which lives on a  @xmath5-dimensional manifold ) .",
    "the main idea in  @xcite was to overcome this problem with a generalization of the concept of collisional invariants .",
    "a collision invariant is a function  @xmath134 such that for all function  @xmath62 of  @xmath87 , the integration of  @xmath135 against  @xmath134 is zero .",
    "so we ask for a generalized invariant to satisfy this definition only for a restricted subset of functions  @xmath62 . in the case where the dependence on  @xmath3 in the equilibria is linear ,",
    "restricting to all functions with a given orientation  @xmath4 is sufficient to obtain the remaining equation .",
    "here we also have to restrict to functions with a given density too ( actually , we impose a given  @xmath136 ) .",
    "we will have then a set of generalized coefficients indexed by  @xmath137 and  @xmath138 .",
    "more precisely , to have a good definition , we have to work with linear operators ( this point has been mentioned in  @xcite , since the result given in  @xcite , with the definition therein , was slightly incorrect ) .",
    "we first define the linear operator  @xmath139 by @xmath140 , \\label{l_kappa_omega}\\ ] ] and then the generalized collisional invariants  @xmath141 ( associated to  @xmath142 and  @xmath137 ) as the following vector space : @xmath143 we remark that the operator  @xmath135 can be written as  @xmath144 .",
    "hence , for any generalized collisional invariant  @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 and this is the only property of generalized collisional invariants we will need in the following .",
    "the computation of the set of generalized collisional invariants has been done in  @xcite in dimension  @xmath147 .",
    "we give here the general result in any dimension .",
    "structure of the generalized collisional invariants .",
