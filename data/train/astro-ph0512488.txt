    "blue stragglers ( bss ) are stars lying above the main sequence ( ms ) turnoff region in colour - magnitude diagrams , a region where , if the bss had been normal single stars , they should already have evolved away from the main sequence @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of bss in different environments .",
    "* bss may be stars formed later than the rest of the cluster or association .",
    "though this may well happen in some regions with sequential star formation , in many clusters there are no stellar sequences connecting the bss with the turn - off , arguing against a second epoch of star formation .",
    "* bss might be evolved stars back in the blue region of the hr diagram after a red supergiant phase .",
    "however , abundances of nitrogen in blue stragglers are much lower than those predicted by models for stars in blue loops @xcite .",
    "* bss may be stars that , for some reason , have evolved bluewards . in particular _ homogeneous evolution _ has been proposed as a mechanism that can result in blueward evolution for very high ( near - critical ) initial rotational velocity @xcite .",
    "however there is no strong _ a priori _ reason to believe that many such extreme rotators will be formed .",
    "* bss may be formed by coalescence of two stars .",
    "this mechanism requires a high stellar density environment .",
    "though it is probably the major channel for the formation of bss in globular cluster , it is unlikely to be able to explain bss in ob associations . * bss result from mass exchange in close binaries .",
    "examples of this process abound amongst massive binaries ( see review by negueruela in these proceedings ) .",
    "therefore this channel must contribute some bss in young clusters and associations .",
    "while the properties of bss in globular clusters have been the object of many studies , the mechanisms for forming bss in young open clusters have deserved little attention .",
    "the most relevant works are those of @xcite and @xcite",
    "as part of our programme to fully characterise a sample of young open clusters , we have obtained spectroscopy of large numbers of stars in the young open clusters ngc  663 , ngc  869 and ngc  3766 , and the moderately older clusters ngc  6649 and ic  4725 .",
    "we obtained spectra for 38 bright stars in @xmath0 persei and the immediately surrounding area on 2003 november 15th , using the 4.2-m wht at the la palma observatory , equipped with the isis spectrograph and the r600b grating ( 0.4  / pixel ) .",
    "in addition , 17 members were observed with the 2.5-m int , also at the la palma observatory , with the ids spectrograph and the r900v grating ( 0.6  / pixel ) , in july 2003 .",
    "spectra for 140 members of ngc 663 were obtained in two runs during october / november 2002 , one with the int+ids and the r400v grating ( 1.2  / pixel ) and the other one with the 1.93-m telescope at observatoire de haute - provence and the carlec spectrograph and the 300 ln / mm grating ( 1.8  / pixel ) .",
    "spectra of the brightest members of ngc 6649 were obtained with the wht+isis and the r300b grating ( 0.9  / pixel ) on 2004 may 20th .",
    "finally observations of ngc 3766 and ic 4725 were obtained in may 2004 with the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , equipped with emmi in the longslit spectrograph mode .",
    "in order to detect bss in our sample of open clusters , we use two types of hr diagram .",
    "when strmgren photometry of a sufficient large sample exists , we use the observational @xmath1 diagram for the determination of cluster ages .",
    "if we have spectroscopy of a large number of members , we can also construct a `` theoretical '' hr diagram using the following procedure : from our spectra , we determine accurate spectral types and then take the corresponding @xmath2 from the tabulation of @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the individual reddening for each star , using precision @xmath3 ( and @xmath4 where available ) photometry from the literature and @xmath5 from 2mass .",
    "the photometry and the kurucz model corresponding to the spectral type are used as input for the @xmath6 code for parameterised modelling and characterisation of photometry and spectroscopy implemented by @xcite , which estimates the reddening .",
    "after dereddening , we correct for the adopted distance modulus and transform to @xmath7 using the calibration of bc for a given spectral type given by @xcite .",
    "all the isochrones shown are from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : phot3766 ]    we have strmgren photometry for 55 stars in this cluster from @xcite and @xcite . the cluster hr digram ( fig .",
    "1 ) clearly demonstrates the age of the cluster , @xmath8myr .",
    "this age is fully consistent with the spectral types of the stars around the ms turn - off ( b2v ) .",
    "however , there is an object with @xmath9 lying clearly to the left of the isochrone .",
    "this star ( s5 ) is located at the very centre of the cluster .",
    "its spectral type b0.7iii confirms that it is earlier than any other member , but also that its parameters ( distance and reddening ) are those of a cluster member .",
    "we thus conclude that this object is a blue straggler in ngc  3766 .",
    "the other object marked with an open square ( s326 , bf  cen ) also is a very interesting case .",
    "its spectrum clearly shows that it is a double - line spectroscopic binary .",
    "@xcite found that it is an eclipsing binary with a 3.7-d orbital period .",
    "the primary component is a b1.5v star with 8.7@xmath10 and 5@xmath11 , while the secondary component is a b6iii star with 3.8@xmath10 and 7@xmath11 .",
    "the latter rotates synchronously , while the primary rotates much faster , implying that it is a post - mass transfer system .",
    "taking into account that the secondary contributes a substantial amount of light , the b1.5v star alone would be located to the left of the turn - off and be a mild blue straggler .",
    "this is a good example of a blue straggler created by mass transfer .      in the observational photometric diagram of ngc  869",
    ", there are many stars to the left of the ms turn - off @xcite .",
    "this is also evident in the theoretical hr diagram ( fig .  2 ) built from our spectral types and the photometry from @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of the stars leaving the main sequence ( b1.5v ) are compatible with an age of @xmath12myr",
    ". however , a large number of evolved stars lying to the left of the turn - off have spectral types indicating higher masses .",
    "[ fig : phot869 ]    we can distinguish two kinds of bss .",
    "most of them concentrate around the @xmath13 isochrone .",
    "though @xcite show that many of these objects are not very fast rotators _ now _ , the fact that all of them are evolved from the ms leads us to speculate that their position to the left of the turn - off may be related to initial fast rotation .",
    "a few other bss occupy positions indicating much higher masses .",
    "the b2ia and b3ia supergiants are amongst the most massive b - type supergiants in the sample of @xcite , with evolutionary masses of the order of @xmath14",
    ". both types of bss are present at the cluster core and most of them are certainly cluster members .",
    "[ fig : two ]    a similar effect , well - defined ms turn - off and most of the evolved stars lying to the left , can also be seen in two other relatively massive clusters , perhaps slightly younger than ngc  869 , for which abundant data exist in the literature : ngc 3293 and ngc 4755 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "in these three open clusters and many others of similar age , there are b - type supergiants lying well above the corresponding isochrones for the cluster .",
    "their progenitors are stars more massive than @xmath15 and therefore they are necessarily bss in clusters older than @xmath16myr .      from the observational photometric diagram , the cluster has an age @xmath8myr , again in good agreement with the spectral types of stars close to the turn - off ( b2v ) .",
    "we find two obvious photometric bss located near the cluster core ( s4 and s30 ) .",
    "their spectral types ( b1iii in both cases ) support their bs nature and their cluster membership .",
    "our spectra reveal at least three other spectroscopic bss which were saturated in our photometry .",
    "they include the o9.5v star s162 and , of particular interest , ls i + 61@xmath17 235 ( s194 ) , a b0.5ive star in the be / x - ray binary rx  j0146.9 + 6121 .",
    "the age of this cluster is @xmath18myr @xcite , confirmed by the study of the characteristics of the double mode cepheid member v367 sct .",
    "we build the theoretical hr diagram from our spectra and the photometry of @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of the brightest blue members show good agreement with this age , presenting a ms turn - off around b4v ( fig .",
    "there are two obvious bss , the brightest of which is a b1iiie star ( s9 ) , unambiguously associated with an _ xmm - newton _ x - ray source .",
    "this object appears to be a low luminosity be / x - ray binary or a member of the class of @xmath19-cas - like x - ray sources ( see contribution by motch et al . in these proceedings ) .",
    "the age of this cluster has been set at @xmath20myr by several different studies and is also constrained by the presence of a classical cepheid , u sgr . from the spectral types , we find the ms turn - off around b6v , in good agreement with this age , but leaving at least four evolved bss , three of which are be stars ( see fig .  4 ) .    [",
    "fig : dia6649 ]",
    "though the sample of open clusters for which a detailed analysis has been made is still quite small , we observe the following interesting trends :    * blue stragglers are found in all open clusters surveyed * in clusters @xmath21myr old , most evolved stars appear too massive for these ages .",
    "in particular , many of these clusters contain ia and iab supergiants , which must be descended from stars with @xmath22 according to all theoretical evolutionary paths .",
    "such massive stars have lifetimes @xmath23myr @xcite , rendering all these supergiants bss . * among clusters younger than @xmath8myr ,",
    "very few bss are be stars .",
    "* from the data on ic  4725 and ngc  6649 , incomplete samples in ngc  2516 and ic  2488 and data in the literature @xcite , it would seem that most bss in clusters in the @xmath24  myr range are be stars . *",
    "our data suggest that a non - negligible fraction of bss in moderately young open clusters are formed by mass transfer in a close binary ( x - ray sources in ngc  663 and ngc  6649 , eclipsing binary in ngc  3766 ) , but not all bss are binaries , making it unlikely that this might be the only channel . *",
    "likely different mechanisms are dominant at different ages .",
