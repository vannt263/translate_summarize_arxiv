    "fundamental quantum many - body systems involve the interaction of bosonic and/or fermionic particles .",
    "the spin of a particle makes it behave very differently at ultracold temperatures below the degeneracy temperature .",
    "there are thus fundamental differences between the properties of bosons and fermions .",
    "however , as bosons are not subject to the pauli exclusion principle , they can collapse under suitable conditions into the same quantum groundstate  the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "remarkably , even a small attraction between two fermions with opposite spin states and momentum can lead to the formation of a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pair that has a bosonic nature .",
    "such bcs pairs can undergo the phenomenon of bec as temperature tends to absolute zero . over the past few decades , experimental achievements in trapping and cooling atomic gases",
    "have revealed the beautiful and subtle physics of the quantum world of ultracold atoms , see recent review articles @xcite .    in particular , recent experiments on ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms confined to one dimension ( 1d )",
    "have provided a better understanding of the quantum statistical and dynamical effects in quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "these atomic waveguide particles are tightly confined in two transverse directions and weakly confined in the axial direction .",
    "the transverse excitations are fully suppressed by the tight confinement . as a result",
    "the trapped atoms can be effectively characterised by a quasi-1d system , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d ] .",
    "the effective 1d inter - particle potential can be controlled in the whole interaction regime .",
    "in such a way , the 1d many - body systems ultimately relate to previously considered exactly solved models of interacting bosons and fermions .",
    "this has led to a fascinating interplay between exactly solved models and experimental developments in 1d .",
    "inspired by these developments , the study of integrable models has undergone a renaissance over the past decade .",
    "their study has become crucial to exploring and understanding the physics of quantum many - body systems .",
    "the study of bethe ansatz solvable models began when bethe ( 1931 ) introduced a particular form of wavefunction  the bethe ansatz ( ba )  to obtain the energy eigenspectrum of the 1d heisenberg spin chain .",
    "after laying in obscurity for decades , the ba emerged to underpin a diverse range of physical problems , from superconductors to string theory , see , e.g. , batchelor ( 2007 ) . for such exactly solved models ,",
    "the energy eigenspectrum of the model hamiltonian is obtained exactly in terms of the ba equations , from which physical properties can be derived via mathematical analysis . from 1931 to the early 1960s",
    "there were only a handful of papers on the ba , treating the passage to the thermodynamic limit and the extension to the anisotropic xxz heisenberg spin chain @xcite .",
    "yang and yang ( 1966a ) coined the term bethe s hypothesis and proved that bethe s solution was indeed the groundstate of the xxz spin chain @xcite .",
    "the next development was the exact solution of the 1d bose gas with delta - function interaction by lieb and liniger ( 1963 ) , which continues to have a tremendous impact in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "they diagonalised the hamiltonian and derived the groundstate energy of the model .",
    "this study was further extended to the excitations above the groundstate @xcite .",
    "mcguire ( 1964 ) considered the model in the context of quantum many - body scattering in which the condition of non - diffractive scattering appeared .",
    "developments for the exact solution of the 1d fermi gas with delta - function interaction @xcite are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "a key point is yang s observation @xcite that a generalised bethe s hypothesis works for the fermion problem , subject to a set of cubic equations being satisfied .",
    "this equation has since been referred to as the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) after the name was coined by takhtadzhan and faddeev ( 1979 ) .",
    "baxter s contribution was to independently show that such relations also appear as conditions for commuting transfer matrices in two - dimensional lattice models in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ybe was seen as a relation which can be solved to obtain new exactly solved models .",
    "the ybe thus became celebrated as the masterkey to integrability @xcite .",
    "the study of yang - baxter integrable models flourished in the 70 s , 80 s and 90 s in the canberra , st petersburg , stony brook and kyoto schools , with far reaching implications in both physics and mathematics . during this period",
    "the ybe emerged as the underlying structure behind the solvability of a number of quantum mechanical models .",
    "in addition to the xxz spin chain , examples include the xyz spin chain @xcite , the @xmath0 model at supersymmetric coupling @xcite and the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "three collections of key papers have been published @xcite .",
    "further examples are strongly correlated electron systems @xcite , spin exchange interaction @xcite , kondo physics of quantum impurities coupled to conduction electrons in equilibrium @xcite and out of equilibrium @xcite , the bcs model @xcite , models with long range interactions @xcite , two josephson coupled becs @xcite , bcs - to - bec crossover @xcite , atomic - molecular becs @xcite and quantum degenerate gases of ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "a significant development in the theory of quantum integrable systems is the algebraic ba @xcite , essential to the so called quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) , a quantized version of the classical inverse scattering method .",
    "the qism gives a unified description of the exact solution of quantum integrable models .",
    "it provides a framework to systematically construct and solve quantum many - body systems @xcite ) .",
    "other related threads are the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) @xcite and @xmath1-systems @xcite from which one can derive temperature - dependent properties in an exact non - perturbative fashion . applications of this approach include the heisenberg model @xcite , higher - spin chains @xcite , and integrable quantum spin ladders @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-systems and integrability in general also play a fundamental role in the gauge / string theories of high energy physics @xcite .",
    "yang - baxter integrability has also played a crucial role in initiating and inspiring progress in mathematics . particularly to the theory of knots , links and braids @xcite and the development of quantum groups and representation theory @xcite .      in the mid-60",
    "s many physicists worked on extending the results obtained by lieb and liniger ( 1963 ) and mcguire ( 1964 ) for 1d bosons with delta - function interaction to the problem of 1d fermions .",
    "mcguire @xcite solved the eigenvalue problem of @xmath2 fermions of the same spin and one fermion of opposite spin and studied the low - lying excited states with repulsive and attractive potentials .",
    "the dynamics of this one spin - down fermi problem has been studied @xcite .",
    "the problem of @xmath3 fermions of the same spin with two fermions of opposite spin was solved by flicker and lieb ( 1967 ) .",
    "a further step came when gaudin ( 1967a,1967b ) and yang ( 1967 ) solved the general problem in terms of a nested ba for arbitrary spin population imbalance .",
    "gaudin derived the groundstate energy for the balanced ( fully paired ) case for attractive interaction , pointing out that the result is equivalent to that for repulsive bosons @xcite . the delta - function interacting two - component fermi gas",
    "is commonly referred to as the gaudin - yang model .",
    "yang s concise solution of the problem had a profound impact .",
    "as already remarked above , a key point in the solution is that the matrix operators describing many - body scattering can be factorised into two - body scattering matrices , provided that a set of cubic equations ",
    "the yang - baxter equation  are satisfied by the two - body scattering matrices .",
    "this in turn is equivalent to no diffraction in the outgoing waves in three - body scattering processes . in this sense yang",
    "s solution completes mcguire s formulation of the scattering process in the context of the 1d bose gas .",
    "indeed , the @xmath4-matrix obtained for the 1d bose gas is known as the simplest nontrivial solution of the yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "the solution of the 1d fermi problem triggered a series of further breakthroughs .",
    "yang ( 1968 ) obtained the @xmath5-matrix of the delta - function interacting many - body problem for boltzmann statistics @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the 1d fermi gas with higher spin symmetry was obtained by sutherland @xcite .",
    "the 1d hubbard model solved by lieb and wu ( 1968 ) is a fundamental model in the theory of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "its solution is a significant example of the factorization condition ( the ybe ) in which the quasimomenta of particles @xmath6 is replaced by @xmath7 .",
    "the lieb - wu solution thus gives a similar set of integral equations as yang s fredholm equations for the continuum gas .",
    "this exactly solved model has been extensively studied in the literature . the exact results for the hubbard model not only provide the essential physics of 1d strongly correlated electronic systems @xcite , but also are relevant to phenomena in high @xmath8 superconductivity .",
    "indeed , the 1d hubbard model is an archetypical many - body system featuring fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) pairing , universal tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) physics , spin - charge separation and quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "although further study @xcite of the 1d fermi gas was initiated soon after its solution , it was not until much later that this model began to receive more attention @xcite as a result of the brilliant experimental progress in ultracold atom physics .",
    "the fundamental physics of the model is determined by the set of generalised fredholm integral equations obtained in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "takahashi ( 1970a ) discussed the analyticity of the fredholm equations in the vanishing interaction limit .",
    "a thorough study of the fredholm equations for the gaudin - yang model with attractive and repulsive interactions has been carried out @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of the fredholm equations has also been discussed in the context of harmonic traps @xcite . in particular , the eigenfunction has been obtained explicitly for the fermi gas in the infinitely strong repulsion limit by using the hard - core contact boundary condition @xcite and group theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "the next major advance with implications for the 1d fermi problem was the solution of the finite temperature problem for 1d bosons .",
    "yang and yang ( 1969 ) showed that the thermodynamics of the lieb - liniger bose gas can be determined from the minimisation conditions of the gibbs free energy subject to the ba equations .",
    "takahashi went on to make significant contributions to yang and yang s grand canonical approach to the thermodynamics of 1d integrable models @xcite .",
    "takahashi gave the general name thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations to the yang - yang type of equations for the thermodynamics .",
    "he discovered spin strings patterns to the ba equations in addition to those for the groundstate of the spin chain @xcite . using a similar spin string hypothesis , gaudin ( 1971 ) studied the thermodynamics of the heisenberg - ising chain .",
    "lai ( 1971a , 1973 ) independently derived the tba equations for spin-1/2 fermions in the repulsive regime .",
    "it turns out that takahashi s spin string hypothesis allows one to study the grand canonical ensemble for many 1d many - body systems with internal degrees of freedom , e.g. , the 1d fermi gas @xcite , the 1d hubbard model @xcite , the quantum sine - gordon model @xcite , the kondo problem @xcite among many other integrable models .",
    "building on takahashi s spin string hypothesis , schlottmann derived the tba equations for @xmath9 fermions with repulsive and attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "the yang - yang method has been revealed to be an elegant way to analytically access not only the thermodynamics , but also correlation functions , quantum criticality and tll physics for a wide range of low - dimensional quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the yang - yang thermodynamics of the 1d bose gas has been tested in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , numerical schemes have been developed to solve the tba equations of the 1d two - component spinor bose gas with delta - function interaction @xcite .",
    "the qtm method has also been applied to the thermodynamics of the 1d bose and fermi gases with repulsive delta - function interaction @xcite .",
    "the canberra group and their collaborators @xcite developed an asymptotic method to calculate the thermodynamics of strongly interacting bosons and fermions in an analytic fashion using the polylog function in the framework of the yang - yang and takahashi methods .",
    "this approach does away with the need to numerically solve the tba equations for these systems at quantum criticality , where the temperature is very low and the inter - particle interaction is strong .",
    "the renewed interest over the past decade in 1d fermions has been on a number of related fronts .",
    "here we give a brief introductory outline of these developments .",
    "quantum matter at low temperatures has already been seen to exhibit some remarkable physical properties , such as bec and superfluidity .",
    "fermionic quantum matter with mismatched fermi surfaces has long been expected to exhibit more exotic behaviour than seen in conventional materials .",
    "the two - component attractive fermi gas is particularly interesting due to its connection with the exotic pairing phase  the fflo state  involving bcs pairs with nonzero centre - of - mass momenta . in this phase , where the system is partially polarized",
    ", the fermi energies of spin - up and spin - down electrons become unequal .",
    "originally , fulde and ferrell ( 1964 ) discovered that under a strong external field , superconducting electron pairs have nonzero pairing momentum and spin polarization .",
    "larkin and ovchinnikov ( 1965 ) found that the formation of pairs of electrons with different momenta , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with non zero @xmath12 is energetically favoured over pairs of electrons with opposite momenta , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath13 , when the separation between fermi surfaces is sufficiently large .",
    "consequently , the density of spins and the superconducting order parameter become periodic functions of the spatial coordinates .",
    "theoretical study of the fflo state in 1d interacting fermions was initiated by k. yang ( 2001 ) , who used bosonization to study the pairing correlations .",
    "the fflo - like pair correlations and spin correlations for the attractive hubbard model were later investigated numerically by two groups @xcite .",
    "both groups showed the power - law decay of the form @xmath14 for the pair correlation , with spatial oscillations depending solely on the mismatch @xmath15 of the fermi surfaces .",
    "thus the momentum pair distribution has peaks at the mismatch of the fermi surfaces .",
    "the fflo state has since been studied by various methods : density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , mean field theory and other methods @xcite .",
    "very recently , the asymptotic correlation functions and fflo signature were analytically studied using the dressed charge formalism in the context of the gaudin - yang model @xcite . however , a convincing theoretical proof for the existence of the 1d fflo state in the expansion dynamics of the 1d polarized fermi gas after its sudden release from the longitudinal confining potential is still rather elusive , see recent further developments @xcite .",
    "so far the spatial oscillation nature of fflo pairing has not been experimentally confirmed .",
    "it was shown @xcite that large - spin atomic fermions exhibit rich pairing structures and collective modes in low - energy physics .",

    "i.e. , in the quasi - condensate regime , where bose - einstein condensation may take place and mean - field theory well describes the low - energy physics . in this regime , due to the intrinsic nonlinearity from s - wave scattering between atoms , matter - wave solitons",

    ", fermionization of bose atoms occurs . by loading ultracold bose atoms into a 2d optical lattices ,",
    "the effective mass of quasi - particles can be increased by applying an additional periodic potential along the longitudinal direction  @xcite and therefore an array of tonks - girardeau gases of quasi - particles can be prepared by increasing the effective mass .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath252 can also be changed without modulating the longitudinal trapping enabling the realization of a set of parallel 1d bose atomic gases in the tonks - girardeau regime  @xcite . in the quasi - condensate regime of intermediate values of @xmath252 ,",
    "the experimental measurements suggest that both mean - field theory and fermionization fail to describe this crossover  @xcite .",
    "the _ in situ _ measurements of the linear density of a nearly 1d trapped bose gas on an atom chip indicates a good agreement with theoretical prediction from the yang - yang thermodynamics equations  @xcite .",
    "breathing modes and dipole modes are two usual collective excitations in trapped quantum atomic gases .",
    "the breathing modes can be excited by time - periodically modulating the longitudinal harmonic potential .",
    "the dipole modes can be excited by suddenly displacing the longitudinal harmonic potential .",
    "the ratio of the frequencies of the lowest breathing modes and the dipole modes @xmath1250 has been measured in an array of 1d gases in 2d optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data show @xmath1251 for a lieb - liniger gas and @xmath1252 for a thermal gas , which are consistent with the theoretical results  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of strongly damped dipole oscillations due to quantum fluctuations  @xcite has been reported  @xcite .    the 1d-3d crossover and quantum phase transitions from a 1d superfluid to a mott insulator have been observed in quasi-1d systems of an additional lattice potential along the longitudinal direction  @xcite . for weak interaction ,",
    "the system is still a superfluid at finite lattice depth and the transition to the mott insulator is induced by increasing the lattice depth . for strong interaction , an arbitrary perturbation by a lattice potential may induce a sine - gordon quantum phase transition from a superfluid luttinger liquid to a mott insulator .",
    "these quantum phases can be well distinguished by detecting their low - energy excitations via the technique of bragg spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the techniques of atomic interferometry have been widely used to explore the phase coherence and fluctuations between different 1d gases  @xcite .",
    "the second - order correlation functions , which relate to the density fluctuations and spatial correlations , have been probed by _ in situ _ measurements of density fluctuations  @xcite and _ ex situ _ measurements of photo - association rates  @xcite .",
    "these experiments confirm that the local second - order correlation functions are about @xmath1253 , @xmath1254 and @xmath1255 for an ideal 1d bose gas , a quasi - condensed 1d bose gas and a tonks - girardeau gas , respectively .",
    "in addition to the density correlations , phase correlations have been probed by matter wave interferometry  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the three - body correlation functions of 1d bose gases have been obtained by measuring the three - body recombination rate  @xcite and the _ in situ _ measurements of third - order number fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the measurements of local correlation functions  @xcite , the temporal two - body correlation function has been measured by the techniques of scanning electron microscopy  @xcite .    beyond investigating equilibrium behaviour ,",
    "there have been several experimental studies on non - equilibrium behaviour in 1d bose gases .",
    "the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled 1d bose gases have been explored by using an atom chip  @xcite .",
    "the absence of thermalization in a 1d bose gas has been confirmed by the time evolution from an out - of - equilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of an impurity in 1d bose gases , such as large density fluctuations , multiple scattering events and interaction dependent quadruple oscillations , have been studied in some recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the experimental observations of quantum dynamics of interacting bosons @xcite and fast relaxation towards equilibrium of quasi - local densities , currents and coherence in an isolated strongly correlated 1d bose gas  @xcite give a precise understanding of quantum dynamics and correlations , including observation of the spin dynamics in 1d two - component bose gases  @xcite .",
    "as remarked , quasi-1d trapped systems are created by tight transverse confinement .",
    "a confinement - induced - resonance ( cir ) takes place when the incident channel of two incoming atoms and a transversally excited molecular bound state become degenerate .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a cir takes place if the 3d scattering length approaches the length scale of the transverse trap .",
    "the cir has been used to drive a crossover from the tonks - girardeau gas with a strongly repulsive interaction to a super tonks - girardeau gas with strongly attractive interaction  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the stable highly excited gas - like phase known as the super tonks - girardeau gas has been realized in the strongly attractive regime of bosonic cesium atoms .      in a 3d",
    "trapped fermi gas , the bound diatomic molecules exist only when the scattering length between the atoms is positive under s - wave interaction , i.e. , when @xmath1256  @xcite . in the limit @xmath1257 , the system is a weakly attractive fermi gas .",
    "thus the groundstate is a bcs pair state for a negative scattering length  @xcite .",
    "however , in a 1d two - component trapped fermi gas , the scattering properties of two colliding atoms are altered by the tight transverse confinement .",
    "the existence of a bound state does not rely on the sign of the scattering length . using ratio - frequency spectroscopy in an array of 1d fermi atomic gases trapped within a 2d optical lattice , moritz and coworkers",
    "@xcite reported this that the two - body bound state exists irrespective of the sign of scattering length , see fig .",
    "[ fig : binding - energy ] . in this experiment",
    ", they further demonstrated that the bound states for negative scattering length can only be stabilized by the tight transverse confinement  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the particle and hole dynamics of fermionic atoms in amplitude - modulated 1d lattices was reported @xcite .        the strong transverse confinement of a waveguide not only gives rise to an effective 1d s - wave interaction , but also alters the p - wave interaction in spin - polarized fermions .",
    "due to the absence of s - wave interaction in the spin - polarized fermi gas , the p - wave interaction becomes dominant under resonant scattering conditions  @xcite . in a spin - polarized fermi gas ,",
    "the angular part of asymptotic collision wave functions is either the spherical harmonic @xmath1258 if the scattering state is parallel to the quantization axis or @xmath1259 if the scattering state is perpendicular to the quantization axis . therefore ,",
    "in both the 2d and 3d cases , due to the coexistence of two collision channels and the breakdown of degeneracy between two collision channels  @xcite , doublet structures of p - wave feshbach resonance have been observed  @xcite .",
    "however , for the 1d spin - polarized system , only one of two collision channels is involved .",
    "thus there is a single peak structure of p - wave feshbach resonance in 1d spin - polarized fermions .",
    "the experimental observation has confirmed such a particular signature  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance - peak ] . by loading the spin - polarized fermi atoms into a deep 3d optical lattice",
    ", one can prepare a band insulator of localized atoms in potential wells , which is viewed as a zero - dimensional ( 0d ) system .",
    "there is no resonance feature in such a 0d system because the p - wave scattering is completely inhibited . when the geometry of the gas is tuned from 3d to 2d , the shift of the p - wave feshbach resonance depends on the depth of the optical lattice .",
    "in contrast , 1d fermi gases show a further shift of resonance and give rise to a broadening of the loss feature .     and",
    "@xmath1260 ) give rise to a doublet feature .",

    ", the fflo state occupies a tiny portion of the phase diagram and it is very difficult to observe in experiments .",
    "in contrast , in the 1d gaudin - yang model  @xcite the fflo state becomes much more robust due to the band fillings of two fermi seas related with one another , and it occupies major parts of the phase diagram , as demonstrated in fig .",

    "the energy of the two - particle system in the state @xmath1272 is determined by tuning the trapping potential barrier through which the particles can tunnel out .",
    "the fermionization of two distinguishable fermions was identified by measuring the tunnelling time constants for different values of the 1d interacting strength .",
    "it is particularly interesting that for a magnetic field below the confined induced resonance two interacting fermions form a tonks - girardeau state whereas a super tonks - girardeau gas is created when the magnetic field is above the resonance value , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1dfermionization ] . in this case , the two - particle super tonks - girardeau state is stable against three - body collisional losses since there is no third particle present .",
    "in previous sections we have seen how results for exactly solved models of 1d fermi gases provide valuable insights into a wide range of many - body phenomena including fermi polarons , fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov - like pairing , the few - body physics of trions , tomonaga - luttinger liquids , spin - charge separation , universal contact , quantum criticality and universal scaling .",
    "this included discussion of the exotic many - body physics of 1d fermi - bose mixtures and 1d multi - component interacting fermions , in particular with @xmath735 , @xmath19 and @xmath9 symmetries .",
    "we reviewed experimental progress on the realisation of 1d quantum atomic gases and the experimental confirmation of the phase diagram of the gaudin - yang model in a 1d harmonic trap . in the present section ,",
    "we discuss some of the promising developments and provide an outlook for future research .",
    "the key points we have identified are as follows .",
    "\\(a ) _ high spin symmetries .",
    "_ very recent experimental exploration of highly symmetric mott insulators @xcite gives insight into the pomeranchuk ( 1950 ) type of cooling due to the fact that the spin degrees in the mott insulating state can hold more entropy than the fermi liquid does . in this mott insulating state , the entropy per site increases as the spin degrees of freedom increase .",
    "it in turn leads to a temperature reduction through transfer of entropy from particle motion to spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this exotic nature is different from large spins in solids where the quantum fluctuations of large spins are weak .",
    "such higher symmetry opens up further study of magnetically ordered phases in ultracold fermionic atoms .",
    "in particular , loading large spin ultracold fermionic atoms into a 1d quantum wire geometry provides exciting opportunities to test multi - component tll theory and competing superfluid ordering in 1d interacting fermions with higher symmetries .",
    "e.g. , @xmath21 , @xmath19 and @xmath1273 symmetries in spin-3/2 fermions .",
    "it is natural to expect that 1d interacting fermions with large spin resulting from higher mathematical symmetries will greatly expand our understanding of many - body physics .",
    "however , comprehensive understanding of these models still poses theoretical and experimental challenges due to the more complicated grand canonical ensembles involved .",
    "\\(b ) _ p - wave bcs pairing and synthetic gauge fields . _",
    "the traditional s - wave bcs pairing models have various applications to problems in condensed matter physics @xcite , nuclear physics @xcite and ultrasmall metallic grains @xcite _ etc_. more work along this line has been achieved in the study of a @xmath1274 pairing model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the s - wave pairing model , the @xmath1274 pairing model has an exotic zero temperature phase diagram in terms of density and attractive coupling strength @xcite .",
    "it shows two superfluid phases  confined strong - pairing and deconfined weak - pairing , separated by a third - order confinement - deconfinement quantum phase transition .",
    "moreover , a type of electron pairing model with spin - orbit interactions shows that the pairing order parameter can always have @xmath1274-wave symmetry regardless of the strength of pairing interactions @xcite .",
    "more work is required along this line .",
    "in particular , recent developments in the study of ultracold atoms have opened up new opportunities to simulate synthetic external abelian and non - abelian gauge fields coupled to neutral atoms by controlling atom - light interactions @xcite and the ultracold - atom analog of the mesoscopic conductor @xcite .",
    "an important application of this synthetic gauge field is the realisation of spin - orbit coupling in degenerate fermi gases @xcite .",
    "the fano - feshbach resonances can be used to modify the strength of atomic interactions without changing the characteristic range of the potential @xcite .",
    "raman laser beams coupled to zeeman states of ultracold fermionic atoms can create synthetic magnetic , electric fields and spin - orbit coupling , see a brief review @xcite .",
    "these new developments inspire further study of spin - orbit coupling , p - wave and d - wave pairing by exact solutions of new mathematical models , with clear applications in physics .",
    "\\(c ) _ universal wilson ratio . _",
    "the low - energy physics of interacting fermi systems exhibits universal phenomena , such as tll in 1d and fermi liquids in higher dimensions .",
    "it is highly desirable to find an intrinsic connection between these low - energy theories .",
    "the wilson ratio is the ratio of susceptibility to specific heat .",
    "despite these two physical quantities having different low temperature behaviour , the wilson ratio is a constant at the fixed point of interacting fermionic systems in 3d @xcite . for noninteracting electrons , the wilson ratio is unity .",
    "the value of the ratio indicates interaction effects and quantifies spin fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to the phenomenological tll parameters , this ratio gives a measurable physical quantity which manifests universal tll physics  the effective fixed point model of the tll universality class .",
    "experimental measurement of the wilson ratio of the tll in a spin-1/2 heisenberg ladder has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "it is naturally to believe that this ratio can be used to quantify the magnetic phases ( the fflo - like phases ) in 1d attractive fermi gases of ultracold atoms with different symmetries .",
    "we remark that at the critical point it is a constant solely dependent on the tll parameter and onset charge velocities of different states .",
    "this ratio is experimentally measurable with ultracold fermi atomic gases trapped in 1d .",
    "\\(d ) _ diffraction vs non - diffraction . _",
    "non - diffraction in the many - particle scattering process is a unique feature of integrable systems @xcite . in principle ,",
    "diffractive and non - diffractive scattering can be tuned via controlling inter- and intra - species scattering lengths .",
    "experimental exploration of a violation of this characteristic would yield valuable insight into understanding the non - diffractive form of the bethe ansatz wave function , i.e. , how weak violations of non - diffractive scattering still give rise to the bethe ansatz wave function in the asymptotic region .",
    "1d many - body systems with a finite range potential between atoms are likely to be an ideal simulator for identifying the consequences of diffractive _ vs _ non - diffractive scattering . in this regard , across a narrow resonance , the 1d effective potential is determined by not only the scattering length , but also the effective range which is introduced by a strong energy - dependent scattering amplitude of two colliding atoms @xcite . beyond the fermionization of two distinguishable fermions @xcite",
    ", it is an immediate goal to experimentally probe three distinguishable fermions in a 1d harmonic trap .",
    "a possible test of the fundamental nature of diffraction _ vs _ non - diffraction for systems with three particles may ultimately lead to experimental tests for yang - baxter integrability in quantum many - body systems .",
