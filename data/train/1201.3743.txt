    "considerable progress in the theory of conical spikes started from taylor s investigations @xcite .",
    "he has shown that , for a cone with a half - angle of @xmath1 , the surface electrostatic pressure @xmath2 depends on the distance from its apex as @xmath3 and , hence , can be counterbalanced by the surface pressure @xmath4 .",
    "the geometry of ion - emitting cones ( taylor cones ) was investigated in numerous experimental works @xcite . these works",
    "testify that an increase in the applied potential difference is accompanied not only by the appearance and increase of the emission current , but also by a decrease of the cone half - angle . for small currents ,",
    "i.e. , when the space charge influence is negligible , the half - angle is close to taylor s angle @xmath5 . the phenomenon of a cone sharpening can be interpreted as the system response aimed at the conservation of the balance of the pressures @xmath2 and @xmath6 under the conditions of the screening effect of the space charge .",
    "the last effect in case of an emitter with invariable shape , as is known @xcite , reduces to the child - langmuir law .",
    "simple analytic models , which relate the basic parameters of a problem , play an important role in gaining an insight into the physical processes that occur in liquid - metal ion sources . among these models",
    "are mair s theory @xcite , the models by kingham & swanson @xcite , mair & forbes @xcite , and , certainly , taylor s model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the above - listed models do not present a theoretical description of the current dependence of the cone angle . in this work ,",
    "we propose a model , which generalizes , on the one hand , taylor s solution to the case where the space charge starts playing an important part , and on the other hand , the child - langmuir law to the case of an emitter of variable ( self - adjusting ) shape .",
    "it is based on self - similar solutions for a charged particle flow @xcite , which were found to be compatible with the laplace - young stress condition for a liquid conducting cone : see our letter @xcite . clearly , this model does not attempt to describe all the features of operation of liquid - metal ion sources .",
    "the application of self - similar solutions restricts our analysis to precisely conical shape of the emitter .",
    "so , possible deformations of the emitting cone observed in experiments , in particular , the appearance of small jet - like protrusion on its vertex remain beyond the scope of this paper . the advantage of the proposed model is the possibility to describe distributions of the electric field potential and of the ion velocity field over the cone and , as a consequence , to obtain relations between the cone angle , the current , and the applied voltage",

    "this approximation can be considered to be well founded in view of the extremely high values of electric field strength near the cone tip .",

    "the third equation is the continuity equation .",
    "the poisson equation ( [ system1 ] ) has to be solved together with the condition that the conductor surface is equipotential .",
    "it is convenient to take the electric potential of the the anode be equal to zero , @xmath11 , which agrees with the condition that the initial velocity of particles is zero , @xmath21 ( see equation ( [ system2 ] ) ) .",
    "the equilibrium configuration of the free liquid - metal surface is determined by the balance condition for the electrostatic and capillary forces ( the laplace - young equation ) . for a conical surface it takes the form : @xmath22 where @xmath7 is the cone half - angle , @xmath23 is the surface tension , and @xmath24 is the distance from the cone apex . in the case of a high mass flow rate ,",
    "characteristic for the so - called cone - jet mode of electrosprays @xcite or for sonic sprays @xcite , the hydrodynamic term also contributes to the pressure balance condition .",

    "consequently , the system ( [ sysrt ] ) can be reduced by means of the following self - similar ansatz ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are unknown functions of the polar angle @xmath36 .    in the dimensionless form",

    "the intensity of the ion flux can be characterized by the electrical current @xmath61 ( in dimensional form ) flowing through the sphere of radius @xmath10 with a center at the apex of the cone : @xmath62 as a corresponding dimensionless quantity , it is convenient to take the group @xmath63 which does not contain the potential difference @xmath9 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 by following relation : @xmath64 the function @xmath65 defines the particle flux from the top part of the cone , @xmath66 .",

    "this corresponds to the power law between the quantities @xmath71 and @xmath68 on the cone surface , @xmath72 it correctly reflects the basic property of the system , namely , the nonlinear growth of current density with increasing intensity .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath73 power law certainly differs from the exponential dependence determined by the kinetics of the field evaporation process @xcite .    our solutions would be exact if the actual relation between the flux density and the electric field were the same as the model relation ( [ modellaw ] ) .",
    "note that the self - similar solutions corresponding to the model law of emission ( [ modellaw ] ) are the only solutions consistent with our main assumption that the surface of a liquid metal is conical .",
    "any distinction of the law of emission from the model law ( [ modellaw ] ) will lead to deviation of the surface from the ideal cone .",
    "however , it is known from the experiments @xcite that the surface takes a near - conical shape , and it is possible to associate it with a certain cone half - angle @xmath7 ( the method of angle measurement is given in the above - mentioned papers ) .",
    "that is , the details of the current density distribution over the emitter surface ( basically , ions evaporate from the protrusion growing at the cone apex ) have a relatively small influence on the balance between the electrostatic and capillary forces at the periphery of the cone structures .",
    "the reason is that the influence of the space charge has an integral character ( this phenomenon is most conspicuous in planar geometry , where the screening effect of the space charge in principle does not depend on its distribution ) . as a consequence , our approach ,",
    "not claiming to describe lmis operation in detail , is rather applicable for the analysis of the integral ( averaged ) characteristics of lmis , including the relations between the cone half - angle @xmath7 , the total emission current @xmath74 , and the applied voltage @xmath38 .",

    "in order to compare the results of our calculations with experimental data , we assume that the control parameter of the model @xmath9 is directly proportional to the potential difference @xmath174 applied to the interelectrode space , i.e. , @xmath175 where the proportionality coefficient @xmath176 is determined by constructional features of an experimental facility and does not depend on the emission current . then , after switching to dimensional quantities , the expressions ( [ eqdima ] ) and ( [ jr ] ) become @xmath177 @xmath178 here we take into account that the characteristic size @xmath10 of the top part of the infinite model cone ( the electric current from this part of the cone is identified with the emission current from the experimentally observed conical spike ) can depend on the value of the emission current and , as a consequence , on the angle @xmath7 .",
    "the relations ( [ valf ] ) and ( [ iv ] ) together with the approximate formulas ( [ apprec ] ) , ( [ apprj ] ) or ( [ apprec ] ) , ( [ apprjv ] ) allow one to determine the free parameters of the model , namely , the characteristic size of the cone @xmath179 and the coefficient @xmath176 characterizing the electric field distribution in the experimental facilities , from the available experimental data on current - voltage and current - angle dependencies for liquid - metal ion sources . we have used data for emission into vacuum from liquid indium @xcite , gallium @xcite , tin @xcite , and also from liquid alloys au@xmath0si @xcite , co@xmath0ge @xcite , and au@xmath0ge @xcite . in our calculations we have taken the following values of the surface tension : @xmath180 n / m ( in , @xcite ) , 0.735 n / m ( ga , @xcite ) , 0.560 n / m ( sn , @xcite ) , 2.20 n / m ( au@xmath0si , @xcite ) , 1.84 n / m ( co+ge , @xcite ) , and 1.62 n / m ( au@xmath0ge , @xcite ) .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath10 was approximated by the two - parameter function @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the maximum half - angle @xmath184 , corresponding to zero emission current in the experiments @xcite , slightly differs from the taylor angle @xmath5 .",
    "then , for comparison with the theory , the experimentally observed values of @xmath7 have been corrected by @xmath185 .        due to its physical properties ( low temperature of melting , low pressure of saturated vapor , primarily single ionization in the emission processes ) ,",
    "gallium is the most convenient and reliable metal for investigating the operation of liquid - metal ion sources @xcite . in the work @xcite the gallium ion sources , including a tungsten needles with tip radius @xmath186  @xmath187 m and @xmath188  @xmath187 m , were investigated . as a result of treating data on the current - voltage characteristics and geometry of the observed structures on the surface of liquid gallium , presented in @xcite",
    ", we obtain : @xmath189 , @xmath190  @xmath187 m , @xmath191  @xmath187 m ( @xmath186  @xmath187 m ) ; @xmath192 , @xmath193  @xmath187 m , @xmath191  @xmath187 m ( @xmath188  @xmath187 m ) . the achieved quality of describing the experimental data is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f.gga ] .",
    "application of a sharper needle ( with @xmath186  @xmath187 m ) provides a stronger focusing of the electric field that corresponds to a larger value of the coefficient @xmath176 and , consequently , to a smaller value of the threshold potential difference ( see fig .",
    "[ f.gga ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a small initial radius of curvature probably begins to `` constrict '' the developing cone ; the value of @xmath182 corresponding to @xmath186  @xmath187 m is somewhat smaller than for @xmath188  @xmath187 m .",
    "according to the relations ( [ valf ] ) and ( [ iv ] ) , smaller size of the cone leads to faster change of the cone half - angle with increase in emission current , all other parameters ( the surface tension coefficient , the mass and charge of emitted particles ) being the same ( see fig .",
    "[ f.gga ] ) .",
    "note that the obtained values of @xmath182 are comparable with the size of the experimentally observed cones ( they are of the order of 1  @xmath187 m ) .",
    "[ f.insn ] shows the current - voltage and current - angle dependencies for the conical spikes observed at the surface of liquid indium @xcite and tin @xcite .",
    "probably , the strongly nonlinear character of the current - voltage dependence for indium is an experimental error @xcite . in later publications",
    "@xcite the same authors approximate this dependence by a linear function ; its slope is approximately the same as for the corresponding theoretical curve in fig .",
    "[ f.insn ] .",
    "it has been noted in @xcite that both singly - charged ions sn@xmath194 and doubly - charged ions sn@xmath195 are emitted from the surface of tin .",
    "the fraction of doubly - charged ions is @xmath196% @xcite .",
    "it is easy to verify that the relations obtained above are applicable for a flow consisting of @xmath197 different types of particles .",
    "the only necessary modification refers to the expression for total current ( [ iv ] ) .",
    "we should apply the following change : @xmath198 where @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 are the charge , mass , and relative fraction of particles of @xmath202-type .",
    "so , for the case of tin ( @xmath203 , @xmath204 ) , the expression ( [ iv ] ) transforms into @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the elementary charge .",
    "indium ions are emitted in the singly - charged state in@xmath194 @xcite , so that such modification is not required for an indium liquid - metal ion source .",
    "the theoretical curves presented in fig .  [ f.insn ] correspond to the following values of the parameters : @xmath207 , @xmath208  @xmath187 m , @xmath209  @xmath187 m ( in ) ; @xmath210 , @xmath211  @xmath187 m , @xmath212  @xmath187 m ( sn ) .",
    "indium and tin have close atomic weights and surface tension coefficients . in this connection , a sharp distinction between the dependences @xmath213 and @xmath214 corresponding to these metals is surprising @xcite .",
    "one of the likely reasons of the different behavior of indium and tin is the presence of a large amount of ions sn@xmath215 in the experiments @xcite .",
    "ions with larger charge numbers move faster away from the electrode and , as a consequence , provide less screening effect .",
    "therefore , an increase in the voltage is accompanied by a larger increase in the emission current and by a relatively slow change in the cone shape .",
    "the dependences @xmath213 and @xmath214 , corresponding to the assumptions that only the singly - charged ions sn@xmath194 are emitted from liquid tin and the parameters @xmath176 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 are fixed , are shown in fig .",
    "[ f.insn ] by the dotted line .",
    "one can see that considering only singly - charged ions slightly approaches the model characteristics of liquid - metal emitters based on liquid tin and indium .",
    "however , the initial difference between the curves is too large and can not be explained only by the presence of ions sn@xmath195 .",
    "another reason of the behavior difference between liquid - metal ion sources is in the conditions of experimental studies @xcite and @xcite . the theoretical model presented in this work points to the essential difference between the characteristic sizes @xmath182 of the cones .",
    "one can assume that the developing cone was `` constricted '' by the small size of the tip of a tungsten needle in the experiment with indium ( @xmath216  @xmath187 m according to @xcite ) .",
    "although the value of the tip radius @xmath217  @xmath187 m for the experiments with indium was indicated in the subsequent paper @xcite , it was measured with the help of the image of the liquid surface instead of the needle .",
    "the above analysis of gallium emitters with different needles shows that the `` constriction '' effect becomes appreciable if @xmath218  @xmath187 m .",

    "theory and observations are in rather good agreement only for au@xmath0si from the above - listed alloys .",
    "the alloys containing germanium are distinguished by the presence of breaks on the experimental curves @xmath214 .",
    "such a behavior can not be described in the framework of the proposed model .",
    "the anomalous character of the dependence @xmath214 can be caused by changing properties of charged particles flow .",
    "so , `` freezing '' of the cone angle along with the continuing growth of the emission current , which is characteristic for the mentioned alloys ( see fig .  [ f.mix ] ) , allows us to suppose that , from some point , the average ratio of mass and charge dencities over the flow essentially decreases .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental works @xcite does not include information about changes in the mass / charge ratio with the emission current . in fig .",
    "[ f.mix ] the theoretical curves are obtained under the assumption that the intensive emission of doubly - charged germanium ions ge@xmath195 starts with some value of the applied potential difference , @xmath227 ( or current , @xmath228 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath227 , @xmath228 are of the order of @xmath229  kv , 30  mka for the alloy co@xmath0ge , and 6.3  kv , 15  mka for au@xmath0ge . in both cases ,",
    "the potential drop is @xmath230  kv at the distance of the order of the cone size ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "in the present paper we have developed the self - consistent model describing how the space charge near the emitting cone apex affects its shape .",
    "our approach is based on the self - similar reduction of the equations , which govern the spatial distributions of the electric field , ion velocity field , and particle concentration , to the system of ordinary differential equations . as a result of numerical solution of this system ,",
    "the conditions of the mutual compensation of the capillary and electrostatic forces on the conic surface of a liquid - metal anode have been obtained .",
    "this allows us to find the dependences of the cone angle and emission current on the applied potential difference .",
    "they correctly represent the main features of the operation of a liquid - metal ion source .",
    "a comparison was made between the developed theoretical model and available experimental data for emission from pure gallium , indium , tin , or from alloys au@xmath0si , co@xmath0ge , and au@xmath0ge .",
    "basing on our theoretical results , we have proposed explanations for some specific features of the emissive behavior of these systems .",
    "so , the difference in behavior between indium and tin having close characteristics ( the coefficient of surface tension , the mass / charge ratio ) is probably related with the presence of doubly - charged ions sn@xmath195 for tin emission and with use of a sharper tungsten needle in the experiments with indium .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us note once again that the developed model does not pretend to describe all aspects of operation of liquid - metal ion sources .",
    "in particular , the consideration of the jet - like protrusion at the cone vertex , from where the vast majority of ions are evaporated , remains beyond the scope of the model .",
    "the self - similar solutions used above describe lmis operation in terms of the averaged characteristics ( @xmath7 , @xmath61 , and @xmath174 ) only .",
