    "at high densities strongly dipolar fluids can exhibit an orientationally ordered liquid phase characterized by a spontaneous magnetization .",
    "this has been demonstrated for the first time by monte carlo simulations of dipolar soft spheres by wei and patey @xcite and has been confirmed by simulations of hard spheres @xcite and of stockmayer fluids @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches leading to the same conclusion include a mean - field theory for a dipolar lattice gas @xcite , a generalized van der waals theory @xcite , and different kinds of density - functional theory @xcite . at low densities the typical configurations of dipolar fluids exhibit chain formation @xcite which may inhibit the phase transition from the isotropic vapor phase to the isotropic liquid phase @xcite .",
    "if the dipole moments are _ electric _ as in molecular liquids the orientationally ordered phase exhibits a spontaneous polarization ; in the case of _ magnetic _ dipoles as in ferrofluids , i.e. , colloidal suspensions of permanently ferromagnetic particles , one speaks of ferromagnetic order and a spontaneous magnetization . in this paper we adopt the magnetic language , keeping in mind that completely analogous phenomena occur in the electric case ( as long as no free charge carriers are present in the fluid ) .    in both simulations and analytic theories the dipolar forces must be treated carefully due to their long range which may give rise to effects depending on the shape of the sample .",
    "it turns out that for all sample shapes with the exception of a long needle the equilibrium configuration is inhomogeneous with a spatially varying magnetization @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a shape _ independent _ free energy , as is expected on general grounds @xcite .",
    "the highly non - trivial problem to determine explicitly the spatial distribution of this inhomogeneous magnetization for a given sample shape has not yet been solved satisfactorily . in simulations",
    "usually a homogeneous magnetization is enforced by using an infinitely permeable surrounding of the periodically repeated simulation cells .",
    "if instead the sample is surrounded by vacuum the simulation cell splits into two domains with opposing magnetizations @xcite .",
    "but this structure is clearly induced by the artificial periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we addressed this problem recently @xcite for the experimentally more relevant case of open boundaries and obtained the following general characterization of the equilibrium configurations : on a macroscopic scale the absolute value of @xmath1 is constant , its divergence is zero , and at the surfaces the normal component vanishes .",
    "however , these properties do not yet enable one to construct the configuration for a given shape . for a cubic sample we determined @xcite the most stable configuration under the constraint of sharp domain boundaries .",
    "it consists of four triangular domains with @xmath2 domain walls in between .",
    "in contrast to solid ferromagnets the number of domains does not increase with the system size , but remains as small as possible . on the other hand the assumption of sharp domain boundaries",
    "is not justified for liquid systems . due to",
    "the lack of a lattice anisotropy one rather expects very thick domain walls @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to analyze the domain configuration in more detail in the present work we have performed a numerical minimization of an approximate microscopic density functional which has been used before @xcite to describe the ferromagnetically ordered fluid .",
    "we have made no a priori assumptions regarding the symmetry of the domain structure and have minimized with respect to a large number ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) of parameters which represent the local magnetization at mesh points within the sample .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to the determination of the magnetization structure of solid ferromagnetic particles of micrometer size in the framework of micromagnetic theory @xcite .",
    "but there are two main differences .",
    "first , we do not constrain the absolute value of the magnetization , thus allowing for the formation of less ordered regions .",
    "second , we work on the microscopic scale determined by the particle diameter , which enables us to examine in detail the overall structure as well as the structure of domain walls and the cores of topological defects .    a brief account of some of our results has been published in [ simannlett ] . here",
    "we provide the important derivation of the functional from the underlying model , discuss the implementation of the simulated annealing , and give a thorough analysis of the resulting configurations .",
    "we also analyze the consequences of the necessary discretization and of the finite sample size .",
    "furthermore we discuss in detail the orientational structure in an external field , which is relevant for the experiments with the recently discovered metallic liquid ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "we consider stockmayer fluids consisting of spherical particles with fixed embedded point dipoles which interact via pairwise dispersion and dipolar forces .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath5 is the sum of the lennard - jones potential @xmath6 and the dipolar potential @xmath7 @xmath8 denotes the interparticle vector , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the orientations of the dipole moments at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , with an absolute value @xmath13 ; hats indicate unit vectors . at short distances",
    "the interaction is cut off by the heaviside function @xmath14 .    in order to study the spatially inhomogeneous configurations within a ferromagnetically ordered fluid we employ the density - functional theory introduced in [ frodl1 ] and for which we have worked out analytical results previously @xcite .",
