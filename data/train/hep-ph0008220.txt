    "4 .   observe the mass spectrum in the scalar and pseudoscalar sector for @xmath81 and fix these coupling constants to the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath82 mass splittings .",
    "it is crucial for the description of the light meson sector with @xmath77 that a flavour dependent force lifts the degeneracies which would otherwise occur in models only assuming confinement and/or one  gluon  exchange potentials .",

    "the pseudoscalar mesons are bound by confinement only .",

    "this is somewhat puzzling since this state is often considered to be a @xmath96 molecule  an assignment that would be consistent with the fact that we indeed can not describe the @xmath93 with the parameters of model @xmath83 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the scalar meson spectrum and its interpretation in the framework of the parameter set @xmath83 .",
    "* the complete kaonic spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : isodublett ] ) and table [ tab : massesisodublett ] .",
    "we observe a very good agreement with the established experimental data for angular momenta from @xmath77 to @xmath97 with one exception : as in the isovector sector , the @xmath98 state is lowered significantly in model @xmath94 compared to model @xmath83 .",
    "let us briefly comment on this @xmath99 ground state : compared to the pdg value of @xmath100mev ( see @xcite ) , we find a significant lowering of the mass in model @xmath94 compared to model @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , there is an indication from a recent @xmath5matrix analysis for the scalar nonet that the @xmath101 ground state actually might be around 1200mev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although there are good reasons to compare our results to the `` bare poles '' of such an analysis where the effects of decay ",
    "channel couplings are at least partially taken into account , we have to refrain from a detailed discussion until such an analysis has indeed been performed in all meson sectors .",
    "+ furthermore , we note that the calculated states in the @xmath102 spectrum are each twice degenerate ; the present interactions do not distinguish the @xmath103 and the @xmath104 states and therefore do not show the experimentally observed splitting .",
    "however , we want to mention that an alternative procedure for the regularization of t hooft s instanton  induced force seperates these two states ; the reason is that the strict @xmath77 selection rule for this interaction is relaxed if the regularization is applied before evaluating the occuring matrix elements .",
    "this effect , although strongly suppressed , yields the correct splittings in the @xmath102 sector , but we will not discuss further the implications of this slightly modified approach for the residual interaction in our model .",
    "+ in the pdg listings ( see @xcite ) , it is stated that the masses of the @xmath105 and the @xmath106 need confirmation ; they are therefore omitted in the summary tables .",
    "we stress that our calculated masses for these states fit perfectly in a linear regge plot for the @xmath107 mesons  in contrast to the experimental @xmath105 and @xmath106 data shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : isodublett ] ) .",
    "we thus support the statement that these have to be considered with caution . * in fig .",
    "( [ fig : isoscalar ] ) and table [ tab : massesisoscalar ] , the results for the isoscalar mass spectra are presented and compared to experimental data .",
    "similar to the pattern in the isovector and isodublet sector , we find a remarkable downward shift of the scalar states in model @xmath94 compared to model @xmath83 .",
    "we thus arrive at two alternative interpretations of the scalar isoscalar @xmath8 spectrum : in model @xmath83 , we might identify the lowest calculated @xmath108 state ( mainly flavour singlet ) either with the broad structure @xmath109 or with the @xmath110 meson and the second state at @xmath111 1500mev as a member of the flavour octet ; accordingly , this would leave either the @xmath110 or the @xmath109 and the @xmath112 as non@xmath8 state .",
    "let us note that if we furthermore regard the @xmath113 decay width and the strong decay width of our lowest @xmath114 state in model @xmath83 , we would slightly prefer the @xmath110 to be the @xmath8 candidate ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . in model @xmath94 ,",
    "we do account for a very low  lying scalar state ( `` @xmath115 meson '' ) , the next excitations to be identified with states around 1250mev and 1550mev .",
    "as mentioned above , model @xmath94 also accounts for the @xmath93 meson as a @xmath8 state whereas this can not be confirmed with the parameters of model @xmath83 .",
    "clearly , on the basis of the spectrum alone this interpretation can be prelimininary at best , especially in view of the complexity in this sector that arises from strong decay channel couplings and possible mixtures with gluonic or other exotic states .",
    "a more detailed discussion which also includes numerical results on the strong decay widths of these states will be given in a forthcoming paper ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ finally we want to comment on the @xmath116 : neither in model @xmath83 nor in model @xmath94 we can interpret this as a @xmath8 bound state .",
    "indeed , it has recently been stated in @xcite that there is no experimental evidence for an @xmath116 in the reaction @xmath117 .    in summary",
    ", we find a good overall agreement both in model @xmath83 and @xmath94 .",
    "the discrepancies , occuring _",
    "e.g. _ in the @xmath105 or @xmath106 masses , can mostly be traced back to questionable @xmath8 assignments of the considered states .",
    "we find the right behaviour with respect to the linear regge trajectories @xmath49 up to highest angular momenta as has been shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : reggeplot ] ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the instanton ",
    "induced effects our model shows the correct splitting in the pseudoscalar sector independent of the underlying parameter set .",
    "the effects of the different dirac structures of the confinement force in model @xmath83 and @xmath94 and their implications for the non  relativistic reduction of the salpeter equation will be discussed in the detailed analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "altogether , a linearly rising confinement potential plus a residual interaction  la t hooft provides a very satisfacting description of the light @xmath48 spectra .",
    "therefore we consider our approach based on the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation in its instantaneous approximation as a trustworthy framework for studying not only meson masses but also their characteristic decays , especially in the pseudoscalar sector .",
    "in previous publications ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , we have studied various mesonic decay properties such as the widths of the decays @xmath118 or the decay constants @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , electromagnetic form factors of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons have been investigated as well as electromagnetic decays like @xmath121 and related processes .",
    "we note that instanton  induced vertices in strong decays were also studied ( see @xcite ) ; a more extensive publication in this context including quark loop contributions is in preparation @xcite .",
    "we want to extend these approaches to other processes where @xmath8 bound states are involved .",
    "firstly , we will pick up the recent discussion of the pseudoscalar decay constants ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and quote our results for the @xmath6 and the @xmath82 meson for their _ nonstrange _ and _ strange _ content separately .",
    "we will review the two photon decay of @xmath9 mesons and the related transition form factors at various photon virtualities in section [ gammagammadecay ] where our results for @xmath122 will be linked to the pseudoscalar decay constants .",
    "we present the electromagnetic form factors of the charged @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons for the sake of completeness since they have not been published yet in the parameter sets that we adopt in this paper . for the same reason , we also present new results on the electromagnetic decay widths of the processes @xmath123 that have already been studied in ref . @xcite",
    "then , we will comment on the weak decays @xmath1 before we finally investigate our results on the form factors of the so  called @xmath3 decay .",
    "let us stress that these calculations concerning meson decay properties are done in the parameter sets @xmath83 and @xmath94 that were completely fixed with regard to the experimental meson mass spectra .",
    "we do therefore not introduce new parameters or alter the models discussed in the previous section since we aim at a global description of meson masses as well as their characteristic decays .      in recent years",
    ", the question of pseudoscalar decay constants  especially those of the @xmath6 and @xmath82 mesons  was discussed in numerous publications ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it has become clear that due to the mixing in the isoscalar sector , the contributions of the _ nonstrange _ and the _ strange _ content ( or between singlet and octet contributions in an alternate mixing scheme ) have to be distinguished .",
    "let us start our discussion with the definition of the pseudoscalar decay constant with the axial current @xmath124 for a pion with positive charge : @xmath125 in a similar way , one can define the decay constant of the @xmath126 meson ; these constants are related with the corresponding decay constants for the neutral mesons via @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "due to the instantaneous approximation , @xmath119 can be derived from the pion s salpeter amplitude @xmath129 in the rest frame of the meson : @xmath130\\nonumber\\\\ & \\stackrel{\\scriptscriptstyle p=(m,\\vec 0)}{= } &   \\frac{\\sqrt    3}{m_\\pi}\\int\\frac{d^3 p}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\mbox{tr }     \\left[\\phi _ { ( \\pi)}(\\vec p)\\gamma_0\\gamma_5\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the trace is evaluated only on dirac indices .",
    "it can be shown analytically that the latter expression is proportional to the difference of upper and lower component of the equal  time wave function of the pion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath119 is highly sensitive on relativistic ingredients of the model in which it is calculated ; in non  relativistic models , the evaluation fails typically by orders of magnitude . as has been shown in refs . @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the electromagnetic decay widths for @xmath131 can be treated in a similar way ; the numerical results for the parameter sets @xmath83 and @xmath94 of this work are comparable to the widths of model v2 in these previous publications .    in table",

    "although our relativistic ansatz improves dramatically the result compared to non  relativistic calculations , we find in these results a shortcoming of our model which might be related to the instantaneous approximation of the underlying bethe  salpeter equation and/or our refraining from `` running quark masses '' .    now let us focus the @xmath6 and the @xmath82 meson , respectively .",
    "as we have already emphasized , mixing between the _ nonstrange _ and the _ strange _ sector is crucial for the understanding of the isoscalar states .",

    "note that there are also some new estimates for these coefficients based on a phenomenological analysis of the availiable world data .",
    "they are also quoted in table [ tab : xycoefficients ] and show that the experimental determination might be not unique in a strict sense .",

    "@xcite and @xcite have to be considered with care .",
    "indeed we find that @xmath6 and @xmath82 are not simply related by a flavour rotation ; in our calculation , the radial amplitudes of these isoscalar states differ considerably .",
    "therefore , adopting the general mixing scheme of eq .",

    "we found considerable differences between the spectra of model @xmath83 and model @xmath94 : the masses of all @xmath307 ground states were significantly lowered in model @xmath94 so that the assignment of possible @xmath8 states in this puzzling sector will differ in both models .",

    "a further topic is the study of strong decays in this framework .",
    "hereby , it is of special interest that not only pure quark loops contribute to the strong decay widths , but also instanton  induced six  quark interactions will occur .",

    "in this appendix , we present a model  independent factorization proof for the asymptotic limit ( @xmath196 ) of the pseudoscalar transition form factor @xmath310 at equal photon virtualities .",
    "we stress that the following considerations are formulated on the basis of full four  dimensional bethe  salpeter amplitudes and quark propagators so that it will be independent of the instantaneous approximation that we adopted for our numerical evaluations .",
    "let us start with the matrix element @xmath316 in eq .",
    "( [ matrixelement ] ) for the decays @xmath153 with @xmath311 at arbitrary photon virtualities @xmath317 .",
    "we define @xmath318 and consider the decaying meson in its rest frame with @xmath223 . with @xmath319 and @xmath320 , we then find the following relations for @xmath321 : @xmath322 here , we have chosen the photon momenta to be in the direction of the @xmath323axis .",
    "we now study the behaviour of the intermediate propagator in both terms of the matrix element @xmath316 in eq .",
    "( [ matrixelement ] ) .",
    "the denominator behaves like @xmath324 for asymptotic photon virtualities since terms proportional to the relative momentum @xmath18 will not contribute due to the vanishing vertex function for @xmath325 . for the same reason ,",
    "only a @xmath326 term survives in the numerator ( `` @xmath327 '' for @xmath16 , `` @xmath328 '' for @xmath17 ) .",
    "therefore we find for the complete intermediate quark propagator @xmath329 inserting this in the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ matrixelement ] ) , we find @xmath330\\ ] ] for asymptotic virtualities .",
    "since we are dealing with virtual photons , the polarization vectors @xmath331 do not only have transversal but also longitudinal components .",
    "however , if one of the photons is longitudinally polarized with @xmath332 , the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ tasympt ] ) will cancel .",
    "the same happens for @xmath333 so that we conclude @xmath334 where , as usual , @xmath335 .",
    "here and in the following , the upper sign ( `` @xmath328 '' ) stands for polarization vectors @xmath336 and @xmath337 , while the lower sign ( `` @xmath327 '' ) applies to the choice @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "the resulting integrand is equivalent to the expression for the pseudoscalar decay constants in eq .",

    "if we consider the process @xmath342 , the sum becomes trivial and contains only the pion decay constant @xmath119 multiplied by the factor @xmath343 .",
    "we note that we have introduced the charge factors @xmath344 that are proportional to the factors defined in section [ gammagammadecay ] .",
    "now we recall the relation between the matrix element of the two photon decay and the transition form factor in eq .",

    "since we have set the photon momenta as @xmath345 , we can evaluate the implicit sum over the indices @xmath346 and @xmath25 .",
