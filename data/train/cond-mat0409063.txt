    "in recent years the concept of a luttinger liquid ( ll ) as a realistic model of interacting electrons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) metallic structures has received experimental support ( see e.g. refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "quantum wires ( qw ) in laterally constrained 2d electron gases ( 2deg ) and single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) - are the two best known structures where ll behavior has been established both theoretically and experimentally .    in swnts , where the interaction effects have been shown to be strong@xcite , interactions influence the charge and spin transport through the nanotube . when a repulsively interacting ll is coupled to leads ( m ) of noninteracting electrons , two qualitatively different regimes of charge transport may be realized depending on the quality of the ll / m electrical contacts . for tunnel contacts",
    "charge transport through the system is strongly suppressed at low temperatures and bias voltages@xcite by the repulsive electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction .",
    "in contrast , for adiabatic contacts when electron backscattering is negligibly small , the conductance is not renormalized by the interaction@xcite .",
    "these two types of charge transport behavior also characterize the superconducting properties of a ll wire coupled to superconductors . for adiabatic contacts only andreev scattering of electrons occurs at the boundaries between ll and bulk superconductors ( ll / s boundaries ) .",
    "this process does not lead to a redistribution of charge density along the wire and therefore the coulomb interaction does not influence the supercurrent through a perfect ll .",

    "we consider the influence of spin - orbit ( s - o ) interaction on the josephson current through a long s / i / ll / i / s junction .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the s - o interaction is strong in a 2deg formed in a gaas / algaas inversion layer ( the rashba effect @xcite ) and that it can be controlled by a gate voltage@xcite . in what follows",
    "we will consider a quantum wire in a laterally confined 2deg coupled to superconducting electrodes via tunnel barriers .",
    "the influence of the rashba effect on the electron spectrum and on the transport properties of quasi-1d quantum wires has been studied theoretically in refs .  [ ] , where it was shown that the s - o interaction not only splits the electron spectrum into spin-``up '' and spin-``down '' subbands , but additionally breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "this implies that left- and right - moving electrons with the same spin projection have different fermi velocities . since the time invariance ( t - symmetry ) of the spin - orbit hamiltonian implies that @xmath3 and @xmath4 the strength of the rashba effect in a single - channel qw can be characterized by a dispersion asymmetry parameter @xmath5 . in refs .",
    "[ ] it was assumed that in the presence of rashba interactions the electron spins in a quasi-1d wire are aligned as in the 2d case ( see fig.[fig1 ] , solid lines for spin projections ) .",
    "although this assumption is not valid for a strong rashba coupling@xcite , the model considered by the authors of these references is interesting in itself .",
    "it allows one to study the effects of dispersion asymmetry ( @xmath6 ) on the electron dynamics and in the limit @xmath7 it reproduces the standard results for spin-1/2 electrons without s - o interaction .    .",
    "in the case of weak rashba interaction spin projections in the subbands for each given momentum are opposite . for strong rashba interaction spins in subbands are parallel and they are opposite for right- and left - moving particles.,width=302 ]    since the electron spin is not conserved in the presence of s - o interactions the classification of spin states assumed in refs .",
    "[ ] is not evidently correct . actually , as was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , it can be justified only for a weak rashba interaction . in the most interesting case of strong rashba interaction , when the characteristic energy scale introduced by s - o coupling is compared with the energy spacing of 1d subbands , the average spin projections for electrons with large ( fermi ) momentum are different .",
    "the total energy is minimized when all right - moving ( r ) electrons have parallel spins and they are in the opposite direction to the spins of left - moving ( l ) electrons@xcite . in what follows",
    "we choose the sign of the rasha interaction so that r - electrons have `` down''-spin and l - electrons are `` up''-spin particles ( see fig.[fig1 ] , dashed lines for spin projections ) .",
    "notice that under conditions when the rashba effect is active the electron spin lies in a ( 2d ) plane and orthogonal to the electron momentum ( in the 1d case this direction is fixed and `` up '' and `` down '' spin projections are well defined ) .",
    "at first we consider the influence of electron dispersion asymmetry in the model elaborated in refs . [ ] on the superconducting properties of s / i / ll / i / s junction .",

    "when dispersion asymmetry is negligibly small ( @xmath7 ) we reproduce the formula for josephson current derived in ref .

    "the zeeman interaction in the absence of rashba effect results only in additional sign alternating harmonic factor in the critical current ( see also refs . [ ] ) .",

    "the interplay of dispersion asymmetry and the zeeman interaction leads to beatings in the supercurrent considered as a function of the local magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "a more unusual prediction is the appearance of supercurrent @xmath19 even at @xmath20 .",
    "the existence of this anomalous josephson current is related to the breaking of chiral invariance in quasi-1d quantum wires and the effect manifests itself already for noninteracting particles ( see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "a more realistic geometry for an s / ll / s junction is a finite ll wire ( of the length @xmath21 ) coupled via tunnel barriers to bulk superconductors ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the barrier transparencies are unequal and small ( nonsymmetric tunnel junction @xmath22 ) and evaluate the @xmath23-dependent part of the ground state energy in perturbation theory using the junction transparency @xmath24 as expansion parameter .",
    "normal and andreev scattering at the interfaces can be taken into account by the boundary terms@xcite in the hamiltonian of the s / i / ll / i / s junction . to first order in the junction transparency the problem",
    "is reduced to the evaluation of four - fermion correlation functions for a two channel ll hamiltonian with the boundary conditions implying the absence of particle current through the s / ll interfaces at @xmath25 . in the absence of spin - orbit interaction",
    "the problem of quantization of plasmon modes in a finite ll with open ends was solved in ref .",
    "[ ] . here , we generalize the quantization procedure proposed in the cited paper to the case of spin-1/2 fermions with dispersion asymmetry .",
    "the two - channel ll hamiltonian describing our system is diagonalized exactly by the canonical transformation suggested in ref .",
    "we show that the spectrum of plasmons in a ll with open ends in the presence of dispersion asymmetry is determined by a transcendental equation . in the general case the spectrum forms a set of quasi - random energy levels . for noninteracting electrons , or",
    "when the energy dispersions are symmetric ( @xmath26 ) , the spectrum is reduced to a set of equidistant energy levels . in the limit of strongly interacting particles",
    "the plasmon spectrum also becomes regular .",
    "we calculate the josephson current in the cases when the spectral equation can be solved analytically .",
    "coupled to bulk superconductors via tunnel barriers with transparencies @xmath27 .",
    ", width=302 ]    we find that for noninteracting electrons the critical josephson current through a tunnel s / qw / s junction is enhanced by the presence of dispersion asymmetry .",
    "this behavior is specific for 1d electrons and the effect disappears in 2d junctions@xcite .",
    "when the rashba effect is not pronounced ( @xmath28 ) , the josephson current through a tunnel s / ll / s junction is described by an expression analogous to the formula derived for an effectively infinite ll .",
    "however , the interaction - induced renormalization ( suppression ) of the critical supercurrent is much stronger for a finite ll than for an infinite one @xmath29 provided the electron - electron interaction is short - ranged .    as already mentioned in the introduction , the electron spin states in a 1d quantum wire in the regime of strong rashba effect are fully determined by s - o interaction and the electrons with large ( fermi ) momenta behave as truly chiral particles .",
    "that is the electron spin polarizations and the direction of their motion ( right / left ) are strongly correlated and all right(left)- moving particles , irrespective of their fermi velocities , have parallel spins@xcite which are opposite to the spin polarizations of left(right)-moving electrons .",
    "so it is reasonable to expect that in this case the magnetic field via the zeeman interaction will induce an anomalous supercurrent ( at @xmath20 ) even in the absence of dispersion asymmetry .",
    "we calculate the josephson current in a sillis junction in a model when the rashba s - o interaction is smoothly switched on in a 1d qw and spin - flips are not accompanied by electron backscattering",
    ". an anomalous influence of zeeman splitting on the critical supercurrent is predicted .",
    "it is physically evident that the coulomb interaction in a long s / i / ll / i / s junction suppresses the critical supercurrent due to a strong kane - fisher renormalization of the bare tunneling matrix elements .",
    "the josephson current through a luttinger liquid coupled to bulk superconductors via tunnel contacts was first calculated by fazio _",
    "et al._@xcite who showed that the critical supercurrent is multiplicatively renormalized ( suppressed ) by a repulsive electron - electron interaction .",
    "the calculations were performed in linear ( fig.[fig2 ] ) and ring - like geometries . in both cases",
    "periodic boundary conditions for the plasmonic modes can be imposed .",
    "although from an experimental point of view the considered geometries of an sns junction look rather artificial , they do allow one to simplify the calculations .    for noninteracting electrons the critical supercurrents in an sns junction formed by a long ( effectively infinite ) quantum wire connected to superconductors by side tunnel contacts ( separated by a distance @xmath21 ) and in an sns junction where a finite length qw bridges the gap ( of the same length l ) between two superconductors differ only by a numerical factor .",
    "if the qw is treated as a luttinger liquid this factor becomes a function of the interaction strength and can be evaluated analytically ( see below ) .",
    "when both electron - electron interactions and dispersion asymmetry are present the calculations are more cumbersome .",

    "( [ ps ] ) has to be solved numerically and the plasmon spectrum represents a set of quasi - random energy levels .",
    "the plasmonic energies can not be separated into two independent sets of levels - one for charge density excitations , another for spin density excitations .",
    "it means that the considered boundary conditions strongly mix the charge and spin excitations and the phenomena of charge - spin separation , well known in a ll , generally speaking , can disappear when both spin - orbit interaction and finite size effects are present .",
    "it is clear from a physical point of view that the effects of a dispersion asymmetry in the bare electron spectrum have to be most significant in the quantum dynamics of noninteracting electrons . in this case",
    "the mismatch in fermi velocities when an electron is backscattered at the boundaries leads to an intricate interference pattern .",
    "the more strongly particles interact , the less important are the effects of dispersion asymmetry .",
    "for instance , in the limiting case of a 1d wigner crystal ( strong repulsive long - range interactions ) it is hard to imagine any interference produced by the quantum dynamics of plasmons in two wigner crystals pinned by structural imperfections at the boundaries .",
    "so in our problem it is reasonable to expect the restoration of the regular plasmon spectrum and the spin - charge separation in the limit of strong interaction .    for strongly interacting electrons @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( i.e. for week or moderate dispersion asymmetry ) the coefficient @xmath197 ( intra - channel backscattering probability ) in eq .",

    "this observation ( see also ref .  [ ] ) justifies for strongly interacting multichannel ( @xmath201 ) ll the boundary conditions ( @xmath202 ) usually postulated in the literature ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] ) for arbitrary interaction .",

    "the result for zero zeeman splitting ( @xmath97 ) is @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the critical current through a 1d sns junction and the interaction - induced renormalization factor @xmath205 is @xmath206 here @xmath85 is the hypergeometric function and @xmath18 is the ll correlation parameter ( see eq .",

    "@xmath213 is the critical current in the absence of dispersion asymmetry ( see eq .",
    "( [ jf ] ) ) and @xmath214 is the renormalization factor induced by the asymmetry of electron dispersion @xmath215 we see from eq .",
    "( [ ra ] ) that the dispersion asymmetry always slightly enhances the critical current .",
    "the analysis of the josephson current in a 1d sqws junction in the presence of dispersion asymmetry was performed in ref .",
    "[ ] using the andreev level approach .",
    "it was shown that the observed enhancement of the josephson current is due to less perfect cancellations ( different fermi velocities ) of the partial supercurrents carried by adjacent andreev levels .",
    "now we consider the limit of strong rashba interaction . in this case",
    "the electrons in a quasi-1d quantum wire behave like truly chiral particles , that is the spin polarization of an electron irrespective of its subband index is determined by the direction of electron motion along the wire  right - moving and left - moving electrons have opposite spin projections@xcite .",
    "we will assume for definiteness ( it depends on the sign of rashba coupling ) that `` r''-electrons are `` down''-polarized and `` l''-electrons are `` up''-polarized ( see fig.[fig3 ] , dashed lines for spin polarizations ) .",
    "we have already seen in section ii , that the left / right symmetry breaking in the presence of the zeeman interaction results in the appearance of an anomalous josephson current .",
    "physically it means that when the spin projection is correlated with the direction of motion ( left , right ) , the magnetic field , via the zeeman interaction , induces partial josephson currents ( for each subband `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' ) even if the superconducting phase difference in the sns junction is zero . for the spin alignments assumed in refs .",
    "[ ] the subbands contribute to the josephson current with opposite signs and therefore the anomalous supercurrent vanishes for symmetrical spectrum @xmath115 . as we see , the electron dispersion asymmetry is indispensible property to get anomalous josepson current for a weak rashba interaction . in the limit of strong s - o interaction",
    "when all right(left ) moving particles have parallel spins , the contributions of subbands have the same sign and the existence of electron dispersion asymmetry ceases to be crucial in appearence of anomalous ( at @xmath216 ) josepson current",
    ".    what is more important are the spin - flip processes which may take place in the transition regions between the 2d or 3d electron reservoirs ( superconducting leads in our case ) and the 1d quantum wire with a pronounced rashba effect .",
    "the electrons in the reservoirs have two possible spin states , while deep inside the wire , where the s - o interaction is strong , the electron spins have to be aligned according to the above discussed prescription .",
    "so particles with the `` wrong '' spin projection should turn their spins toward the `` right '' direction .",
    "one can imagine two different types of transition regions . in the case",
    "when s - o interaction is changed abruptly at the lead / wire interfaces , the spin - flips induced by the rashba interaction will be accompanied by normal electron backscattering .",
    "such non - adiabatic contacts were studied in ref .  [ ] when evaluating normal electron transport through a 1d quantum wire with strong rashba interaction attached to leads where the s - o interaction was assumed to be negligibly small . in this model",
    "the transparency of the junction strongly depends on the spin - orbit coupling and normal electron transport is suppressed even for perfect contacts .    here",
    "we will assume that the rashba interaction in the qw is switched on smoothly and that therefore the backscattering of the electron at the boundary and the rotation of its spin induced by the rashba interaction the in quasi-1d quantum wire are spatially separated .",
    "for instance , the left - moving electron ( spin-``up '' ) at first is normally backscattered at the left interface keeping the spin-``up '' and then after travelling some length @xmath217 its spin becomes `` down''-polarized . in this model",
    ", the rashba interaction does not lead to additional electron backscattering at the interfaces and does not suppress the supercurrent .",
    "it is also convenient for calculations to assume that the electron - electron interaction in the 1d qw is strong .",
    "as was shown in section iv , the interchannel electron backscattering at the i / ll interfaces is suppressed in the limit of strong repulsive interaction and one can use a simple quantization procedure proposed in ref .  [ ] to evaluate the plasmon spectrum and the correlation functions .",
    "after straightforward calculations the desired expression for the josephson current takes the form @xmath218",
    "\\cos\\left[\\frac{\\delta_z}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta_{l1}}- \\frac{1}{\\delta_{l2}}\\right)\\right ] , \\ ] ] where the interaction - induced renormalization coefficient @xmath219 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ rf1 ] ) .",
    "as was already evident from physical considerations , the anomalous supercurrent @xmath220 in the limit of strong rashba interaction is induced by a magnetic field ( @xmath221 ) even in the absence of electron dispersion asymmetry .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ jr ] ) that the dependence of the supercurrent on magnetic field is absolutely different for chiral and normal electrons .",
    "in particular the critical current for symmetric electron spectrum ( @xmath115 ) in the case of chiral electrons does not at all depend on the zeeman splitting , while in the ordinary situation one gets a periodic dependence .",
    "the problem we have studied allows one to consider the interplay of proximity - induced superconductivity , the rashba , zeeman and coulomb interactions on the transport properties of quasi-1d quantum wires .",
    "we have shown that the rashba and zeeman effects strongly influence the supercurrent .",
    "in particular , the rashba effect in quantum wires results in a strong correlation between electron spin polarization and the direction of electron motion .",
    "in other words a strong rashba interaction creates chiral particles in the 1d electron system .",
    "the influence of a magnetic field via the zeeman interaction on chiral particles leads to the appearance of a net electric current in the wire .",
    "when the leads that the quantum wire is attached to are superconducting this current persists even at zero phase difference across the junction .",
    "the effect exists already for noninteracting particles and it is strongly sensitive to the electron dispersion asymmetry for weak rashba coupling and ceases to depend on the asymmetry parameter in the regime of strong rashba interactions .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the josephson current in a perfectly transmitting junction ( i.e. without normal electron backscattering ) is not influenced by the coulomb interaction .",
    "in contrast , any potential barrier inside the normal region which induces electron backscattering is renormalized ( upwards ) by the repulsive interaction ( the kane - fisher effect@xcite ) and therefore strongly suppresses the supercurrent through a ( poorly transmitting ) sillis junction @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the electron dispersion asymmetry , which is induced by the rashba interaction in quasi-1d quntum wires@xcite is significant for the superconducting properties of a ll junction only for weak or moderate coulomb interaction . in this case",
    "the interplay of interaction and dispersion asymmetry leads to an intricate interference pattern in the plasmon quantum dynamics of a finite length two - channel ll and makes the plasmon spectrum quasi - random .",
    "strong coulomb interactions suppress this kind of quantum behavior and restores a regular ( equidistant ) plasmon spectrum .",
    "the tendency of strong coulomb interactions to suppress quantum interference can be traced in different 1d electronic systems , for instance , in a ll double barrier ( absence of resonant tunnelling for a strong repulsive interaction@xcite ) or in mesoscopic coupled rings ( ordering effect of coulomb interaction on persistent current oscillations@xcite ) .",
