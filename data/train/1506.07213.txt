    "in magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , a strongly magnetic ( @xmath01200 mg ) white dwarf primary accretes matter from a roche - lobe filling secondary .",
    "intermediate polars ( ips ) are a subset of magnetic cvs in which the spin period is significantly shorter than the orbital period .",
    "when the magnetically controlled accretion flow hits the white dwarf surface , a strong standing shock forms .",
    "the predominant cooling mechanism of shock - heated plasma in ips is the collisionally excited , thermal , multi - temperature x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "since the shock is formed near the stellar surface , we expect that roughly half the intrinsic emission is directed towards the primary and is reprocessed and/or reflected .",
    "the strongest spectral signatures of reflection are the 1030 kev compton reflection hump and the fe k fluorescent line at 6.4 kev .",
    "while the latter are routinely detected from magnetic cvs , they can also originate from intrinsic absorbers .",
    "the importance of reflection has nevertheless been inferred through a statistical analysis of the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line vs. absorbing column @xcite .",
    "a direct detection of the compton reflection hump in magnetic cvs has largely been elusive to date , due to a lack of x - ray spectra of sufficient quality above 10 kev .",
    "positive detections are reported for am  her @xcite and for ef  eri @xcite . however , the studies on am  her used single - temperature models as the basis ; @xcite also started with this model , and although they also explored reflection of the expected multi - temperature emission , the data were not good enough to distinguish between the two .",
    "@xcite found residuals around the fe k complex in their study of v1223  sgr using _ ginga _ data , and interpreted it as due to reflection .",
    "however , they were unable to verify this through the detection of the characteristic spectral curvature of reflection on the higher energy side of the 1030 kev hump .",
    "previous hard x - ray data on these magnetic cvs generally had poor signal - to - noise ratios and suffered from systematic uncertainties of background models . with the advent of _ nustar _ , the first mission to extend the energy range for imaging x - ray observations up to @xmath079 kev , we can obtain much improved hard x - ray spectra",
    ". it also enables a reliable study of spin modulation of x - rays above 10 kev . in this letter , we present the initial results from our joint observations of 3 ips using _ nustar _  @xcite and _ xmm - newton _  @xcite , and report the unambiguous detection of compton reflection hump in all three targets .",
    "we have selected v709  cas , ny  lup , and v1223  sgr as our targets for this study , because they have the highest observed 14195 kev _",
    "swift_/bat fluxes according to @xcite .",
    "we have observed them jointly with _ nustar _  and _ xmm - newton _  during the summer of 2014 , always with periods of simultaneity ; the observations are summarized in table[obstab ] . in this letter , we present only the _ nustar _  and the _ xmm - newton _  epic data .",
    "_ nustar _  consists of two co - aligned telescopes and the two focal plane modules , fpma and fpmb .",
    "we reduced the _ nustar _",
    "data using the _ nustar _  data analysis software ( nsutardas v1.4.1 ) available as a part of heasoft v6.16 and latest caldb files .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "observations were taken during intervals of normal solar activity , and we used standard filtering to remove periods of high background during south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) passages and earth occultation . for each source",
    ", we used a 70  radius circular region around the known position , and a 100  radius , circular , source - free background region on the same detector .",
    "we generated the spectra , corresponding response files and light curves using nuproducts .",
    "we grouped all spectra using grppha to have at least 25 counts per bin , and used the @xmath2 statistic in spectral fitting .",
    "we produced background - subtracted , barycenter - corrected light curves in the 310 kev and 1030 kev energy bands for all three ips .",
    "we processed the _ xmm - newton _  data with sas version 13.0.0 using the latest calibration files available in november 2014 .",
    "all observations were performed with the epic cameras ( pn and two mos ) in small window imaging mode to avoid pile - up , with the thin filter applied ( with the exception of v709  cas , where the medium filter was used ) .",
    "we confirmed that none of the observations was affected by pile - up following the thread procedure .",
    "then , we extracted the source spectrum from a circular region of radius 40 , centered at the known source position . the background was obtained from a nearby source - free region of the same size for pn and 150  for the moss . for the spectral analysis",
    ", we cleaned the observation of v709  cas that was affected by background flares , by applying an intensity threshold , thereby retaining only the first @xmath3 ks .",
    "we grouped spectral channels with the specgroup tool so as to have a minimum of 25 and 15 counts per bin for the pn and moss , respectively .",
    "for the timing analysis , we applied the barycentric correction using barycen and produced background subtracted light curves in the 0.33 , and 310 kev ranges using the task epiclccorr .",
    "initially , we concentrated on what we could infer purely from the _ nustar _  data . for this",
    ", we excluded the fe k region ( 5.58.0 kev ) , and the data below 4.5 kev , and approximated the interstellar plus intrinsic absorber using a single phabs model . to fit the continuum , we used 3 different models with different degrees of curvature : a power law , a cooling flow model ( mkcflow ) , and a single - temperature bremsstrahlung .",
    "we then modeled reflection using the convolution model reflect @xcite , with the abundances fixed to solar as determined by @xcite .",
    "we also fixed the inclination angle of the reflecting surface at the default value of cos @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "we fitted the data once with the reflection amplitude fixed to 0.0 , and once with the amplitude thawed .    in table[restab",
    "] , we report the best - fit @xmath6 and the degree - of - freedom of the latter case , the difference in @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) compared to the no reflection case , and the best fit reflection amplitude with the 90% confidence error range .",
    "the choice of continuum model affects the @xmath7 values , with the bremsstrahlung continuum presents the stringent test of reflection ( the smallest @xmath7 ) .",
    "nevertheless , reflection is detected with high significance for all 3 models and for all 3 objects ( at a significance of 1@xmath8 , for v709  cas fitted with bremsstrahlung model , or higher , using the f - test ) .",
    "we also illustrate the improvement visually in ( figure[nuonly ] ) using the single - temperature bremsstrahlung case .",
    "the residuals against the reflection - less model ( middle panels ) clearly show the continuum reflection hump , peaking around 20 kev .",
    "we are not aware of any explanation of the high energy end ( @xmath030 kev ) of the observed hump other than compton reflection .",
    "we conclude that , with _ nustar _  data alone , we have achieved an unambiguous detection of reflection in all three ips .",
    "however , intrinsic absorbers in ips are complex and often include components with n@xmath9  @xmath0a few times 10@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "such absorbers affect the observed continuum up to @xmath06 kev and also create an fe k edge at 7.0 kev @xcite .",
    "we must determine the depth of the fe k edge due to these compton - thin absorbers before we can place quantitative constraints on the reflection amplitude ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "we also performed simple phenomenological fits to the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic spectra in the 59 kev region , where multiple emission lines are evident . using a bremsstrahlung continuum modified by a single phabs absorber",
    ", we clearly detected the h - like ( 7.0 kev ) , he - like ( 6.7 kev ) , and near neutral , fluorescent ( 6.4 kev ) lines in all 3 objects , which is typical for ips @xcite .",
    "the first two indicate the presence of kt@xmath010 kev and @xmath05 kev plasmas , respectively .",
    "the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line was found to be 105@xmath1211 ev , 132@xmath1212 ev and 90 @xmath1218 ev , respectively , for v709  cas , ny  lup , and v1223  sgr .",
    "any absorbers capable of producing an fe k edge will necessarily absorb soft x - rays below 2 kev almost completely . on the other hand ,",
    "many ips often exhibit additional spectral complexities below 1 kev , such as the soft , blackbody - like component ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the complex absorber may be ionized ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this initial study , we have therefore opted to fit _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic ( pn , mos1 and mos2 ) spectra in the 1.510 kev range simultaneously with the _ nustar _  ( both modules ) spectra in the 3.578 kev range .",
    "our preliminary analysis down to 0.3 kev confirms that the choice of low energy threshold does not significantly affect the depth of the fe k edge in the model .    for these joint fits , we used two different combinations of models . in the first case ( `` 2 t '' ) , we approximated the underlying multi - temperature thermal emission , evidenced by the presence of h - like and he - like fe lines , using two mekal @xcite components of different temperatures .",
    "a single absorber is clearly inadequate to describe the data , so we approximated the complex absorber using one fully covering and one partial - covering absorbers .",
    "we applied the reflect model to the 2 mekal models and added a gaussian to represent the 6.4 kev line of cold iron .    in the second case ( `` mkcflow '' ) , we modeled the underlying multi - temperature plasma emission using the isobaric cooling flow model , mkcflow @xcite . although we expect post - shock plasma to cool to the photospheric temperature of the primary , the data above 1.5 kev have no sensitivity to plasma temperatures well below 1 kev .",
    "we therefore used a fixed minimum temperature of 0.0808 kev , the lowest value allowed by the mkcflow model .",
    "the intrinsic absorption in ips is likely to occur in the immediate pre - shock flow , which is poorly approximated by one or several discrete partial - covering absorbers : @xcite pointed this out and provided a complex absorber model with an power - law distribution of covering fraction as a function of n@xmath9 , pwab .",
    "we used pwab with minimum n@xmath9  set to 1.0@xmath13 @xmath11 ( effectively 0.0 ) as well as a phabs to model the interstellar absorption .    in both these models",
    ", we allowed the overall abundances of the thermal emission to vary ( linked between the two mekal components for the `` 2 t '' model ) , which is necessary to reproduce the strengths of the h - like and he - like fe lines .",
    "moreover , we assumed that the reflection was from the part of the white dwarf surface that is covered by freshly accreted material , with the same abundances as the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "we initially fixed the angle of reflection at cos @xmath14=0.45 as before .",
    "we allowed the cross - normalization factor relative to _ nustar",
    "_  fpma to vary , to allow for source variability and for the current limitation in the cross - calibration of these instruments @xcite .",
    "the best - fit values were all found to be within a few percent of 1.0 .",
    "however , we found several specific manifestations of cross - calibration limitations at , e.g. , 710 kev .",
    "this is the likely reason why the joint _ nustar_/_xmm - newton _  fits results in with @xmath15 , which might otherwise suggest that these fits are unacceptable .",
    "we summarize the reflection amplitudes and other selected results in table[restab ] , and show the results for v1223  sgr in figure[nux ] .",
    "the derived reflection amplitudes are lower than in _ nustar_-only fits , because our full fits indicate the presence of a complex intrinsic absorber up to n@xmath9  @xmath0a few times 10@xmath10 @xmath11 , which the _ nustar_-only fits did not account for .",
    "correspondingly , these fits result in smaller but still statistically significant values of @xmath7 .",
    "we also note that there is good agreement in the reflection amplitude between the two models for v709  cas and for v1223  sgr , and that they are significantly less than 1.0 : @xmath00.65 ( 0.450.9 ) for v1223  sgr and @xmath00.35 ( 0.10.6 ) for v709  cas . for ny  lup ,",
    "the different models disagree but the reflection amplitude appears to be @xmath160.8 , possibly as high as 1.8 . alternatively , if we allow for different viewing geometry , we can obtain fits with similar quality with reflection amplitudes @xmath01 . for ny  lup fitted with mkcflow ,",
    "this can be achieved with @xmath17 , resulting in a reflection amplitude of 0.831.20 . for v709  cas and v1233  sgr ,",
    "the data can be reconciled with reflection amplitudes of @xmath01.0 only with edge - on ( @xmath18 ) geometries .",
    "finally , we note that we do not confirm the previous claim of an ionized fe k edge at @xmath08.0 kev in v709  cas @xcite .",
    "energy - dependent x - ray spin modulation is a defining characteristic of ips , and is generally understood as due to variable complex absorber @xcite .",
    "this mechanism predicts small or negligible spin amplitudes above 10 kev .",
    "the only previous claim of spin modulation above 10 kev is for v709  cas , which shows @xmath1610 kev modulation in phase with the lower - energy modulation in the non - imaging _ rxte _  and _ beppo - sax _  ( pds ) data @xcite . to confirm this earlier results , and to search for subtle spin modulation in the other objects , we folded the _ xmm - newton _  and _ nustar_light curves in three energy bands ( figure[spin ] ) on the known spin periods of 312.75 s for v709  cas @xcite , 693.01 s for ny  lup @xcite , and 745.63 s for v1223  sgr @xcite , using the integer part of modified julian date of the starting time of each observation as the epoch of phase 0.0 .",
    "we found the pulsed fractions of 1030 kev spin modulation to be 17.0@xmath121.7% , 11.6@xmath121.6% , and 4.2@xmath121.1% , respectively , for v709  cas , ny  lup , and v1223  sgr , using the definition in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our result for v709  cas is consistent with that of @xcite . in ny",
    "lup , the 1030 kev spin modulation is roughly sinusoidal and in phase with the modulation below 10 kev ; the 1030 kev modulation of v1223  sgr is the weakest and non - sinusoidal ( figure[spin ] ) .",
    "the reflection signal is expected to be the strongest normal to the reflecting surface , even before taking projection effect into account @xcite , with limited energy dependence .",
    "@xcite chose cos @xmath4 as the default for their xspec model as having a spectral shape close to the ensemble average . in our fiducial fits",
    ", we used this default and found the reflection amplitude to be @xmath11.0 in v709  cas and v1223  sgr , and high ( quite possibly @xmath161.0 ) in ny  lup .",
    "however , the primary surface can cover at most 2@xmath19 steradian of sky .",
    "our data on ny  lup can be reconciled with this if the viewing geometry is more face - on ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this would be the case if the binary inclination ( @xmath20 ) is @xmath21 and the co - latitude of the emission region ( @xmath22 ) is small , which we believe is plausible for ny  lup .",
    "if we force the reflection amplitude to be 1.0 in v709  cas and v1223  sgr , the spin - averaged @xmath14 must be @xmath23 .",
    "this would require either a nearly aligned rotator seen edge - on or equatorial emission regions seen pole - on . however , our data are also consistent with non - negligible shock height .",
    "unfortunately , given the abundance and n@xmath9  values we infer , we can not make a strong inference on the importance of reflection based on the equivalent widths of the 6.4 kev lines ( see figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we use the spin modulations to break this degeneracy .    the soft x - rays ( @xmath110 kev ) are modulated predominantly due to photoelectric absorption and are at a minimum when the upper pole ( the pole on the hemisphere nearer the earth ) points most directly towards us @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath14 dependence of reflection should produce a hard x - ray maximum at this phase , resulting in anti - phased spin modulations between the soft and the hard bands . since this is contrary to what we observe (  3.3 ) , the hard x - ray spin modulations have a different mechanism .    for ny",
    "lup and v1223  sgr , the observed hard x - ray spin amplitudes are of order 10% or less .",
    "the complex absorbers we infer for these objects ( table[restab ] ) may produce a spin modulation of such amplitudes via compton scattering ( figure 6 of @xcite ) , provided that the angle - dependent reflection effects are small ( i.e. , the range of @xmath14 must be small ) .",
    "finite shock height is another potential mechanism for spin modulation @xcite .",
    "if the shock height is negligible , as is often assumed in studies of reflection and spin modulations , the horizon is 90@xmath24 from zenith and the primary surface covers 2@xmath19 steradian , implying a reflection amplitude of 1.0 .",
    "moreover , in a pure dipole geometry , one and only one pole is observed at all phases , as the disappearance of one behind the primary rim exactly coincides with the the appearance of the other .",
    "once we relax this assumption , the horizon is @xmath1690@xmath24 from zenith , the surface covers @xmath25 steradian , and there is a range of viewing angles where the x - rays from both emission regions are simultaneously observable .",
    "this leads to an energy - independent spin modulation , since this effect is purely geometrical .    to explain the hard x - ray spin modulation of v709  cas , already known to be non - sinusoidal from _ rosat _  data @xcite",
    ", @xcite proposed that its shock height is @xmath00.2 white dwarf radii ( r@xmath26 ; see their figure 9 ) .",
    "such an x - ray source has a horizon angle of 123.5@xmath24 , both poles are observable at the viewing angles of 66.5@xmath24123.5@xmath24 , and the reflection amplitude is 0.45 .",
    "this scenario provides an explanation for our observation that the reflection amplitude is low , the 6.4 kev line is relatively weak , and the spin modulation is even above 10 kev .",
    "the shock in ny  lup appears much closer to the primary surface . as for v1223  sgr",
    ", a characteristic height of 0.05 r@xmath26 would result in a reflection amplitude of 0.7 , consistent with the data assuming a non - edge - on viewing geometry , and a horizon angle of 107.7@xmath24 .",
    "the geometry of v1223  sgr is poorly known ; we believe that there are plausible combinations of @xmath20 and @xmath22 ( e.g. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) such that the lower pole is never visible .",
    "we can then explian the observed spin modulation as due primarily t the compton scattering mechanism .",
    "we have unambiguously detected the continuum reflection bump in all three ips we observed jointly with _ nustar _  and _ xmm - newton_. for two of them , v709  cas and v1223  sgr , either we view the reflecting surface edge - on or the reflection amplitude is low . considering also the high energy spin modulation we detect in v709  cas , we argue that a post - shock region with a significant height above the white dwarf surface can explain all available data .",
    "we plan to continue our analysis using the _ xmm - newton _  rgs and om data , using epic data down to the lowest energy , and performing spin - phase resolved spectroscopy of epic and _ nustar _  data , to investigate if this framework can provide a quantitative description of the data .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained with the_nustar _  mission , a project led by the california institute of technology ( caltech ) , managed by the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) and funded by nasa .",

    "<S> in magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , x - ray emission regions are located close to the white dwarf surface , which is expected to reflect a significant fraction of intrinsic x - rays above 10 kev , producing a compton reflection hump . </S>",
    "<S> however , up to now , a secure detection of this effect in magnetic cvs has largely proved elusive because of the limited sensitivity of non - imaging x - ray detectors . here </S>",
    "<S> we report our analysis of joint _ nustar_/_xmm - newton _  observations of three magnetic cvs , v709  cas , ny  lup , and v1223  sgr . </S>",
    "<S> the improved hard x - ray sensitivity of the imaging _ nustar _   data has resulted in the first robust detection of compton hump in all three objects , with amplitudes of @xmath01 or greater in ny  lup , and likely @xmath11.0 in the other two . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm earlier report of a strong spin modulation above 10 kev in v709  cas , and report the first detection of small spin amplitudes in the others . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this as due to different height of the x - ray emitting region among these objects . </S>",
    "<S> a height of @xmath00.2 white dwarf radii provides a plausible explanation for the low reflection amplitude of v709  cas . </S>",
    "<S> since emission regions above both poles are visible at certain spin phases , this can also explain the strong hard x - ray spin modulation . </S>",
    "<S> a shock height of @xmath00.05 white dwarf radii can explain our results on v1223  sgr , while the shock height in ny  lup appears negligible . </S>"
