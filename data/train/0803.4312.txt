    "the first phase of the super - kamiokande experiment , sk - i [ 1 - 2 ] , yielded high precision measurements of the solar neutrino flux . in spite of the loss of numerous photomultipler tubes [ pmt ] sustained in an accident , sk continued to collect data with reduced photo - cathode coverage and a higher energy threshold .",
    "data collection and analysis methods had to be revised due to the loss of detector sensitivity .",
    "super - kamiokande s second phase [ sk - ii ] ran from december 2002 to october 2005 .    throughout this paper , the methods and results of sk - ii are compared with sk - i and , when differing , are detailed for sk - ii .",
    "it was determined that the november 12th , 2001 accident sustained by the sk detector was caused by a propagating shock wave initiated by an imploding pmt located at the bottom of the inner detector .",
    "therefore , blast shields were installed to protect the pmts against such a chain reaction .",
    "these shields are 1.0 cm - thick transparent acrylic domes allowing light to pass to the pmts photo - sensitive surface .",
    "this presents an additional medium through which cherenkov light must travel .",
    "reflection and refraction of light on the acrylic surface is accounted for in the sk - ii geant 3 monte carlo detector simulation .",
    "the acrylic shields transparency at normal incidence is better than 98% above 400 nm in wavelength .",
    "it is about 86% at 300 nm .    for light propagation in water , both sk - i and sk - ii adopt a 3-part model of light attenuation consisting of rayleigh scattering , mie scattering , and absorption .",
    "we consider two types of absorption : long wavelength ( @xmath3 350 nm ) and short wavelength ( @xmath4 350 nm ) absorption . in the long wavelength absorption region",
    ", we utilize an independent model derived using direct measurements from an integrating chamber absorption meter [ icam ] applied to pure water  @xcite . scattering coefficients and absolute short wavelength absorption are tuned to reproduce energy distributions in linac calibration data ( see section ii.c for a description of the linac data ) . at short wavelengths , the sk - i model varies the absorption coefficient to describe the changing sk in - tank water transparency as measured by decay electrons from cosmic - ray muons . in sk - ii ,",
    "the best description has no short wavelength absorption but increased scattering .",
    "figure  [ fig : absorption ] shows the attenuation model in both short and long wavelengths for sk - ii .    in determining the expected solar neutrino flux spectrum for a range of oscillation parameters ,",
    "sk - ii follows the method of sk - i : the total @xmath0b and hep flux values of the bp2004 standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite are used with the neutrino spectrum based on the @xmath5-delayed @xmath6 spectrum of @xmath0b decay by ortiz  @xcite to calculate the flux of a particular energy bin .",
    "the uncertainties of the neutrino spectrum are taken from bahcall  @xcite .",
    "the determination of event vertex , direction , and energy with the reduced light collection capability of sk - ii has prompted the development of new reconstruction methods .",
    "for vertex reconstruction , the efficiency of the sk - i standard vertex fit significantly drops at energies below the sk - i analysis threshold of 5.0 mev . with 40% photocathode coverage",
    ", this corresponds to roughly 25 pmt signal hits . at 19% coverage in sk - ii ,",
    "25 hits translates to 8 mev .",
    "the timing residual in an event is defined as the time difference between a pmt s hit time @xmath7 and the emission time @xmath8 ( fitted to minimize all timing residuals ) minus the time it would take cherenkov light to reach that pmt given the event s vertex @xmath9 in the tank : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vector location of the hit pmt and @xmath12 is the group velocity of light in water .    in sk - i , vertex reconstruction is accomplished by selecting a limited number of hit pmts from an event ( to reduce bias from pmt dark noise and scattered light hits ) and calculating a goodness relation based on the timing residuals of the selected hits and a candidate vertex @xmath9 .",
    "a systematic grid search of candidate vertices is performed until the goodness reaches a maximum value .",
    "after that , the vertex position is fine - tuned to further maximize the goodness .",
    "the sk - i reconstruction will not attempt a vertex fit for less than 10 hits .",
    "in contrast , the sk - ii reconstruction uses all hits from an event to form the timing residuals for determination of the vertex position .",
    "bias from pmt dark noise is reduced by constructing a likelihood describing the shape of the timing residual distribution from linac calibration data .",
    "this likelihood is then maximized from a vertex search based not on a grid pattern but from a list of vertex candidates calculated from pmt hit combinations of 4 hits each .",
    "the four - hit combinations each define a unique vertex given their timing constraints .",
    "any event with four hits or more is reconstructed .",
    "sk - ii also makes use of the sk - i goodness - grid search method in its online and initial offline analysis for filtering background events .",
    "the final reconstruction , or the standard fit based on the residual likelihood method , is the final determination of vertex position and can also be seen as a correction for any misreconstructed events which survived the filtering process .",
    "figure  [ fig : bonsai_resolution ] shows the various vertex resolutions for the sk - ii vertex reconstruction .",
    "the uncertainty of the measured solar neutrino rate due to systematic shifts in vertex position is estimated to be 1.1% .    both sk - i and sk - ii utilize a fast fit online reconstruction method for pre - filtering low energy events .",
    "details can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "from the correct vertex ) of @xmath0b monte carlo events as a function of total recoil electron energy . ]",
    "the direction reconstruction is identical to the sk - i method : a likelihood function is used to compare cherenkov ring patterns between data and mc distributions .",
    "opening angles between the particle direction and reconstructed vertex - to - hit pmt position are scanned using grid searches at varying levels of precision .",
    "the sk - ii standard fitter is used to determine the vertex . the absolute angular resolution ( defined as the maximum angular difference between 68% of the reconstructed and true event directions as determined by mc ) of sk - ii differs from sk - i by about 10% and is mostly limited not by detector coverage but by multiple scattering of electrons in the tank .",
    "the difference between data and mc angular resolutions , however , is greater in sk - ii due to the larger discrepancies in energy scales between data and mc .",
    "therefore , we assign an angular resolution systematic error of 6.0% .",
    "angular resolution is shown in figure  [ fig : direction_resolution ] .",
    "the reconstruction of event energy is identical to that of sk - i with modification specific to sk - ii ( photo - cathode coverage , blast shields , etc . ) . from the number of in - time hit pmts ( coincident within 50 ns ) from an event ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "various corrections are made .",
    "the resulting effective hit sum has a consistent value throughout the detector for a given event ( @xmath14 ) . from @xmath14 , we determine energy .",
    "refer to  @xcite for specific information on the conversion from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath14-to - energy conversion function must be modified for sk - ii due to smaller values of @xmath14 corresponding to equivalent energies with larger @xmath14 in sk - i .",
    "this is done by generating mc events at discrete input energies between 5 and 80 mev , calculating their @xmath14 values , and then interpolating the energy function . as with sk - i",
    ", energy refers to total energy of the event ( kinetic energy plus electron rest mass ) .    since the corrections in @xmath14",
    "depend on the water transparency , the reconstructed energy also varies slightly with changing water quality .",
    "see figure  [ fig : water_transparency ] for @xmath14 as a function of time for a given water transparency .",
    "when calculating energy for data events , the water transparency value as determined by decay electrons from cosmic - ray muons is used as an input parameter . however ,",
    "for mc events , the change in water transparency is not simulated due to its relative stability compared to sk - i and a calculated , constant value of 101 m is used for all mc events in the analysis .        an analytical function of the detector s energy resolution can be determined with the same mc events used for the @xmath14-to - energy conversion function .",
    "the energies of the mc events are calculated from the method described above and their fitted gaussian mean energy and corresponding 1 sigma values are plotted for each discrete energy .",
    "a sigma function @xmath15 is then fitted to use in a normal gaussian probability density function @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the electron s true recoil energy and @xmath18 is the reconstructed energy . the function @xmath15 for sk - ii",
    "is given by @xmath19 in units of mev .",
    "the sk - i resolution is @xmath20 .",
    "both resolutions are shown in figure  [ fig : eres_function ] .",
    "equation  [ eq : eres1 ] with equation  [ eq : eres2 ] can be used to apply the sk resolution when calculating theoretical spectra for comparison with sk data .          as with sk - i ,",
    "the primary instrument for energy calibration in sk - ii is an electron linear accelerator [ linac ] .",
    "detailed discussions on the linac calibration methods can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "electrons are injected into the sk tank at various positions ( see figure  [ fig : linac_diagram ] ) at energies between 5.8 and 13.4 mev . after reconstructing the energies of linac events ,",
    "these data are compared with mc to determine the deviation in energy scales .",
    "various mc parameters are then adjusted to minimize the differences ( see section ii.a ) .",
    "the minimum uncertainty in the sk - ii absolute energy scale using 13.4 and 8.8 mev linac data is calculated to be 1.4% .",
    "this is in contrast to the sk - i estimated value of 0.64% .",

    "@xmath21n is also used as a calibration source in conjunction with the linac calibration  @xcite .",
    "@xmath21n is produced by lowering a deuterium - tritium neutron generator into the tank and initiating the fusion reaction @xmath22h@xmath23h@xmath24he@xmath25 .",
    "a fraction of these 14.2 mev neutrons collide with @xmath21o in the water to produce @xmath21n which then decays with a half - life of 7.13 seconds . in most cases",
    ", the q - value is shared between 6.1 mev gamma rays and a @xmath5-decay electron .",
    "@xmath21n decays allow directional studies on the energy scale not capable with the unidirectional linac beam . at a total @xmath21n decay product energy of 10.4 mev ,",
    "observed energy at several tank positions is compared with mc - simulated energy and the difference is shown to agree with those obtained from linac data and mc .",
    "the @xmath21n energy scale difference is averaged to be @xmath261.2% compared with linac s @xmath261.4% .",
    "in addition , the isotropic @xmath21n data are divided into zenith angle bins to show the relative asymmetry of the energy scale .",
    "these show asymmetries within @xmath260.5% ( figure  [ fig : linac_dtg ] ) and are similar with sk - i values .",
    "quantitative representations of trigger efficiencies are also obtained from @xmath21n data .",
    "the lowest threshold where the sk - ii trigger is 100% efficient is 6.5 mev whereas the sk - i threshold is 4.5 mev .",
    "figure  [ fig : trigger_efficiency ] shows the trigger efficiencies for sk - ii .",
    "a systematic error is assigned to the trigger efficiency by comparing the value given by @xmath21n data and mc - simulated trigger events ( 0.5% on the total flux measurement ) .",
    "n calibration data and the lines are the best - fit error functions to the data ( red solid is le and green dashed is sle ) . ]",
    "like sk - i , sk - ii has two levels of triggering for solar neutrino analysis : low energy [ le ] and super - low energy [ sle ] thresholds which require a minimum of about 14 and 10 hit pmts respectively to register an event . at the beginning of data taking in december 2002 ,",
    "only the le trigger threshold was applied . at and above 8.0 mev",
    "is where the le trigger is 100% efficient .",
    "later , the threshold was lowered and sle data was taken with 100% efficiency at 6.5 mev . ultimately , the le+sle analysis threshold was set to 7.0 mev due to the large number of background events below this level .",
    "the le analysis period lasted from december 24th , 2002 to july 14th , 2003 for an exposure of 159 live days .",
    "the le+sle period lasted from july 15th , 2003 until october 5th , 2005 for an exposure of 632 live days .",
    "sle triggered events are filtered online to reduce the amount of data written to limited storage space .",
    "events reconstructed outside the fiducial volume are rejected .",
    "the data are reduced by a factor of approximately six .",
    "see fig  [ fig : bonsai_resolution ] for the vertex resolution as a function of energy of the online fitter .      for sk - ii",
    ", we implement a new two - part cut of events based on defined goodness functions of pmt timing and hit patterns .",
    "many background events remain due to mis - reconstruction after the usual two - meter fiducial volume cut , ( which reduces background coming from the pmts and blast shields . )",
    "whereas a gamma - ray cut solely relies on vertex and directional reconstruction , the 2-dimensional timing - pattern cut removes those events whose reconstruction should not be trusted .",
    "an optimized hit pmt timing goodness is defined ( equation  [ eq : goodness ] ) by comparing two timing residual gaussian distributions , one with a width of @xmath27 5 ns to encompass selected hits and the other with a @xmath28 60 ns width characteristic of the pmt timing resolution for a single photo - electron :    @xmath29    the effective hit time is defined as @xmath30 which is just the timing residual @xmath31 of equation  [ eq : t_residual ] with added @xmath8 .",
    "the sums are over all hits .",
    "the hit pattern goodness allows us to identify cherenkov events by their azimuthal - symmetric ring pattern from a reconstructed vertex and direction .",
    "all others are labeled mis - reconstructed or non - cherenkov events .",
    "a goodness function @xmath32 is defined for all directional events .",
    "a cut on the goodness values is made in tandem using a hyperbolic radius of @xmath33 and rejecting all other events .",
    "figure  [ fig : dirks ] shows this background reduction cut on data and @xmath0b monte carlo in the 7.0 - 7.5 mev bin . when the cut is applied to linac data and mc , a total flux systematic error of @xmath263.0% is obtained .",
    "the timing - hit pattern cut is treated as a second reduction after the removal of noise and spallation events from the initial data set .",

    "oscillations of solar neutrinos have been studied by numerous experiments and have placed increasingly stringent constraints on the mixing angle between neutrino mass and flavor eigenstates as well as neutrino mass difference . in the statistically large data sample of sk - i , those constraints , assuming two flavor oscillations , favor the large mixing angle [ lma ] region at 95% confidence level .",
    "the best fit values are given in the lma region at @xmath36=0.52 and @xmath37 .",
    "the favored regions and corresponding best fit value are from a fit to the sk - i spectrum and time variation rates .",
    "the @xmath0b flux is also constrained by the sno total rate  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters ( @xmath38 ) in sk - ii is accomplished in much the same way as the previous sk - i result . two neutrino oscillation is assumed and for each set of oscillation parameters , a @xmath35 minimization of the total @xmath0b and hep neutrino flux is fit to the data .",
    "the entire sk - ii observed spectrum is utilized from a 7.0 mev threshold .",
    "the expected oscillated @xmath0b and hep flux is derived from numerically calculated msw  @xcite @xmath39 survival probabilities and the unoscillated flux provided by the ssm .",
    "it is then converted to an expected sk - ii rate spectrum by utilizing the @xmath40 elastic scattering cross section and the sk - ii detector s energy resolution . to account for the systematic uncertainties in energy resolution as well as the energy scale and the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum model shape ,",

    "the last term is the unbinned time - variation likelihood to the sk - ii solar zenith angle flux variation above a 7.5 mev threshold .",
    "this likelihood is analogous to the one used in sk - i .",
    "the energy uncorrelated systematic uncertainty is assigned to 4.8% ( the quadrature sum of the energy independent errors in table i ) and is used to describe the error on the total rate . for the spectrum rate uncertainties , the value 4.8% is conservatively assigned to each bin and is added in quadrature to the statistical error ( table ii ) to equal @xmath55 in the sk - ii @xmath35 .",

    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows both excluded and allowed regions at 95% confidence level .",
    "they are consistent with previous sk - i results .",
    "the primary constraint in sk - ii is from the time - variation data although some spectral exclusion is also seen at @xmath56 .",

    "the combination of other solar neutrino experiments such as the sno and radiochemical results with the sk combined analysis is accomplished by fitting the total cc and nc rates observed by sno s 306-day pure d@xmath59o  @xcite and 391-day salt phases  @xcite .",
    "also , the sno nc constrained predicted day - night asymmetry for the pure d@xmath59o phase is used for added exclusion power . the radiochemical experiments of homestake , gallex , and sage  @xcite are then added using the best @xmath0b and hep fluxes from the sk - sno fit .",
