    "self - avoiding walks have been widely studied as models of polymers in dilute solution@xcite . a self - avoiding walk on a lattice",
    "is defined as a random walk which is forbidden from visiting the same lattice - site more than once@xcite . in the limit of very long",
    "walks it models a polymer in a good solvent . in order to model",
    "the relative affinity between the monomers ( compared with the solvent ) an attractive energy is introduced between non - consecutively visited nearest - neighbour sites@xcite .",
    "this is the standard @xmath0-point model . at high temperatures the polymer is happy to be in solution .",
    "as the temperature is lowered the polymer tends to collapse in on itself , and at a given temperature will precipitate from solution . for an idealised infinitely long polymer",
    "the high temperature and low temperature regimes are separated by a phase transition occurring at a temperature known as the theta temperature , @xmath1@xcite . in the grand - canonical description",
    "the average length of the walk is controlled by a fugacity @xmath2 ( or chemical potential @xmath3 where @xmath4 ) . at high temperatures",
    "the ( average ) length of the walk diverges smoothly as a critical fugacity @xmath5 is approached . at low temperatures",
    "the length jumps discontinuously at a given value of the fugacity @xmath6 ( corresponding to a first order transition ) .",
    "the two lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 follow continuously one from the other , and the two behaviours are separated by a tricritical point , at a temperature corresponding to @xmath1 . the transition line @xmath5 then @xmath6 is identified with the `` thermodynamic limit '' of the polymer problem .",
    "along this line , the proportion of visited sites is zero for @xmath7 and becomes non - zero continuously for @xmath8 .    while it is clear that the main experimental interest lies in three dimensions ( although there are some experimental results also in two dimensions@xcite ) , there has been a lot of theoretical interest in the two dimensional case@xcite .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that the upper critical dimension for a tricritical point is three@xcite . in dimensions",
    "lower than three ( but larger than one ) there is a possibility for a greater diversity of critical behaviours .    in this article",
    "we investigate a two - dimensional model with a restricted set of interactions , compared to the theta model ; an interaction is only present between nearest - neighbour non - consecutively visited sites belonging to straight portions of polymer , i.e. an interacting site can not sit on a corner of the walk ( see ) .",
    "this choice of interactions may be motivated by the rle of hydrogen bonding in the formation of secondary structures in proteins@xcite .",
    "these bonds are formed between the * co * group of one peptide and the * nh * group of a nearby ( non - consecutive ) peptide .",
    "this bond imposes a constraint on the orientation of the relevent peptides .",
    "this type of bonding is thought to be responsible for the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets@xcite . in our two - dimensional toy - model",
    "the formation of alpha helices is not possible .",
    "a representation of the formation of a beta sheet through hydrogen bonding is shown in .",
    "our main interest in this paper is not to give a realistic model for protein folding , but rather to understand the influence of these apparently small modifications to the local attractive interactions on the critical behaviour of lattice interacting self - avoiding walks . to this end",
    "we present the phase diagram and elucidate the critical behaviour in the full fugacity  temperature plane .    in the following section we present in detail the model as well as the transfer matrix calculation of the quantities of interest . in section  [ pd ]",
    "we present the phase diagram and discuss the different transitions present . in section  [ hamilt ] we concentrate more specifically on the hamiltonian walk limit of the model in which all sites are visited exactly once . in section  [ conc ]",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks .",
    "the model studied here consists of a self - avoiding walk embedded on a square lattice .",
    "an interaction energy @xmath9 is assigned for each non - consecutively visited pair nearest - neighbour sites for which the four bonds are parallel ( see ) .",
    "a chemical potential , @xmath3 , and related fugacity @xmath4 are associated to each step .    , configurations of types ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) interact in the standard @xmath0-point model , but here do not participate in hydrogen type bonding.,width=264 ]    the grand canonical partition function is then @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of steps in the walk and @xmath12 is the number of interactions .",
    "quantities of interest may be calculated as appropriate derivatives of the partition function , for example , the density is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the relative length fluctuations are related to the derivative of @xmath15 through : @xmath16 .    in the dilute polymer regime ( small enough @xmath2 )",
    "the correlation function may be identified with the probability that two given points are joined by a walk . in this case",
    "the correlation length must scale in the same way as any reasonable characteristic length scale associated to the walk .",
    "it is usual to take the radius of gyration , which corresponds to the average squared distance the walk steps from the common centre of gravity .",
    "it follows that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is defined as the standard correlation length exponent@xcite . using the relation",
    ", one finds @xmath19 from which we may see that the walk is fractal ; the mass of the walk scales linearly with @xmath11 , and hence @xmath20 .",
    "the fractal ( haussdorf)@xcite dimension of the walk is then @xmath21@xcite .",
    "it is usual in such problems to take equation as the definition of the exponent @xmath18@xcite . in this case , note that it only relates to the usual critical exponent in the case of a critical transition in the dilute regime . in the collapsed phase(s )",
    "the polymer fills the lattice , the mass scales as @xmath22 and equation gives @xmath23 .    in this article",
    "we propose to use a transfer matrix formalism to calculate @xmath24 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath25@xcite . for convenience we shall from now on set @xmath26 , which simply corresponds to a choice of temperature scale .    the idea behind the transfer matrix formalism is to calculate the partition function on a lattice which is infinite in one direction ( the @xmath27 direction , say ) but finite in the other ( @xmath28 ) direction",
    "the thermodynamic limit is attained by increasing the lattice width .    the standard way of considering the problem is as follows : define the restricted partition function @xmath29 as the partition function for a portion of walk between the origin and @xmath27 .",
    "the walk has a column state @xmath30 at the origin and @xmath31 in column @xmath27 .",
    "one may then write the following recursion relation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the additional boltzmann weight to add column @xmath34 in configuration @xmath35 next to column @xmath27 in configuration @xmath36 .",
    "this forms a ( transfer ) matrix .    that this recursion should be valid for a spin system",
    "is fairly straightforward , since the interactions are all local . for a polymer model",
    "it is less clear that this should be possible , since one has to take into account non - local factors , most notably one has to ensure that the partition function describes only one chain , without the formation of `` orphan '' loops . this is done by appropriately defining the column states @xmath36 . for the self - avoiding walk problem with no added interactions",
    "( i.e. @xmath37 ) it is sufficient@xcite to define a column configuration by the arrangement of horizontal bonds in the column along with information about the connectivities between the bonds , that is information about which pairs of horizontal bonds are connected by polymer loops to the left ( taking @xmath27 as increasing towards the right ) .",
    "see for an example . by successive application of",
    ", one finds @xmath38        the situation becomes a little more complicated if interactions are to be taken into account .",
    "it is necessary to know the column states over three columns in order to incorporate the horizontal bonds .",
    "the appropriate modification to the above equations is@xcite : @xmath39 and @xmath40 the primed configurations are introduced to retain the matrix notation , the elements of the matrix are now labelled by the two column states for the input and two for the output ( primed ) , with the restriction that only matrix elements with @xmath41 may be non - zero .",
    "it is required that the partition function sum over walks of all possible lengths . to do this",
    "we define a restricted partition function @xmath42 for all the walks having a caliper extension @xmath27 , i.e. walks which are entirely confined to a strip of length @xmath27 , and extend over the entire length of the strip .",
    "this is simply @xmath43 summed over all configurations @xmath30 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath36 compatible with the starting and ending configurations of the walk . the full partition function is then given by @xmath46 where the primed sum is over the boundary configurations , as described above .",
    "let us denote by @xmath47 the eigenvalues of @xmath48 , numbered in order of their moduli .",
    "the eigenvalue of largest modulus , @xmath49 , is always positive .    for small enough @xmath2 , @xmath50 .",
    "in this case the partition function may be written @xmath51 the @xmath52 are essentially constants dependent on the boundary conditions , which gives for the density : @xmath53 if the derivative of @xmath54 is finite , which is the case at least for small enough @xmath55 , the density is zero as long as @xmath56 and may only change from its zero value when the average length of the walk diverges , i.e. @xmath57@xcite .",
    "the point @xmath58 is identified with the critical transition , and is often used in polymer science to define the `` thermodynamic limit '' of `` very long '' polymers@xcite .",
    "another way of reaching to the same conclusion is to consider two points as being correlated if they are joined by a walk .",
    "one may then identify @xmath43 with a two point correlation function , and hence identify the correlation length , @xmath59@xcite : @xmath60 the correlation length diverges as @xmath61 , consistent with the identification of a critical transition .",
    "the above argument needs to be treated with caution .",
    "as long as the lattice width is finite , the system is equivalent to a one - dimensional system with a finite , if large , number of states per site ( each site corresponding to a column in our model ) .",
    "it is well known that a one dimensional system with a finite number of states per site can not have an equilibrium phase transition@xcite .",
    "the reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the definition of @xmath59 is not valid in the large @xmath2 phase ( dense polymer phase ) . in a spin model",
    "the partition function would have been given by @xmath42 in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "the transfer matrix would contain all the possible configurations , and a standard analysis shows that@xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the largest eigenvalue , and @xmath49 is the second largest ( in modulus ) . to ensure the correct construction of a single walk",
    "all configurations consisting of an empty column have been excluded from the transfer matrix , but replaced by the sum over all possible polymer extensions @xmath27 .",
    "the consequence of this choice is that the largest eigenvalue in the zero - density phase has been eliminated .",
    "its value , as can be seen by inspection of the expression for @xmath59 , would be @xmath65 .",
    "this prescription only holds as long as @xmath56 . if @xmath66 then the partition function , density and @xmath59 are given by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the lattice width .    for convenience",
    "we impose the condition that the walk of extension @xmath69 in the @xmath27 direction originates at @xmath70 and terminates either at @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "as is usual in equilibrium phase transitions , the precise choice of boundary condition does not change the critical behaviour . imposing this restriction",
    "it is easy to see that column configurations with even numbers of horizontal bonds may only follow column configurations with even numbers of horizontal bonds , and likewise for configurations with an odd number of horizontal bonds .",
    "this block diagonalisation is convenient since it transpires that for much of the phase diagram @xmath49 and @xmath72 arise in different blocks .",
    "it is relatively easy to calculate the largest eigenvalues of a matrix using the power method@xcite .",
    "the critical lines may be identified using phenomenological renormalisation@xcite . at a critical point",
    "the correlation lengths for two strip widths , measured as a fraction of the strip width , must be the same .",
    "this reflects the scale invariance of a critical system . in practice",
    "a finite width system is always off - critical , however @xmath74 gives a finite - size estimate of the critical fugacity , @xmath75 , which will tend to the true critical fugacity as the strip widths tend to infinity . assuming that the system is sufficiently close to the true critical point , the correlation length behaves ( to leading order ) as @xmath76 since it is the finite width of the system which prevents the correlation length from diverging , at @xmath75 we have @xmath77 .",
    "if these two scaling laws are admitted , then a finite - size estimate of the correlation length exponent may be calculated from the equation : @xmath78     +    there exists at least one phase transition . in the case",
    "@xmath79 this corresponds to the standard self - avoiding walk transition .",
    "as @xmath55 is increased , this point extends into a line of critical points . in analogy to the standard @xmath0-point model , we would expect this transition to change to first order at some given value of @xmath80 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , starting from the low - k phase , the correlation function is given by .",
    "in the high - k phases the appropriate form of @xmath59 is given by .",
    "the phase diagram estimates found using phenomenological renormalisation , using the appropriate form of @xmath59 , are shown in . as is usual in this sort of problem , there are strong parity effects , notably for the odd lattice widths @xmath49 is in the odd sector of the transfer matrix , while for the even lattice widths @xmath49 is taken from the even sector .",
    "the next largest eigenvalue , @xmath72 , is in the other sector for the low-@xmath2 phase and for the high temperature high-@xmath2 phase , while it is in the same sector for the high-@xmath2 low temperature phase .",
    "this observation was not used to estimate the transition lines , which were however found assuming that @xmath49 and @xmath72 came from different sectors of the transfer matrix .",
    "not all the transition lines are found for even lattice widths .",
    "+   ( top ) , and density fluctuations ( bottom ) for the inverse temperature @xmath81 , title=\"fig:\",width=483 ]    let us now characterise the different phases and transitions . for low @xmath2",
    "the average length of polymer is finite , the density of the polymer on the lattice must therefore be zero .",
    "the first transition as @xmath2 is increased is to one of two dense phases , depending on whether @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "it is convenient to use the density as an order parameter . for practical reasons we choose boundary conditions in which the polymer is made to extend the length of the lattice , between @xmath70 and @xmath84",
    "this obliges the polymer to be infinite in length even in the zero - density phase .",
    "a choice of boundary conditions is not expected to affect the critical behaviour of an equilibrium system .",

    "the density will now be finite for @xmath86 as long as the lattice width is finite , but must tend to zero as @xmath87 .",

    "the line is in the self - avoiding walk universality class , having @xmath91 as may be seen from the finite size estimates for @xmath18 shown in .",
    "the transition is to a finite density phase .",
    "for @xmath83 the density plot , given in , indicates that the transition is first order to a dense phase . that this line corresponds to the compact polymer state",
    "is confirmed by the observed exponent @xmath92 , see . a major difference with the @xmath0-point model , seen using",
    "the phenomenological renormalisation scheme is the existence of two different high density phases .",
    "the density plots in for @xmath83 suggest that the walk changes discontinuously from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , and that the density of interactions saturates instantly . in other words",
    "the lattice changes abruptly from being essentially empty to essentially full , with a maximum density of interactions .",
    "trivially , a lattice which is empty ( a finite walk length on an infinite lattice ) has zero energy and zero entropy per site ; the free energy per site is zero .",
    "if the lattice is completely full with the interactions density saturated , the walk may only be in one of two configurations ; either all the bonds are vertical or all the bonds are horizontal .",
    "the entropy per site in this phase is therefore also zero .",
    "since , in this state , there is one bond and one interaction per site , the energy per site is @xmath95 .",
    "the transition between the two phases would then occur when the free energy per site , @xmath96 , in other words when @xmath97 . remembering the choice @xmath26",

    "this line has been plotted for comparison on the phase diagrams , shown in .",
    "the agreement with the observed first - order transition line is excellent .    in order to differentiate between the two high density phases , it is convenient to use the interaction density , @xmath89 , as an order parameter",
    "this order parameter , along with its fluctuations , is plotted as a function of @xmath55 for @xmath90 in .",
    "the order parameter differentiates between the two phases since it is identically one in the high-@xmath55 phase , and less than one in the low-@xmath55 phase .",
    "the variation of the order parameter appears to be fairly smooth for all lattice sizes , and leads one to conjecture that this high density transition is critical .",
    "also plotted in is the specific heat , calculated as the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the temperature , keeping @xmath3 and @xmath99 constant .",
    "various estimates of the critical @xmath55 for @xmath90 , calculated using the phenomenological renormalisation group and by locating the peaks in the specific heat , are given in .",
    "the various results are coherent with an estimate @xmath100 . at a critical transition ,",
    "the specific heat diverges as @xmath101 with an exponent @xmath102 , @xmath103 when combined with relation and @xmath104 , this leads to the finite - size scaling result @xmath105 a three point fit for odd widths gives @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 . a similar three point fit for the even sizes",
