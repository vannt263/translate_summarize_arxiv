    "since the first observational detection of brown dwarfs - objects whose mass ( @xmath00.08 m@xmath1 ) is too small for them to achieve hydrogen fusion but larger than the majority of known planets - the mechanism for their formation has been a hotly pursued and elusive puzzle .",
    "current theories include formation of very low - mass cores in turbulent clouds ( e.g. padoan and nordlund , 2004 ) , additional fragmentation in higher - mass cores ( e.g. boss 2002 ) , fragmentation out of high mass discs ( e.g. rice et al .",
    "2003 ) , premature ejection from a natal cloud core ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "2002 ) , and photo - erosion of cores by nearby ob stars ( e.g. whitworth and zinnecker , 2004 ) . over the past few years",
    ", extensive surveys of star - forming regions have been undertaken to identify larger numbers of vlm members ( e.g. zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2000 , ardila et al .",
    "2000 , luhman 2004a , guieu et al . 2006 ) .",
    "by studying the properties of brown dwarfs and vlm stars at very young ages , one may gain substantial insight into their origins .",
    "one such property that is useful for gaining this insight is multiplicity fractions of vlm stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "many formation scenarios make predictions as to the percentage of these objects that would be expected to be found in binaries . a number of field vlm star and brown dwarf multiplicity studies have been carried out and have found very low overall binary fractions ( @xmath55 - 10@xmath6 ) , mass ratio distributions that are strongly peaked toward equal masses , and a sharp decline in the binary fraction beyond separations of 20 au ( e.g. burgasser et al . , 2003 , close et al . , 2003 , bouy et al . , 2003 , gizis et al .",
    "2003 ) . when compared with higher mass studies of field stars ( e.g. duquennoy @xmath7 mayor 1991 ) ,",
    "these suggest that the maximum binary separation decreases with mass . however , these results may be affected by dynamical evolution given the substantial age of the targets .",
    "indeed , multiplicity studies of stellar objects have shown evidence for dynamical evolution , as the binary fraction of these objects is generally found to be much higher in young star - forming regions than in the field ( e.g. ghez et al .",
    "1993 , leinert et al .",
    "1993 , simon et al .",
    "thus , surveys of younger ( @xmath51 - 5 myr ) vlm systems are much more likely to reveal the pristine outcome of the brown dwarf formation process .",
    "such work has just begun over the last few years and includes studies in upper scorpius ( distance = 145 pc , age @xmath5 5 myr ; kraus et al .",
    "2005 , bouy et al .",
    "2006 ) and taurus ( distance = 140 pc , age @xmath51 - 5 myr ; kraus et al .",
    "to date , only a handful of young , vlm binaries have been detected .    in this paper , we report the discovery of five new vlm binaries in taurus .",
    "in contrast to field vlm binaries , the majority of these new binaries have separations greater than 20 au .",
    "these new binaries increase the number of known young systems by @xmath550@xmath6 and suggest a higher binary fraction among young , vlm objects . in @xmath82 , we describe our observations and analysis , in @xmath83 we present our results , in @xmath84 we compare our results to other work and discuss the implications for brown dwarf formation scenarios , and in @xmath85 we summarize our findings .",

    "this value is a factor of two less and 2.2@xmath4 lower than the young , vlm binary fraction .",
    "in addition to the binary fractions discussed above , the properties of vlm systems , namely the separation and the mass ratio , show differences as a function of age .",
    "figure 1 plots the binary mass ratio for the young and field surveys discussed above , along with three other binaries discovered with high angular resolution imaging ( luhman 2004b , chauvin et al .",
    "2005 , white et al . 1999 ,",
    "bouy et al . 2006 ) , as a function of separation .",
    "in contrast to the field population , young , vlm binaries frequently have separations larger than 20 au , as well as smaller ( more unequal ) mass ratios .",
    "this suggests that the young vlm binaries are wider and have a flatter mass ratio distribution than field binaries , or equivalently that many of the young vlm binaries have smaller binding energies than their older counterparts .",
    "the differences in these parameters are quantified with both one - dimensional and two - dimensional k - s tests , comparing the separations and mass ratio distributions of these field vlm binaries with the young vlm binaries . in one dimension ,",
    "the separation distributions have a 1@xmath6 probability of similarity and the mass ratio distributions have a 0.02@xmath6 probability of similarity .",
    "additionally , in two dimensions , the distribution of both parameters taken together has only a 0.07@xmath6 probability of similarity .",
    "thus , we can say with a fairly high degree of certainty that the properties of young vlm binaries differ substantially from those of old vlm binaries .",
    "these differences support the idea that there may be substantial evolution in the properties of vlm binaries @xmath55 - 10 myr after their formation ( burgasser et al .",
    "2006 ) . the disruption of binaries with separations greater than 20 au via interactions with their environment , i.e. their formative cluster , shortly after their initial formation would seem to be a plausible zeroth - order explanation for the disparity . as further evidence of this idea ,",
    "if we assume that evolution will eventually lead to the disruption of the four binaries found here with separations greater than 20 au , we can calculate a new binary fraction - the fraction that will survive to eventually become a field binaries .",
    "this leaves a total of four out of 45 binaries , which yields a binary fraction of 9 @xmath9 5@xmath6 .",
    "this number is perfectly consistent with the field binary fraction we calculate above .",
    "however , the situation becomes substantially more complicated when comparing vlm binaries to stellar binaries . as noted by both close et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and burgasser et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , there appears to be a discrepancy between the minimum observed binding energy of stellar binaries and vlm binaries .",
    "this binding energy discrepancy is shown in figure [ be ] .",
    "three of the binaries discovered here have a binding energy below the previously determined limit , with a minimum around @xmath2910@xmath30 erg .",
    "this minimum is still quite discrepant from what is observed amongst field binaries , which appear to have a minimum binding energy of about @xmath2910@xmath31 erg .",
    "the stellar binding energy cutoff can be explained by the work of weinberg et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , who show that normal interactions with the other stars and giant molecular clouds in the galaxy typically provide a `` velocity kick '' of less than 1 km s@xmath32 , sufficient to truncate a stellar mass binaries with separations beyond @xmath50.1 pc .",
    "however , generating a binding energy cutoff like that observed amongst the vlm binaries necessitates a velocity kick roughly three times this value",
    ".    one method of generating the higher velocity kicks for vlm objects is from the ejection scenario for vlm star and brown dwarf formation ( bate et al .",
    "2002 ) , which predicts typical velocity kicks of @xmath53 km s@xmath32 very early in the formation process .",
    "however , numerous authors have noted the implausibility of the ejection scenario , as it predicts not only a very low frequency of binary brown dwarf systems ( 5@xmath6 or less ) , but also generates binary brown dwarfs with separations of less than 10 au .",
    "although recent work by umbreit et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows that it is possible to form more brown dwarf binaries via ejection than initially assumed , they find a semi - major axis distribution that is severely truncated at wider separations , with no brown dwarf binaries created at separations greater than 20 au .",
    "while this new study initally seemed a promising solution to the binding energy problem , it does not explain the young , wide binaries plotted in figure [ young_compare ] .",
    "a reasonable explanation of the binding energy discrepancy must now include the survival of some vlm binaries of separations greater than 20 au up through at least a few million years after formation while at the same time account for the truncation seen in the field . on a number of occassions , the low - mass , low - density nature of taurus",
    "has been invoked to explain difference observed between the multiplicity properties of the region and regions like the high - density orion .",
    "thus , it could be argued that the multiplicity of vlm objects found in this study is not directly comparable to field vlm objects , which would most likely have formed in higher mass star forming regions .",
    "however , the similarity of the results presented here to those found in upper scorpius make this an unsatisfactory explanation - indeed , it has been argued that orion is in fact also an unusual star - forming region and most stars form in intermediate mass regions like upper scorpius ( e.g. kroupa 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the existence of wide vlm binaries in numerous star - forming regions seems to be a significant trend .",
    "the statistical significance of the trucation of wide , vlm field binaries both now in terms of their younger counterparts and stellar binaries therefore necessitates a plausible physical explanation for their disappearance over a longer timescale than has been previously suggested . as mentioned above , the work of weinberg et al .",
    "( 1987 ) suggests that disruption of such binaries once they survive to become field objects is unlikely .",
    "in addition , although their eventual disruption could potentially be due to interactions within star forming regions before they disperse , kroupa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show from dynamical simulations that although many vlm binaries would be disrupted in very high density regions like the orion nebula cluster , the majority will not be disrupted in regions like taurus .",
    "disruption alone thus does not appear to be the cause of the discrepancy .    however , the dynamical events a vlm binary undergoes throughout its time in its formative cluster and its eventual evolution into a field object is clearly not so simple as it becoming either disrupted or not .",
    "most interactions will have an effect on the properties of the binary , namely in terms of hardening or softening .",
    "thus , it could be that the impact of such interactions will be greater on a vlm binary than on a stellar binary as a result of their small size relative to the average perturbing object .",
    "for instance , hills ( 1990 ) shows that the fractional change in binding energy is a fairly strong function of the ratio of the mass of the binary to the mass of the perturber , which would imply that hard vlm binaries on average get `` harder '' more quickly that stellar binaries .",
    "such parameter evolution , first occuring in a star - forming region and then later in the field , could potentially account for some of the binding energy discrepancy .",
    "for instance , the simulations of adams et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that interaction and disruption cross - sections in a star - forming region scale roughly as the square root of the mass of the primary star .",
    "more detailed calculations that take into account the effects of the relative mass of the binary with respect to the rest of the cluster and subsequently the field population should be performed to test these effects .",
    "in a survey of thirteen newly - discovered vlm members of the taurus star - forming region , we identified five new binary systems .",
    "follow - up observations are still required to confirm that these binaries are associated .",
    "proper motion measurements would provide the most definitive confirmation .",
    "additional constraints could be applied in the interim by obtaining either colors or spectral types for the secondaries in these systems .",
    "still , statistical arguments show that they are associated to a high degree of certainty . as a result of these discoveries ,",
    "we were able to statistically compare the properties of young , vlm binaries to their older counterparts in the field .",
    "we found that our study and those of other young vlm objects suggest that the binary fraction of vlm objects is higher in star - forming regions like taurus and upper scorpius than in the field .",
    "additionally , four of our five binaries have separations beyond 20 au , a configuration previously found to be rare for vlm binaries .",
    "these wide binaries , coupled with the statistically significant truncation of field vlm binaries beyond 20 au , suggest that dynamical evolution produces the observed field vlm binary properties . along these lines , we find that it is difficult to produce these results using the ejection scenario of vlm object formation , as wide binaries are not expected to survive this process .",
    "dynamical perturbations may play a roll in determining the final distribution of vlm binary systems , as their small mass relative to the average mass of a perturbing object cam cause them to be more readily hardened over time than stellar mass binaries .",
    "more simulations that take into the effects of the mass of a vlm binary with respect to the rest of either the cluster or the field population are needed to determine if such dynamics are sufficient to explain the binding energy discrepancy .",

    "<S> we surveyed thirteen very low mass ( vlm ; m @xmath00.2 m@xmath1 ) objects in the taurus star - forming region using near - infrared diffraction - limited imaging techniques on the w.m . </S>",
    "<S> keck i 10 m telescope . of these thirteen , </S>",
    "<S> five were found to be binary , with separations ranging from 0@xmath204 to 0@xmath26 and flux ratios from 1.4 to 3.7 . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the companions are likely to be physically associated with the primaries ( probability @xmath34@xmath4 ) . using the theoretical models of baraffe et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) , we find that all five new companions , as well as one of the primaries , are likely brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of these systems therefore increases the total number of known , young vlm binaries by @xmath550@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these new systems , along with other young vlm binaries from the literature , have properties that differ significantly from older field vlm binaries in that the young systems have wider separations and lower mass ratios , supporting the idea that vlm binaries undergo significant dynamical evolution @xmath55 - 10 myr after their formation . </S>",
    "<S> the range of separations of these binaries , four of which are over 30 au , argues against the ejection scenario of brown dwarf formation . while several of the young , vlm binaries discovered in this study have lower binding energies than the previously suggested minimum for vlm binaries , the apparent minimum is still significantly higher than that found among higher mass binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this discrepancy may be due to the small mass of a vlm binary relative to the average perturbing star , leading to more substantial changes in their binding energy over time . </S>"
