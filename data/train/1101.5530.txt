    "studied , the growth , or depinning , of an interface is described relative to a ( usually one - dimensional ) substrate .",
    "temporal and spatial correlations in the interface are examined and dynamical universality classes are identified . in many cases ,",
    "the nonequilibrium character of the phenomenon can be related to the breaking of detailed balance of configurational moves . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with one of the simplest ways in which detailed balance can be broken , leading to an intrinsically nonequilibrium system . in particular , after a move in configuration space the system can get trapped in certain configurations when the probability for the reversed move is identically zero . in thermal equilibrium , at finite temperature @xmath1 , the reversed move always has a nonzero probability , proportional to the boltzmann factor , which features the ( finite ) energy difference of the initial and final configurations . however , if we leave thermal equilibrium , by imposing constraints on the local absorption or emission of energy , detailed balance may be broken .",
    "we can go one step further along this line and leave the thermal context altogether by considering a classical system , say , at zero temperature , and providing a nonthermal mechanism for local energy exchange .    to concretize our proposal , consider a ( quasi-)two - dimensional lattice spin system at @xmath2 which is exposed to a photon bombardment from some external source .",
    "the photon energies @xmath3 are limited by a cutoff @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that a spin hit by a photon may absorb an energy @xmath5 , so that in all cases @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , a spin may ( always ) relax by emitting a photon of arbitrary energy and we assume that photon leaves the plane so that the probability for absorption of emitted photons is negligible . the origin of the energy cutoff in this model is quantum mechanical . although it is not necessary to invoke quantum mechanics explicitly to provide nonthermal energy fluctuations ( random - field or random - bond disorder , electromagnetic fields , mechanical or chemical oscillators being alternative sources ) , it is a convenient frame - work for obtaining a sharp energy cutoff . in this manner",
    "we arrive at a model in which excitations of energy superior to @xmath0 are excluded , which implies that certain configurations can be trapping or  absorbing \" .    in the following",
    "we develop this model further and investigate how the character of a wetting transition is modified when thermal fluctuations are replaced by constrained nonthermal ones .",
    "we do so using monte carlo simulation and start within the context of the exactly solved wetting transition of a system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we test our simulation approach on the critical wetting transition in the two - dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "section iii is devoted to the definition of the nonthermal model , the analysis of the bulk phases and the observation and characterization of nonequilibrium wetting transitions of various nature .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "consider the two - dimensional square lattice ising model with ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath7 , at a temperature @xmath1 below the bulk critical temperature @xmath8 and in zero bulk magnetic field .",
    "in this situation the bulk consists of large coexisting regions of positive and negative magnetization . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the behavior of the bulk is independent of the boundary conditions , but this is not the case for the interface between the coexisting phases . in the case of a wetting transition , the surface excess free energy depends in a singular way on a surface field . to get efficient computational access to this transition",
    ", we use the same setup as in @xcite : a two - dimensional @xmath9 square lattice of spins , _ periodic boundary conditions _ along the @xmath10-axis , _ open boundary conditions _ along the @xmath11-axis , and an _ anti - symmetric surface magnetic field _ @xmath12 acting on the spins along the open boundaries ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this set - up is often referred to as one with  opposing boundaries \" or  competing walls \" and possesses surprisingly subtle and rich surface _ and _ bulk cooperative behavior @xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit , letting @xmath13 followed by @xmath14 , a sharp surface phase transition occurs as a function of the control parameter @xmath15 , assuming fixed @xmath16 . for small and opposing surface fields @xmath15 and -@xmath17 , with @xmath17 below the wetting point @xmath18 , the interface is localized at one of the boundaries and this two - fold degenerate state is called partial wetting : figure [ fig1 ] b ) .",

    ", however , it suffices to verify the order of the transition and to obtain an estimate of its location in parameter space .",
    "therefore , a simpler approach is adopted .",
    "first , a bulk - like order parameter , the  magnetization amplitude \" @xmath22 is introduced @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spin observable ( @xmath25 ) at site ( @xmath26 ) . for a system in the partial wetting state with an interface close to the boundary",
    ", @xmath22 will be close to its maximum value of @xmath27 , while for complete wetting with an interface near the middle of the strip , @xmath22 will be ( much ) smaller .",
    "next , as a crude approximation to the successive limits @xmath13 and @xmath28 the fixed values @xmath29 and @xmath30 are used , and simulations are executed for fixed temperature @xmath1 and different values of @xmath15 . during each run a time averaged probability density @xmath31 of the order parameter",
    "is approximated by a normalized histogram .",
    "[ h ]    ising.eps    in figure [ fig2 ] the resulting histograms are shown for @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath15 significantly smaller than @xmath33 the distributions are centered around a value close to unity , while for substantially larger surface fields , it is very unlikely to measure a @xmath22 close to 1 . around",
    "@xmath34 one observes a transition region where the distributions are broad , indicating the presence of large fluctuations consistently with a second - order interfacial phase transition .",
    "if we identify the wetting transition in the ising model heuristically with the point where the distribution of @xmath22 has a maximal variance , the result is in quite satisfactory agreement with the exact location .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath35 the wetting transition , at @xmath36 , is , exceptionally , of _ first order _ and purely determined by minimum energy considerations .",
    "[ ptbh ]    isingdata.eps    in figure [ fig3 ] our estimates for the transition point for several temperatures are compared with the exact result of abraham for the critical wetting phase boundary @xcite , @xmath37 for temperatures not too close to @xmath8 we are able to determine the wetting transition fairly accurately .",
    "closer to the critical temperature the interface is more fuzzy and it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between partial and complete wetting in a small system as we used .",
    "the method appears to be useful in principle for locating the wetting transition qualitatively .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that the shape of the histogram provides an indication of the _ order _ of the transition .",
    "if , like in the thermal ising case , one only observes distributions with one maximum and notices an increase of the variance in between the two sets of sharper shapes corresponding to the partial wetting ( @xmath38 ) or complete wetting ( @xmath39 ) states , one is in all likelihood dealing with a second - order phase transition .",
    "close to a first - order transition , on the other hand , one rather expects distributions with two maxima that exchange dominance on crossing the transition point @xcite .",
    "further , the valley between the maxima is an expression of the hysteresis effect , the strength of which is proportional to the peak - to - valley ratio .",
    "hysteresis is a clear signature of a first - order phenomenon .",
    "we will make use of these criteria in the analysis of the nonequilibrium model that we now introduce .",
    "in our preliminary simulation study of the ( thermal ) ising model in the previous section the statistics was defined through a dynamics described by a continuous - time markov process .",
    "in such an approach one aims to replace the canonical - ensemble average of the system by the time average in the long - time limit .",
    "usually a dynamics is chosen that locally changes spin configurations @xmath40 with rates that obey detailed balance with respect to the gibbs measure defined by the energy functional @xmath41 . a physically appealing choice for realizing this is the single - spin flip glauber dynamics @xcite .",
    "one chooses at random a spin and calculates the energy difference @xmath42 of the system upon flipping the spin .",
    "next , time is increased by one unit ( usually 1/volume ) and the spin under consideration is flipped with probability @xmath43 :    @xmath44 , \\label{flip glauber}\\\\% { \\parbox[b]{\\textwidth}{\\begin{center } \\includegraphics [ height=1.2177 in , width=2.8885 in ] % { tanh.eps}% \\end{center } \\caption{traditional glauber spin - flip probability as a function of the reduced local energy difference of final and initial states , for the ising model in thermal equilibrium .",

    "on repeating these spin - flip trials , starting from any initial configuration , in the long - time limit the system will visit all configurations with the correct gibbs probability , i.e. , the stationary state ( probability distribution ) of the markov process equals the gibbs measure .",
    "we now introduce a different spin - flip dynamics for which the stationary state can not be described by a gibbs measure for any energy functional .",
    "in such a system the dynamics is not induced by thermal effects and it is therefore an intrinsically nonequilibrium system .",
    "it is well known that nonequilibrium phase transitions can occur @xcite , i.e. , expectation values of observables in the stationary state can depend in a singular way on control parameters .",
    "our study focuses on a nonequilibrium transition of wetting type .    from the probability function ( [ flip glauber ] )",
    "it is clear that even if the energy cost for a spin flip is large , the flip probability remains strictly positive .",
    "this is an essential property of equilibrium models ( not only of the glauber dynamics ) and it is related to the ergodicity of the dynamics . therefore , a model without this property can be expected to have qualitatively different behavior .",
    "this leads us to the following definition of a nonequilibrium model .",
    "consider the two - dimensional ising model with nearest - neighbor interaction energy @xmath47 on the square lattice .",
    "we use the same setup as in figure [ fig1 ] , but allow nearest - neighbor spins on the boundaries @xmath48 or @xmath49 to have a different nearest - neighbor interaction energy , @xmath50 .",
    "the energy functional of this system can be written as@xmath51 where @xmath47 and @xmath50 are the nearest - neighbor bulk and surface interaction energies , respectively , and @xmath52 is the ( anti - symmetric ) surface field .",
    "the two boundaries are denoted by @xmath53 and located at @xmath54 and @xmath55 . on this model",
    "we define the dynamics , which is not induced by thermal effects but by local absorption or emission of energy quanta . as in the glauber model , we allow only a single spin flip at a given time . this flip can be the result of a photon - spin collision ( absorption ) or a spontaneous photon emission .",
    "we assume that the absorption probability decreases with energy , mimicking a certain photon frequency distribution , and becomes zero at a finite energy cutoff @xmath0 , which is the maximum photon energy .",
    "we further assume that relaxation of a spin towards a lower local energy yields a photon that is emitted out of the lattice plane , so that we ignore spatial correlations between spin flips and avoid possible ( secondary ) absorption of energies greater than the cutoff .",

    "this has major implications for the possible transitions between configurations .",
    "it can cause the system to be nonergodic and , as we will show , absorbing states can occur .",
    "qualitatively , one can ask whether the energy @xmath0 plays a role similar to that of the energy @xmath59 in the thermal model , by examining the spin - flip functions and their slopes at @xmath60 . on the one hand it seems irrelevant whether we call the energy scale , relative to which we measure the interactions , @xmath61 or @xmath0 .",
    "when both are large compared to the interaction and field energies the spin - flip function is sampled only over a small domain near the origin , where its value is about 1/2 . in this regime our model can not behave differently from the high - temperature limit of the ising model . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath62 and @xmath0 are both small compared to @xmath47 , @xmath50 and @xmath17 , however , the two models are physically different . in this limit",
    "excitations are excluded in the nonthermal model , while they are not in the low - temperature regime of the ising model , although their probability is small .",
    "( the extreme case @xmath2 displays some special effects , which will be discussed separately further on . ) while minimal energy considerations suffice , in the thermal model , to discuss phase transitions at low @xmath1 , there is no such thing as an energy minimization principle in the nonthermal model for small @xmath0 , because the dynamics takes the system to one out of several absorbing states , regardless of their energy and only depending on which one is encountered first .",
    "even greater physical differences between the two models arise when stable ( i.e. ,  attracting \" ) non - absorbing states and absorbing states are _ cohabitant _ ( rather than  coexistent \" , a term which has a well - defined meaning in the context of equilibrium phases ) , as for example in the contact process at sufficiently large infection rate @xcite .",
    "this regime is found at intermediate values of @xmath0 , for which ratios like @xmath63 are of order unity . under these circumstances",
    "there is little or no connection between the behavior of the thermal and nonthermal models , in addition to the fact that free energy considerations do not apply to the latter .",
    "it is in this regime that our search will be conducted .",
    "before we turn to a first analysis of the model , it is convenient to define dimensionless variables for the couplings and the reduced surface field : @xmath64      since we are interested in wetting transitions , in which an interface can form and move , the bulk of the system needs to be in the ( two - fold degenerate ) ordered phase .",
    "therefore we start by analyzing the bulk behavior of an infinitely large system , defined by the coupling parameter @xmath65 .",
    "it is instructive to recall that the equilibrium critical point of the thermal ising model is located at @xmath66 ( square lattice ) .",
    "we have implicitly reproduced this in our simulations of the critical wetting phase boundary ( fig.3 ) , which terminates at @xmath67 . in the disordered phase limit , @xmath68 or @xmath69 , the correspondence @xmath70 holds , as we discussed . in the spirit of a ",
    "low-@xmath71 \" approximation , that is , assuming that the physics found in the high cutoff energy limit can be extrapolated , one would thus expect a dynamical critical point at @xmath72 for the nonthermal model .",
    "however , the appearance of absorbing ordered states above a certain value of @xmath71 may drastically alter this guess , especially if absorbing states occur already for @xmath73 . in this case , ordered bulk phases are being favored by the dynamics and we may expect the dynamical @xmath74 to decrease .    to examine this , in the presence of the cutoff energy @xmath75",
    ", it is useful to identify first the type of spin with the highest excitation energy cost @xmath42 for flipping : a spin aligned with all its neighbors . if this cost , @xmath76 , exceeds @xmath75 the spin flip is prohibited .",
    "consequently , if @xmath77 the system has two absorbing states in which the dynamics is frozen , @xmath78 and @xmath79 : a configuration with all spins up or all spins down . for @xmath80 there are no absorbing states and we find ourselves in a situation akin to that of the thermal ising model .",
    "therefore , nonequilibrium effects may be expected to drive the dynamical @xmath74 downwards towards the value 0.125 , but not lower .",
    "the next important threshold for @xmath71 is the value above which a spin can also not flip if it is aligned with _ all but one _ of its neighbors : @xmath81 . above this coupling strength",
    "infinitely many ( @xmath82 for a finite system ) configurations become absorbing ; any configuration with one horizontal interface separating a spin up from a spin down region is frozen .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of that of the zero - temperature ising model , for which the complete wetting state is ( @xmath82)-fold degenerate and the interface  does not move \" . note that for @xmath83 an interface between up and down domains is not frozen .",
    "consequently , in order to allow interesting interface dynamics _ and _ the presence of absorbing states , we turn our attention to the regime @xmath84 . in this intermediate - coupling regime",
    "the behavior of our model is likely to be qualitatively different from _ both _ the finite - temperature and the zero - temperature ising model .",
    "now , for consistency , we need to verify that the dynamical critical value @xmath74 above which the system is in an ordered phase is low enough for the regime of bulk order to overlap substantially with the interval @xmath84 .",
    "since for @xmath85 the ordered states @xmath86 and @xmath79 are absorbing , it seems that @xmath87 is a plausible lower bound . in the absence of ergodicity it is not a priori clear that a random initial state at @xmath88 will evolve into one of the two absorbing states .",
    "it is possible that a third , disordered , stationary state exists which is a dynamical attractor and features an order parameter probability distribution in which the probability to find the system in an absorbing state is zero .    to decide on order versus disorder in bulk",
    ", we performed a first simulation of the nonthermal model , with uniform couplings @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    ", @xmath93 is zero in the ordered phase and strictly positive in the disordered one .",
    "the scaled variance of this observable , i.e. , multiplied by the number of spins @xmath96 , is akin to a dynamical version of the specific heat ( capacity ) per spin . if the bulk transition is of second order , we expect this dynamical specific heat to diverge approaching the bulk dynamical critical point .",
    "for finite systems we expect a peak , which becomes more pronounced and moves closer to the correct critical point with increasing system size .",
    "[ h ]    bulk.eps    in figure [ fig4 ] the result of the simulation for three system sizes is shown .",
    "besides the weak singularities in @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which reflect effects of the sharp energy cutoff @xmath0 , one clearly observes the building up of a divergence , suggesting a second - order transition with @xmath99 . to verify this and to get a precise estimate of the dynamical critical value @xmath74 , larger system sizes and an extrapolation",
    "are needed .",
    "both ambitions are outside the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , from the previous considerations and these data we can convincingly infer that the @xmath71-window suitable for our explorations is:@xmath100 in the remainder of the paper we fix the bulk coupling therefore to a typical value in this range , @xmath101 , and we now embark on the investigation of possible wetting phenomena . note that the spin - flip possibilities for spins on the two boundaries depend on the strengths of surface coupling and reduced surface field , and will be essential ingredients in our study .",
    "we return to the strip geometry ( fig.1 ) . in order to understand the effect of the surface interaction energy @xmath102 and surface field @xmath12 it is , again , instructive to start with considerations involving the cutoff energy @xmath0 .",
    "the energy cost for a surface spin , aligned with all its three neighbors , to flip is @xmath103 or @xmath104 , depending on the spin orientation with respect to the surface field .",
    "if both exceed @xmath75 , the spins on both boundaries can not destroy the absorbing character of the bulk and the two states @xmath105 and @xmath79 remain absorbing .",

    "wetting becomes absorbing if the ( reduced ) surface field becomes small relative to the surface coupling .",

    "the converse can also take place .",
    "consider a spin state in which all the spins on the boundaries are aligned and parallel to the local surface field .",
    "this includes , e.g. , the state sketched in figure [ fig1]a ) corresponding to a complete wetting configuration .",
    "we simply refer to all these states as ",
    "complete wetting \" , regardless of whether the interface is in the middle of the strip or close to a boundary .",
    "the important point is that the interface is separated from each boundary by at least one row of spins ( cf . the multiply degenerate complete wetting state of the @xmath2 ising model ) .",
    "now , when the reduced surface field @xmath107 and/or surface coupling @xmath108 becomes large enough relative to the bulk coupling @xmath71 , the boundary spins are unable to flip even when the bulk is in the opposite spin state and the interface can never quite touch the border , but it can still can wander between the boundaries ( since @xmath83 ) .",

    "finally we remark that the separatrices in the phase diagram of figure [ fig5 ] between phases @xmath38 and @xmath129 , or between phases @xmath39 and @xmath130 , are due to the singular behavior of the spin flip probabilities ( [ flip non - equil ] ) about the value @xmath131 and are irrelevant to the wetting phenomena . for instance , the transition from @xmath38 to @xmath115 is a one - dimensional surface transition ( which is not a sharp phase transition ) .    in closing this section",
    "we also show , for completeness and for comparison , the phase diagram of the first - order wetting phase transition in the zero - temperature ising model , in figure 11 .",
    "the equilibrium transition at @xmath36 is shown , together with the spinodal lines at @xmath132 .",
    "with respect to the glauber dynamics all states with an interface parallel to the boundaries and the fully ordered states are absorbing states in the region @xmath133 in between the spinodals . beyond these spinodals , only _ either _ the fully ordered states @xmath86 and @xmath79 ( @xmath115 ) _ or _ the interface states are absorbing ( @xmath134 ) .",

    "in this paper we studied the wetting transition from partial wetting to complete wetting in a nonthermal two - dimensional ferromagnetic ising - like lattice model defined by a stochastic dynamics .",
    "the geometry is a periodic rectangular strip with opposing walls .",
    "we used a simple monte carlo simulation technique which could reproduce the order of the wetting transition and approximate the known phase diagram for the case of critical wetting in the equilibrium 2d ising model with nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath135 and reduced surface fields @xmath136 . for this equilibrium test case we employed a single spin - flip dynamics which obeys detailed balance with respect to the gibbs measure for the given energy functional .",
    "next we introduced an energy functional with , in addition to @xmath47 and @xmath17 , a tunable surface spin interaction energy @xmath50 ( between nearest neighbors ) and introduced a non - equilibrium dynamics based on a piece - wise linear single spin - flip probability function which features an energy cutoff for excitations , @xmath0 , beyond which no spin flips can occur .",
    "spin flips concur with photon absorption or emission , and @xmath62 is negligible compared to all other interaction and field energies involved .    analyzing the wetting transition using the monte carlo simulation technique",
    ", we found a rich phase diagram in the space @xmath137 , for fixed nearest - neighbor coupling strength in the intermediate regime @xmath138 . in this range of @xmath71",
    "the interface between oppositely magnetized domains can still wander freely , but single spin excitations in a uniform domain are suppressed by the cutoff .",
    "absorbing states can occur , and partial wetting as well as complete wetting can be absorbing .",
    "a second - order wetting transition is found for weak surface coupling , when absorbing states are absent .",
    "this transition changes to a dynamical first - order phenomenon , with hysteresis , for strong surface coupling . in a special region of the phase diagram ,",
    "a dynamical attractor corresponding to complete wetting is _ cohabitant _ with an absorbing partial wetting state .",
    "the first - order phenomenon is qualitatively new and its properties are largely due to the presence of the energy cutoff for excitations .",
    "only some of its characteristics can be understood as remnants of the trivial first - order wetting transition in the zero - temperature ising model .",
