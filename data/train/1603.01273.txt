    "for the present paper , we begin to develop our techniques in the simplest possible context .",
    "we begin with a pure scalar field theory in 2 dimensions ( 1 spatial dimension ) with a quartic coupling and a parity symmetry .",
    "our lagrangian is @xmath1 because of the parity symmetry , even and odd numbers of asymptotically - free particles decouple and we focus on basis states with an even number of free particles in the present work .",
    "the action resulting from our lagrangian is @xmath2 since the action is dimensionless , @xmath3 has dimension @xmath4 and @xmath5 has dimension @xmath6 , we find that @xmath7 is dimensionless .",
    "this implies that @xmath8 has dimension @xmath9 .    before continuing the technical details",
    ", we note that @xcite studied various theoretical properties of this 2-dimensional theory .",
    "we also note that the numerical diagonalization of scalar @xmath10 theory has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "however , our work is novel in several respects . among them",
    "are that @xcite focused solely on the properties of the vacuum whereas we consider it as just one ( important ) state among the many other eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "also , our hamiltonian is lorentz covariant , our approach to renormalization is different , and @xcite were not interested in the s - matrix .    in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian , we need a complete basis set for which we can calculate the hamiltonian .",
    "we use direct products of free particles for our basis .",
    "we label them as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the momenta and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the multiplicities for those momenta . as previously described , because our theory has a parity symmetry , even and odd numbers of free particles will decouple . for computational efficiency , therefore , we diagonalize the hamiltonian separately for basis state with even and odd numbers of particles .",
    "however , we will consider both even and odd numbers of free particles together in the present discussion for convenience .",
    "the free energies for our basis states are defined by @xmath16 , which is simply the sum of the free energies for each free particle in the basis state .",
    "we next define a creation operator to have the property that it adds a free - particle to the direct product of free - particle states already present @xmath17 some details of the creation operator can be found in appendix  [ app : a and adagger ] where we also show that this results in the hermitian conjugate annihilating a free particle as in @xmath18 consequently , these operators satisfy the commutation property @xmath19 = 2\\pi\\delta(p - p')\\ .\\ ] ] with these operators , a field theory can be constructed in the usual way ( see weinberg @xcite ) by writing the scalar field as a linear combination of these two operators @xmath20\\ .",

    ", we switch to discrete momentum space .",

    "we can see that the effectively free part of this hamiltonian ( the part that is quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators ) not only contains the free - particle energy @xmath29 but also the second term proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "this comes from the normal ordering removing creation and annihilation operators from the original hamiltonian .",
    "( [ eq : discrete hamiltonian ] ) is the hamiltonian that we will diagonalize in this work .",
    "since our hamiltonian conserves momentum ( as it must ) , we need only consider states with total momentum equal to zero .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix elements for any other center of momentum can be obtained from these by an appropriate lorentz transformation .    in order to diagonalize this hamiltonian",
    ", we find its matrix elements in the free - particle product basis by sandwiching this operator between the basis states .",
    "for example , the free - vacuum matrix element is given by @xmath30 since every operator of the hamiltonian annihilates either the free vacuum on the right or the left .",
    "other elements are , of course , non zero .",
    "as we mentioned , the basis states with an odd number of free particles decouple .",
    "we can now see that this is because every term of the hamiltonian contains an even number of creation and annihilation operators . since we only consider basis states with zero total momentum ,",
    "there is only one basis state with one free particle to consider .",
    "it is @xmath31gev@xmath32 and the only nonzero hamiltonian matrix element involving it is the diagonal term @xmath33 the matrix element between the free vacuum @xmath34 and @xmath31gev@xmath35 is @xmath36 while @xmath37 is its hermitian conjugate .",
    "the matrix element between the free vacuum @xmath34 and one of the basis states with a product of two distinct free particles @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and its hermitian conjugate is the complex conjugate .",
    "this accounts for the top row and first column of the matrix .",
    "the third row contains @xmath41gev@xmath42 on the left .",
    "the diagonal entry of this row is given by @xmath43 slightly greater than double eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 part energy ] ) , while the other entries are @xmath44    the interior of the matrix is given by both the bra and ket containing a product of two distinct free particles .",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46    other hamiltonian matrix elements are similarly obtained with greater numbers of free particles in the basis states .",
    "we implemented the hamiltonian described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : discrete hamiltonian ] ) and diagonalized it using the numerical techniques described in app .",
    "[ app : numerical techniques ] . for this section",
    ", we chose our illustrative constants to be @xmath47 and cut off our single particle momenta at @xmath48gev . by design",
    ", we took @xmath49 to be small compared to @xmath50 and @xmath8 while the cutoff momentum was taken to be large compared to the same .",
    "we also took @xmath8 to be small compared to @xmath50 .",
    "altogether , we took @xmath51 .",
    "the absolute scale of energy is arbitrary ; we have chosen gev .    in order to build up our understanding of this field - theory - hamiltonian diagonalization technique and its consequences , in the present work",
    ", we have restricted our basis states to only include two or fewer free particles .",
    "this will allow us to develop our results in as simple a system as possible and enable us to draw conclusions about the results more easily . however , our intention in future works is to go beyond this limitation and consider more complex systems with more complete hilbert spaces .",
    "therefore , in this work , our basis states consist of the free vacuum @xmath34 , the one - free - particle state @xmath31gev@xmath32 , and two - free - particle states with each particle s momentum below @xmath48gev as described above .",

    "we have found that with the parameters listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parameters ] ) , the lowest energy eigenvalue ( associated with the vacuum ) has a value of -0.0517gev , the single - particle state ( associated with @xmath31gev@xmath32 ) has an energy of 1.075gev , and the lowest - energy two - particle eigenstate ( associated most closely with @xmath31gev@xmath35 ) has an energy of 2.151gev , double that of the single - particle state .",
    "this is because the lowest - energy two - particle state is dominated by two free particles at rest and the diagonal entry for two particles at rest in eq .",
    "( [ eq:<0,2|h|0,2 > ] ) is essentially double that of the diagonal entry of a single particle at rest in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 part energy ] ) .",
    "the energies of the other two - particle states grow nearly linearly from there .",
    "we note that the eigenvalue energies lie very close to the free energies of their dominant basis state .",
    "however , they are not exactly equal . to further clarify the relationship with the free energies of the basis states",
    ", we have plotted the difference between the eigenvalues and the basis - state energies in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : enspectrum2 ] .",
    "we see that the vacuum is slightly below the free energy of the free vacuum @xmath34 as mentioned previously .",
    "the fact that its energy is very close to @xmath63 is a coincidence as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : delta p ] .",
    "the single - particle state energy is slightly above the free energy of a single particle , the lowest two - particle eigenstate doubles the difference with the free energy of @xmath31gev@xmath35 , and the higher energy two - particle states have energies that asymptotically approach the free energies of their associated basis states .",
    "the reason the energies are greater than the free energies of the associated basis states is due to the interactions and the nonperturbative nature of our calculation as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 part energy ] ) for the single - particle state . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:<0,2|h|0,2 > ] ) , on the other hand , we see that the first two terms are exactly double those in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 part energy ] ) , leading to the very - nearly double eigenvalue .",
    "we also note that there is a gap between the vacuum and the one - particle eigenstate and then another between the one - particle state and the continuum of two - particle states .",
    "as expected , this is due to the mass of the particle . in fact",
    ", the mass gap is the difference between the single - particle state energy and that of the vacuum .",
    "therefore , we take the physical value of the mass in this calculation to be 1.075gev+0.052gev=1.127gev . and , similarly for the other eigenstates .",
    "the physical energy is the difference between the energy eigenvalue and the vacuum energy .",
    "so , the physical energy of the first two - particle state is 2.151gev+0.052gev=2.203gev , a little less than double the physical energy of the single - particle state .",
    "this may be a sign of binding energy .",
    "further investigation is required .    additionally , we have diagonalized the hamiltonian for hundreds of unique nonzero times and find that the eigenvalues exactly agree for all time .",
    "we find , therefore , that the energy eigenvalues are independent of time , as we would expect from energy conservation .",

    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacuumwavefunction2 ] where the wavefunction for two different times were plotted and are exactly on top of each other .",
    "in fact , we numerically diagonalized the hamiltonian for a few hundred different times and found exact agreement of the modulus of the coefficients for all time .",
    "this is expected since the hamiltonian is the generator of time evolution .",
    "since these solutions are eigenstates of the hamiltonian , we expect that , at most , their phases change as a function of time .",
    "we will discuss the phases in subsection  [ sec : results : wave function phases ] .",
    "there are several general features of these wavefunctions .",
    "we see that there is no contribution from the free single - particle basis state @xmath31gev@xmath32 .",
    "this is because the basis states with odd numbers of free particles decouple from those with even numbers of free particles .",
    "we also see that there is a gap between the contribution of the free vacuum and the free two - particle states .",
    "this is because we have plotted these eigenstates as functions of the free - particle energies of the basis states and there is a gap in the free - particle energies between the zero - particle and two - particle basis states .",
    "however , even if we plotted the eigenstate as a function of the ordinal number of the basis state given in the left column of table  [ tab : basis states ] ( but leaving out the single - particle state ) , there would be no gap and the line would be continuous , but there would be a kink in the wavefunction at the free - particle vacuum .",
    "this is because the free vacuum is fundamentally different than the continuum of two - particle basis states .",
    "so , in general , we do not expect its contribution to any particle eigenstate to be infinitesimally close to the two - particle basis states adjacent to it .    in general",
    ", we also find that there is a kink between the contribution from the basis - state @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are the first two basis states in the continuum . presumably , this is because the basis state @xmath67 is a direct product of two particles at rest , whereas the other two - particle basis states have particles with equal but opposite non - zero momenta .",
    "we also see that , for each eigenstate , there is one basis state that dominates the wavefunction while all other basis states contribute at approximately the percent or less level .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the coupling .",
    "if we turned the coupling off completely , the theory would be absolutely free and the eigenstates would be delta functions centered at each of the free - particle basis states .",
    "when we turn the coupling on to a very small value , the states adjacent to this basis state suddenly turn on their contribution , continuously with the coupling .",
    "because of this , the contribution of the adjacent basis states is small in proportion to the smallness of the coupling constant .",
    "we , furthermore , see that this creates a kink in the eigenstate at the basis states directly to the sides of the former delta function .",
    "this is because as we turn the coupling on from zero , the contribution from these states immediately turns on , but continuously in the continuum of states to the sides of the former delta function .",
    "that is , they all come up together , forming a kink .",
    "this kink tends to be mild , however .    the top plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacuumwavefunction2 ] gives the wavefunction of the vacuum , the eigenstate of lowest energy .",
    "as expected , we can see that it is strongly peaked at the free vacuum @xmath34 .",
    "its coefficient is 0.991 .",
    "the next most important contribution to the vacuum is from the basis state @xmath68 , containing two free particles , each with @xmath69gev of momentum .",
    "its contribution to the vacuum is a few percent . beyond this",
    ", the contribution falls off towards zero .",
    "we note that although the fall off appears to be gradual , this is on a log plot . by the time the two - hundred - third basis state is reached , the contribution to the wavefunction has fallen to a few hundredths of a percent .    the middle plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacuumwavefunction2 ] gives the wavefunction of the first two - particle state , the state whose energy is directly above that of the vacuum and single - particle state , and which has slightly more energy than the free - particle energy of its dominant basis state .",
    "we can see that it is strongly peaked at the lowest free - particle basis state with two particles , namely @xmath67 , where each free particle is at rest .",
    "its coefficient is 0.937 .",
    "the next most important contribution to this eigenstate is from the basis state @xmath68 which contributes at the few percent level . beyond this",
    ", the contribution to this eigenstate falls off towards zero .    the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacuumwavefunction2 ] gives the wavefunction of the fiftieth two - particle state , the state with the fiftieth energy level above that of the vacuum and single - particle state .",
    "we see that it is strongly peaked at the fiftieth free - particle product state with two particles , namely @xmath70 , whose free - particle energy is @xmath71gev .",
    "its coefficient is 0.99996 .",
    "all other basis states contribute at the less than one percent level .",
    "the highest of these is the free vacuum at the half percent level .",
    "this drops to a hundredth of a percent for @xmath67 , followed by a small discrete jump and then a gradual increase towards the peak reaching a pre - peak maximum of a few tenths of a percent . at this point , and on the other side of the peak , is a mild kink due to the nonzero coupling bringing up the contribution of the adjacent states together . as in the previous two cases , we see that the contribution to this eigenstate continues to fall off at higher basis states , eventually tending towards zero",
    ".    we also note that due to the decoupling nature of the basis states with an odd number of free particles and the fact that we only included basis states with two or fewer free particles , the single particle state @xmath31gev@xmath32 is the only basis state to be diagonal in its block of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , it is already diagonalized and its wavefunction is a delta function at this basis state .",
    "now that we have an understanding of the absolute values of the coefficients of the wavefunctions , we turn our attention to the phases of these same coefficients . since the overall phase of any eigenstate is arbitrary , we have normalized it by taking the phase of the coefficient of the free - vacuum basis state @xmath34 to be @xmath72 .",

    "that is , the difference between the wavefunctions for cutoffs of 75gev and 85gev is much smaller than the difference between the wavefunctions for cutoffs of 5gev and 15gev .",
    "the reason for this is that as the wavefunction extends to higher basis states , the contribution to the normalization from these states suddenly turns on . since the higher basis states are contributing , the lower basis states must adjust to keep the normalization fixed . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher basis states contribute a very small , exponentially decreasing , amount to the lower eigenstate wavefunctions , so the importance of this diminishes as the cutoff momentum grows .",

    "for the remainder of this section , we will discuss a few of our future plans .",
    "now that we have warmed up with our @xmath0 theory in two space - time dimensions with a hilbert space that included only up to two free particles in the basis states , there are two important immediate projects to complete .",
    "one is to increase the hilbert space to include up to four free particles in the basis states .",
    "this will already involve a planned improvement in the efficiency of our diagonalization code . with this enlarged hilbert space",
    ", we will see how greatly truncating the number of free particles in the basis states has effected our results .",
    "we will also have the possibility of non - trivial s - matrix elements for the first time since the eigenstates will no longer all be nondegenerate . once we have non - trivial s - matrix elements , we will also be able to analyze the dependence of scattering amplitudes on the collision energy .    in another related direction",
    ", we would like to diagonalize the hamiltonian of @xmath0 theory in three space - time dimensions and better determine the benefits and drawbacks of only including two space - time dimensions .",
    "furthermore , although we will only include up to two - particle basis states in the hilbert space , because the particles can have momentum in two dimensions , degeneracies will be possible and non - trivial scattering will be allowed .    finally ,",
    "as we increase our understanding of @xmath0 theory in the context of this new technique , we would like to extend the methods described here to other particles and interactions of the sm , including qed , qcd and beyond .",
    "the author would like to thank r.  grobe , q.  su and q.z .",
    "lv for bringing the diagonalization of the hamiltonian to the author s knowledge and for helpful comments in the early stages of this project .",
    "in this appendix , we will briefly review the derivation of the properties of the creation and annihilation operators . as described in section  [ sec : theory ] , we define our hilbert - space basis as the direct product of single - particle states and label these states as @xmath166 where @xmath167 represents the one - dimensional momentum and @xmath168 represents the multiplicity for that momentum .",
    "this momentum multiplicity notation is not really ideal for continuous momenta .",
    "in contrast , it is very convenient for discrete momenta , which is the main subect of this paper",
    ". therefore , in this appendix , we will derive the properties of the creation and annihilation operators in discrete momentum space . since the single - particle states are orthogonal ( and by construction they are normalized ) , we have the inner product rule @xmath169 where the product is over all pairs of momenta and the sum is over all orderings of the products . any inner products",
    "where momenta with nonzero multiplicities do not match up are , of course , zero .",
    "for example , @xmath170    with this set of basis states and inner - product rules , we now _ define _ the creation operator to have the property that it adds one particle to the basis state @xmath171 other normalizations would not give the correct physical values for the masses . as a _ consequence _ of this definition , we get that the hermitian conjugate of the creation operator annihilates a particle from the basis state .",
    "we can see this by inserting the hermitian conjugate of the creation operator between two general basis states as in @xmath172 where we have separated the @xmath173 term from the rest of the product .",
    "this last line is equal to @xmath174 ( since @xmath175 ) . as a result ,",
    "we obtain from this the rule @xmath176 which is exactly the definition of the annihilation operator .",
    "now that we have the creation and annihilation operators , we can also determine their commutator by acting on a given basis state in both orders @xmath177 and then taking the difference @xmath178 which gives us @xmath179 = 1\\ .\\ ] ] on the other hand , if the momenta are not the same , we have @xmath180 and then taking the difference @xmath181 where @xmath182 . putting these together ,",
    "we find @xmath183 = \\delta_{p',p}\\ .\\ ] ]",
    "in order to evaluate the complex hermitian hamiltonian matrix numerically and diagonalize it , we wrote a c++ code .",
    "we implemented a complex number , a matrix based on that number and a diagonalization routine that works in two steps .",
    "the first step uses the householder method to tridiagonalize the matrix .",
    "this is followed by a series of jacobi transformations that drive the final off - diagonal elements to zero .",
    "once this was done , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : discrete hamiltonian ] ) was implemented and diagonalized .",
    "we will very briefly describe the diagonalization steps below .",
    "as we mentioned , the first step of the diagonalization uses the householder method to transform the matrix to tridiagonal form where all entries are zero except the diagonal and the elements directly above and below the diagonal .",
    "this step occurs as a series of @xmath184 unitary transformations , where the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath185 and each transformation zeros all the elements of a row and column except the diagonal and the element directly above and below the diagonal in that row and column .",
    "furthermore , this routine keeps track of the product of unitary transformations in order to obtain the eigenvectors at the end .",
    "our code is based on the description in numerical recipes @xcite , but modifications to allow for complex numbers and parallelization using openmp @xcite were added .",
    "several checks of this code were performed including testing whether the final unitary transformation ( the product of the individual unitary transformations ) directly triadiagonalized the original matrix and gave the same result as that obtained by the routine in the first place .",
    "the second step uses the so - called qr diagonalization method to bring the matrix into a final diagonal form .",
    "each cycle of the qr diagonalization is implemented as a series of @xmath184 jacobi transformations and brings the final off - diagonal entries closer to zero .",
    "the cycle must then be run multiple times until the off - diagonal entries are below an acceptable level .",
    "as before , our routine keeps track of the product of the transformations in order to obtain the eigenvectors as well as the eigenvalues .",
    "our code is again based on the description in numerical recipes @xcite , and again has modifications to allow for complex numbers and parallelization using openmp .",
    "we performed several checks of this code as well , including testing whether the final unitary transformation obtained from both routines actually diagonalizes the original matrix and gives the eigenvalues obtained by the code .",
    "in this appendix , we would like to give a very rough understanding of the vacuum energy dependence on @xmath49 and @xmath8 in eqs .  ( [ eq : e_vac(dp ) ] ) and ( [ eq : e_vac(lambda ) ] ) . the hamiltonian from eq .",
    "( [ eq : discrete hamiltonian ] ) has the following matrix form when the basis states ( other than the single - particle basis state ) are given in table  [ tab : basis states ] @xmath186 the dependence on @xmath8 is all explicitly given in the hamiltonian .",
    "the dependence on @xmath49 , on the other hand , comes in three forms .",
    "the first is in the explicit dependence in the matrix , the second is in @xmath187 which grows larger with decreasing @xmath49 , and the third is in the size of the matrix which also grows larger with decreasing @xmath49 . in order to understand the vacuum energy s dependence on @xmath49 , all three of these sources are important .",
    "although we can not derive a comprehensive formula showing the dependence of the vacuum energy on both @xmath49 and @xmath8 , we can give an argument showing where some of that dependence comes from .",
    "we begin by studying the effect of @xmath49 on @xmath187 .",
    "in addition to @xmath49 , this sum also depends on @xmath50 and the cutoff momentum @xmath162 . for a given value of @xmath50 and @xmath162",
    ", the value of @xmath49 determines the number of terms in the sum . for example , if @xmath188 , there are three terms in the sum , but if @xmath189 , there are five terms , and so on . in general ,",
    "when @xmath190 , we find that the number of terms in the sum grows as @xmath156 .",
    "if @xmath49 is halved , then the number of terms doubles .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath190 , each term is similar in size to its neighbors , so that @xmath187 grows like @xmath156 . taken together , we find @xmath191 where @xmath192 for the reference parameters given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parameters ] ) . with this relation",
    ", we can see that the @xmath156 in @xmath187 cancels the @xmath49 in the numerator of many hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "plugging this in , we have @xmath193 where @xmath194 is indepdent of @xmath49 and @xmath8 .",
    "although this integral is still impossible to solve analytically , we can solve it analytically if we temporarily simplify by taking the remaining explicit dependence on @xmath95 .",
    "then , we have the matrix @xmath195 of course , this matrix does not give the full behavior of the complete hamiltonian , but it turns out that we can solve it for the vacuum energy .",
    "this matrix is of the form @xmath196 which has the eigenvalues @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the size of the matrix ( the number of rows ) .",
    "going back to the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app : hdp->0 ] ) , we find @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is a function of the cutoff momentum , but is independent of both @xmath49 and @xmath8 .",
    "if we expand this in a taylor series around @xmath106 and @xmath160 , we obtain for the leading term @xmath202 although this form does not take into account the full explicit dependence on @xmath49 in the hamiltonian(and some dependence on @xmath8 is dropped when @xmath49 is taken to zero as well ) , it does include the dependence on @xmath49 in both @xmath187 and in the size of the matrix .",
    "notwithstanding the neglected dependence on @xmath49 and @xmath8 , this result does have the right form .",
    "we find that @xmath203 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_vac(dp ) ] ) and @xmath204 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_vac(lambda ) ] )",

    "<S> quantum field theory ( qft ) allows us to write a manifestly local , lorentz - invariant formulation of the fundamental physics governing relativistic quantum particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , a qft , agrees with all experiments to date , including the high energy particle collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> its structure is sufficiently constraining that it forced theorists to predict the existence of the higgs boson @xcite five decades before its spectacular discovery in 2012 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also sufficiently flexible to allow us to construct models for physics beyond the sm , including neutrino masses , supersymmetry , and dark matter to name a few .    </S>",

    "<S> , the number of feynman diagrams grows exponentially with the number of final state particles and with the number of loops . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a pure theory of gluons , it takes the following numbers of feynman diagrams to calculate scattering rates at tree level : 4 ; 25 ; 220 ; 2,485 ; 34,300 ; 559,405 ; and 10,525,900 feynman diagrams for 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 external particles , respectively @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> , if we go to one loop , the scattering of just seven gluons involves 227,585 feynman diagrams @xcite . in the regimes of ultra - high numbers of feynman diagrams , </S>",
    "<S> the individual diagrams lose their meaning and the calculation becomes challenging or impossible even for computers . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> new methods to calculate the scattering amplitude that bypass feynman diagrams altogether , and indeed sometimes qft itself , are being discovered . </S>",
    "<S> one highlight of this work is the discovery by parke and taylor @xcite that the maximally - helicity - violating tree - level amplitude could be written as an expression with only one term no matter how many thousands of feynman diagrams were involved . </S>",
    "<S> another important highlight is the discovery by britto , cachazo , feng and witten @xcite that any tree - level helicity amplitude of gluons could be calculated using a simple recursion relation based on the asymptotic behavior of the complexified gluon momenta . </S>",
    "<S> since then , much exciting progress has been made and , indeed , continues @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are even some indications that scattering amplitudes , although seemingly ordinary , may be leading us to a much deeper understanding of the combination of special relativity and quantum mechanics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding the enormous progress made by the unitarity - based methods , it seems clear that new techniques for calculating scattering amplitudes that go beyond feynman diagrams would be welcome . in particular , an approach whose approximation scheme was non - perturbative would complement well the existing efforts . in this paper , we begin an exploration of another potential method for calculating the s - matrix and thereby the scattering amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to diagonalize the hamiltonian directly and use the eigenstates to calculate the scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the hamiltonian is infinite dimensional and so this is normally impossible . </S>",
    "<S> however , very briefly , what we suggest is to discretize the hamiltonian by discretizing momentum space ( e.g. by reducing the volume of spacetime to a finite size with boundary conditions ) and cutting the momentum off at an upper limit far above the scale of the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting discrete hamiltonian will be finite and diagonalizable using standard computational techniques . at best , </S>",
    "<S> this will , of course , be an approximation to the diagonalization of the full hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is a non - perturbative approximation and therefore , we believe , potentially complements standard methods .    in slightly greater detail , </S>",
    "<S> our plan is to : a ) legendre transform the lagrangian to obtain the hamiltonian ; b ) use direct products of free - particle states as a complete orthonormal basis ; c ) insert the definitions of the fields in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of free - particle states ; d ) discretize momentum space and therefore the hilbert space ; e ) truncate the basis states by cutting off the energy of the states and thereby make the hilbert space finite ; f ) calculate the numerical hamiltonian matrix elements in the resulting finite hilbert space ; g ) numerically diagonalize the resulting hamiltonian matrix ; and h ) use the resulting eigenstates to calculate the s matrix . </S>",
    "<S> these steps will be further explained in the context of a simplified @xmath0 theory in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : theory ] and the results will be presented in the following sections .    before getting into the details , we should note that there is a ph.d . </S>",

    "<S> although the diagonalization of the hamiltonian is a common goal , our method uses different techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we do not latticize space - time . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we use of a complete set of free - particle product states and the insertion of creation and annihilation operators as a means to calculate the hamiltonian that is then diagonalized . </S>",
