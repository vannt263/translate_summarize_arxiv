    "in spite of its crucial practical importance , friction is still far from being fully explained @xcite . besides a proper explanation of the static friction laws ,",
    "the dynamical aspects of friction are even less understood .",
    "this is exemplified by the problem posed by the lack of a well established mechanism for the familiar stick - slip phenomenon that one perceives with a door s creak or the playing of a violin with a bow .",
    "many phenomena in nature , where one part of a system moves in contact with another part , exhibit such a stick - slip motion which changes to smooth sliding with the increase of the driving velocity @xcite .",
    "microscopically this phenomenon was first explained by robbins and thompson @xcite by a melting - freezing mechanism : a thin lubricant film between the moving surfaces melts during slips and solidifies again at sticks .",
    "such a behavior is typical for conventional , or `` soft '' lubricants , when the lubricant - surface interaction is stronger than the interaction between the lubricant molecules @xcite",
    ". a `` hard '' lubricant , which remains in a solid state during slips , also demonstrates the stick - slip to smooth sliding transition which now emerges due to inertia @xcite . in both cases",
    ", however , the transition from stick - slip to smooth sliding in a planar tribological contact is found to occur at a driving velocity @xmath0  m / s ( where @xmath1 is the sound velocity ) , which is more than six orders of magnitude higher than experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that microscopic mechanisms of stick - slip have little relevance at the macroscopic level .    at the macroscopic scale ,",
    "the stick - slip and smooth - sliding regimes can be explained with a phenomenological theory @xcite .",
    "it is based on a `` contact - age function '' which depends on the previous history of the system .",
    "this theory leads to an excellent agreement with experiments if the model parameters are suitably chosen .",
    "unfortunately , this approach remains purely phenomenological .",
    "the corresponding equations can not be derived from a microscopic - scale analysis .",
    "another explanation is based on earthquake - like models ( the eq model ) such as the burridge - knopoff spring - block model @xcite later developed by olami , feder , and christensen @xcite .",
    "it was adjusted to describe friction by persson  @xcite and then explored in a number of works  @xcite . in this model",
    "the two solid blocks touch one another at point junctions , corresponding to asperities of the surfaces which pin the relative position of the blocks ( fig .",
    "[ a01 ] ) .",
    "a local force , exerted by the moving top block , is associated to each contact , as well as a threshold for breaking .",
    "the model describes friction as resulting from the combined effects of the breaking of contacts and their pinning again after the release of their internal stress .",
    "computer simulations of a simplified variant of the eq model , where all contacts have the same threshold @xcite , showed that the earthquake - like model reproduces the experimentally observed transition from stick - slip to smooth sliding , provided the following assumptions are made : ( _ i _ ) the model must be two - dimensional , ( _ ii _ ) the spatial distribution of contacts must be random , ( _ iii _ ) it should exist an interaction between the contacts , and ( _ iv _ ) the model must incorporate an increase of the static threshold on the time of stationary contact similarly to the `` age - function '' assumption of the phenomenological theory .",
    "recently  @xcite it became clear that a crucial ingredient of the eq - like model in tribological applications is the distribution of static yield thresholds for the breaking of individual contacts .",
    "in the early variants of the model , all contacts had been assumed to be identical for the sake of simplicity , and a distribution of thresholds appeared only implicitly due to temperature fluctuations  @xcite or due to interaction between the contacts  @xcite . as a matter of fact , the eq model with identical contacts is a singular case  @xcite .",
    "it admits a periodic solution which can be interpreted as a form of stick - slip .",
    "nonetheless this solution remains largely unphysical since for example it ceases to exist as soon as nonequivalent contacts are considered , whatever their precise properties .",
    "as soon as a finite width distribution of yield thresholds is taken into account , the solution of the model in the quasi - static limit always approaches a physical solution with smooth sliding  @xcite .",
    "incorporating a threshold distribution that does not evolve by the breaking and re - formation of the contacts allows one to find the steady - state solution of the eq model analytically , and more importantly to find conditions for appearance of the elastic instability , which is the necessary condition for the stick - slip to emerge  @xcite .",
    "the approach based on the earthquake - like model has , however , two weak points .",
    "first , most results can only be obtained with computer simulation .",
    "second , the nature of contacts is not clearly specified . while for two rough solid surfaces the contacts may be associated with real asperities , for two ideal flat mica surfaces in the surface force apparatus ( sfa ) experiments @xcite the nature of contacts is not clear .",
    "persson @xcite supposed that they may correspond to `` solid islands '' in the fluidized lubricant , but such an assumption remains on a speculative level .",
    "therefore , whether one looks at friction from the macroscopic or from the microscopic viewpoint , the theoretical understanding is not satisfactory .",
    "what is lacking is a theory that would not separately consider the two extreme limits , macroscopic or microscopic , but couple them in a mesoscale approach .",
    "our goal in the present work is to explore an intermediate approach , which starts from the properties of individual contacts and deduces macroscopic laws from an analytical description based on a statistical analysis .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the introduction of statistics in the theory of friction @xcite already allowed a significant progress in the understanding of _ static _ friction , but here we are concerned with _ dynamical aspects _ which enter through the continuous breaking and re - forming of many local contacts .",
    "we introduce a master equation ( me ) which describes this phenomenon and couples local events with macroscopic properties .",
    "it can be solved analytically in cases which are particularly relevant , or studied numerically in more complex situations , much more efficiently than with simulations of discrete eq models .",
    "its major interest is to split the analysis in two independent parts : ( _ i _ ) the calculation of the friction force given by the master equation provided the statistical properties of the contacts are known , and ( _ ii _ ) the study of the statistical properties of the contacts , which may need inputs from the microscopic scale .",
    "a preliminary report of the results have been presented in a short letter @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the master equation approach more thoroughly and explore some of the consequences of this new viewpoint on friction by examining several issues such as temperature effects ( sec .",

    "<S> at the mesoscale friction occurs through the breaking and formation of local contacts . </S>",
    "<S> this is often described by the earthquake - like model which requires numerical studies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this phenomenon can also be described by a master equation , which can be solved analytically in some cases and provides an efficient numerical solution for more general cases . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the effect of temperature and aging of the contacts and discuss the statistical properties of the contacts for different situations of friction and their implications , particularly regarding the existence of stick - slip . </S>"
