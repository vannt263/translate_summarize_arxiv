    "the cause of several physical and biological processes can be attributed to diffusion .",
    "notable examples are heat conduction , brownian motion and the transport of materials within cells . at the microscopic level , diffusion is due to random collisions between the particles of the system under study and those of a background substance . at the macroscopic scale , in which random effects are averaged ,",
    "diffusion is described by an effective , deterministic theory .",
    "the macroscopic physical quantities are solutions of partial differential equations , such as the heat equation or the fokker - planck equation . the applications of such theories go well beyond the original physical motivations and include fields as different as image processing , economics and social sciences .    the purpose of this paper is to propose and explore the idea that diffusion may also play a fundamental role in the large scale dynamics of the matter in the universe .",
    "the standard assumption in cosmology is that the galaxies ( in which most of ordinary matter is supposed to be concentrated ) can be represented as the particles of a fluid . here",
    "it will be further assumed that the fluid particles undergo velocity diffusion .",
    "the model will be developed within einstein theory of general relativity with a cosmological scalar field , the latter playing the role of the background medium in which diffusion takes place .",
    "the general relativistic theory of diffusion processes has received considerable attention in recent years , see for instance  @xcite . as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 and the current density @xmath1 of matter undergoing velocity diffusion satisfy the equations @xmath2 and @xmath3 here @xmath4 denotes the levi civita covariant differentiation on a spacetime @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a positive dimensional constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite the matter field is given by the one - particle kinetic distribution function @xmath7 in phase space , and the tensor fields @xmath0 , @xmath1 are defined by suitable integrals of @xmath7 in the momentum variable . the relation   is a consequence of the evolution equation satisfied by @xmath7 , which is a degenerate fokker - planck equation without friction on the tangent bundle of spacetime .",
    "hence the model studied in  @xcite describes the kinetic motion of an ensemble of particles undergoing diffusion in the velocity variable .",
    "the right hand side of   is a macroscopic representation of the diffusion forces acting on the particles , and @xmath6 is the diffusion constant , which measures the average energy transferred per unit time from the background substance to a fluid particle .",
    "this paper is concerned with fluid matter models with energy - momentum tensor and current density @xmath8 that satisfy @xmath9 the scalar functions @xmath10 represent respectively the rest - frame energy density , the pressure and the number density of the fluid , while the vector field @xmath11 , is the four - velocity of the fluid",
    ". motivated by the kinetic model introduced in  @xcite , an ideal fluid that satisfies   will be said to undergo ( molecular ) velocity diffusion and the parameter @xmath6 will be called diffusion constant in the present context as well .",
    "note that in the present paper the factor 3 in the right hand side of   is absorbed in the definition of the diffusion constant .",
    ".   is equivalent to the following equations @xmath12 which are obtained by projecting   into the direction of @xmath13 and onto the hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "note that the euler equation   is the same as in the diffusion - free case ; only the continuity equation   is affected by the presence of diffusion .",
    "this is due to the fact that the diffusion force @xmath14 acts on the direction of the matter flow .    to transform   into a complete system on the variables @xmath15 , an equation of state must be added . letting the energy per particle @xmath16 and",
    "the specific volume @xmath17 be defined as @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , the first law of thermodynamics states that @xmath20 where the scalar functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote respectively the temperature and the entropy of the fluid .",
    "units are chosen so that boltzmann s constant is equal to one .",
    "an equation of state relating the thermodynamic variables may be prescribed in the form @xmath23 for some function @xmath24 , which for simplicity will be assumed to be continuously differentiable . substituting in   we obtain @xmath25 for ordinary fluids the specific enthalpy @xmath26 and the temperature @xmath21",
    "are required to be positive , which implies that @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "then by   and   we obtain @xmath30 the equations  ,  ,  ,  ,   provide the desired complete system for describing the evolution of the matter field variables @xmath31 .",
    ".   can be replaced by eq .",
    ", since they are equivalent when   holds .",
    "note also that the entropy of the fluid is strictly increasing along the matter flow , unless diffusion is switched off ( i.e. , @xmath6 is set to zero ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that diffusion is an irreversible process .    for the applications in cosmology , the case when the pressure @xmath32 and the rest - frame energy density @xmath33 are connected by a linear relation @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is particularly important . by   this",
    "can be achieved by choosing @xmath36 where @xmath37 to ensure @xmath38 and @xmath39 to ensure positivity of @xmath21 . in this situation ,",
    "the entropy variable @xmath22 can be replaced by the modified entropy @xmath40 and   simplifies to @xmath41    the consistent description of any matter dynamics in general relativity requires the coupling with the einstein equation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ricci tensor of the metric @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however it is clear that fluid matter undergoing velocity diffusion can not appear as the only source in the einstein equation .",
    "in fact the bianchi identity @xmath46 implies that solutions of the einstein equation can only exist if @xmath47 . the physical reason for this incompatibility",
    "is that our new fluid model does not take into account the interaction between the particles undergoing diffusion and the background medium in which diffusion takes place .",
    "while the diffusion approximation in newtonian mechanics consists exactly in neglecting this interaction  @xcite , we see that in general relativity such an approximation , which leads inevitably to a model that does not preserve energy , is inconsistent .",
    "the next best  diffusion approximation \" consists in assuming the simplest possible interaction with the background medium . an interesting choice , because of its simplicity and because it leads to a natural generalization of the cosmological constant assumption , is to model the effect of the background medium by a scalar field according to the following modification of  : @xmath48 the scalar field @xmath49 will be called _ cosmological scalar field _ , since it enters in   in the place where the cosmological constant @xmath50 is commonly introduced .",
    "it should be emphasized once again that the cosmological scalar field is not to be interpreted as ordinary matter , but rather as a background field which , interacting with the fluid particles , causes their diffusion . according to particle physics",
    ", @xmath49 plays the role of the vacuum energy . by",
    ", the cosmological scalar field satisfies the equation @xmath51 there are a number of important properties that one can infer from  .",
    "firstly ,   forces the matter flow to be irrotational : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the vorticity tensor of the fluid .",
    "secondly , @xmath49 satisfies the transport equation @xmath54 which shows that @xmath49 is decreasing along the matter flow .",
    "finally , since the fluid number density is assumed to be a conserved quantity , i.e. , @xmath55 , the cosmological scalar field satisfies the homogeneous wave equation @xmath56 it follows by   that the canonical energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field is divergence - free : @xmath57 note however that this energy - momentum tensor is not added as a source in the einstein equation  .",
    "this again is due to our interpretation of @xmath49 as a background medium , rather than an ordinary matter field .    in conclusion the cosmological scalar field",
    "@xmath49 propagates through spacetime in form of waves without dissipation and interacts with the fluid particles causing their diffusion ; as a consequence of this interaction , the scalar field @xmath49 is decreasing along the matter flow , which can be interpreted as vacuum energy being transferred to the fluid particles . in the absence of diffusion ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath58 , @xmath49 is constant and   reduces to the einstein equation with cosmological constant .",
    "next we consider spatially homogeneous and isotropic solutions , for which the line element can be written in the form @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the scale factor , @xmath61 or @xmath62 is the curvature parameter of the hypersurfaces @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the invariant surface element on the unit sphere .",
    "this class of solutions is the most important and widely used for the applications in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "let us write the fluid equations derived previously on a lorentzian manifold with line element  . in this case",
    "the matter field variables are functions of @xmath65 only .",
    "moreover we assume that @xmath66 is given by  , which implies that @xmath67 , for some constant @xmath68 .",
    "although this is not always necessary in what follows , it will be assumed that @xmath69 ; in particular the fluid satisfies the strong and the dominant energy condition .",
    "the conservation of particles number , eq .",
    ", implies @xmath70 where a subscript @xmath71 means evaluation at time @xmath72 .",
    "the equation   on the modified entropy @xmath73 becomes @xmath74 where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath65 .",
    "next the equations on the geometric fields will be considered .",
    "the equation   on the cosmological scalar field @xmath49 becomes @xmath75 while the einstein equation   entails @xmath76-h^2,\\label{heq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 @xmath78 denotes the hubble function . for any specific choice of @xmath68 and @xmath79 , the equations   form a complete system for the fluid variables @xmath80 , the scale factor @xmath81 , the hubble function @xmath78 and the cosmological scalar field @xmath49 .",
    "the initial data consist of @xmath82 , @xmath83 such that   is satisfied at time @xmath72 . identifying @xmath72 with the present value of the cosmological time ,",
    "it is physically justified to assume @xmath84  since the universe is currently expanding  and @xmath85  since @xmath86 corresponds to the present observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "it will also be assumed of course that @xmath87 .    in the following the global behavior of solutions to   in the flat case ( @xmath61 ) will be analyzed .",
    "let us start by recalling the global behavior of the analogous diffusion - free cosmological model ( @xmath58 ) . in the absence of diffusion ,",
    "one recovers the einstein - perfect fluid system with non - negative cosmological constant @xmath88 . in this case",
    "it is well known that the model develops a singularity in finite time in the past , while in the future it is singularity - free and forever expanding .",
    "( in fact , one can even solve explicitly the equations in this case , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "it will now be shown that when diffusion is switched on , the past and future qualitative behavior of the universe may be completely different .    since @xmath61",
    ", we can introduce cartesian coordinates @xmath89 such that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath85 and @xmath49 is decreasing , the cosmological scalar field is always positive in the past , causing accelerated expansion of the universe , and could become negative at later times .",
    "if this happens the universe is doomed to collapse into a singularity in finite time .",
    "in fact if @xmath92 at some time @xmath93 , then by   we will have @xmath94 for all @xmath95 and therefore there exists a time @xmath96 such that @xmath97 as @xmath98 , which implies @xmath99 as @xmath98 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath100 never vanishes , then the cosmological model will be singularity free and forever expanding in the future .",
    "this is a trivial consequence of  @xmath101 , which shows that @xmath78 never vanishes if @xmath102 , and therefore , since @xmath84 , it will remain positive for all times .",
    "let @xmath103 .",
    "it will now be shown that when @xmath104 , the metric behaves asymptotically as the de sitter solution , precisely @xmath105 in fact , by lhpital s rule , @xmath106 moreover by  - , @xmath107 whence @xmath108 , and thus @xmath109 , as @xmath110 . by by  ,",
    "@xmath111 , which implies  .",
    "the behavior of the cosmological model in the past is more sensitive to the choice of the initial value @xmath112 rather than @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath112 is sufficiently small , the modified entropy @xmath73 could vanish at some negative time @xmath113 , while @xmath114 is still positive .",
    "( for instance , in the case of dust ( @xmath115 ) , the solution of   is @xmath116 and therefore @xmath117 . ) if this happens , the energy density @xmath33 becomes negative and therefore the solution is unphysical for @xmath118 , even if the metric of spacetime remains smooth .",
    "however a physically viable and interesting cosmological model can be constructed by matching the metric at the time @xmath113 with the de sitter solution @xmath119 , where the constant @xmath120 is such that @xmath121 .",
    "the resulting cosmological model has no big - bang singularity and is vacuum up to the time @xmath113 ( since @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 ) , at which time the vacuum energy @xmath125 starts to be converted into matter energy @xmath33 .",
    "the other possibility is that the scalar factor vanishes while the modified entropy is still positive . in this case",
    "a big - bang singularity forms in the past .",
    "figures  [ bigbang ] and  [ nobigbang ] show examples of solutions obtained numerically .",
    "the solutions depicted in figure 1 have a big - bang singularity in the past , while those on figure 2 do not .",
    "moreover , the solutions depicted are all dust solutions ( @xmath115 ) and the constants @xmath126 have been fixed to one .",
    "thus @xmath127 in all pictures .",
    "similar solutions can be obtained for @xmath128 and for all other values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( no matter how small ) .",
    "whether any of these solutions may represent the actual behavior of our universe requires of course experimental evidence .",
    "in particular , while observational constraints are available for the values of @xmath131 , the possibility that @xmath130 remains open .",
    "the only free parameter in the solution   is @xmath133 , thus it is highly non - generic .",
    "the qualitative behavior of this solution is similar to the one depicted in figure  [ bigbang](b ) .",
    "note also that for @xmath58 the solution reduces to @xmath134 , which corresponds to minkowski spacetime .",
    "thus the solution   is a  pure diffusion \" one ."
