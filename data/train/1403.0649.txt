    "the fascinating topological structure of borromean rings has attracted much attention in biology  @xcite and chemistry  @xcite ; while in physics , their quantum mechanical analog , the borromean binding , has been reported in halo nuclei @xmath0he and @xmath1li  @xcite and in ultracold atomic gases   @xcite manifested as the efimov effect  @xcite . despite its wide existence in nature , the borromean phenomenon seems quite intricate and peculiar , as it especially requires three bodies being more favorably bound than two bodies .",
    "previous studies have shown that such a requirement can be fulfilled by fine - tuning the pairwise short - range interaction potentials .",
    "for instance , in three dimensions ( 3d ) , the coupling constant should vary with the specific shape of the short - range potential  @xcite , while in two dimensions ( 2d ) , it is necessary for the potential to include a repulsive barrier outside an attractive core  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for efimov - type borromean states , a short - range ( three - body ) parameter is essential to uniquely determine the binding energies as well as the locations of their emergence  @xcite . in all these studies , the borromean binding appears to be a non - universal phenomenon , which inevitably relies on the short - range details of interaction potentials .",
    "this non - universality makes a unified understanding of the borromean binding conceptually difficult , and renders its experimental detection inconveniently system - dependent .    to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we aim at engineering a _ universal _ borromean binding , where the short - range interaction details are completely irrelevant and its occurrence is physically transparent",
    ". motivated by a simple fact that few - body physics also crucially depend on single - particle properties , we realize that a potential route toward our goal is through the modification of single - particle physics . in ultracold atomic gases , an outstanding candidate to achieve",
    "this is the synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc )  @xcite , with the form of soc highly tunable according to a number of proposals  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the significant change of single - particle dispersion by soc has been shown to result in rich and exciting physics in few- and many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been found that an isotropic soc can support dimer for arbitrarily weak interactions  @xcite , and can induce universal trimer in a wide parameter regime of interaction strength and mass ratio  @xcite .",
    "these are in distinct contrast to the dimer and the kartavtsev - malykh trimer  @xcite in the absence of soc .",
    "so far , however , no universal borromean binding has yet been identified .    in this work",
    "we report the discovery of _ universal _ borromean bindings in ultracold fermi - fermi mixtures with rashba soc .",
    "the three - body system can be denoted as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a two - component fermion subject to rashba soc , with one of its components tuned close to a wide feshbach resonance with the @xmath4 atom  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for the borromean binding in this system is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] . under rashba",
    "soc , the single - particle ground state of @xmath3 possesses a u(1 ) degeneracy ( see fig .",
    "[ schematic](a ) ) .",
    "with such a spectral symmetry , the two - body ( @xmath5 ) scattering within the lowest energy subspace is blocked due to total momentum conservation ( fig .",
    "[ schematic](b ) ) , which effectively suppresses the dimer formation .",
    "in contrast , the three - body scattering can take full advantage of this u(1 ) degeneracy , where an initial state of @xmath2 atoms at @xmath6 can be scattered to a different state at @xmath7 with a conserved total momentum ( fig .",
    "[ schematic](c ) ) . here ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 both lie on the circle of the u(1 ) degenerate manifold of @xmath3 .",
    "this enhanced low - energy scattering phase space strongly suggests the trimer formation be much easier than the dimer formation , which , as we will show , would give rise to the borromean binding .",
    "as the emergence of this borromean binding is symmetry - selective rather than interaction - selective , its universality is naturally guaranteed : the binding energy only relies on the s - wave scattering length and the soc strength .",
    "we identify the existence of such bindings in a wide range of mass ratio between composing fermions , which are readily accessible by li - li , k - k and k - li mixtures in current cold atoms experiments .",
    "the robustness of this borromean binding suggests the importance of the single - particle spectral symmetry in few - body physics , which has rarely been discussed before .",
    "( a ) under rashba soc , the single - particle ground state of @xmath3 has a u(1 ) degeneracy in the @xmath10 plane with radius @xmath11 .",
    "( b ) the two - body @xmath5 system can not scatter within the lowest energy subspace due to the conservation of total momentum .",
    "( c ) in contrast , the scattering of the three - body @xmath2 system is allowed within the lowest energy subspace through virtual scattering to states like @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( green dashed arrows ) .",
    "the dramatic enhancement of low - energy scattering phase space in ( c ) gives rise to the borromean binding.,width=302 ]",
    "the hamiltonian of our system is written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the strength of rashba soc between two spin species ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath3-atom ; @xmath17 is the bare interaction between @xmath18 and @xmath4 , and is related to the s - wave scattering length @xmath19 via @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the quantization volume and @xmath22 the reduced mass . as",

    "as expected , when @xmath42 increases , the trimer is found to emerge well before the dimer , which leads to the occurrence of the borromean binding . for the @xmath66k-@xmath66k-@xmath67li system ,",
    "the borromean state is stable within the range of @xmath96 , while the most tightly bound borromean occurs at the phase boundary against the ordinary trimer , i.e. , when the dimer starts to develop at @xmath97 . at this point",
    ", the borromean binding energy can be as large as nearly @xmath98 of the soc energy @xmath51 .",
    "the ordinary trimer finally merges into the atom - dimer threshold at a larger @xmath99 .    to gain further understanding of the binding mechanism , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) the momentum distribution of the borromean state at @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast to that of dimers shown in fig .  [ 2_body](b1,b2 ) , here the most weight of the probability distribution , @xmath100 , spreads along the u(1 ) circle in the lowest energy subspace for @xmath3 atoms .",
    "thus , scattering among these low - energy states contributes the most to the bound state formation , consistent with the schematics in fig .",
    "[ schematic](c ) .    an outstanding feature of the borromean binding in the current system is its universality , i.e. the binding energy does not rely on the short - range interaction details .",
    "this can be shown by imposing different high - momentum cutoffs @xmath95 for the argument of @xmath101-function in eq.([3_body_eq ] ) , @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , we plot @xmath68 as a function of @xmath94 for the borromean binding at @xmath91 .",

    "the universality of the borromean binding here distinguishes itself from those in the previous studies where the short - range ( or high - energy ) details of the interaction potential play essential roles .     and",
    "the lower and upper solid curves respectively show the threshold of borromean ( `` b '' ) binding and the boundary at which the ordinary trimer ( `` t '' ) merges into the atom - dimer continuum ( `` ad '' ) .",
    "the blue dashed curve is the dimer threshold ( see fig .  [ 2_body](a ) ) , which also marks the boundary between `` b '' and `` t '' for @xmath105 .",
    ", width=283 ]    furthermore , we find that the borromean binding in the current system is remarkably robust . as shown in the ground state phase diagram for the @xmath2 system in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , the borromean binding can be stabilized over a wide range of mass ratio with @xmath105 , thus covering all li - li - li , k - k - k , and k - k - li systems .",
    "we have checked that the momentum distributions of these borromean states for different @xmath57 all exhibit similar structures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "therefore , these borromean states all share the same binding mechanism , which is closely related to the spectral symmetry in the low - energy manifold due to rashba soc ( see fig .  [ schematic ] ) .",
    "this mechanism also insures the robustness of such a binding against changes in the spin dependence of the interaction .",
    "our results are thus not limited to the spin - selective interaction considered in this work .",
    "the universal borromean bindings demonstrated in our work are expected to have dramatic effects on the many - body system . with the borromean binding energy on the same order of the soc energy , a dilute gas with strong soc",
    "is anticipated to be comprised of self - bound borromean clusters , which function as composite fermions . moreover , as the emergence of such a binding is associated with the three - body scattering resonance , a scattering system near this resonance will exhibit strong three - body correlations which dominate over the two - body ones .",
    "these prominent three - body correlations would potentially lead to intriguing collective phenomena in both the attractive and the scattering branches of the underlying fermion system .",
    "finally , we remark that the mechanism of universal borromean bindings established in this work can be generalized to a vast class of systems , where the single - particle spectral symmetry is modified by intrinsic or external potentials .",
    "our work thus paves the way for the study of systems where the single - particle physics , instead of interaction details , plays the dominant role in generating exotic few - body correlations which should lead to new quantum phases in many - body systems .",
