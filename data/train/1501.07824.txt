    "the peculiar velocities of traditional ` runaway ' stars are typically greater than 30 km / s . in the solar neighbourhood",
    "approximately @xmath0  @xmath1 of o - type stars and @xmath2  @xmath0 of b - type stars are runaways ( gies @xcite , stone @xcite ) .",
    "most runaway stars are ejected from the galactic plane shortly after their formation ( ramspeck _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in 2005",
    "a late b - type star was discovered in the outer halo having a heliocentric radial velocity of 853 @xmath3 12 km / s , which is significantly in excess of the galactic escape speed at that location ( brown _ et al . _",
    "such stars are called ` hypervelocity stars ' ( hvs ) . hills ( @xcite ) predicted the existence of hvss , suggesting that they can form via tidal disruption of a stellar binary by the central supermassive black hole of the milky way . in this scenario one of the binary stars",
    "is captured by the black hole , while the other is ejected , often at an extremely high velocity .",
    "currently around 27 a / b / o - type unbound hvss have been identified in recent years ( for example , brown _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and references therein , zheng _ et al . _",
    "other low - mass f / g / m - type hvs candidates have been claimed ( li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , palladino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , zhong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , but most of these studies have found that their hvs candidates are not consistent with galactic centre ejection . in this work we use the sloan digital sky survey s stripe 82 data to identify new low - mass hypervelocity star candidates .",
    "stripe 82 is a 250 deg@xmath4 field along the celestial equator in the south galactic cap , which has been repeatedly imaged by sdss over 7 years allowing for studies of the variable sky and identification of many kinds of transient phenomena ( e.g. sesar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , watkins _",
    "@xcite ) . the stripe",
    "82 dataset has also been used to construct high accuracy proper motion catalogues ( bramich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , koposov _ et al . _",
    "these catalogues have been exploited to hunt for white dwarfs ( vidrih _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and analyse the kinematic properties of galactic disc and halo stars ( smith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    using this dataset",
    "we have attempted to find nearby hypervelocity star candidates .",
    "we first de - reddened all photometry using the maps of schlegel _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we then identify red main - sequence stars following bond _",
    "@xcite : @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "however , since the majority of very high proper motion stars are nearby white dwarfs , we exclude these by removing all objects bluer than @xmath7 . in order to estimate a distance ( and hence tangential velocity ) we need to know the metallicity of these stars . although reliable photometric metallicity estimators exist ( e.g. ivezi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , these are not applicable to k / m stars .",
    "therefore we have conservatively assumed at this stage that their metallicity is -2 dex , which provides a conservative estimate on the tangential velocity ( see section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we adopt the photometric distance relation of ivezi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( including the turn - off correction of smith _ et al . _",
    "we then choose all stars with heliocentric tangential velocity larger than 400 km / s and proper motion errors less than 1 mas / yr . this results in a sample of 11 hvss candidates .",
    "we check the proper motions of our candidate hvss using the data from ( bramich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , as can be seen in figure [ fig : propermotion ] .",
    "clearly our four best candidates are fast moving , meaning that there are no spurious high proper motion stars .",
    "this is often a problem for candidate hvss obtained using catalogues constructed from cross - matching different surveys ( see vickers _",
    "@xcite ) .          in order to determine the full 3d velocities we needed spectroscopy of these 11 candidates , which we obtained using double spectrograph on the hale 200-inch telescope at palomar observatory .",
    "our resolution was around r @xmath8 2000 , giving an internal accuracy of a few km / s .",
    ".nearby hypervelocity star candidates [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in conclusion , we have presented a sample of candidate hypervelocity stars that may be unbound from the milky way .",
    "accurate proper motions and distances are crucial to such analyses . we have overcome the former using the reliable , high - precision stripe 82 catalogue ( bramich _ et al . _ @xcite ) .",
    "we are less certain on the latter , as we need to know the metallicity of our candidates before we can pin down their distances .",
    "we are now working on estimating metallicity from our spectra and will report our findings in a future work .",
    "clearly gaia will revolutionise our understanding of the population of unbound stars in the milky way and studies like ours show the potential from even very small samples ( in our case only 250 deg@xmath4 ) .",
    "curiously , all of our four best candidates are infalling , which means that none are consistent with galactic centre ejection .",
    "currently the origin of low mass hvss is controversial and this is something we aim to address in future work .",
