    "_ * theoretical predictions of epidemic threshold . * _ in the sir pattern of the spread of disease though a network , at any given time each node is either susceptible , infected , or recovered .",
    "a susceptible node does not transmit the disease .",
    "infected nodes contract the disease and spread it to their neighbors .",
    "a recovered node has returned to health and no longer spreads the disease . to initiate the epidemic , we randomly select a",
    "`` seed '' node and designate all other nodes susceptible . at each time step ,",
    "infected nodes transmit the disease to susceptible neighbors with a probability @xmath2 .",
    "infected nodes can also recover with a probability @xmath3 .",
    "the spreading terminates when all infected nodes have recovered .",
    "the spreading dynamics can be characterized by the effective spreading rate @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath5 is below the epidemic threshold @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , the disease spreads locally ( i.e. , only a tiny fraction of nodes transmit the disease ) .",
    "epidemics can occur when @xmath8 ( i.e. , when a finite fraction of nodes transmit the disease ) .    the mean - field like ( mfl ) method , the quenched mean - field ( qmf ) method , and the dynamical message passing ( dmp ) method",
    "are commonly - used theoretical methods of predicting an epidemic threshold . in this section",
    "we clarify the relationships among these epidemic thresholds predicted by the three theoretical methods .    the mean - field like ( mfl ) method incorporates the heterogeneous mean - field theory , percolation theory , the edge - based compartmental approach , and the pairwise approximation method .",
    "here the epidemic threshold is predicted by using only the degree distribution , and it is assumed that ( i ) all the nodes and edges in a given class are statistically equivalent , ( ii ) the states of nodes among neighbors are independent , and ( iii ) the network size is infinite . using the degree distribution @xmath9 as the only input parameter , the theoretical epidemic threshold prediction using the mfl method is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the first and second moments of the degree distribution , respectively .",
    "although @xmath13 is a good predictor of the epidemic threshold in uncorrelated networks , the prediction may fail in real - world networks because of their complex structure ( e.g. , degree - degree correlations , clustering , and community ) and the strong dynamical correlations among the states of neighbors  @xcite .",
    "the quenched mean - field ( qmf ) method @xcite takes into account the complete network structure by using the adjacent matrix @xmath14 .",
    "this distinguishes it from the mfl method , which simply uses the degree distribution .",
    "the adjacent matrix @xmath14 is also used to describe network topology by the discrete - time markov chain  @xcite , the @xmath1-intertwined method  @xcite , and other similar methods , and thus they fall into the same class as the qmf method .",
    "the qmf method is unable to capture the dynamical correlations among the states of neighbors and uses only the correlation between the theoretical epidemic threshold and the leading eigenvalue of the adjacent matrix to predict the epidemic threshold , i.e. , @xmath15 where the leading eigenvalue of the adjacent matrix is  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a column vector with @xmath1 elements , and @xmath1 is the network size .",
    "the dynamical message passing ( dmp ) method was recently developed and used to study nonreversible epidemic spreading dynamics in an sir modeled finite - sized network @xcite .",
    "the dmp method uses the non - backtracking matrix to determine the complete network structure .",
    "this method can both describe the complete network structure and capture some of the dynamical correlations among the states of neighbors that are neglected in the mfl and qmf methods .",
    "in large sparse networks the dmp method provides a good estimation of the epidemic threshold , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the leading eigenvalue of the non - backtracking matrix @xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a @xmath22 unit matrix , @xmath23 is the diagonal matrix with the vertex degrees along its diagonal , and @xmath24 is a @xmath22 null matrix .",
    "the three theoretical predictions of epidemic threshold are closely correlated . in any given network",
    "they distinct , e.g. , @xmath25 is less than @xmath26  @xcite . to determine other relationships among the three theoretical thresholds , we assume that @xmath5 is a eigenvalue of non - backtracking matrix @xmath27 and that @xmath28 is the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath5 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the first and last @xmath1 elements of vector @xmath31 , respectively .",

    "the nonbacktracking centrality of a node is proportional to its degree  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath38 . here",
    "the theoretical prediction @xmath39 using the dmp method is the same as @xmath13 using the mfl method .    to examine the eigenvalue relationships between the adjacent matrix and non - backtracking matrix , we insert the second equation of ( [ sep ] ) into the first equation and obtain @xmath40 multiplying @xmath41 on both sides of eq .",

    "the minimum degree is @xmath76 , and the maximum degree @xmath62 is set at @xmath77 , which ensures that there will be no degree - degree correlations .",
    "two values , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , are considered . according to definition  @xcite , networks with @xmath78 are lkns and networks with @xmath79 are lhns .",

    "we find that the relative and absolute errors between the theoretical and numerical predictions increase with ipr , i.e. , the qmf and dmp methods deviate from the accurate epidemic threshold more easily when ipr is large because the eigenvector centralities of adjacent and non - backtracking matrixes are localized on hub nodes or high @xmath0-core index nodes  @xcite",
