    "the discovery of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors , however , it became clear that thermal fluctuations can play an important role in the behavior of the flux lines arrays .",
    "@xcite the competition between interactions , pinning , and thermal fluctuations gives rise to a wide range of novel phenomena .",
    "for example , it is now clear that the triangular flux lattice melts via a first order transition  @xcite in clean materials , giving rise to an entangled flux liquid  @xcite over a significant part of the phase diagram .",
    "here we investigate the behavior of an interacting system of flux lines in a periodic array of columnar defects .",
    "traditionally , columnar defects are made in high - temperature superconductors by heavy - ion bombardment .",
    "@xcite the ions pass through the sample , leaving amorphous damage tracks in their wake , which act very effectively as pinning sites for the flux lines , provided the lines are aligned with the defects .",
    "pinning is efficient in this case because the dimensions of the flux lines are comparable to those of the pins : both the vortices and the columnar defects are extended over the length of the sample in one direction , and the vortex core size ( @xmath2 ) is comparable to the width of the damage tracks ( @xmath3 ) . by covering the sample with a mask with a periodic array of holes through which the ions can pass , a periodic array of pins ( or clusters of pins ) could be formed .",
    "there are , however , other promising approaches to forming a periodic array of columnar defects in which the artificial pinning centers are able to accommodate multiple vortex lines per pin .",
    "such structures have in fact already been made both in thick  @xcite and thin samples ,  @xcite and one goal of this paper is to understand effects of thermal fluctuations and entanglement when the materials are very thick .",
    "the work of cooley _",
    "et al_.  @xcite is of particular interest to us , because their samples can potentially be used in two different ways to test our theories .",
    "their samples have a regular lattice of pins within an `` island . ''",
    "the islands are themselves spaced periodically through the sample .",
    "we may use our theory to predict behavior of the pins within a single island ; or , we may view each island as a large pinning center capable of accommodating many vortices and apply our theories to that as well .",
    "the lattices are triangular in either case .",
    "we here describe effects expected to be observed in square lattices of pinning sites ; it is straightforward but tedious to generalize our results to triangular lattices as well .",
    "another motivation for examining flux lines in the presence of an ordered array of columnar pins is to better understand computer simulations such as those by li and teitel  @xcite and others  @xcite which attempt to model flux lines in cuprate superconductors .",
    "these authors use an underlying discretization ( such as a stack of triangular lattices ) for the simulations .",
    "although layering along the _ c_-axis is an important feature of real cuprates , the relatively coarse mesh of allowed sites for vortices in each layer is clearly an artifact of the simulations .",
    "as we shall see , the presence of such periodicity can cause significant changes ( such as a transverse meissner effect ) in the behavior of the flux lines .",
    "the very existence of a periodic `` mott insulator '' phase in these simulations ( see below ) with its massive phonon modes and infinite tilt modulus , is an artifact of the lattice discretization . in the absence of a lattice",
    ", the mott insulator phase would be replaced by an abrikosov crystalline phase with finite elastic constants .",
    "our investigation can begin to delimit the circumstances under which lattice approximations fail as models of real materials , and to predict what kind of behavior might be observed when they do fail .    as a third motivation",
    ", we hope that studies such as this will lead to a better understanding of interacting flux lines with tilted field in a _ random _ array of columnar defects .  @xcite",
    "although the extension of the standard theory of disordered superfluids to vortex lines with tilted magnetic fields is straightforward in principle  @xcite there are still poorly understood aspects of this problem .    to understand how our model differs from conventional lattice boson hubbard models ,  @xcite consider the transfer matrix generated by the classical partition function for wiggling vortex lines in @xmath4 dimensions",

    "the parameter @xmath9 controls vortex hopping between columns , @xmath10 is a chemical potential that depends on the component of the external field @xmath11 parallel to the columns , and @xmath12 represents the penalty for multiple vortices on a single defect .",

    "the complex spectra which arise when @xmath17 and @xmath18 varies randomly from site to site has aroused considerable interest recently .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we study how this non - hermiticity affects excitations and other features of the mott insulator and superfluid phases .    before discussing the interacting case , consider a system of _ noninteracting _ flux lines in the presence of a periodic array of columnar pins . at very low temperatures in thin samples",
    ", each vortex will be tightly bound to a particular pin , and fluctuations away from the pinning sites will be small .",
    "however , a flux line can gain entropy by hopping from one defect to another .",
    "for an infinitely thick sample , the vortices will in fact be delocalized at _ any _ nonzero temperature . in the quantum analogy , this delocalization is a consequence of the periodicity of the pinning potential and bloch s theorem .",
    "@xcite although the distance in the @xmath19-direction between intercolumn hops diverges as the temperature is lowered to zero ,  @xcite we will assume sufficiently thick samples and high temperatures so that an individual vortex hops repeatedly as it traverses the sample .",
    "such delocalized states are easy to tilt and will have a finite linear resistance , because transport in the presence of a lorentz force will be aided by finite concentration of kinks in equilibrium .",
    "@xcite hopping from one columnar pin to another _ can not _ be neglected at finite temperatures in thick samples , even if such events are relatively rare .",
    "we now discuss qualitatively the interacting case .",
    "consider an external magnetic field @xmath11 such that there is exactly one flux line per columnar pin , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "if the pins are strong enough , the ground state will be a square lattice of vortices rather than the usual triangular array that is observed in the absence of pins .",
    "thermal fluctuations allow the lines to make short excursions away from the columnar pins which lowers the effective strength of the pins .  @xcite more substantive changes arise if thermal disorder also leads to hops from one pin to another , as for the noninteracting flux lines discussed above .",
    "however , the interactions inhibit hopping , due to the extra energy cost of double occupancy .",
    "@xcite although hopping increases the entropy per unit length , this is insufficient to overcome the energy barrier at low temperatures . above a certain critical temperature @xmath21 , however , the entropy gain dominates , and the flux lines can hop freely from pin to pin . in the quantum analogy , this phase change is the boson mott transition  @xcite between a @xmath22 mott insulator ( square vortex lattice ) and a @xmath22 superfluid ( entangled vortex liquid ) .",

    "1 can lower the entropy without forcing two flux lines to occupy the same column , and always delocalize lines in sufficiently thick samples even in the crystalline phase .",
    "however , such defects can not mediate vortex transport or tilt  if one flux line moves to the right , another must move to the left , so there is no net change .",
    "thus it will not be until the temperature rises above the critical temperature mentioned above that there will be any linear resistance or response to a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "consider now raising the applied magnetic field @xmath25 , always keeping it parallel to the column direction . in the absence of columnar pins ,",
    "the lattice spacing would simply shrink ; however , if the pins are strong enough , a change in the lattice constant would sacrifice the energy benefit of commensurability with the lattice of pinning sites .",
    "an alternative response is the introduction of extra vortices into the commensurate lattice .",
    "depending on the pinning strength , the additional vortices will either doubly occupy certain columnar pins , or else occupy interstitial sites ; either possibility costs an extra energy cost per unit length .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the cost of double occupancy is lower  @xcite , and call the resulting extra vortex a `` particle '' excitation .",
    "this `` particle '' has an energy per unit length of order the cost of double occupancy ; however , it can gain entropy by hopping from pin to pin , and thus lower its _",

    "similar screening arises if one attempts to produce vacancies or `` holes '' by reducing the magnetic field , with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the hole energy in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
