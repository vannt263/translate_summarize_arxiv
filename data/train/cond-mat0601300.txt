    "recently , there has been a great effort to understand intrinsic phases of a doped mott insulator in the context of high temperature superconductors .",

    "@xcite in particular , the clear evidence of a nematic liquid phase has been reported in two - dimensional electron gases in magnetic fields in ultra - clean samples.@xcite the observed strong anisotropy of longitudinal resistivity has been explained by the onset of a nematic phase at low temperatures . a recent theoretical study of the nematic phase using a quadrupolar interaction , @xmath7 , has offered non - fermi liquid behavior in the nematic phase as well as near the quantum critical point.@xcite this is originated from large fluctuations of the overdamped collective modes within the rpa theory . a non - perturbative approach using higher dimensional bosonization reproduced the quantum critical behavior with the dynamical exponent of @xmath8 , and verified the non - fermi liquid behavior in the nematic phase .",
    "@xcite    however , it was shown that the nature of phase transition of the model with the quadrupolar interaction is quite different when we take into account an underlying square lattice.@xcite on a lattice , a nematic phase can be achieved via a spontaneously broken point - group symmetry due to interactions between electrons .",
