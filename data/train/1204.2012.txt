    "our main object of interest is the function @xmath3 , defined as [ def_q ] q(x):=_n1 ( ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the above series converges for all @xmath8 and that @xmath3 is an odd entire function of exponential type one .",
    "this function was named  flett s function \" by van de lune @xcite and dring @xcite , however later it was given the name  hardy - littlewood \" function by alzer et .",
    "@xcite and gautschi @xcite , and we will follow the latter convention in our paper .    the function @xmath3 was originally introduced in 1936 by hardy and littlewood @xcite , who have used it to construct a certain counter - example in their investigations of lambert summability . in particular , hardy and littlewood have established that @xmath9 , which is just a short notation for _ x+ q(x)/ > 0 .",
    "hardy and littlewood also note that the  o - problems \" for @xmath3 are much like the corresponding problems for the riemann zeta function @xmath10 on the vertical line @xmath11 ( note that it is known that @xmath12 , see theorem 8.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that this similarity in the behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath13 is the main reason why @xmath3 has attracted so much attention after the work of hardy and littlewood .",
    "flett @xcite has proved that @xmath14 and that the same estimate is true for @xmath13 .",
    "segal @xcite has discovered many interesting properties of @xmath3 , such as the following identity [ identity_bessel_functions ] _ 0^y",
    "q(x ) x= 2_n1 ( ) ^2 = - + _ m1 ( ) ^ j_1 ( 2 ) , where @xmath15 is the bessel function of order one , see @xcite . as an application of",
    ", segal proves that the cesro , abel and borel means of @xmath3 are all equal @xmath16 .",
    "codec @xcite has studied oscillation and almost periodicity properties of @xmath3 and some other related functions .",
    "he also makes an important observation that @xmath3 is very similar to some functions which appear as error terms in the estimation of the mean of certain number - theoretic functions .",
    "for example , if we define a  divisor function \" @xmath17 and @xmath18 , then it is known ( see @xcite , p. 100 ) that [ def_s_minus1 ] s_-1(x)=x - ( x)-_nx ( ) + o(1 ) , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the fractional part of @xmath5 . note that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are periodic functions , which means that the two functions @xmath3 and @xmath23 should have many similar properties .",
    "this turns out to be a beneficial way of looking at these functions : among many other results in @xcite , codec has proved that both @xmath3 and @xmath24 are @xmath25 almost periodic function and are unbounded from above and below .",
    "codec also mentiones that delange @xcite has extended the results by hardy and littlewood @xcite and by flett @xcite and has proved that [ omega_theorem ] q(x)= _ ( ) , q(x)=o(((x))^ ) , x+ .",
    "again , the latter result should be compared with the best known bounds @xmath26 ( see @xcite , p. 88 ) and @xmath27 ( see formula 6.19.2 in @xcite ) . the study initiated by codec",

    "finally , we would like to mention the paper @xcite by gautschi , which was the main inspiration for our current work .",
    "gautschi has developed two algorithms for computing @xmath3 numerically : the first algorithm is based on the summation by quadrature and the second ( more efficient ) algorithm is based on truncating the series in at @xmath35 ( the integer part of @xmath5 ) and approximating the tail of this series .",
    "it is clear that this algorithm requires @xmath36 arithmetic operations in order to obtain a single value of @xmath3 , thus it becomes impractical if @xmath5 is very large .",
    "our main results in this paper are several new asymptotic approximations for @xmath3 .",
    "our first result gives an approximation for @xmath3 , which is extremely accurate in the domain @xmath37 and which requires only @xmath38 arithmetic operations .",
