    "the problem of acceleration in physical systems driven by time - periodic external forces , both in classical and quantum mechanics , has a rather long history though the results in the latter case are much less complete .",
    "one of the most prominent examples which initiated a lot of efforts in this field is the so called fermi accelerator . on the basis of a theory due to fermi to explain the acceleration of cosmic rays @xcite ulam formulated a mathematical model describing a massive particle bouncing between two infinitely heavy walls while one of the walls is oscillating @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis finally did not fully confirm the expectations , however @xcite .",
    "the model has also been reformulated in the framework of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "more models of this sort have been studied in detail so far but we just mention one of them , the so called electron cyclotron resonance .",
    "one readily finds that electrons in a uniform magnetic field can gain energy from a microwave electric field whose frequency is equal to the electron cyclotron frequency . because of an unlimited energy increase the relativistic effects",
    "can not be neglected in a complete analysis .",
    "but even the relativistic model admits a quite explicit characterization of the resonant solution for a transverse circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating along the uniform magnetic field @xcite . in experimental arrangements",
    "the heated electrons are confined in a magnetic mirror field .",
    "consequently , as they move along a flux tube of the mirror field they are exposed to the resonance heating only in a restricted region @xcite .",
    "this acceleration mechanism is widely used in plasma physics .    here",
    "we wish to discuss , on the quantum level , a model sharing some features with the preceding one .",
    "we again consider a charged particle placed in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "in our model the situation is simplified , however , in the sense that the particle is confined to a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field . instead of a transverse electromagnetic wave propagating along the uniform field",
    "we apply , as an external force , an oscillating aharonov - bohm flux .",
    "the frequency of oscillations @xmath2 again coincides with the cyclotron frequency @xmath3 or , more generally , it may be an integer multiple of @xmath3 .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect itself received a tremendous attention as a genuinely quantum phenomenon @xcite , and almost all its possible aspects have been studied in the time - independent case .",
    "for example , a careful analysis can be found in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the time - dependent case represents an essentially more difficult mathematical problem and it has been treated so far only marginally in a few papers @xcite .",
    "the model we propose has already been studied in the framework of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a resonance acceleration again exists but it has some remarkable new features if compared to the standard electron cyclotron resonance .",
    "if @xmath2 is an integer multiple of @xmath3 , then the classical trajectory eventually reaches an asymptotic domain where it resembles a spiral whose circles pass very closely to the singular flux line and , at the same time , their radii expand with the rate @xmath4 as @xmath5 approaches infinity .",
    "the particle moves along the circles approximately with frequency @xmath3 while its energy increases linearly with time . denoting by @xmath6 the energy depending on time ,",
    "an important characteristic of the dynamics is the acceleration rate which is computed in @xcite and is given by the formula@xmath7 here @xmath8 is a real number which is expressible in terms of some asymptotic parameters of the trajectory .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to demonstrate that one can derive a formula analogous to ( [ eq : acc_rate_class ] ) also in the framework of quantum mechanics . to this end and because of complexity of the problem , we restrict ourselves to the case when the ab flux depends on time as a sinusoidal function . to this system",
    "we apply the quantum averaging method getting this way an approximate time evolution for which we observe a resonance effect whose principal characterization is again a linear increase of energy .",
    "let us now be more specific .",
    "we consider a quantum point particle of mass @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 moving on the plane in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field of magnitude @xmath11 .",
    "for definiteness , all constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are supposed to be positive . assume further that the particle is driven by an aharonov - bohm magnetic flux concentrated along a line intersecting the plane in the origin and whose strength @xmath12 is oscillating with frequency @xmath2 .    in the time - independent case ,",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to a homogeneous magnetic field and a constant aharonov - bohm flux of magnitude @xmath13 reads@xmath14 where @xmath15 are polar coordinates on the plane , and the hilbert space in question is @xmath16 . making use of the rotational symmetry of the model we restrict ourselves to a fixed eigenspace of the angular momentum @xmath17 with an eigenvalue @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "put @xmath20 then this restriction leads to the radial hamiltonian    @xmath21    in @xmath22 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath23 ( note that @xmath24 is a constant ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at the origin are chosen to be the regular ones ( then @xmath25 is the so called friedrichs self - adjoint extension of the symmetric operator defined on compactly supported smooth functions ) .",
    "let us note that if @xmath26 , then more general boundary conditions are admissible @xcite but here we confine ourselves to the above standard choice .",
    "let @xmath27 be the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the operator @xmath25 has a simple discrete spectrum , the eigenvalues are@xmath28 with the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the normalization constants and @xmath31 are the generalized laguerre polynomials .",
    "thus our main goal is to study the time evolution governed by the periodically time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a @xmath35-periodic continuously differentiable function , @xmath36 is a frequency and @xmath37 is a small parameter .",
    "this means that the aharonov - bohm flux is supposed to depend on time as@xmath38 without loss of generality one can assume that @xmath39 as discussed in @xcite , for the values @xmath26 the domain of @xmath32 in fact depends on @xmath5 , and this feature makes the discussion from the mathematical point of view a bit more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , the time evolution is still guaranteed to exist .",
    "let @xmath40 be the propagator ( evolution operator ) associated with @xmath32 ; it is known to exist @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of the dynamical properties of the system is the time evolution over a period which is described by the floquet ( monodromy ) operator @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the asymptotic behavior of the mean value of energy @xmath43 for an initial condition @xmath44 as @xmath45 tends to infinity while focusing on the resonant case when @xmath46    a basic tool in the study of time - dependent quantum systems is the quasienergy operator @xmath47 acting in the so called extended hilbert space which is , in our case , @xmath48 the time derivative is taken with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this approach , very similar to that usually applied in classical mechanics , makes it possible to pass from a time - dependent system to an autonomous one .",
    "the price to be paid for it is that one has to work with more complex operators on the extended hilbert space .",
    "an important property of the quasienergy consists in its close relationship to the floquet operator @xcite . in more detail ,",
    "if @xmath49 is an eigenfunction or a generalized eigenfunction of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , which also implies that @xmath52 , then the wavefunction @xmath53 solves the schrdinger equation with the initial condition @xmath54 .",
    "it follows that @xmath55 .",
    "thus from the spectral decomposition of the quasienergy one can deduce the spectral decomposition of the floquet operator .    let @xmath56 be the unperturbed quasienergy operator .",
    "its complete set of normalized eigenfunctions is @xmath57 ( here @xmath58 stands for nonnegative integers , the wave functions @xmath59 are defined in ( [ eq : basis_varphi_n ] ) ) , with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath61 has a pure point spectrum which is in the resonant case ( [ eq : resonance ] ) infinitely degenerated .    to take into account these degeneracies",
    "we perform the following transformation of indices .",
    "denote by @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 the integer and the fractional part of a real number @xmath64 , respectively , i.e. @xmath65+\\{x\\}$ ] , @xmath62\\in\\mathbb{z}$ ] and @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath67 be the remainder in division of an integer @xmath68 by @xmath69 .",
    "the transformation of indices is a one - to - one map of @xmath70 onto itself sending @xmath71 to @xmath72 , with @xmath73,\\label{eq : indices_kl_mn}\\ ] ] and , conversely,@xmath74-\\ell,\\ n = n(k,\\ell):=\\mu\\ell+\\rho(\\mu , k).\\label{eq : indices_mn_kl}\\ ] ]    using the new indices @xmath72 we put@xmath75 then the vectors @xmath76 , @xmath77 , form an orthonormal basis in the extended hilbert space @xmath78 . for a fixed integer @xmath79 let @xmath80 be the orthogonal projection onto the subspace in @xmath78 spanned by the vectors @xmath76 , @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82    furthermore , using the basis @xmath83 one can identify @xmath78 with the hilbert space @xmath84 .",
    "in particular , partial differential operators in the variables @xmath5 and @xmath85 like the quasienergy are identified in this way with matrix operators . in the sequel",
    "we denote matrix operators by bold uppercase letters .",
    "the full quasienergy operator @xmath86 depends on the small parameter @xmath37 .",
    "let us write @xmath87 as a formal power series , @xmath88 . in our case,@xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the ultimate goal of the quantum averaging method in the case of resonances is a unitary transformation resulting in a partial ( block - wise ) diagonalization of @xmath87 .",
    "thus one seeks a skew - hermitian operator @xmath91 so that @xmath92 commutes with @xmath61 which is the same as saying that it commutes with all projections @xmath80 .",
    "this goal is achievable in principle through an infinite recurrence which in practice should be interrupted at some step .",
    "here we shall be content with the first order approximation .",
    "let us introduce the block - wise diagonal part of an operator @xmath93 in @xmath78 as @xmath94 thus @xmath95 surely commutes with @xmath61 .",
    "the off - diagonal part is then defined as @xmath96 .",
    "developing formally in @xmath37 one has @xmath97 and@xmath98+o(\\epsilon^{2}).\\ ] ] choosing @xmath99 as @xmath100 one has @xmath101=-{\\mathop\\mathrm{offdiag}\\nolimits}k_{1}\\label{eq : comm_w1_k0}\\ ] ] and @xmath102    let us note that the solution is also expressible in terms of averaging integrals , and this explains the name of the method @xcite . in more detail ,",
    "one has@xmath103 and@xmath104    after switching on the perturbation , any unperturbed eigenvalue @xmath105 gives rise to a perturbed spectrum which , in the first order approximation , equals the spectrum of the operator @xmath106 restricted to the subspace @xmath107 .",
    "if the degeneracy of @xmath105 is infinite then the character of the perturbed spectrum may be arbitrary , depending on the properties of @xmath108 .",
    "the corresponding perturbed ( generalized ) eigenvectors span a subspace which is the range of the orthogonal projection@xmath109+o(\\epsilon^{2})\\\\   & = & p_{k}-\\epsilon\\,(\\hat{s}_{k}k_{1}p_{k}+p_{k}k_{1}\\hat{s}_{k})+o(\\epsilon^{2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath110 is the reduced resolvent of @xmath61 taken at the isolated eigenvalue @xmath105 .",
    "thus the first order averaging method is in fact nothing but the standard quantum perturbation method in the first order but accomplished on the extended hilbert space simultaneously for all eigenvalues of @xmath61 ( compare to ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii2 ) ) .    our strategy in the remainder of the paper is based on replacing the true quasienergy @xmath87 by its first order approximation @xmath111 and , consequently , @xmath41 is replaced by an approximate floquet operator @xmath112 associated with @xmath113 . to determine the approximate floquet operator @xmath112 one has to solve the spectral problem for @xmath113 . to this end , as already pointed out above , one can employ the orthonormal basis @xmath114 in order to identify operators in @xmath78 with infinite matrices indexed by @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath115 denote the standard basis in @xmath116 , and @xmath117 denote the standard basis in @xmath118 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath84 as the tensor product of hilbert spaces @xmath119 which also means identification of the standard basis in @xmath84 with the set of vectors @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the orthogonal projection onto the one - dimensional subspace @xmath122 . recalling ( [ eq : def_k_trunc1 ] ) , ( [ eq : def_k0 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_k1_k2 ] ) , the matrix @xmath123 of the operator @xmath113 expressed in the basis ( [ eq : basis_psi_kl ] ) takes the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the matrix operator in @xmath118 with the entries @xmath126    to compute the matrix entries of @xmath125 one observes that formally ( see ( [ eq : def_h_p]))@xmath127 and so@xmath128(\\ell_{2}-\\ell_{1})\\,\\left\\langle \\varphi_{n(k,\\ell_{1})}(p),\\left(\\partial h(p)/\\partial p\\right)\\varphi_{n(k,\\ell_{2})}(p)\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath129(j)=(2\\pi)^{-1}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}e^{-ij\\cdot s}f(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\ ] ] stands for the @xmath130th fourier coefficient of @xmath131 .",

    "then @xmath150 decomposes into the orthogonal sum @xmath151 and from the relationship between @xmath113 and @xmath112 , as recalled in section  [ sec : floquet_quasienergy ] , it follows that every subspace @xmath147 is invariant with respect to @xmath112 .    in the example",
    "which we study in more detail in the following section ( for a sinusoidal function @xmath34 ) , the matrix operators @xmath152 have purely absolutely continuous spectra . for the sake of simplicity of the notation",

    "thus the spectral decomposition of @xmath152 reads:@xmath162    put @xmath163 then again,@xmath164 and , for all @xmath165,@xmath166    to get a correct approximation in the first order of the propagator one further has to take into account the transformation which is inverse to that generated by @xmath167@xmath168 .",

    "too , the normalization constant is given by @xmath257    as already mentioned , the phase @xmath238 in the asymptotic solution ( [ eq : xi_j_asympt ] ) remains undetermined .",

    "the sum in ( [ eq : h_th1_th2 ] ) can be evaluated analogously as that in ( [ eq : sum_eq_pi_delta ] ) with the result@xmath284 estimating the acceleration rate we can restrict ourselves to a sufficiently small but fixed neighborhood of the diagonal with a radius @xmath285 .",
    "thus we arrive at the expression @xmath286 further we carry out the differentiation , as indicated in the integrand , and get rid of the terms which are not proportional to @xmath45 or which are non - singular .",
    "moreover , we use the substitution @xmath287 .",
    "thus we obtain the expression@xmath288 finally note that , for any @xmath254 real , @xmath289    suppose that the initial state is chosen as @xmath290 .",
    "then we conclude that the formula for the acceleration rate in the first - order approximation reads@xmath291 here we have used that @xmath292    formula ( [ eq : acc_rate_quant ] ) can be compared to formula ( [ eq : acc_rate_class ] ) , as derived for a classical particle , in the case when @xmath12 is given by ( [ eq : phi_t ] ) and @xmath195 .",
    "then ( [ eq : acc_rate_class ] ) gives the acceleration rate @xmath293 where @xmath294 depends on some data which can be learned from the asymptotic behavior of the classical trajectory .",
    "let us finally note that , according to the analysis and discussion of the classical case presented in @xcite , the first - order averaging approximation may in fact yield the correct acceleration rate ( valid for the original system ) , and this is so even if the parameter @xmath37 is not necessarily assumed to be very small .",
    "we conclude our discussion by a presentation of a numerical result that agree quite nicely with the predicted acceleration rate ( [ eq : acc_rate_quant ] ) . for the sake of simplicity we put @xmath295 , and so @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "we still assume that @xmath195 . concerning the physical constants , we set @xmath298 , @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "furthermore , we choose @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and for the density @xmath303 determining an initial state according to ( [ eq : varphi_int_varrho ] ) we take the gaussian function@xmath304 restricted to the interval @xmath305 .",
    "its values near the limit points of the interval are in fact numerically indistinguishable from @xmath258 .",
    "particularly , @xmath303 is normalized to unity with a negligible error , i.e.@xmath306    the numerical method we use is based on expanding a solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation with respect to the time - dependent basis @xmath307 , with @xmath308 being defined in ( [ eq : basis_varphi_n ] ) .",
    "below we call the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath309 . recalling ( [ eq : xi_th_r_def ] ) we put @xmath310 and we have @xmath311 . the task is to solve the cauchy problem for the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath312 let us note that in the case of @xmath195 the matrix entries of @xmath313 are expressed as the finite sum@xmath314 with @xmath315 being given in ( [ eq : w_jn1n2 ] ) ( with @xmath296 ) .",
    "to carry out the computations we truncate the fourier expansion of @xmath309 , @xmath316 at some fixed order @xmath317 . in this way",
    "we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations for the fourier coefficients @xmath318 explicit formulas for the scalar products are known from @xcite ( see ( [ eq : scalar_varphi_der_psi ] ) ) . in order to approximately solve this system",
    "we employ the explicit runge - kutta method of order 4 ( rk4 ) with an adaptive step - size control , and we choose @xmath319 .    from the computational point of view",
    "it is convenient to introduce the mean value of energy at time @xmath5 as @xmath320 @xmath6",
    "is then approximated by the sum@xmath321 the acceleration rate is computed according to formula ( [ eq : acc_rate_quant ] ) in which one has to substitute @xmath262 for @xmath44 .",
    "let us point out that this formula depends only on the time evolution over the intervals which are integer multiples of the period @xmath172 , and clearly , @xmath322 for @xmath323 .",
    "the predicted acceleration rate for the above particular values of parameters is @xmath324 .",
    "the numerically computed function @xmath325 is compared to this value in fig .  1 .",
    "here we compute the derivative @xmath260 of the phase @xmath238 introduced in ( [ eq : xi_j_asympt ] ) . we know that @xmath258 always belongs to the spectrum of the jacobi matrix @xmath200 introduced in ( [ eq : j ] ) . putting @xmath217 , with @xmath326 and@xmath327 for @xmath149 , one has @xmath328 and @xmath218 . recalling that",
    ", in our example , @xmath329 one derives that @xmath330 where @xmath331 is a finite constant ( depending on @xmath139 , however ) . comparing to ( [ eq : xi_j_asympt ] ) , with @xmath280 and @xmath259",
    ", one finds that @xmath332 moreover , @xmath333 .",
    "differentiating the equality @xmath334 with respect to @xmath227 at the point @xmath335 and using the substitution@xmath336 with @xmath337 , one arrives at the equation @xmath338 . from ( [ eq : xi_j_asympt ] ) one deduces that@xmath339 for @xmath236 .",
    "this suggests that one can seek a solution @xmath340 such that @xmath341 for all @xmath130 .",
    "this assumption on @xmath340 is in fact necessary and makes the solution unambiguous since otherwise one could add to @xmath340 any nonzero multiple of @xmath225 thus violating the asymptotic behavior ( [ eq : v_j_asympt ] ) .",
    "given that all odd elements of the vector @xmath225 and all even elements of @xmath340 vanish the equation @xmath338 effectively reduces to a linear system with a lower triangular matrix which is explicitly solvable .",
