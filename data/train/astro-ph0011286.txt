    "cool white dwarfs have recently gained attention due to the discovery of faint ( @xmath9 ) objects in the hubble deep field survey ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) which have been interpreted by @xcite as being cool ( @xmath10  k ) and old ( @xmath11 gyr ) hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs .",
    "hansen has shown that the location of these objects _ blueward _ of the white dwarf cooling sequence in the @xmath12  vs @xmath13 color - magnitude diagram is the result of the extremely strong h@xmath5  molecular absorption features which extend well into the optical regions of their energy distributions . hence ,",
    "even though hydrogen - rich white dwarfs become redder with decreasing effective temperature down to @xmath14  k ( see , e.g. , fig .  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even cooler stars actually become bluer .",
    "note that the most recent photometric and spectroscopic analysis of cool white dwarfs in the local galactic disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter brl ) has shown no evidence of white dwarfs cooler than 4000  k.    in addition , @xcite has also discussed the importance of using detailed stellar atmospheres as boundary conditions for calculating cooling white dwarf models .",
    "for instance , the cooling age of a 0.6 @xmath6 , @xmath15  k white dwarf can differ by @xmath16 gyr depending on whether the object has a hydrogen- or a helium - dominated atmosphere . given this sensitivity ,",
    "it is important to determine precisely the atmospheric composition of cool white dwarfs before any attempt to determine their age is made .    to complicate things even more",
    ", white dwarfs are not expected to preserve their hydrogen or helium atmospheric signature throughout their evolution .",
    "indeed , there is both theoretical and observational evidence which indicates that the chemical composition of white dwarfs is likely to change many times during their lifetime due to competing mechanisms ( e.g. , gravitational settling , convective mixing , convective dredge - up , accretion from the interstellar medium , radiative acceleration ) which may affect the composition of the outer layers of these stars as they cool ( see * ? ? ? * for a review on the subject ) .",
    "this is even more important for cool white dwarfs where convective mixing of a thin ( @xmath17 ) hydrogen atmosphere with the more massive convective helium envelope can turn a hydrogen - rich atmosphere into a helium - dominated atmosphere anywhere between 12,000  k and 5000  k. the exact temperature at which convective mixing occurs  or whether it will occur at all  depends on the thickness of the hydrogen layer ( the thicker the hydrogen layer , the cooler the mixing temperature ) .",
    "furthermore , brl have clearly demonstrated that the chemical evolution of cool white dwarfs is even more complex than previously anticipated , and that several mechanisms  some of them still unknown  are at play to alter the chemical constituent of their atmospheres as they cool .",
    "consequently , the age of any cool white dwarf is not only strongly dependent on its atmospheric composition , as pointed out by @xcite , _ but also on its chemical evolution history_. for instance , a recently mixed helium - rich atmosphere white dwarf would have an integrated cooling age of its immediate predecessor  i.e.  that of a hydrogen - rich atmosphere white dwarf .",
    "stellar ages and chemical evolution can thus not be easily disentangled .",
    "this unfortunate consequence stresses the importance of better understanding the chemical evolution of cool white dwarf stars .    for several years",
    "now , we have been pursuing our comprehensive investigation of cool white dwarf evolution .",
    "we presented in brl photometric and spectroscopic observations of 110 cool white dwarfs , and analyzed them with model atmosphere calculations appropriate for cool white dwarfs with pure hydrogen and pure helium compositions , as well as with mixed h / he compositions .",
    "our fitting technique consists of comparing the observed energy distributions in the optical @xmath1 and infrared @xmath2 with those predicted from model atmospheres in order to determine the effective temperature of the star .",
    "when available , trigonometric parallax measurements are used to derive the radius of the star , and hence the mass through the mass - radius relation for white dwarfs . finally , high signal - to - noise spectroscopy at h@xmath3is used to determine , or at least constrain , the chemical composition of their atmospheres .",
    "the main results of the brl analysis are summarized here together with our current understanding of the physical models which have been proposed to account for the observations .",
    "most cool white dwarfs have energy distributions which are consistent with either pure hydrogen or pure helium atmospheric compositions , with little evidence for objects with mixed h / he compositions . in general , the energy distributions of da ( hydrogen - line ) stars are consistent with pure hydrogen atmospheres , while those of non - da stars are consistent with pure helium atmospheres .",
    "exceptions include a few extremely cool non - da stars with hydrogen - dominated atmospheres which are simply too cool to exhibit any hydrogen absorption features , the so - called c@xmath5h stars whose peculiar energy distributions and strong molecular absorption bands have been interpreted as the result of mixed h / he / c compositions with @xmath18 @xcite , and a few other objects which are most likely unresolved binaries ( see brl and references therein ) . note that hydrogen lines are observed in da stars as cool as @xmath19  k , that is , almost at the end of the observable white dwarf cooling sequence of the local galactic disk .",
    "brl have also shown that the temperature distribution of da and non - da stars is not homogeneous .",
    "in particular , even though non - da stars are abundant above @xmath20  k , most white dwarfs below this temperature , down to @xmath15  k , are of the da type ( the so - called `` non - da gap '' ) . moreover , brl have identified a group of objects which lie close to , and above , @xmath20  k whose energy distributions are better reproduced with pure hydrogen models , even though their optical spectra are completely featureless ; hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs in this particular range of temperature should exhibit strong hydrogen lines .",
    "brl proposed an exotic model to account for both the strange nature of these objects and the existence of the non - da gap .",
    "a warmer , pure helium atmosphere white dwarf slowly accretes hydrogen from the interstellar medium as it cools .",
    "most atomic levels of the hydrogen accreted are quenched as a result of the high atmospheric pressures which characterize cool , helium - rich atmospheres .",
    "in particular , the bound level of @xmath21  is destroyed , and the corresponding bound - free @xmath21  opacity  the most important opacity source in hydrogen - rich atmospheres  is significantly reduced .",
    "consequently , the accretion of hydrogen onto a helium - dominated atmosphere would have little effect on the opacity and thus on the atmospheric pressure .",
    "brl proposed that large amounts of hydrogen could be _ hidden _ through this simple accretion / quenching mechanism .",
    "they also suggested that at some point , the free - free @xmath21  opacity would become large enough for the atmospheric pressure to drop below the threshold value at which the @xmath21  ion starts to recombine .",
    "the star then rapidly turns into a normal hydrogen - rich white dwarf .",
    "brl suggested that the group of peculiar white dwarfs discussed above could represent such objects with a mixture of helium and quenched hydrogen , in the process of turning into normal da stars , and that the non - da gap could be accounted for by the sudden transformation of apparently helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs into hydrogen - dominated atmospheres .",
    "more recently , @xcite have explored more quantitatively the model proposed by brl .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that the accretion of even minute amounts of hydrogen onto a helium - dominated atmosphere , @xmath22 , provide enough free electrons  through the thermal ionization of hydrogen  to increase the he@xmath23 opacity significantly , which in turn , reduces the atmospheric pressure below which quenching effects on hydrogen become negligible .",
    "the presence of hydrogen therefore has an _ indirect _ effect on the total opacity through the free electrons it provides to the plasma . on the basis of their analysis",
    ", @xcite rejected the model proposed by brl .",
    "given these results , the nature of the peculiar objects identified by brl and the existence of the non - da gap remain unexplained .",
    "@xcite provided an alternative explanation for the non - da gap .",
    "the gap is evident in his figure 13 even though he restricted his sample of objects to that of @xcite rather than using the more complete sample studied by brl , where the gap is even more obvious .",
    "hansen has shown that the concentration of non - da stars just below @xmath15  k have nearly the same age as the concentration of da stars around 6000  k. on the basis of this conclusion alone , hansen suggested that the non - da gap alluded to by brl is only a result of the difference of cooling timescales between hydrogen - dominated and helium - dominated atmospheres . however",
    ", this interpretation can not be correct since it neglects the fact that non - da stars are also observed in large numbers _ above _ the gap at @xmath24  k. in other words , non - da stars are seen both above and below the gap , and the high - temperature end of the gap does not reflect a simple termination of the cooling sequence of degenerates with helium - dominated atmospheres . unless helium - rich white dwarfs evolve more rapidly _ through _ the gap than above or below the gap , which is not the case , an explanation based solely on differences in cooling rates does not hold .",
    "obviously , a chemical evolution from one spectral type to another must be invoked .",
    "other results from the brl analysis support the idea that some physical mechanism , yet unidentified , is at play near the blue edge of the non - da gap .",
    "for instance , the most widely accepted explanation for the presence of carbon in the photospheric layers of dq stars is that carbon is convectively dredged - up from the core , as demonstrated quantitatively by @xcite .",
    "these calculations show that the extent of the carbon diffusion tail is reduced at low effective temperature due to the partial recombination of carbon , and smaller carbon abundances are predicted in dq stars with lower effective temperature , in apparent agreement with the observations ( see fig .  4 of * ?",
    "as pointed out by brl , however , the coolest dq stars have the strongest observed c@xmath5 molecular bands , and cooler objects with even smaller abundances are well within the observational limits and should be easily detectable .",
    "the brl analysis has revealed instead the existence of an abrupt cutoff in effective temperature at @xmath25  k below which dq stars are no longer found .",
    "the presence of carbon in stars below this temperature threshold is in the form of what has been interpreted as c@xmath5h molecular bands by @xcite .",
    "the most obvious explanation proposed by brl is that dq stars turn into c@xmath5h stars below @xmath26  k. the mechanism proposed by brl by which the hydrogen required to form the c@xmath5h molecule suddenly appears in these objects relies on their composition transition model , which was later discarded by @xcite .",
    "hence , even though the dq to c@xmath5h transition remains the most likely explanation for the existence of the abrupt cutoff of the dq star phenomenon , the physical mechanism by which this transition occurs needs further investigation .",
    "brl have also shown that below the non - da gap near @xmath15  k , non - da stars reappear in large number .",
    "the most likely explanation for this phenomenon is the convective mixing of the relatively thin surface hydrogen layer with the deeper and more massive helium envelope .",
    "detailed envelope calculations indicate that the bottom of the hydrogen convection layer reaches its deepest point at a certain temperature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; white dwarfs with hydrogen layers thicker than this maximum depth point can never mix and will remain hydrogen - rich forever .",
    "the canonical value of the lowest possible mixing temperature is @xmath27  k , which corresponds to a hydrogen layer mass of @xmath28 .",
    "this is @xmath29  k hotter than the temperature required to account for the brl observations .",
    "new envelope models discussed by brl which include realistic model atmospheres as boundary conditions reduce the mixing temperature limit well down to 5000  k , however .",
    "hence , convective mixing may well represent the correct interpretation for the reappearance of non - da stars below the non - da gap .",
    "the continued presence of da stars requires that at least some stars have hydrogen layers thicker than @xmath28 .    following the brl analysis ,",
    "@xcite have gathered new photometric and spectroscopic data for the 43 cool , low - luminosity , high  proper - motion white dwarfs in the @xcite sample .",
    "this sample was analyzed with the techniques developed by brl in order to improve the determination of the cool white dwarf luminosity function and the estimate of the age of the local galactic disk .",
    "brl discuss at length the shortcomings of the previous estimates by @xcite , and in particular the lack of precise atmospheric parameter determinations as well as accurate bolometric corrections for the stars in the sample . the improved luminosity function of @xcite yields an age of the local region of the galactic disk of @xmath30 gyr , with the uncertainty being mainly due to the core composition , the effect of separation on crystallization , and the unknown mass of the outer helium envelope .",
    "the @xcite sample is being extended to a lower proper - motion limit and a new luminosity function is being determined which supports the earlier work @xcite .    as mentioned in brl ,",
    "these earlier efforts represent only the first step towards a better understanding of the chemical evolution of cool white dwarfs .",
    "even though the brl analysis has provided us with a wealth of new observational and theoretical results , many questions have remained unanswered , and the problems to be solved have multiplied .",
    "the success of our analysis has prompted us to extend our study to a larger and more complete sample of cool white dwarfs .",
    "we thus present in this paper a detailed analysis of all cool ( @xmath0  k ) white dwarfs with trigonometric parallax measurements available to us .",
    "such measurements are of particular importance to derive stellar radii , and hence stellar masses .",
    "this new sample is comprised of 152 white dwarfs for which masses can be derived .",
    "in contrast , only 67 out of the 110 white dwarfs analyzed by brl had trigonometric parallax measurements .",
    "furthermore , brl concentrated their effort towards cool ( @xmath31  k ) , non - da white dwarfs , while our new sample is distributed over a wider range of effective temperature and spectral types .    in   2 ,",
    "we discuss the improvements in the model atmospheres and cooling models since our most recent analysis . in   3 , we present our new photometric and spectroscopic observations , which , combined with our earlier observations , are analyzed in   4 .",
    "the global properties of our sample are examined in   5 .",
    "our conclusions follow in   6 .",
    "the model atmospheres used in this analysis are described at length in @xcite , and improvements to these models are discussed in brl and below .",
    "these models are appropriate for cool white dwarfs with pure hydrogen or pure helium atmospheres , as well as mixed h / he compositions .",
    "our current model grid now includes self - consistently the @xmath32 ion in the ionization equilibrium calculations . as discussed in detail by @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath32 ion was treated as a trace element in our earlier calculations .",
    "although this assumption is valid in terms of the number of particles , @xmath33 , the presence of the @xmath32 ion affects the ionization equilibrium significantly for temperatures below @xmath34  k. in cool , pure helium ( or helium - rich ) models , the electron density is governed by he@xmath35 , rather than he@xmath36 ( or @xmath21 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , despite the fact that the continuous absorption opacity of he@xmath35 is negligible at low temperatures , the inclusion of this ion in model atmospheres has repercussion on the he@xmath23 free - free opacity  the dominant opacity source in helium - rich models  through its effect on the electron density .",
    "the occupation probability of @xcite for the calculation of the hydrogen populations has also been included more accurately in our current model grid following the work of @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows us to calculate cool white dwarf models with arbitrarily low hydrogen abundances .",
    "indeed , the photospheric pressures which characterize low hydrogen abundance atmospheres are so high that the hydrogen atomic levels ( including that of the @xmath21  ion ) are strongly perturbed . in the most extreme cases ,",
    "pressure ionization of hydrogen may even occur ( we note that even though the pressure ionization model used in the hummer - mihalas formalism is very crude , it is sufficient for our current needs ) . since the hummer - mihalas formalism had not been included in our earlier investigations , brl were unable to compute cool models with @xmath37 ( see   5.3 of brl ) .",
    "we note that the nonideal effects included in the equation - of - state of our pure helium model grid ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) are neglected in the mixed h / he models .",
    "our latest hydrogen ( and mixed hydrogen / helium ) models include the new h@xmath5  collision - induced opacity calculations of @xcite , as well as the additional term discussed by @xcite which takes into account collisions involving three h@xmath5  molecules .",
    "our hydrogen model grid has also been extended to @xmath38  k , the coolest models calculated by @xcite .",
    "the non - ideal effects in the equation - of - state introduced by saumon and jacobson are neglected here , however .",
    "a more detailed discussion of these cooler models will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the hydrogen and mixed hydrogen / helium models have been calculated with the so - called ml2/@xmath39 parameterization of the mixing - length theory ( as opposed to the ml1 calibration used in brl ) , following the suggestion of @xcite from their analysis of zz ceti stars .",
    "although this will not affect the atmospheric parameter determinations of the cooler objects in our sample ( @xmath40  k ) , the emergent energy distributions of warmer models are quite sensitive to the convective efficiency used in the calculations , as shown by @xcite .",
    "we note finally that this new model grid has not changed significantly the quality of the fits shown in brl , or the determination of the atmospheric parameters from our previous analyses .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the importance of including metals in the atmospheres of cool , helium - rich white dwarfs .",
    "their results indicate that the model atmospheres and predicted energy distributions are quite sensitive to the presence of additional elements .",
    "they also claim that their improved models reproduce the scatter observed in two - color diagrams better than the models used in brl .",
    "here , we present our own assessment of this problem . a more complete appraisal of the jrgensen et al .",
    "results will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the main effect of including heavy elements in the model atmospheres of cool , helium - rich white dwarfs is to increase the number of free electrons in the plasma , which in turn affect the he@xmath23 free - free opacity considerably . as mentioned by @xcite , more than 99% of the electrons may come from metals which have a relatively low ionization potential . as an experiment",
    ", we calculated a pure helium model at @xmath41  k , @xmath42 , but with an electron density artificially increased by a factor of 1000 ( only 0.1% of the electrons come from helium directly , i.e. the value quoted by jrgensen et al . ) .",
    "the temperature and pressure structures of this model are compared in figure [ fg : comp_tp ] with those of a standard pure helium model . as can be seen ,",
    "the temperature structure of the upper layers has changed significantly , but that of the deeper layers where the _ continuum is formed _",
    "( @xmath43 ) has remained relatively unaffected .",
    "the gas pressure , on the other hand , has been reduced quite dramatically throughout the atmosphere as a result of the increase in the opacity ( @xmath44 ) , which in this case is dominated by the he@xmath23 free - free opacity .",
    "perhaps of greater interest is the comparison of the predicted fluxes from these two models , displayed in figure [ fg : compflux ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the results indicate that the observed differences are small .",
    "the reason for this is that in the pure helium model , the he@xmath23 free - free opacity already dominates at all wavelengths where the continuum is formed .",
    "an increase in the electron density thus increases the opacity by the same factor _ at all wavelengths_. consequently , the emergent flux can not be redistributed any differently .",
    "the small differences observed in figure [ fg : compflux ] can be measured more quantitatively by fitting our test model with our pure helium grid .",
    "we find that the predicted energy distribution of our test model can be fit to better than 1% at all wavelengths with our pure helium grid at @xmath45  k. we thus conclude that the presence of metals in helium - rich models does not affect significantly the atmospheric parameters derived in the brl analysis and in this analysis .",
    "note that the presence of metallic lines or molecular absorption features may affect the predicted broadband fluxes , but we do not believe that they can affect the model structure significantly , with the exception of the most extreme cases such as those discussed in   [ sbsc : optir ] .",
    "there are several reasons why the conclusions of @xcite are different from those reached here .",
    "first they state that white dwarfs are `` carbon rich '' .",
    "this is simply not true as only a small fraction of cool non - da stars exhibit carbon features .",
    "it is also a well known observational fact that the presence of carbon and metallic features are mutually exclusive ( for reasons still unknown ) .",
    "the authors have also shown in their figure 3 that the inclusion of molecules in their model produces a substantial heating at all layers . however ,",
    "this statement is somewhat misleading since their plot shows the temperature profile as a function of gas pressure , and as these two parameters are not independent in a model atmosphere , it is not possible from such a plot to determine which of the parameters ( temperature or gas pressure ) has in fact changed .",
    "a more appropriate independent parameter is the rosseland mean optical depth , as used here in figure [ fg : comp_tp ] .",
    "jrgensen et al .",
    "also claim that the new h@xmath5-he collision - induced opacity they have calculated  and not used in our own model calculations  has a significant influence on the predicted emergent fluxes .",
    "however , their figure 6 shows instead that the differences are actually quite small at the @xmath46 values considered here , and not pertinent to the present discussion .",
    "more importantly , they have assumed a non - zero hydrogen abundance of @xmath47 on the basis of either old studies , or analyses of objects that do show direct or indirect traces of hydrogen ( e.g. , ross 640 , lhs 1126 ) .",
    "traces of hydrogen in these cool models produce a strong infrared flux deficiency ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) which is simply not observed in cool non - da stars studied by us ( brl and this analysis ) , with the glaring exception of lhs 1126 @xcite near @xmath48  k whose infrared flux deficiency has been attributed to the h@xmath5-he molecular opacity .",
    "surprisingly enough , @xcite conclude that at this particular temperature , the h@xmath5-he opacity has little effect .",
    "this is because they have considered hydrogen abundances which are way too small in this case  lhs 1126 has @xmath49 .",
    "the claim by jrgensen et al .  that the predicted energy distribution is not sensitive to the helium - to - hydrogen abundance ratio is thus also inaccurate .",
    "their figures 8 and 9 show their helium - rich models , as well as some of their hydrogen - rich models , in a ( @xmath50@xmath51 , @xmath51@xmath52 ) two - color diagram , together with the brl observations .",
    "also shown for comparison are the hydrogen - rich and helium - rich models used in brl .",
    "the authors conclude that both their hydrogen - rich and helium - rich models reproduce the observed photometric data better than the models used in brl . however , the authors failed to distinguish the da and non - da stars in their figures , as was carefully done in figure 9 of brl .",
    "a more careful examination of both results indicates that their helium - rich models actually fail to match the non - da stars close to @xmath50@xmath53 , @xmath51@xmath54 altogether , while our pure helium models go straight through the observed data .",
    "their figure 8 shows instead that their helium - rich models reproduce nicely the sequence of _ da stars _ which have hydrogen - rich atmospheres .",
    "the authors also claim that at the warm end of the observed sequence , their models `` follow better the tendency of a linear observed sequence that the observations indicate , than do the brl models which diverge toward higher values of @xmath50@xmath51 '' .",
    "again , the authors failed to realize that the warm end of the sequence in brl is composed exclusively of non - da stars .",
    "the fact is that da stars _ do diverge _ toward higher values of @xmath50@xmath51 , as do the models ( see our figure [ fg : bmv : vmk ] below ) .",
    "if anything , their hydrogen - rich models fail to reproduce the warm end of the observed da sequence .",
    "finally and more importantly , @xcite claim that their helium - rich models reproduce the scatter in the observational data seen at the cool end of diagram better than do the brl models which follow an almost straight line .",
    "first of all , most of the observed scatter is due to the fact that the coolest objects include _ both hydrogen - rich and helium - rich white dwarfs_. indeed , when one considers only the helium - rich stars ( the filled circles in the right panel of fig .",
    "9 of brl ) , they do form an almost straight line , as opposed to the jrgensen et al .",
    "second , these authors show that their models can reproduce the entire cool end of the diagram by changing the c / o ratio .",
    "this is again somewhat misleading .",
    "indeed , the observed `` hook '' in their predicted colors is entirely due to the h@xmath5-he collision - induced opacity .",
    "similar hooks can be observed in the brl models as well , whether they are due to h@xmath5-h@xmath5  or h@xmath5-he molecular opacities ( see fig .",
    "9 of brl ) .",
    "since these collision - induced opacities are strongly dependent on the atmospheric pressure , the predicted colors will be sensitive to surface gravity ( see the hydrogen sequences with various values of @xmath55 in fig .",
    "9 of brl , middle panel ) , or to the hydrogen - to - helium abundance ( see the helium - rich sequences with various values of @xmath56 in fig .  9 of brl , right panel ) .",
    "the results shown in figure 8 of @xcite simply reflect a change in the opacity , and thus atmospheric pressure , due to a change in the electron density for various values of c / o .",
    "more problematic is the effective temperature near 3000  k inferred from figures 8 and 9 of @xcite for the bulk of the coolest white dwarfs . at this temperature ,",
    "the predicted energy distribution shows a strong infrared flux deficiency which is simply not observed in these objects , as discussed above .",
    "this is the danger of interpreting cool white dwarfs in two - color diagrams only , and in particular the ( @xmath50@xmath51 , @xmath51@xmath52 ) diagram ( see   5.2.2 of brl ) , rather than fitting the entire energy distribution , which is the technique favored by brl and in this analysis .      in order to derive stellar masses from the measured radii , and to determine cooling ages",
    ", we must rely on detailed evolutionary models .",
    "in brl , we made use of the models of @xcite for the pure helium and mixed hydrogen / helium compositions , and those of @xcite for the pure hydrogen models .",
    "the former models have carbon - core compositions , helium layers of @xmath57 , and no hydrogen layers , while the latter have carbon - core compositions as well , but helium layers of @xmath58 , and thick hydrogen layers of @xmath59 .    in this paper",
    ", we use instead two families of new evolutionary models kindly computed for us by g. fontaine who used the new evolutionary code developed by p. brassard at universit de montral on the basis of finite - element techniques . while details of that code will be described elsewhere @xcite , a few remarks about it are worthy of interest .",
    "the code is especially designed to follow in a robust and efficient way moving discontinuities in a cooling white dwarf model , namely , the top and base of superficial convection zones , and the advancing crystallization front in the core and in the envelope .",
    "the full structure of a model , from the center to the top of the atmosphere ( typically located at @xmath60 = @xmath61 ) , is included in the evolutionary calculations . upgraded input physics , including the new model atmospheres described above , has been incorporated in the code in order to be able to compute realistic white dwarf models reaching the regime of very low effective temperatures that is of interest for discussing white dwarf populations in the halo and in old globular clusters .",
    "the first family of evolutionary structures that we use are standard `` thick envelope '' stellar models with a helium mantle of @xmath62 , and an outermost hydrogen layer of @xmath59 .",
    "the core of these models consists of a uniform mixture of carbon and oxygen in equal proportions ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "no sedimentation between carbon and oxygen upon crystallization has been taken into account in these models .",
    "sedimentation would add a small delay to the cooling age , but would not change the mass - radius relation in any significant way . on the other hand , the effects of convective feedback on the position of the hydrogen convection zone have been taken into account in the calculations .",
    "likewise , neutrino cooling has been included in a routine way , but this only affects the evolution in the high luminosity phases only , as is well known .",
    "no residual thermonuclear burning has been included in order to keep the same value of the fractional mass of the outer hydrogen layer in all models .",
    "finally , 16 different masses in the range 0.21.3 @xmath6  have been considered .",
    "the second family of models ( with again 16 different sequences ) is similar to the first one , except for the assumed stratification of the envelope .",
    "this second batch of structures are now `` thin envelope '' stellar models with a helium mantle of @xmath58 as before , but with an outermost hydrogen layer of only @xmath64 .",
    "no convective mixing between the hydrogen and helium layers is allowed in these models .",
    "we picked this particular stratification as representative of `` thin '' hydrogen envelope models .",
    "the small layer of hydrogen atop these models does not change in any significant way the mass - radius relation for the cooler models that are of interest here . from that point of view",
    ", that same mass - radius relation can thus be used for non - da stars .",
    "evolutionary calculations of helium - rich atmospheres can also be carried out , but the cooling times show an extreme sensitivity to the presence of even very small traces of heavy elements in the atmosphere / envelope , leading to a continuum of ages , hence we adopted the current strategy .",
    "in the brl study , 110 genuine cool white dwarfs were selected on the basis of their spectral type classification from the catalog of @xcite , from a proper - motion survey in the southern hemisphere @xcite , and from the study of @xcite .",
    "this first sample was strongly biased against da stars in order to determine whether true dc stars existed , and if they did , what was their atmospheric composition .",
    "our high signal - to - noise spectroscopy actually revealed the presence of h@xmath3  in 20 of the previously classified non - da stars , a result which stresses the importance of large aperture telescopes for studying cool white dwarfs , as first emphasized by @xcite .",
    "several additional da , dq , and dz stars were included in the sample as well to test the validity of our model atmosphere calculations , and to improve our understanding of the chemical evolution of cool white dwarfs .",
    "brl found that even though the model energy distributions are somewhat sensitive to the surface gravity , it is practically impossible to determine @xmath55 from the observed photometry alone . only for stars with available trigonometric parallax measurements",
    "is it possible to determine the stellar radius , and thus the mass through the mass - radius relation . in the brl sample ,",
    "67 white dwarfs had trigonometric parallax measurements taken from the yale parallax catalog ( * ? ? ?",

    "the color - magnitude diagram presented in figure [ fg : mv : vmi ] indicates that such systems are mostly composed of da white dwarfs , a result which suggests a particular evolutionary path . we will come back to this point below ( see   [ sbsc : mdist ] ) .",

    "this object with its absolute visual magnitude of @xmath83 was first interpreted as an extremely old  and thus cool  white dwarf .",
    "however , the @xcite analysis convincingly demonstrated that the low luminosity of this object could be attributed to its small radius ( or high mass ) .",
    "the most recent parameters derived for this object come from the brl analysis , @xmath84  k and @xmath85 @xmath6 .",
    "however , as first demonstrated by @xcite , white dwarfs with @xmath86  k become increasingly _ bluer_. an inspection of figure [ fg : mv : vmi ] now suggests an alternate interpretation for eso 439@xmath6726 , namely that this star could be a @xmath87  k , @xmath88 @xmath6  white dwarf ; such a low temperature would imply an age of roughly 13 gyr , i.e.  twice as old as the age determined by brl for this object .",
    "the detailed analysis of the entire energy distribution presented below will show that the infrared @xmath81 magnitude is totally inconsistent with this last interpretation , and that the earlier conclusions reached by @xcite are still valid .",
    "if the overluminous da stars and eso 439@xmath6726 are excluded , all objects in figure [ fg : mv : vmi ] have masses in the range 0.4 0.5ex@xmath89@xmath6  0.5ex1.0 .",
    "if we assume that most da stars have hydrogen - rich atmospheres , as demonstrated by brl , their mean mass inferred from figure [ fg : mv : vmi ] is somewhere around 0.7 @xmath6 .",

    "even though the observed da sequence is well reproduced by the 0.6 @xmath6  pure hydrogen models at the hot end of the sample , an increasing departure is observed above ( @xmath51@xmath52)@xmath94 . in these regions the cool observed da sequence is better reproduced by the pure helium models !",
    "brl proposed an explanation for this departure in terms of a missing opacity source near the @xmath50 filter in the pure hydrogen models , most likely due to a pseudocontinuum opacity originating from the lyman edge ( see   5.2.2 of brl for a complete description ) .",
    "figure 13 of brl shows indeed how the agreement between the observations and the model predictions could be improved by including , even approximately , such an opacity in the model calculations .",
    "however , the lack of a more precise theoretical framework precludes us from including this opacity in our current model grid , and until this can be accomplished , we must refrain from interpreting such ( @xmath50@xmath51 , @xmath51@xmath52 ) diagrams for da stars any further .    on the other hand , the non - da observed sequence in figure [ fg : bmv : vmk ] and the pure helium models are in much better agreement .",
    "non - da stars , most of which have helium - rich atmospheres , are characterized by more transparent atmospheres than hydrogen - rich atmospheres , and as a result , their broadband colors are particularly sensitive to the presence of strong metallic lines or molecular bands . consequently , several non - da stars in figure [ fg : bmv : vmk ] lie well outside the `` mean '' observed sequence .",
    "this is the case for lp 701@xmath6729 ( 2251@xmath67070 ) whose spectrum exhibits a strong drop in the flux shortward of @xmath95   attributed to ca i and ii lines @xcite , lhs 1126 ( 0038@xmath67226 ) which shows a strong infrared flux deficiency attributed to h@xmath5-he collision - induced absorptions @xcite , g165@xmath677 ( 1328@xmath68307 ) a heavily blanketed white dwarf with strong metallic lines @xcite , g240@xmath6772 ( 1748@xmath68708 ) whose spectrum is characterized by a `` yellow sag '' @xmath96% deep and @xmath97   wide ( see , e.g. , fig .",

    "also shown in the da and non - da panels are the model sequences for pure hydrogen , pure helium , and mixed he / h atmospheres .",
    "the departure of the pure hydrogen and mixed he / h models from the pure helium models is due to the collision - induced absorption by molecular hydrogen due to collisions with h@xmath5  and neutral helium , respectively . because of these strong infrared absorption features , the ( @xmath51@xmath78 , @xmath51@xmath52 ) two - color diagram is particularly useful for detecting extremely cool hydrogen - rich white dwarfs , as well as cool white dwarfs with mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheres .",

    "it is again unlikely that the explanation proposed by @xcite , namely that different evolutionary timescales of hydrogen - rich and helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs , can account for the _ observational _ fact shown in the right panel of figure [ fg : vmi : vmk ] , unless non - da stars evolve more rapidly within the gap than outside the gap .",

    "for some of the strongest c@xmath5h stars and for g240@xmath6772 , the molecular absorption features are so important that the quality of the fits is poor . in these cases , we rely on a technique used in brl where the optical spectrum of the star is normalized to a continuum set to unity , and folded with the grid of model spectra . the presence of the strong molecular bands is thus taken into account , at least in first order , in the calculations of the emergent flux distributions .",

    "the most important discriminant between the hydrogen - rich and helium - rich energy distributions lies near the infrared @xmath82 bandpass where hydrogen - dominated atmospheres exhibit a local maximum in their emergent flux due to the bound - free h@xmath23 opacity threshold at 1.6 .",

    "first , the photometric fit has changed little , both qualitatively and quantitatively , a result which implies that the overall results of our analysis remain unaffected by this new parameter .",
    "second , the spectroscopic fit has not changed qualitatively , but the surface gravity has decreased significantly , and most importantly , the photometric and spectroscopic @xmath55 values ( and hence masses ) are now in perfect agreement .",
    "the effective temperatures are also in better agreement .",
    "hence , our results reinforce the conclusions of @xcite that several  but probably not all  cool da stars have helium - enriched atmospheres , with helium abundances as high as @xmath167 .",
    "we note that ( see the following section ) the spectroscopically determined masses for hot db stars can also be brought into better agreement with our photometrically determined values if very small amounts of hydrogen are added to the pure helium model grid .",
    "at least trace amounts of both hydrogen and helium are therefore likely to exist in many cool white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the mass of all white dwarfs in our sample is shown as a function of effective temperature in figure [ fg : spec_evol ] . each object",
    "is represented by a different symbol indicating its atmospheric composition and/or spectral type . filled and open symbols represent hydrogen - rich and helium - rich atmospheric compositions , respectively .",
    "the more specific symbols are discussed in the next section .",
    "a comparison of this figure with figure 35 of brl indicates that our new sample has increased in size considerably , especially above @xmath168  k where the brl sample contains only a few objects .",
    "furthermore , it is possible here to determine stellar masses for all white dwarfs in our sample , in contrast with brl who could only determine masses for about 50% of their sample .",
    "while massive white dwarfs are found with both hydrogen and helium atmospheres , low mass white dwarfs have mostly hydrogen - rich atmospheres , with the exceptions of the dq star g184@xmath6712 ( 1831@xmath68197 ) at @xmath169  k , and lp 31@xmath6740 ( 0324@xmath68738 ) at @xmath170  k. the mass of the former object could be as large as 0.56 @xmath6  due to the large parallax uncertainty , while the latter object lacks the crucial @xmath2 photometry which would allow us to determine its atmospheric constituent more precisely , and this object may well have a hydrogen - rich atmosphere .",
    "consequently , it is probable that all low - mass white dwarfs possess hydrogen - rich atmospheres .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the spectroscopic analyses of hotter ( @xmath171  k ) da and db stars @xcite which revealed the existence of a low mass tail in the mass distribution of da stars which is not observed in the db sample .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure [ fg : mass_distr ] where we compare the mass distributions of the hydrogen- and helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs in our sample ( top panel ) and in the hotter spectroscopic samples ( bottom panel ) ; note that the photometric and spectroscopic samples do not overlap in effective temperature .",
    "since common envelope evolution is required to produce degenerates with mass @xmath172  @xmath6 the galaxy being too young to have produced them from single star evolution  we must conclude that this particular evolutionary channel does not produce helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs , presumably because the objects which go through this close - binary phase end up with hydrogen layers too massive to allow the da to db conversion near @xmath173  k @xcite , or any possible convective mixing below 12,000  k. the fraction of low - mass , hydrogen - rich atmosphere white dwarfs is larger in the parallax sample ( @xmath174% ) than in the spectroscopic sample ( @xmath175% ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the parallax sample , unresolved double degenerate systems composed of two normal 0.6 @xmath6  white dwarfs , for example , will appear as a single overluminous low - mass @xmath123 @xmath6  star , while it will still appear as a single 0.6 @xmath6  object when analyzed spectroscopically .",
    "there are significant differences at high masses as well where the trigonometric parallax sample contains more massive stars ( @xmath176 @xmath6 ) than the spectroscopic sample .",
    "since the former sample is composed of older objects , it is possible that it contains several cases of mergers which would result in a single white dwarf with higher than average mass @xcite .",
    "note that the most massive star in our sample with @xmath177 @xmath6  is eso 439@xmath6726 ( 1136@xmath67286 ) , discussed at length above .",
    "the mean mass of the hydrogen - rich parallax subsample is @xmath178 @xmath6  with a dispersion of @xmath179 @xmath6 , while we find for the helium - rich subsample a mean mass of @xmath180 @xmath6  with a dispersion of @xmath181 @xmath6 ; the combined sample yields @xmath182 @xmath6 , @xmath179 @xmath6 .",
    "the lower mean value of the hydrogen - rich set is entirely due to the existence of the low - mass tail component .",
    "these numbers can be compared with the values derived for the spectroscopic analyses of hotter da stars , @xmath183 @xmath6  and @xmath184 @xmath6  @xcite , and of db stars , @xmath183 @xmath6  and @xmath185 @xmath6   @xcite . note that the dispersions of the spectroscopic mass distributions are considerably smaller due to the increased sensitivity to @xmath55 of the spectroscopic technique over the trigonometric parallax method . while the mean masses obtained for the cool hydrogen atmospheres and warmer da stars",
    "agree well , those of the helium atmospheres and db stars differ by @xmath186 @xmath6 .",
    "as discussed in brl , these results can be somewhat reconciled if small amounts of undetectable hydrogen is present in the cool helium - rich atmospheres .",
    "quantitative results not shown here indicate that the masses derived from the pure helium models could be reduced by @xmath187 @xmath6  were they analyzed with a @xmath188 model grid .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the spectroscopic analyses of da and db stars discussed above are not sensitive to the presence of unknown traces of hydrogen or helium .",
    "indeed , da stars in these studies are restricted to a range of temperature above 15,000  k where the assumption of pure hydrogen atmospheres is most certainly valid due to the gravitational settling of helium @xcite .",
    "similarly , db ( and dba ) stars have temperatures in excess of 12,000  k where the hydrogen abundance is well determined , or at least constrained @xcite .",
    "hence , the spectroscopic mass distributions displayed in figure [ fg : mass_distr ] are not sensitive to unknown abundances of trace elements , unlike the results for cool ( @xmath0  k ) da stars discussed in   [ sbsc : compspec ] and shown in figure [ fg : tspecvstphot ] , in which the presence of spectroscopically invisible helium could overestimate the spectroscopic masses .      out of the 150 objects plotted in figure",
    "[ fg : spec_evol ] , 96 have a hydrogen - rich atmosphere while 54 have a helium - rich atmosphere .",
    "hence 36% of all white dwarfs in our sample have helium - rich atmospheres , a ratio which is significantly larger than the canonical value of 20% for hotter white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the ratio determined here , however , is not constant over the temperature range considered in this analysis .",
    "figure [ fg : h_vs_he ] shows the number of hydrogen - rich and helium - rich stars as a function of effective temperature in 1000  k bins using the results presented in table 2 ; the corresponding hydrogen- to helium - rich ratio is also shown .",
    "the @xmath45000 - 6000 k bin shows a marked increase in the number of white dwarfs with hydrogen - rich atmospheres , and a marked drop in the number with helium - rich atmospheres .",
    "this is the non - da gap first identified by brl . our new results , with a much larger sample and with no overt spectroscopic classification bias , confirms the reality of this gap .",
    "note also that there is no particular concentration of non - da stars below @xmath15  k , nor is there any particular concentration of da stars around 6000  k , contrary to the claim of @xcite .",
    "quite the opposite , hydrogen- and helium - rich white dwarfs in figure [ fg : spec_evol ] are more or less homogeneously distributed in effective temperature , with the exception of the non - da gap itself .",
    "we thus reaffirm our earlier conclusion that some as yet unidentified physical mechanism is responsible for turning helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs into hydrogen - dominated atmospheres near @xmath189  k. the fact that the cooling timescales of these white dwarfs may depend on their atmospheric composition , as observed by @xcite , has nothing to do with the conclusions reached here .",
    "indeed , if the existence of this gap is the result of the spectral evolution of helium - rich into hydrogen - rich white dwarfs , the only important factor is the mass - dependency of the mechanism through which this transition occurs .",
    "if this mechanism  still unknown  is only weakly mass - dependent , then helium - rich white dwarfs will turn into da stars near 6000  k , no matter what their cooling age might be .    an alternative explanation for the non - da gap could be that the blue end of the gap at 6000  k represents the end of the cooling sequence for helium - rich white dwarfs , and that all non - da stars observed below the red end of the gap are the result of convectively mixed da stars at 5000  k. however , the cooling age of helium - rich white dwarfs near 6000  k is only around 4 gyr , and since much older da stars exist , older and cooler helium - rich white dwarfs should exist as well .",
    "the spectroscopic behavior seen in our sample around the gap is also of interest .",
    "to summarize , figure [ fg : spec_evol ] shows that : hydrogen - rich white dwarfs are seen at all effective temperatures ; dq stars are seen at @xmath190  k ; dz at @xmath190  k and 45005500  k ; helium - rich da s at 80009000  k ; c@xmath5h stars at 55006500  k ; and the peculiar group whose featureless energy distributions are better fit with pure hydrogen models at 60007500  k.    at temperatures just above and near the non - da gap , non - da white dwarfs that are neither dq nor dz belong to the peculiar group of white dwarfs whose featureless energy distributions are better fit with pure hydrogen models .",
    "one exception directly above the gap is the dc star g125@xmath673 ( 1917@xmath68386 ) with @xmath191  k. according to @xcite , this object could have barely visible , heavily broadened c@xmath5 bands .",
    "their spectrum which is available to us reveals three weak and broad absorption features which actually match those of c@xmath5h stars , and it is possible that this object belongs to this spectral type , although better spectroscopic observations are required before this result is confirmed .",
    "near 7500  k , there are three additional dc stars .",
    "the coolest object is stein 2051b ( 0426@xmath68588 ) with @xmath192  k , a true dc star according to @xcite who reported featureless optical as well as ultraviolet spectroscopic observations .",
    "the second dc star is g195@xmath6719 ( 0912@xmath68536 , @xmath193  k ) , a polarized @xmath194 mg magnetic white dwarf @xcite , and the last one is lhs 2333 ( 1055@xmath67072 , @xmath195  k ) whose fit has already been discussed in  [ sbsc : herich ] and displayed in figure [ fg : samplenonda ] .",
    "another helium - rich object with only a slightly higher effective temperature is gd 356 ( 1639@xmath68537 , @xmath196  k ) , a dae white dwarf whose spectrum exhibits a hydrogen zeeman triplet in emission @xcite .    most non - da white dwarfs within the non - da gap are c@xmath5h stars .",
    "g240@xmath6772 ( 1748@xmath68708 ) is considered in this spectral class as well , following the interpretation of brl that the observed 15% deep yellow sag near 5000   is the result of c@xmath5h molecular absorption features in the @xmath197 mg magnetic field which characterizes this star .",
    "near the red edge of the gap are lhs 2710 ( 1313@xmath67198 ) and eso 292@xmath6743 ( 2345@xmath67447 ) which have already been identified by brl as being peculiar in that the energy distributions can not be matched by our models ( see their figure 37 and the accompanying discussion ) .",
    "most importantly , _ our new larger sample has not added any new non - da star within the gap_. during the course of our observational survey , every time a previously classified non - da star was found inside the gap , subsequent high signal - to - noise spectroscopy would systematically reveal the presence of h@xmath3 .",
    "note that the new magnetic candidate c@xmath5h star lhs 2229 recently reported by @xcite has an effective temperature of @xmath198  k when analyzed with our fitting technique ( assuming @xmath65 ) .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , c@xmath5h stars may exist well below the red edge of the non - da gap .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fg : spec_evol ] reveal that dq and c@xmath5h stars do not overlap in effective temperature .",
    "indeed , there are no dq stars observed below @xmath199  k , while c@xmath5h stars are found only below this temperature .",
    "this suggests that dq stars probably turn into c@xmath5h stars , and that the existence of the non - da gap and the nature of the c@xmath5h white dwarfs are somehow related . since c@xmath5h stars have been interpreted by @xcite as the result of mixed h / he / c compositions , it is the additional presence of hydrogen in a supposedly helium and carbon mixture that would turn dq stars into c@xmath5h stars when they cool off below 6400  k. the origin of the hydrogen source remains a mystery , however , since the exotic model proposed by brl has been discarded by @xcite based on detailed model simulations .",
    "we just note that the same source of hydrogen , once identified , could be also responsible for turning the remaining non - da stars above @xmath200  k ( dz and peculiar ) into da stars below this temperature .",
    "peculiar white dwarfs whose energy distributions are better reproduced with hydrogen models despite the absence of h@xmath3  are found over a range of effective temperature of 62007600  k , i.e. all above the non - da gap .",
    "the hottest of these stars is lp 434@xmath6797 ( 1154@xmath68186 ) at @xmath201  k. interestingly , immediately above this temperature are the two helium - rich da stars in our sample , l745@xmath6746a ( 0738@xmath67172 ) at @xmath202  k , and ross 640 ( 1626@xmath68368 ) at @xmath203  k. given that there are no other such helium - rich da stars known , it is tempting to suggest that an evolutionary link exists between these objects and the peculiar white dwarfs . above 8000  k , most non - da stars are of the dq type ,",
    "although some are reported to be featureless in the literature .",
    "the number of stars in this temperature range is still too small , however , to draw meaningful conclusions about any spectral evolution from one type to another .",
    "the reappearance of non - da stars below the gap has been interpreted by brl as the result of the convective mixing of the hydrogen atmosphere with the deeper helium envelope , turning da stars into non - da stars .",
    "the calculations reported by brl showed indeed that envelope models which include realistic model atmospheres as boundary conditions could reduce the mixing temperature limit from the canonical value of @xmath20  k down to 5000  k , which occurs for a hydrogen layer mass of @xmath204 .",
    "obviously , some da stars have thicker hydrogen layers since they did not mix , in particular the ( apparent or true ) low - mass white dwarfs which are either unresolved binaries , or the result of common envelope evolution .",
    "we note that the coolest non - da stars in our sample have hydrogen - rich atmospheres despite the lack of any detectable hydrogen absorption features .",
    "while h@xmath3  can be detected almost to the end of the disk cooling sequence , it will certainly not be detected in any cooler white dwarfs discovered in the galactic halo .",
    "our sample contains a higher ratio of non - da to da stars than is seen in the temperature range 12,000 - 30,000  k , where the ratio is around 25% @xcite .",
    "this increase can certainly be interpreted as the result of convective mixing over a still unknown temperature range . since",
    "the 10,00011,000  k bin in figure [ fg : h_vs_he ] already shows a ratio near unity , and since the reappearance of non - da stars in large number below the non - da gap has also been interpreted as the result of convective mixing , we can conclude that the convective mixing mechanism operate from @xmath205  k , all the way down to the coolest possible mixing temperature near 5000  k. this implies that da stars must possess a large range of possible hydrogen layer thicknesses , including very thick hydrogen layers above @xmath206 .    out of the 13 magnetic white dwarfs in our sample",
    " 8 with hydrogen - rich and 5 with helium - rich atmospheres , 12 are located in a narrow range of effective temperature between @xmath207 and 8000  k ; the exception is gw@xmath6870 8247 ( 1900@xmath68705 ) at @xmath208  k. it is possible that the lower boundary represents only a selection effect since zeeman splitting would make the detection of h@xmath3  more difficult in cool magnetic da stars than in non - magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "however , the spectrum of the coolest magnetic star in our sample , lhs 1734 ( 0503@xmath67174 ) , still exhibits strong h@xmath3  absorption features ( see the spectrum in fig .  5 of brl ) , and the detection of even weaker features is well within the detection limit of our spectroscopic observations .",
    "furthermore , while there are no magnetic white dwarfs in the three dozen or so objects included in our sample between @xmath209 and 12,000 k , a few magnetic stars in this particular range of effective temperature are known to exist @xcite .",
    "all the features of the chemical distribution shown in figure [ fg : spec_evol ] can not be accounted for by convective mixing alone , however , or by any simple theoretical model .",
    "hence we are left with very few possible explanations , despite the abundance of observational clues unveiled in brl and in this analysis .",
    "given these results , it is worth repeating and developing an alternative explanation proposed by brl who questioned the stability of convectively mixed hydrogen and helium convection zones .",
    "consider a 0.6 @xmath6 , pure helium atmosphere white dwarf which accretes @xmath210 @xmath6  of hydrogen by the time it reaches 6000  k. this value is totally plausible if one allows a low accretion rate from the interstellar medium of @xmath211 @xmath6  yr@xmath212 over a period of @xmath213 gyr or so .",
    "since the mass of the helium convection zone is almost constant below @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) , the resulting abundance of @xmath49 would make the star appear as a non - da white dwarf at 6000 k , h@xmath3  being wiped out by van der waals broadening with neutral helium .",
    "it is reasonable to wonder whether such a mixed hydrogen and helium convection zone would remain convectively stable as the results shown in figure 40 of brl indicate that a da star with a hydrogen layer mass of @xmath210 @xmath6 or slightly larger , would not have mixed in the first place , at least not at @xmath216  k. it is possible that convectively mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheres return to a well separated hydrogen - dominated atmosphere with a helium - rich envelope .",
    "note that the chemical separation needs to be complete only in the photospheric layers for the atmosphere to appear hydrogen - rich .",
    "such `` born again ''",
    "da stars can not retain a da signature for long , however . as the star cools from @xmath216",
    "k down to 5000  k , the bottom of the hydrogen atmosphere further plunges from @xmath217 to @xmath218 ( depending on the mass of the star , see fig .  4 of brl ) , leading to another episode of convective mixing , and supporting the trends seen in figure [ fg : spec_evol ] .",
    "if the separation of hydrogen and helium layers does occur , we can speculate about what the energy distribution of these stars might look like at the moment just before the separation occurs .",
    "obviously , the hydrogen and helium abundance profiles throughout the atmosphere will be very inhomogeneous , even over the disk surface .",
    "perhaps this would explain why brl ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were unable to fit the energy distributions of those peculiar white dwarfs above 6000  k with pure hydrogen , pure helium , or _",
    "homogeneously mixed _ hydrogen and helium compositions .",
    "models with inhomogeneous abundance profiles could hold the key to these peculiar stars .",
    "we note finally that if the total mass of hydrogen is small , the convectively mixed hydrogen and helium layer is stable",
    ". this can certainly be the case for the c@xmath5h stars with mixed atmospheres of hydrogen , helium , and carbon , as well as ross 640 and l745@xmath6746a , which are simply too hot and thus too young to have accreted enough hydrogen ( these objects have @xmath37 ) .",
    "the isochrones for our c / o core evolutionary models with thin and thick hydrogen layers are shown in figures [ fg : isochrone_co_thin ] and [ fg : isochrone_co_thick ] , respectively . in these plots , we no longer distinguish between objects with hydrogen- and helium - rich atmospheres since the atmospheric composition of these stars may have changed several times over their lifetime , and as such , it is not a trivial task to associate a cooling age to a single object , as discussed in the introduction . also shown",
    "are the corresponding isochrones but with the main sequence lifetime added to the white dwarf cooling age ; here we simply assume @xcite @xmath219 gyr and @xmath220 $ ] .",
    "as can be seen from these results , white dwarfs with @xmath221 @xmath6  can not have c / o cores , and yet have been formed from single star evolution within the lifetime of this galaxy . as discussed above , some of these low - mass objects must be either unresolved double degenerates , or single white dwarfs with helium cores . in the former case ,",
    "the stellar masses inferred from these figures are underestimated  especially if the unresolved components have comparable luminosities , and the corresponding cooling ages derived here become meaningless . while some of these low - mass white dwarfs may still be interpreted as having c / o cores when the masses are corrected to allow for two objects in the system , the lowest mass objects in our sample would still yield `` corrected '' masses too low to be c / o - core degenerates .",
    "the second possibility corresponds to single ( or binary ) helium - core degenerates whose core mass was truncated by case b mass transfer before helium ignition was reached .",
    "such low - mass white dwarfs would be best described with helium - core evolutionary models . however , since it is impossible to distinguish between the two possibilities discussed above for most of the low - mass stars in our sample , we refrain from interpreting these objects any further .    in this temperature regime ,",
    "low - mass ( i.e.  large - radius ) white dwarfs evolve faster than their more massive counterparts , with the exception of the most massive objects ( @xmath176 @xmath6 ) in which the onset of crystallization reduces the cooling timescales considerably .",
    "these begin to cool off much more rapidly than the lower mass stars to produce the observed parabola - shaped isochrones . with decreasing effective temperature",
    ", crystallization gradually occurs in lower mass models , and the turning point of these parabolas moves slowly towards lower masses .",
    "consequently , the inferred stellar ages are strongly mass - dependent , a result which stresses the importance of determining reliable masses through precise trigonometric parallax measurements",
    ". the best example is provided by eso 439@xmath6726 ( 1136@xmath67286 ) , the most massive object in our sample , which could have an inferred cooling age anywhere between 5 and 7.5 gyr if its mass was not known ( assuming thin hydrogen layer models ) .",
    "the effect of using different thicknesses for the outer hydrogen layer varies as a function of the mass of the star as well .",
    "for instance , the coolest white dwarfs near 0.6 @xmath6  have cooling ages of roughly 8 gyr with the thin hydrogen layer models , and 1 gyr _ older _ with the thick models . out of the three oldest objects in our sample , two have hydrogen - rich atmospheres , the coolest of which is er 8 ( 1310@xmath67472 ) with @xmath222  k and mass near 0.6 @xmath6 .",
    "if we make the assumption that this star has a thick hydrogen envelope , the corresponding white dwarf cooling age is @xmath223 gyr ( @xmath224 gyr ) . the oldest object in figure [ fg : isochrone_co_thick ] , lp 701@xmath6729 ( 2251@xmath67070 ) with @xmath225  k , has a helium - rich atmosphere and it thus can not have had a thick outer hydrogen layer , otherwise it would have remained hydrogen - rich .",
    "its more probable age derived from figure [ fg : isochrone_co_thin ] is actually much shorter , @xmath226 gyr ( @xmath227 gyr ) .",
    "there are two objects in our sample cooler than er 8 with hydrogen - rich atmospheres with apparently low masses of @xmath228 @xmath6 , lhs 239 ( 0747@xmath68073b , @xmath72  k ) and lp 131@xmath6766 ( 1247@xmath68550 , 4050  k ) .",
    "if these objects are in fact an unresolved pair of normal mass white dwarfs then the total age of these systems is around 10  gyr .",
    "a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 152 cool white dwarfs with trigonometric parallax measurements was presented .",
    "optical and infrared photometry were combined and compared with an improved grid of model atmosphere calculations to determine the effective temperatures and the solid angles for all objects , which combined with the measured parallaxes yielded the stellar radii .",
    "the latter were then converted into stellar masses through the mass - radius relations obtained from new evolutionary models which best characterize cool white dwarfs .",
    "these have carbon / oxygen cores , with both thin @xmath229 and thick @xmath230 hydrogen layers .",
    "this parallax sample more than doubles the number of cool white dwarfs with known masses compared to the sample presented in brl .",
    "furthermore , this new sample is more representative of the population of cool white dwarf stars as it contains , presumably , no bias in favor of any particular spectral type , as opposed to the brl sample which favored non - da stars .",
    "one of the main results of our analysis is the confirmation of the existence of a range in effective temperature between roughly 5000 and 6000  k in which almost all white dwarfs have hydrogen - rich atmospheres .",
    "the only non - da stars in this range of effective temperature are the so - called c@xmath5h stars which are believed to represent the cooler stage of the dq sequence , found only above the gap .",
    "clearly , the existence of this gap holds the key to our understanding of the chemical evolution of cool white dwarfs .",
    "unfortunately , our understanding of the physical mechanisms that could alter the atmospheric composition of cool white dwarfs as they evolve are at best sketchy . after the `` phase transition '' model proposed in brl",
    "was convincingly discarded by @xcite , very few alternatives exist .",
    "it has become clear from our analysis , however , that convection plays an important role , but that our understanding of what to expect from the result of convective mixing needs to be revised . it is generally believed that when the bottom of the thin hydrogen convection zone deepens and reaches the underlying and more massive convective helium envelope , convective mixing will occur , and that the resulting atmospheric composition will simply be governed by the mass ratio of the hydrogen and helium convection zones .",
    "such arguments lead to predicted abundances after convective mixing of @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath234 , for mixing temperatures of @xmath235 , 10,000 , 8500 , and 6500  k , respectively , the mixing temperature depending on the exact thickness of the hydrogen layer .",
    "our analysis has demonstrated that such objects do not exist , at least in our sample .",
    "even the objects which possess mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheres , and in particular ross 640 and l745@xmath6746a , have abundances that do not fit this simple convective mixing picture . on the other hand , the definite increase of the ratio of non - da to da stars in the temperature range considered in this analysis with respect to that of hotter white dwarfs can not easily be explained in terms other than convective mixing .",
    "also , convective mixing has been called upon to explain the reappearance of non - da stars below the non - da gap near 5000  k.    a different picture is now starting to emerge from our findings , and those of other analyses , in which convective mixing _ processes _ may lead to predicted chemical abundances that differ from the standard model .",
    "first , our comparison of atmospheric parameters determined from photometry and spectroscopy reveals that a mass discrepancy exists in several da stars , and that this discrepancy can be resolved if we allow some amount of helium to be present in their atmospheres .",
    "the required abundances close to @xmath236 are clearly at odds with the standard convective mixing model predictions , as noted also by @xcite .",
    "note that helium is spectroscopically invisible in the temperature regime considered here and can not be detected directly .",
    "it is possible to conceive that helium is being brought to the surface not by convective mixing , but perhaps by convective overshooting of the helium convection zone into the hydrogen layer .",
    "the bottom of the hydrogen convection zone would then carry some of this helium to the surface , in a very similar fashion to the way carbon is being brought to the photosphere of dq stars , with the exception that ordinary diffusion is responsible in this case for polluting the bottom of the helium layer with carbon .",
    "a variance of the convective model that could account for the existence of the non - da gap has also been proposed .",
    "the question arises when one considers a helium - rich atmosphere on top of which indefinite amounts of hydrogen are accumulated , presumably from interstellar accretion .",
    "it is clear that the hydrogen abundance ratio will gradually increase until some point where the homogeneously mixed hydrogen and helium convection zone can no longer be sustained . a stable chemical separation between the hydrogen and the helium layers",
    "could then occur , leading to the predominance of da stars below @xmath216  k. the implication of this proposed model is that cool white dwarfs must accrete reasonable amounts of hydrogen from the interstellar medium for this mechanism to work .",
    "also , it was proposed that the chemical separation could occur in a non - homogeneous fashion , leading to chemically inhomogeneous atmospheres , similar to the hotter dab stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such inhomogeneous atmospheres could perhaps account for the peculiar objects identified in our sample whose energy distributions share both characteristics of hydrogen and helium atmospheres .",
    "given the complexity of the chemical evolution of cool white dwarf atmospheres revealed in our analysis , it is not clear what evolutionary models should be used to derive cooling ages .",
    "thin and thick hydrogen layer models yield cooling ages which differ by 2 gyr in some cases .",
    "non - da stars are probably better characterized by thin hydrogen models ; even if they were once da stars , they probably had thin hydrogen layers anyway in order to eventually mix . but cool da stars may have thin or thick hydrogen layers .",
    "thick hydrogen layer white dwarfs remain da forever , but the fraction of such stars is still unknown .",
    "the problem becomes even more complex when one attempts to determine the age of the galactic disk using the luminosity function of cool white dwarfs .",
    "the theoretical luminosity functions should in fact reflect the actual population of cool white dwarfs , and should be a combination of thin and thick hydrogen layer models .",
    "the problems are greatly simplified for hotter da , db , or do stars . from the results presented here , the oldest white dwarfs in our sample have a minimum stellar age of 8.5 gyr , but",
    "are more likely characterized by models with thick hydrogen layers which yield an age around 9.5 gyr .",
    "we feel at this point that we have pushed both the observational and theoretical aspects of this cool white dwarf study to their limits , and that more work now needs to be done on the theoretical front to explain the various features discovered in this analysis .",
    "several avenues of investigation have been proposed , most of which are related to our poor understanding of convective mixing .",
    "we wish to acknowledge g.  fontaine for calculating the cooling models used in our analysis , p. brassard for making his evolutionary code available to us , and g.  d. schmidt for his spectropolarimetric observations of the magnetic white dwarf candidates .",
    "we are deeply grateful to the various observatories for awarding us so many nights for this project and to all the staff at the observatories who were extremely helpful .",
    "we also wish to thank the referee for pointing us out the results of jorgensen et al .",
    "of which we were unaware .",

    "<S> a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of cool ( @xmath0  k ) white dwarf stars is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the sample has been drawn from the yale parallax catalog and from a proper - motion survey in the southern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> optical @xmath1 and infrared @xmath2 photometry , as well as spectroscopy at h@xmath3 , have been secured for a sample of 152 white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of seven new da white dwarfs , two new dq white dwarfs , one new magnetic white dwarf , and three weak magnetic white dwarf candidates , is reported . </S>",
    "<S> our sample also identifies 19 known or suspected double degenerates .    </S>",
    "<S> the photometric energy distributions , the h@xmath3  line profiles , and the trigonometric parallax measurements are combined and compared against the predictions of model atmosphere calculations to determine the effective temperature and the radius of each object in the sample , and also to constrain the atmospheric composition . </S>",
    "<S> new evolutionary sequences with carbon / oxygen cores with thin and thick hydrogen layers are used to derive stellar masses and ages . </S>",
    "<S> the results are used to improve our understanding of the chemical evolution of cool white dwarfs .    </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the existence of a range in effective temperature between @xmath45000 and 6000  k where almost all white dwarfs have hydrogen - rich atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> our sample shows little evidence for mixed h / he white dwarfs , with the exception of two helium - rich da stars , and four ( possibly five ) c@xmath5h white dwarfs which have been interpreted as having mixed h / he / c atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> the observed sequence of dq stars is found to terminate abruptly near 6500  k , below which they are believed to turn into c@xmath5h stars . </S>",
    "<S> true dc stars slightly above this temperature are found to exhibit hydrogen - like energy distributions despite the lack of h@xmath3  absorption features . </S>",
    "<S> the mean mass of our complete sample is 0.65 @xmath6  with a dispersion of @xmath7 @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> attempts to interpret the chemical evolution of cool white dwarfs show the problem to be complex . </S>",
    "<S> convective mixing is called upon to account for the increase of the non - da to da ratio below 12,000  k , as well as the reappearance of helium - rich stars below @xmath8  k. the possible presence of helium in cool da stars , the existence of the non - da gap , and the nature of the peculiar dc stars are also explained in terms of convective mixing , although our understanding of how this mechanism works needs to be revised in order to account for these observations . </S>",
    "<S> given this chemical evolution uncertainty , it is not clear whether thick or thin hydrogen layer models should be used to determine cooling ages . </S>",
    "<S> the oldest object in our sample is @xmath47.9  gyr or @xmath49.7  gyr old depending on whether thin or thick hydrogen layer models are used , respectively . </S>"
