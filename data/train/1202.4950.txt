    "the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 in january 2001 @xcite ignited enthusiasm and interest in exploring its material properties .",
    "several remarkable features , for example a high transition temperature ( @xmath2 40 k ) , a high critical field , and a low rf surface resistance below @xmath3 , shows great potential in several applications such as superconducting wires and magnets .",
    "the success of making high quality epitaxial mgb@xmath0 thin films provides another promising application as an alternative material coating on superconducting radio frequency ( srf ) cavities @xcite . over the past decade",
    ", the improvement of accelerating gradient in niobium ( nb ) srf cavities has almost reached the bcs limit , 57 @xmath4 @xcite . in order to go further , new high @xmath5 materials with low rf resistance",
    "are required for interior coating of bulk nb cavities .",
    "high quality mgb@xmath0 thin films may satisfy the demands for srf coating materials because these high quality films can avoid the weak link nonlinearity between grains , and lead to the possibility of making high - q cavities @xcite .",
    "however , there still exist mechanisms that produce non - ideal behavior at low temperatures under high rf magnetic fields , such as vortex nucleation and motion in the film @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the @xmath1 band and @xmath6 band , the intrinsic nonlinear meissner effect of mgb@xmath0 is large compared to other single - gap s - wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore the study of mgb@xmath0 microwave nonlinear response in the high frequency region ( usually several ghz in srf applications ) can reveal the dissipative and nondisipative nonlinear mechanisms and allow application of these high quality mgb@xmath0 films as cavity coatings .",
    "+ in our experiment the localized harmonic response of superconductors is excited by a magnetic write head probe extracted from a commercial magnetic hard drive @xcite .",
    "based on the gap geometry of the magnetic write head probe , sub micron resolution is expected .",
    "we present our observation of at least two measurable nonlinear mechanisms involved in high quality mgb@xmath0 films below @xmath3 .",
    "these films were grown on sapphire substrates by hybrid physical - chemical vapor deposition technique ( hpcvd ) .",
    "a detailed description of the growth technique has been reported before @xcite .",
    "finally , experimental nonlinearity data will be interpreted as a combination of intrinsic nonlinear response  @xcite and vortex nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup for amplitude and phase measurements of the superconductor harmonic response is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_setup ] .",
    "an excited wave ( fundamental signal ) at frequency @xmath7 comes from the vector network analyzer ( vna ) and is low - pass filtered to eliminate higher harmonics of the source signal .",
    "this fundamental tone is sent to the magnetic write head probe to generate a localized rf magnetic field on the superconductor sample .",
    "two insets in fig .",
    "[ figure_setup ] shows close - up views of our magnetic write head probe on superconducting samples . due to the intense nature of this field",
    ", the superconductor responds by generating currents at both the fundamental frequency and at harmonics of this frequency .",
    "the generated harmonic signal is high - pass filtered to remove the fundamental signal @xmath8 and an un - ratioed measurement of @xmath9 is performed on port 2 of the vna . in order to get a phase - sensitive measurement of the @xmath10 harmonic signal coming from the superconducting sample , a harmonic generation circuit is connected to provide a reference @xmath10 harmonic signal , and the relative phase difference between the main circuit and reference circuit is measured .",
    "further detail about this phase - sensitive measurement technique can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this way we measure the complex third harmonic voltage of @xmath11 or the corresponding scalar power @xmath12 .",
    "the lowest noise floor in our vna is -145 dbm for the un - ratioed power measurement . a ratioed measurement of the complex @xmath13 is also performed at the same time . in this paper",
    "we only discuss the unratioed measurements of @xmath12 and qualitatively discuss the mechanisms of third harmonic response of the mgb@xmath14 film .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath10 order harmonic power ( @xmath15 ) is performed near the center of the epitaxial mgb@xmath0 film of thickness 50 nm .",
    "the @xmath5 of this sample is 36 k as measured by the four point resistance method .",
    "figure [ mgb2_50 nm ] shows the temperature dependent @xmath16 curves at the excited frequency 5.33 ghz and excited power + 14 dbm . above 40 k a very small signal begins to arise above the noise floor of the network analyzer .",
    "this @xmath15 is from the magnetic write head probe itself .",
    "we have measured the @xmath15 of the magnetic probe on the surface of a bare sapphire substrate and in general this probe nonlinearity is negligible at excited powers under 14 dbm .",
    "although excited powers above + 14 dbm excites stronger nonlinearity from the probe , this nonlinearity is almost temperature independent in the helium cooling temperature range .",
    "therefore probe nonlinearity can be treated as a constant background signal above the noise floor of the spectrum analyzer .",
    "the mechanism of probe nonlinearity is the hysteretic behavior of the yoke material @xcite and has been discussed previously @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ mgb2_50 nm ] , a clear @xmath16 peak centered at 35 k shows up above the noise floor .",
    "this peak arises from the intrinsic nonlinear meissner effect ( nlme ) at @xmath5 due to the enhanced sensitivity of superconducting properties as the superfluid density decreases to near - zero levels .",
    "this peak at @xmath3 is also phenomenologically predicted by ginzburg - landau theory , and is discussed further below .",
    "we also note the onset of a low temperature nonlinearity below 27 k , which implies that another temperature dependent nonlinear mechanism is active .",
    "it may be that the applied rf field from the probe is strong enough to penetrate into the superconductor and create deep flux penetration or even abrikosov vortices in a localized area .",
    "this new nonlinear mechanism dominates the overall measured nonlinearity in the low temperature region .",
    "further qualitative discussion of the low temperature nonlinearity from a possible abrikosov vortex critical state will be addressed in detail below .",
    "in addition , in the temperature regime of @xmath17 , there is a minimum @xmath15 signal , which implies no strong nonlinearity mechanisms in this temperature range .",
    "the supercurrent of a vortex circulates around the normal core with an approximate size of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath18 .",
    "therefore once @xmath19 is bigger than the film thickness ( 50 nm in this case ) above a certain temperature , vortex penetration due to parallel magnetic field will be suppressed @xcite .",
    "this regime would be very suitable to fabricate a low nonlinearity superconducting response in a multi - layer superconductor / insulator structure @xcite .",

    "the first term on the right hand side is the lorentz force per unit length on the vortex due to the screening currents created by the driving field .",

    "a vortex will start to nucleate and enter into the film when @xmath57 exceeds the bean - livingston barrier @xcite .",

    "this second vortex will annihilate with the first vortex at time @xmath62 .",
    "this procedure of vortex - antivortex entry and annihilation continues and will generate a third harmonic signal .    for further quantitative modeling , the following two cases should been taken into consideration :    \\(1 ) finite thickness of the film .",

    "this modification for a second image force will help improve the quantitative modeling .",
    "+ ( 2 ) surface roughness of the film + in the bean - livingston model the superconducitng surface is assumed to be a perfect plane  @xcite . when the surface has roughness with characteristic length @xmath64 @xmath65 ( coherence length ) , a geometry effect should be taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "generally , for a sharper corner , the meissner screening current density will be enhanced and the penetration field of the first vortex entry ( @xmath66 ) will decrease .",
    "for example , at a corner with a @xmath67 angle , an enhancement of the screening current is roughly estimated to be a factor of 4 @xcite .",
    "this means a vortex will penetrate at sharp points or cusps easily and reduce the vortex nucleation time during the rf cycle .",
    "therefore , nonlinear harmonic response will be increased compared to the case of a perfect plane . hence for a given excitation level , the harmonic response will depend on the surface topography , and an image showing this contrast can be built up by raster scanning the magnetic probe .",
    "+      in addition to vortex and antivortex nucleation and motion , another possibility to generate a @xmath15 in the abrikosov vortex critical state is the switching between this state and the nonlinear meissner state .",
    "while the peak value of the applied rf magnetic field is higher than the surface penetration field of the superconductor , the material will switch into the critical vortex state from the meissner state .",
    "this process of switching between states implies another source of nonlinear harmonic response .",

    "a magnetic flux @xmath70 is channeled down along the yoke to the gap . there",
    "the flux can divide into two branches : one directly goes through the gap with a reluctance @xmath71 and the other shunts into the superconductor with a reluctance @xmath72 .",
    "the reluctance of superconductor @xmath72 is a time - variable reluctance .",
    "it is a combination of the reluctance @xmath73 from the nonlinear meissner state and the reluctance @xmath74 from the vortex critical state .",
    "while the applied field @xmath57 is smaller than the penetration field @xmath59 , the reluctance will remain at the value of @xmath73 .",
    "once @xmath57 @xmath64 @xmath59 , an additional reluctance channel @xmath74 is created .",
    "whether the vortex enters as a semi - loop ( as assumed above ) , or as a vortex - antivortex pair , remains to be evaluated .",
