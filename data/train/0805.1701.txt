    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is the basic source of non - classical light in experimental quantum optics @xcite , testing foundations of the quantum theory @xcite , and implementing protocols for quantum information information processing and communication @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of spdc is the guarantee that the photons are always produced in pairs , and suitable arrangements allow one to generate various types of classical and quantum correlations within those pairs .",
    "the physics of spdc depends strongly on optical properties of nonlinear media in which the process is realized .",
    "this leads to an interplay between different characteristics of the source and usually imposes trade - offs on its performance .",
    "for example , many experiments require photon pairs to be prepared in well - defined single spatio - temporal modes .",
    "in contrast , photons generated in typical media diverge into large solid angles and are often correlated in space and time , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : source ] .",
    "specific modes can be selected afterwards by coupling the output light into single - mode fibers and inserting narrowband spectral filters .",
    "however , it is usually not guaranteed that both the photons in a pair will always have the matching modal characteristics , and in many cases only one of the twin photons will get coupled in @xcite .",
    "this effect , which can be modelled as a loss mechanism for the produced light , destroys perfect correlations in the numbers of twin photons .",
    "these losses come in addition to imperfect detection , and can be described jointly using overall efficiency parameters .",
    "is pumped with a laser beam @xmath0 .",
    "generated photons are highly correlated and useful modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are typically selected by narrow spatial and frequency filters @xmath3 . ]",
    "the effects of losses become more critical when the spdc source is pumped with powers so high that it is no longer possible to neglect the contribution of events when multiple pairs have been simultaneously produced @xcite .",
    "such a regime is necessary to carry out multiphoton interference experiments , it can be also approached when increasing the production rate of photon pairs .",
    "one is then usually interested in postselecting through photocounting the down - conversion term with a fixed number of photon pairs and observing its particular quantum statistical features @xcite . in the presence of losses",
    "the same number of photocounts can be generated by higher - order terms when some of the photons escape detection .",
    "however , the statistical properties of such events can be completely different , thus masking the features of interest .",
    "although some quantum properties may persist even in this regime , with a notable example of polarization entanglement @xcite , their extraction and utilization becomes correspondingly more difficult .",
    "the present paper is an experimental study of multiphoton events in spontaneous parametric down - conversion with particular attention paid to the effects of filtering and losses .",
    "the multiple - pair regime is achieved by pumping the nonlinear crystal by the frequency - doubled output of a 300  khz titanium - sapphire regenerative amplifier system . the kilohertz repetition rate has allowed us to count the number of the photons at the output with the help of the loop detector @xcite . using a simplified theoretical description of the spdc source we introduce effective parameters that characterize its performance in multiphoton experiments .",
    "the obtained results illustrate trade - offs involved in experiments with multiple photon pairs and enable one to select the optimal operation regime for specific applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we describe a theoretical model for spdc statistics in sec .",
    "[ sec : spdcstat ] .",
    "[ sec : parameters ] introduces effective parameters to characterize spdc sources .",
    "the experimental setup and measurement results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "we will start with a simple illustration of the effects of higher - order terms in spdc .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the source produces a two - mode squeezed state which can be written in the perturbative expansion as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 measures squeezing and is assumed to be real . for two - photon experiments , the relevant term is @xmath6 and the contribution of the higher photon number terms",
    "can be neglected as long as @xmath7 .",
    "this enables postselecting the two - photon term and observing associated quantum effects , such as hong - ou - mandel interference .",
    "suppose now that each of the modes is subject to losses characterized by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the overall efficiency .",
    "losses may transform the term @xmath10 into @xmath11 or @xmath12 , whose presence will lower the visibility of the hong - ou - mandel interference .",
    "the two - photon term now occurs with the probability @xmath13 , while the four - photon term effectively produces one of the states @xmath11 or @xmath12 with the total probability equal to @xmath14 .",
    "this constitutes a fraction of @xmath15 of the events that come from single pairs produced by the source .",
    "this fraction can easily become comparable with one , especially when the losses are large .",
    "let us now develop a general model of photon statistics produced by an spdc source . in the limit of a classical undepleted pump the output field is described by a pure multimode squeezed state . by a suitable choice of spatio - temporal modes , called characteristic modes , such a state can be brought to the normal form @xcite in which modes are squeezed pairwise . denoting the annihilation operators of the characteristic modes by @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the non - vanishing second - order moments can be written as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the squeezing parameter for the @xmath20th pair of modes .",
    "because the state of light produced in spdc is gaussian , these equations , combined with the fact that first - order moments vanish @xmath21 define fully quantum statistical properties of the output field .",
    "let us first consider the case when the spatial and spectral filters placed after the source select effectively single field modes .",
    "the annihilation operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by linear combinations of the characteristic modes : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe amplitude transmissivities of the filters for the characteristic modes and @xmath27 . because the complete multimode state is gaussian , the reduced state of the modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 is also gaussian , and it is fully characterized by the average numbers of photons @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the moment @xmath30 .",
    "these quantities can be written in terms of the multimode moments given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:<aa>,<ab > ] ) , but we will not need here explicit expressions .",
    "it will be convenient to describe the quantum state of the modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the help of the wigner function : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the correlation matrix composed of symmetrically ordered second order moments : @xmath34    given the wigner function of the reduced state for the modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the gaussian form , the calculation of the joint count statistics @xmath35 is straightforward .",
    "it will be useful to introduce an operator representing the generating function of the joint count statistics @xmath36 whose expectation value over the quantum state expanded into the power series yields the joint count statistics @xmath37 : @xmath38 because the operator @xmath39 is formally equal , up to a normalization constant , to product of density matrices describing thermal states of modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 with average photon numbers @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , the corresponding wigner function has a gaussian form : @xmath42    using the above expression it is easy to evaluate the generating function for the joint count statistics by integrating the product of the respective wigner functions : @xmath43 where we introduced the following three parameters : @xmath44 these three parameters have a transparent physical interpretation in the regime when @xmath45 . then , it is easy to check that the generating function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi(x , y)=squeezedwlosses ] ) describes the count statistics of a plain two - mode squeezed state whose two modes have been sent through lossy channels with transmissivities @xmath9 and @xmath46 , and the average number of photons produced in each of the modes was equal to @xmath47 .",
    "note that the inequality @xmath45 implies nonclassical correlations between the modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if the opposite condition is satisfied , the state can be represented as a statistical mixture of coherent states in modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 with correlated amplitudes . in this case , it is not possible to carry out an absolute measurement of losses .",
    "in a realistic situation , the spectral filters employed in the setup are never sufficiently narrowband to ensure completely coherent filtering",
    ". therefore a sum of counts originating from multiple modes will be observed .",
    "we will model this effect by assuming that the detected light is composed of a certain number of @xmath48 modes with identical quantum statistical properties described in the preceding section .",
    "the generating function @xmath49 for count statistics is therefore given by the @xmath48-fold product of the expectation value @xmath50 calculated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi(x , y)=squeezedwlosses ] ) : @xmath51 the parameter @xmath48 , which we will call the equivalent number of modes , can be read out from the variance of the count statistics in one of the arms characterized by the generating function @xmath49 . for a single mode source",
    "the variance is equal to that of a thermal state with @xmath52 .",
    "it is easily seen that for @xmath48 equally populated modes the variance becomes reduced to the value @xmath53 .",
    "solving this relation for @xmath48 leads us to a measurable parameter that will help us to characterize the effective number of detected modes : @xmath54 note that @xmath48 is closely related to the inverse of the mandel parameter @xcite .",
    "the second parameter we will use to characterize the spdc source measures the overall losses experienced by the produced photons . let us first note that in the perturbative regime , when all the squeezing parameters @xmath55 , each one of the quantities @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r2,eta = onemode ] ) is proportional to the pump intensity . in this regime",
    "the efficiencies can be approximated by the ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 that are independent of the pump intensity .",
    "on the other hand , the average photon numbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 in both the arms are linear in the pump power .    following early works on squeezing @xcite , we will introduce here a parameter that quantifies the subpoissonian character of correlations between the counts @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the two arms of the setup .",
    "first we define a stochastic variable : @xmath65 this definition takes into account the possibility of different losses in the two arms through a suitable normalization of the count numbers .",
    "the subpoissonian character of the correlations can be tested by measuring the average @xmath66 .",
    "the semiclassical theory predicts @xmath67 , while for two beams with count statistics characterized by the generating function @xmath68 one obtains : @xmath69 in the case of equal efficiencies @xmath70 this expression reduces simply to @xmath71 .",
    "we will use the last relation as a method to measure the average overall efficiency of detecting the state produced by the spdc source .    as discussed at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : spdcstat ] , the initial quantum state of light used for many experiments should ideally be in a state @xmath6 or @xmath10 .",
    "in the perfect case of two - mode squeezing and negligible losses , such states can be isolated through postselection of the spdc output on the appropriate number of counts . in practice",
    ", the postselected events will also include other combinations of input photon numbers .",
    "because typical detectors have limited or no photon number resolution , one needs to take into account also the deleterious contribution of higher total photon numbers .",
    "this leads us to the following definition of the parameter measuring the contamination of photon pairs with other terms that can not be in general removed through postselection : @xmath72 an analogous definition can be given for quadruples of photons , which ideally should be prepared in a state @xmath10 : @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2imp ] we depict contour plots of the contamination parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 as a function of the production rates and the overall efficiency .",
    "it is clearly seen that the non - unit efficiency imposes severe bounds on the production rates that guarantee single or double photon pair events sufficiently free from spurious terms .",
    "the graphs also imply that strong pumping is not a sufficient condition to achieve high production rates , but it needs to be combined with a high efficiency of collecting and detecting photons .",

    "the calculations have been carried out in the regime of single selected modes when @xmath78.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the experimental setup is depicted in the fig .  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the master laser ( rega 9000 from coherent ) produces a train of 165  fs fwhm long pulses at a 300  khz repetition rate centered at the wavelength 774  nm , with 300  mw average power .",
    "the pulses are doubled in the second harmonic generator xsh based on a 1  mm thick beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal cut for a type - i process .",
    "ultraviolet pulses produced this way have 1.3  nm bandwidth and 30  mw average power .",
    "they are filtered out of the fundamental using a pair of dichroic mirrors dm and a color glass filter bg ( schott bg39 ) , and imaged using a 20  cm focal length lens il on a downcoversion crystal x , where they form a spot measured to be 155  @xmath79 m in diameter .",
    "the power of the ultraviolet pulses , prepared in the polarization perpendicular to the plane of the setup , is adjusted using neutral density filters nd and a motorized half waveplate .",
    "the type - i down - conversion process takes place in a 1  mm thick bbo crystal x cut at @xmath80 to the optic axis , and oriented for the maximum source intensity .",
    "the down - converted light emerging at the angle of @xmath81 to the pump beam is coupled into a pair of single mode fibers placed at the opposite ends of the down - conversion cone .",
    "the fibers and the coupling optics define the spatial modes in which the down - conversion is observed @xcite . the coupled photons enter the loop detector @xcite in which light from either arm can propagate towards one of the detectors through eight distinct paths .",
    "the minimal delay difference between two paths is 100  ns , more than twice the dead time of the detectors .",
    "finally the photons exit the fiber circuit , go through interference filters if and are coupled into multimode fibers which route them directly to single photon counting modules spcm ( perkinelmer spcm - aqr-14-fc ) connected to fast coincidence counting electronics ( custom - programmed virtex4 protype board ml403 from xilinx ) detecting events in a proper temporal relation to the master laser pulses .",
    "the measurement series are carried out with pairs of interference filters of varying spectral widths .",
    "the measurement proceeds as follows : for each pair of interference filters the loop detector is calibrated using data collected at a very low pump light intensities , when the chance of more than one photon entering the fiber circuit is negligible compared to the rate single photons appear .",
    "this allows one to calculate the complete matrix of conditional probabilities @xmath82 of observing @xmath20 detector clicks with @xmath63 initial photons @xcite for one arm , and analogously @xmath83 for the second arm .",
    "the losses in the detectors and in the fiber circuit are assumed to contribute to the overall efficiencies @xmath9 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath82 and @xmath83 describe lossless loop detectors for which @xmath84 . after the calibration ,",
    "the counts are collected for approximately @xmath85 master laser pulses for each chosen intensity of the pump , which yields the probabilities @xmath86 of observing @xmath20 clicks in one arm and @xmath87 in the other one .",
    "these probabilities are related to the joint count probability @xmath35 corrected for combinatorial inefficiencies of the loop detector through the formula : @xmath88 the probabilities @xmath35 can be retrieved from experimentally measured @xmath86 using the maximum likelihood estimation technique @xcite .",
    "an exemplary joint photon number distribution reconstructed from the experimental data is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : m ] we depict the reconstructed equivalent number of modes @xmath48 in single arm for different filtering and pump intensities .",
    "this quantity can be also understood as a measure of how many incoherent modes a photon from the source occupies .",
    "naturally , @xmath48 drops with application of narrowband spectral filtering since it erases the information on the exact time the photon pair was born in the nonlinear crystal .",
    "it also is seen that @xmath48 is practically independent on the pumping intensity , as predicted in sec .",
    "[ sec : parameters ] .     as a function of the total average photon number @xmath90 , measured without interference filters ( circles ) , with 10  nm fwhm filters ( squares ) and 5  nm fwhm filters ( crosses ) . ]    the average overall efficiency of the squeezed state calculated as @xmath91 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] .",
    "it is seen that the efficiency decreases with an application of narrowband filtering , which again is easily understood .",
    "in addition , @xmath9 exhibits a very weak dependence on the pump intensity which again agrees with theoretical predictions for the regime when the average number of photons is much less than one . a relatively large difference in @xmath9 between 10  nm and 5  nm interference filters",
    "can be explained by the fact that in the latter case the selected bandwidth becomes narrower than the characteristic scale of spectral correlations within a pair .",
    "consequently , the filter in one arm selects only a fraction of photons conjugate to those that have passed through the filter placed in the second arm .",
    "this observation is consistent with the determination of the parameter @xmath92 , which shows that for 5  nm filters effectively single spectral modes are selected .     for single photon pairs as a function of the pair production rate , measured without interference filters ( circles ) , with 10 nm fwhm filters ( squares ) and 5 nm fwhm filters ( crosses ) .",

    "the parameters of the fitted theoretical curve are : @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( red dashed line ) .",
    "measurements with interference filters did not provide statistically significant data . ]    finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig:2impexp ] and [ fig:4impexp ] we plot the respective contamination parameters for single @xmath74 and double @xmath75 photon pairs , that describes non - postselectable contributions of other photon terms to the output . as expected , the contamination grows with decreasing overall efficiency @xmath9 that corresponds to narrowing the spectral bandwidth , as well as with the increasing pair production rates .",
    "it is noteworthy that the measurement results agree well with fitted theoretical curves whose parameters match those that can be read out from figs .",
    "[ fig : m ] and [ fig : eta ] .",
    "it is seen that in the regime the experiment was carried out the contamination is rather significant , and it would affect substantially effects such as two - photon interference .",
    "this limits in practice the energy of pump pulses  and consequently the production rates  that result in photon pairs sufficiently free from spurious terms .",
    "the effect is particularly dramatic in the case of @xmath75 , where genuine double pairs appear only in approximately half of all the events .",
    "despite the simplicity of the basic concept , the application of spdc sources in more complex quantum optics and quantum information processing experiments requires a careful choice of operating conditions .",
    "the actual output state is a result of a subtle interplay between the pump strength , spatial and spectral filtering of the output , and the losses experienced by the signal . in this paper we concentrated on the features of the photon number distribution and developed an effective theoretical description .",
    "starting from the fact that the spdc output processed by arbitrary passive linear optics is given by a gaussian state , we introduced effective parameters characterizing the joint photon number distribution .",
    "the first parameter is the effective number of orthogonal modes that impinge on each of the detectors .",
    "this parameter carries information about the modal purity of the photons produced in each arm .",
    "the second parameter characterizes average losses experienced by the spdc output , and can be calculated as a suitably normalized variance of the count difference .",
    "finally , we also proposed and determined experimentally a measure of the contamination of photon pairs by other spurious terms that in general can not be rejected by postselection and may contribute to an unwanted background .",
    "we showed that the presence of such a background puts stringent requirements on the detection efficiency if a bright source with high pair generation probability is desired .",
    "these constraints become very challenging when designing multiple - pair experiments .",
