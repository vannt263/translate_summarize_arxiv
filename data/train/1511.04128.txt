    "complex - valued stochastic processes are useful models for parameterizing bivariate data .",
    "such models are in widespread use in many applications including , for example , oceanography @xcite and functional magnetic resonance imaging @xcite .",
    "the theory for complex - valued representations has been developed both in the context of stochastic processes @xcite , as well as for signal processing @xcite , with notable recent developments in @xcite and @xcite . the complex - valued representation is often preferred to the bivariate representation .",
    "one reason for this is that complex - valued series can be naturally decomposed into analytic and anti - analytic components @xcite , which separates the signal based on direction of rotation in the complex plane .",
    "furthermore , complex - valued representations provide a natural framework for assessing the degree of anisotropy in a bivariate cartesian representation @xcite .",
    "the complex autoregressive process @xcite is a generalization of a real - valued autoregressive process , in which the autoregressive coefficients and noise increments are both complex - valued . in general ,",
    "the real and imaginary components of the noise are assumed to be independent and identically distributed @xcite , thus creating statistically isotropic oscillations in the time series .",
    "the process is therefore said to be _ circular _ or _ proper _ , as opposed to one that is _ elliptical _ or _ improper _ , which as we shall show , implies a statistical structure that is elliptical in geometry , see also @xcite .    in many real - world observations of complex - valued time series , elliptical or improper structure",
    "is expected to be present ; examples include seismic traces @xcite , oceanographic velocity measurements @xcite , and wind measurements @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we display a complex - valued signal from a seismic trace of the 1991 solomon islands earthquake , previously studied in @xcite and @xcite . the elliptical orbit of the time series is clear from fig .",
    "1(c ) . in cases such as these , where the time series is improper",
    ", a proper process would be a poor choice of model and would fail to summarize important characteristics of the data . in this paper",
    "we construct an improper process which is applicable to real world data such as that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "improper complex autoregressive processes have been previously proposed in @xcite and @xcite . in both of these works ,",
    "the real and imaginary noise increments of the process are correlated  a noise structure referred to as _ widely linear _ noise . the term ",
    "widely linear \" was introduced by @xcite and is used to refer to a wider form of linear dependence , in which the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 ( for example ) , is linearly related to both @xmath1 _ and _ its complex conjugate , @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite show that any second - order stationary process ( proper or improper ) can be expressed as a linear filter of widely linear noise .",
    "this result is in essence a complex - valued analogue to the well - known wold s decomposition for real - valued stationary time series @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we take a novel modelling approach for improper time series .",
    "we extend the application of wide sense linearity to the autoregressive component , by allowing the process to be related to _",
    "its own conjugate _ at the previous time - step .",
    "this approach allows us to construct a process that is order one and hence markovian , while also capturing elliptical motion of a bivariate signal , such as that seen in fig .",
    "we contrast this with the improper complex autoregressive order two process proposed in @xcite , which falls under the @xcite framework by restricting wide linearity to the noise terms .",
    "we introduce our order one process as a simpler and more intuitive model for capturing elliptical motion .",
    "the complex autoregressive process is a complex - valued discrete - time stochastic process .",
    "we denote the complex autoregressive process of order one by @xmath3 , which has three parameters , @xmath4 , and is defined for @xmath5 by @xmath6 here @xmath7 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence of complex - valued gaussian noise where the real and imaginary parts , denoted as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are independent and have zero mean and variance given by @xmath10 .",
    "the long term variance of @xmath3 is @xmath11 . if the starting value @xmath12 is a zero - mean gaussian , with variance equal to the long - term variance  i.e . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent realizations from the @xmath15 distribution  then the process is stationary for all @xmath5 if and only if @xmath16 . in such cases ,",
    "@xmath17 is commonly referred to as the damping parameter . for identifiability @xmath17",
    "is not permitted to be negative , as a negative autoregression is achieved instead when @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the angle of a rotation of the process at each time step and is usually referred to as the spin parameter .",
    "the process @xmath3 is an example of a proper process which we now define .     _ the covariance sequence , @xmath22 , and the relation sequence , @xmath23 , are defined at lag @xmath24 for a zero - mean complex - valued stationary discrete process , @xmath25 , by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes expectation and @xmath28 is the complex conjugate of @xmath25 .",
    "the process @xmath25 is said to be proper if @xmath29 and is improper otherwise .",
    "_    a proper process has a relation sequence equal to zero , and is also referred to as a _ circular _ process @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the second - order statistical properties of a proper process are isotropic , or invariant to circular rotation .",
    "for this reason proper processes can be treated much like real - valued processes .",
    "in this section we generalize the three - parameter complex autoregressive order one process to a five - parameter improper process .",
    "we first construct a more general seven - parameter process , by taking a widely linear form for both the autoregressive and noise component of the process , and then we make two parameters redundant to specify the structure of the process .",
    "the improper complex autoregressive process of order one , denoted by @xmath25 , is defined for @xmath5 by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence of complex - valued gaussian noise with variance @xmath32 and relation at lag zero specified by @xmath33 .",
    "the noise component of the process is therefore widely linear and requires three parameters , as @xmath34 is complex - valued .",
    "the remaining four parameters define an iterative relationship between the process @xmath25 with the previous value @xmath35 _ and _ its conjugate @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respective analogues of the damping parameter , @xmath39 , and the spin parameter , @xmath40 , in this widely linear setting .",
    "this novel modelling approach introduces wide linearity in the full process and not just the noise component , and will be shown to allow the process to map out elliptical oscillations .",
    "in general , the process defined in   has seven parameters . understanding the behaviour of this process is substantial in its full generality",
    "; we therefore make a simplification by equating the process to two coupled real - valued autoregressive order one processes , making two of the seven parameters in   redundant .",
    "this allows us to gain better insight and has the additional advantage that the five - parameter specification will be easier to estimate when the process is fitted to real data .",
    "we start from the complex autoregressive process of order one defined in  .",
    "we rewrite this process as a bivariate process in terms of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variables with mean 0 and variance 1 .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 is a rotation by @xmath47 in the cartesian plane .",
    "we then construct a new process @xmath48 , which we call the _ elliptical bivariate autoregressive process ( of order one ) _ , using an elliptical transformation , @xmath49 in which @xmath50 defines the orientation of the ellipse , and @xmath51 defines the eccentricity of the ellipse , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "we call this transformation  elliptical \" as it first stretches the coordinate axis , and then rotates these stretched axes through angle @xmath50 .",
    "this transformation leads to elliptical statistical properties .",
    "this can be seen by examining the @xmath54 covariance matrices associated with   and which are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the identity matrix .",
    "the covariance matrix of @xmath57 is isotropic , whereas in general the covariance matrix of @xmath48 is not .",
    "we utilize the term  elliptical structure \" to indicate that the covariance matrix of the process takes the form of an ellipse with nonzero eccentricity .",
    "this indicates that the statistics of the data exhibit anisotropy when represented in the cartesian domain .",
    "these differences are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fignew ] , which displays time series trajectories from a circular and elliptical bivariate autoregressive process .",
    "the elliptical bivariate autoregressive process of order one is defined by five parameters , namely @xmath58 .",
    "we now express the improper complex autoregressive process as @xmath59 , and in proposition  [ prop1 ] we relate the parameters of this process to those of the elliptical bivariate autoregressive process to form a five - parameter process .",
    "[ prop1 ] if the process @xmath48 is an elliptical bivariate autoregressive process of order one , as defined in   and , then it follows that @xmath60 can be represented as improper complex autoregressive process of order one specified by @xmath61 the relationship with the parameters @xmath62 in the specification of is given in table  [ tab1 ] , with the final redundant parameter , the relation at lag zero @xmath34 , specified by @xmath63     time series realizations of the bivariate autoregressive process of   in ( a ) , and the elliptical bivariate autoregressive process of   in ( b ) .",

    "this also ensures that @xmath17 , @xmath47 and @xmath100 return valid values .",
    "increasing @xmath37 therefore increases the eccentricity , until eventually larger values of @xmath37 are not valid .",

    "the ratio of the variance parameters , @xmath111 and @xmath100 , is determined by the eccentricity of the elliptical structure .",
    "the effect of each parameter can therefore be closely related row - by - row in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "finally , the phase of the complex - valued noise relation is twice the angle of the ellipse orientation @xmath50 , and its magnitude increases with increased eccentricity .    by connecting to a bivariate process",
    ", we have gained insight into a sophisticated form for a complex - valued improper process , allowing the parameters of the complex - valued process to be readily interpretable .",
    "the advantage of the complex - valued representation , is that more insight and analysis can be performed on the data , such as separating time series dependent on direction of rotation  known as the analytic and anti - analytic components @xcite  or performing hypothesis tests for impropriety @xcite .",

    "in this section we explain how the parameters of the improper complex autoregressive process of order one can be estimated from a time series in a computationally efficient manner . to avoid inversions of large covariance matrices , we use whittle s approximation to maximum likelihood @xcite , known as the ` whittle likelihood .

    "this approximation of the time - domain likelihood is in the frequency domain , and relies solely on applying fourier transforms which can be computed in @xmath124 operations .",

    "this contrasts previous work in which only the noise dependence is widely linear . as a result , our modelling approach allows improper structure in complex - valued time series to be captured more simply than alternative approaches in the literature .",
