    "the maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 4 dimensions has been a fundamental testing ground for our understanding of supersymmetric theories over the years . for instance , the scherk ",
    "schwarz supersymmetry breaking mechanism had its first application in the context of the maximal supergravity model obtained by reduction of 11-dimensional supergravity @xcite .",
    "more recently , new methods for computing loop amplitudes have been developed in the analysis of the quantum perturbative regime of the ungauged theory , building the case for its possible finiteness @xcite .",
    "finally , using the gauge / gravity correspondence , a so(8 ) gauged model @xcite with an @xmath1 vacuum has been used to analyze and study possible deformations of the so - called abjm 3-dimensional conformal theories @xcite .",
    "actually , @xmath0 supergravity in 4 dimensions comes in two main flavours : the ungauged models , realizing the maximally supersymmetric poincar algebra , and the gauged theories , where spontaneous supersymmetry breaking can occur .",
    "here we are mainly concerned with the latter .",
    "gauged supergravity models are supersymmetric deformations of the ungauged versions by a procedure that couples its vector fields to charges assigned to the other fields according to their transformation properties under the global symmetries of the starting lagrangian . from the ungauged model of cremmer ",
    "julia @xcite one can generate the so(8 ) gauged supergravity coming from m - theory compactified on the 7-dimensional sphere @xcite or the scherk ",
    "schwarz gaugings mentioned above @xcite . however , there are in general very many possible deformations with different gauge groups and also inequivalent models with the same gauge groups .",
    "a first general analysis culminated in the classification of the gaugings embedded in sl(8,@xmath2 ) @xcite , but it was soon recognized that many more models would escape such classification @xcite .",
    "there are two types of transformations one may use to generate new @xmath0 lagrangians and hence new massive deformations .",
    "the first one is electric / magnetic duality @xcite , mixing the 28 vector fields of the supergravity multiplet and the 28 magnetic duals , which obviously do not appear in the lagrangian .",
    "together they transform in the representation * 56 * of the u - duality group e@xmath3 and , although the lagrangian can not be invariant under e@xmath3 , the combined equations of motion and bianchi identities of the vector fields do transform covariantly in the representation * 56*. hence ( in the ungauged case ) the resulting theories are equivalent .",
    "in fact the rigid symmetry group of the lagrangian is generically only a subgroup of e@xmath3 and this group is not unique .",
    "the second set of transformations is related to a larger group , namely sp(56 , @xmath2 ) , which determines which gauge fields belonging to the representation * 56 * play the role of electric and which ones the role of magnetic gauge fields .",
    "this selects the so - called symplectic frame , which in turn fixes the rigid symmetry group of the ungauged lagrangian .",
    "different choices of symplectic frame yield in general different lagrangians which are not related to each other by local field redefinitions and eventually lead to different gaugings .",
    "a modern framework to treat all these issues is given by the embedding tensor formalism , introduced in @xcite and developed within the context of the maximal theory in 4 dimensions in @xcite .",
    "once the symplectic frame has been chosen and therefore the ordering of the ( electric and magnetic ) vector fields @xmath4 , @xmath5 , has been fixed , the embedding tensor @xmath6 , gives their coupling to the e@xmath3 generators @xmath7 , for instance , via covariant derivatives @xmath8 . from the general analysis of @xcite",
    "we now know that the embedding tensor is fixed by up to * 912 * parameters , as this is the only irreducible representation that survives consistency and supersymmetry constraints .",
    "using such formalism , it is now possible to proceed to a general analysis by which to classify and to construct all massive deformations of @xmath0 supergravity and possibly discuss their vacuum structure @xcite .    in a given symplectic frame",
    ", one may expect a one to one correspondence between allowed embedding tensors and gauged supergravity models . however , most of the theories that share the same gauge group are simply going to be different realizations of the same model , which can be transformed into each other by u - duality .",
    "for this reason , it is crucial to find an efficient criterion to decide whether two theories are related by such transformations , referring only to the embedding tensor . for this purpose one can use the techniques that have been developed in the context of supergravity black holes , where the construction of duality invariant quantities depending on the charges allowed to classify inequivalent solutions and to construct the corresponding duality orbits .",
    "since in the case at hand the black hole charges are replaced by gauging charges , specified by the embedding tensor , we have to find appropriate contractions of the embedding tensor that do not transform under the duality group .",
    "unfortunately , most of the simple combinations one could think of vanish due to the quadratic constraint @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sp(56 , @xmath2 ) invariant tensor , or their computation is a too demanding task , like for the two - times quartic e@xmath3 invariant constructed from both the fundamental and adjoint representations .",
    "the way out has been suggested again in the black hole context in @xcite .",
    "in fact , in order to classify duality orbits one may use covariant quantities rather than invariant ones . using covariant tensors , one may still extract quantities with constrained transformation properties , differentiating inequivalent expressions .",
    "in particular we will focus on the following quartic tensor classifier : on the upper and lower indices or @xmath11 on the mixed combinations ) , but unfortunately it is identically vanishing for the case we are interested in . ]",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the e@xmath3 quartic invariant and @xmath14 is the cartan  killing metric .",
    "the action of the duality group on ( [ btensor ] ) is non - trivial and well defined by its adjoint indices : @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that its eigenvalues are not going to change upon the application of a duality transformation and hence they can be used as duality invariant quantities , to classify different embedding tensors .",
    "the gauging of a group @xmath17 e@xmath3 requires that the embedding tensor admits at least one singlet in the decomposition of its * 912 * under e@xmath18 . for the so(8 )",
    "gauge group one sees that @xcite @xmath19 so that actually there are two possible independent tensors specifying its embedding .",
    "sl(6,@xmath2 ) decomposition of e@xmath20 contains only one singlet : @xmath21 .",
    "] in fact , in the sl(8,@xmath2 ) symplectic frame , the electric vector fields transform in the @xmath22 of @xmath23 while the magnetic ones in the @xmath24 : @xmath25 } , a_{\\mu\\,[ab]}\\}$ ] , where @xmath26 are indices labelling the fundamental representation of @xmath27(8,@xmath2 ) .",
    "the so(8 ) gauge group can be obtained by the standard choice @xcite @xmath28d},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the component of the embedding tensor in the @xmath30 , which couples the electric vectors to the sl(8,@xmath2 ) generators @xmath31 . when @xmath32 is positive definite , it defines the so(8 ) gauge group and it can be reduced to @xmath33 by an sl(8,@xmath2 ) transformation . however , we could also gauge so(8 ) by using the magnetic fields and by introducing a second tensor @xmath34 in the @xmath35 of sl(8,@xmath2 ) , so that @xcite @xmath36c},\\ ] ] and @xmath37 in order to satisfy the quadratic constraint ( [ quadconstraint ] ) .",
    "this means that , starting from the same ungauged theory , we have a one - parameter family of possible so(8 ) gauged supergravity theories , which we will call so(8)@xmath16 , depending on the ratio of the couplings ( [ thetacoupling ] ) and ( [ xicoupling ] ) .",
    "most of these models are going to be dual to each other and we can explicitly check their equivalence by using the tensor classifier ( [ btensor ] ) .    in order to simplify computations and avoid redundancies due to the remaining sl(8,@xmath2 ) invariance , we take the embedding tensor in the form : @xmath38d } , \\quad   \\theta^{ab\\,c}{}_d = c\\ , \\delta^{[a}_d \\delta_{\\vphantom{a}}^{b]c},\\ ] ] with all the other components vanishing .",
    "we can then compute the eigenvalues of the @xmath39 classifier , which are @xmath40 where @xmath41 one could still perform and overall rescaling of @xmath42 , which amounts to a simple redefinition of the coupling constant , and tune the values of such eigenvalues to obtain equivalent gaugings , but we can see that this rescaling would not affect the ratios @xmath43 .",
    "we can also see that the spectrum of these ratios is invariant under the maps @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so that we can argue that we have inequivalent gaugings for @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "in fact , at this point it is more efficient to parameterize the 1-parameter family of inequivalent gaugings by @xmath48d } , \\ \\",
    "\\theta^{ab\\,c}{}_d = \\sin \\omega\\ , \\delta^{[a}_d \\delta_{\\vphantom{a}}^{b]c},\\ ] ] so that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "hence , for @xmath51 we recover the original gauging , for @xmath52 we obtain the dual one , constructed using the magnetic vectors , and inequivalent ones come in the range @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "we remark that having different eigenvalues of the tensor @xmath39 is a _ sufficient _ condition to claim that the corresponding theories are inequivalent , because duality transformations can not change their value .    _",
    "these results imply that the so(8 ) gauged supergravity built in @xcite , also obtained as the compactification of m - theory on @xmath54 , is not unique . _",
    "all the inequivalent models discussed above have an @xmath0 vacuum with a negative cosmological constant ( which is the same in the conventions of ( [ embomega ] ) ) and obviously the quadratic spectra around such vacua coincide . however , higher order couplings change , as expected for inequivalent models .",
    "we will now show explicitly some of the so(8)@xmath16 couplings and compute their dependence on the parameter , with a special emphasis on the scalar potential , which now shows a different spectrum of vacua according to the parameter s choice .    for the sake of clarity",
    "we restrict the analysis of the potential to the g@xmath56-invariant sector of the scalar fields .",
    "it is known that for @xmath57 one finds one @xmath0 vacuum with so(8 ) symmetry , two parity conjugated vacua with @xmath58 and so(7)@xmath59 residual symmetry , another @xmath58 vacuum with so(7)@xmath60 symmetry , self - conjugated under parity , and two parity conjugated @xmath61 vacua with g@xmath56 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the g@xmath56-invariant truncation contains two scalar fields @xmath62 and the potential can be written as the sum of three pieces @xmath63 where ( in the following @xmath64 ) @xmath65      & + & \\left.\\phi_1 ^ 2 \\phi_2 ^ 2 ( 1 + 4x^4 - 106 x^8 + 4x^{12}+x^{16})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is an even function of @xmath66 and @xmath67 and symmetric in their exchange , and @xmath68      & + \\left .",
    "7 ( 1 + 6 x^4 + x^8 ) \\phi_1 ^ 2 \\phi_2 ^ 2 + 7 ( 1+x^4)^2 \\phi_2 ^ 4\\right ] ,      \\end{array}\\ ] ] which is odd in the first argument and even in the second .",
    "three symmetry operations leave the scalar potential invariant : @xmath69      \\phi_2 \\leftrightarrow - \\phi_2      \\end{array}\\right.\\ , , \\ \\",
    "\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l }      \\omega \\leftrightarrow \\omega + \\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\\\[2 mm ]      \\vec\\phi \\leftrightarrow - \\vec\\phi      \\end{array}\\right.\\ , , \\ \\",
    "\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l }      \\omega \\leftrightarrow \\omega-\\frac{\\pi}{4 } \\\\[2 mm ]      \\phi_1 \\to \\phi_2 \\\\[2 mm ]      \\phi_2 \\to -\\phi_1      \\end{array}\\right .. \\ ] ] the first one results from a parity - related symmetry , while the last two result from @xmath70-duality transformations .",
    "altogether this implies that we get inequivalent potentials only in the expected range @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "in fact , depending on the parameter @xmath71 the scalar potential exhibits a different number of vacua , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : vuoti ] .",
    "the @xmath51 case corresponds to the usual truncation of the scalar potential that keeps the so(8 ) vacuum ( although seemingly unstable , all the masses satisfy the breitenlohner ",
    "freedman bound ) , the so(7)@xmath72 vacua and the g@xmath56 ones . when @xmath73 a new so(7 ) and new g@xmath56 vacua appear .",
    "in fact , not only the number of vacua changes when @xmath73 , but also the value of their cosmological constant , as can be seen by looking at figure  [ fig : vuoti ] . in particular , we computed the ratio of the value of the cosmological constant of the various vacua in the two potentials with respect to that of the @xmath0 vacuum in the center .",
    "the result is an @xmath71-dependent function , different for each one of the vacua .    a crucial ingredient in any gauged supergravity theory is given by the expression of the shifts of the supersymmetry transformation rules . among other couplings ,",
    "they determine the fermion masses as well as the scalar potential .",
    "in particular , the gravitino shift , determining also the gravitino masses , is diagonal in the g@xmath56 truncation discussed above : @xmath74 where @xmath75,\\\\[.5em ] % \\mu_2 & = & -\\frac{1}{2|\\vec\\phi|^4 } \\left[e^{-i\\omega}\\,(\\phi_1+i\\phi_2)^2\\,{\\rm ch}^3|\\vec\\phi|\\,h_2 ^ -(\\phi_1,\\phi_2)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.e^{i\\omega}\\,|\\vec\\phi|^{-3}(\\phi_1+i\\phi_2)^5\\,{\\rm sh}^3|\\vec\\phi|\\,h_2^+(\\phi_1,-\\phi_2)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath76 & \\pm&(3+{\\rm ch}(4|\\vec\\phi|))\\,\\left(2\\phi_1 ^ 2 + 3i\\,\\phi_1\\phi_2 - 2\\phi_2 ^ 2\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath77    in the @xmath23-frame the gauge group defined by the chosen embedding tensor does not have an electric action on the vector field strengths and their duals . however , as proved in @xcite , we can always choose an electric frame for any gauging . starting from ( [ embomega ] ) , we get to the electric frame by using the symplectic rotation : @xmath78 when we perform this transformation , the kinetic terms of the vector fields and , more in general , the non - minimal couplings of the scalars to the vector fields get a non - trivial dependence on the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath79 has no effect on the so(8 ) generators but brings back the gauge connection to be electric .",
    "hence in the @xmath79-symplectic frame @xmath80 and @xmath81 are identical to the ones of @xcite .",
    "still , the couplings in ( [ g2potential])-([finaf ] ) retain their @xmath71 dependence , because the embedding of e@xmath3 in sp(56,@xmath2 ) changed and hence the explicit form of the e@xmath3 generators that are not in so(8 ) also changed .",
    "the techniques we described can be applied in full generality to any family of gaugings of maximal supergravity sharing the same gauge group . in particular",
    "most of our discussion carries over to the so@xmath82 gaugings discussed in @xcite .",
    "having a 1-parameter family of inequivalent so(8 ) gauged supergravity theories poses some interesting puzzles from both the string theory point of view as well as for the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "it is known that the compactification of m - theory on @xmath54 can be consistently truncated to the usual 4-dimensional gauged so(8 ) theory of @xcite .",
    "is there a reduction procedure leading to the so(8)@xmath16 theories ?",
    "it is clear that changing frame is related to a different choice of the fundamental vector fields remaining in the dimensional reduction process .",
    "for instance , while the electric gauge fields come from the reduction of the metric , the so(8)@xmath16 theories involve magnetic gauge fields whose higher - dimensional origin is not obvious .",
    "also , the maximal supersymmetric vacuum of the so(8 ) model provides the gravity dual to the abjm theory @xcite , but what could the extra parameter correspond to ? given that also the so(8)@xmath16 theories have an @xmath0 vacuum with the same spectrum as that of the so(8 ) model , one should expect that the deformed theories correspond to dual field theories with the same chiral ring , same 2-point functions , but different higher - point functions .",
    "actually , @xcite proposes a generalization of the abjm theories related to m2-branes probing @xmath83 , whose near - horizon limit is @xmath84 .",
    "the orbifold action is such that for @xmath85 the short supergravity spectrum remains untouched and therefore the 4-dimensional truncations would look the same at the quadratic level .",
    "furthermore , having an orbifold allows for the introduction of discrete torsion , leading to two different theories , according to the amount of discrete torsion introduced .",
    "obviously the discrete torsion is a discrete parameter and can not capture all the so(8)@xmath16 deformations , but this may well be an artifact of the classical 4-dimensional supergravity models , where we did not consider any quantization condition .",
    "the authors of @xcite propose three different models that may be related to our supergravity theories : a model with gauge group u(@xmath86)@xmath87u@xmath88 , one with gauge group u@xmath89u@xmath90 and another one with gauge group u@xmath91u@xmath92 ( and the parity - reversed u@xmath93u@xmath94 ) .",
    "the @xmath95 orbifold projection does not affect the massless spectrum and the first two models are also parity invariant .",
    "the third one is not parity invariant , but is invariant under the combination of parity and the duality transformation u@xmath96u@xmath97u@xmath98u@xmath99 , where @xmath100 is related to the @xmath101 orbifold projection and @xmath102 is the number of fractional branes . according to our previous discussion , we therefore suggest the identification @xmath103 by this relation between the parameters the first two models are identified , while the third one is invariant under the exchange of scalar fields in the representations @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this exchange is actually the result of the combined application of parity and of the duality transformation ( 4.19 ) in @xcite .",
    "we also point out that @xmath71 survives the truncation to @xmath106 and therefore it would be interesting to analyze that case , too .",
