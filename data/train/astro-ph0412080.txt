    "the universe is generally considered to have become reionised at a redshift larger than 10 .",
    "this result , coming from analysis of the wmap polarisation power spectrum ( kogut 2003 & spergel  2003 ) , came as a surprise , in the context of earlier studies of the gunn - peterson effect inferred to be present at @xmath3 ( fan , x. ,  2002 ) and of the high temperature of the intergalactic medium at @xmath4 ( theuns  2002 ; hui & haiman 2003 ) . given this result ,",
    "the ionising sources can not be known quasars or normal galaxies .",
    "rather , recourse must be had to population iii stars or to miniquasars , both of which represent hypothetical but plausible populations of the first objects in the universe , and that are significant sources of ionising photons .",
    "the impact of stellar sources have been studied by many authors ( cen 2003 , ciardi , ferrara , & white 2003 , haiman & holder 2003 , wyithe & loeb 2003 , sokasian 2003 , somerville & livio 2003 ) .",
    "these studies find in general that in order to provide enough ionising flux at or before @xmath5 for the usual scale - invariant primordial density fluctuation power spectrum , one needs population iii stars , which provide about 20 times more ionising photons per baryon than population ii ( schaerer 2002 , bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) , or an imf that initially is dominated by high mass stars ( daigne  2004 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with recent numerical simulations of the formation of first stars from primordial molecular clouds that suggest that the first metal - free stars were predominantly very massive , @xmath6 ( abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ; 2002 & bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ) .",
    "theoretically , there is some tension between the low amplitude of the fluctuations as interpreted from low redshift data (  croft 2002 , zaroubi 2004 ) and the early ionisation observed by the wmap satellite .",
    "most of the theoretical and numerical results mentioned earlier require a somewhat higher value of the fluctuation amplitude and would have a harder time satisfying all of the observational constraints with lower amplitude ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether this tension is caused by the theoretical uncertainties in the physical details of the ionisation process or it is an indication of the existence of a non - standard cosmological model in which nonlinear structures assemble earlier than in the normal @xmath8cdm scenario (  sugiyama , zaroubi & silk 2004 ; avelino & liddle 2004 ) .",
    "miniquasars have also been considered as a significant ionising source (  ricotti & ostriker 2004a ; 2004b , madau 2004 , oh 2000 , 2001 , dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "these latter are as plausible as population iii stars , whose nucleosynthetic traces have not yet been seen even in the most metal - poor halo stars nor in the high @xmath9 lyman alpha forest , in view of the correlation between central black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion ( ferrarese 2002 , gebhardt 2000 ) .",
    "this correlation demonstrates that seed black holes must have been present before spheroid formation .",
    "indeed , recent observations of a quasar host galaxy at @xmath10 ( walter et al . 2004 ) ( and other quasars ) suggest that supermassive black holes were in place and predated the formation of the spheroid .",
    "theory suggests that the seeds from which the smbh formed amounted to at least @xmath11 and were in place before @xmath12 ( islam , taylor & silk 2003 , madau & rees 2001 ) .",
    "can we distinguish between the alternative hypotheses of stellar versus miniquasar ionisation sources ?",
    "one distinguishing feature is the intrinsic source spectrum , which is thermal for stars but with a cut - off at a few times the lyman limit frequency , but power - law for miniquasars with a spectrum that extends to high energies with nearly equal logarithmic increments in energy per decade of frequency .",
    "we show here that there is a dramatic difference between these two cases in the widths of the ionisation fronts .",
    "only the miniquasar model translates to scale - dependent 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations that should be measurable by lofar .",
    "typically , the spectrum of the uv radiation of stellar sources is roughly flat with a cutoff at a few times the lyman limit frequency .",
    "this results in a very sharp transition from ionised to neutral igm .",
    "the thickness of such a region may be estimated from the mean free path of a photon with energy @xmath13 within a neutral medium , @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( bennett 2003 ) is the mean number density of hydrogen at a given redshift , and @xmath16 is the bound - free absorption cross - section for hydrogen with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . at @xmath19",
    "the mean free path for the most energetic photon from a stellar source is of the order of @xmath20 comoving kpc .",
    "in contrast , the power - law behavior of the radiation specific intensity of miniquasars produces a much thicker ionisation front . in the following calculation",
    ", we estimate this thickness assuming a uniform mass density distribution in which a miniquasar is embedded .",
    "this obviously does not take into account any mass or quasar clustering properties ; however , for the purpose of exploring the thickness to within an order of magnitude and its qualitative evolution with redshift and dependence on the black hole mass , this assumption is acceptable .",
    "a more realistic numerical calculation will be carried out in the future .",
    "we are also going to assume ionisation - recombination equilibrium .",
    "this may be safely assumed for the photons we are interested in as they have a mean free path of @xmath21 comoving mpc at redshift @xmath22 , which translates to a mean scattering time of about 0.5 - 5 million years , much less than a hubble time at the relevant redshift range .",
    "the miniquasar source spectrum is taken to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gaunt factor and @xmath25 is normalized such that the luminosity of the miniquasar is @xmath26 for black holes of mass @xmath27 with @xmath28 and the cutoff energy @xmath29 is @xmath30 ( sazonov 2004 ) .",
    "this translates to a number of ionisations at a distance @xmath31 from the source , @xmath32 with @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "the factor @xmath35 in equation  [ flux ] is added to account for the mean number of ionisations per ionising photon with @xmath36 .",
    "this last choice is a simplifying approximation to the number of ionisations per photon which has a more complex dependence on energy and ionised fraction of hydrogen ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ; dijkstra , haiman & loeb , 2004 ) .",
    "the approximation we adopt here is reasonable for photons within the energy range that gives rise to the thickness of the ionisation front ,  photons with @xmath37 .",
    "( 16,10 ) ( -3.1 , -3.5 )    ( 6.1 , -3.5 )    the cross - section quoted earlier does not take into account the presence of helium . in order to include the effect of helium ,",
    "we follow silk ( 1972 ) who modified the cross section to become @xmath38 a proper treatment of the effect of helium is accounted for by defining @xmath39 to be a step function at the two helium ionisation energies corresponding to he i and he ii .",
    "this however includes lengthy calculations and complicates the treatment , and we therefore choose @xmath39 to be a smooth function of @xmath40 an approximation that will overestimate @xmath41 for low energy photons . for photons with the relevant energy range , namely those responsible for creating the thick transition layer ,",
    "this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "the equation of ionisation equilibrium which expresses the balance between the rate of number density of ionisation and recombination events is , @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the ionisation rate per hydrogen atom for a given photon energy at distance @xmath31 from the source .",
    "since we are interested in the detailed structure of the ionisation front , @xmath44 is calculated separately for each @xmath31 using the expression , @xmath45 where we have introduced the following simplifying notation : equation  [ tau ] is written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the optical depth for photons with the lyman limit frequency at a given @xmath31 .",
    "we also changed the integration variable to @xmath48 @xmath49 is the recombination cross - section to the second excited atomic level and has the values of @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the gas temperature in units of @xmath52 assumed here to be unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the solution of equation  [ balance ] for miniquasars with various luminosities and different redshifts .",
    "the transition from neutral to ionised igm is extended and has two features .",
    "the first is a sudden steep increase in the neutral fraction with a typical width of @xmath0 comoving megaparsecs ( see left panel ) .",
    "the second feature is a wing that represents a much slower transition from @xmath53 to @xmath2 . in the next section",
    ", we will show that with lofar , one should be able to resolve both features for the luminous miniquasars .",
    "for the less luminous quasars , one might have a chance of just detecting the wing feature with lofar .",
    "only a radio telescope like ska ( the square kilometer array ) that has 10 times the total collecting area of lofar will be able to see the whole transition down to miniquasars with @xmath54 luminosity .",
    "in radio astronomy , where the rayleigh - jeans law is usually applicable , the radiation intensity , @xmath55 is expressed in terms of the brightness temperature , so that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the radiation frequency , @xmath58 is the speed of light and @xmath59 is boltzmann s constant ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "this in turn can only be detected differentially as a deviation from @xmath60 , the cosmic microwave background temperature .",
    "the predicted differential brightness temperature deviation from the cosmic microwave background radiation is given by ( field 1958 ; 1959 ; ciardi & madau 2003 ) , @xmath61^{1/2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath62 is the spin temperature and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the mass and baryon density in units of critical density . in the following calculation , we take @xmath62 to be significantly larger than @xmath60 . the enhancement in @xmath62 relative to @xmath60",
    "could be caused by the x - ray photons of the miniquasar itself or by an x - ray background produced collectively by miniquasars formed at higher redshifts ( ricotti & ostriker , 2004a ; nusser 2004 , tozzi 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , we are adopting a standard universe with a flat geometry , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "currently , there are a few experiments (  lofar , past and mwa ) that are being designed to directly measure @xmath68 of the hi 21 cm hyperfine line and probe the physics of the reionisation process by observing the neutral fraction of the igm as a function of redshift . in this study , we focus on predictions for lofar , but our conclusions could be easily applied to the other telescopes .",
    "the lofar array consists geographically of a compact core area and 45 remote stations .",
    "each remote station will be equipped with 100 high band antennas , 100 low band antennas . in the core area , with 2  km",
    "diameter , there will probably be 32 substations .",
    "for the astronomy application , there will be a total of 3200 high band and 3200 low band antennas in the core area .",
    "currently , the planned maximum baseline between the remote stations is roughly 100  km .",
    "the low band antenna will be optimised for the 30 - 80 mhz range while the high band antenna will be optimised for the 120 - 240 mhz range .",
    "the high band antennas are sensitive enough to allow for the detection of the brightness temperature produced by the high redshift @xmath69  cm transitions . in this band",
    ", lofar will have the ability to measure brightness fluctuations as low as @xmath70 mk with spectral resolution of @xmath71 and spatial resolution of about @xmath72  arcmin .",
    "as currently configured , lofar will be sensitive to the @xmath69  cm emission at redshift 6 - 11.5 over a field of 100 sq degrees .",
    "first operation is foreseen towards the end of 2006 .",
    "the resolution of lofar depends on the telescope baseline and observed wavelength .",
    "as currently designed , the epoch of ionisation signal will be sensitively measured mainly in the lofar core which has a fwhm resolution of @xmath73 arcmin . for more information ,",
    "see the lofar web site : www.lofar.org    ( 16,10 . )",
    "( -3.1 , -3.5 )    ( 6.1 , -3.5 )    here we have convolved the predicted brightness temperature fluctuations with the lofar beam , taking a gaussian beam of fwhm 3 arcmin , and obtained the results shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this figure shows the expected lofar observed differential brightness temperature for various values of redshifts with fixed central black hole mass of @xmath74 ( left panel ) and for different values of black hole masses with fixed redshift ( right panel ) .",
    "it is clear that the ionisation front for the @xmath75 case is larger than the beam fwhm and could be easily observed with lofar .",
    "however , this is not the case for a miniquasar with central black hole mass @xmath76 .",
    "the lofar baseline will allow higher resolution observations but for those baselines the collecting area of the telescope with respect to the core increases very little ,  a baseline of @xmath70  km has about 1.2 the core collecting area , resulting in a sharp decrease in the telescope sensitivity at these resolutions . to fully resolve such ionisation fronts , one would have to wait ,  for the square kilometer array which for the same baseline has an order of magnitude higher sensitivity than lofar .",
    "the extended wings of the ionised region shown in figures  [ fig : fig1 ] &  [ fig : fig2 ] could also be observed with lofar , possibly even for the low power miniquasars .",
    "these correspond to a small but not negligible ionised fraction ( @xmath77 ) with a @xmath68 of the order of a few .",
    "the extended region of these low ionisation wings compensates for their low signal and might possibly render them observable with lofar .",
    "in this paper we have shown that for very simple assumptions , lofar could in principle indicate whether a certain ionisation front is caused by miniquasars or stars by measuring its width .",
    "our assumptions include a single spherical symmetric ionisation source with no overlapping ionised spheres , a single ionising population and a homogeneous background with no clustering . in the future",
    ", we will include the source clustering effects and the effects of the source luminosity function , and compute the lofar correlation function .    in reality , however , the reionisation process might have been much more complex and have been induced by multiple types of ionisation radiation sources that were dominant at various stages of the universe history and present in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "for example , massive population iii stars might die early on and create miniquasars that can maintain the igm to be partially ionised through their hard photons ( ricotti & ostriker 2004a ; 2004b ; madau  2004 ) while the full ionisation could be attributed to the soft miniquasar photons at later stages .",
    "notwithstanding the complex ionisation history of the igm , the thickness of the ionisation fronts expected to be observed via the 21 cm experiments lofar and past ( peterson , pen and wu , 2004 ) should still be a very strong discriminator between stellar and accreting black hole ionising radiation sources .",
