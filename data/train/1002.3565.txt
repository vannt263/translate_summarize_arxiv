    "in the last years a focused ion beam ( fib ) of ga@xmath0-ions for etching @xcite has attracted the attention of the community as an alternative and flexible method to produce micro- and nanostructures of materials , especially where the use of conventional methods appears to be limited .",
    "this fib technique has been successfully used for nanostructuring different materials like magnetic and superconducting @xcite or more recently to study the conduction behavior in metallic constrictions @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this technique is its versatility ; the use of any resist appears , a priory , unnecessary .",
    "nowadays , fib devices are also used for deposition of metallic or insulating materials with the help of the same ga@xmath0-ions .",
    "these ions induce a decomposition of a chemical metal precursor over the surface in question , a technique called ion - beam induced or assisted deposition ( ibid , ibad ) @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of ibid / ebid is the deposition of the desired patterns of a material without the need of a mask or a pre - structured pattern using optical or e - beam lithography ( ebl ) .",
    "also the possibility to modify only parts of the patterns in electronic devices within nanometer dimensions is other of the fib advantages .",
    "the modification of different properties of different materials has been studied in the past , as e.g. in magnetic la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 thin films @xcite or co / pt multilayers @xcite . however ,",
    "a fundamental problem of fib was less discussed in literature , namely the modification of the sample near surface region and to a certain extent also its interior and their influence in the transport properties by the use of ga@xmath0ions of energies up to 30  kev and fluences below @xmath4  @xmath5 in usual devices .",
    "we note that before cutting or depositing material , the use of fib requires the precise alignment of the ga - beam and this is done taking a picture of the region in question irradiating it with the same ga@xmath0-ions . depending on the surface properties of the material in question , in general ga@xmath0 fluences @xmath6@xmath5",
    "as we demonstrate below , these ga@xmath0-fluences necessary for the first alignment may already affect seriously the intrinsic properties of the material of interest and can lead to wrong interpretations of the effects that a reduction of the sample geometry may produce .",
    "the influence of ga irradiation during the fib preparation processes was not yet quantitatively studied , neither in situ nor after irradiation for fluences below @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "specially when materials are selected to investigate their transport properties while their size is being reduced , care should be taken since the electrical transport can be sensitive to lattice defects as well as to the produced ga contamination .",
    "the aim of this paper is to report on the changes in the electrical resistivity measured in - situ and its temperature @xmath7 and magnetic field @xmath8 dependence after irradiation of three different thin film materials to show the influence of the ga irradiation used in fib devices and at fluences as low as the ones used for beam alignment .",
    "the experiments were realized in two stages . in the first stage",
    "we have done in - situ measurements of the electrical resistance during irradiation and in the second stage its resistance was measured as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 to compare with the corresponding virgin states . using graphite as a test material because its electrical resistance is extremely sensitive to lattice defects @xcite , we provide in this work a possible solution that can be used to strongly diminish the effects due to the ga@xmath0-irradiation on different materials .",

    "the resistance of the covered part remains unchanged within @xmath15 relative change indicating that the 300  nm thick resist was enough to stop the ga@xmath0-ions as expected since according the srim calculations the maximal penetration of the ga@xmath0-ions in the resist should be @xmath16 nm . immediately after irradiation the resistance of the uncovered",

    "the temperature dependence in the as - prepared state has a semiconducting behavior above 50  k and metallic below .",
    "the semiconducting behavior is mainly due to the increase in carrier concentration with temperature because most of the carriers are thermally activated and the fermi energy increases linearly with temperature @xcite .",
    "the metallic behavior below 50  k is not intrinsic of graphite but comes from internal interfaces between crystalline regions parallel to the graphene layers but of slightly different orientation@xcite .",
    "the mentioned interfaces originate during the pyrolysis process @xcite .",
    "the first irradiation increased the resistance in all the temperature range without changing strongly the relative change with temperature , see fig .",
    "[ rtgra ] .",
    "the metallic part was shifted to below 25  k and its @xmath7-dependence gets weaker , suggesting that the irradiation also affected the properties of the internal interface(s ) . after the second irradiation the metallic region vanishes completely and the resistance decreases rather linearly with @xmath7 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ rtgra ] .",
    "we note that the absolute value of the resistance is fairly proportional to the used fluence . between the virgin state and first irradiation we have an increase in the resistance of a factor of 3.5 .",
    "doubling the fluence we expect an increase of a factor @xmath21 of the resistance of the as - received state , a factor in agreement with the experimental observation .",
    "as shown in @xcite the increase in resistance is due to the decrease in the mean free path that overwhelms the increase in the carrier density that these irradiations produce inside the graphite structure .",
    "this behavior is related to difference weights the carrier density @xmath22 and the mean free path @xmath23 have in the 2d resistivity , i.e. @xmath24 in contrast with the 3d resistivity equation @xmath25 .",
    "note also that the second irradiation produces already a vacancy density that implies a vacancy distance of less than 2  nm in the graphene plane . at distances",
    "smaller than @xmath26 nm we do not expect a large increase in the carrier density with further irradiation @xcite .",
    "figure  [ mrgra ] shows the magnetoresistance ( mr ) vs. applied field at different constant temperatures for the graphite sample in the virgin ( a ) , first ( b ) and second ( c ) irradiated state .",
    "the mr in the virgin state agrees with previous reports @xcite .",
    "note that the mr shows a quasi linear field behavior at low temperatures .",
    "also anomalous is the systematic increase of the mr below 100  k. this is related to the decrease in the resistance with decreasing temperature , see fig .",
    "[ rtgra ] .",
    "the mr reaches a value of 16 at 8  t and 2  k. after the first irradiation the mr decreased a factor 16 and remains practically temperature independent .",
    "after the second irradiation the mr decreased further a factor of 6 and shows a similar temperature independence .",
    "the data reveal that the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations increase their amplitude and start to be measurable at lower fields after the first irradiation @xcite .",
    "this behavior is related to the increase in the carrier density due to the creation of defects , whereas the decrease in the mr is due to the decrease in the mean free path .",

    "we observe the first low - field oscillation at a similar field and a similar oscillation period in reciprocal field as after the first irradiation , see fig .",
    "these results indicate that no further change in the carrier density has been produced for a vacancy distance less than 2  nm . taking into account that 3  nm is of the order of the range of modification of the electronic structure produced by , e.g. a single vacancy @xcite , then a saturation of the carrier density is reached decreasing the vacancy distance below @xmath27 nm but keeping the graphene structure .",

    "these results indicate that care should be taken when changes in the transport properties of ferromagnetic oxides are observed after microstructuring the samples with fib .",
