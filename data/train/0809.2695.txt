    "quasi - periodic oscillations in black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) have become a very active research field since the launch of the nasa satellite _ rxte _ ( bradt et al .",
    "one of the remarkable features in bhxbs is that the high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) could appear in pairs with the puzzling commensurate frequencies , which have been observed in gro j1655 - 40 ( 450 , 300hz ; remillard et al .",

    "2002 , hereafter r02 ) , xte j1550 - 564 ( 276 , 184 , 92hz ; miller et al . 2001 ; r02 ) and grs 1915 + 105 ( 168 , 113 , 67 , 41hz ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 , hereafter mr06 and rm06 , respectively ) .",
    "the above hfqpos appear in pairs with the 3:2 ratio of the higher frequency to the lower frequency ( henceforth 3:2 hfqpo pairs ) , e.g. 276 vs 184hz and 450 vs 300hz occur in xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 , respectively , while two 3:2 hfqpo pairs , 168 vs 113hz and 67 vs 41hz , appear in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "a number of models have been proposed to explain the origin of hfqpo pairs in bhxbs .",
    "strohmayer ( 2001a , 2001b ) investigated combinations of the azimuthal and radial coordinate frequencies in general relativity to explain the hfqpo pairs in gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "wagoner et al . ( 2001 ) regarded the hfqpo pairs as fundamental g - mode and c - mode discoseismic oscillations in a relativistic accretion disc .",
    "very recently , silbergleit & wagoner ( 2007 ) discussed the corotation resonance and diskoseismology modes of black hole ( bh ) accretion discs and suggested that the hfqpo pairs may relate to the excitation of two ( groups of ) g - modes of discoseismic oscillations .",
    "abramowicz & kluzniak ( 2001 ) explained the pairs in gro j1655 - 40 as a resonance between orbital and epicyclic motion of accreting matter .",
    "recently , the resonance model is presented in a more realistic context , in which `` parametric resonance '' concept is introduced to describe the oscillations rooted in fluid flow where there is a coupling between the radial and polar coordinate frequencies ( abramowicz et al .",
    "2003 ; kluzniak et al .",
    "2004 ; trk et al .",
    "as argued by van der klis ( 2000 , 2006 ) , hfqpos in x - ray binaries probably originate from the inner edge of an accretion disc around a neutron star or a stellar - mass bh , since millisecond is the natural timescale for accretion process in these regions .    on the other hand ,",
    "wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented the first xmm - newton observation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , and they found a broad fe disc line from the observed spectrum .",
    "however , no quasi - periodic oscillations have been detected in this source .",
    "a very steep emissivity index ( @xmath0 ) from the inner accretion disc is required for fitting the broad fe k emission line , which is difficult to be explained within the framework of a standard accretion disc ( sad ) .",
    "wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that the magnetic extraction of rotational energy from a spinning black hole should be invoked to create this steep emissivity .",
    "the relativistic disc lines for microquasars have been analyzed by some authors , e.g. , xte j1550 - 564 by sobczak et al .",

    "however , the steep emissivity indexes required by broad fe k @xmath1 lines were hardly worked out except a few cases , such as , @xmath2 for gx 339 - 4 in the very high state , and @xmath3 for xte j1650 - 500 based on the observation of xmm - newton . a detailed review for relativistic x - ray emission lines from the inner accretion disc around black holes for agns and stellar - mass black holes are given by miller ( 2007 ) .    with the existence of a magnetic field connecting a rotating black hole to its surrounding disc , energy and angular momentum",
    "can be transferred from the black hole to the disc , and this energy mechanism is referred to as the mc process , which is regarded as one of the variants of the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process ( blandford & znajek 1977 , 1999 ; li 2000 , 2002 , hereafter l02 , wang 2002 ) .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003a , hereafter w03a ) incorporated the bz and mc processes into black hole accretion disc , and henceforth this model is referred to as mc - i model , which was used to interpret the very steep emissivity index required by the observation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "in addition , wang et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter w05 ) suggested that the 3:2 hfqpo pairs observed in the above bhxbs can be fitted by virtue of two hotspots in the inner disc , which are produced by the non - axisymmetric mc process",
    ".    the fatal shortcoming of mc - i model is that the fits of the 3:2 hfqpo pairs always accompany jets , which is driven by the bz process . as reviewed in mr06 and rm06 ,",
    "jets are generally observed in the hard state of bhxbs , while hfqpos are always detected in the steep power - law ( spl ) state .",
    "thus the fits of the 3:2 hfqpo pairs based on mc - i model are inconsistent with the observations .    based on a careful analysis of the 1998 - 1999 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 and the 1996 - 1997 outburst of gro j1655 - 40 some interesting features",
    "have been found in r02 , the 3:2 hfqpo pairs could be detected simultaneously in the spl state , and a systematic shift away from disc dominated flux with the increasing power - law flux is detected as the hfqpo pairs shift from 276 to 184 hz for xte j1550 - 564 and from 450 to 300 hz for gro j1655 - 40 as shown in figs . 5 and 7 of r02 , respectively .",
    "in addition , remillard ( 2004 ) noted that the broad fe k emission lines can be also detected in the spl state in xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "these results imply that the fe k lines could be detected simultaneously with the 3:2 hfqpo pairs in these two sources .",
    "+ in this paper , we interpret the 3:2 hfqpo pairs associated with the broad fe k line in xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 by modifying mc - i model in two aspects .",
    "( 1 ) the open field lines corresponding to the bz process is removed , and ( 2 ) a non - zero torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc is introduced .",
    "henceforth the modified model is referred to as mc - ii model .",
    "it turns out that the 3:2 hfqpo pairs observed in the two sources can be fitted by tuning several model parameters , such as the bh spin , and the main features of mc - ii model lie in the following aspects : ( 1 ) the condition for only one hfqpo is discussed based on the two mechanisms for producing the 3:2 hfqpo pairs .",
    "( 2 ) an explanation is given for a systematic shift away from disc dominated flux with the increasing power - law flux as the hfqpo pairs shift from the higher to lower frequencies , which is consistent with the analysis given by r02 .",
    "( 3 ) the bh spin in xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 can be estimated by combining the 3:2 hfqpo pairs with the very steep emissivity index required for fitting the broad fe k emission line .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present a detailed description of mc - ii model , in which the main differences between mc - i and mc - ii models are outlined . in ",
    "3 we describe the elements for fitting the 3:2 hfqpo pairs observed in xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 , and present the calculation sequence and results based on mc - ii model .",
    "we discuss the possible correlation of the 3:2 hfqpo pairs with the very steep emissivity index required by broad fe k @xmath1 lines .",
    "it is expected that the 3:2 hfqpo pairs could be observed with the steep emissivity index , and the black hole spin could be estimated once the value ranges of the index are determined in the future observations .",
    "finally , we discuss some issues related to mc - ii model in  4 .    throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath4 are used .",
    "in this section we present a detailed description of mc - ii model based on the following assumptions .",
    "\\(1 ) the accretion disc is perfectly conducting , and the closed magnetic field lines are frozen in the disc . the disc is thin and relativistic , lying in the equatorial plane of a kerr black hole .",
    "\\(2 ) corona is introduced , which consists of tenuous hot plasma above the disc surface as shown in figure 1 .",
    "both large- and small - scale magnetic fields are involved in mc - ii model , in which the large - scale magnetic field plays a key role in transferring energy and angular momentum from a fast - rotating black hole to its surrounding disc in the mc process , while the small - scale magnetic field energizes the corona above the disc by virtue of some physical processes , such as magnetic reconnection and buoyancy ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the existence of corona can improve the fitting of the output spectra from the bhxbs , which is helpful to interpret the x - ray radiation observed in the spl state ( ma et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the large - scale magnetic field is assumed to be non - axisymmetric as described by wang et al .",
    "( 2003b , hereafter w03b ) .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field is assumed to be constant on the black hole horizon , and it varies as a power law with disc radius , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "\\(4 ) one of the main differences between mc - i and mc - ii models lies in the fact that `` no torque boundary condition '' is assumed in mc - i model as given in sad ( novikov & thorne 1973 , hereafter nt73 ; page & thorne 1974 ) , while a nonzero torque is exerted at the inner edge of the disc in mc - ii model .",
    "this torque arises from the magnetic connection of the matter in the plunging region with the matter in the inner disc as argued by some authors ( livio , ogilivie & pringle 1999 , hereafter l99 ; krolik 1999 ; gammie 1999 ; agol & krolik 2000 ) .",
    "\\(5 ) another difference between the two models lies in the fact that the open field lines are removed from mc - ii model , while the closed field lines connecting the black hole with its surrounding accretion disc are retained , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "so only the mc process rather than the bz process can work in mc - ii model .",
    "the reason for the modification of the magnetic field configurations lies in two points .",
    "\\(i ) the existence of the closed field lines depends upon the mapping relation with the conservation of the magnetic flux as argued in w03a , being not the sufficient condition for the existence of the open field lines at the horizon .",
    "\\(ii ) the second reason is more important , i.e. , the 3:2 hfqpo pairs are observed in the spl state , in which no jets are observed .",
    "thus the magnetic field configuration depicted in figure 1 is more consistent with the observations . + in order to illustrate the elements for interpreting the 3:2 hfqpo pairs we derive the radiation flux from the accretion disc based on mc - ii model . according to the conservation of energy and angular momentum we have the following relations given in l02 and w03a ,    @xmath6    in equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "@xmath7 is the accretion rate .",
    "the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the interior viscous torque in the disc and the flux of angular momentum transferred between the black hole and the disc in the mc process , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the specific energy and angular momentum of the disc matter , being given in nt73 as follows ( where @xmath12 ) ,    @xmath13    @xmath14    by resolving equation ( [ eq1 ] ) we derive the total radiation flux @xmath15 and the interior viscous torque @xmath8 in the disc as follows ,    @xmath16    @xmath17    in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the radiation fluxes contributed by the disc accretion and the mc process , and @xmath20 is the extra contribution due to the exterior torque exerted at the inner edge , and @xmath21 is the angular velocity of the relativistic thin disc and it reads    @xmath22    in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) the parameter @xmath23 is the black hole spin , which is defined in terms of the black hole mass @xmath24 and angular momentum @xmath25 , and the parameter @xmath26 is related to the disc radius by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is defined in terms of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco , nt73 ) .",
    "the three parts of @xmath15 are expressed as follows ,    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the angular velocity at @xmath33 , other terms with subscripts `` _ _ in _ _ '' are taken their values at @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath9 in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) is related to the mc torque by @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the mc torque due to non - axisymmetric magnetic field and it reads ( w03b )    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the mc torque due to axisymmetric magnetic field , being expressed in w03a as    @xmath38    the parameter @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) is used to indicate the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath35 as described in w03b , and @xmath40 is the ratio of the angular velocity of the disc to that of the black hole .",
    "it is easy to check by using equation ( [ eq4 ] ) that @xmath41 always holds for a fast - spinning black hole with @xmath42 , implying that energy and angular momentum are transferred from the black hole to the inner disc in the mc process .    since the magnetic field on the black hole",
    "is supported by the surrounding disc , there is some relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "one possibility has been suggested by moderski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which is based upon the balance between the pressure of the magnetic field on the horizon and the ram pressure of the innermost parts of an accretion flow , i.e. ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the radius of the black hole horizon . considering that equation ( [ eq12 ] ) is not a certain relation between @xmath43 and @xmath7 , we rewrite it as follows ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a parameter to adjust the accretion rate @xmath49 .    inspecting equation ( [ eq7 ] )",

    "if the magnetic pressure inside isco is strong enough , a radial force can be exerted at the inner edge of the disc due to the magnetic connection , resulting in an outward displacement of the inner edge from @xmath66 to @xmath33 .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic torque @xmath50 exerted at @xmath33 is determined by the following equations ,    @xmath67\\dot { m}_d , \\ ] ]    where @xmath68 is the power of the magnetic torque , and @xmath69 is the fraction of the power keeping the inner edge at @xmath33 .",
    "considering the fact that the accretion disc is perfectly conducting , and the closed magnetic field lines are frozen in the disc , and the inner and outer hotspots are produced by non - axisymmetric magnetic field , we infer that these hotspots rotate with the angular velocity of the disc , and the upper and lower frequencies of the 3:2 hfqpo pairs can be expressed by    @xmath70    where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the black hole mass in terms of one solar mass .",
    "equation ( [ eq21 ] ) can be derived directly from equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the lower frequency @xmath73 of the hfqpo pair is produced by the outer hotspot , which is located at the outer boundary of the mc region as shown in figure 1 . according to the kruskal - shafranov criterion ,",
    "the screw instability of the large - scale magnetic field will occur , if the magnetic field line turns around itself about once ( kadomtsev 1966 ; bateman 1978 ) .",
    "based on the kruskal - shafranov criterion the radius @xmath74 can be determined by the following equation ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ) ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field on the disc , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 are respectively the poloidal length of the field line and the cylindrical radius on the disc , and the latter reads    @xmath80    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the kerr metric parameters ( novikov & thorns 1973 ) .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) expressed equation ( [ eq22 ] ) in terms of the parameters involved in the mc process as follows ,    @xmath83    the equality in equation ( [ eq24 ] ) corresponds to the screw instability , and @xmath84 is a function of the parameters , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and it reads    @xmath88}{2a _ * \\left ( { 1 - \\beta _ \\omega } \\right)}\\sqrt { \\frac{1 + a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 4 } \\xi ^ { - 2 } + 2a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 6 } \\xi ^ { - 3}}{1 + a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 4 } + 2a _ * ^2 \\chi _ { ms}^ { - 6 } } } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath89 is a function of the black hole spin .",
    "thus the position of the outer hotspot can be determined by the criterion ( [ eq24 ] ) for the given @xmath85 and @xmath87 .",
    "the upper frequency @xmath90 of the hfqpo pair is produced by the inner hotspot , of which the position is determined by the maximum of the following function ,    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is defined as a unit of the radiation flux , and @xmath93 is the magnetic field in terms of @xmath94 .",
    "the emissivity index can be calculated from the total radiation flux @xmath15 based on the definition as follows ,    @xmath95    incorporating equations ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) , we obtain the emissivity index @xmath96 by calculating the following contributions ,    @xmath97    where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are contributed by the disc accretion , the mc process and the magnetic torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc , respectively .    based on equations ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq28 ] ) we obtain the curves of the above contributions to the total radiation flux and the emissivity index versus the disc radius for xte j1550 - 564 with @xmath101 as shown in figure 2a and 2b , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure 2 the contributions of the disc accretion and the mc process to the total radiation flux and the emissivity index are more than two orders of magnitude less than those due to the magnetic torque at the inner edge of the disc , and both the total radiation flux @xmath15 and the emissivity index @xmath102 take their maxima at @xmath33 .",

    "\\(1 ) for a given black hole mass , a bigger spin corresponds to a smaller emissivity index @xmath102 and a smaller parameter @xmath87 , but to a bigger parameter @xmath69 . for a given black hole spin",
    ", a bigger black hole mass corresponds to a bigger @xmath102 , while the parameters @xmath87 and _ @xmath69 _ are insensitive to the variation of the black hole mass .",
    "this result can be understood based on black hole physics ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "the width of the plunging region decreases monotonically with the increasing black hole spin , so the effects of the magnetic torque in the plunging region decreases with the increasing black hole spin .",
    "\\(2 ) the black hole spin could be estimated , if the value range of the emissivity index can be determined by the future observations .",
    "as shown by the shaded regions in figures 3a and 4a , the black hole spin could be constrained in the range of @xmath117 with the emissivity indexes in the ranges of @xmath118 and @xmath119 for xte j1650 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 , respectively .",
    "as pointed out in rm06 , hfqpos are likely to offer the most reliable measurement of bh spins once the correct model is known .",
    "the observations involved hfqpos are very complicated , behaving multiple features in different sources , and a variety of mechanisms and models are invoked to fit the hfqpos in bhxbs .",
    "the model of the mc process with a nonzero torque exerted at the inner edge of accretion disc provides an interpretation for the association of the 3:2 hfqpo pairs with the broad fe k line , and it could be a possible approach to the bh spins of the binaries in the galaxy .",
    "in this paper , association of the 3:2 hfqpo pairs with the broad fe k line in xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 is discussed based on mc - ii model .",
    "it is shown that the 3:2 hfqpo pairs observed in the two sources can be fitted with the observational constraints by tuning several model parameters .",
    "some related issues are given as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) it is noted that the mechanisms of creating the two hotspots are different : the inner one is produced predominantly by the magnetic torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc , while the outer one arises from the screw instability of the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "it is helpful to imagine the magnetic field line as an elastic string .",
    "the rotating bh twists the field line , while the field line tries to untwist itself .",
    "once the toroidal component of the magnetic field is strong enough to satisfy the criterion , the screw instability will occurs , just as a twisted elastic string releases its energy under appropriate conditions .",
    "\\(2 ) some authors argued that the coronal heating in some stars including the sun is probably related to dissipation of currents , and very strong x - ray emissions arise from variation of magnetic fields ( galsgaard & parnell 2004 ; peter et al .",
    "analogously , if the corona exists above the disc in mc - ii model , we expect that the corona above @xmath108 might be heated by the induced current due to the screw instability of the non - axisymmetric magnetic field .",
    "thus the ratio of the disc bolometric flux to the power - law flux is greater for the inner hotspot than that for the outer hotspot , and the feature of x - ray radiation given by r02 can be interpreted based on mc - ii model with corona , i.e. , there exists a systematic shift away from disc dominated flux with the increasing power - law flux as the hfqpo pairs shift from the higher frequency to the lower frequency based on the observations of xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "\\(3 ) since the two hotspots are produced by two different mechanisms , we can explain the observations that hfqpos do not always appear in simultaneous pairs , because the condition for the magnetic torque and that for the screw instability would not be satisfied at the same time . since the inner and outer hotspots are related to two different mechanisms based on the non - axisymmetric magnetic fields in the plunging region and the bh horizon , either the fluctuations of the magnetic fields at different position or the criterion of the screw instability could affect the hfqpo pairs .",
    "unfortunately , we can not discuss this issue in a quantitative way due to the unknown origin of the magnetic field near the bh .",
    "\\(4 ) according to equation ( 21 ) the hfqpo frequency is inversely proportional to the bh mass , which providers a strong limit to the fits",
    ". we can neither fit the hfqpo with 92 hz in xte j1550 - 564 nor the 3:2 hfqpo pair ( 67 , 41hz ) in grs 1915 + 105 based on equation ( 21 ) for the measured bh masses .",
    "furthermore , the 3:2 hfqpo pair ( 168 , 113hz ) of grs 1915 + 105 are not fitted , because a systematic shift away from disc dominated flux with the increasing power - law flux as the hfqpo pair shift from the higher frequency to the lower frequency has not been observed in this source .",
    "\\(5 ) as argued above , the higher and lower hfqpo frequencies are related to the inner and outer hotspots rotating with the angular velocity located at @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . according to equation ( 21 ) the hfqpo frequencies are inversely proportional to the bh mass , and the spin",
    "is related to the hfqpo frequencies via @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where the hfqpo frequencies are calculated by the angular velocity . since the evolution time scale of the bh mass and spin are much longer than the observation time scale , the two quantities are considered fixed in calculations .",
    "\\(6 ) as pointed out in r02 , the 3:2 hfqpo pairs could have a small , but significant , change in frequency .",
    "for example , the hfqpo frequencies observed in xte j1550 - 564 deviate from 274 hz and 184 hz during different outbursts .",
    "these small deviations in hfqpo frequencies can be calculated by resolving * fie * with the adjustable parameters @xmath87 and @xmath114 as shown in table 2 .",
    "\\(7 ) as argued above , both the non - axisymmetric magnetic field configuration and the corona above the disc surface are required for interpreting the 3:2 hfqpo pairs observed in the spl state of the bhxbs .",
    "thus we can interpret the observation that sometimes the 3:2 hfqpo pairs can not be observed in the spl state , if the magnetic field configuration is axisymmetric .",
    "based on the same reason we predict that the 3:2 hfqpo pairs could be observed with the very steep emissivity index , if the magnetic field configuration is non - axisymmetric .",
    "however , the hfqpo pairs can not be produced with the emissivity index for the axisymmetric magnetic field configuration .",
    "\\(8 ) according to @xmath120 the ratio of the magnetic field at @xmath108 to that at @xmath107 can be written as @xmath121 .",
    "based on * fie * we have the curves of @xmath122 for xte j1650 - 564 vary with @xmath115 as shown in figure 5 , from which a strongly constraint to the bh spin can be found .",
    "the bh spin should be very high , or at least greater than some intermediate value to avoid the magnetic field at @xmath108 too low to produce an outer hotspot .",
    "\\(9 ) there is less certain evidence that the same 3:2 ratio occurs for qpos observed in low - mass active galactic nuclei , sgr a@xmath123 , ( trk 2005a , b ; ashenbach 2004a , b ) and in a few nearby seyferts ( lachowicz et al .",
    "mc - ii model can be used to fit qpos pairs observed in the super - massive bh systems , and we obtain the curves of the emissivity index @xmath116 , the power - law index @xmath87 and the parameter @xmath114 varying with the bh spin of for sgr a@xmath123 as shown in figure 6 .",
    "we can find from figure 6 that the parameter n varies from 4.272 to 7.108 with @xmath115 decreasing from 0.998 to 0.853 for @xmath124 , while it varies from 5.040 to 10.239 with @xmath115 decreasing from 0.998 to 0.555 for @xmath125 .",
    "\\(10 ) the parameter @xmath87 is used to indicate the variation of the large - scale magnetic field with the disc radius , which is a key parameter for fitting the 3:2 frequency ratio .",
    "based on * fie * we have the variation of the 3:2 frequency ratio with the parameter",
    "n for the given values of the bh spin as shown in figure 7 .",
    "* inspecting figure 7 , we find that the frequency ratio decreases monotonically with the increasing parameter @xmath87 .",
    "the greater @xmath87 corresponds to the less ratio for the given spin , and the greater spin corresponds to both the less value and less variation of @xmath87 for the given ratio . for xte j1550 - 564 ,",
    "e.g. , the ratio increases about 5.7% as the value of @xmath87 decreases about 10% for @xmath126 , while the same variation occurs as @xmath87 only decreases about 1.9% for @xmath127 .",
    "this result implies that the observed 3:2 frequency ratio is reached for a very narrow range of @xmath87 with the greater bh spin . *",
    "( * 11 * ) finally , we discuss the values of the parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which are used to indicate the disc thickness at @xmath107 and the strength of the accretion rate , respectively .",
    "the emissivity index of xte j1550 - 564 varies with the bh spin for different values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 are shown in figure * 8*.    inspecting figure * 8a * , we find that the values of the emissivity index are insensitive to the values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , provided that they are limited to @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "these value ranges are reasonable for thin accretion disc in mc - ii model .",
    "in addition , based on the features of mc - ii model , the 3:2 hfqpo pairs are also insensitive to the parameters with the above limited values .",
