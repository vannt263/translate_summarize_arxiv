    "wz sge - type stars are an extreme subclass of dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the origin of unique light variations , as well as their evolutionary status , are still in debate ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "their observational properties are that ( 1 ) the amplitude of the superoutburst is large , exceeding @xmath0 6 mag @xcite , ( 2 ) the interval between the successive superoutbursts ( supercycle ) is unusually long , typically with a time scale of decades @xcite , ( 3 ) modulations with double - peaked profiles called early superhumps are observed in the early phase of the superoutburst @xcite , and ( 4 ) after the end of the plateau stage , single or multiple rebrightenings are observed @xcite . among them , properties ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are considered to be unique to wz sge - type dwarf novae and to be the defining characteristics ( see @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    ", our understanding on su uma - type and wz sge - type dwarf novae has been improved by using extensive photometric data obtained by ground - based and space telescopes .",
    "@xcite studied superhump period changes and concluded that the @xmath3 diagram of superhump maximum timings is composed of three stages : stage a in which @xmath1 ( the superhump period ) is long and constant , stage b in which @xmath1 changes as the superoutburst proceeds , and stage c in which @xmath1 is short and constant . also , @xcite classified rebrightenings into five types according to the profiles of the light curves .",
    "the rebrightening type includes type - a ( long duration rebrightening ) , type - b ( multiple rebrightenings ) , type - c ( single rebrightening ) , type - d ( no rebrightening ) , and type - e ( double superoutbursts ) .",
    "most recently , @xcite published a comprehensive review of wz sge - type dwarf novae , in which he suggested that period derivative of superhumps and rebrightening type reflect the evolutional sequence of the system .    in the case of wz sge - type stars ,",
    "no precursor outburst had been observed , while precursors have been observed in almost all of ordinary su uma - type stars except for large - amplitude , rarely outbursting objects . in ordinary su uma - type stars ,",
    "the disk radius exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius at the onset of their superoutbursts .",
    "it takes one or two days for the tidal instability to grow up .",
    "hence , the cooling wave propagates in the disk until the tidal instability fully develops . in the meantime ,",
    "the brightness gradually decreases like normal outbursts . after the disk becomes eccentric , starting a superoutburst , the brightness rapidly increases @xcite .",
    "however , in wz sge - type stars , the mass stored in quiescence is large and the cooling front does not propagate before appearance of superhumps @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why the light curves on wz sge - type stars had shown no precursors .",
    "al com is one of the best known wz sge - type dwarf novae , and sometimes called `` a perfect twin '' of wz sge itself .",
    "the wz sge nature of the system in the modern sense was first elucidated by @xcite , who detected early and ordinary superhumps having periods of @xmath4 = 0.05666(2 ) d and @xmath1 = 0.05722(10 ) d , respectively , during the 1995 superoutburst .",
    "the 1995 superoutburst was studied by many astronomers .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath5 and @xmath6 photometry and derived a positive @xmath7 ; the time derivative of the superhump period ) , together with a hint of the presence of stage a and c. @xcite pointed out that the mass of the secondary star might be below 0.04 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite studied superhump period changes using extensive data and obtained @xmath2 .",
    "al com also underwent superoutbursts in 2001 may @xcite , 2007 october @xcite , and 2013 december @xcite .",
    "all of these superoutbursts showed early superhumps and rebrightenings .    on 2015 march",
    "4.582 ut , kevin hills reported an outburst of al com at a magnitude of @xmath9 ( vsnet - alert 18377 ) . immediately after this report",
    ", the vsnet collaboration team @xcite started a worldwide photometric campaign .",
    "surprisingly , the present outburst turned out to be a superoutburst , despite the fact that the brightness was much fainter than those in past superoutbursts and that the previous superoutburst occurred only @xmath10450 d before . here",
    ", we report our observation of al com during this unusual superoutburst .",
    "time - resolved ccd photometry was carried out by the vsnet collaboration team at seven sites .",
    "table 1 ( online only supplementary data ) shows the log of photometric observations .",
    "we also used the data downloaded from the aavso archive .. ] all of the observation times were converted to barycentric julian date ( bjd ) .",
    "the magnitude scales of each site were adjusted to that of the kolonica saddle system ( dpv in table 1 ) , where ucac4 522 - 052504 ( ra : 12h32m10.04s , dec:+ , @xmath5 = 13.51 , @xcite ) was used as the comparison star .",
    "the constancy of the comparison star was checked by nearby stars in the same images .    figure [ g - luminosity](a )",
    "represents the overall light curve of the 2015 outburst of al com . as can be seen in figure [ g - luminosity](a ) ,",
    "the duration of the plateau stage is @xmath010 d. this duration is significantly shorter than those of previous superoutbursts , for which the plateau stages lasted for 20 d or more @xcite . in addition , the maximum magnitude was 14.1 mag , about 2 mag fainter than those of previous superoutbursts . it also should be noted that the superoutburst was accompanied by a precursor ( bjd 2457086 ; see figure [ g - luminosity](b ) ) .",
    "the 2015 superoutburst of al com is the first case that a precursor was observed in wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "after the termination of the plateau stage , al com underwent a rebrightening .",
    "the present rebrightening was well classified as the type - a rebrightening ( see also @xcite ) .",

    ", the growth time scale of the superhumps can be determined as @xmath103 d , an unprecedentedly short value among wz sge - type dwarf novae . despite careful analyses before the appearance of the superhumps ,",
    "no evidence for early superhumps was present .",
    "the present superoutburst of al com is also the first example in which early superhumps are absent in a superoutburst of wz sge - type dwarf novae . in figure [ s - luminosity](b )",
    ", an enlarged light curve on bjd 2457105 is depicted .",
    "we can see the regrowth of superhumps after the temporary disappearance of superhumps around the dip in the rebrightening phase in figure [ s - luminosity](b ) .",
    "next , we performed a period analysis by using the phase dispersion minimization method ( pdm : @xcite ) during the plateau stage . in order to subtract a global trend from the light curve , we used locally weighted polynomical regression ( lowess : @xcite ) .",
    "the 1@xmath11 errors for the pdm analysis were calculated by the methods in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resultant @xmath12 diagram is shown in the upper panel of figure [ s - pdm ] .",
    "the obtained period of @xmath1 = 0.0573185(11 ) d well agrees with those of previous superoutbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 60 mm , 70mm)double.eps    ( 70 mm , 80mm)pdm.ps    we show the @xmath3 curve of superhump - maximum timings of al com in the upper panel of figure [ o - c ] .",
    "the light curve during bjd @xmath13 is shown in the lower panel of figure [ o - c ] . in the upper panel of figure [ o - c ]",
    ", the @xmath3 curve does not seem to be linear .",
    "therefore , we regard superhumps in the plateau stage as stage b superhumps @xcite",
    ". we could not find stage a and stage c superhumps in the upper panel of figure [ o - c ] .",
    "the time derivative of the superhump period @xmath14 was recorded in stage b. this value agrees with those obtained in previous superoutbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 80 mm , 100mm)oc.ps",
    "one of the most surprising results is that al com exhibited a superoutburst with a recurrence time of @xmath0450 d , despite the fact that the al com is classified as wz sge - type dwarf novae and that a supercycle of the system has been @xmath06 yr over the past 20 years .",
    "wz sge stars having a short supercycle include al com and ez lyn .",
    "ez lyn has the shortest recorded interval between superoutbursts of @xmath04 yr , based on the reported superoutbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the present superoutburst of al com has established the shortest interval of superoutbursts among wz sge - type dwarf novae . at present , the reason why al com underwent a superoutburst with such a short interval is unclear ; it was likely disk instability was somehow triggered earlier than in past superoutbursts .",
    "it should be noted that a precursor was observed for the first time in wz sge - type dwarf novae ( see figure [ g - luminosity](b ) ) .",
    "the absence of a precursor in wz sge - type dwarf novae is confirmed in e.g. , gw lib @xcite , v455 and @xcite , and wz sge itself @xcite .",
    "these systems show large - amplitude and long - lasting superoutbursts compared with the present superoutburst of al com . according to the thermal - tidal instability model ,",
    "the disk radius of the main superoutburst in which precursors are observed critically exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius during the precursor outburst ( see , figure 4 of @xcite ) . in combination with the thermal - tidal instability model and the past investigation of the disk radius variation",
    "as reviewed in section 1 , the observed precursor in the present superoutburst suggests that the maximum radius of the accretion disk is slightly larger than the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the present superoutburst lacked early superhumps .",
    "in other words , superhumps appeared @xmath103 d from the onset of the superoutburst .",
    "the appearance of the superhumps in the present superoutburst was about a week earlier than those in previous superoutbursts .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported that it took 10 d for superhumps to develop during the 1995 superoutburst . according to @xcite ,",
    "the growth time of the tidal instability is inversely proportional to the square of the mass ratio .",
    "@xcite also followed this interpretation . instead , @xcite and @xcite proposed that early superhumps are manifestation of the 2:1 resonance radius and that the 2:1 resonance suppresses the development of superhumps .",
    "the observed precursor and the lack of early superhumps can be explained as the result of condition that the maximum radius is below the 2:1 resonance .",
    "the striking difference of the development of ordinary superhumps on the same object ( al com ) indicates that the mass ratio can not be the main cause of the long delay of appearance of ordinary superhumps in wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "we can interpret that the 2:1 resonance ( and its manifestation , early superhumps ) suppresses the development of ordinary superhumps .      from the @xmath3 diagram",
    ", we derived @xmath15 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with those of previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the extensive data of @xmath16 , @xcite suggested that each object has the same @xmath16 regardless of whether or not the superoutburst is accompanied by a precursor in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the present superoutburst further supports the result of @xcite even in wz sge - type ones .",
    "although the plateau stage of the present superoutburst was similar to those of su uma - type dwarf novae , a long rebrightening ( type - a rebrightening ) was observed in the present outburst of al com .",
    "al com showed the type - a ( or type a / b ) rebrightening also in all of the previous superoutbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the 2015 outburst ,",
    "the rebrightening type was the same as previous ones in spite that the stored disk mass just before the outburst should have been much less than previous ones , which means that the rebrightening type of al com is the same regardless of the extent of outburst .",
    "it may be possible that the matter remained outside the 3:1 resonance if the radius of the 3:1 resonance is well inside the roche lobe .",
    "the uniqueness of the type of the rebrightening within the same object is recorded not only in al com but also in other wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "for example , ez lyn showed only type - b rebrightening .",
    "another example is the 2003 - 04 and 2013 superoutbursts of uz boo , which showed only type - b rebrightening @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 in terms of the type of the rebrightening , in which each type of the rebrightening pattern is clustered on the @xmath18 diagram ( see figure 83 of @xcite ) . in conjunction with the present study and the @xmath18 diagram",
    ", the type of the rebrightening seems to be inherent in the same system .",
    "this reproducibility of rebrightening type needs to be explained by theoretical investigations .    as shown in figure [ s - luminosity](b ) ,",
    "a regrowth of the superhumps was observed during the rebrightenings .",
    "this suggests that the accretion disk again extended beyond the 3:1 resonance radius over the course of the rebrightenings .",
    "we have reported unusual superoutburst and rebrightening of al com in 2015 march .",
    "we summarize the most important results of our observations as follows :    1 .",
    "al com showed a superoutburst with an interval of @xmath0450 d. this interval is the shortest record among wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "the light curve showed a precursor and lacked early superhumps , which is the first example in the superoutbursts of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "the presence of the precursor and the lack of early superhumps suggest that the maximum disk radius of this superoutburst barely exceeded the 3:1 resonance and did not reach the 2:1 resonance radius following the theory proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "al com showed the type - a rebrightening in the present superoutburst , despite the fact that the main superoutburst mimicked the typical one in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , and despite that the mass stored in the accretion disk at the onset of the superoutburst is supposed to be much smaller than those in previous superoutbursts of al com .",
