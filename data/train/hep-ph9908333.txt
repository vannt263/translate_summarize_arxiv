    "it was realized early on  @xcite that the gravitino could pose a serious cosmological problem in the context of a hot big - bang , if it were once in thermal equilibrium .",
    "an unstable gravitino , for instance , would decay in the post - big - bang nucleosynthesis era , if its mass @xmath1gev , and the entropy produced would ruin the successes of big - bang nucleosynthesis . similarly , if the gravitino were stable , as _",
    "e.g. _ , in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , its energy density would eventually overclose the universe , if its mass @xmath2kev .",
    "a solution to this problem was brought forward in ref .",
    "@xcite : if inflation took place , the gravitinos present at the time of big - bang nucleosynthesis were created during reheating , in an abundance possibly much smaller than that corresponding to thermal equilibrium .",
    "cosmological constraints on their abundance could then be turned into useful upper limits on the reheating temperature @xmath3  @xcite , typically @xmath4gev , for an unstable gravitino with @xmath5gev , or @xmath6gev , for a stable gravitino with @xmath7 .",
    "these studies assume that the gravitino abundance has been exponentially suppressed during inflation , and that gravitinos were only created in particle interactions during reheating .",
    "however , particles can be produced out of the vacuum in a non - static gravitational background if their coupling to the gravitational field is not conformal  @xcite .",
    "a well - known case is the production of gravitational waves or scalar density perturbations during inflation . as we argue below",
    ", a massive gravitino is not conformally invariant in a friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) background , and our main objective is thus to quantify the number density of gravitinos that can be produced gravitationally during inflation .",
    "we will consider a generic inflation scenario within @xmath8 supergravity  @xcite , and briefly discuss the more particular case of pre - big bang cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological consequences of gravitino production during inflation were briefly discussed in ref .",
    "these authors did not actually study the gravitational production of gravitinos , and rather focused on the spin 0 and spin 1/2 cases , as they were interested in the problem of moduli and modulini fields . with regards to the gravitino , they assumed that one particle would be produced per quantum state for modes with comoving wavenumber @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the hubble scale of inflation .",
    "this estimate showed that gravitational production of gravitinos could pose a cosmological problem if the energy scale @xmath11 at which inflation takes place saturates its observational upper bound , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12gev , and in this respect , it justifies further the present work .",
    "our study is more specialized than that of ref .",
    "@xcite , as we concentrate exclusively on the gravitino . however , it is also more systematic and more detailed , as we derive and solve the gravitino field equation to provide quantitative estimates of the number density of gravitinos produced .",
    "we also examine different cases for the magnitude and dynamics of the gravitino effective mass term during and after inflation .",
    "finally , we also study the effect of a finite duration of the transition between inflation and reheating , using numerical integration of the field equation .",
    "this effect is important , as this timescale defines the `` degree of adiabaticity '' of the transition , and indeed the number density of gravitinos produced is found to be inversely proportional to it .",
    "the study of the conformal behavior of the gravitino also bears interest of its own , apart from any application to cosmology , and to our knowledge , the quantization of quantum fields in curved space - time has been examined for spins 0 , 1/2 , 1 and 2 , but not @xmath13",
    "@xcite ( although the case of a massless gravitino in a perfect fluid cosmology was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the helicity 3/2 modes of the gravitino . the field equations and the quantization of the helicity 1/2 modes are indeed more delicate , due to the presence of constraints .",
    "these constraints vanish identically if supersymmetry is unbroken  @xcite ; in broken supersymmetry , these constraints do not vanish , but do not induce any inconsistency  @xcite . as shown below , these constraints apply to the modes of helicity 1/2 , not to those of helicity 3/2 , and for this reason , we leave the problem of the helicity 1/2 modes open for a further study ; nonetheless , we present these field equations and their constraints . the number density of helicity 3/2 gravitinos produced during inflation that we derive in this paper should thus be interpreted as a lower limit . quite probably , however , the number density of helicity 1/2 gravitinos should be of the same order as that of helicity 3/2 , and the results correct within a factor of order 2 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we derive the gravitino field equation for the @xmath0 helicity modes , and in section  iii , we calculate the number density of gravitinos produced in a generic inflation scenario .",
    "we summarize our conclusions and briefly discuss the case of pre - big - bang string cosmology in section  iv .",
    "all throughout this paper , we use natural units @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "we note @xmath16 the planck mass .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to a frw background , whose metric is written as : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the scale factor , and @xmath19 denotes conformal time ; the minkowski metric is written @xmath20 .",

    "notably , @xmath192 scales as the inverse of the transition timescale , which defines the degree of `` non - adiabaticity '' of the transition during which gravitinos are produced .",
    "the comparison of the gravitational production of gravitinos to production in reheating depends on the details of the mechanism of reheating , during which the gravitationally produced gravitinos are strongly diluted .",
    "if we assume that the gravitino mass is of order of the hubble constant during or after inflation , that @xmath267gev , and that the universe is matter dominated throughout reheating , gravitational production is generically less efficient than production in reheating interactions , provided the transition is not too abrupt , _ i.e. _ @xmath251 .",
    "however , in scenarios of new inflation , one can find @xmath268 , in which case gravitational production would turn out to produce as many gravitinos , or more , than reheating interactions .",
    "similarly , if reheating proceeds faster , for instance if the universe is dominated by a relativistic fluid during reheating , as happens in _ e.g. _ , chaotic inflation with a potential @xmath136 , the number density of gravitinos produced out of the vacuum exceeds , possibly by a large factor , the density of gravitinos produced in particle interactions during reheating . it must be stressed that in the above , we assumed the effective mass @xmath39 of the gravitino to be of order the hubble constant , either during or after inflation .",
    "if not , gravitational production is suppressed as @xmath265 .    to conclude ,",
    "let us briefly address the particular case of pre - big - bang string cosmology  @xcite , in which particle production out of the vacuum has been studied extensively  @xcite , but not for spin@xmath111 . in this scenario",
    ", one expects that , to leading order , the gravitino mass term vanishes during inflation , if the only dynamical field is the axion - dilaton field , as indeed , the tree level superpotential of string - inspired supergravity does not receive contributions from the dilaton .",
    "similarly , @xmath102 also in the post - inflationary phase ( if only the axion - dilaton field is considered ) , at least until a non perturbative superpotential for the dilaton sets in , or until supersymmetry breaking takes place .",
    "if we assume that the gravitino is also massless during the so - called stringy phase , it then couples to the axion - dilaton field only through the khler connection .",
    "the field equation eq .",
    "( [ eq_mode3_2 ] ) then decouples into two first order differential equations for the mode functions @xmath269 and @xmath270 , whose solutions are written as in flat - space up to a time - dependent phase which depends on the khler connection . if the initial state corresponds to the conformal vacuum as @xmath170 , then @xmath271 .",
    "since we assume that the gravitino remains massless after inflation , conformal triviality also holds as @xmath171 , and @xmath272 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq_bbeta ] ) , it is then obvious that @xmath273 , _",
    "i.e. _ no particle production takes place .    at the next level of approximation",
    ", one should consider moduli fields , take into account higher order corrections to the effective action in the stringy phase , and/or introduce a non - perturbative superpotential to stabilize the dilaton in the frw phase .",
    "this would lead , quite presumably , to the appearance of an effective mass for the gravitino .",
    "unfortunately , these effects are difficult to implement , because the underlying dynamics or the physics remain poorly known . to give an example of what could be obtained ,",
    "let us assume that the gravitino is massless during the pre - big bang and stringy phases , and that it acquires a mass after the exit in the frw era .",
    "then the methods and results of the previous section can easily be transposed to this scenario , since the gravitino , being massless in the pre - frw eras , is insensitive to the background dynamics .",
    "it is easy to verify that if the exit in the frw phase takes place at a scale @xmath274gev , as has been advocated recently  @xcite , gravitational and reheating production of gravitinos become of the same order , even if the universe is matter dominated throughout reheating , provided @xmath275 .",
    "however , reheating in pre - big bang cosmology is not expected to proceed through coherent oscillations of the `` inflaton '' , and the above estimate could turn out to be naive .",
    "a detailed study of the mechanism of reheating in pre - big bang cosmology thus appears mandatory . depending on how fast reheating proceeds , and what temperature is achieved",
    ", this could lead to a strong gravitino problem ( which one would naively expect if @xmath276gev ) , which would thus require : @xmath277gev for an unstable gravitino , or @xmath278kev for a stable gravitino . a more detailed study of this problem",
    "is left for further work .",
    "* note added *    upon completion of this paper , we became aware of a related work by a.  l.  maroto and a.  mazumdar ( `` production of spin 3/2 particles from vacuum fluctuations '' , hep - ph/9904206 ) .",
    "these authors obtained the field equation for helicity 3/2 gravitinos , assuming @xmath279 ( which projects out helicity 1/2 modes ) , and calculated the amplification of vacuum fluctuations , using the technique of bogoliubov transforms .",
    "they applied their technique to the production of gravitinos in preheating . in this respect ,",
    "their work and ours are complementary : gravitational production during inflation generically produces particles with wavenumber @xmath280 , while in preheating , the production takes place for modes with @xmath281 .",
    "after the present paper was submitted , two other related studies appeared : r.  kallosh , l.  kofman , a.  linde and a.  van  proeyen ( `` gravitino production after inflation '' , hep - ph/9907124 ) studied the problem of gravitino production during inflation and during preheating , for both helicity 1/2 and helicity 3/2 modes .",
    "their important work shows that the helicity 1/2 modes are not conformally invariant even if they are massless , and that their production in preheating can be very large .",
    "the paper by g.  f.  giudice , a.  riotto and i.  tkachev ( `` non - thermal production of dangerous relics in the early universe '' , hep - ph/9907510 ) reaches similar conclusions .",
    "we write @xmath282 a general relativistic dirac matrix , and @xmath283 , or , if confusion could arise , @xmath284 , a ( constant ) flat - space dirac matrix .",
    "we define : @xmath285 $ ] .",
    "the dirac matrices are written in the weyl representation :            where we defined @xmath294 .",
    "we define the helicity operator @xmath295 for a weyl spinor of momentum @xmath69 , where @xmath64 is the unitary vector along @xmath69 .",
    "we then define @xmath296 and @xmath297 as the eigenspinors of @xmath298 with respective helicity @xmath299 and @xmath300 : @xmath301 .",
    "we decompose a four component spinor @xmath302 in eigenstates of helicity  @xcite , @xmath303 , with :      where @xmath305 , and @xmath306 are ( scalar ) functions of conformal time .",
    "the eigenspinors @xmath307 and @xmath308 verify , in particular : @xmath309 . in section  ii , we perform a similar decomposition for the spinor - vector in terms of the mode functions @xmath310 , where @xmath311 denotes the helicity of the polarization vector , and @xmath312 denotes the spinor helicity .    finally , we define the charge conjugation operator : @xmath313 , and the conjugate @xmath314 of a spinor @xmath315 : @xmath316 . one can show that : @xmath317 , where @xmath312 .",
