    "the very young system ( henceforth ) , located in the orion star - forming region , has been identified by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter smv06 ) as the first known substellar eclipsing binary ( eb ) .",
    "ebs allow exquisitely precise direct determinations of the component masses and radii , as well the ratio of their surface brightnesses ( or equivalently , ratio of their ) .",
    "as such ,  allows the first stringent tests of the theoretical evolutionary models widely employed to characterize the vast majority of brown dwarfs ( for which direct measurements of mass and radius are not possible ) .",
    "the analysis of smv06 ( and the follow - up analysis of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveals that : _ ( 1 ) _ both components of are moderate - mass brown dwarfs ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 m@xmath13 ) ; _ ( 2 ) _ their radii are @xmath710% larger than expected from standard evolutionary models for their assumed age of 1 myr ( see fig .  3 of * ?",
    "* ) ; and _ ( 3 ) _ the ratio of the secondary s to primary s  is @xmath14 , i.e. , the more massive primary is _ cooler _ than its less massive companion .",
    "this last point is highly surprising , since all standard models for substellar evolution predict that for coeval bodies ( as the eb components are likely to be ; but see  5.2 ) , higher mass translates to higher , not lower .",
    "the most compelling explanation for the  reversal ( and radius discrepancy ) has been advanced by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth cgb07 ) , who propose that it arises from the suppression of convection by rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , they show that a significant reduction in convective efficiency combined with a large areal coverage of cool magnetic spots , in the primary , can reproduce smv06 s results ; as a by - product , they predict s of 2320k and 2440k for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "this hypothesis has been bolstered via optical spectroscopy by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth r07 ) , who find that the primary is indeed rapidly rotating and evinces strong @xmath9 emission indicative of large surface magnetic fields ( @xmath7 10 ; @xmath9 equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath15 32.6  @xmath16 @xmath17/@xmath18 @xmath16 magnetic field strength @xmath19 @xmath7 4 kg ) , while the secondary is a slow rotator with comparatively weak @xmath9 emission / magnetic fields ( @xmath20 5 ; @xmath9 ew @xmath7 4.8  @xmath16 @xmath17/@xmath21 @xmath16 @xmath19 @xmath7 2 kg ) .    nevertheless , two open questions remain .",
    "first , r07 s support of cgb07 s theory depends on ascribing the strong @xmath9 emission in the primary to chromospheric activity ( which allows r07 to translate it to a magnetic field strength using the field dwarf @xmath17/@xmath22 relationship found by * ? ? ?",
    "however ,  is an extremely young system in a star - forming region ; like stars , brown dwarfs at such ages very often exhibit strong @xmath9 emission due to _ disk accretion _ instead of activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the contamination of the primary s instrinsic emission by the strong nebular emission ( which permits r07 to set only a lower limit on its @xmath9 ew ) means that the line profile and ew can not categorically exclude accretion ; another diagnostic is required .",
    "second , the absolute s of the components of  have yet to be accurately determined .",
    "smv06 s eclipse data do not allow a direct measure of the individual  of the components , only their ratio , so spectral type information was used to estimate the separate temperatures . from optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectra and colors ,",
    "stassun et al . ( 2007 , henceforth s07 ) find spectral types of @xmath7 m6.5m7 for the components , and thereby  @xmath7 2700k and @xmath7 2900k for the primary and secondary respectively .",
    "r07 further find these temperatures to be consistent with detailed analysis of tio bands in high - resolution optical spectra .",
    "cgb07 , on the other hand , predict s significantly cooler , by @xmath7300k , for both ( see above ) .",
    "temperatures derived independently of spectral types can thus validate / constrain both the cgb07 models and the spectral type  conversion scale in the presence of suppressed convection .    detailed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) observations and modeling are ideal for investigating both questions .",
    "for example , a lack of significant mid - infrared ( mir ) excess dust emission would strongly argue against any surrounding optically thick accretion disks in , and thus against ongoing accretion , making the case for chromospheric activity in the primary more robust .",
    "simultaneously , detection of photospheric levels from the optical to the mir ( in the absence of disk emission ) would allow constraints on the s via more general blackbody / opacity considerations than spectral type arguments .",
    "to accomplish these goals , in this paper we combine nir photometry from the literature with new _ spitzer _",
    "photometry over 3.624 @xmath0 m and gemini photometry at 0.48 @xmath0 m , to construct a complete sed of  from 0.48 @xmath0 m to 24 @xmath0 m (  2 ) . in ",
    "3 we present synthetic sed models of substellar objects surrounded by disks with various geometries , for the purpose of comparing against the observed sed of .",
    "results are presented in  4 , where we find that the observations clearly indicate that is devoid of optically thick disk dust within at least @xmath7 0.610au of the brown dwarfs , sugesting that accretion is negligible or absent in .",
    "we also find that the observed sed is most consistent with a relatively warm temperature scale for the brown dwarfs , similar to that found for field m dwarfs . as we discuss in  5 , the observational evidence",
    "now strongly implicates magnetic activity on the primary ( more massive ) brown dwarf as the reason for the surprising reversal of temperatures in .",
    "however , the cgb07 models of young brown dwarfs undergoing magnetically suppressed convection predict s several hundred k cooler than inferred from the observed sed , and in  5 we discuss possible ways to rectify this discrepancy .",
    "we constructed the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of from broadband flux measurements over the wavelength range 0.4824 @xmath0 m .",
    "these measurements are summarized in table 1 . in all cases we confirmed that the observations were made outside eclipse , to ensure that the full combined flux of both components was obtained .",
    "in addition , as noted below , we adopt uncertainties somewhat larger than the formal measurement errors to account for systematic errors and/or spot - induced variability in .",
    "nir magnitudes at @xmath23 ( 1.22.2 @xmath0 m ) were taken from the 2mass database and converted to fluxes using the zero - points described in the 2mass all - sky data release explanatory supplement .",
    "the formal uncertainties in each passband are @xmath24 mag .",

    "an optical flux at @xmath25 was taken from the observations of @xcite , where we adopt an uncertainty of 0.1 mag to account for out - of - eclipse variability observed in the @xmath26 band ( s07 ) .",

    "we observed at all four passbands of the irac instrument ( 3.68 @xmath0 m ) , with the irs instrument in blue peak - up mode ( 16 @xmath0 m ) , and with the mips instrument at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "forty irac frames were obtained in high dynamic range mode in a medium - scale dither pattern .",
    "one 12-s long exposure and one 0.6-s short exposure were obtained for each frame in all 4 channels , yielding total exposure times of 480  s and 24  s for the long and short exposures respectively .",
    "this allowed us to avoid overexposing in the more sensitive channels 1 and 2 ( 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m ) while obtaining sufficient s / n in the less sensitive channels 3 and 4 ( 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m ) .",

    "we followed the procedure described in the irac data handbook for performing aperture photometry on the pipeline generated mosaic images . specifically , we used an aperture radius of 3 pixels and a background annulus of 37 pixels , and then applied aperture correction factors of 1.124 , 1.127 , 1.143 , and 1.234 in irac channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "photometry for channels 1 and 2 was performed on the short exposure images , and for channels 3 and 4 on the long exposures .",

    ", the figure also shows a model sed using the dusty model atmospheres of @xcite at the radii and temperatures determined by s07 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32  k , @xmath33  k ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosities are computed directly from the temperatures and radii ( via the stefan - boltzmann relation ) . the model sed was fit to the data via @xmath34 minimization , where the only free parameters are the distance and the extinction , for which we find @xmath35 pc and @xmath36 mag .",

    "to compare the observed sed of  with that expected from young brown dwarfs with disks , we employed the monte carlo radiative transfer code of @xcite to generate model seds .",
    "the code randomly emits photons from the central illuminating source(s ) and follows the photons as they interact with ( i.e. , are absorbed or scattered by ) any circumstellar material .",
    "here we model the circumstellar material as an optically thick circumbinary disk of dust extending from an inner truncation radius , @xmath39 , to an outer radius of 100 au .",
    "the code self - consistently solves for thermal equilibrium in the disk as absorbed photons heat the disk and are re - radiated .",
    "sublimation of dust is also included ( for details of the dust properties used by the code , see table 3 of * ? ? ?",

    "built into the code are the solar - metallicity nextgen atmosphere models of @xcite , which are virtually identical to the dusty models at the warm  of s07 .",
    "we considered two classes of disk models , corresponding to different flaring assumptions :    1 .   flared disk , where disk scale - height @xmath40 increases with radial distance @xmath41 from the star : @xmath42 ( @xmath43 = scale - height at stellar surface determined via hydrostatic equilibrium calculation , typically @xmath44 )",
    "this corresponds to a disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and well - mixed gas and dust , with flaring caused by heating of grains in the optically thin disk surface by stellar irradiation .",
    "2 .   geometrically thin , flat disk , where @xmath40 remains constant with @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to the case where all the grains have settled to the disk mid - plane .    in all models",
    "( except one case in  4.1 where explicitly stated otherwise ) we used a disk mass of @xmath45 with a surface density profile falling off like @xmath46 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the disks are modeled as  passive \" disks , i.e.  they do not generate any intrinsic lumonisity via accretion . as such",
    ", the fluxes predicted by these model seds should be regarded as the _ minimum _ fluxes that such disks would be expected to produce .",
    "the resulting model seds for the two disk classes above are shown in figs .",
    "[ knife - sed - fig ] and [ flared - sed - fig ] .",
    "figs .  [ knife - sed - fig][flared - sed - fig ] show that , if the disk is optically thick and viewed edge - on ( i.e. , in the orbital plane of the eclipsing binary , as expected from the standard assumption of co - planarity ) , then only a geometrically thin flat disk can fit the observed flux measurements at 0.488.0@xmath0 m and upper limits at 1624@xmath0m.m upper limit ; while remaining consistent with the 24@xmath0 m upper limit , they imply that the true 24@xmath0 m flux must be much lower .",
    "any flat disk model that passes through the 24@xmath0 m upper limit produces a 16@xmath0 m flux much higher than the observed upper limit in the latter band , and can thus be ruled out .",
    "] moreover , such a flat disk , if present , must also possess a large inner hole at least 0.6 au in radius .",
    "dropping the coplanarity assumption yields even larger inner holes ( not shown ) : as the disk is seen more face - on , the observed flux from it increases , requiring a larger hole to bring the flux back down to the observed values / upper limits .",
    "an optically thick `` flared ''",
    "disk can only fit the data if it is severely non - coplanar with the binary orbital plane _ and _ has a very large inner hole ( fig.[flared - sed - fig ] ) . if seen edge - on , the relatively large vertical scale - heights of the outer regions of such a disk produce @xmath47 mag of extinction at 1 @xmath0 m , and even more at shorter wavelengths .",
    "( the model seds show strong sampling noise in fig .",
    "[ flared - sed - fig ] due to the severe attenuation of photons from the brown dwarfs at these wavelengths . ) thus to match the observed optical and nir sed , it needs to be seen at a much more face - on orientation . as in the flat disk case ,",
    "however , the observed mir flux increases with such orientation ( and more severely so for the flared disk than the flat , since the former intercepts more stellar radiation than the latter for a given hole size ) .",
    "this again pushes the hole inner radius to even larger values to remain consistent with the mir data . the result , as shown in fig .",
    "[ flared - sed - fig ] , is that an optically thick flared disk can only fit the observed sed of  if it is inclined to the orbital plane by @xmath48 and simultaneously possesses an inner hole at least @xmath49 au in radius .",
    "all the above immediately also implies that no optically thick disk exists around the individual components , since the smallest hole size the data can accomodate for such a disk is 0.6 au , while the binary semi - major axis is only 0.04 au ( s07 ) .",
    "thus an optically thick disk , if at all present , must be circumbinary .",
    "the results also imply that any disk material that extends inwards of 0.6 au must be optically thin .",
    "we explore this case further by assuming an inner truncation radius equal to the tidal truncation radius for the binary .",
    "based on the simulations by @xcite , we take this to be @xmath73 times the semi - major axis ( 0.04 au ) @xmath50 0.1 au . for a flat disk with a hole of this size , and the same disk outer radius and radial density profile as before , we find the maximum dust - disk mass consistent with the data to be 10@xmath6 ( i.e. , a paltry 10@xmath51 of the total binary mass ) .",
    "note that a smaller inner hole would imply an even smaller disk mass ; as a corollary , any optically thin disks around the individual components must also be less massive than this limit .",
    "accretion can be ruled out for the optically thin disk cases : the extremely low dust masses implied for these , @xmath20 3@xmath5210@xmath53 lunar masses , are far too small for primordial accretion disks .",
    "for the optically thick cases , the lower limits on inner hole size of 0.6 - 10 au also makes accretion unlikely .",
    "even the smaller value of 0.6 au equals @xmath156 times the tidal truncation radius and @xmath730 times the dust destruction radius .",
    "such a large hole in the dust disk may be cleared either by substantial grain growth , or by sweeping of material by planet / planetesimal formation , or by photoevaporation .",
    "the first would imply very significant grain evolution , suggesting that the disk has probably moved beyond the main accretion phase .",
    "the other two scenarios would result in the clearing of gas as well as dust within the hole .",
    "all three scenarios therefore make significant ongoing accretion unlikely . moreover ,",
    "if accretion streams were indeed spiralling in from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk onto the binary , the theory and simulations of @xcite indicate that they should preferentially land on the less massive component , manifestly _ not _ the situation in  if the observed @xmath54 stronger @xmath9 emission in the primary @xcite is taken as an accretion indicator .",
    "additionally ,  exhibits no large - amplitude photometric variability ( s07 ) , in contrast to that seen in the young binaries so far shown to be experiencing accretion from circumbinary disks @xcite .",
    "finally , the data do not explicitly _ require _ the presence of a disk at all .",
    "the data out to 8 @xmath0 m in fact indicate a naked photosphere alone , and it is only the uncertainty embodied in the 16 and 24@xmath0 m upper limits ( and the lack of data beyond ) that forces a conservative inclusion of the possibility of a disk .",
    "all of the evidence taken together therefore suggests that significant ongoing gas accretion in this system is very unlikely , and that the strong @xmath9 emission observed in the primary is indeed related to chromospheric activity as suggested by r07 .",
    "we now discuss the  of the 2m0535 - 05 components in more detail , by comparing the observed sed to dusty synthetic spectra .",
    "we note that for the hotter  proposed by s07 , nextgen spectra ( which _ a priori _ neglect dust formation ) are very similar to dusty ones , since no dust forms at these relatively warm  anyway .",
    "however , the cooler ones proposed by cgb07 would lead to dust formation . for consistency , therefore , we use dusty models for evaluating both the the s07 and cgb07 temperatures .",

    "the match is clearly very good , with the predictions agreeing with the data to within @xmath56 in all bands .",

    "basically , the observed sed appears significantly bluer than expected at the cgb07 temperatures .",
    "_ prima facie _ , these results support the hotter  suggested by s07/r07 .",
    "one may argue that the synthetic spectra suffer from opacity uncertainties that considerably weaken the above comparisons and conclusion .",
    "given the huge number and complexity of atomic and molecular opacities that must be accurately modeled to reproduce such cool spectra , this objection is worthy of consideration .",
    "a counter - argument might be that we find the optical data to be bluer than predicted in fig .",
    "[ cool - sed - fig ] , while shortcomings in the opacities have led , if anything , to the observed optical colors ( e.g. , @xmath62 ) of field m dwarfs being _ redder _ than in the models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as those authors also show , newer opacities  incorporated in the models we use  have now substantially mitigated this discrepancy .",
    "nevertheless , it is fruitful to attack the problem via more general considerations .",
    "we do so by comparing our data to blackbody curves at the suggested temperatures .",
    "m - type spectra clearly depart significantly from pure blackbodies , but the precise _ manner _ in which they do so provides important insights . in particular , molecular opacities ( predominantly tio and vo ) strongly suppress the optical spectrum , relative to a blackbody at the same , in early- to mid - m dwarfs ; dust opacity exacerbates this effect in the late m types .",
    "a smaller suppression of flux also occurs over a large swathe of the mir due to h@xmath10o absorption . for",
    "a given , this flux must escape somewhere , and it does so predominantly in the nir , leading to an enhancement of flux , relative to a blackbody , at these wavelengths .",
    "the upshot is that for m type objects , a blackbody at the same  represents an upper limit to the actual emitted flux in the optical and mir , and a lower limit in the nir .",
    "this is a general prediction of basic opacity considerations in these objects , independent of the precise details of synthetic spectra and attendant opacity uncertainties",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ obs - sed - fig ] and [ cool - sed - fig ] show how our data compare to blackbodies at the s07/r07 and cgb07 respectively . in both plots ,",
    "the blackbodies have been scaled to the same distance and have been reddened by the same amount as the synthetic spectra , i.e. , the relative differences between the two are preserved . at the hotter",
    "proposed  ( fig .",
    "[ obs - sed - fig ] ) , where the synthetic spectra agree with the observations in all bands , the blackbody follows the prediction above : in the optical and mir it is brighter than , and in the nir fainter than or at most equal to , the observed ( and synthetic ) photometry . at the cgb07  ( fig .",
    "[ cool - sed - fig ] ) , however , the situation is very different : while the blackbody is somewhat brighter than the data in the mir and fainter than or equal to it in the nir , as expected , in the optical @xmath27-band the blackbody _ matches _ the data ( which is more than 4@xmath63 brighter than the synthetic @xmath27 , as stated earlier ) . in other words , if this were the correct , the synthetic spectra would have to produce flux _ at blackbody levels _ in the optical @xmath27-band to reproduce the data .",
    "this is very much against expectations for m type objects , as outlined above .",
    "these results again indicate that the hotter  proposed by s07/r07 better represent the true situation than the significantly cooler ones proposed by cgb07 . at the very least",
    ", we can conservatively state that the cgb07 s are a lower limit , and reality is likely to be closer to the s07/r07 results .",
    "it is somewhat more difficult to place an _ upper _",
    "limit on the component s based on our broad - band sed measurements . at warmer s , the model seds show bluer colors and produce higher luminosities ( for fixed radii ) .",
    "consequently , to accommodate warmer temperatures , the system must be placed at a larger distance and must be seen through larger amounts of extinction .",
    "meanwhile , the model seds change relatively little at @xmath64 m .",
    "thus it is possible to fit the observed sed very well with virtually any warmer  so long as the system is highly reddened and is placed at a suitably high distance .",
    "however , if we assume that the system can be no further than 520 pc and reddened by at most @xmath65 , then the maximum temperatures that still allow the model sed to fit the data within 95% confidence are @xmath66 = \\left[3230{\\rm k},3435{\\rm k}\\right]$ ] , where again we adopt the  ratio and radii from s07 .",
    "we emphasize that this upper limit is based solely on the broad - band sed ; such high s would not be consistent with the spectral typing of smv06 or the high - resolution spectral modeling of r07 , which indicate maximum s of @xmath66 \\approx \\left[2850{\\rm k},3000{\\rm k}\\right]$ ] .",
    "our _ spitzer _ observations rule out optically thick circumstellar disks around the individual components of .",
    "while the data can not completely rule out a optically thick circumbinary disk , due to the upper limits in the 16 and 24@xmath0 m photometry , any such disk must have a large inner hole : @xmath67 au inner radius if the disk is flared , or @xmath68 au if it is flat .",
    "these dust hole sizes would imply clearing by either significant grain growth and evolution , which in turn makes it likely that the disk is near the end of , or beyond , its main accretion phase ; or by planetesimal formation or photoevaporation , both of which would clear gas as well as dust within the hole , also making significant ongoing accretion unlikely .",
    "we also stress that the derived inner - disk hole sizes are _ lower limits _ based on our 16 and 24@xmath0 m photometry upper limits ; thus it is very likely that the holes are significantly bigger ( or indeed that there is no disk at all ) .",
    "accretion is also unlikely given that ( a ) it is the primary that shows large h@xmath69 emission ( while binary accretion theory predicts preferential accretion onto the secondary ) , and ( b ) there is no evidence for the type of large - amplitude photometric variability usually observed in accreting systems @xcite . in combination , these results indicate that it is not accretion but chromopsheric activity that underlies the strong @xmath9 emission from the  primary . in turn , this bolsters the argument , made by cgb07 and r07 , that the  reversal between the components is due to the combined effects of the rotation and magnetic fields that underlie activity .",
    "we now discuss the s07/r07 and cgb07  results in this light .",
    "there are two important reasons for trying to distinguish between the hotter s for  determined by s07/r07 and the much cooler ones proffered by cgb07 .",
    "the first concerns activity .",
    "cgb07 are able to match smv06 s mass - radius data by invoking , in the primary , both a large global reduction in convective efficiency ( mixing length parameter @xmath70 instead of the usual @xmath71 ) and a large covering fraction of cool spots @xmath72 = 0.5 , leading to a primary  @xmath73k . at least in field dwarfs",
    ", however , such  are typical of @xmath15 m9 dwarfs , which are usually highly _",
    "in_active despite rapid rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the generally adopted reason for this is a rapid drop in the photospheric ionization levels at such low  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon appears to extend to m dwarfs in star - forming regions as well , where the same reduction in activity ( e.g. , in x - rays ) is seen with later m - types , and ascribed to the same physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    adopting the cgb07",
    "would thus imply that the  primary is somehow able to remain extremely active despite being very cool .",
    "cgb07 acknowledge this problem , but their solution  activity started on the primary when it was much hotter , but the resulting suppression of convection eventually drove its  down to its present value ",
    "does not appear very satisfactory : the primary still has to _ maintain _ very strong activity at its _ current _  to explain the ( observed ) large @xmath9 emission and ( proposed ) very high spot covering fraction .",
    "the s07/r07 , corresponding to usual mid - m values , would be much more consistent with such activity / spot coverage : activity levels peak in the mid - m types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the second issue with the lower s suggested by cgb07 concerns the fundamental parameters assigned to brown dwarfs and low mass stars in general , based on their  and luminosity .",
    "to illustrate this , we plot both  components on the hr diagram , at the positions corresponding to the s07 and cgb07  estimates ( fig .",
    "[ subu - fig ] ) . the theoretical evolutionary tracks and isochrones plotted",

    ", it is evident that the primary appears less massive than it really is ( 0.054 m@xmath13 ) and also much younger than expected ( @xmath7 1 myr ) , while the secondary appears more massive than its true value and slightly older than expected .",
    "the disparity in the secondary s position can be explained if the evolutionary tracks are slightly ( @xmath74 k ) too cold , or the spectral type to  conversion is a little too hot ( or , probably , a combination of both ) .",
    "note that such a correction would simultaneously _ enhance _ the disparity in the primary s position ( since the  ratio of the secondary to primary is empirically fixed ) : this is of course precisely the empirically observed reversal in  we are seeking to explain . at any rate ,",
    "the point is that the secondary s position in the hr diagram is not very far removed from its real one if one uses the  suggested by its spectral type .",

    "_ much higher ( by @xmath7300k ) than the secondary  derived by cgb07 by including its minor rotation / b - field .",

    "we briefly examine the viability of two other potential mechanisms for producing the temperature reversal .",
    "_ accretion _ : disk accretion can change the properties ( radius , luminosity ) of t tauri stars ; while the components of  appear to be post - accretion , is it possible that the effects of their past accretion phase ( which must have occurred ) linger , and give rise to the observed temperature reversal ?",
    "the brief answer is that this is quite improbable , for the following reason . in most t tauri stars , with accretion rates",
    "@xmath77 , the accretion is assumed to be `` cold '' .",
    "that is , the thermal energy of the accreted material is radiated away into space from the uppermost photospheric layers over a small fraction of the stellar surface , and contributes negligibly to the internal energy of the star @xcite .",
    "it is only in the extreme conditions and very high accretion rates found in fu orionis - type objects that this condition is likely to be violated . in the `` cold '' limit , the effect of accretion ( when the accretion timescale becomes comparable to , or shorter than , the kelvin - helmholtz timescale ) is to decrease the stellar luminosity by decreasing the _ radius _ , without affecting the stellar temperature very much : essentially , the star does not have time to expand to the radius it would have for the corresponding mass in the absence of accretion .    in the case of the bd components under discussion here ,",
    "the past accretion for each should have been of order @xmath78 yr@xmath79 ( given their masses of @xmath7 0.05 , and assuming a minimum age of 10@xmath80 years ) .",
    "inserting this along with their other properties into the equations supplied by @xcite shows that the `` cold '' limit is applicable to our bds as well , as might have been intuitively expected from the much smaller accretion rates in bds compared to t tauri stars .",
    "one does not therefore expect the accretion to change their temperatures by any significant amount , only their radii .",
    "recent calculations assuming `` cold '' accretion in bds bear this out : accretion rates of @xmath81 yr@xmath79 can decrease the bd radius significantly ( up to few tens of percent ) , thus making it sub - luminous compared to a non - accretor of the same mass , but the temperature of the bd remains virtually unchanged from its value in the absence of accretion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also discussion of the latter results in chabrier et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore",
    ", while future calculations should further clarify the effects of accretion on bd properties , it appears quite unlikely that the temperature reversal observed in  is caused by the lingering effects of past accretion .",
    "_ non - coevality _ : second is the intriguing possibility that the assumption of coevality for the binary components may not be quite true . from comparisons to theoretical tracks , s07 concluded that an age difference of @xmath7 0.5 myr , together with a slight ( @xmath7 70k ) reduction in the  derived from spectral types , could in fact explain the entirety of the  reversal without resorting to any other mechanism .    on the one hand , the reality of non - coevality effects in determining initial binary properties is strongly suggested by another eclipsing binary , also in the onc , discovered recently by @xcite .",
    "the stellar components of this system have almost exactly the same mass ( 0.41 m@xmath13 ) but differ greatly in  ( by @xmath7300k ) and luminosity ( by a factor of @xmath82 ) . with both stars exhibiting very small h@xmath69 emission , indicating very low field strengths , as well as",
    "nearly the same , field and rotation effects do not appear plausible for explaining their differences .",
    "however , a difference of a few hundred thousand years in the individual ages of the stars can indeed do the trick , as stassun et al .",
    "a similar non - coevality in  therefore can not be discounted .    at the same time , the reality of field / rotation effects on low mass objects is also strongly supported by recent data . in particular , @xcite show that very active field dwarfs are cooler and larger than their non - active counterparts at the same luminosity ( or equivalently same mass , given the tight mass - luminosity correlation on the low - mass zams ) .",
    "given that the components of  have the same mid - m spectral type and interior structure ( fully convective ) as the low - mass end of morales et al.s sample , do exhibit strong differences in rotation and activity , and evince precisely the same trend ( more active component is less luminous and larger than expected ) as the field dwarfs , the role of activity / magnetic fields in determining the properties of  can not be discounted either .",
    "it therefore appears plausible that both age and rotation / field effects are important for understanding the  reversal in .",
    "indeed , this may resolve the problem of uncomfortably low  derived in the cbg07 analysis : if non - coevality ( of @xmath20 0.5 myr ) moves the system _ partially _ towards  reversal , the remainder of the reversal may be effected by rotation / field effects using temperatures more in line with the higher values espoused here and by s07/r07 .",
    "finally , we emphasize the importance of pinning down the potential effects of rotation / fields in young low - mass objects for determining the overall imf of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs . a large fraction of young , non - accreting brown dwarfs rotate significantly faster than not only the  secondary , but than the primary as well ; many of these also have h@xmath69 ews , and thus presumably field strengths , comparable to the primary s @xcite .",
    "if rotation / field effects are important , as the results for  and the field dwarfs suggest , the masses of these objects obtained from comparisons to the usual evolutionary tracks ( which do not include such effects ) are possibly significantly incorrect ( analogous to the situation for the  primary ; see fig .",
    "[ subu - fig ] and  5.1 ) , and thus so is the derived imf .",
    "is an extremely fortuitous find in this regard , not only because it is an eb , but also because its two components represent both classes of brown dwarfs : rapidly rotating highly active ones , and slowly rotating weakly active ones .",
    "a good physical understanding of both components is essential for an accurate description of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs and low - mass stars .",
