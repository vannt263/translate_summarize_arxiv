    "the study of few - boson systems close to the unitary limit is an intense subject of research nowadays . for identical bosons ,",
    "the unitary limit is defined when the two - body scattering length @xmath8 . in this limit",
    "the three - boson system shows the efimov effect  @xcite .",
    "moreover , close to the unitary limit the system manifests universal behavior : the details of the two - body interaction are not important and its spectrum is determined essentially by @xmath1 and the three - body parameter @xmath0 which defines the energy @xmath9 of level @xmath10 at the unitary limit , here @xmath11 is the boson mass ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the unitary limit",
    "the spectrum shows a discrete scaling invariance ( dsi ) : an infinite series of bound states appears distributed geometrically and accumulates at zero energy .",
    "the ratio of two consecutive energy states is constant , @xmath12 , with the universal number @xmath13 .",
    "the universal characteristics of the system can be exploited studying the dynamics using potential models constructed in such a way that the control parameters of the spectrum are reproduced .",
    "for example a two - parameter potential as a gaussian can be used to this aim  @xcite .",
    "universal behavior manifests in a simple dependence of many observables on the angle defined by the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "this is the case of the product @xmath14 and , in the case in which the two bosons forms a dimer , the ratio @xmath5 between the boson - dimer scattering length @xmath6 and the two - body scattering length @xmath1 .",
    "these relations are exactly fulfilled in the zero - range limit and , as we will show , range corrections can be introduced using the potential models .",
    "in fact the gaussian potentials can be used to determine the dependence on the angle @xmath3 of the observables defined above .",
    "the first one , @xmath14 , is used to define the gaussian level function  @xcite .",
    "moreover a gaussian potential verifying @xmath4 can be used to compute the ratio @xmath5 at that angle .",
    "after introducing range corrections we compute this ratio and , as an application , we determine @xmath6 for the case of a system composed by three @xmath7he atoms .",
    "in the case of a zero - range interaction the @xmath15 spectrum of three bosons is determined by the efimov radial law @xmath16 [ eq : energyzr ] where @xmath1 is the two - body scattering length and @xmath17 is the energy of level @xmath18 . the binding momentum @xmath0 gives the energy of the system at the unitary limit .",
    "the spectrum is determined by the knowledge of the universal function @xmath19 which is equal for all levels ( a parametrization of the universal function is given in  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact knowing one energy value the complete spectrum is determined .",
    "the zero - range theory is not always sufficiently accurate to describe real systems and range corrections have to be introduced at some level .",
    "since close to the unitary limit the details of the interaction are not important , it is possible to construct a potential model in order to capture the essential ingredients of the dynamics . following this strategy a minimal information that preserves universal behavior",
    "is encoded in the effective range expansion for two particles , @xmath20 . with @xmath21 the relative momentum and",
    "@xmath22 the effective range . at low energies this perturbative expansion",
    "is well fulfilled and , in the case of shallow states , it can be extended to negative energies relating @xmath1 , @xmath22 and the two - body energy @xmath23 : @xmath24 where we have introduced the energy length from the relation @xmath25 .",
    "therefore a two - parameter potential describing @xmath23 and @xmath1 will also describe @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly we define a local and a non local gaussian potential @xmath26 with the strengths @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the ranges @xmath29 , @xmath30 determined to describe particular values of @xmath1 and @xmath23 of a two - boson system . if these values are experimental values we call this set of values a physical point .",
    "once this point is fixed the strength of the potential can be varied to reach the unitary limit . with the potentials defined above the lengths , momenta and energies",
    "scale with @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore the local gaussian ( lg ) and the nonlocal gaussian ( nlg ) potentials define a particular path to the unitary limit that encompasses all the local and nonlocal gassian potentials .",
    "in particular , for the ground state , the values of the effective range and strength at unitary are @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( local gaussian ) and @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( nonlocal gaussian ) .",
    "the potentials defined in eqs.([eq : pot1],[eq : pot2 ] ) can be used to describe the three - boson system close to the unitary limit .",
    "the efimov law of eq.([eq : energyzr ] ) suggests the following representation of the gaussian @xmath15 spectrum of three - bosons @xmath38 [ eq : energyfr ] where @xmath39 defines the energy of level @xmath18 at the unitary limit , @xmath40 , and the gaussian level function is defined as @xmath41 the scaling properties of the gaussian potentials are such that the level function is the same for all local gaussian and for all nonlocal gaussian , being the local and nonlocal level functions slightly different for the ground state level @xmath42 . as @xmath43 both level functions tend to be equal and tend to the zero - range function , @xmath44 .",
    "this behavior is show in fig.1 in which the lg and nlg level functions @xmath45 are shown for the ground and first excited state levels @xmath46 .",
    "the universal zero - range function is shown as well and completely overlap with the nlg level function calculated for the third excited state @xmath47 .",
    "in particular the ground state level function @xmath48 incorporate range corrections and can be used to determine the corresponding three - body parameter @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "are shown for the ground state and first excited state levels @xmath46 . in the nlg case the third excited state ( @xmath50 ) level function @xmath47 ( red circles )",
    "completely overlap with the zero - range universal function @xmath19 ( red solid curve ) . ]",
    "we now discuss the @xmath3 dependence of the ratio @xmath5 .",
    "as discussed by efimov  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in the zero - range limit , the ratio @xmath5 has the form @xmath51\\ ] ] with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 universal numbers ( numerical values are given in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the @xmath3 dependence of the product @xmath2 , the above ratio depends on this angle too .",
    "accordingly it is possible to study this ratio using potentials models .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce range corrections by studying the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "we calculate it for different values of @xmath3 and , in particular , we consider valid the following relation at the same @xmath3 value : @xmath56 where the first ratio refers to the values predicted by any realistic interaction or experimental values whereas @xmath57 refers to the values calculated with the lg or nlg potentials . as an application we calculate the value of the atom - dimer scattering length @xmath6 for a system composed by three @xmath7he atoms .",
    "this system is well described by the realistic lm2m2 potential of aziz  @xcite for which @xmath58mk . using this potential",
    "the three - boson ground state energy is @xmath59mk and , accordingly , the angle @xmath3 is obtained from @xmath60 this ratio can be reproduced using a gaussian potential and with that potential the value of @xmath6 can be calculated using standard methods . after this straightforward procedure",
    "we obtain @xmath61 to be compared to @xmath62a@xmath63 obtained from a direct calculation using the lm2m2 interaction  @xcite .",
    "as can we see the simple dependence of the ratio @xmath55 on the angle @xmath3 is well fulfilled and , furthermore , the gaussian description reproduces this dependence with good approximation .",
    "we have studied the three - boson system using potential models of the gaussian form .",
    "this simple representation of the interaction seems to capture the main aspects of the low energy dynamics close to the unitary limit .",
    "we have looked at the ratio @xmath64 defining the angle @xmath3 . at the unitary limit it corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "the dsi manifests at fixed values of @xmath3 , this means that the infinite series of states observed at @xmath65 can be observed also along the line in which @xmath3 remains constant and the energy ratios along that line verify the same relation @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noticed that the case @xmath65 corresponds to a single value of @xmath23 ( equal to zero ) , whereas @xmath23 varies along the line in which @xmath3 is constant and therefore the values of @xmath23 at which @xmath66 and @xmath67 are calculate are different .",
    "this property allows to study dsi at finite values of @xmath23 .    in the present work",
    "we have exploited the property that some observables close to the unitary limit have a simple dependence , they are functions of the angle @xmath3 .",
    "first we have analysed the product @xmath68 from which we have defined the gaussian level function @xmath45 . in second place",
    "we have analysed the ratio @xmath55 and the gaussian values for this ratio have been used to determine @xmath6 for the case of atom - dimer collision of three @xmath7he atoms at zero energy .",
    "from the results we observe that @xmath3 dependence is well verified and , the gaussian model reproduces well the lm2m2 value for @xmath6 .",
    "further investigations along this line are under way .",
