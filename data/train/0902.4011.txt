    "in this paper , permutations are of the letters @xmath8 ( for various @xmath9 ) and a _ pattern _ in a permutation @xmath10 is a subsequence in @xmath10 , the relative sizes of whose elements come in some prescribed order . for example , a @xmath11-pattern is simply an increasing subsequence of length three .",
    "the permutation @xmath12 has two _ occurrences _ of the pattern @xmath11 , namely the subsequences @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the permutation @xmath12 also has one occurrence of the pattern @xmath15 , namely the subsequence @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to see that the set of all permutations ( of arbitrary , positive , numbers of letters ) forms a graded poset @xmath2 with respect to pattern containment .",
    "that is , a permutation @xmath1 is smaller than another permutation @xmath0 in @xmath2 if @xmath1 occurs as a pattern in @xmath0 .",
    "a classical problem for any poset , first explicitly mentioned by wilf @xcite in this particular case , is to understand its mbius function @xmath17 . the first result so far in this direction was given by sagan and vatter @xcite , who solved the problem in the case of _ layered _ permutations .",
    "they noted that the poset of layered permutations is isomorphic to a certain poset of compositions of an integer , and they gave a formula for computing the mbius function of that poset .",
    "a permutation is layered if it is the concatenation of decreasing sequences , where the letters in each sequence are smaller than all letters in later sequences .",
    "an example of such a permutation is @xmath18 .    looking at examples of the mbius function of intervals in the pattern poset , it is easy to infer that this is hard to understand in the general case . in particular ,",
    "the mbius function for this poset does not alternate in sign with rank , which is a discouraging starting point .    in this paper , we present some results for this problem .",
    "most of our results stem from looking at particular occurrences of a pattern @xmath1 in a permutation @xmath0 and analyzing the complement in @xmath0 of an occurrence .",
    "in particular , in section  [ section : interval blocks ] , we give a large class of pairs of permutations @xmath1 and @xmath0 for which the mbius function of the interval @xmath6 $ ] is 0 ( theorem  [ thm : interval blocks ] ) .",
    "these intervals occur when there is a sequence of consecutive letters of @xmath0 that are not in any occurrence of @xmath1 , and which form an interval of values @xmath19 for some @xmath20 and some @xmath21 .",
    "one such pair is @xmath22 : no letter of the contiguous subsequence @xmath23 belongs to any occurrence of the pattern @xmath24 in @xmath25 .    in section  [ section : fixed occurrence ] , we solve the problem in the case where @xmath1 occurs precisely once in @xmath0 and the complement of @xmath1 in @xmath0 satisfies certain conditions .",
    "the mbius function in this case is either @xmath4 , @xmath3 , or  @xmath5 ( corollary  [ cor : single occurrence ] ) .",
    "this follows from a more general result ( theorem  [ thm : fixed occurrence ] ) about a particular kind of fixed occurrence of @xmath1 in @xmath0 .",
    "we believe that there are other interesting classes of intervals also having mbius function @xmath4 , @xmath3 or @xmath5 , as we explain below .    in the final section , we conjecture that if the permutations in an interval @xmath6 $ ] avoid the pattern @xmath24 ( equivalently , if @xmath0 avoids @xmath24 ) , then the absolute value of the mbius function of @xmath6 $ ] is bounded by the number of occurrences of @xmath1 in @xmath0 . due to the symmetries among @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "the pattern @xmath24 can be replaced by any one of the other three patterns in this conjecture .",
    "thus , this conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that if the absolute value of the mbius function of an interval @xmath6 $ ] exceeds the number of occurrences of @xmath1 in @xmath0 then @xmath0 must contain all of the patterns @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "we now come to the definitions of the conditions under which the mbius function of an interval free pair @xmath100 can be shown to be either @xmath5 or @xmath4 , depending only on the rank of the interval .",
    "note that there is a relationship between the following definition and the notion of `` separated '' ( see definition [ defn : separated ] ) .",
    "two letters @xmath20 and @xmath220 , with @xmath221 , in the complement of @xmath1 in @xmath0 are _ similar _ if they are in the same region and there is no @xmath222 such that @xmath223 .",

    "the letters 5 and 7 are similar , because the only letter between them in value , namely 6 , belongs to the complement of @xmath47 .",

    "suppose that there is no maximal group ; that is , no two letters in the same region are similar",
    ". then the pair @xmath100 is separated , so , by theorem  [ thm : boolean algebra ] , the interval @xmath192 is a nontrivial boolean algebra , which is .",
    "now suppose that there is a unique maximal group of similar letters , and that it consists of @xmath231 letters .",
    "we prove the result by induction on @xmath232 .    if @xmath233 , then the entire complement @xmath59 is this group of @xmath234 similar letters , which forms an interval block .",
    "thus @xmath211 consists of two elements : the element @xmath47 and the element obtained by adding to @xmath47 a single letter from the complement @xmath59 .",
    "this poset is obviously .",
    "now assume the result for all @xmath235 , where @xmath236 and suppose that @xmath237 .",

    "the only counterexample in that case , up to trivial symmetries , is when @xmath241 and @xmath242 ( we use commas here to clarify which values are two - digit numbers ) .",
    "the only occurrence of @xmath1 in @xmath0 here is @xmath243 , so the complement is @xmath244 , which has no interval blocks , but @xmath151 .",
    "another counterexample , where the mbius function has value @xmath140 , is @xmath245 here the only occurrence of @xmath246 is @xmath247 .",

    "thus , the combined contrapositives of the corresponding four conjectures say that if @xmath250 exceeds @xmath80 , then @xmath0 must contain all of the patterns @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "observe that if conjecture [ conj:132 ] holds , then , for intervals @xmath6 $ ] where @xmath1 occurs precisely once in @xmath0 , the mbius function must be @xmath3 , @xmath5 or @xmath4 .    additionally , recalling section  [ section : fixed occurrence ] , it would be interesting to characterize the boolean intervals in the poset of permutation patterns .",
