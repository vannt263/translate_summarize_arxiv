    "the origin of the divergences is that , for modes with extremely small wavelengths , it is unphysical to assume a sharp boundary , since the transition region between media becomes larger than the wavelength of the high frequency modes .    the problem of the divergences in the self - energies has been considered in flat spacetime in a series of works by graham et al @xcite . it was pointed out that , if the boundary conditions are replaced by an interaction with a second field , the model is renormalizable and the self - energies are not divergent . in those works ,",

    "it is sufficient to require @xmath100 to be an integrable @xmath133 function , since then its fourier transform falls off faster than @xmath134 .",
    "however , for the simple particular example of a mirror similar to ( [ mirrorcont ] ) but with polynomials with higher degree of continuity interpolating between @xmath135 and @xmath136 , we have checked that @xmath101 continuity of @xmath100 is enough to render the result finite .",

    "the examples described in ref.@xcite refer to the vacuum polarization around spherically symmetric objects , and divergences show up for sharp interfaces , where the matter density is discontinuous .",
    "the divergences disappear when the matter density and its first two derivatives are continuous across the interface .",
    "similarly , in a cosmological context , divergences in the renormalized energy - momentum tensor are removed when one replaces an abrupt transition of the scale factor by a smoother transition in which the scale factor and its two first derivatives are continuous .",

    "@xcite .",
    "high vacuum energy densities in the presence of boundaries may potentially produce large gravitational effects . in our model , the usual divergences are rendered finite when the sharp boundary is replaced by a sufficiently smooth background field .",
    "however , the quantum vacuum energy does attain high values if the background field varies over short distances .",
    "we can make a crude estimation of the maximum value of the energy density using dimensional analysis . from eq.([fourierdobletmunu ] ) , it is not difficult to see that if @xmath100 is varying over distances of order @xmath116 then we should expect the maximum value of @xmath131 to be of order @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is a representative value attained by @xmath100 . the quantity @xmath139 has units of ( length)@xmath140 , and determines the properties of the mirror .",

    "as expected , the divergences in the renormalized energy - momentum tensor noticed in previous works only appear when considering unphysical limits of perfect conductivity and/or sharp interfaces , that in our model would correspond to take a non - smooth background field .",
