    "the development of a robust and reliable estimator of the pose ( i.e. position and attitude ) of a rigid body is a key requirement for robust and high performance control of robotic vehicles .",
    "pose estimation is a highly nonlinear problem in which the sensors normally utilized are prone to non - gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "classical approaches for state estimation are based on nonlinear filtering techniques such as extended kalman filters , unscented kalman filters or particle filters .",
    "however , nonlinear observers have become an alternative to these classical techniques , starting with the work of salcudean @xcite for attitude estimation and subsequent contributions over the last two decades @xcite .",
    "early nonlinear attitude observers have been developed on the basis of lyapunov analysis .",
    "recently , the attitude estimation problem has motivated the development of theories on invariant observers for systems endowed with symmetry properties @xcite .",
    "for instance , complementary nonlinear attitude observers exploiting the underlying lie group structure of the special orthogonal group @xmath1 are derived in @xcite with proofs of almost global stability of the error system . a symmetry - preserving nonlinear observer design based on the cartan moving - frame method",
    "is proposed in @xcite , which is locally valid for arbitrary lie groups .",
    "a gradient - like observer design technique for invariant systems on lie groups is proposed in @xcite , leading to almost global convergence provided that a non - degenerate morse - bott cost function is used .",
    "more recently , an observer design method directly on the homogeneous output space for the kinematics of mechanical systems is proposed in @xcite , leading to autonomous error evolution and strong convergence properties .",
    "finally , @xcite extends the observer design methodology proposed in @xcite in order to deal with the case where the measurement of system input is corrupted by an unknown constant bias .",
    "full pose observer design , although less studied than attitude observer design , has recently attracted more attention @xcite .",
    "for instance , observers designed directly on @xmath0 have been proposed using both full state feedback @xcite or bearing measurements of known landmarks @xcite .",
    "an observer on @xmath2 is proposed in @xcite , using full range and bearing measurements of known landmarks and achieving almost global asymptotic stability . in a prior work by the authors @xcite , a nonlinear observer on @xmath0 is proposed using directly position measurements in the body - fixed frame of known inertial feature points or landmarks , with motivation strongly related to robotic vision applications using either stereo camera or kinect sensor .",
    "the observer derivation is based on the gradient - like observer design technique proposed in @xcite , and the almost global asymptotic stability of the error system is proved by means of lyapunov analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the question of deriving a nonlinear observer on @xmath0 for full pose estimation that takes the system outputs on the real projective space @xmath3 directly as inputs . a key advance on our prior work @xcite is the possibility of incorporating `` naturally '' in a sole observer both vectorial measurements ( provided e.g. by magnetometers or inclinometers ) and position measurements of known inertial feature points ( provided e.g. by stereo camera ) .",
    "in addition , sharing the same robustness property with the observer proposed in @xcite , the algorithm here proposed is also well - posed even when there is insufficient data for full pose reconstruction using algebraic techniques . in such situations , the proposed observer continues to operate , incorporating what information is available and relying on propagation of prior estimates where necessary . finally , as a complementary contribution , a modified version of the basic observer",
    "is proposed so as to deal with the case where bias is present in the velocity measurements .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : preliminary ] formally introduces the problem of pose estimation on @xmath0 along with the notation used . in section iii ,",
    "based on a recent advanced theory for nonlinear observer design directly on the output space @xcite , a nonlinear observer on @xmath0 is proposed using direct body - fixed measurements of known inertial elements of the real projective space @xmath3 and the knowledge of the group velocity .",
    "stability analysis is also provided in this section .",
    "then , in section [ sec : observerdesignbias ] the proposed basic observer is extended using lyapunov theory in order to cope with the case where the measurement data of the group velocity are corrupted by an unknown constant bias . in section [ sec :",
    "simulation ] , the performance of the proposed observers are validated by means of simulation . finally , concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
