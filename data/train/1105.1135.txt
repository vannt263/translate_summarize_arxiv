    "the recent discovery of a new family of iron - based superconductors @xmath5@xcite has initiated a new round of research in this field . remarkably , this new family shows distinctly different properties from other pnictide families : the compounds are heavily electron doped , but their superconducting transition temperatures are high , at more than @xmath6 k. for comparison , such large @xmath7 s can only be reached in the optimally doped 122 iron pnictides  @xcite .",
    "importantly , both angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite and lda calculations@xcite show the presence of only electron fermi pockets located at the @xmath8 point of the folded brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "( some signature of possible density of states at the @xmath9 point is still under current debate ; in any case this pocket , if present , is assumed to be very flat and shallow ) .",
    "arpes experiments have also reported large isotropic superconducting gaps at these pockets@xcite . the absence of hole pockets around the @xmath9 point of the bz provides a new arena of fermi surface topology to investigate the pairing symmetries and mechanisms of superconductivity proposed for iron - based superconductors from a variety of different approaches@xcite .",
    "so far , the majority of theories for the pairing symmetry of iron - based superconductors are based on weak coupling approaches@xcite .",
    "although there are discrepancies , the theories based on these approaches have reached a broad consensus regarding the pairing symmetries in iron - based superconductors : for optimally hole doped iron - pnictides , for example , @xmath10 , an extended @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry , called @xmath11 , is favored@xcite ( the sign of the order parameter changes between hole and electron pockets as potentially detectable through neutron scattering  @xcite ) , as a result of repulsive interband interactions and nesting between the hole and electron pockets .",
    "for extremely hole - doped materials , such as @xmath12 , the absence of electron pockets can lead to a @xmath2-wave pairing symmetry@xcite with a low transition temperature ; for electron doped materials such as @xmath13 , the anisotropy of the superconducting gap around the electron pockets in the @xmath11 state grows for larger electron doping and eventually the sc gap develops nodes around the electron pockets due to the weakening of the nesting condition and the increase of @xmath14 orbital weight at the electron pocket fermi surfaces@xcite .",
    "finally , in the limit of the heavily electron doped case when the hole pockets vanish and only the electron pockets are left , the @xmath2-wave pairing symmetry may be favored again@xcite .",
    "the iron chalcogenide @xmath15 belongs to the latter category and many theories based on weak coupling approaches have suggested that the pairing symmetry should be @xmath2-wave as possibly detectable through characteristic impurity scattering@xcite .",
    "a complementary approach based on strong coupling likewise predicts an @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry in the iron pnictides .",
    "two of us showed that the pairing symmetry is determined mainly by the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) afm exchange coupling @xmath4 together with a renormalized narrow band width@xcite .",
    "the superconducting gap is close to a @xmath16 form in momentum space ( higher harmonic contributions are neglected in this approach ) .",
    "this result is model independent as long as the dominating interaction is @xmath4 and the fermi surfaces are located close to the @xmath9 and m points in the folded bz .",
    "the @xmath17 form factor changes sign between the electron and hole pockets in the bz .",
    "it resembles the order parameters of @xmath11 proposed from weak - coupling arguments@xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 coupling will be of particular importance in the following .",
    "we point out two key points on @xmath4-related physics as it has appeared in the literature up to now .",
    "first , the effect of @xmath4 is underestimated in most analytic models constructed based on the pure iron lattice with only onsite interactions since the @xmath4 exchange coupling originates mostly from superexchange processes through as ( p ) or se ( te ) .",
    "second , in the effective @xmath18 model studied before@xcite , the superconducting state is obtained only when the magnetic exchange coupling strength is of the same order as the hopping parameters ( or the bandwidth ) of the model .",
    "therefore , as @xmath19 , it requires the effective bands given by @xmath20 be renormalized .",
    "however , the absence of double occupancies in the standard @xmath21 model is not strictly imposed in such an intermediately coupled effective model where the bandwidth is assumed to be of similar order as the interaction scale .    comparing the predictions from weak coupling and strong coupling ,",
    "the 122 iron chalcogenides provide an interesting opportunity to address the difference between the two perspectives . in this paper",
    ", we predict that the @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry is robust even in extremely electron - overdoped iron chalcogenides because the afm @xmath4 is the main factor for pairing and the @xmath22 is _ ferromagnetic _ ( fm ) , a conclusion drawn from both neutron scattering experiments@xcite and the magnetic structure associated with 245 vacancy ordering@xcite . as we will show , the fm @xmath22 significantly reduces the competitiveness of @xmath2-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "we substantiate this claim by two different methods .",
    "first , we solve the three orbital @xmath18 model on the mean field level to show that the @xmath0-wave pairing is the leading instability regardless of the change of doping given that @xmath4 is large .",
    "we calculate a full phase diagram as @xmath22 varies from fm to afm .",
    "if @xmath22 is afm , we obtain a sc state with a mixed s - wave and d - wave pairing .",
    "second , we use the functional renormalization group ( frg ) to analyze this trend obtained by mean field analysis for a 5-band model of the chalcogenides .",
    "we confirm that a dominant afm @xmath4 generally leads to robust @xmath0-wave pairing while an afm @xmath22 tends to favor @xmath2-wave pairing in the electron overdoped region .",
    "the competition between @xmath0-wave and @xmath2-wave weakens the superconducting instability scale .",
    "in addition , it drives the anisotropy feature of the superconducting form factor as consistently obtained for various weak coupling approaches .",
    "together , our analysis provides an explanation for the different behavior of superconductivity in the iron pnictides and iron chalcogenides in the electron overdoped region since @xmath22 has opposite signs for these two classes of materials , i. e. @xmath22 is afm in the iron pnictides@xcite and fm in the iron chalcogenides .",
    "our study suggests that determining the pairing symmetry of the 122 iron chalcogenides can provide important insight regarding whether the local afm exchange couplings are responsible for the high superconducting transition temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "mfa ] , we present the mean field analysis of the @xmath23 model to show the differences between the iron pnictide setup @xmath24 and the chalcogenide setup @xmath25 in the electron - overdoped regime .",
    "this is followed by frg studies in section  [ sec : frg ] where we mainly investigate the competition between @xmath0-wave and @xmath2-wave in the effective model , and also analyze the possible effect of an additional pocket at the @xmath9 point of the unfolded bz which we find to further increase the robustness of the @xmath0-wave pairing .",

    "[ sec : mfa ] . in section",
    "[ sec : dis ] we provide a combined view on the chalcogenides and point out that the ferromagnetic sign of @xmath22 is important to explain the robustness of @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry in these compounds .",
    "furthermore , we set our work into context of other approaches to the problem . we conclude in section  [ sec : con ] that electron - overdoped chalcogenides exhibit a robust @xmath0-wave pairing phase when the nnn interactions are correctly taken into consideration .",
    "we calculate the mean - field diagram of an effective model for the afe@xmath26se@xmath26 compounds . as the main relevant orbital weight",

    "if both of them are afm , there is strong competition between the @xmath0-wave and @xmath2-wave pairing .",
    "when there are hole pockets , as shown before@xcite , even in a range of @xmath107 , the contribution to pairing from @xmath22 is much weaker than the one from @xmath4 . in that case , an afm @xmath22 will not generate strong @xmath2-wave pairing so that the @xmath0-wave wins easily . from neutron scattering experiments , it has been shown that a major difference between iron - pnictides and iron - chalcogenides is that the nn coupling @xmath22 change from afm in the former@xcite to fm in the latter@xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath22 is rather strongly fm in the latter , which explains the high magnetic transition temperature ( @xmath108 k ) in the 245 vacancy ordering state as shown in ref .  .",
    "combining these results , we can partially answer the question regarding the different behaviors between iron - pnictides and iron - chacogenides in the electron - overdoped region : why can the high sc transition temperature be achieved in the latter , but not in the former ? since @xmath22 in iron - pnictides is afm while it is fm in iron - chacogenides , @xmath22 will weaken the sc pairing in the former but not in the latter .    a few remarks regarding this work follow : ( i ) our mean - field result is qualitatively consistent with the results from a similar model with five orbitals@xcite .",
    "the critical difference is regarding @xmath22 being fm , and has not been addressed previously ; ( ii ) @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry has also been obtained in refs .  .",
    "however , the @xmath0-wave pairing only shows up either in a narrow region or with drastically different parameter settings .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-wave is not robust from a microscopic point of view . instead , the @xmath2-wave is a robust result in these studies .",
    "still , even the @xmath2-wave pairing strength based on the scattering between two electron pockets is generally weak , as specifically discussed in@xcite , which is another difficulty for this type of mechanism .",
    "( iii ) our results suggest that there is no difference between iron - pnictides and iron - chalcogenides in terms of pairing symmetry .",
    "both of them are dominated by @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "if both hole and electron pockets are present , the signs of the sc order in hole and electron pockets are opposite , namely @xmath11 . however , the mechanism causing @xmath11 is different in the weak and strong coupling approach . in the weak coupling approach ,",
    "the sign change is due to the scattering between the hole and electron pockets while in the strong coupling approach , the sign change is due to the form factor of the sc order parameters which is specified to be @xmath17 since the pairing mainly originates from the afm @xmath4 . therefore , to obtain @xmath11 pairing symmetry , the existence of both hole and electron pockets is necessary in the weak coupling approach , but not in the strong coupling one .",
    "( iv ) the reason that the superconductivity vanishes in the iron pnictides in the electron overdoped region is not solely due to the competition between @xmath0-wave and @xmath2-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "it is also due to the weakening of local magnetic exchange coupling themselves and the reduction of band width renormalization .",
    "( v ) the prospective experimental confirmation of @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry in @xmath109 will support that superconductivity in iron - based superconductors might be explained by local afm exchange couplings .",
    "( vi ) neutron scattering also suggests that there is significant afm exchange coupling between two third nearest neighbor sites , i.e. @xmath110@xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath110 will further enhance the @xmath0-wave pairing since it generates pairing form factors as @xmath111 in reciprocal space which in turn can enhance the pairing at the electron pockets .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the pairing symmetry in electron - overdoped iron - chalcogenides is a robust @xmath0-wave .",
