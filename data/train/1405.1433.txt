    "dynamical processes in rotating spacetimes are notoriously difficult to model analytically . in fact , there exist very few exact solutions in closed form describing collapsing matter carrying angular momentum .",
    "a few notable exceptions were obtained in @xmath0 dimensions , where the problem naturally becomes more tractable  @xcite ( see  @xcite for four - dimensional , but cylindrically symmetric , studies ) .",
    "the aim of this letter is to construct exact rotating solutions to the einstein field equations in five spacetime dimensions involving matter shells around black holes . in particular , these solutions allow to address for the first time the effect of rotation on the gravitational collapse in an exact manner in a scenario with more than two spatial dimensions .",
    "our setup consists of a gravitating thin rotating shell in five dimensions , which backreacts on the geometry of a black hole .",
    "we allow for the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "our construction relies on the well known darmois - israel formalism  @xcite for matching two spacetimes along a spacelike hypersurface .",

    "more recently it was extended to the rotating case and to shells with pressure in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see  @xcite for an early study in four dimensions employing a slow rotation approximation ) .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions is not straightforward at all , the reason being that the spacetime will typically depend non trivially on polar angles in addition to a radial coordinate , thus rendering the matching procedure intractable on analytic grounds .",
    "however , it is possible to make progress by restricting to the class of higher ( odd ) dimensional black holes with all  generically independent  angular momenta equal : in this case the problem is cohomogeneity-1  @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we develop the formalism in @xmath1 dimensions but similar results are expected for higher odd dimensions .    throughout the manuscript we use geometrized units , by setting both the speed of light @xmath2 and newton s constant @xmath3 equal to one .",
    "the rotating black hole geometry generalizing the kerr solution to higher dimensions is the well known myers - perry black hole  @xcite , which has been extended to include a cosmological constant in  @xcite .",
    "five - dimensional spacetimes admit two orthogonal rotation planes , and consequently two independent angular momenta . when the two angular momenta are equal , the isometry group of the solution gets enhanced and the metric functions can be written in terms of a single coordinate @xmath4  @xcite : ds^2 & = & - f(r)^2 dt^2 + g(r)^2 dr^2 + r^2 _ ab dx^a dx^b + & & + h(r)^2 ^2 , [ eq : metric ] where g(r)^2 & = & ( 1 + - + ) ^-1 , [ eq : metricfuncs1 ] + h(r)^2 & = & r^2 ( 1 + ) , ( r ) = , [ eq : metricfuncs2 ] + f(r ) & = & , = 1 - , [ eq : metricfuncs3 ] and with @xmath5 and @xmath6 given by _ ab dx^a",

    ". we also note that in the flat limit , the only possibility to describe a collapse starting at rest from infinity occurs for the choice of dust ( @xmath59 ) and only if the condition @xmath66 is satisfied .",
    "for a such a collapse , the energy of the spacetime will be enhanced by the rest mass of the shell .",
    "as an illustration , we now provide an explicit example of a rotating dust thin shell collapsing from rest at infinity onto a ( small ) rotating black hole in an asymptotically minkowski spacetime .",
    "this is to the best of our knowledge the first exact solution of this sort in more than three spacetime dimensions .    in accordance with the above results we now take @xmath11 , set @xmath59 and @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to find conditions on the remaining parameters @xmath68 so that the effective potential is strictly negative ( corresponding to a full collapse ) and the eigenvalues of the stress - energy tensor are real and nonnegative ( required for the weak energy conditions to be satisfied ) . in figure  [ fig : flatcollapse ] we show these quantities as functions of the radial location of the shell .",
    "a convenient choice of parameters was made for illustration purposes but we stress that no fine tuning is necessary .",

    "both the mass and spin of the initial black hole have changed .",
    "eventually the shell falls into the curvature singularity at @xmath75 , where the stress - energy components also blow up .    note that none of the collapsing solutions we have described violate the cosmic censorship conjecture  @xcite :",

    "this particular plot corresponds to parameters @xmath80 ( in arbitrary units ) , which are chosen in such a way that the collapse is complete.,width=325 ]",
    "given the ` confining ' nature of the effective potential in the presence of a negative cosmological constant ( and when @xmath81 ) , as well as the existence of a centrifugal barrier , we expect that stationary solutions consisting of a rotating shell hovering around a black hole exist in ads .",
    "such solutions can be constructed as follows .",
    "we assume that ( i ) the radial location of the shell is constant , i.e. , @xmath82 , implying that @xmath83 , and that ( ii ) it corresponds to a local minimum of the potential , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "in general , these conditions involve high order polynomial equations in @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "the conditions are simple quadratic equations in @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to fix the masses of the inner and outer space in terms of the remaining parameters , @xmath89 .",
    "this can be done in such a way to ensure that @xmath90 is a stable point .",
    "then one just needs to scan the parameter space to obtain solutions for which the inner geometry possesses an event horizon , while the outer geometry has no horizons , and satisfy the wec .",
    "it is easy to find such solutions and we show an example in figure  [ fig : stationaryshell ] .",
    "we mention in passing the existence of unstable stationary solutions in flat space , where the gravitational attraction is balanced by the centrifugal repulsion .",
    "these configurations are obtained by tuning the parameters so that the potential of fig .",
    "[ fig : flatcollapse ] acquires a maximum with @xmath91 value .     of the shell .",

    "the event horizon radius @xmath98 is given by the largest real root of @xmath99 .",
    "the brown curve represents the effective radial potential ( amplified to ease interpretation ) and @xmath97 corresponds to a local minimum of the potential .",
    "we chose the following values of parameters for this plot : @xmath100.,width=329 ]",
    "in this letter we showed it is possible to address non spherical gravitational collapse with analytic tools and nonperturbatively , even without restricting to lower dimensional spacetimes .",
    "in particular , we developed the formalism to study the motion of rotating thin shells in equal angular momenta black hole spacetimes in five dimensions , allowing for a cosmological constant .",
    "the consideration of five dimensions is not physically fundamental : we regard it as a technical crutch to make progress analytically .",
    "we also stress that , while the symmetry required for the success of our analysis is enhanced relative to the case with arbitrary angular momenta ( @xmath101 compered to @xmath102 ) , it is still more generic than the spherically symmetric situation , which has isometry group @xmath103 .",
    "the most important lesson borne out by this work is that anisotropic pressures and intrinsic momentum are necessarily generated when rotation is present .",
    "this result is independent of the shell equation of state and is expected to hold even in less symmetric collapse scenarios .",
    "we further believe that the departure of the stress - energy tensor from the perfect fluid form is typical of collapse with rotation also in less idealized cases , in which the shell has finite thickness .",
    "in particular , we expect numerical simulations of gravitational collapse to display this feature .",
    "we presented two examples of exact solutions : a full collapse with rotation onto an asymptotically flat black hole and a stationary configuration of matter around a rotating black hole in ads .",
