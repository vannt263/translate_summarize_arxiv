    "during the last ten years , the class of nickel borocarbide compounds _",
    "r_ni@xmath1b@xmath1c , where _ r _ = sc , y , lu , dy , ho , er , tm and other rare - earth ions , has attracted considerable attention in the superconducting community @xcite .",
    "this interest is caused by the unusual properties of these materials related to the rich interplay of superconductivity and magnetism , when _ r _ is a magnetic rare - earth ion . in this context",
    ", it is remarkable that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 can be higher than the nel temperature @xmath11 as for _ r_=tm and er , but also comparable with @xmath11 as for _ r_=ho and even lower than @xmath11 as for _ r_=dy .",
    "non - magnetic compounds with _",
    "r_=sc , y and lu have the highest @xmath2 values of 15k , 15.5k and 16.5k , respectively .",
    "they are type ii superconductors and have three - dimensional , practically isotropic electronic structure , while their crystal structure comprises alternating _ r_c and n@xmath1b@xmath1 layers .",
    "noteworthy recent experiments including tunnelling @xcite and point contact measurements @xcite on bulk single crystals have shown that the unusual superconducting properties of nickel borocarbides exhibit strong anisotropy .",
    "in particular , a hybrid @xmath12 wave superconducting state has been proposed @xcite for the compounds with _",
    "r _ = y and lu , characterized by four point nodes of the superconducting order parameter in the [ @xmath131,0,0 ] and [ 0,@xmath131,0 ] directions .",
    "this conclusion was based on investigations of the angular dependence of the thermal conductivity @xcite and specific heat @xcite under an applied external magnetic field of single crystals at low temperatures .",
    "point - contact measurements @xcite also revealed a strong gap anisotropy . in the [ 100 ] direction ,",
    "not only the gap is 4.5 times smaller , but also the transition temperature was found to be half ( ! ) that in the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "it is also important to note that a thorough analysis of upper critical field @xmath14 data for yni@xmath1b@xmath1c and luni@xmath1b@xmath1c single crystals clearly showed that superconductivity in these compounds is strongly affected by their multiband nature @xcite . in order to gain further insight into the interplay of the symmetry of superconducting order parameters , their anisotropy and multiband nature , additional studies are necessary . in the present work ,",
    "direct measurements of the gap amplitude distribution have been performed on epitaxial _",
    "c _ axis oriented yni@xmath1b@xmath1c thin film using point - contact spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we present the results of point contact measurements made on a high quality yni@xmath1b@xmath1c film @xcite .",
    "the film was prepared by pulsed laser deposition on an mgo single crystal substrate .",
    "the sc transition temperature @xmath2 = 15.2k ( with transition width @xmath15 0.3k ) was determined from resistive measurements .",
    "the residual resistance ratio @xmath16 of the film was about 8 .",
    "x - ray data indicate that the film consists of small crystallites having their primary orientation with the _ c _ axis perpendicular to the substrate surface .",
    "the measurement cell was placed in a flow cryostat , enabling measurement at a series of temperatures up to @xmath2 and higher .",
    "point contacts were created by touching sharpened cu and ag wires to the film surface directly within the cryostat at liquid helium temperature .",
    "an unfortunate disadvantage of this needle  anvil method is the sensitivity of the contacts to mechanical vibrations and changes in temperature . as a result ,",
    "only around one quarter of the prepared contacts withstood measurement above liquid helium temperature    using a technique of synchronous detection of weak ( 10 - 30@xmath17v ) modulating signal harmonics , the first harmonic of the modulating signal @xmath18 [ proportional to the differential resistance @xmath19 was recorded as a function of the bias voltage @xmath20 .     of point contact yni@xmath1b@xmath1c",

    "a series of @xmath3 measurements with clear double minimum features near @xmath26 connected with the andreev reflection of electrons at the superconductor  normal metal ( s  n ) interface are shown in figs.[yf1](a ) and [ yf2](a ) .    for voltages exceeding the gap value , all curves",
    "exhibit maxima caused , most likely , by the suppression of superconductivity in ( part of ) the contact .",
    "such behavior testifies to a deviation from the spectral ( ballistic ) regime ( i.e. , the inelastic electron mean free path becomes less than or about the size of the contact ) with increasing bias voltage at the contact ( see @xcite , chapter 3 ) .     of point contact yni@xmath1b@xmath1c  cu with normal state resistance @xmath27 , measured at different temperatures .",

    "curves are offset vertically from the lower curve for clarity.,width=302 ]    the size of the gap was calculated using the modified btk theory ( see @xcite , chapter 3.7 ) .",
    "the presence of maxima in @xmath3 prevented the coincidence of the calculated and measured curves throughout the voltage range ; therefore an adjustment was carried out so that both curves coincided in the region of the gap ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and at the higher voltages beyond the maxima .",
    "preliminary , unadjusted curves were normalized to @xmath33 . during calculation , the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 were fixed or varied in small limits up to 510% .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[yf1](b ) and [ yf2](b ) .",
    "we note also that the contacts shown in figs.[yf1 ] and [ yf2 ] had , respectively , the minimal and maximal gap values among all the contacts that withstood low temperature measurement .    in fig.[yf3](a ) , the dependences @xmath9 are shown for a number of different contacts , for each of which a series of @xmath36 curves at different temperatures was measured .",
    "for all these contacts , the sc minimum in @xmath3 disappeared at a temperature interval of 1416k , corresponding to the @xmath10 value ( 15.2k ) of the film .    in fig.[yf3](b ) , the temperature dependences for the maximal and minimal @xmath37 k ) are shown , normalized to these values ( 2.24mev and 1.67mev , respectively ) . also the normalized @xmath9 temperature dependence obtained by averaging all five contacts of fig.[yf3](a ) , and the theoretical bcs dependence are depicted .",

    "it is seen that as the contact resistance is reduced , humps start to appear to a greater degree , and the intensity of the local maximum at zero bias increases .",
    "the latter is possible to explain , proceeding from @xcite where it is shown that in the diffusive regime @xmath3 looks like the presence of a barrier with @xmath34= 0.55 in the ballistic regime .",
    "in other words , for a clean s ",
    "n boundary without a barrier ( @xmath34 = 0 ) in the diffusive regime , it is possible to observe a maximum in @xmath3 at zero bias , similar to the ballistic case with @xmath49 . in reality , from fig.[yf6](c ) it is seen that the parameter @xmath34 grows with the reduction of contact resistance , coming nearer to the value 0.55 .",
    "it is necessary to note that the @xmath4 value for these contacts is practically independent of their resistance , remaining around 2.2 @xmath13 0.1mev . on the other hand",
    ", the parameter @xmath35 grows strongly with resistance , as observed experimentally for many superconductors of different sorts ( see fig.12.14 in @xcite ) , although the reason for this remains under discussion .",
    "the presented point contact measurements show a distribution of the sc gap in the electronic density of states of an yni@xmath1b@xmath1c film . important and essential",
    "is the fact that irrespective of the size of the gap , ranging from 1.5mev to 2.4mev , the observed critical temperature corresponds to the @xmath2 of the film .",
    "this excludes the possibility of a distribution of the gap on the film surface owing to its non - uniform structure .",
    "another possible source of a gap variation is the proximity effect resulting in gap suppression at the surface .",
    "however , we assume that in this case the gap value should correlate inversely with the point contact resistance , in other words with the size of the contact : the smaller the size , the lower the gap value measured . however , this is not the case .",
    "the gap value varies even for contacts with nearly equal resistance [ fig.[yf5](inset ) ] , and has a tendency , if any , to rise with increasing resistance [ fig.[yf6](b ) ] .",
    "hence , it is natural to first assume the presence of a gap anisotropy .",
    "unfortunately , the use of a film does not allow measurements to be made along different crystallographic directions .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , the film is predominantly _ c _ axis oriented , and consists of small crystallites .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect that with contacts prepared by touching a film plane with a needle , we will mainly register a gap along the _ c _ axis . yet , taking into account that the contribution to point contact conductivity result from some finite solid angle , the point contact axis is not well fixed along the _ c _ axis and with the possible misorientation of some crystallites our data can be interpreted as the observation of the gap anisotropy with @xmath7/@xmath50 1.6 .",
    "we also note that , as seen from fig.[yf4 ] , the ratio 2@xmath51 is close to the standard bcs value of 3.52 .    as to the presence of a hybrid gap with @xmath52 wave order parameter symmetry and point nodes in certain directions , we never observed gaps less than 1.5mev .",
    "the results of point contact measurements in @xcite , giving @xmath53 0.45mev along the _ a _ axis , give rise to some questions .",
    "firstly , the dependence @xmath9 for the @xmath54 directions looks at least atypical ; secondly , the critical temperature in this direction was found to be two times less than in the bulk ; and thirdly , even for the maximal gap , 2@xmath55 2.86 , much lower than the bcs value .",
    "this raises the doubt of whether to take into account that nickel borocarbides are more likely superconductors with strong coupling .",
    "we note that the single crystals investigated in @xcite had a significantly lower @xmath56 14.6k , in comparison with the value 15.5k usually quoted in the literature .",
    "thus , an insufficient sample quality is apparently responsible for the reported `` anisotropy '' of the sc order parameter in @xcite .",
    "considering the role of disorder in anisotropic superconductors , nonmagnetic impurity scattering has profound effects on hybrid @xmath52 wave superconductors with point nodes .",
    "it is mentioned in @xcite that a disorder - induced quasiparticle energy gap opens up even for infinitesimal scattering rates .",
    "this may be a reason why we did not observe any nodal features in the sc gap .",
    "however , impurity scattering also decreases the critical temperature , which is not observed in our investigations .",
    "thus , according to @xcite , a disorder - induced energy gap of about 10k @xmath57 1mev corresponds to a @xmath2 reduction to 13k .",
    "concerning the effect of the pressure produced by point - contact formation on the gap distribution , we expect that under such a pressure the critical temperature should also vary in the same way as the gap .",
    "however , no such variation is observed , suggesting that there is no measurable effect due to pressure in this experiment .",

    "open squares show the magnetic field behavior of @xmath4 for another contact with small gap value .",
    "the dotted curve shows the behavior @xmath59 of the pair potential of a type ii superconductor in the vortex state according to abrikosov s theory .",
    "dashed lines connect circles and open squares as guides to the eye .",
    "inset : reduced experimental @xmath60 in zero field and in magnetic fields of 1 t and 5 t .",
    "( b ) behavior of the excess current in a magnetic field .",
    "the inset shows symmetrized experimental and theoretical @xmath61 in zero field .",
    "the excess current was determined as the integral of the calculated @xmath61 after subtraction of the normal state conductivity ( horizontal dashed line ) .",
    "error bars were determined as the integral of the difference between theoretical and experimental @xmath61 curves .",
    "the greatest difference arises due to the presence of minima in the experimental @xmath61 curves at biases exceeding the gap energy .",
    ", width=302 ]    let s consider the question of the realization of multiband superconductivity in _",
    "r_ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( _ r _ = y , lu ) , considered in @xcite .",
    "we can not distinguish whether the observed gap distribution is a consequence of anisotropy or a multiband electronic structure . in this connection",
    ", we note that the authors of ref.@xcite , investigating point contact spectra of a luni@xmath1b@xmath1c single crystal , found that the calculated theoretical curves better describe the experimental data when a two - gap adjustment is used , although in the @xmath60 curves , only one gap minimum is visible . in so doing ,",
    "the relation between the maximal and minimal gap was found to be around 1.75 in the _ c _ direction and 1.5 in the @xmath62 plane .",
    "this is close to the value found by us , @xmath63 1.6 . to this",
    "it is possible to add that our preliminary data after analysis of about 60 @xmath3 spectra measured on a cleaved yni@xmath64b@xmath64c single crystal also show a gap distribution . in this case for 80% of the contacts the gap is distributed in the same range from 1.5mev to 2.4mev , while for 20% of the contacts the gap ranged more from 2.5mev to 3.0mev , and one can discern maxima in the entire gap distribution at 2.0mev and 2.4mev .",
    "interestingly , to fit the experimental @xmath65 curve for the _ c _ direction in luni@xmath64b@xmath64c in ref.@xcite ( fig.13 ) , the authors used a gap distribution with two peaks also around 2.0mev and 2.5mev .",
    "a prominent feature of a multiband superconductor is also the specific behavior of the excess current in the point contacts . in @xcite",
    "it was revealed that in the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath1 , the excess current has a strongly pronounced positive curvature in a magnetic field . in fig.[yf7 ] , the behavior of the sc gap and the excess current in a magnetic field for one of the yni@xmath1b@xmath1c contacts is shown .",
    "it can be seen that , while the behavior of the gap is similar to that of the pair potential of a type ii superconductor in the vortex state and has negative curvature [ fig.[yf7](a ) , closed squares and dotted curve ] , the excess current has a strong positive curvature [ fig.[yf7](b ) ] .",
    "a similar behavior of the gap and the excess current in a magnetic field was observed by us for several of the investigated contacts ( @xmath3 have been processed for four contacts ) .",
    "another consideration is that a small gap has an almost linear decrease under a magnetic field [ fig.[yf7](a ) , open squares ] .",
    "this is similar to the theoretical behavior of the small gap in mgb@xmath1 calculated in @xcite .",
    "thus , our observation of the excess current and small gap behavior under a magnetic field may be taken in support of a multiband sc state in yni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "studies of the sc gap @xmath4 and its temperature dependence @xmath9 in yni@xmath1b@xmath1c have shown a distribution of @xmath4 values from @xmath5 1.5mev up to @xmath66 2.4mev , however in all cases with a bcs - like @xmath9 dependence . the observed 2@xmath67 3.66 is also close to the bcs value of 3.52 , and the critical temperature in all cases corresponded to that of the film , thus excluding the possibility that the observations result from heterogeneity in the properties of the film .",
    "it is most probable that the distribution of the gap can be attributed to gap anisotropy , or to the multiband nature of the sc state in yni@xmath64b@xmath64c .",
    "the positive curvature in the behavior of the excess current under applied magnetic field ( fig.[yf7](b ) ) tends to support the multiband scenario .",
    "proceeding from the stated results , and also preliminary investigations of yni@xmath64b@xmath64c single crystals , the presence of point nodes in the sc order parameter of yni@xmath64b@xmath64c is considered to be unlikely .",
    "the analogous conclusion is reached also in a recent work @xcite on the basis of the observation of a sudden disappearance of de haas ",
    "van alphen oscillations at the transition to the mixed state .",
    "finally , in a recent preprint @xcite , the authors of ref.@xcite have modified their earlier claims and come to the conclusion from the analysis of the field variation of their @xmath65 spectra that the unconventional gap function observed in yni@xmath64b@xmath64c could originate from multiband superconductivity .",
