    "type  ii supernovae ( sne  ii ) have historically been divided into the type  iil ( linear ) and type  iip ( plateau ) subclasses based on the shape of their light curves in the weeks following explosion @xcite .",
    "sne  iip light curves have a clear plateau phase , where the sn brightness stays nearly constant ( in the optical ) for roughly 100 days .",
    "the plateau phase is mainly powered by a moving hydrogen recombination front that travels through the hydrogen - rich material that is ejected and ionized during the explosion @xcite .",
    "a prototypical example of a type iip sn is sn  1999em @xcite .",
    "sne  iil exhibit a linear decay that starts soon after peak brightness , they are more rare than sne iip and , because light curves of type iil sne decline faster than light curves of type iip sne , only a handful of sne iil have been followed for more that three months after peak brightness .",
    "prototypical example of type iil sne are sn  1979c and sn  1980k ( see * ? ? ?",
    "sne  iil are on average more luminous than sne  iip by @xmath01.5 mag @xcite .",
    "spectroscopically , sne  iil have on average redder continua and have higher oxygen to hydrogen ratio as compared to ordinary sne  iip @xcite .",
    "sne  iil also exhibit higher expansion velocities at early times @xcite , and less pronounced p - cygni profiles @xcite .",
    "given these differences , there is a general consensus that the progenitor stars of sne  iil have a relatively small amount of hydrogen in their envelopes , while sne  iip more likely originate from hydrogen - rich stars .",
    "it is not currently known whether the progenitors of sne  iil gradually lose their hydrogen layer , creating a continuous class extending from sne  iil to sn  iip , or if there is a specific mechanism that creates distinct classifications as has been previously suggested @xcite .",
    "this traditional classification scheme has been supported in recent compilations of sn  ii light curves by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the historical distinction between the two classes could be due to the small number of well observed sne  iil .",
    "they have also suggested that the historical distinction between iip and iil , based on the presence of a plateau or a linear decay in the light curve , is insufficient for a complete mapping of sn  ii diversity .",
    "@xcite suggested that if all sne  iil are followed for a long enough time , they will exhibit , after the linear decay , a significant drop in their light curves .",
    "this would provide further evidence that iip s and iil s share the same underlying physics .",

    "four epochs of visual - wavelength spectra of sn  2013by were obtained with wifes @xcite on the anu 2.3 m telescope , and three epochs of nir spectra with fire @xcite on the magellan 6.5 m baade telescope ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
