    "over the past decade , experimental force spectroscopy techniques such as atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and optical or magnetic tweezers emerged as novel methods which allow the manipulation of individual polymers with spatial resolution in the _ nm _ range and force resolution in the _ pn _ range@xcite .",

    "an important result concerning the properties of adsorbed macromolecule under pulling turns to be the observation @xcite that the universal exponents ( which govern polymer loops statistics ) undergo renormalization when excluded volume effects between chain segments are taken into account . in this work",
    "we use similar methods to describe the structure and detachment of a polymer chain from a sticky substrate under pulling and demonstrate the unusual properties of this phase transformation in two conjugated statistical ensembles .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that a full description of the force - induced desorption of a self - avoiding polymer chain can be achieved by means of the gce approach , yielding the average size and probability distribution functions of all basic structural units of partially adsorbed polymer as well as their variation with changing force or strength of adhesion .",

    "the polymer detachment transition under pulling is found to be of first order whereby due to its dichotomic nature phase coexistence is impossible .",

    "reentrant  in absolute units of force against temperature .",
    "thus , at very low temperature the polymer is expected to be desorbed , with the growing @xmath156 it may adsorb , and at even higher temperature - desorb again from the surface .",
    "one finds that the crossover exponent , @xmath7 , governing polymer adsorption at criticality , whose exact value has been controversial for a long time , depends essentially on interactions between different loops so that @xmath7 may only vary within the limits @xmath8 .",
    "a point of more general importance for the statistical mechanics in general and theory of phase transitions in particular is the issue of ensemble equivalence .",
    "the latter implies an identity of the equation of state , regardless of which statistical ensemble has been employed , whereas the fluctuations within the different ensembles may be entirely different@xcite . for finite polymer lengths , however , differences in the equation of state may also be visible .",
