    "the ability to carry a dissipationless electric current is a fundamental attribute of a superconductor .",
    "one might naively expect that this property is preserved at reduced dimensions .",
    "unfortunately , inevitable fluctuations result in momentary suppression of superconductivity leading to energy dissipation .",
    "being integrated in time , this effect manifests itself as finite resistance .",
    "of particular interest are quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) systems , with effective diameter @xmath2 smaller than the superconducting coherence length @xmath3 , where there is only one parallel channel of supercurrent . in such objects , due to fluctuations of the order parameter ,",
    "the effective resistance is never strictly equal to zero .",
    "however , a measurable resistance at temperatures well below the critical temperature @xmath4 can be observed only in samples with rather small diameters .",
    "early experiments @xcite confirmed that in narrow superconducting channels the shape of the @xmath0 transition can be explained by thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recent experimental @xcite - @xcite and theoretical @xcite - @xcite discoveries claim the existence of an additional ( non thermal ) mechanism of finite resistance in 1d systems .",
    "the issue is of vital importance for the development of superconducting nanoelectronic elements designed to carry a dissipationless electric current .",
    "the finite resistance of a 1d channel can be understood that for sufficiently longs system of length @xmath5 there is always the finite probability of a fluctuation to drive instantly a fraction of the wire of volume @xmath6 into a normal state .",
    "the energy required for this process is the corresponding superconducting condensation energy @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the critical magnetic field .",
    "if thermal effects solely contribute to the fluctuations , it has been shown @xcite that the effective dc voltage @xmath9 is proportional to the probability of these events @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzman constant : @xmath12 \\sinh \\left ( \\frac{i}{% 2i_{0}}\\right ) , \\]]@xmath13 is the temperature - dependent critical current , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "the current dependence is determined by the @xmath16 term and the term under the exponent , responsible for the effective reduction of the potential barrier @xmath17 by the finite current @xmath18 .",
    "an exact form of the pre - factor @xmath19 has been proposed @xcite .",
    "though the function @xmath20 also contains temperature- and current - dependent terms , it contributes negligibly compared to the strong exponential dependence .",
    "formally the above process can be described as the thermally activated transition of a superconducting system from a local potential minimum to a neighboring one separated by @xmath21 in phase space : so called , thermally activated phase slip ( taps ) .",
    "one can make a formal analogy with a `` classical jump '' of a particle over the barrier @xmath22 stimulated by the thermal energy @xmath23 .",
    "an alternative mechanism has been proposed associated with tunneling through the energy barrier @xmath22 in phase space @xcite .",
    "such tunneling to a state of lower energy , also called _ quantum phase slip _ ( qps ) , should provide an additional ( to taps ) channel of energy dissipation in a current carrying system . for conventional type - i superconductors estimations show that measurable deviations from the taps mechanism are expected in samples with effective diameter @xmath24 10 nm . there have been a few experiments , claiming observation of qps phenomenon in various superconducting materials : in , pb and pb - in @xcite , pb , sn and pb - bi @xcite , moge @xcite , sn and zn @xcite , al zgirski nanolett , @xcite .",
    "various models consider non - thermal mechanisms of the finite resisitivity of a 1d superconductor @xcite - pesin . in spite of the intensive research in the field ,",
    "the matter is far from being settled . from an experimental point of view , to some extent , the inhomogeneity of a nanowire might lead to a broad superconducting transition @xmath0 which can be erroneously associated with the qps mechanism zgirski prb limitation .",
    "another source of misinterpretation might come from insufficient filtering from environmental rf noise .",
    "the resulting parasitic overheating can shift the superconducting transition to lower temperatures , distorting the shape of the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "our motivation was to perform experiments eliminating the uncertainty related to the uniqueness of each particular nanostructure .",
    "we were able to trace the crossover from the taps mechanism to qps in the _ same sample  _ , successively reducing its diameter between measurements , thereby evidencing for a solely size dependent origin of the phenomenon .",
    "the experiments performed on multiple sets of aluminum nanowires reduced by ion sputtering down to sub-10 nm scales showed quantitatively similar behavior . in all structures with effective diameter @xmath25 15 nm the @xmath0 dependences deviate from the predictions of the taps model langer , while the qps scenario @xcite provides a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "in our earlier work @xcite we demonstrated that low energy @xmath26 ion sputtering progressively and non - destructively reduces nanostructure dimensions .",
    "the penetration depth of @xmath26 ions into an @xmath27 matrix at acceleration voltages of @xmath28 500 ev is about 1.5 nm and is comparable to the thickness of naturally formed oxide .",
    "the accuracy of the effective diameter @xmath2 determination from the normal state resistance , scanning electron microscope ( sem ) and scanning probe microscope ( spm ) measurements is about @xmath29 2 nm .",
    "only those samples which showed no obvious geometrical imperfections were used for further experiments . while reducing the nanowire diameter ,",
    "the low energy ion sputtering also provides `` polishing '' removing surface roughness inevitable after a lift - off process @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in this work",
    "the method @xcite , @xcite was applied to lithographically fabricated 99.999 % pure @xmath27 nanowires with initial cross - section of about 100 nm x 100 nm . during measurements the structures were immersed into a directly pumped @xmath30 bath with base temperature of about 0.95 k. contrary to refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we used a four - probe configuration , eliminating necessity to consider the contribution of the electrodes .",
    "we obtained exact quantitative agreement between data measured with dc and ac currents using extensive multistage rf filtering .",
    "the results are reproducible and do not suffer from hardware - related artifacts .",
    "after a sequence of sputterings [ alternated with @xmath0 measurements ] the wire cross section @xmath31 is reduced down to @xmath32 20 nm , where deviations from taps behavior become obvious ( fig .",
    "similar results were obtained on several sets of aluminum nanowires with length @xmath33 equal to 1 @xmath34 , 5 @xmath34 and 10 @xmath34 . for larger diameters ( e.g. , fig .",
    "3 , insert , 55 nm wire ) the shape of the r(t ) dependence can be qualitatively described by the taps mechanism .",
    "notice that a size dependent variation of the critical temperature of a nanowire @xcite , especially pronounced in aluminum @xcite , results in a broadening of the @xmath0 transition and significantly reduces straightforward applicability of the taps model @xcite .",
    "confidence in assigning our results to the manifestation of a new ( non - thermal ) mechanism comes from the experimental observation that in aluminum nanowires ( films ) the critical temperature increases with a decrease of the wire diameter ( film thickness ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it means that the broadening of the @xmath0 dependencies below the bulk @xmath35 value @xmath28 1.2 k can not be explained by a geometrical imperfection ( e.g. , constriction ) of an aluminium nanowire . below a certain limit @xmath36 20",

    "where possible , we tried to compare our data with the models and found the best agreement with renormalization theory zaikin .",
    "the full version of the model for systems of an arbitrary length @xmath43 is rather sophisticated , requiring knowledge of parameters not easily deductible from experiment .",
    "however , if the wire is short enough that only one phase slip event can happen at a time , one can neglect the effects of the interaction between the phase slips . in this limit",
    "the simplified expression for the rate of qps activation is    @xmath44    where the action @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being a numerical constant , @xmath47 6.47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the characteristic response time of a superconducting system which roughly determines the duration of each qps @xcite .",
    "the effective ( time averaged ) voltage @xmath50 due to the fluctuations can be found using the josephson relation @xcite .",
    "finally , for the effective resistance of a quasi-1d superconducting nanowire one gets    @xmath51    contrary to taps @xcite , the qps contribution has a rather weak temperature dependence far from the critical temperature and should produce a finite resistance even at @xmath52 for sufficiently narrow wires @xcite .",
    "one can achieve reasonable agreement between the model [ eqs . 2 and 3 ] and the experiment ( fig .",
    "2 ) . there are four fitting parameters : critical temperature @xmath35 , normal state resistance @xmath53 , mean free path @xmath54 [ to re - calculate the dirty limit coherence length @xmath55 ] , and the numerical parameter @xmath46 of the order of unit @xcite . the critical temperature and the normal state resistance can be trivially deduced from experimental @xmath0 dependences .",
    "roughly the mean free path @xmath54 can be estimated from the normal state resistivity @xmath56 , as the product @xmath57 is a well - tabulated value for dirty - limit aluminum . in our ultra - narrow nanowires",
    "the cross - section is known from spm measurements with @xmath29 2 nm accuracy .",
    "hence , there is some freedom in the selection of the mean free path . as a rule of thumb for all our nanowires with effective diameter",
    "@xmath58 20 nm the best - fitted mean free path ( at low temperatures ) was found to be roughly equal to one - half of the diameter ( fig .",
    "2 , caption ) .",
    "the observation is quite reasonable , taking into consideration that at these scales and temperatures electron scattering is mainly determined by the sample s physical boundaries . for",
    "all aluminum nanowires the best - fitted value for the parameter @xmath46 was found to be equal to 0.15 . as the value of @xmath46 can not be calculated within the model @xcite with the required accuracy , we believe that the correspondence between the simplified `` short wire '' model and the experiment can be considered as good .    no coulomb blockade has been observed on @xmath59 characteristics , indicating good homogeneity of the wires ( absence of tunnel barriers ) . below the critical temperature",
    "@xmath59 dependences show @xmath60 behavior similar to both taps [ eq . 1 [ ] and renormalization @xcite models . at sufficiently small currents",
    "@xmath61 20 na one might expect a linear response , while at much higher currents trivial overheating is observed .",
    "however , there exist an intermediate regime between linear and strongly non - linear regimes : the top part of the @xmath0 transition is not shifted , while the slope of the bottom part decreases with an increase of the measuring current ( fig .",
    "we associate this peculiarity with the reduction of the potential barrier @xmath22 by a finite current @xmath18 [ eq . 1 ] , which is qualitatively similar for thermal @xcite and quantum @xcite mechanisms .",

    "the dimensionless conductance @xmath67 is related to the effective `` quasiparticle '' resistance @xmath68 , being associated with dissipation provided by the quasiparticle channel .",
    "@xmath68 can be considered as a fitting parameter and should be of the order of the normal state resitance @xmath53 . in the metallic phase ,",

    "for each sample , the deviation of the fitting parameter @xmath68 from @xmath53 is less pronounced for @xmath59 characteristics . probably , this discrepancy is the result of the experimental difficulty to satisfy the applicability condition @xmath70 , while the temperature should be noticeably below the critical temperature @xmath35 , where the whole concept of phase slippage is valid .    .",

    "nmr is observed only in the thinest samples @xmath36 20 nm and only at temperatures well below the onset of superconductivity .",
    "a similar effect has been reported for ultrathin 1d lead strips @xcite .",
    "aluminum is known to be immune to the creation of localized magnetic moments provided by the majority of magnetic elements .",
    "our samples were e - beam evaporated from 99.999 % pure aluminum target in an uhv chamber where magnetic materials have never been processed .",
    "hence , the residual concentration of magnetic ions should be negligible .",
    "even if we were to assume their presence , magnetic fields where nmr is observed are too small to polarize them .",
    "additionally , we do not see an enhancement of @xmath35 related to the onset of superconductivity , which would be the consequence of suppression of the kondo mechanism by a magnetic field . as the presence of localized magnetic moments in our samples is not obvious , a recently developed model of nmr ref .",
    "@xcite is not applicable .",
    "nmr has been predicted in disordered superconducting wires @xcite .",
    "however , the main result of that model is an exponentially small addition to the taps effective resistance .",
    "this conclusion contradicts our main observation ( fig .",
    "2 ) and , hence , the applicability of the whole model @xcite to our experiments is questionable . for the moment",
    "we do not have a solid explanation for the nmr effect .",
    "the phenomenon might be related to an interplay between two field - dependent contributions : @xmath22 barrier reduction and suppression of the superconducting energy gap @xmath72 .",
    "the first process provides an expected increase of the observed resistance , while the second one leads to a reduced quasiparticle resistance @xmath68 due to thermal activation of extra quasiparticles resulting in lower effective resistance @xmath0 .",
    "there might be a region of magnetic fields where the second mechanism `` wins '' reducing the influence of quantum fluctuations leading to nmr @xcite .",
    "another explanation of the nmr might be related to the formation of a charge imbalance region accompanying each phase slip event @xcite .",
    "this non - equilibrium region provides dissipation outside the core of a phase slip .",
    "the corresponding ohmic contribution can be effectively suppressed by the magnetic field , resulting in nmr .",
    "however , so far the validity of the charge imbalance concept was only demonstrated at temperatures sufficiently close to @xmath73 and its applicability to qps at temperatures well below the critical one is not obvious .",

    "inset : resistance vs perpendicular magnetic field for the same sample measured at constant temperature and small ac current.,scaledwidth=110.0% ]",
    "the homogeneity of the wires is the central point in an interpretation of data related to phase slip mechanisms : thermal or quantum .",
    "the existence of trivial structural or geometrical imperfections as constrictions , boundaries and contact regions might broaden the @xmath0 dependences @xcite and can be erroneously interpreted as a `` new physic''. the specially developed method of ion beam sputtering @xcite , @xcite to a large extent allowed us to study the evolution of the size phenomenon , eliminating artifacts related to the uniqueness of samples fabricated in independent processing runs .",
    "the ion beam treatment polishes the surface of the samples , removing the inevitable roughness just after fabrication ( fig .",
    "if there were no detectable geometrical imperfections in the original ( thick ) wires , they can not be introduced while reducing the diameter by the low energy ion sputtering .",
    "formally , it can not be excluded that in the original structures there were `` hidden '' undetectable structural defects ( e.g. , highly resistive grain boundaries ) which did not contribute to conductivity , being shunted by the bulk . when the diameter of the wire is reduced below a certain scale",
    ", this type of imperfections might determine the behavior of the quasi-1d system .",
    "however , the absence of coulomb blockade and/or gap structure on @xmath75 characteristics rules out the presence of the highly resistive tunnel barriers .    the extensive spm and sem analysis indicates that after several sessions of ion beam sputtering the surface of our nanowire is flat with few nm accuracy .",
    "this is quite small in absolute terms , particularly keeping in mind that the lattice constant in aluminum is @xmath76 0.4 nm . however , approaching the 10 nm scale , a few nm roughness means a lot in relative terms .",
    "hence , we can not exclude the possibility that the specified average effective diameter of our nanowires is not very representative : the phase slippage might happen in the weakest ( thinnest ? ) parts . to eliminate completely this uncertainty one should study infinitely long atomically flat structures , which are quite problematic to fabricate",
    "nevertheless , the main conclusion of the present paper is still valid even assuming the presence of inevitable imperfection of the samples . at all realistic parameters characterizing the geometry of the possible constrictions",

    ", we have traced the evolution of the shape of the superconducting transition @xmath0 in quasi - one - dimensional aluminum nanowires with progressive reduction of their cross - sections .",
    "for relatively thick samples @xmath77 20 nm the shape of the transitions can be qualitatively explained in terms of wire inhomogeneity and the model of thermally activated phase slips ( taps ) . while in nanowires with effective diameter @xmath32 15 nm",
    "the @xmath0 dependences are much wider and no reasonable set of fitting parameters can account for the taps mechanism . the phenomenon is associated with manifestation of quantum fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "the results are in good agreement with renormalization theory @xcite .",
    "the effect of quantum fluctuations should have a universal validity , indicating a breakdown of the zero resistance state in quasi - one - dimensional superconductors , setting fundamental limitations on miniaturization of nanoelectronic components designed to carry a dissipationless supercurrent .",
