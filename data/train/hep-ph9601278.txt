    "the inclusive production of single hadrons in fixed - target and colliding - beam experiments has been one of the most important testing grounds for the qcd - improved parton model .",
    "in contrast to the collective observation of jets of hadrons , the detection of single mesons and baryons also allows one to study fragmentation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mechanism of how partons ( quarks , gluons , and photons ) turn into hadronic matter . in the framework of the qcd - improved parton model ,",
    "the cross section of inclusive single - hadron production is described as a convolution of the parton - parton scattering cross sections with the parton density functions ( pdf s ) of the initial - state particles and the fragmentation functions ( ff s ) , which characterize the transition of the partons that come out of the hard scattering to the hadrons that finally hit the detector .",
    "the factorization theorem @xcite ensures that the pdf s and ff s are universal and that only the partonic cross sections change when different processes are considered .",
    "while the partonic cross sections may be perturbatively calculated from the qcd lagrangian , this is not yet possible for the pdf s and the ff s of hadrons with masses smaller than or comparable to the asymptotic scale parameter , @xmath7 , and one has to determine them by fitting experimental data .",
    "the pdf s of protons and photons , which are needed to describe , _ e.g. _ , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath1 reactions , are already highly constrained by measurements of deep - inelastic @xmath9 and @xmath10 processes .",
    "the most direct way to obtain information on the ff s of hadrons is to analyze their energy spectrum measured in @xmath0 annihilation , where the theoretical predictions are not obscured by additional nonperturbative input , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the form of pdf s for the incoming particles .",
    "after the extraction of leading - order ( lo ) ff s for pions and kaons from low - energy data of @xmath0 annihilation and muon - nucleon deep - inelastic scattering in the late 70 s and early 80 s @xcite , there had long been no progress in this field .",
    "some time ago , new next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) ff sets for charged and neutral pions and kaons as well as for eta mesons were fitted to @xmath0 data generated with well - established monte carlo ( mc ) programs , which are fine - tuned so as to describe well a broad selection of experimental data @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to directly fit to experimental data .",
    "we took this avenue for charged pions and kaons @xcite and neutral kaons @xcite by analyzing slac - pep and recent cern - lep1 data .",
    "the assumption that the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) quarks fragment into charged pions ( kaons ) in the same way , which we had to make in ref .",
    "@xcite , could be discarded in ref .",
    "@xcite , thanks to the advent of accurate data from the aleph collaboration at lep1 @xcite , in which the fragmentation of gluons , @xmath13 quarks , and light flavours into charged hadrons was distinguished . in the meantime , these data have become available in published form @xcite , where the fragmentation of quarks into charged hadrons is also reported for an enriched @xmath12-quark sample .",
    "this latter information was not at our disposal at the time of our analysis @xcite .",
    "however , we verified that our @xmath12-quark ff s for charged hadrons are approximately in agreement with this new measurement . in order to probe the scaling violation predicted by the altarelli - parisi equations @xcite , we made comparisons with other @xmath0 data collected at different centre - of - mass ( cm ) energies . to test the validity of the factorization theorem for fragmentation , we also confronted measurements of inclusive single - hadron production by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite at the desy @xmath9 collider hera and by ua1 @xcite at the cern @xmath15 collider with the corresponding theoretical predictions based on our ff s @xcite . in all cases , we found good agreement .",
    "existing data on inclusive single - hadron production in collisions of quasireal photons offer yet another opportunity to quantitatively check the factorization theorem , which we wish to seize in the following .",
    "the purpose of this work is to use our new ff s for charged pions and kaons @xcite to make predictions for inclusive single - charged - particle production in @xmath1 collisions , which can soon be confronted with first experimental data from lep2 . with the exception of inclusive @xmath16 production @xcite",
    ", there exist no nlo predictions for inclusive particle production at lep2 in the literature .",
    "we also consider @xmath1 physics at a next - generation @xmath0 linear collider ( nlc ) with cm energy @xmath5  gev .",
    "furthermore , we compare our nlo analysis with @xmath1 data at low cm energies measured some time ago with the tasso detector at desy petra @xcite and with the mark  ii detector at slac pep @xcite . these data are at rather low @xmath6 , where our nlo formalism is not expected to yield reliable results , so that a meaningful test of our ff s may not be possible .",
    "as is well known , three mechanisms contribute to the production of quarks and gluons in @xmath1 collisions : @xmath17 in the production through direct photons ( dd ) , the two photons directly couple to the quark lines in the hard - scattering amplitudes . at least to lo ,",
    "no spectator particles travel along the photon axes .",
    "@xmath18 if one of the photons splits into a flux of quarks ( and gluons ) , one of these quarks may directly interact with the second photon .",
    "the remaining quarks ( and gluons ) build up a spectator jet in the direction of the split photon ( single - resolved ( dr ) @xmath19 contribution ) .",
    "the @xmath1 cross section of this mechanism depends on the pdf s of the photon .",
    "@xmath20 if both photons split into quarks and gluons ( double - resolved ( rr ) @xmath19 contribution ) , two spectator jets appear .",
    "since the pdf s of the photon take large values  at small @xmath21 through the gluon part and at large @xmath21 through the so - called point - like quark part  the dr and rr contributions are numerically of the same order as the dd one .",
    "we perform a consistent nlo analysis , _",
    "i.e. _ , we include the dd , dr , and rr hard - scattering cross sections , the photon pdf s , and the ff s at nlo .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section  2",
    ", we shortly describe the formalism which we use to calculate the dd , dr , and rr contributions up to nlo .",
    "section  3 contains our numerical results for petra , pep , lep2 , and nlc energies . here",
    ", we also compare with the tasso and mark  ii data .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  4 .",
    "when we speak of @xmath1 collisions with almost real photons , we have in mind the @xmath0-collision process where the positrons and electrons act as sources of nearly massless , collinear photons , which collide with each other to produce a debris of hadrons in the final state . the energy spectrum for the produced photons",
    "is well described by the equivalent - photon approximation ( epa ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the longitudinal- and transverse - momentum components decouple .",
    "the transverse momentum is integrated out with certain constraints , specified by the experimental situation .",
    "the resulting spectra for the photons emitted from the positrons and electrons are thus functions of the longitudinal - momentum fractions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "these distributions depend on the experimental setup . in our analysis , we consider past and future experiments at the colliders petra , pep , lep2 , and nlc ( tesla design or laser spectrum ) . the respective forms of the epa will be specified later when we present our numerical results .",
    "our notation is as follows .",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the observed hadron and x includes all unobserved hadrons .",
    "the four - momentum assignments are indicated in the parentheses . in the epa ,",
    "the inclusive cross section of process  ( [ process ] ) is related to that of the corresponding @xmath1 reaction , @xmath26 through @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the photon - spectrum functions to be specified later on .",
    "the lower bounds of integration , @xmath31 , are fixed by kinematics in terms of the transverse momentum @xmath6 and cm rapidity @xmath32 of @xmath25 . in the applications to follow , the actual @xmath2 and @xmath3 acceptances",

    "the factorization scales , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , will be specified later on . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ xgg ] ) is the direct - photon contribution ( dd ) , the second and third ones are the once - resolved contributions ( dr ) , and the fourth one is the twice - resolved contribution ( rr ) . in lo ,",
    "the dd contribution is of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is of the same order as the the respective hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "the lo hard - scattering cross sections in the dr and rr components are of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , so that , at first sight , the lo dr and rr contributions might be considered to be of higher orders in the strong coupling constant , @xmath48 .",
    "however , they are formally and numerically of the same order as the lo direct part , since the quark pdf s of the photon are enhanced by the factor @xmath49 and the gluon pdf is enhanced at small @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the factor @xmath49 from the photon pdf s properly adjusts the orders of the dr and rr contributions .",
    "it is convenient to define pdf s for finding a particular parton @xmath40 , with momentum fraction @xmath21 , inside the positron or electron , @xmath50 . in the epa , this function is given by the convolution of the respective photon pdf , @xmath51 , with the photon - spectrum function , @xmath52 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) , viz . @xmath53",

    "the functions @xmath67 contain the nlo corrections to the hard - scattering cross sections , and @xmath68 is the qcd renormalization scale .",
    "the @xmath69 functions for the dd channel have been derived by aurenche _",

    "direct and resolved photoproduction in @xmath9 scattering correspond to the dr and rr components in @xmath1 scattering , and we may convert our previous analysis by replacing the proton pdf s with the photon pdf s . for the evaluation of the dd contribution , we employ a computer code created by gordon in connection with ref .",
    "@xcite .    for consistency",
    ", one needs both the photon pdf s and ff s in nlo .",

    "i.e. _ , the sum of charged pions and kaons , we employ our recently constructed nlo set @xcite , which has been extracted in the @xmath75 factorization scheme .",
    "this scheme has also been employed for the derivation of the nlo kernels @xmath69 .    in the calculation of the @xmath69 functions pertinent to the dd and dr channels ,",
    "one encounters collinear singularities associated with the splitting of the incoming photons into @xmath76 pairs .",
    "these initial - state singularities are absorbed into the bare pdf s appearing in the resolved - photon contributions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the dr and rr components , which renders these functions @xmath77 dependent . a similar @xmath77 dependence , but with opposite sign , shows up in the @xmath69 functions of the dd and dr processes . in this way , the dd , dr , and rr processes become interrelated .",
    "the dr ( rr ) part is actually a nlo contribution to the dd ( dr ) part that can not be treated fully perturbatively anymore .",
    "this nonperturbative part is then described by the photon pdf s . up to higher - order terms in the photon pdf s",
    ", the @xmath77 dependence cancels in the combination of the dd and dr contributions on one hand , and the dr and rr contributions on the other hand .",
    "it is clear that the classification into dd , dr , and rr contributions becomes ambiguous if nlo corrections are included .",
    "nlo terms that have been attributed to the dd ( dr ) contribution may be shifted to the dr ( rr ) part .",
    "the cancellation of the dependences on @xmath77 and the choice of factorization scheme associated with the incoming - photon leg in the superposition of direct and resolved photoproduction in @xmath9 scattering has been demonstrated in ref .  @xcite . we expect that this cancellation also works for the @xmath1 process  ( [ not1 ] ) .",
    "the formal aspects of such cancellations in @xmath1 reactions have been investigated by gordon @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to present our numerical results for the cross section of inclusive charged - particle production in @xmath1 collisions at nlo .",

    "if this method works , it will be possible to generate high - luminosity beams of real photons carrying approximately 80% of the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the impact of various nlc collider options ) .",
    "we work in the @xmath75 renormalization and factorization scheme with @xmath78 active quark flavours and @xmath79  131  mev , except for our tasso and mark  ii analyses , where we use @xmath80 and @xmath81  200  mev .",
    "we identify the various scales and set @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a dimensionless scale factor . unless stated otherwise , we put @xmath84 and employ the nlo set of the grv photon pdf s @xcite in the @xmath75 scheme .",
    "we take the nlo ff s for charged pions and kaons from our recent work @xcite .",
    "we sum over charged charged pions and kaons .",
    "charged - baryon production is likely to be negligible ; in @xmath0 annihilation , some 10% of the charged tracks are due to protons and antiprotons @xcite , and one expects their fraction to be even smaller in @xmath1 processes . in our mark",

    ", we wish to investigate how well the qcd - improved parton model can explain existing data at lower energies . unfortunately , there are only few data for the inclusive cross section with information on the absolute normalization .",

    "a further experimental constraint in the tasso experiment was @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the angle of charged tracks with respect to the beam axis @xcite . this restricts the @xmath32 range over which we integrate the doubly differential cross section @xmath101 to be @xmath102 .",

    ", the measurement greatly exceeds our prediction , even for @xmath104 . at small @xmath6",
    ", we do expect that the data overshoot our theoretical result , since in this region soft interactions give rise to additional particle production , which has not been subtracted from the data .",
    "this contribution is supposed to be significant for @xmath105  gev and is usually described as in hadronic reactions induced by the vector - dominance - mechanism ( vdm ) component of the photon .",
    "we have no explanation for the disagreement with the data in the upper @xmath6 range .",
    "a serious background for the production of high-@xmath6 events from one - photon annihilation events , where either of the incoming positron or electron radiates a hard photon , was thoroughly investigated by tasso @xcite and was subtracted from the data shown in fig .",
    "it is interesting to study the relative importance of the dd , dr , and rr contributions . at @xmath106  gev , the rr component is dominant , whereas for larger @xmath6 the bulk of the cross section comes from the dd channel . at @xmath107 , 3 , 4 )",
    "gev , the dd component amounts to ( 51 , 69 , 75)% , respectively .",
    "this shows that , at these @xmath6 values , the use of different photon pdf s would not change the cross section in any appreciable way and that the disagreement with the data is due to the dd component .",

    "the virtualities of the photons emitted from the tagged lepton were required to lie between @xmath109  gev@xmath74 and @xmath110  gev@xmath74 and had the average value @xmath111  gev@xmath74 @xcite .",

    "we choose @xmath138 , so that @xmath139 . if the experimental setup was arranged so that @xmath140 , @xmath0 pairs would be produced in the collisions of the primary laser photons and the high - energetic backscattered photons . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we present the dd , dr , and rr contributions to the @xmath6 spectrum @xmath119 together with their sum . compared to the previous cases , the relative magnitudes of the dd , dr , and rr components have completely changed . at small @xmath6 , at about 5  gev",
    "say , the rr component is by far the largest , whereas the dd component is negligible . at large @xmath6 ,",
    "around 20  gev , the relation is quite different ; the dd , dr , and rr contributions all have the same order of magnitude .",
    "a similar situation was encountered in the analogous study of heavy - quark production @xcite .",
    "consequently , in the lower @xmath6 range , the cross section @xmath119 of inclusive particle production with a compton collider will serve as a powerful tool to extract information on the photon pdf s .",
    "the corresponding @xmath32 spectra for @xmath123  gev are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . as far as the relative importance of the various components is concerned",
    ", we recognize a pattern similar to fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , which refers to the integrated rapidity spectrum , at @xmath123  gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath32 spectra are quite different in shape and relative magnitude from those found in the tesla case .",
    "this may be understood by observing that the laser - photon spectrum is peaked at the upper edge .",
    "the rr component is now dominant and rather flat ; the dr component is somewhat smaller and exhibits a characteristic two - hump structure with a significant depletion in the central region ; the dd component is greatly suppressed , but exhibits a shape similar to the tesla case . as a consequence , there is a pronounced plateau in the @xmath32 spectrum of the total sum .",
    "inspired by the observations made in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we quantitatively study in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] the influence of the gluon pdf of the photon .",
    "the dashed line represents the ratio of @xmath119 with the gluon pdf switched off to the full result as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "we see that , at @xmath141 , 15 , 25 )  gev , ( 75 , 42 , 23)% of the cross section stems from the gluon pdf .",
    "the nlo photon pdf set by gordon and storrow ( gs ) @xcite differs from the grv set @xcite mainly in the gluon pdf .",
    "the ratio of @xmath119 evaluated with the gs set to the grv result is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] by the solid line , which is a smooth interpolation . obviously , the gs and grv predictions appreciably differ at small @xmath6 , by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , the nlc operated as a @xmath1 collider would provide an excellent laboratory to pin down the poorly known gluon pdf of the photon . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we also assess the sensitivity of such an experiment to the gluon ff by showing the fraction of @xmath119 due to the quark ff s ( dot - dashed line ) . at @xmath141 , 15 , 25 )  gev , ( 45 , 21 , 13)% of the cross section",
    "is related to gluon fragmentation .",
    "consequently , the @xmath1 nlc would also allow one to probe the gluon ff , which is only moderately constrained by data of inclusive hadron production via @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "we studied the inclusive production of charged hadrons in collisions of almost real photons at nlo in the framework of the qcd - improved parton model .",
    "this approach is conceptually very different from the one based on mc event generators , which is frequently followed by experimentalists to interpret their data . in these mc programs ,",
    "the various qcd processes are simulated using lo matrix elements in connection with certain model assumptions concerning the formation of hadronic final states .",
    "although these mc packages often lead to satisfactory descriptions of the data , from the theoretical point of view , their drawback is that this happens at the expense of introducing a number of ad - hoc fine - tuning parameters , which do not originate in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "furthermore , in the mc approach , it seems impossible to implement the factorization of final - state collinear singularities , which impedes a consistent extension to nlo . on the contrary , in the qcd - improved parton model",
    ", such singularities are absorbed into the bare ( infinite ) ff s so as to render them renormalized ( finite ) in a way quite similar to the procedure for the pdf s at the incoming legs . in our analysis , we used ff s extracted with nlo precision from pep and recent lep1 data on inclusive single - hadron production in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite .",
    "in fact , owing to the factorization theorem @xcite , the ff s are process independent as long as one considers unbiased single - hadron event samples . by the same token ,",
    "our formalism is less flexible than the mc approach , since we are unable to describe more complicated final states , with more than one detected hadron and acceptance cuts on observables different from our integration variables .",
    "there are various ways to realize @xmath1 processes in experiments .",
    "the conventional method is to exploit the qed bremsstrahlung which is radiated during @xmath0 reactions from the colliding beams .",
    "high - quality data of this type were collected by tasso @xcite at petra and mark  ii @xcite at pep .",
    "unfortunately , the bulk of these data are accumulated at rather small @xmath6 , where the nlo formalism is not expected to yield reliable results , and the few data points at larger @xmath6 values carry considerable error bars due to limited statistics .",
    "detailed comparison revealed that our consistent nlo calculation with up - to - date ff s was able to reduce somewhat the mismatch between theory and experiment that had previously been observed by other authors @xcite .",
    "however , especially in the case of tasso , the degree of discrepancy in the upper @xmath6 range still gives some reason for concern .",
    "while at lep1 the @xmath1 processes were overwhelmed beneath the tremendous background due to @xmath0 annihilation on the @xmath142 resonance , the situation will be much more favourable at lep2 .",
    "we presented nlo predictions for the @xmath6 and @xmath32 spectra to be measured in the oncoming lep2 phase .",
    "we verified that our nlo predictions are rather stable under scale variations ; at @xmath123  gev , the cross section only fluctuates by @xmath129 if @xmath83 is varied between 1/2 and 2 .",
    "unfortunately , except at rather low @xmath6 , the study of @xmath1 processes at lep2 will not much deepen our understanding of the nature of the gluon inside the photon and of its rle within the fragmentation process .",
    "photon - photon physics at the nlc will greatly benefit from beamstrahlung as an additional source of quasireal photons and , of course , from the increased epa logarithm . in the case of the 500-gev nlc with tesla architecture , the cross sections at @xmath141 , 15 , 25 )  gev exceed the corresponding lep2 values by factors of ( 19 , 26 , 37 ) , respectively , while the shapes of the @xmath6 and @xmath32 spectra closely resemble their lep2 counterparts .",
    "the advent of a compton collider , generated by backscattering of laser light off the @xmath2 and @xmath3 beams of the nlc , would represent an important step forward in the history of @xmath1 experimentation , and might considerably improve our knowledge of both the gluon ff and the gluon pdf of the photon . by converting the nlc ,",
    "the cross sections of inclusive charged - hadron production at @xmath141 , 15 , 25 )  gev would be increased by factors of ( 35 , 52 , 88 ) , respectively . at the same time , the relative importance of the dd channel would be dramatically reduced , so that the sensitivity to the photon pdf s would be correspondingly amplified .",
