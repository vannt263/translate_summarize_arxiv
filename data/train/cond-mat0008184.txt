    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) melting and the mathematically related systems , such as for example the normal - to - superfluid and planar paramagnet - to - ferromagnet transitions in films ( described by the 2d xy model ) are striking examples of the increased importance of thermal fluctuations in low dimensional systems.@xcite in contrast to their bulk , three- ( and higher- ) dimensional analogs , where , typically , fluctuations only lead to _ quantitative _ modifications of mean - field predictions ( e.g. , change values of critical exponents ) , here the effects are _ qualitative _ and drastic . located exactly at the lower - critical dimension ( @xmath4 ) , below which the distinction between the high and low temperature phases is erased by fluctuations",
    ", two - dimensional melting can proceed via a subtle , two - stage , _ continuous _ transition , driven by unbinding of topological defects ( dislocations and disclinations ) .",
    "this mechanism , made possible by strong thermal fluctuations , therefore provides an alternative route to a direct first - order melting , argued by landau s mean - field analysis  @xcite to be the _ exclusive _ scenario .    despite of its long history , dating back to the work of kosterlitz and thouless  @xcite , halperin and nelson,@xcite , and young@xcite ( kthny ) ( which in turn built on a large body of ideas dating back to landau and peierls@xcite ) , interest in 2d",
    "melting and related problems persist . on the theoretical side",
    "this , in part , is due to the fact that the theory of 2d melting is an unusual example of a nontrivial and quite exotic critical point that lends itself to an asymptotically _ exact _ description .",
    "furthermore , the kthny class of transitions ( 2d melting and related disordering of a 2d xy model ) provides a rare example of a thermodynamically sharp phase transitions between phases , both of which lack long range order.@xcite    although evidence for defect driven phase transitions has appeared in numerous experiments on liquid crystals@xcite and langmuir - blodgett films@xcite , finding simple model systems which exhibit these phenomena in experiments or simulations has proven to be more controversial .",
    "some system parameters appear to fall in the range in which instead it is discontinuous melting that converts a solid directly into a liquid .",
    "however , it appears , that two - stage continuous melting has been recently experimentally observed by murray _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite and zahn _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite in beautiful melting experiments on two - dimensional colloids confined between smooth glass plates and superparamagnetic colloidal systems , respectively . in these experiments , an orientationally quasi - long - range ordered but",
    "translationally disordered hexatic phase@xcite was observed .",
    "this phase , intermediate but thermodynamically distinct from the 2d solid and isotropic liquid , is an important signature of defect driven two - stage melting .",
    "in these two - dimensional colloids , particle positions and the associated topological defects can be directly imaged via digital video - microscopy , allowing precise quantitative tests of the theory .",
    "colloids are thus ideal experimental model systems to explore the details of two - dimensional melting and related phenomena , many of which are the focus of the theory presented here.@xcite    soon after the initial development of the theory of two - dimensional melting , theoretical efforts turned to the studies of the effects of substrate , an important ingredient in many physical systems .",
    "these studies@xcite uncovered a rich phenomenology stemming from the interplay between the underlying periodic substrate and a quasi - long - range ordered solid film interacting with it . while many experiments have been undertaken , with a krypton film on a graphite substrate ( see e.g. ref . for a review ) being one of the best studied , these systems are far from ideal in exploring this rich phenomenology , because of the lack of substrate tunability ; in these systems it is difficult to change the substrate period , dimensionality and pinning strength .",
    "a series of pioneering experiments by chowdhury , ackerson and clark @xcite constituted an important new development . in these studies strongly interacting colloidal particles , confined to two dimensions , were subjected to a one - dimensional periodic potential , induced by the interference fringes from two laser beams crossed in the sample .",
    "the light - induced polarization in these micron - size dielectric particles interacts with the laser electric field , leading to a radiation pressure force,@xcite directed toward the regions of high laser intensity , the antinodes maxima in the laser standing wave pattern .",
    "one of many interesting phenomena discovered by chowdhury _ etal .",
    "_ is the fixed - temperature freezing transition driven by increasing the strength of the laser potential , dubbed `` light induced freezing '' ( lif ) .",
    "qualitatively , lif is due to the suppression of thermal fluctuations transverse to the imposed periodic pinning laser potential .",
    "this intuition is also supported by a more quantitative analysis based on landau s free energy expansion in the translational order parameters ( density fourier modes ) @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the three smallest reciprocal lattice vectors of a triangular lattice . in the simplest geometry , with e.g. , @xmath7 commensurate with the laser potential , @xmath8",
    "is trivially induced by the potential even in the liquid phase .",
    "such finite @xmath9 then converts the landau s cubic coupling @xmath10 , ( which , in mean - field theory , is responsible for melting always being first - order ) into a simple upward shift in the melting temperature for the only remaining critical mode @xmath11 .",
    "not surprisingly the resulting landau expansion contains only even powers of this complex order parameter @xmath12 , which therefore generically orders via a _ continuous _ transition in the xy universality class .",
    "hence , within the mean - field description discussed by chowdhury _ etal . _",
    "@xcite , one expects to reach a tricritical point upon increasing the light intensity , beyond which the lif transition becomes continuous .",
    "however , because of the dominant role of thermal fluctuations in two - dimensional systems , such `` soft - spin '' landau expansions in order parameter amplitudes ( and the related density functional theories@xcite ) will have difficulties to capture the subtleties of the continuous topological phase transitions possible in these two - dimensional systems .",
    "unfortunately , results from monte - carlo simulations are inconclusive .",
    "although earlier simulations  @xcite claimed to have found a tricritical point at intermediate laser intensities , consistent with density functional theory , recent studies from the same laboratory  @xcite refute these results .",
    "these difficulties are perhaps unsurprising , given that even much larger scale simulations have , so far , failed to completely resolve the nature of 2d melting , even _ without _ a periodic external potential.@xcite    an alternative ( but complementary and in principle equivalent ) `` hard - spin '' defect description ( with order parameter amplitude fluctuations represented by defect cores ) , extended to include a one - dimensional periodic pinning potential may be necessary to correctly capture the rich phenomenology of the early experiments by chowdhury _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite and the recent ones by wei _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite and others .",
    "@xcite developing such a theoretical framework and exploring its details to interpret these experiments is the goal of the work presented here .",
    "our interest in this problem was stimulated by the experiments of wei _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite , which extended the light - induced melting experiments to higher laser intensities than those studied in ref ..",
    "one other notable difference is that in contrast to the strong long - range interaction of unscreened charged colloids in highly deionized solution,@xcite in the wei _ etal .",
    "_ experiments colloidal particles were interacting via a short - ranged debye potential , with ions in the solution screening the long - ranged coulomb interaction .",
    "in addition to the light - induced freezing , observed at low light intensities , the authors of ref . discovered a _",
    "reentrant _ melting phenomena , `` light - induced melting '' ( lim ) , driven by the increased strength of the laser - induced one - dimensional periodic potential .",
    "as discussed below , this fascinating reentrance phenomena _ generically _ emerges from our theoretical analysis in the limit of a short debye screening length .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the phenomena of two - dimensional melting in the presence of a one - dimensional periodic potential , and to answer many basic questions stimulated by these recent experiments .",
    "what is the nature of such melting transition , if not preempted ( as it can always be ) by the first - order transition ? more generally , how is the standard phase diagram for 2d melting on a homogeneous substrate ( which includes the 2d crystal , hexatic and liquid phases ) modified by the periodic laser potential ? which of the phases survive the light field and what new ones emerge in its presence ?",
    "the answers to these and many other questions , provided below , lead to results consistent with experimental observations , and have many testable consequences for the possible future experiments .      even in the liquid phase at high temperatures the laser interference fringes , which we choose to run along the @xmath13-axis ,",
    "induce a periodic density modulation in the colloidal liquid . as a consequence the static structure function @xmath14 displays bragg peaks at @xmath15 ,",
    "the integer multiples ( @xmath16 ) of the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath17 of the imposed one - dimensional periodic potential with trough spacing @xmath2.@xcite the liquid phase density exhibits a _",
    "finite _ linear response to such a periodic perturbation with amplitude @xmath18 , which is proportional to the input laser intensity @xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of chowdhury _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite who found the scattered laser intensity , @xmath20 , at these directly induced bragg peaks , to scale as a cube of the input laser power @xmath19.@xcite these explicitly induced features of the modulated liquid persist throughout the phase diagram , with the additional structure emerging as a result of numerous _ spontaneous _ symmetry breakings , which we discuss below .",
    "the laser - induced periodic potential also _ explicitly _ breaks continuous 2d rotational symmetry down to @xmath21 symmetry ( rotations by @xmath22 ) .",
    "consequently , the one - dimensional periodic potential induces nematic , square , hexatic and higher orientational harmonics long - range orders , respectively characterized by a 2n - atic bond orientational order parameter @xmath23 , which , independent of any other details , are nonzero throughout the phase diagram .",
    "therefore , in particular , the laser potential eliminates the continuous transition from an isotropic liquid to a hexatic liquid phase , expected in two - dimensional liquids in the absence of an external potential.@xcite this situation is analogous to a ferromagnet in a magnetic field , where the qualitative distinction between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases is erased by the external magnetic field , with both phases displaying a finite induced magnetization .    since the hexatic orientational order is _ explicitly _ induced by the laser potential , it must vanish as the laser field is tuned to zero .",
    "analogously to a power - law vanishing of the magnetization with an external magnetic field in a ferromagnet at its critical point , we predict that at low input light intensities , @xmath19 , the orientational order parameter vanishes as a _ universal _ power of @xmath19 , @xmath24 with @xmath25@xcite in the liquid phase and @xmath26 in the hexatic phase , where @xmath27 is the exponent describing the algebraic decay of bond orientational order in the absense of the laser - induced periodic potential.@xcite we expect @xmath28 to approach a nonzero @xmath19-independent constant in the solid phase , consistent with the _ spontaneous _ long - range hexatic order of the 2d crystal , even in the absence of a periodic potential .",
    "all other details of the phase diagram and the properties of the phases for our system strongly depend on the level of commensurability between the two - dimensional colloidal crystal , in the absence of the laser field , and the one - dimensional periodic potential that it induces .",
    "this in turn is determined by two ingredients : ( i ) the orientation of the triangular colloidal lattice relative to that of the periodic potential troughs , which selects a set of bragg planes that run parallel to the troughs , ( ii ) the commensurability ratio of the spacing @xmath1 between these bragg planes to the period @xmath2 of the laser potential , defined by @xmath29 . in this paper",
    "we will primarily focus on the commensurate case defined by @xmath30 and defer the rich phenomenology of the incommensurate case and the commensurate - incommensurate transitions to a later publication.@xcite    for these commensurate densities , independent of the order of commensurability , @xmath3 , at the lowest temperatures we always find that our system freezes into a novel type of a crystal , which we call a `` locked floating solid '' ( lfs ) .",
    "this phase derives its apparently contradictory name from its novel highly anisotropic properties : while the solid is pinned transversely to the troughs of the periodic potential , executing only massive optical phonon - like excitations in that direction , it is able to slide freely along the potential minima with acoustic phonon excitations within the troughs . upon integrating out the massive @xmath31-modes and using standard renormalization group methods @xcite to eliminate bound dislocation pairs in the lfs phase ,",
    "we are left with a free energy with temperature and potential strength dependent _ effective _ elastic constants , @xmath32 the structure function of lfs is quite unusual . like the high temperature modulated liquid discussed above",
    ", the lfs displays a set of delta - function bragg peaks ( reduced by the debye - waller factor ) located at the multiples of the laser potential reciprocal lattice vector @xmath33 , which coexist with other _ spontaneously _ induced bragg and quasi - bragg peaks .",
    "the more detailed properties of the lfs and other phases exhibited by our system , strongly depend on the choice of the infinite set of colloidal crystal orientations relative to the light interference fringes .",
    "while we will explore these numerous possibilities in their full generality in the main body of the manuscript , in this subsection we summarize our results only for the simplest orientation studied in the experiments of refs.@xcite , in which the periodic potential troughs run parallel to the _ primary _ bragg planes.@xcite    experimentally , we expect our system to display a considerable amount of irreversibility , with the choice of the relative orientation highly dependent on the way the system is taken into the crystal state : if the laser potential is turned on in the liquid phase ( field - cooled ) , the crystal will freeze into the lowest energy orientation consistent with the imposed colloidal density ( or the chemical potential ) and laser fringe spacing;@xcite in contrast , in zero - laser - field cooling experiments , an already formed crystal may be unable to reorient significantly , and will therefore lock into a metastable orientation , determined by the plane of the two interfering laser beams .",
    "= 0.9    once we focus on the primary orientation , illustrated for @xmath34 in fig.[fig : dislocation ] , the phenomenology of our system is completely determined by the integer commensurability ratio @xmath3 .",
    "as we will show , for commensurate densities , our system admits three phase diagram topologies , corresponding to the three ranges of the values of @xmath3 : ( i ) @xmath35,@xcite ( ii ) @xmath36 , and ( iii ) @xmath37 , with the critical value of @xmath38 for the primary orientation .      for @xmath35,@xcite",
    "we find the phase behavior of the 2d colloidal system as summarized by the phase diagram illustrated in fig.[fig : phase_diagram_p=1 ] .",
    "= 0.9    because the sharp distinction between the hexatic and isotropic liquid phase is absent in the presence of a periodic potential , this phase diagram contains only two thermodynamically distinct phases at finite @xmath18 : the modulated liquid and the simplest @xmath35 `` locked floating solid '' ( lfs ) .",
    "we can estimate the order of magnitude of the transition temperature between the lfs and liquid phases in terms of microscopic elastic constants ( similar to those appearing in eq.[eq : kt_free_energy ] ) as follows : in the limit of strong laser potential the particles are confined to a parallel array of equally spaced 1d channels of spacing @xmath2 , illustrated in fig.[fig:1d_channels ] . if @xmath39 is the particle displacement field along the n - th channel , we can write the energy of these weakly coupled one - dimensional rows of particles as @xmath40\\biggr\\}\\ ; , \\label{h - weak_coupling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the bare compressional elastic modulus within each channel and @xmath42 is the microscopic coupling between the channels determining the shear modulus of the 2d system.@xcite at high temperatures or weak microscopic coupling @xmath42 , the colloid decomposes into an orientationally ordered two - dimensional liquid of decoupled one - dimensional channels . at temperature @xmath43 , the phonon fluctuations within a channel then grow according to @xmath44 as can be seen from the equipartition theorem . upon choosing @xmath13 such that the root mean square phonon fluctuations equal the intrachannel particle spacing @xmath45 , we determine a translational correlation length @xmath46 , which diverges at low temperatures @xmath47    = 0.99    the channels will couple to form a coherent two - dimensional lfs when the effective coupling @xmath48 between correlated 1d regions of size @xmath46 surpasses the thermal energy @xmath49 which decorrelates the 1d channels .",
    "we associate this characteristic temperature with the melting temperature @xmath50 of lfs , which is therefore given by @xmath51 a similar argument leads to the estimate for freezing into the three - dimensional locked floating solid phases discussed by carraro  @xcite for rare gas atoms adsorbed into bundles of carbon nanotubes . as we describe in appendix  [ variational_appendix ] , in terms of the weakly coupled model , eq.[h - weak_coupling ] , freezing into lfs takes place at strong coupling @xmath42 , and therefore does not allow a rigorous renormalization group treatment of the transition .",
    "nevertheless an approximate variational treatment is possible and is presented in appendix  [ variational_appendix ] .    instead",
    ", here we take an alternative route to the study of the lfs melting and other transitions by working within a continuum elastic model eq.[eq : kt_free_energy ] , which is equivalent to the strong coupling ( between the channels ) limit of the descrete model in eq.[h - weak_coupling ] .",
    "such approach allows a more refined and asymptotically exact renormalization group analysis ( presented below ) , within which we find that for @xmath35 the melting of the lfs phase is in the universality class of the xy model , and is driven by unbinding of dislocation pairs with burgers vectors @xmath52 along the troughs of the periodic potential .",
    "consequently , in contrast to the conventional 2d melting transition , at the melting temperature @xmath53 , we predict a _ universal _ ratio of the jump in the geometric mean of the long wavelength effective shear and bulk moduli , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( describing the elasticity of the lfs phase ) to @xmath53 ,",

    "the striking effect of turning on an external 1d periodic potential is that it can lead to two thermodynamically distinct uniaxially distorted hexagonal crystal phases , which we term a `` locked floating solid '' ( lfs ) and a `` floating solid '' ( fs ) . being crystalline , both of these phases exhibit 2d translational ( quasi - long - range ) order , and are characterized by a finite shear modulus .",

    "the floating solid can be rigorously differentiated from its locked counterpart as a 2d colloidal crystal phase in which the periodic potential is _ irrelevant _ in the renormalization group sense .",

    "however , these similarities do not extend to all correlation functions , and the periodic pinning potential has important qualitative consequences for the fs phase that distinguish it from an ordinary 2d solid .",
    "the `` irrelevance '' of the periodic potential means only that a perturbative expansion in @xmath18 , for a sufficiently small value is _",
    "convergent_. consequently , average quantities , that are finite at @xmath231 can be well approximated by their @xmath231-values , i.e. , working with @xmath232 , as is usually done .",
    "however , quantities that _ vanish _ ( or diverge ) to this zeroth order , must be evaluated to the next lowest order in @xmath18 to obtain a nontrivial ( finite ) result .",
    "to illustrate this point , recall that the periodic potential _",
    "explicitly _ breaks rotational and translational symmetry , despite its irrelevance in the fs phase .",
    "while the former leads to uniaxial anisotropy in the hexagonal lattice , the latter is responsible for the true long - range order in the translational order parameter @xmath233 , with @xmath90 integer multiples of the wave vector @xmath124 characterizing the periodicity of the external potential . in the presence of the periodic potential , even the most disordered modulated liquid phase ( see below ) displays true long - range translational and orientational order .",

    "in more recent simulations@xcite @xmath597 is found to increase monotonically with potential strength with no sign for reentrance .",
    "this is opposite to what was found in the earlier simulations by the same group@xcite .",
    "= 0.9    in summary , we find that our theoretical results are consistent with recent experiments and raise strong doubts on the validity of the monte - carlo results to date on melting in a 1d periodic potential .",
    "this latter failure of simulations is not completely surprising given difficulties of numerical methods on even larger systems to resolved the nature of 2d melting even _ without _ an external potential  @xcite .",
    "the quantity that is most directly observed in many experiments on colloidal systems and related simulations is the pair correlation function , defined by @xmath598 where the double sum is over @xmath599 particles but excludes the diagonal terms where @xmath600 .",
    "it is related to the static structure factor by @xmath601 neglecting the smooth part of the structure factor and taking into account only the center column of bragg peaks and the two neighboring columns of quasi - bragg peaks with @xmath602 and @xmath603 , respectively , one finds for the pair correlation function , @xmath604 where @xmath605 are the exponents characteristic for the lfs phase .",

    "the amplitudes @xmath608 are proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding bragg peaks , @xmath609 , and quasi - bragg peaks , @xmath610 and @xmath611 with @xmath612 and @xmath613 ( see eqs.[b_ga][a_gb ] ) .    for @xmath614 ,",
    "i.e. , looking parallel to the minima of the troughs the sum over the bragg peaks yields a constant .",
    "this simply reflects the effect of the laser potential to induce a periodic modulation of the colloidal particle density with a higher density in the minima of the troughs .",
    "note that this trivially implies that the pair correlation function does _ not _ approach unity as @xmath615 if @xmath616 is normalized with respect to the mean density .",
    "since the amplitudes for the quasi - bragg peaks decay as a power - law in the strength of the laser potential with an exponent proportional to @xmath617 a reasonable approximation for the pair correlation function reads @xmath618 the relative magnitude of the amplitudes @xmath619 and @xmath620 depends on the strength of the laser potential . whereas @xmath620 is independent of @xmath18 ( note that the leading quasi bragg - peak contributing to @xmath620 has @xmath621 ) , @xmath619 vanishes as a nontrivial @xmath43-dependent power law in @xmath18 for @xmath622 ( see eq.[b_gb ] ) increasing the weight of the @xmath623term with increasing potential strength",
    "this prediction should be accessible to experimental verification .",
    "note , that the dependence of the amplitude @xmath619 on the potential strength may lead to @xmath18-dependent effective exponents when one tries to incorrectly fit the experimental data by a single power law . for illustration fig.[fig : structure_factor_x ] shows @xmath624 for a special case , where @xmath625 , @xmath626 , @xmath627 , @xmath628 and all length are measured in units of @xmath45 .",
    "due to the superposition of the two harmonics with different power law amplitudes the minima are much broader than the maxima of the structure factor , a feature which appears to be present in the data of ref.@xcite .",
    "= 0.9    = 0.9    for @xmath629 , i.e. , looking perpendicular to the minima of the troughs we get , @xmath630 with @xmath631 .",
    "hence on top of the periodic density modulation due to the laser potential we have again the algebraic decay from the closest bragg peaks . for illustration fig.[fig : structure_factor_y ] shows the algebraic part of the static structure factor @xmath632 where we have again chosen the amplitudes to be equal and the @xmath633 exponents equal to their values at the melting temperature , @xmath634 , @xmath635 . if one would try to fit the envelope of this function in the regime shown in the graph using a single power law one would find an exponent of @xmath636 .",
