    "the last ten years have witnessed an enormous progress in our knowledge of the optical properties of supernovae ( sne ) of all types . however , comparatively little is still known about these objects in near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths . given the rapid technological development of nir light detection over recent years , in 1999 we started a program to obtain optical and nir photometry and spectroscopy of nearby sne ( @xmath1@xmath20.08 ) .",
    "so far , the `` supernova optical and infrared survey '' ( soirs ) program has gathered high - quality observations for @xmath320 sne .",
    "so far we have reported results for the bright type ii sn  1999em @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report spectroscopic observations of two of the best - observed objects included in our program , the type ia sn  1999ee and the type ib / c sn  1999ex , both of which exploded in the same galaxy within three weeks .",
    "sn  1999ee was discovered by m. wischnjewsky on a film taken on 1999 october 7.15 ( jd 2451458.65 ) in the course of the el roble survey @xcite .",
    "the sn exploded 10 arcsec east and 10 arcsec south of the nucleus of the spiral galaxy ic 5179 , a very active star - forming galaxy with a heliocentric redshift of 3,498 km  s@xmath4 . the optical spectrum taken on 1999",
    "october 9.10 revealed the defining si ii @xmath06355 feature of the type ia class @xcite .",
    "the high expansion velocity of 15,700 km  s@xmath4 deduced from this line and the faint apparent magnitude at discovery ( @xmath317.5 ) indicated that this object had been found several days before maximum light . at the distance of the host galaxy",
    "sn  1999ee offered the promise to reach @xmath5=14.5 about 10 days later , thus proving to be an excellent target for a detailed study of a sn ia early since explosion , both at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "this discovery occurred at the very beginning of one of the soirs follow - up runs , previously scheduled for 1999 october - november , so we decided to give first priority to sn  1999ee . the unique opportunity afforded by sn  1999ee led the eso director general to allocate director s discretionary time to this project in order to secure the best possible data for sn  1999ee .",
    "as a result of this effort we obtained a superb dataset of optical / ir photometric and spectroscopic observations of the first 50 days of the evolution of sn  1999ee .",
    "three weeks after the discovery of sn  1999ee , a second sn exploded in the same galaxy that hosted sn  1999ee .",
    "the discovery of sn  1999ex was made by martin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on 1999 november 9.51 ut ( jd 2451492.01 ) in the course of the parg automated supernova search at perth observatory .",
    "they reported that the sn was not visible in a deep exposure taken on 1999 october 25.58 ( estimated limiting mag 19 ) , and that the object was slowly brightening . a spectrum taken on 1999",
    "november 14.13 @xcite showed that sn  1999ex had close resemblance to that of the type ic sn 1994i taken near maximum light @xcite .",
    "this led us initially to classify sn  1999ex as a ic event although we believe that it should be typed as an intermediate ib / c object ( see sec .",
    "[ sn99ex.sec ] ) .",
    "as soon as this object was discovered we decided to include it in our optical / ir spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "the observations gathered for sne  1999ee and 1999ex have an unprecedented temporal and wavelength coverage and afford the possibility to carry out a detailed comparison with atmosphere models . in this paper",
    "we report the spectroscopic observations of sne  1999ee and 1999ex and we discuss these results .",
    "the spectra presented here are available in electronic form to other researchers ( contact m. h. if interested ) .",
    "optical and ir photometry will be published and discussed in detail elsewhere by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we obtained optical and ir spectra of sne  1999ee and 1999ex with the eso ntt / emmi / sofi , the danish 1.5-m / dfosc equipments at la silla , and the vlt / isaac instrument at cerro paranal between 1999 october 9 and 1999 november 28 .",
    "we also obtained three optical spectra with the ctio  4-m telescope on 1999 october 9 , the ctio  1.5-m telescope on 1999 october 27 , and the las campanas dupont 2.5-m telescope on 1999 october 16 .",
    "table 1 gives the journal of the observations .",
    "the ntt observations comprised three different setups .",
    "we used the blue channel of emmi equipped with a tek ccd ( 1024x1024 ) and grating 5 ( 158 lines mm@xmath4 ) which , in first order , delivered spectra with a dispersion of 3.5    pix@xmath4 and a useful wavelength range between 0.330 and 0.525 @xmath6 . with the red channel ,",
    "ccd tek 2048 , and grating 13 ( 150 lines mm@xmath4 ) the dispersion was 2.7    pix@xmath4 and the spectral coverage included from 0.470 through 1.100 @xmath6 in first order . since this setup had potential second - order contamination beyond @xmath30.6 @xmath6 we decided to take one spectrum with the og530 filter and a second observation without the filter , in order to provide an overlap with the blue spectrum .",
    "thus , a single - epoch observation comprised three spectra .    the observations with emmi started with calibrations during day time ( bias and dome flat - field exposures ) .",
    "the night began with the observation of a spectrophotometric standard ( from the list of @xcite ) through a wide slit of 10 arcsec , after which we observed the sne with a slit of 1 arcsec . before the discovery of sn  1999ex on 1999 november 9 we oriented the slit along the line connecting sn  1999ee and the host galaxy nucleus . on 1999",
    "november 14 and 19 , on the other hand , we oriented the slit along the two sne in order to get simultaneous spectra .",
    "since the airmass of our observations was always below 1.5 we do not expect serious systematic errors in the observed fluxes due to atmospheric refraction .",
    "we took two exposures of the sne per spectral setup , each of the same length ( typically 300 - 600 sec ) . immediately following this observation we observed a he - ar lamp , at the same position of the sne and before changing the optical setup in order to ensure an accurate wavelength calibration . at the end of the night",
    "we observed a second flux standard .",
    "we also used the danish 1.5-m telescope and the dfosc instrument at la silla on five nights , between 1999 october 20 and november 28 , in order to improve the temporal coverage of our spectroscopic observations . in all cases we employed a 2k@xmath72k loral ccd and two different grisms to secure a spectral coverage comparable to that obtained with emmi .",
    "with grism 3 ( 400 lines mm@xmath4 ) we covered a useful wavelength range between 0.33 and 0.66 @xmath6 with a dispersion of 2.3    pix@xmath4 . with grism 5 ( 300 lines mm@xmath4 ) we sampled the range between 0.53 and 0.98 @xmath6 at 3.1    pix@xmath4 .",
    "the red setup produced spectra with significant fringing beyond 0.75 @xmath6 which we did not attempt to remove .",
    "we observed the sne with a slit of 2 arcsec .",
    "although we did not rotate the slit along the parallactic angle , we obtained the first four spectra with airmass @xmath21.1 . the last spectrum taken on 1999 november 28 ,",
    "on the other hand , might suffer from atmospheric refraction since we obtained it with an airmass between 1.4 - 2.0 .",
    "we took two 1200 sec exposures of the sne per grism , followed by a he - ne arc lamp exposure , and spectra of a flux standard with a 5 arcsec slit .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of sn  1999ee on 1999 october 9 ( two days after discovery ) with the r - c spectrograph of the ctio  4-m telescope , a 3k@xmath71k loral ccd , and grating kpgl-2 ( 316 lines mm@xmath4 ) in first order .",
    "we took one 1800 sec exposure of the sn ( through thick cirrus ) with a 1.5 arcsec slit oriented along the parallactic angle , a he - ar lamp exposure , and spectra of three flux standards through a 10 arcsec slit .",
    "the resulting sn spectrum had a dispersion of 1.9    pix@xmath4 and useful wavelength coverage of 0.33 - 0.87 @xmath6 .",
    "second - order contamination was expected beyond 0.66 @xmath6 since we did not include a blocking filter in the optical path .",
    "we obtained another spectrum at ctio with the 1.5-m telescope and the r - c spectrograph on 1999 october 27 . in this case",
    "we used a 1200@xmath7800 loral ccd , grating 58 ( 400 lines mm@xmath4 ) in second order , a 2 arcsec slit , and a cuso@xmath8 order - blocking filter .",
    "the resulting spectrum had a dispersion of 1.1    pix@xmath4 and useful wavelength coverage of 0.37 - 0.50 @xmath6 .",
    "we obtained six 1200 sec exposures of sn  1999ee at an airmass @xmath2 1.1 , a he - ar lamp image , and two spectra of flux standards .",
    "we also obtained a spectrum of sn  1999ee on 1999 october 16 with the las campanas dupont 2.5-m telescope and the wide field ccd spectrograph .",
    "we used a 2048@xmath72048 tek ccd and a blue grism .",
    "the resulting spectrum had a dispersion of 3    pix@xmath4 and useful wavelength coverage of 0.36 - 0.92 @xmath6 .",
    "second - order contamination was expected beyond 0.66 @xmath6 since we did not use a blocking filter .",
    "the reductions consisted in subtracting the overscan and bias from every frame .",
    "next , we constructed a normalized flat - field from the quartz - lamp image , duly normalized along the dispersion axis .",
    "we proceeded by flat - fielding all of the object frames and extracting 1-d spectra from the 2-d images .",
    "we followed the same procedure for the he - ar frames which we used to derive the wavelength calibration for the sne .",
    "then we derived a response curve from the two flux stars , which we applied to the sn spectra , in order to get flux calibrated spectra . from the pair of flux - calibrated spectra that we obtained for each spectral setup we removed cosmic rays and obtained a clean spectrum of each sn .",
    "the last step consisted in merging the spectra obtained with the different spectroscopic setups . to avoid discontinuities in the combined spectrum we grey - shifted the three spectra relative to each other using the overlap regions . finally , we computed the synthetic @xmath5-band magnitude from the resulting spectra ( following the precepts described in appendix b of @xcite ) and we grey - shifted them so that the flux level matched our observed @xmath5 magnitudes .",
    "we checked the spectrophotometric quality of the spectra by computing @xmath9 synthetic magnitudes and comparing them to the observed @xmath9 magnitudes of @xcite . excluding the spectra obtained on 1999 november 14 , this test yielded the following mean differences : @xmath10-@xmath11=-0.05@xmath120.05 , @xmath13-@xmath14=0.00@xmath120.07 , and @xmath15-@xmath16=0.00@xmath120.09 , which implies that the relative spectrophotometry at these wavelengths is accurate to 10% or better .",
    "the november 14 spectrum , on the other hand , shows @xmath17 fluxes that fall 0.35 mag lower than the photometric @xmath17 magnitudes and @xmath18 fluxes that exceed by 0.2 mag the observed broadband @xmath18 magnitudes , perhaps owing to atmospheric refraction effects .",
    "we obtained five ir spectra with the vlt / antu telescope at cerro paranal , between 1999 october 9 and november 28 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we employed the ir spectro - imager isaac @xcite in low resolution mode ( r@xmath3500 ) , with four different gratings that permitted us to obtain spectra in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 bands .",
    "we used these gratings in 5@xmath23 , 4@xmath23 , 3@xmath24 and 2@xmath25 order , respectively , which yielded useful data in the spectral ranges 0.984 - 1.136 , 1.109 - 1.355 , 1.415 - 1.818 , and 1.846 - 2.560 @xmath6 .",
    "the light detector was a hawaii - rockwell 1024x1024 array .",
    "a typical ir observation started during daytime by taking calibrations .",
    "we began taking flat - field images using an internal source of continuum light .",
    "we obtained multiple on and off image pairs with the same slit used during the night ( 0.6 arcsec ) .",
    "we then took xe - ar lamp images ( with the lamp on and off ) with a narrow slit ( 0.3 arcsec ) in order to map geometric distortions .",
    "the observations of the sne consisted in an abbaab cycle , where a is an image of the sne offset by 70 arcsec along the slit relative to the b image .",
    "this technique of nodding the objects along the slit allowed us to use the a image as an on - source observation and the b image as the off - source sky frame , and viceversa . at each position we exposed for 240 sec ,",
    "conveniently split into two 120-sec images in order to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels from the final spectra .",
    "after completing the abbaab cycle we immediately obtained a pair of on - off arc lamp exposures without moving the telescope or changing optical elements to ensure an accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "we then switched to the next grating and repeated the above object - arc procedure until completing the observations with the four setups .",
    "for flux calibration we decided to observe a bright solar - analog star , close in the sky to the sne in order to minimize variations in the atmospheric absorptions @xcite .",
    "the selected star was hip 109508 , of spectral type g3v , @xmath5=8.0 , @xmath17-@xmath5=0.59 , and located only 3@xmath26 from the sne . in this case",
    "we took two ab pairs for each grating . to avoid saturating the detector",
    ", we took the shortest possible exposures ( 1.77 sec ) allowed by the electronics that controlled the detector .",
    "since the minimum time required before offsetting the telescope was @xmath360 sec , we took ten exposures at each position which provided an exceedingly good signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for the flux standard .",
    "our data reduction procedures were explained in detail by @xcite , so we include here only a brief summary .",
    "after dividing all of the object images by a normalized flat - field , we performed a first - order sky subtraction by subtracting the a images from the b exposures ( and viceversa ) .",
    "we then shifted the a - b image relative to the b - a image in the spatial direction until matching the two spectra , and we added the shifted a - b image to the b - a image so that the resulting frame lacked any sky background , except for the pixel - to - pixel fluctuations expected from photon statistics and readout noise .",
    "we then extracted 1-d spectra of the objects from the sky - subtracted frames , making sure to subtract residual dc offset and galaxy light from a window adjacent to the object . for flux calibration",
    "we adopted the technique described by @xcite , which consists in dividing the spectrum of interest by a solar - type star to remove the strong telluric ir features , and multiplying the resulting spectrum by the solar spectrum to eliminate the intrinsic features ( pseudonoise ) introduced by the solar - type star . before using the solar spectrum we convolved it with a kernel function in order to reproduce the spectral resolution of the solar - analog standard hip 109508",
    ", we shifted it in wavelength according to the radial velocity ( 68 km  s@xmath4 ) of hip 109508 , and we scaled it down to the equivalent of @xmath5=8.0 which corresponds to the observed magnitude of hip 109508 .",
    "this technique worked very well to remove telluric lines . on the other hand",
    ", it introduced a small systematic error in the flux calibration of the sn due to departures between the solar spectrum and the actual spectral energy distribution of the solar - analog standard . according to atmosphere models the difference in continuum flux for stars with @xmath27=5,500 and 6,000",
    "k ( which correspond to spectral types g8v - f9v , @xcite ) is smaller than 10% in the nir region .",
    "a g3v star like hip 109508 has nearly the same spectral type of the sun , so its effective temperature must be close ( within @xmath12100 k ) to that of the adopted solar model . hence , the flux difference between the solar - analog standard and the adopted spectrum should be less than 10% .",
    "the @xmath28=0.59 color of hip 109508 suggests little or no reddening so the relative spectrophotometry is probably accurate to 5% or better .",
    "the result of these operations were four spectra covering the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 bands , which we combined into one final ir spectrum for each sn . given the significant overlap of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 band spectra , we were able to grey - shift the @xmath20 spectrum relative to the @xmath19 spectrum .",
    "then we used our broad - band @xmath29 magnitudes to grey - shift the individual spectra .    on six occasions",
    "we used the ntt / sofi instrument at la silla in service observing mode , in order to complement the ir spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "we employed a hawaii - rockwell 1024x1024 light detector , and the blue and red grisms that permitted us to obtain spectra in the ranges 0.95 - 1.64 @xmath6 and 1.53 - 2.52 @xmath6 , with resolutions of 7.0 and 10.2  , respectively .",
    "we obtained the spectra with slit widths between 0.6 and 1 arcsec .",
    "we nodded the objects along the slit , after exposing for 150 sec at each position .",
    "we completed several pairs of ab observations for the sne , we took xe - ne arc images at the position of the targets , and we observed the flux standard hip 109508 .",
    "we reduced these data following the same procedure explained above for isaac .",
    "the large overlap of 1.53 - 1.64 @xmath6 between the blue and red spectra allowed us to grey - shift the red spectra relative to blue spectra , except on 1999 october 18 when we were only able to obtain the red spectrum .",
    "finally , we shifted the resulting spectra using the observed @xmath29 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "before analyzing the spectroscopic observations it proves necessary to mention the photometric properties of sn  1999ee . a detailed discussion of the photometric observations can be found in @xcite . in brief , the decline rate of @xmath30@xmath31=0.94 puts sn  1999ee in the group of slowest - declining sne  ia . after correcting the observed magnitudes for @xmath22 terms and dust extinction , and assuming a hubble constant of 63 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 @xcite , sn  1999ee had a peak visual magnitude of @xmath32=-19.94 ( jd 2451469.1 ) .",
    "these values lie comfortably well with the peak magnitude - decline rate relation for sne  ia @xcite .",
    "this analysis reveals that sn  1999ee was a luminous type ia event and a very interesting object to check the claim by @xcite that slow - declining events display spectroscopic peculiarities before maximum light .",
    "figure [ sn99ee.opt.fig ] displays the optical spectra of sn  1999ee in the rest - frame of the sn , after correcting the observed spectra for the 3,498 km  s@xmath4 recession velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "we also dereddened the spectra assuming a galactic reddening of @xmath33=0.02 @xcite , and a host galaxy reddening of @xmath33=0.30 derived from the sn optical colors @xcite and optical / ir colors @xcite .",
    "the strongest telluric lines are indicated with the @xmath34 symbol .",
    "the first spectrum , taken on jd 2451460.56 ( 9 days before maximum ) , exhibited a blue continuum and the characteristic p - cygni profile of the si ii @xmath06355 line of sne  ia .",
    "other prominent features in this spectrum were the absorption at @xmath33200    attributed to co ii , the ca ii h&k @xmath353934,3968 blend , mg ii @xmath04481 , the blend of lines attributed to fe ii , si ii , s ii around 4550 - 5050   , and the ca ii @xmath358498,8542,8662 triplet .",
    "the presence of the na i d @xmath355890,5896 , ca ii @xmath03934 , and ca ii @xmath03968 interstellar lines with equivalent widths of 2.3 , 0.8 , and 0.6   , respectively , revealed a non - negligible amount of absorption in the host galaxy , which agrees with the color analysis of sn  1999ee . by maximum light",
    "the `` w '' shaped s ii @xmath355454,5640 feature was well developed and the ca lines were significantly stronger .",
    "si ii @xmath04129 was already present although it was quite weak .",
    "the si ii @xmath05972 line also was weak relative to si ii @xmath06355 .",
    "nugent et al .",
    "( 1995 ) defined the parameter @xmath36(si  ii ) as the relative fluxes of this pair of lines and found a tight correlation with the sn luminosity . in this case",
    "we obtained @xmath36(si  ii)=0.23 which corresponds to the value of a luminous sne  ia , in good concordance with the decline rate of @xmath30@xmath31=0.94 and the peak magnitudes derived from the photometric observations . by day 20",
    "the spectrum was much redder .",
    "the si ii @xmath06355 line was very weak , the ca triplet had a pronounced p - cygni profile , and the region between 4000 - 5500   was dominated by strong features due to fe ii transitions .",
    "the absorption attributed to na i d @xmath355890,5896 was very prominent .",
    "overall , these data showed that sn  1999ee was a genuine type ia event with the usual spectral features of other normal sne  ia , usually known as branch - normal @xcite .",
    "figure [ sn99ee.vel.fig ] presents the expansion velocities derived from the absorption minima of si ii @xmath06355 , after correcting for the recession velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "apparently the velocity derived from si ii @xmath06355 decreased rapidly from 16,000 to 10,000 km s@xmath4 between days -7 and -2 , after which the velocity decreased slowly . for comparison",
    "we include as solid line the velocities for sn  1990n which was also caught several days before maximum @xcite .",
    "both sne showed an inflection in the velocity curve . before maximum , however , the expansion of sn  1999ee was somewhat higher compared to contemporary velocities of sn  1990n . at maximum light and later times , on the other hand , both sne had similar velocities .",
    "figure [ sn99ee.ir1.fig ] shows the resulting rest - frame ir spectra of sn  1999ee . the first spectrum , taken nine days before maximum , was quite featureless .",
    "a weak absorption line could be seen at 10520   with a weak emission component that seemed to constitute a p - cygni profile .",
    "this feature was observed for the first time in an early - time spectrum of sn  1994d and was tentatively identified as due to either he i @xmath010830 or mg ii @xmath010926 @xcite . according to the atmosphere models computed by @xcite , this feature should be due to mg ii since the amount of he in their models is not sufficient to form a line .",
    "this implies that the minimum of the mg absorption had an expansion velocity of 11,100 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "an emission due to fe iii @xcite was also present around 12550  .",
    "there was an indication of a p - cygni profile with the absorption minimum at 16160    and peak emission at 16840   .",
    "this feature was also present in the sn  1994d spectrum .",
    "the theoretical modeling of wheeler et al .",
    "suggests that this line is due to si ii , although it might have a fe ii component @xcite . at longer wavelengths the spectrum is even more featureless except for a small p - cygni line with a minimum at 19590    and peak at 20440   .",
    "the emission component was also noted in sn  1994d and was attributed to si iii by wheeler et al .    by maximum light",
    "the mg ii @xmath010926 , fe iii , and si ii feature near 16500   became more prominent and a peak developed around 18100  .",
    "one week past maximum the spectrum was dramatically different and became dominated by strong absorption / emission features .",
    "the mg ii @xmath010926 line disappeared and a weak feature at 10000    became evident , possibly forming a p - cygni profile .",
    "the most remarkable features were the strong and wide ( fwhm @xmath3 12,000 km  s@xmath4 ) peaks attributed to blends of co ii , fe ii , and ni ii at 15500 and 17500   @xcite .",
    "two weeks after maximum these peaks developed even further and new peaks appeared at 19900 and 21000  .",
    "a series of unidentified absorptions also could be observed in the @xmath20 band at 10400 , 10700 , and 11100  .",
    "one month after maximum two additional broad emission peaks became evident at 22500 and 23600   which , according to wheeler et al . , are caused by iron - group elements ( co , ni ) as well as intermediate mass elements with appreciable contribution from si . while the broad emissions appeared to redshift significantly as the sn evolved , the features that we identify as absorptions did not show any appreciable change in velocity .",
    "figure [ sn99ex.opt.fig ] displays the optical spectra of sn  1999ex in the sn rest - frame .",
    "the first spectrum , obtained on jd 2451496.62 ( one day before @xmath17 maximum ) , was characterized by a reddish continuum and several broad absorption / emission features due to ca ii h&k @xmath353934,3968 , fe ii , mg i , na i d @xmath355890,5896 , si ii @xmath06355 , and the ca triplet with a clear p - cygni profile .",
    "we also found convincing evidence for he i @xmath356678,7065 with expansion velocities of 6,000 km  s@xmath4 ( similar to velocities displayed by the fe , mg , na , si , and o lines ) .",
    "it is possible that the feature at @xmath34400   , usually attributed to a blend of mg ii and fe ii , had a contribution due to the he i @xmath04471 .",
    "likewise , the feature at @xmath34800   could be a blend of fe ii @xmath04924 and he i @xmath04921 , while the na i d @xmath355890,5896 doublet could have a contribution from he i @xmath05876 .",
    "interstellar lines due to na i d @xmath355890,5896 ,",
    "ca ii @xmath03934 , and ca ii @xmath03968 were observed in absorption with equivalent widths of 2.8 , 1.8 , 0.9   , at the wavelengths corresponding to the rest - frame of the host galaxy . according to the correlation between equivalent widths and reddening for galactic stars @xcite , sn  1999ex was reddened by @xmath33@xmath31.0@xmath37 .",
    "however , there appears to be a significant departure of sne from this calibration @xcite , so this estimate is very uncertain .",
    "the first spectrum of sn  1999ex bore quite resemblance to that of sn  1994i .",
    "@xcite argued that sn  1994i was a type ic event on the grounds that this object 1 ) did not show evidence for hydrogen lines ( ruling out a type ii event ) , 2 ) had a si ii @xmath06355 line more subtle than in classical sne ia , and 3 ) he i @xmath05876 was absent or weak ( and blended with na d ) ( ruling out a type ib event ) .",
    "based on the resemblance between these two spectra , we initially classified sn  1999ex as a type ic sn @xcite .",
    "the relatively stronger he lines displayed by sn  1999ex suggest that this object could well be an intermediate case between the ib and ic subclasses ( we will return to this point in section [ sn99ex.sec ] ) . during the following two weeks the sn spectrum evolved slowly and most of the lines became stronger .",
    "figure [ sn99ex.ir.fig ] displays the ir spectra of sn  1999ex in the sn rest - frame .",
    "the most prominent feature in these spectra is the p - cygni profile of he i @xmath010830 which was also observed in sn  1994i .",
    "the minimum of the absorption yields an expansion velocity of 8,000 km  s@xmath4 , in good agreement with the values derived from the optical spectra . the other evident feature is the p - cygni profile due to he i @xmath020581 , with the same expansion velocity .",
    "an unidentified absorption at 9970 - 10045    can be clearly seen , which should have a rest wavelength between 10200 - 10260  .",
    "a few weak unidentified lines can be seen also in the @xmath21 band .",
    "although type ia sne display a large degree of spectroscopic homogeneity , there are several examples of sne with spectral peculiarities .",
    "different subclasses have been identified including sn  1991t - like objects , branch - normal sne , and sn  1991bg - like events @xcite .",
    "recently , the lick observatory supernova survey ( loss ) produced a sn sample with well - understood selection effects @xcite which permitted them to assess the intrinsic peculiarity rate of sne  ia @xcite .",
    "this study showed that the sample of nearby sne  ia comprises 20% , 64% , and 16% of 1991t - like , normal , and 1991bg - like objects , respectively .",
    "@xcite defined a normal sn as one with prominent features due to si ii @xmath06355 , ca ii h&k @xmath353934,3968 , as well as additional lines of s ii , o i , and mg ii around maximum light .",
    "the designation sn  1991 t in such work is not strictly correct since the prototype of the 1991 t class defined by @xcite is sn  1999aa .",
    "while sn  1999aa s main difference relative to normal sne is just a relative weakness of the si ii @xmath06355 feature before maximum that becomes almost indistinguishable from normal sne after peak ( see fig . 5 of @xcite )",
    ", sn  1991 t was a much more extreme event in the sense that the pre - maximum spectrum did not display the ca ii h&k @xmath353934,3968 blend shown by branch - normal sne , and also because it remained spectroscopically distinct several days after maximum @xcite .",
    "for the sake of clarity , in what follows we refer to the 1991t - like events of li et al . as 1999aa - like objects .",
    "the distinguishing feature of sn  1991bg - like objects is the ti ii absorption around 4100 - 4000  .",
    "there are many examples of intermediate class objects , which suggests a continuous spectral sequence among sne  ia .    because 1999aa - like events display slow - declining lightcurves ( @xmath30m@xmath38(b)@xmath391.0 ) and high peak luminosities , and 1991bg - like sne show fast - decline rates ( @xmath30m@xmath38(b)@xmath401.7 ) and low peak luminosities , it is interesting to ask if the photometric behavior can be used to predict spectroscopic peculiarities . as a slow - declining ( @xmath30m@xmath38(b)=0.94 ) and luminous ( @xmath32=-19.94 ) event observed well before maximum light , sn  1999ee provides a good opportunity to investigate whether or not all luminous sne display spectroscopic peculiarities before peak . to examine this point in detail figure [ sn99ee.opt.comp.fig ] ( top ) shows a comparison of the spectrum of sn  1999ee taken 9 days before @xmath17 maximum to that of three other sne including sn  1999aa with a decline rate of @xmath30@xmath31=0.75 @xcite , the caln / tololo sn  1992bc with @xmath30@xmath31=0.87 @xcite , and the normal sn  1990n with @xmath30@xmath31=1.07 @xcite . while sn  1999aa lacked the si ii @xmath06355 feature compared to the branch - normal sn  1990n , both sn  1992bc and sn  1999ee displayed strong and well - defined si features as early as ten days before peak .",
    "this shows that _ not all slow - decliners are spectroscopically peculiar before maximum light_. as mentioned above , 1999aa - like events show a normal spectrum at peak brightness , which can be clearly appreciated in the bottom panel of figure [ sn99ee.opt.comp.fig ] from the spectra of sn  1999aa and sn  1999ee .",
    "the fact that the spectral differences displayed by the luminous sne are only limited to the very first days of evolution suggests that the 1999aa - like and the branch - normal sne ( represented here by sn 1999ee ) are apparently similar explosions and that spectral diversity at early times probably reflects small differences in mixing or other chaotic behaviors rather than fundamental differences in the character of the explosions .",
    "there are a handful of ir spectra published for sne  ia @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently observed sn  1999by and assembled the first continuous sequence of ir spectra for a sn  ia , extending from 3 days before maximum through day + 15 after peak . to our knowledge",
    "the ir spectra of sn  1999ee  extending from day -9 to + 42  constitute the most complete ir spectroscopic sequence of a sn  ia and its branch - normal nature makes it an ideal object in which to study the homogeneity of this class of objects at these wavelengths .",
    "we proceed now to address this issue from a sample of five sne  ia encompassing a wide range in decline rates and optical spectroscopic properties .",
    "the sample comprises the branch - normal sn  1999ee , sn  1998bu @xcite , and sn  1994d @xcite , with @xmath30@xmath31=0.94,1.01,1.32 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we also include sn  1999by ( @xmath30@xmath31=1.90 ) which had optical spectra that showed resemblance to sn  1991bg @xcite , and sn  2000cx ( @xmath30@xmath31=0.93 ) which shared some of the spectroscopic peculiarities displayed by sn  1999aa - like events ( e.g. weak si ii @xmath06355 ) before maximum and a `` sui generis '' post - maximum behavior owing to unusually strong fe iii and weak fe ii lines @xcite .",
    "figure [ sn99ee.ir.comp3.fig ] ( top ) compares pre - maximum spectra of sn  2000cx , 1999ee , 1994d , and 1999by .",
    "the resemblance between the two branch - normal sne ( 1999ee and 1994d ) is remarkable .",
    "the largest , yet subtle , difference was the mg ii @xmath010926 feature which was narrower and deeper in sn  1994d .",
    "the expansion velocities derived from the absorption minimum was quite similar , @xmath310,500 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "both the si ii and si iii features near 16500    and 20000   were clearly present on both sne . with the exception of the high mg ii velocity ( @xmath320,000 km  s@xmath4 ) ,",
    "sn  2000cx showed a normal featureless spectrum .",
    "since magnesium is destroyed by oxygen burning , it is expected in material which experiences burning at the lowest densities near the surface .",
    "the high mg velocity led @xcite to conclude that nuclear burning in sn  2000cx extended farther out than in normal sne , though it is equally likely that in this supernovae a blob containing carbon burning products drifted closer to the surface than in some other sne  ia .",
    "the greater luminosity and slower decline of sn  2000cx argue for greater @xmath41ni production , and this would manifest itself also in greater excitation in the ejecta . indeed , sn  2000cx showed an emission feature at 12500   attributed to fe iii @xmath3512786,12920,13003 @xcite , which was also present in the normal sn  1999ee but at a lower strength , a weaker than normal si ii feature near 16500  , and a stronger si iii line around 20000  .",
    "sn  1999by showed a pre - maximum spectrum noticeably different than that of normal sne .",
    "the main difference was due to c i and o i lines , which were clearly absent in the spectra of other sne .",
    "@xcite suggested that nuclear burning in sn  1999by did not extend as far out as in normal sne  ia .",
    "it is possible , however , that the presence of the c i and o i lines was due to a lower excitation evidenced by the smaller @xmath41ni production , the low luminosity and fast decline of sn  1999by .",
    "the spectral differences are particularly evident in the @xmath20 band . the mg ii @xmath010926 feature was deeper than normal , although its velocity of @xmath310,000 km  s@xmath4 was similar to that observed in normal sne . in the @xmath21 band sn",
    "1999by showed a strong broad emission feature due to a blend of si ii and mg ii lines which was also present in the other sne but with a lower strength , presumably due to a weaker contribution from mg ii .",
    "the @xmath22 band spectrum is also bumpier than normal due to mg ii lines .    around maximum light the mg ii @xmath010926 feature was present in all three normal sne ( 1999ee , 1998bu , and 1994d ) with similar strengths and profiles ( bottom panel of figure [ sn99ee.ir.comp3.fig ] ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the absorption minimum of the mg ii line did not show a shift in wavelength during the pre - maximum evolution of sn  1994d , as opposed to the optical lines which all redshifted with time as the photosphere receded through the ejecta .",
    "we confirmed the absence of any significant doppler shift in mg ii from sn  1999ee which , according to @xcite was due to the fact that the photosphere had already receded below the inner edge of the magnesium layer at this early phase .",
    "it is interesting to note the absence in these spectra of the ca ii line near 11500  , a feature predicted by the models of @xcite that proves to be a useful diagnostic of the location of the transition layer between complete and incomplete silicon burning .",
    "the si ii absorption near 16500   and the spectral features in the @xmath22 band were visible in the normal sne  1999ee and 1998bu with a high degree of similarity .",
    "the pre - maximum spectral peculiarities of sn  1999by mentioned above were still evident near maximum light .",
    "figure [ sn99ee.ir.comp1.fig ] compares the post - maximum spectra available to us .",
    "two weeks after peak the two normal sne  1999ee and 1998bu displayed an impressive spectral homogeneity with strong peaks and valleys at 15000 - 17000   and 22000 - 26000   due to fe ii , co ii , ni ii , and si ii .",
    "the presence of fe ii , co ii , ni ii , and si ii is due to the ionization dropping predominantly to these ions , which happen to have strong lines in the near ir .",
    "the spectral differences of the fast - decliner sn  1999by persisted at this epoch . while its @xmath20 spectrum had contributions from ca ii lines @xcite that were absent in sne  1999ee and 1998bu , the broad emission around 15000 - 17000   was weaker than normal . at later epochs ,",
    "the spectra of sne  1999ee and 1998bu became much more complicated , yet their similarity remained remarkable .    as a result of this observational campaign we obtained the most complete optical / ir observations of a type ia sn , with an unprecedented wavelength and temporal coverage beginning nine days before maximum light .",
    "moreover , since we were able to obtain the ir spectra within one or two days from the optical spectra , it was possible to combine these observations , as shown in figure [ sn99ee.fig ] .",
    "this exercise revealed the excellent agreement between the optical and ir fluxes , a result that proved possible by synthesizing broad - band magnitudes and adjusting the flux scales according to the observed magnitudes .",
    "this optical / ir sequence shows that , while the pre - maximum optical spectrum was dominated by strong p - cygni profiles of intermediate mass elements like ca ii , si ii , mg ii , s ii , the ir was characterized by a smooth , almost featureless continuum . by maximum light , on the other hand , the ir spectrum was already dominated by broad features , and one week later the ir flux was mostly powered by emission lines of iron group elements like co ii , fe ii , and ni ii ( freshly synthesized in the innermost layers of the ejecta ) that were particularly prominent in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands . at the same time a dramatic flux dip around 12000   began to develop .",
    "previous spectroscopic observations have already revealed this @xmath20-band deficit in other sne  ia @xcite , which is responsible for the red @xmath42 color displayed by sne  ia after maximum light @xcite .",
    "this spectral sequence lends support to the suggestion by @xcite and @xcite that the `` photosphere '' recedes rapidly to the center of the supernova in the ir while at optical wavelengths the greater opacity arising from the higher spectral density of lines keeps the photosphere at higher velocities .",
    "emission at longer wavelengths increases after maximum light due to a shift in ionization to more - neutral species which have greater emissivity in the near ir . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath20-band deficit is due to the relative absence of lines ( and hence opacity ) in the 12000   region rather than increasing opacity .",
    "likewise , the secondary maxima exhibited by the @xmath29 lightcurves @xmath330 days after @xmath17 maximum @xcite are due to the increasing release of energy through lower - optical depth ir transitions .",
    "the prominent post - maximum emission features displayed by sn  1999ee in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands lend support to this picture .",
    "sne are classified according to their spectral features near maximum light @xcite .",
    "type ii sne are characterized by prominent hydrogen features and are believed to arise from the core collapse of massive ( @xmath43 8 - 10 m@xmath44 ) stars .",
    "the common feature in all type i sne is the lack of hydrogen spectral lines .",
    "the strong si ii @xmath06355 is the defining feature of sne ia .",
    "their occurrence in all type of stellar environments has led to the general consensus that the progenitors of sne  ia are white dwarfs that undergo thermonuclear disruption after a period of mass transfer from binary companions .",
    "the proximity of sne  ib and ic to massive star formation regions @xcite , on the other hand , provides evidence that these objects result from the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "the lack of hydrogen in their spectra is attributed to the loss of their outer hydrogen envelopes by stellar winds or mass transfer to binary companions .",
    "there is growing evidence for a close physical connection between sne  ii and sne  ib from the observations of sne  1987k , 1993j , and 1996cb , which evolved from sne  ii at early epochs to sne  ib at later times @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing difference between type ib and ic sne are the _ optical _ he i lines , which are conspicuous in sne ib and weak or absent in sne ic .",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether sne  ic constitute an extreme case of sne  ib or a completely separate class of objects .",
    "the apparent absence of he in the spectra of sne  ic motivated the idea that the progenitors of these objects could be nearly bare c+o cores of massive stars @xcite that loose most of their helium by binary transfer or strong stellar winds .",
    "however , @xcite showed that helium stars could be the progenitors of both sne  ib and sne  ic .",
    "they showed that the presence or absence of he i lines in the spectrum is determined primarily by the amount of mixing , not the amount of helium present ",
    "greater mixing of radioactive material increases the excitation of helium leading to stronger lines .",
    "significant effort has been put over recent years into determining the presence of helium in the spectra of sne  ic in order to better understand the nature of these objects . a detailed inspection of the spectra of the type ic sn  1994i led @xcite to conclude that weak he i lines were probably present in the optical region and that he i @xmath010830 was very prominent , although its doppler shift implied an unusually high expansion velocity @xmath316,600 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite confirmed these observations and found evidence that he i @xmath05876 was also present in sn  1994i with a blueshift of @xmath317,800 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "they also reported high velocity he i @xmath05876 in the spectra of the three best - observed type ic sne ( 1983v , 1987 m , and 1988l ) , which led them to conclude that most , and probably all , sne  ic show evidence for optical he i lines .",
    "this conclusion , however , was recently questioned by @xcite and @xcite by means of spectral synthesis models which showed that the ir feature near 10250   could be accounted with lines of c i and si i. moreover , @xcite argued that the feature attributed to he i @xmath05876 in the spectrum of sn  1994i could be a blend of other species .",
    "evidently , there is no consensus yet about the presence or absence of he in the spectra of sne  ic .",
    "recently @xcite compiled and analyzed a large collection of spectra of sne  ib and ic .",
    "this study showed no compelling evidence for he in the spectra of sne  ic and no gradual transition from the ib to the ic class , which supported the idea that these objects are produced by different progenitors .",
    "our optical spectra of sn  1999ex show evidence for he i absorptions of moderate strength in the optical region , thus suggesting the existence of an intermediate ib / c case . to illustrate this point in figures [ sn99ex.opt.comp1.fig ] and [ sn99ex.opt.comp2.fig ] we show a comparison between sn  1999ex , the best - observed type ic sn  1994i , and the prototypes of the ib ( sn  1984l ) and ic class ( sn  1987 m ) .",
    "the near - maximum spectra ( top panel of figure [ sn99ex.opt.comp1.fig ] ) reveal a gradual increase in the strength of all he lines ( indicated with tick marks ) from the ic to the ib class . in the bottom panel of figure [ sn99ex.opt.comp1.fig ] ( one week past maximum )",
    "it is possible to see that , even though the spectra of the type ic sne  1994i and 1987 m are quite similar , sn  1994i shows deeper troughs at the wavelengths of the he i lines , especially at 4471 , 4921 , and 5876  .",
    "the spectrum of sn  1994i obtained two weeks past maximum ( figure [ sn99ex.opt.comp2.fig ] ) is particularly interesting as it provides good evidence that the he i @xmath05876 line was indeed present in the spectrum of sn  1994i with a higher expansion velocity than the na i d @xmath05893 doublet .",
    "this was also noted by @xcite who quoted an expansion velocity of @xmath316,600 km  s@xmath4 for the he line ( see also @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "overall , figures [ sn99ex.opt.comp1.fig]-[sn99ex.opt.comp2.fig ] reveal that there is a smooth spectroscopic sequence ranging from the he deficient type ic sne  1987 m and 1994i , the type ib / c sn  1999ex , and the type ib sn  1984l that is characterized by strong optical he lines .",
    "we conclude therefore that sn  1999ex provides first evidence for a link between the ib and ic classes and that there is a continuous sequence of sne ib and ic objects .",
    "special attention must be paid to the ir feature near 11,000   which was very prominent in sne  1999ex and 1994i . as mentioned above the definitive identity of this feature in sn  1994i",
    "is still uncertain : it could be accounted with lines of c i and si i @xcite or with high velocity he i @xmath010830 @xcite . if the feature in sn  1999ex was he i @xmath010830 it would imply a moderate velocity of 6,000 - 8,000 km  s@xmath4 , which matches very well the velocities derived from the fe , na and si lines .",
    "the presence of the he i @xmath020581 with the same expansion velocity ( see figure [ sn99ex.ir.fig ] ) suggests that the ir feature in sn  1999ex was indeed due to he i @xmath010830 . altogether",
    "our ir spectra of sn  1999ex provide unambiguous proof that he was present in the atmosphere of this intermediate ib / c object .",
    "a detailed atmosphere model could be very useful at placing limits on the he mass in the ejecta of sn  1999ex and constraining the nature of its progenitor . as suggested by @xcite the presence of highly blueshifted he i",
    "@xmath05876 in sn  1994i suggests that the ir feature was also due to he i @xmath010830 .",
    "if so , the difference in he velocities between sne  1994i and 1999ex might prove an interesting clue to the underlying physics of the atmospheres of this class of objects .",
    "further optical / ir spectroscopy and photometry will lead us to better understanding the atmospheres of sne  ib and ic .",
    "finally , given that the ir spectra were obtained within one day from the optical spectra , we were able to combine these observations .",
    "figure [ sn99ex.fig ] shows the resulting spectra and the excellent agreement between the optical and ir fluxes .",
    "note the prominent he i @xmath0@xmath010830,20581 features .",
    "in the course of the soirs program we obtained high - quality spectroscopy of the type ii sn  1999em @xcite . figure [ allsne.fig ] compares maximum - light spectra of the type ii sn  1999em , the type ib / c sn  1999ex , and the type ia sn  1999ee .",
    "this figure permits one to compare the different characters of the main classes of sne , all the way from 3,000 to 25,000  .",
    "the type ii is distinguished by prominent hydrogen balmer and paschen lines .",
    "it also shows the p - cygni profile of the he i @xmath010830 transition .",
    "the type ib / c is characterized by the strong he i @xmath3510830,20581 lines in the ir , the he i @xmath05876 line in the optical , and other lines in the optical due to singly ionized ca , fe , mg , si and neutral na and o. it is interesting to note that , while both the type ii and the type ib / c show strong he i @xmath010830 , only the type ib / c shows a significant he i @xmath020581 feature .",
    "finally , the type ia at the bottom of this figure is characterized by the strong si ii @xmath06355 and other intermediate - mass elements , and the absence of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the observations obtained for sn  1999ee constitute the most complete spectral and temporal coverage ever achieved for a sn ia .",
    "its branch - normal character makes it an ideal reference for comparative studies of sne  ia .    before maximum light",
    "sn  1999ee displayed a normal spectrum with a strong si ii @xmath06355 absorption , thus showing that not all slow - declining sne are spectroscopically peculiar at these evolutionary phases .",
    "we conclude that the photometric properties of luminous sne  ia can not be used to predict spectroscopic peculiarities .    from a comparison of the ir spectra of sn  1999ee and other sne  ia that encompass a wide range in decline rates we find that there is a remarkable homogeneity among the branch - normal sne ia during their first 60 days of evolution .",
    "although the slow - decliner luminous sn  2000cx showed a premaximum featureless ir spectrum similar to that of normal sne , the mg ii @xmath45 line was characterized by a high expansion velocity . the fast - decliner subluminous sn  1999by was noticeably different than the other sne at all epochs .",
    "this study reveals that the spectroscopic peculiarities displayed by sn  1991bg - like objects at optical wavelengths are also present in the ir .    the fortunate occurrence of sn  1999ex within three weeks and in the same galaxy that hosted sn  1999ee permitted us to obtain optical and ir spectroscopy of a ib / c event .",
    "sn  1999ex was characterized for the lack of hydrogen lines , weak optical he i lines , and strong he i @xmath010830,20581 , thus providing an example of an intermediate case between pure ib and ic sne .",
    "we conclude therefore that sn  1999ex provides first clear evidence for a link between the ib and ic classes and that there is a continuous spectroscopic sequence ranging from the he deficient sne  ic to the sne  ib which are characterized by strong optical he i lines .",

    "<S> we report optical and infrared spectroscopic observations of the type ia sn  1999ee and the type ib / c sn  1999ex , both of which were hosted by the galaxy ic  5179 . for sn  1999ee </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a continuous sequence with an unprecedented wavelength and temporal coverage beginning 9 days before maximum light and extending through day 42 . before maximum light </S>",
    "<S> sn  1999ee displayed a normal spectrum with a strong si ii @xmath06355 absorption , thus showing that not all slow - declining sne are spectroscopically peculiar at these evolutionary phases . a comparative study of the infrared spectra of sn  1999ee and other type ia supernovae shows that there is a remarkable homogeneity among the branch - normal sne ia during their first 60 days of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> sn  1991bg - like objects , on the other hand , display spectroscopic peculiarities at ir wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> sn  1999ex was characterized by the lack of hydrogen lines , weak optical he i lines , and strong he i @xmath0@xmath010830,20581 , thus providing an example of an intermediate case between pure ib and ic supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude therefore that sn  1999ex provides first clear evidence for a link between the ib and ic classes and that there is a continuous spectroscopic sequence ranging from the he deficient sne  ic to the sne  ib which are characterized by strong optical he i lines . </S>"
