    "networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators with balanced gains and losses have been considered recently in the context of nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric lattices . among many other questions ,",
    "attention has been paid to issues of linear and nonlinear stability of constant equilibrium states @xcite and spatially distributed steady states @xcite in such systems .",
    "more generally , the study of solitary waves in such @xmath0-symmetric lattices  @xcite has garnered considerable attention over the years , as can be inferred also from a recent comprehensive review on the subject  @xcite .",
    "a significant recent boost to the relevant interest has been offered by the experimental observation of optical solitons in lattice settings  @xcite .",
    "many of the relevant theoretical notions have been developed also in continuum systems with periodic potentials in both scalar  @xcite and vector  @xcite settings .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "the number of studies of @xmath0-symmetric lattices and the coherent structures that they support is considerably more limited .",
    "nonlinear states bifurcating out of linear ( point spectrum ) modes of a potential and their stability have been studied  @xcite and so have gap solitons  @xcite . however , an understanding of fundamentally topological states such as vortices and their existence and stability properties is still an active theme of study .",
    "the few studies addressing these topological structures have been chiefly numerical in nature  @xcite .",
    "it is , thus , the aim of the present study to explore a two - dimensional square lattice setting and to provide an understanding of the existence and stability properties of the stationary states it can support , placing a particular emphasis on the vortical structures",
    ".    we will be particularly interested in the following @xmath0-symmetric model of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) type  @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 depends on the lattice site @xmath3 and the time variable @xmath4 ( in optics , this corresponds to the spatial propagation direction ) , @xmath5 denotes the discrete laplacian operator at the @xmath6-th site of the square lattice , and the distribution of the parameter values @xmath7 for gains or losses is supposed to be @xmath0-symmetric .",
    "the dnls equation is a prototypical model for the study of optical waveguide arrays  @xcite , and the principal setting in which @xmath0-symmetry was first developed experimentally ( in the context of few waveguides , such as the dimer setting  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetry holds if the distribution of @xmath8 is odd with respect to reflections of the lattice sites in @xmath9 about a selected center or line of symmetry .",
    "in particular , we will consider two natural symmetric configurations shown in figure [ vortex1 ] .",
    "the left panel shows the symmetry about a vertical line located on the equal distance between two vertical arrays of lattice sites .",
    "the right panel shows the symmetry about a center point in the elementary cell of the square lattice .    [",

    "in the present work , we have provided a systematic perspective on discrete soliton and vortex configurations in the two - dimensional square lattices bearing @xmath0-symmetry . both the existence and the stability features of the @xmath0-symmetric stationary states were elucidated in the vicinity of a suitable anti - continuum limit , which corresponds to the large propagation constant in optics .",
    "interestingly , while discrete vortex solutions were identified and a suitable family thereof could be continued as a function of the gain - loss parameter @xmath10 , it was never possible to stabilize the @xmath0-symmetric vortex configurations .",
    "on the other hand , although states extending discrete soliton configurations were found generally to be also unstable , we found one exception of generically stable ( including under continuation ) states .",
    "this work paves the way for numerous additional explorations .",
    "for instance , it may be relevant to extend the considerations of the square lattice to those of hexagonal or honeycomb lattices .",
    "prototypical configurations in the @xmath0-symmetric settings has been explored in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the @xmath0-symmetric states may manifest unexpected stability features , e.g. , higher charge vortices are more robust than the lower charge ones  @xcite .",
    "another relevant possibility is to extend the present consideration to a dimer lattice model , similarly to what was considered e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "the numerical considerations of  @xcite suggest that vortices may be stable in suitable parametric intervals in such a setting .",
    "lastly , it may be of interest to extend the present considerations also to three - dimensional settings , generalizing analysis of the corresponding hamiltonian model of  @xcite ( including cubes and diamonds ) and exploring their stability properties .    * acknowledgments : * p.g.k .  gratefully acknowledges the support of nsf - dms-1312856 , as well as the erc under fp7 , marie curie actions , people , international research staff exchange scheme ( irses-605096 ) . the work of d.p .",
