    "in this article , we propose a new approach for the synthesis of low - dimensional suboptimal controllers for optimal control problems of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) of parabolic type .",
    "optimal control of pdes has been extensively studied in the past few decades due largely to its broad applications in both engineering and various scientific disciplines , and fruitful results have been obtained ; see _ e.g. _ the monographs @xcite .    due to the complexity of most applications , optimal control problems of parabolic pdes",
    "are often solved numerically . among the commonly used methods one finds methods that solve at once the associated optimality system using techniques such as the newton or quasi - newton methods @xcite , or methods that use optimization algorithms involving for instance an approximation to the gradient of the cost functional ;",
    "see _ e.g. _ @xcite . in this case , the gradient can be approximated by using sensitivity methods or methods based on the adjoint equation ; see _ e.g._@xcite .",
    "efficient ( and accurate ) solutions can be designed by such methods @xcite which may lead however to high - dimensional problems that can turn out to be computationally expensive to solve , especially for fluid flows applications .",
    "the task becomes even more challenging when a dynamic programming approach is adopted , involving typically to solve ( infinite - dimensional ) hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations @xcite .    as an alternative ,",
    "various reduction techniques have been proposed in the literature to seek instead for low - dimensional suboptimal controllers .",
    "the main issue related to such techniques relies however on the ability to design suboptimal solutions close enough to the genuine optimal one @xcite , while keeping cheap enough the numerical efforts to do so .",
    "a general class of model reduction techniques used extensively in this context is the so - called reduced - order modeling ( rom ) approach , based on approximating the nonlinear dynamics by a galerkin technique relying on basis functions , possibly empirical @xcite .",
    "various rom techniques differ in the choice of the basis functions .",
    "one popular method that falls into this category is the so - called proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) ; see among many others @xcite , and @xcite for other methods in constructing the reduced basis .",
    "we refer also to @xcite for suboptimal controllers designed from the solutions of low - dimensional hjb equations associated with pod - based galerkin reduced - order models .",
    "such galerkin / rom - based techniques can lead to a synthesis of very efficient suboptimal controllers once , at a given truncation , the disregarded high - modes do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of the low modes .",
    "however , when this is not the case , the seeking of parameterizations of the disregarded modes in terms of the low ones becomes central for the design of surrogate low - dimensional models of good performances .",
    "the idea of seeking for slaving relationships between the unstable or least stable modes with the more stable ones has a long tradition in control theory of large - dimensional or distributed - parameter systems .",
    "for instance , by use of methods from singular perturbation theory , the authors in @xcite investigated the construction of such slaving functions for slow - fast systems in terms of invariant ( slow ) manifolds .",
    "such manifolds are then used to decouple the slow and fast parts of the dynamics and to feed back the slow component of the state only .",
    "this is especially important since the fast components of the state are in general difficult to measure / estimate and consequently to feedback .",
    "complementary to singular perturbation methods , the authors of @xcite used tools of center manifold and normal form theory to design a nonlinear controller and obtained a closed - loop center manifold for a truncated distributed - parameter system ; in their case proximity to a bifurcation constitutes a guarantee to the separation of relevant time scales of the problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have gone beyond the finite - dimensional singular perturbation work of @xcite or center - manifold - based work of @xcite to exploit approximate inertial manifolds ( aims ) @xcite in the infinite - dimensional case ; the latter are global manifolds in phase space that can be thought of as generalizations of slow / center manifolds . using aims , the authors of @xcite designed then observer - based nonlinear feedback controllers ( through the corresponding closed - loop aims ) and demonstrated their performance .",
    "the potential usefulness of inertial manifolds ( ims ) @xcite or aims in control theory of nonlinear parabolic pdes was actually quickly identified after i m theory started to be established @xcite ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite for a state - of - the - art of the literature at the end of the @xmath3s .",
    "however since these works , ims or aims have been mainly employed to derive low - dimensional vector fields for the design of feedback controllers @xcite . to the exception of @xcite , the use of ims or aims to design suboptimal solutions to optimal control problems have been much less considered .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to introduce a general framework in the continuity but different from the aim approach for the effective derivation of _ suboptimal low - dimensional _ solutions to optimal control problems associated with nonlinear pde such as given below .",
    "to be more specific , given an ambient hilbert space , @xmath4 , the control problems of pdes we will consider hereafter take the following abstract form : @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 denotes a linear operator ,",
    "@xmath7 some nonlinearity , and @xmath8 denotes a _ bounded linear operator _ on @xmath4 ; the state variable @xmath9 and the controller @xmath10 living both in @xmath11 for a given horizon @xmath12 ; see section [ sect_functfram ] for more details .",
    "the underlying idea consists of seeking for manifolds @xmath13 aimed to provide over a finite horizon @xmath0 $ ] an _ approximate parameterization _ of the small scales of the solutions to the _ uncontrolled pde _ associated with eq .  ,",
    "namely @xmath14 in terms of their _ large scales _ , so that @xmath13 allows in turn to derive low - dimensional reduced models from which suboptimal controllers can be efficiently designed by standard methods of finite - dimensional optimal control theory such as found in _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in that respect , the notion of _ finite - horizon parameterizing manifold _ ( pm ) is introduced in definition [ def : pm ] below .",
    "finite - horizon pms distinguish from the more classical aims in the sense that they provide approximate parametrization of the small scales by the large ones in the @xmath15-sense ( over @xmath0 $ ] ) rather than a hard @xmath16-approximation to be valid for each time @xmath17 $ ] , cf . @xcite . in particular , a finite - horizon pm allows to reduce the ( cumulative ) unexplained high - mode energy ( over @xmath0 $ ] ) from the low modes to be controlled , in a way different from other slaving relationships considered so far ; the high - mode energy being reduced in a _",
    "mean - square sense _ in the case of finite - horizon pms .",
    "obviously , the difficulty relies still on the ability of such an approach to give access to suboptimal controllers of good performance .",
    "a priori the task in not easy and a key feature to ensure that a `` good '' performance is achieved from such a suboptimal low - dimensional controller , @xmath18 , relies on the ability of the manifold @xmath13 derived from the uncontrolled problem to still achieve a sufficiently `` small '' _ parameterization defect _",
    "( over the horizon @xmath0 $ ] ) of the small scales by the large ones once a controller @xmath18 is used to drive the pde ; see in definition [ def : pm ] .",
    "this point is rigorously formulated as theorem [ thm_controller ] in section [ sect_reduced model ] ( see also corollary [ cor_2 ] ) , which provides under a second - order sufficient optimality condition error estimates on how `` close '' a low - dimensional suboptimal controller @xmath1 , designed from a pm - based reduced system , is to the optimal controller @xmath2 .",
    "the error estimates and show in particular that the closeness of @xmath1 to @xmath2 is mainly conditioned on two factors : ( i ) the parameterization defect of a given pm , associated respectively with the suboptimal controller @xmath1 and the optimal controller @xmath2 ; and ( ii ) the energy kept in the high modes of the pde solution either driven by @xmath1 or @xmath2 itself .",
    "the article is organized as follows . the functional framework associated with optimal control problems related to",
    "is introduced in section  [ sect_functfram ] .",
    "the definition of finite - horizon pms and a practical procedure to get access to such pms are introduced in section  [ sect_pm ] . in particular analytic formulas of leading - order pms",
    "are provided ; the latter being subject to a cross _ non - resonance condition _ to be satisfied between the high and the low modes ; see section [ ss : h1 ] .",
    "section  [ sect_reduced model ] is devoted , given an arbitrary pm , to the derivation of rigorous _ a priori _ error estimates between a low - dimensional pm - based suboptimal controller and the optimal one ; see theorem [ thm_controller ] and corollary [ cor_2 ] .",
    "the performance of the resulting pm - based reduction approach is numerically investigated on a burgers - type equation in the context of globally and locally distributed control laws ; see sections  [ sect_burgers][sect_burgers_h2 ] , and section  [ sect_burgers_local ] . as a main byproduct ,",
    "the numerical results strongly indicate that a pm - based reduced system allows for a design of suboptimal controllers with good performances provided that the aforementioned parameterization defects and the energy contained in the high modes are small enough , in agreement with the theoretical predictions of theorem [ thm_controller ] and corollary [ cor_2 ] .",
    "this is particularly demonstrated in section [ sect_burgers_h2 ] , where analytic formulas derived in theorem [ thm_h2 ] give access to higher - order pms with reduced parameterization defects compared to those of the leading - order pms introduced in section [ sect_pm ] .",
    "in all the cases , the analytic formulas of the pms used hereafter allows for an efficient design of suboptimal controllers by standard ( and simple ) application of the pontryagin maximum principle @xcite to the pm - based reduced systems .",
    "the functional framework for the optimal control problem considered in this article takes place in hilbert spaces .",
    "let us first introduce the class of partial differential equations ( pdes ) to be controlled .",

    "<S> these estimates demonstrate that the closeness of @xmath1 to @xmath2 is mainly conditioned on two factors : ( i ) the parameterization defect of a given pm , associated respectively with the suboptimal controller @xmath1 and the optimal controller @xmath2 ; and ( ii ) the energy kept in the high modes of the pde solution either driven by @xmath1 or @xmath2 itself .    </S>",
    "<S> the practical performances of such pm - based suboptimal controllers are numerically assessed for optimal control problems associated with a burgers - type equation ; the locally as well as globally distributed cases being both considered . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results show that a pm - based reduced system allows for the design of suboptimal controllers with good performances provided that the associated parameterization defects and energy kept in the high modes are small enough , in agreement with the rigorous results . </S>"
