    "various species of knotted polymers have been synthesized and observed in chemistry and biology in the last two decades . @xcite",
    "once a ring polymer is formed , its topological state is unique and invariant",
    ". the topological constraint on the ring polymer should be nontrivial .",
    "it may restrict the available degrees of freedom in the configuration space of the polymer , to a great extent .",
    "consequently , it may lead to a large entropic reduction , which is related to the probability of random knotting , as wee shall see shortly .    for a knot @xmath0",
    ", we define the knotting probability @xmath3 by the probability that the topology of a random polygon with @xmath4 nodes is given by the knot @xmath0 .",
    "if a ring polymer is under the topological constraint of the knot @xmath0 , then the decrease of the polymer entropy is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is the ratio of the volume of the configuration space under the topological constraint to that of no topological constraint .",
    "the knotting probability @xmath3 should also correspond to the probability that a ring polymer of @xmath4 kuhn units have the knot @xmath0 when it is closed randomly during its synthesis .",
    "the knotting probabilities have been measured as the fractions of knotted species of circular dnas .",
    "@xcite    let us now discuss how to express the complexity of knots .",
    "we could classify knots completely , if we might know all the topological properties that are invariant under any continuous deformation of the spatial configurations .",
    "the topology of a given polygon can be effectively detected by calculating some topological invariants such as the alexander polynomial @xmath6 and the vassiliev - type invariants @xmath7 . although the invariants are practically useful for computer simulations @xcite , it is not easy to derive any explicit topological properties or meanings from them .",
    "let us consider the minimal number of crossing points in the knot diagram of a knot @xmath0 .",
    "we donate it by @xmath1 , or @xmath8 for the knot @xmath0 .",
    "the minimal crossing number @xmath1 should be a measure on the complexity of knots .",
    "the number @xmath1 is useful in studying statistical or dynamical properties of knotted ring polymers @xcite .",
    "there is some arguments on the mean - square radius of gyration of knotted ring polymers with respect to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath1 is rather weak as a topological invariant .",
    "the number of knots that have the same number @xmath1 increases rapidly : there are 166 primes knots which have 10 crossings .",
    "recently the concept of ideal knots has attracted much interest .",
    "one of the most ideal ( or elegant ) geometric representations of a knot should be given by such a closed tube with uniform diameter that gives the largest ratio of the diameter to the tube length .",
    "we call such geometric representations _ ideal knots _ , briefly . for a ring polymer with a knot type @xmath0 ,",
    "grosberg @xmath9 @xcite discussed a topological invariant @xmath2 of a knot @xmath0 , which is defined by the aspect ratio of the length ( @xmath10 ) to the diameter ( @xmath11 ) of such a ring polymer of knot @xmath0 that is maximally inflated , _",
    "i.e. _ , an ideal knot . here , @xmath2 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "we also denote it by @xmath13 . the value @xmath13 should be a measure of knot complexity",
    ". it may be more powerful than @xmath1 , since different knots should have different values of @xmath2 , in general .",
    "al _ have obtained ideal knots for 42 different knots @xcite .",
    "there is a linear relation between the average crossing numbers of ideal knots and their @xmath2 values .",
    "the value @xmath2 should be also useful for describing flexible dna knots in thermal equilibrium @xcite . furthermore , the value @xmath2 should be useful for statistical or dynamical researches of knotted ring polymers .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath4-dependence of the knotting probability has been studied through simulations , @xcite and it is found that the probability of the unknot ( the trivial knot ) decreases exponentially with respect to @xmath4 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fitting parameters .",
    "for some nontrivial knots ( @xmath17 ) , knotting probabilities have been evaluated numerically for several different models of random polygons and self - avoiding polygons .",
    "@xcite . through the simulations using the vassiliev - type invariants",
    ", it is found that the probability @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath18 here @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fitting parameters to be determined from the numerical results .",
    "the expressions ( [ knot0 ] ) and ( [ knot - formula ] ) should correspond to the asymptotic expansion of renormalization group arguments .",
    "numerically we see that the estimates of @xmath20 should be given by almost the same value for any knot @xmath0 @xcite , and therefore the @xmath20 s are almost equal to @xmath16 , which depends on the model .",
    "we also observe that the value @xmath21 of a knot @xmath0 should be universal for the different models @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how the knotting probability @xmath3 of a knot @xmath0 should depend on its complexity while @xmath4 being fixed , or in short , the knot dependence of the normalization constant @xmath19 . evaluating the knotting probabilities of several prime knots for gaussian random polygons , we observe a rough tendency that the amplitude @xmath19 decreases exponentially with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the numerical result seems to be favorable to grosberg s conjecture @xcite that the probability @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 should be given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a constant . at this stage , however , we could not judge whether the conjecture be valid , since the data points scatter outside the range of statistical errors .",
    "on the other hand , we show another explicit statistical behavior for a version of the knotting probability .",
    "let us define the average knotting probability @xmath24 by @xmath25 here the sum is over such knots that have the same minimal crossing number @xmath1 , and @xmath26 denotes the number of prime knots which have the same minimal crossing number @xmath1 . for instance",
    ", we have @xmath27=1 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "then , we shall see from the data that the average knotting probability decreases exponentially with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , if we consider the average of the @xmath2 s over such knots that have the same @xmath1 @xmath30 then we see that the average knotting probability also decays exponentially with respect to the average @xmath31 .",
    "using the conditional probability @xcite , we construct a large number of gaussian random polygons , say @xmath32 polygons , of @xmath4 nodes for @xmath4 = 300 , 500 and 1000 . then , the knotting probability of a knot @xmath0 is evaluated by @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the number of polygons with the knot @xmath0 , and @xmath32 is given by @xmath35 to each of the three numbers of @xmath4 .    in order to detect the knot type of a give polygon ,",
    "we employ three knot invariants : the determinant @xmath36 of a knot @xmath0 , the vassiliev - type invariants @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the second and third degrees , respectively .",
    "we evaluate @xmath34 , after enumerating the number of the polygons which have the same set of the values of the three invariants for the knot @xmath0 . using @xmath38",
    ", we do not distinguish the chirality of the knot , _",
    "i.e. _ , the right - handed knots and the left - handed ones @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we do not consider six knots ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) in any of the simulations in the paper .",
    "they have the same values of the three invariants as those of some composite knots .",
    "the estimates of the average knotting probability @xmath24 are plotted in fig .",
    "1 against the minimal crossing number @xmath1 , up to @xmath45 . it is clear in fig .",
    "1 that the average knotting probability @xmath24 decreases exponentially with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "we remark that error bars correspond to one standard deviation in all the four figures in the paper .",
    "let us now discuss the knotting probability in terms of the @xmath2 values . in fig .",
    "2 , the knotting probabilities @xmath3 for some prime knots are plotted against @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is kept constant .",
    "we note that the @xmath2 values of the 42 knots are listed in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are used in the paper .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "2 that there is a rough tendency that the knotting probability of a prime knot decrease exponentially with respect to the value @xmath2 . the observation should be useful .",
    "however , it seems that there is no clear relation between the knotting probability @xmath3 and the aspect ratio @xmath2 , since the data points of larger @xmath2 values deviate from the possible regression line , considerably .",
    "here we recall that error bars correspond to one standard deviation .",
    "let us discuss the knotting probability for such knots that have the same minimal crossing number .",
    "for instance , there are two knots with 5 minimal crossings : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for gaussian polygons ,",
    "the knotting probability of @xmath47 is always larger than that of @xmath46 .",
    "this is consistent with the simulation of the cylindrical self - avoiding polygons @xcite .",
    "let us consider the three prime knots with @xmath48 .",
    "we observe that the knotting probabilities of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are almost the same , while that of @xmath51 is always smaller than the other two . for prime knots with @xmath52 7 or 8 ,",
    "the data points are so close to each other that it is difficult to give any definite ranking on them .    in terms of the average value @xmath31 , which is a function of @xmath1 , the estimates of the average knotting probability @xmath53",
    "are expressed in fig .",
    "we clearly see the exponential decay of the average knotting probability @xmath53 with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "it is similar to fig .",
    "this result shows that the entropy of a ring polymer with knot @xmath0 decreases with respect to knot complexity expressed in terms of @xmath31 or @xmath1 .",
    "here it is also suggested that @xmath31 should be approximately linear to @xmath1 .",
    "let us discuss the @xmath4-dependence of the knotting probability in terms of knot complexity .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 of a knot @xmath0 against the value @xmath2 is plotted in fig .",
    "4 for the three numbers of @xmath4 : @xmath55 . here",
    "we note that the trefoil knot ( @xmath56 ) is dominant among the nontrivial prime knots for the three @xmath4 s .",
    "we find again the rough tendency that the ratio @xmath54 decays exponentially with respect to knot complexity @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , for any knot @xmath0 , the ratio @xmath54 is given by almost the same value for the three numbers of @xmath4 , with respect to error bars as seen in fig .",
    "the ratios @xmath54 are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "the above observation in fig .",
    "4 can be explained by using the fitting formula ( [ knot - formula ] ) .",
    "let us assume that for a prime knot @xmath0 , the exponent @xmath21 of eq .",
    "( [ knot - formula ] ) should be given by almost the same value .",
    "then , we have @xmath57 , which is clearly independent of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in terms of the formula ( [ knot - formula ] ) , the rough exponential decay of the knotting probability with respect to @xmath2 is closely related to the knot complexity - dependence of the amplitude @xmath19 ."
