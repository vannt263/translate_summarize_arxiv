    "<S> once more the israel s equation for the motion of the soliton surface separating the two metrics was obtained @xmath153 where @xmath154 , @xmath44 is the scale factor . in order to study the dynamics of the soliton surface we identified the motion of the domain wall with the motion of a unit mass particle with vanishing total energy moving under the influence of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the potential function @xmath155 is presented on fig.6 . </S>",
    "<S> closer analysis of this function reveals that once again if we introduce the friction the whole system behaves just like in the de sitter case . </S>",
    "<S> one can notice the similarity with the results obtained in the previous paragraph concerning the analysis of the function @xmath122 . however , this time the critical trajectory reaches the schwarzschild horizon @xmath156 . </S>",
