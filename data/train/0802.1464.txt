    "the field of quantum computing faces two main tasks : to build a large - scale quantum computer , and to figure out what it can do once it exists . in general",
    "the first task is best left to ( experimental ) physicists and engineers , but there is one crucial aspect where theorists play an important role , and that is in analyzing the level of noise that a quantum computer can tolerate before breaking down .    the physical systems in which qubits may be implemented are typically tiny and fragile ( electrons , photons and the like ) .",
    "this raises the following paradox : on the one hand we want to isolate these systems from their environment as much as possible , in order to avoid the noise caused by unwanted interaction with the environment  so - called `` decoherence '' .",
    "but on the other hand we need to manipulate these qubits very precisely in order to carry out computational operations .",
    "a certain level of noise and errors from the environment is therefore unavoidable in any implementation , and in order to be able to compute one would have to use techniques of error correction and fault tolerance .    unfortunately , the techniques that are used in classical error correction and fault tolerance do not work directly in the quantum case .",
    "moreover , extending these techniques to the quantum world seems at first sight to be nearly impossible due to the continuum of possible quantum states and error patterns . indeed , when the first important quantum algorithms were discovered  , many dismissed the whole model of quantum computing as a pipe dream , because it was expected that decoherence would quickly destroy the necessary quantum properties of superposition and entanglement .",
    "it thus came as a great surprise when , in the mid-1990s , _ quantum error correcting codes _ were developed by shor and steane  @xcite , and these ideas later led to the development of schemes for _ fault - tolerant quantum computing _  .",
    "such schemes take any quantum algorithm designed for an ideal noiseless quantum computer , and turn it into an implementation that is robust against noise , as long as the amount of noise is below a certain threshold , known as the _ fault - tolerant threshold_. the overhead introduced by the fault - tolerant schemes is typically quite modest ( a polylogarithmic factor in the total running time of the algorithm ) .    the existence of fault - tolerant schemes turns the problem of building a quantum computer into a hard but possible - in - principle engineering problem : if we just manage to store our qubits and operate upon them with a level of noise below the fault - tolerant threshold , then we can perform arbitrarily long quantum computations .",
    "the actual _ value _ of the fault - tolerant threshold is far from determined , but will have a crucial influence on the future of the area  the more noise a quantum computer can tolerate in theory , the more likely it is to be realized in practice .",
    "the first fault - tolerant schemes were only able to tolerate noise on the order of @xmath6 , which is way below the level of accuracy that experimentalists can hope to achieve in the foreseeable future .",
    "these initial schemes have been substantially improved in the past decade . in particular ,",
    "knill has recently developed various schemes which , according to numerical calculations , seem to be able to tolerate more than 1%  noise  @xcite .",
    "if we insist on provable constructions , the best known threshold is on the order of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "constructions of fault - tolerant schemes provide a _ lower bound _ on the fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "a very interesting question , which is the topic of the current paper , is whether one can prove _ upper bounds _ on the fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "such bounds give an indication on how far away we are from finding optimal fault - tolerant schemes .",
    "they can also give hints as to how one should go about constructing improved fault - tolerant schemes .",
    "such upper bounds are statements of the form  any quantum computation performed with noise level higher than @xmath1 is essentially useless \" , where  essentially useless \" is usually some strong indication that interesting quantum computations are impossible in such a model .",
    "for instance , buhrman et al .",
    "@xcite quantify this by giving a classical simulation of such noisy quantum computation , and razborov  @xcite shows that if the computation is too long , the output of the circuit is essentially independent of its input .",
    "the best known upper bounds on the threshold are @xmath8 by razborov  @xcite and @xmath9 by buhrman et al .",
    "( these bounds are incomparable because they work in different models ; see the end of this section for more accurate statements . )",
    "as one can see , there are still about two orders of magnitude between our best upper and lower bounds on the fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "this leaves experimentalists in the dark as to the level of accuracy they should try to achieve in their experiments . in this paper , we somewhat reduce this gap .",
    "so far , much more work has been spent on lower bounds than on upper bounds",
    ". our approach will be the less - trodden road from above , hoping to bring new techniques to bear on this problem .",
    "[ [ our - model . ] ] our model .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + +    in order to state our results , we need to describe our circuit model .",
    "we consider parallel circuits , composed of @xmath10 _ wires _ and @xmath11 _ levels _ of gates ( see figure [ fig : circuit ] ) .",
    "we sometimes use the term _ time _ to refer to one of the @xmath12 `` vertical cuts '' between the levels . for convenience , we assume that the number of qubits @xmath10 does not change during the computation",
    ". each level is described by a partition of the qubits , as well as a gate assigned to each set in the partition .",
    "notice that at each level , all qubits must go through some gate ( possibly the identity ) .",
    "notice also that for each gate the number of input qubits is the same as the number of output qubits .",
    "we assume the circuit is composed of @xmath0-qubit gates that are probabilistic mixtures of unitary operations , as well as arbitrary ( i.e. , all completely - positive trace - preserving ) one - qubit gates .",
    "we assume the output of the circuit is the outcome of a measurement of a designated output qubit in the computational basis .",
    "finally , we assume that the circuit is subject to noise as follows .",
    "recall that @xmath1-depolarizing noise on a certain qubit replaces that qubit by the completely mixed state with probability @xmath1 , and does not alter the qubit otherwise .",
    "formally , this is described by the superoperator @xmath13 acting on a qubit @xmath14 as @xmath15 we assume that each one - qubit gate is followed by at least @xmath16-depolarizing noise on its output qubit , where @xmath17 is an arbitrarily small constant .",
    "thus one - qubit gates can be essentially noise - free .",
    "we also assume that each @xmath0-qubit gate is preceded by at least @xmath18-depolarizing noise on each of its input qubits , where @xmath19 .",

    "then for any two states @xmath14 and @xmath20 , the probabilities of obtaining measurement outcome @xmath21 at the output qubit starting from @xmath14 and starting from @xmath20 , respectively , differ by at most @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , for any @xmath23 , the probability of measuring @xmath21 at the output qubit of a circuit running for @xmath24 levels is ( up to @xmath25 ) independent of the input .",

    "is the case @xmath3 , for which our bound becomes about @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , for the case in which the only allowed two - qubit gate is the cnot gate , we can improve our bound further to about @xmath5 , as we show in section  [ seccnot ] .",
    "this case is interesting both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "note also that the cnot gate together with all one - qubit gates forms a universal set  @xcite .    [",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    here we comment on the significance of our results and of our model .",
    "first , it is known that fault - tolerant quantum computation is impossible ( for any positive noise level ) without a source of fresh qubits .",
    "our model takes care of this by allowing arbitrary one - qubit gates  in particular , this includes gates that take any input , and output a fixed one - qubit state , for instance the classical state @xmath27 .",
    "this justifies our assumption that the number of qubits in the circuit remains the same throughout the computation : all qubits can be present from the start ,",
    "since we can reset them to whatever we want whenever needed .",
    "second , our assumption that all @xmath0-qubit gates are mixtures of unitaries does slightly restrict generality .",
    "not every completely - positive trace - preserving map can be written as a mixture of unitaries . however , we believe that it is a reasonable assumption .",
    "as one indication of this , to the best of our knowledge , all known fault - tolerant constructions can be implemented using such gates ( in addition to arbitrary one - qubit gates ) . moreover , all known quantum algorithms gain their speed - up over classical algorithms by using only unitary gates .",
    "a slightly more severe restriction is the assumption that the output consists of just one qubit .",
    "however , we believe that in many instances this is still a reasonable assumption . for instance , this is the case whenever the circuit is required to solve a decision problem . moreover , our results can be easily extended to deal with the case in which a small number of qubits are used as an output .    by allowing essentially noise - free one - qubit gates , our model addresses the fact that gates on more than one qubit are generally much harder to implement .",
    "it should also be noted that the exact value of the constant @xmath28 is inessential and can be chosen arbitrarily small , as this just affects the constant in the @xmath29 of theorem  [ the : main ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath30 is only necessary because otherwise it would be possible to let @xmath31 and @xmath32 , do nothing for @xmath11 levels ( i.e. , apply noise - free one - qubit identity gates on all wires ) and then measure the first qubit .",
    "the resulting difference between output probabilities is then @xmath21 .",
    "instead of assuming an @xmath17 amount of noise , we could alternatively deal with this issue by requiring that every path from the input to the output qubit goes through enough @xmath0-qubit gates .",
    "our proof can be easily adapted to this case .",
    "note that since our theorem applies to arbitrary starting states , it in particular applies to the case that the initial state is encoded in some good quantum error - correcting code , or that it is some sort of  magic state \"  @xcite . in all these cases",
    ", our theorem shows that the computation becomes essentially independent of the input after sufficiently many levels .    finally , it is interesting to note that our bound on the threshold behaves like @xmath33 .",
    "this matches what is known for classical circuits  @xcite , and therefore probably represents the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "previous bounds only achieved an asymptotic behavior of @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "[ [ techniques . ] ] techniques .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    we believe that a main part of our contribution is introducing a new technique for obtaining upper bounds on the fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "namely , we use a pauli basis decomposition in order to track the state of the computation .",
    "we believe this framework will be useful also for further analysis of quantum fault - tolerance .",
    "a finer analysis of the pauli coefficients might improve the bounds we achieve here , and possibly obtain bounds that are tailored to other computational models .",
    "[ [ related - work . ] ] related work .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    the work most closely related to ours is that of razborov  @xcite .",
    "there , he proves an upper bound of @xmath35 on the fault - tolerant threshold . on one hand ,",
    "his result is stronger than ours as it allows arbitrary @xmath0-qubit gates and not just mixtures of unitaries .",
    "razborov also has a second result , namely the trace distance between the two states obtained by applying the circuit to starting states @xmath14 and @xmath20 , respectively , goes down as @xmath36 with the number of levels @xmath11 .",
    "hence even the results of an arbitrary @xmath10-qubit measurement on the full final state become essentially independent of the initial state after @xmath37 levels . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of our bound is better for all values of @xmath0 , and we also allow essentially noise - free one - qubit gates . hence the two results are incomparable . razborov s proof is based on tracking how the trace distance evolves during the computation .",
    "our proof is similar in flavor , but instead of working with the trace distance , we work with the frobenius distance ( since it can be easily expressed in terms of the pauli decomposition ) .",
    "buhrman et al .",
    "@xcite show that classical circuits can efficiently simulate any quantum circuit that consists of perfect , noise - free _ stabilizer operations _ ( meaning clifford gates ( hadamard , phase gate , cnot ) , preparations of states in the computational basis , and measurements in the computational basis ) and arbitrary one - qubit unitary gates that are followed by @xmath9 depolarizing noise . hence such circuits are not significantly more powerful than classical circuits .- bound of  @xcite",
