    "one of the best examples of the existence of solitary waves in plasma includes electrostatic solitary waves ( esws ) in the broadband electrostatic noise ( ben ) observed by different satellites(e.g . ,",
    "polar@xcite , geotail @xcite , fast @xcite , and cluster @xcite ) in various regions of the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "ion - acoustic solitary waves ( iasws ) , the main solitary waves in plasma physics , exist in the simplest form of multi - species plasmas ; i.e. hot electrons and cold ions .",

    "they appear as a hole or hump in the phase space .",
    "schamel @xcite has included the effect of trapped electrons , and showed that it introduces its own nonlinearity term in kdv equation ( hence modified kdv ) .",
    "this nonlinearity depends on the number of trapped electrons ( parametrized by @xmath0 called trapping parameter ) . by comparing this trapping nonlinearity with the usual nonlinearity , three different iasws are possible , including the normal solitary waves ; i.e. kdv solutions .",

    "hence it can generally be assumed that any nonlinear structure will break into solitary waves given enough time .",
