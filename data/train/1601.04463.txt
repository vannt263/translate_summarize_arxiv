    "one may invoke the smoothness of the function by averaging @xmath184 over nearby frequencies in a suitable window of width @xmath185 . since the spacing between accessible frequencies is @xmath186 , relative error of the window - averaged @xmath187 should decrease as @xmath188 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath185 should not be chosen too large to cause significant information loss .",

    "a large window is desirable so as to reduce statistical error in the original data .",
    "we now illustrate the above general ideas with an explicit example , the harmonic potential switching model .",

    "<S> our work suggests that energy loss in inefficient motors may be caused by fast switching of the chemical states that produces nonequilibrium fluctuations in the rotary motion . </S>",
