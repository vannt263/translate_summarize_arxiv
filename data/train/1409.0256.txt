    "the equilibrium magnetization field in ferromagnetic nanodots and in chiral magnets , often possesses a nontrivial topology .",
    "magnetic vortices in permalloy@xcite and skyrmion lattices in transition metal compounds@xcite were experimentally observed .",
    "these configurations are interesting because a change between states having different topologies ( switching of the vortex core , motions and annihilation of skyrmions ) , can be used as basic states in non - volatile memories and spintronic devices.@xcite a generic physical mechanism that can trigger these topological changes , without magnetic fields , is the spin - transfer torque.@xcite it consists of the interaction between itinerant spins , produced by a spin - polarized current , and magnetic moments ( fixed spins ) of the magnetic material , when the underlying magnetization is non - uniform .    from a more general point of view , physical systems involving defects or topological singularities are among the more rich and interesting to investigate ; the difficulty to consistently deal with these singularities resides in the coupling of a large range of scales relevant to describe their structure and dynamics .",
    "for instance , in the domain of magnetic textures in nanoscale systems , the switching of a magnetic vortex entails the nucleation of a bloch point , which is a magnetization field singularity.@xcite the characteristic length , time and energy scales involved in the formation of the bloch point range from the crystal lattice , where the dominant effect is the neighboring spins exchange interaction , to the intermediate micromagnetic structures , and up to the geometry of the ferromagnet through the dipolar magnetic field.@xcite a similar difficulty appears in the transition from a skyrmion state towards a ferromagnetic state in chiral magnets , driven by a localized electric current pulse , where spin - orbit together with exchange couplings are present.@xcite    the dynamics of magnetic vortices is usually studied in the micromagnetic approximation , based on the landau - lifshitz equation.@xcite within this framework , to account for the spin - transfer torque one has to extend the landau - lifshitz equation with terms proportional to the current and the magnetization gradients.@xcite however , this approach neglects strong non - adiabatic effects , such as the generation of current inhomogeneities due to the scattering of electrons on the magnetization gradients . in order to investigate topological changes in ferromagnets , we recently proposed a self - consistent model , where electrons obey quantum dynamics ( see ref .   and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we develop this model further , focusing on the skyrmion - ferromagnetic transition induced by a spin polarized current .",
    "we are in particular interested in the relationship between topological change and dynamics . in analogy with the collapse of langmuir solitons@xcite we ask whether a finite time singularity would arise in the evolution of a driven localized magnetic structure .",
    "the basic magnetic texture we consider , is a stabilized version of the belavin - polyakov@xcite skyrmion , appropriated to a system defined on a periodic lattice . after a presentation of the basic equations coupling the schrdinger equation for the itinerant spins ( electrons ) to the landau - lifshitz equation for the ferromagnetic spins ( fixed classical magnetic moments ) , defined on a square lattice , we present a qualitative model to show the basic mechanism of the transition .",
    "the transition from the skyrmion state to the ferromagnetic state implies a change in topology , and thus a violation of the topological charge conservation .",
    "we include an exchange dissipation term,@xcite that in principle can smooth the transition .",
    "we performed a series of numerical computations to study the phenomenology of the transition and to identify the mechanism of the topological change , and their dependence on the dissipation .",
    "the main result of this paper , is the description of the topological change as a finite - time singularity in the dynamics of the skyrmion ( in the continuum limit ) .",
    "a self - similar solution of the landau - lifshitz equation driven by the spin - torque term is found and compared to the texture observed in simulations .",
    "the motion of an electron in a lattice of step @xmath0 and size @xmath1 is given by the heisenberg equation for the two components ( for the spin - up and spin - down ) annihilation operator @xmath2 at site @xmath3 , @xmath4\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the time dependent hamiltonian , @xmath6 where the fixed @xmath7 and itinerant spins @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the vector of pauli matrices ) are coupled by the exchange constant @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the energy to jump from site @xmath12 to its neighbor @xmath13 .",

    "the last term @xmath25 , includes a dissipation mechanism to be specified below .",
    "this equation is coupled to the equation for the electrons through the torque in @xmath10 , where the electron spin is computed by the formula @xmath26 where the bracket is for the quantum mean value .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in order to have a well defined topology . note that @xmath27 is a difference operator acting on the lattice sites . in practice ,",
    "the difference operators are computed in fourier space and transformed to the lattice space . in units",
    "such that @xmath28 , typical parameters are as follows : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . with these parameters ,",
    "the order of magnitude of physical units are as follows : length @xmath34 , time @xmath35 ( the magnetization characteristic time is @xmath36 ) , energy @xmath37 , electric field @xmath38 .    without the dissipation term , the system ( [ e : c]-[e : hs ] )",

    "topological changes , such as the transition between a skyrmion state and a ferromagnetic state , or the switch of vortex polarity , need , in the continuum limit , a transition state where the core magnetization vanishes at some point ; this is impossible in the framework of the landau - lifshitz equation , which strictly conserves the norm of @xmath45 . for instance , in the intermediate state of a three dimensional vortex switching , a bloch point is nucleated.@xcite the inclusion of a dissipation mechanism relevant in the low temperature and strong magnetization gradients limit , is essential to allow a regularization of the dynamics . a simple phenomenological theory , allows for deriving a general form of an exchange driven dissipation term.@xcite the rate of dissipation of the total magnetic energy , taken as a functional of the magnetic moments distribution @xmath46 $ ] , is as follows , @xmath47 where we used ( [ e : fi ] ) ; the integration is on the system s volume ( in units of the lattice cell size ) . the dissipation vector can be expanded , as in the linear response theory , in the gradients of the effective field @xmath48 . in the simplest isotropic case , and taking into account that the corresponding term must appear as a divergence in the energy balance equation , the most general form is : @xmath49 with @xmath50 as a positive nondimensional constant .",
    "this choice gives @xmath51 .",
    "dissipation effects not depending on gradients are already included in the terms proportional to @xmath24 in ( [ e : ll ] ) .",
    "the vector ( [ e : dis ] ) describes the energy dissipation related to exchange interactions , and thus involving neighboring magnetic moments : @xmath52 , is analogous to a curvature dissipation term .",
    "it breaks the conservation of the magnetization norm .",
    "we performed numerical computations based on the integration of the coupled equations ( [ e : c ] ) and ( [ e : ll ] ) to investigate the transition between an initial nontrivial topological state and a final uniform magnetization state , driven by an electron current initially uniformly polarized .",
    "we use a full spectral model on the lattice to compute the spatial spin texture of electrons and classical spins .",
    "time stepping of the schrdinger equation for the electron quantum state @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electron initial state , use a splitting method that exactly conserves the norm of the quantum state .",
    "the initial distribution of the magnetization is computed using a relaxation method to find a local equilibrium solution of the landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "we start with a belavin - polyakov skyrmion of topological charge @xmath55 : @xmath56 of size @xmath57 , with the central core pointing in the @xmath58-down direction , and with magnetization in the up direction at infinity ( fig .",
    "[ f : skyr ] left panel ) .",
    "this continuous and extending to infinity magnetization field , relaxes towards a periodic distribution defined on the square lattice .",
    "however , at scales @xmath59 intermediate between the lattice and the spatial period lengths , @xmath60 , it is similar to the continuous distribution , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : skyr ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is chosen to satisfy this requirement .",
    "the skyrmion is driven by an electron current , which is taken to be initially uniform , polarized in the up direction , parallel to the fixed spins orientation far from the core region .",
    "the numerical computations show an initial transient characterized by the deformation of the skyrmion core and the generation of spin waves if the electric field is strong enough . after this transient , a quasi - stationary state sets in .",
    "one observes a smooth precession motion of the fixed spins , and depending on the intensity of the current , a displacement of the skyrmion core .",
    "the topological charge is not affected by the transient or the subsequent regular dynamics of the magnetic texture . during the evolution of the skyrmion , its core size decreases .",
    "the reduction of the core dramatically accelerates at some given time , at which a transition to other state with different topology occurs . in fig .",
    "[ f : tt ] we show snapshots of the skyrmion core region during the topological change .",
    "the scenario of the transition between the skyrmion and the ferromagnetic states , can be influenced by the dissipation .",
    "the first effect of the dissipation is to break the invariance of the topological charge , which is no longer restricted to take integer values .",
    "we observe in particular that the exchange dissipation term favorises the transition from the skyrmion state to the ferromagnetic state . indeed , we plot in fig .",
    "[ f : q ] the evolution of the topological charge as a function of the dissipation strength .",
    "in addition to the increasing instability of the skyrmion state with increasing dissipation , it is worth noting that the characteristic transition time becomes longer with dissipation .",
    "this is , as expected , a regularization effect . in the limit of vanishing dissipation the transition produces , ultimately , by the change of a single spin.@xcite    a quantitative explanation , from the topological point of view , of the mechanism behind the transition",
    "is based on the behavior of the electron spins .",
    "we discuss in the following section , the dynamical point of view of the transition . as we can observe in fig .",
    "[ f : b ] , although the electrons dynamics is almost stochastic ( due to multiple scattering and interference effects ) , their spins organize near the skyrmion core .",
    "this can be verified by measuring the topological @xmath62-field , defined in a similar way as the density @xmath42 of topological charge , but substituting @xmath63 to @xmath45 : @xmath64 represented in fig .",
    "[ f : b ] by the color density .",
    "we verify that the transition is associated with the nucleation of a well localized electron vortex having a topological charge density opposite to the one of the background skyrmion ( the white spots that appear near the skyrmion core at times @xmath65 , for the three values of the dissipation , respectively ) .",
    "we remark , that despite the dissipation , the characteristic length scale of these structures is comparable with a few lattice steps , confirming their topological nature ( as defects in the elastic field of a crystal ) . these structures , highly fluctuating in the low dissipation limit , tend to stabilize at high dissipation .",
    "in particular , the white spot of localized @xmath62-field , appearing at @xmath66 in the case @xmath67 of fig .",
    "[ f : b ] ( right panel ) , is always present at @xmath68 , before fading out .",
    "the behavior of the electron spin field is similar in the intermediate dissipation case of @xmath69 , but on a much shorter time scale . in the three cases we observe a strong spin field parallel to the plane in the neighborhood of the skyrmion center forming a vortex like structure .",
    "these observations naturally lead to a scenario in which the topological change is related to the interaction of the skyrmion core spins with this topological field .",
    "in such a case , the topological change can be accounted for as a balance equation : @xmath70 the final charge results from the addition of the skyrmion charge and the electron spin structure charge .",
    "this supposes that the fixed spins are at the transition time , looked to the electron spins dynamics ( the opposite of the adiabatic assumption ) .",
    "the interaction should result then in the annihilation of the skyrmion topological charge by the nucleation of an electron structure of opposite charge , accomplishing in this way , the transition towards a topologically different state . in what follows , we attempt to relate this topological change to the dynamics of the magnetization under the action of the electron itinerant spins .",
    "to study the dynamics of the skyrmion - ferromagnetic transition it is convenient to work in the dissipationless continuous limit , and to transform the magnetization field ( which has only two independent components ) using the stereographic projection : @xmath71 with @xmath72 when @xmath73 , @xmath74 goes to zero , and in the opposite pole , @xmath75 , @xmath74 goes to infinity .",
    "this projection maps the vector field over the unit sphere @xmath76 to the field over the complex plane @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 ) .",
    "the landau - lifshitz equation ( [ e : ll ] ) with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , becomes , @xmath81 ( only the exchange field in @xmath23 , is considered here ) where we defined the complex derivative @xmath82 and its complex conjugate @xmath83 .",
    "the second line in ( [ e : wt ] ) corresponds to the spin - transfer torque term , where @xmath84 .",
    "the exchange energy and the topological charge , in the stereographic representation , are given by , @xmath85 equilibrium solutions of ( [ e : wt ] ) are arbitrary analytic functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the simplest one is the simple zero , @xmath88 , the belavin - polyakov skyrmion of energy @xmath89 and charge @xmath90 , centered at the origin and of characteristic size @xmath91 ( spin up at the origin and spin down at infinity ) .",
    "it is worth noting that if @xmath74 is a solution of ( [ e : wt ] ) , due to the special properties of the stereographic transformation , @xmath92 is also a solution with @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is a solution with @xmath95 , provided that and an identical change is made for the itinerant spins components .    in order to investigate how the spin torque perturbs the skyrmion state @xmath96 , we focus on two simple limiting cases : first , small deviations from the skyrmion state by a uniform polarized current @xmath97 ; and second , a small circular region around the skyrmion core relevant to track the transition towards the ferromagnetic state @xmath98 .    in the first case",
    ", we linearize ( [ e : wt ] ) around the skyrmion state , @xmath99 : @xmath100 and the spin torque appears as a source term in this approximation . an interesting particular solution is readily found : @xmath101 the pure imaginary factor has the effect of changing the orientation of the magnetization field around the center of the skyrmion , passing successively in time from left to right chirality ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : skyr ] ) . a sequence observed in the numerical simulations , in addition to the fact that the effective size of the core reduces : @xmath102 ( even if , for long times , the perturbation analysis ceases its validity ) .",
    "we turn now to the second case , for which we assume that the collapse of the skyrmion core can be described , in the limit of large @xmath103 , by eq .",
    "( [ e : wt ] ) in the form , @xmath104 where , in polar coordinates , @xmath105 and the stereographic function is given by @xmath106 , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we assume that this equation is valid in the neighborhood of the skyrmion core . as the change of topology is ,",
    "as revealed by the numerical computations , a local processes , studying the behavior of the magnetization in the core region should be enough to exhibit its essential features .",
    "in addition , the sudden change in the topology suggests that the main physical mechanism should be the disappearance of the characteristic length scale associated with the skyrmion core size , and therefore , a self - similar evolution in a finite time .    in the asymptotic limit of very large @xmath103",
    ", we search for a solution to ( [ e : wt1 ] ) , appropriated to account for the skyrmion collapse , in a self - similar form:@xcite @xmath109 which describes the approach of @xmath74 to infinity , when @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the collapse time . at @xmath112",
    "the characteristic size of the skyrmion vanishes . inserting the ansatz ( [ e : ansatz ] ) into ( [ e : wt1 ] ) one obtains two conditions which determine the unknown exponents : @xmath113 it is worth noting that the exchange interaction , which is scale invariant , does not permit selecting the @xmath24 exponent ; its value is fixed by the coupling term with the spin polarized current .",
    "a crude estimation of the finite time singularity , which depends in particular on the initial condition , is @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the typical itinerant spin strength per site ( which is in the range of @xmath116 for our numerical parameters ) .",

    "near the singularity , the self - similar variable @xmath123 , the last nonlinear term can be neglected [ its main contribution is to the prefactor in ( [ e : ansatz ] ) , allowing a balance between the time derivative and the nonlinear driving force ] .",
    "the solution of ( [ e : f ] ) can hence be written as @xmath124 where @xmath125 satisfies the equation , @xmath126 ^ 2 +       \\frac{\\partial_x f(x)}{x } + \\frac{f(x)}{x^2 } = 0\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the fact that this equation is invariant under scale transformations , suggests the substitution @xmath127 with @xmath128 as an arbitrary complex constant .",
    "this substitution enables us to integrate ( [ e : fx ] ) once , @xmath129 the solution of ( [ e : g ] ) can be found in terms of the meijer functions , @xmath130:@xcite @xmath131 where an integration constant was chosen to be zero , in order to ensure the correct behavior near @xmath132 .    setting ( [ e : solg ] ) into ( [ e : subs1 ] ) , and using ( [ e : ansatz ] ) , and ( [ e : subs0 ] ) , we finally obtain the self - similar solution of the driven landau - lifshitz equation in the stereographic projection representation ( [ e : wt ] ) : @xmath133 a fit of ( [ e : solw ] ) , useful to get some feeling on the structure of this function , can be obtained using the asymptotics of @xmath134 .",
    "these asymptotics can easily be derived from the differential equation ( [ e : g ] ) for small and large @xmath135 .",
    "near the origin @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 , and at infinity @xmath138 , the solution approaches @xmath139 , leading to the expression , @xmath140 [ with a redefinition of the global constant , including a dimensional dependence on @xmath23 , @xmath141 .",
    "this form allows seeing that , at a fixed time , near the origin the solution match a skyrmion @xmath142 , with @xmath143 therefore , the size of the skyrmion core vanishes as a power law in time with exponent @xmath144 .            the exact self - similar solution ( [ e : solw ] ) is represented in fig .",
    "[ f : ss ] , for @xmath145 and @xmath146 . changing the phase of the constant @xmath128 , changes the tilt of the magnetization .",
    "the similarity with the numerical computed shape is remarkable . indeed , for a simple skyrmion form @xmath147 , with @xmath148 ( as the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ f : skyr ] ) , the graph of @xmath45 significantly differs with the shape resulting from a position dependent phase .",
    "in fact , the form @xmath149 , allows for distinct amplitudes of the @xmath150 and @xmath151 components , breaking the symmetry they possess in the simple skyrmion .",
    "in addition , the self - similar form ( [ e : ansatz ] ) preserves the stationarity of the exchange energy ( [ e : excq ] ) and topological charge ( a scale transformation shows that the integrals are independent of time ) ; in particular , the topological charge of the solution ( [ e : solwa ] ) is @xmath90 ( as in the initial state ) .",
    "this is not mandatory for the validity of the calculation , as the explicit solution was deduced assuming a locality condition .",
    "the asymptotic evolution depends essentially on the behavior near the singular point ( where the exchange interaction is stronger ) , whereas the topological charge is a global property of the magnetization field",
    ". however , it is in accordance with the approximation consisting of keeping only the leading term in a multipole expansion @xmath152 , with @xmath153 .",
    "after the experimental evidence of skyrmion phases in chiral magnets,@xcite phases that can reach the atomic scale,@xcite it was soon realized that spin - torques are efficient in driven skyrmion dynamics at relatively low current densities.@xcite in addition to the spin - transfer torque mechanism , other skyrmion generation mechanisms are possible , for instance , in ferrimagnetic thin films , photo - irradiation leads to a variety of topological configurations that can be controlled by tuning the laser fluence.@xcite discontinuities in the magnetization can also be important.@xcite a domain wall driven by a current can be converted into a skyrmion when entering a wider region,@xcite an interesting effect in view of its possible application to magnetic memories . a property common to these generation mechanisms of non - trivial magnetic configurations ,",
    "is the presence of strong inhomogeneities.@xcite in our simulations these strong inhomogeneities are spontaneously created by the interaction of the electrons and the magnetization texture .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the electron interference and scattering in the potential of fixed spins .",
    "in fact , the electron current acts as a random torque on the ( classical ) magnetic texture .",
    "it might be important to emphasize that the landau - lifshitz equation coupled with the schrdinger equation results in a effective stochastic dynamics of the magnetization .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f : fig6 ] the signal of the spin - transfer torque computed at the skyrmion core position .",
    "the highly intermittent dynamics of the torque intensity ( defined as its absolute value ) corresponds to a poisson processes , as verified by its histogram .",
    "although other sources of stochasticity can be introduced , for example to take into account thermal effects , it is important to isolate the contribution of the conduction electrons .",

    "the main goal was to identify the physical mechanism of the topological change and its relation with the dynamics of the skyrmion core .",
    "we numerically showed that the torque exerted by the itinerant spins modifies the distribution of the magnetization around the skyrmion core , and tends initially to reduce its size and ultimately drives a topological change .",
    "this topological change strongly depends on the dissipation strength . in the absence of dissipation",
    "the collapse time explicitly depends on the lattice cutoff . at variance , in the case where dissipation is effective , the transition tends to regularize , and the lifetime of the skyrmion state reduces with increasing dissipation .",
    "however , the microscopic mechanism of topological change is in the dissipative case , similar to the nondissipative one ( even if the time and length scales may differ ) .",
    "it is related to the appearance of a peculiar electronic structure possessing a net charge opposite to the one in the skyrmion .",
    "the synchronization of the fixed spins with this electron vortical structure , leads to the annihilation of the topological charge , which passes from its initial value @xmath55 ( skyrmion state ) to zero ( homogeneous ferromagnetic state ) .    using the stereographic projection to represent the landau - lifshitz equation in the complex plane",
    ", we could analyze the dynamics of the transition .",
    "the polarized current induces a precession of the skyrmion core and tends to reduce its size , as shown by a linear perturbation calculation . when the system is dominated by the exchange interaction and the polarized current , in the strongly nonlinear regime we found that the magnetization follows a self - similar evolution .",
    "the self - similar characteristic exponents , which govern the dependence in time of the core size , are determined by the electron spin driving terms .",
    "the structure of the self - similar core is essentially determined by the exchange gradients . applying these approximations",
    ", we solved the asymptotic dynamics and obtained a collapse of the core in a finite time .",
    "the explicit shape of the self - similar solution compares well with the numerically computed one . in conclusion",
