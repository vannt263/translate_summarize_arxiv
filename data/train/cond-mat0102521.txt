    "phase ordering dynamics describes the way in which domains of an ordered state develop when an initially disordered system is placed in an environment which promotes ordering . for instance , when a simple ferromagnet or alloy is quenched rapidly from very high to very low temperatures @xmath14 , domains of equilibrium low-@xmath14 ordered phases form and grow to macroscopic sizes .",
    "a quantitative description of the ordering process is provided by the time development of the two - point correlation function ; asymptotically , it is a function only of the separation scaled by a length which increases with time , typically as a power law @xcite .",
    "new phenomena and effects can arise when we deal with phase ordering in systems which are approaching _ nonequilibrium _ steady states . in this paper , we study a coupled - field nonequilibrium system in which one field evolves autonomously and influences the dynamics of the other .",
    "the system shows phase ordering of a new sort , whose principal characteristic is that fluctuations are very strong and do not damp down in the thermodynamic limit  hence the term fluctuation - dominated phase ordering ( fdpo ) .    in usual phase ordering systems such as ferromagnetic ising model ,",
    "if one considers a finite system and waits for infinite time , then the system reaches a state with magnetization per site very close to the two possible values of the spontaneous magnetization , @xmath15 or @xmath16 , with very infrequent transitions between the two .",
    "this is reflected in a probability distribution for the order parameter which is sharply peaked at these two values , with the width of the peaks approaching zero in the thermodynamic limit ( fig . [ fdpo](a ) ) .",
    "by contrast , in the fdpo steady state , the system continually shows strong fluctuations in time without , however , losing macroscopic order .",
    "accordingly , the order parameter shows strong variations in time , reflected eventually in a probability distribution which remains broad even in the thermodynamic limit ( fig . [ fdpo](b ) ) .",
    "the physical system we study consists of an independently stochastically fluctuating surface of zero average slope , on which reside particles which tend to slide downwards guided by the local slopes of the surface .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , a state with uniform particle density is unstable towards large scale clustering under the action of surface fluctuations .",
    "eventually it is driven to a phase - ordered state with macroscopic inhomogeneities of the density , of the fdpo sort .",
    "besides exhibiting a broad order parameter distribution , this state shows unusual scaling of two - point correlation functions and cluster distributions .",
    "it turns out that much of the physics of this type of ordering is also captured by a simpler model involving a coarse - grained characterization of the surface alone , and we study this as well .",
    "a brief account of some of our results has appeared in @xcite .    in the remainder of the introduction ,",
    "we first discuss the characteristics of fdpo _ vis a vis _ normal phase - ordered states .",
    "we then discuss , in a qualitative way , the occurrence of fdpo in the surface - driven models under study .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ fdpo_cd ] , we define and study the coarsening and steady states of three different coarse - grained depth models of the fluctuating surfaces . in section [ understandfdpo ]",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of a power - law in the cluster size distribution , and show how it can give rise to fdpo . in section [ fdpo_sp ] ,",
    "we discuss ordering of sliding particles on fluctuating surfaces . in section [ robust ] , we explore the robustness of fdpo with respect to changes in various rates defining the nonequilibrium process .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we summarize our principal results , and discuss the possible occurrence of fdpo in models of other physical systems .      with the aim of bringing out the features of fluctuation dominated phase ordering ( fdpo ) in nonequilibrium systems ,",
    "let us recall some familiar facts about phase ordered states in equilibrium statistical systems .",
    "we first discuss different characterizations of spontaneous ordering , following the paper of griffiths @xcite on the magnetization of idealized ferromagnets .",
    "we follow this with a discussion of fluctuations about the ordered state .      *",

    ", the thermal average of the absolute value m_1= lim_l |m|  ( nonconserved ) [ defm1 ] with boltzmann - gibbs weights for configurations provides an unequivocal measure of the order .",
    "this is because in the low - temperature ordered phase , the probability @xmath22 of occurrence of magnetization @xmath17 is peaked at @xmath23 and @xmath16 ; the peak widths approach zero in the thermodynamic limit @xmath24 , so that the average value @xmath25 coincides with the peak value @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fdpo]@xmath26 ) .    for the conserved order parameter case ,",
    "the value of the magnetization is a constant and is same in both the disordered and ordered phase .",
    "one therefore needs a quantity that is sensitive to the difference between order and disorder .",
    "the simplest such quantity is the lowest nonzero fourier mode of the density @xcite |q| = 1 l|_n e^2i n / l(1+s_n)2| [ defq*1 ] where @xmath27 denotes the average magnetization in the @xmath28-dimensional plane @xmath21 oriented perpendicular to the @xmath29 direction .",

    "[ porodr ] is easy to understand in systems where phases are separated by sharp boundaries on the scale of the system size , as in * ( c ) * above : a spatial averaging of @xmath53 produces @xmath54 with probability @xmath55 ( within a phase ) and @xmath56 with probability @xmath50 ( across phases ) .",
    "the linear drop with @xmath50 implies that the structure factor @xmath57 , which is the fourier transform of @xmath38 , is given , for large wave - vectors @xmath58 ) , by : ~1 ^d+1 .",
    "[ porod ] this form of the decay of the structure factor for scalar order parameters is known as the porod law .",
    "it is worth remarking that the forms eqs .",

    "in such a case , @xmath18 denotes the coarsening time - dependent length scale which is the characteristic size of an ordered domain .    *",
    "( e ) * for usual phase - ordered systems , spatial fluctuations are negligible in the limit of the system size going to infinity . hence the averages of 1-point and 2-point functions over an ensemble of configurations are well represented by a spatial average for a single configuration in a large system .",
    "the phase ordering of interest in this paper occurs in certain types of nonequilibrium systems , and the resulting steady state differs qualitatively from the ordered state of equilibrium systems and other types of nonequilibrium systems considered earlier @xcite .",
    "the primary difference lies in the effects of fluctuations .",
    "customarily , fluctuations lead to large variations of the order parameter which scale sublinearly with the volume , and so are negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "fluctuation effects are much stronger here , and lead to variations of the order parameter in time , without , however , losing the fact of ordering .",
    "below we discuss how the properties * ( a)-(e ) * discussed above are modified .    *",
    "( a ) * nonzero values of the averages @xmath59 and @xmath31 ( eqs . [ defm1 ] and [ defq * ] ) continue to indicate the existence of order , but no longer provide an unequivocal measure of the order parameter .",

    "* the measure @xmath62 of long - range order is nonzero , and its value can be found from the intercept @xmath63 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath39 is , in general , quite different from @xmath25 .    * ( c ) * as with usual ordered states , the regions of pure phases are of the order of system size @xmath18 .",
    "but in contrast to the usual situation , there need not be a well - defined interfacial region , distinct from either phase . rather , the region between the two largest phase stretches is typically a finite fraction of the system size , and has a lot of structure ; this region itself contains stretches of pure phases separated by further such regions , and the pattern repeats .",
    "representative spin configurations @xmath64 for the two cases are depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ cusp1 ] .",
    "this nested structure is consistent with a power - law distribution of cluster sizes , and thus of a critical state .",
    "the crucial extra feature of the fdpo state is that the largest clusters occupy a finite fraction of the total volume , and it is this which leads to a finite value of @xmath39 as in ( b ) above .",
    "representative spin configurations @xmath64 for the two cases are depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ cusp1 ] .    *",
    "( d ) * the ensemble - averaged spatial correlation function @xmath38 continues to show a scaling form in @xmath50 .",

    "[ scale ] this implies that the scaled structure factor varies as ~1 ^d+ [ cusp ] with @xmath65 .",
    "this represents a marked deviation from the porod law ( eq . [ porod ] ) .",
    "we will demonstrate in some cases that this deviation is related to the power - law distribution of clusters in the interfacial region separating the domains of pure phases , as discussed in * ( c ) * above .",
    "* ( e ) * the spatial average of 1-point functions ( @xmath17 or @xmath66 ) and the 2-point function @xmath44 as a function of @xmath50 in a single configuration of a large system typically do not represent the answers obtained by averaging over an ensemble of configurations .",
    "this reflects the occurrence of macroscopic fluctuations .",
    "having described the general nature of fluctuation - dominated phase ordering , we now discuss the model systems that we have studied and which show fdpo .",
    "we consider physical processes defined on a fluctuating surface with zero average slope .",
    "the surface is assumed to have no overhangs , and so is characterized by a single - valued local height variable @xmath67 at position @xmath29 at time @xmath68 as shown in fig .",
    "the evolution of the height profile is taken to be governed by a stochastic equation .",
    "the height - height correlation function has a scaling form @xcite for large separations of space and time : ^2~|x - x|^2f(|t - t| |x - x|^z ) .",
    "[ hhcorr ] here @xmath69 is a scaling function , and @xmath70 and @xmath2 are the roughness and dynamical exponents , respectively . a common value of these exponents and scaling function for several different models of surface fluctuations indicate a common universality class for such models . in this paper",
    "we will study one - dimensional surfaces belonging to three such universality classes of surface growth .",
    "similar studies of two - dimensional surfaces @xcite show that similar fluctuation - dominated phase - ordered states arise in these cases as well .    before turning to the physical model of particles sliding on such fluctuating surfaces ,",
    "we address the notion of phase ordering in coarse - grained depth models associated with these surface fluctuations . in fig .",
    "[ sur1 ] we show the function @xmath71 which take values @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 depending on whether the height is below , above or at the same level as some reference height @xmath75 .",

    ", the surface gets rougher up to some length scale @xmath78 .",
    "the profile has hills and valleys , the base lengths of which are of the order of @xmath78 , implying domains of like - valued @xmath79 whose size is of the same order .",
    "once the steady state is reached , there are landscape arrangements of the order of the system size @xmath18 which occur on a time scale @xmath80 .",
    "however , these landscape fluctuations do not destroy long - range order , but cause large fluctuations in its value .",
    "now let us turn to the problem of hard - core particles sliding locally downwards under gravity on these fluctuating surfaces .",
    "figure [ par1 ] depicts the evolution of particles falling to the valley bottoms under gravity .",
    "when a local valley forms in a region ( fig .",
    "3(a ) @xmath81 fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , particles in that region tend to fall in and cluster together .",
    "the point is that particles stay together even when there is a small reverse fluctuation ( valley @xmath82 hill as in fig .",
    "[ par1](b ) @xmath82 ( c ) ) ; declustering occurs only if there is a rearrangement on length scales larger than the size of the valley .",
    "the combination of random surface fluctuations and the external force due to gravity drive the system towards large - scale clustering .",
    "results of our numerical studies show that in the coarsening regime , the typical scale of ordering in the particle - hole system is comparable to the length scale over which surface rearrangements take place .",
    "further , the steady state of the particle system exhibits uncommonly large fluctuations , reflecting the existence of similar fluctuations in the underlying coarse - grained depth models of the hill - valley profile .",
    "similar effects are seen in 1-point and 2-point correlation functions .",

    "the aim is to have a coarse - grained construction of locations of large valleys and hills .",
    "our procedure depends on the choice of the reference level , and we have explored three choices ( the cd1 , cd2 and cd3 models ) which are discussed below .    in model cd1 , the reference level is set by the initial condition , which corresponds to an initially flat interface : @xmath115 .",

    "we find that the downward gravitational force combined with local surface fluctuations lead to large scale clustering of the hard - core particles .",

    "thus the moves @xmath255 and @xmath256 occur at rate @xmath257 , while the inverse moves occur with rate @xmath258 .",

    "the rate of update of the particles is same as that of the surface .",
    "the problem can be specified at a coarse - grained mesoscopic level by the continuum equations for the density field @xmath268 corresponding to the discrete variable @xmath269 for the particles . since the particle density is conserved , the starting point is the continuity equation @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the local current . under the hydrodynamic assumption ,",
    "the systematic part of the above current is @xmath272 , since for viscous dynamics , the speed is proportional to the local field , in this case the local gradient of height .",
    "moreover there is a diffusive part @xmath273 which is driven by local density inhomogeneities , and a noisy part @xmath274 which arises from the stochasticity .",
    "the noise @xmath275 is a gaussian white noise .",
    "the total density can be written as @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the average density and @xmath278 is the fluctuating part .",

    "the sp model of interest here has autonomous evolution of the @xmath285 , and corresponds to the lr critical line which separates a wave - carrying phase @xcite from a strongly phase separated state @xcite .",
    "further , in a model of growing binary films considered in @xcite , in the limit where the height profile evolves independently , the problem gets mapped to noninteracting domain walls ( if annihilation is neglected ) rolling down slopes of independently growing surfaces .",
    "the latter problem becomes similar to ours , on thinking of the domain walls as particles .",
    "but the fact that they are noninteracting in contrast to the hard - core particles may introduce other physical effects into the problem .",
    "we start with a surface in steady state , and allow an initially randomly arranged assembly of sliding particles to evolve on it . in an initial short - time relaxation , particles slide down to the bottom of local minima . after this",
    ", the density distribution evolves owing to the rearrangement of the stochastically evolving surface , whose local slopes guide particle motion .",
    "we found in numerical simulations that the surface fluctuations actually drive the system towards large scale clustering of particles .",

    "after time @xmath68 , the base lengths of coarse - grained valleys of length @xmath286 would have overturned , where @xmath2 is the dynamical exponent of the surface .",

    "all of them have slopes @xmath360 , which indicate @xmath11 .",
    "a similar evaluation of @xmath161 was also done for the kpz surface , and is also shown in fig .",
    "[ skrates ] ( upper curves ) .",
    "the observed slope of @xmath361 implies that the cusp exponent remains @xmath306 for all of them .",
    "we conclude that the variation of update rates affects the degree of ordering but not the asymptotic scaling properties , as indicated by the constancy of the cusp exponent @xmath152 .",
    "so far we have considered uphill hopping rate to be strictly zero , i.e. @xmath362 . by allowing for @xmath349 , i.e. allowing for upward motion of particles , we saw that the fdpo persists , so long as @xmath363 . in fig .",
    "[ sk_upneq0 ] , we show @xmath364 as a function of @xmath365 , at a large time @xmath68 for ew and kpz surfaces respectively , when the ratio @xmath366 .",
    "we find that the slopes are @xmath360 and @xmath361 in the two cases indicating that the values of the cusp exponents are still @xmath367 and @xmath306 respectively , for the two surfaces .",
    "this points to the universality of the value @xmath367 ( ew ) and @xmath306 ( kpz ) over a range of models with different values of @xmath368 , and also with respect to varying @xmath369 .",
    "we also investigated the effect of having an overall tilt of the kpz surface .",
    "this leads to an overall movement of the transverse surface fluctuations , which are the analogues of kinematic waves in particle systems @xcite . in the presence of such a wave ,",
    "the profile of hills and valleys of the surface sweep across the system at finite speed , and the particles do not get enough time to cluster .",
    "consequently the phenomenon of fdpo is completely destroyed . in fig .",
    "[ kinekpzspcr ] we show @xmath370 as a function of @xmath37 ( there is no scaling by @xmath78 ) for several @xmath68 .",
    "the curves are independent of @xmath68 , in the absence of coarsening towards a phase ordered state .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the possibility of phase ordering of a sort which is dominated by strong fluctuations . in steady state , these fluctuations lead to variations of the order parameter of order unity , but the system stays ordered in the sense that with probability one , a finite fraction of the system is occupied by a single phase .",
    "the value of this fraction fluctuates in time , leading to a broad probability distribution of the order parameter .",
    "we demonstrated these features in two types of models having to do with surface fluctuations  the first , a coarse - grained depth ( cd ) model where we could establish these properties analytically , and the second a model of sliding particles ( sp ) on the surface in question .",
    "for these models we found that besides ( a ) the broad probability distribution of the order parameter ( which we may take to be the defining characteristic of fdpo ) , the steady state was also characterised by ( b ) power laws of cluster size distributions and ( c ) cusps in the scaled two - point correlation function , associated with the breakdown of the porod law .",
    "the connection between ( b ) and ( c ) was elucidated using the independent interval approximation .",
    "further , an extremal statistics argument showed that the largest cluster drawn from the power law distribution is of the order of the system size ; this implies a macroscopic ordered region , so that within our models , properties ( a ) and ( b ) are connected .",
    "there are several open questions .",
    "does fluctuation - dominated phase ordering occur in other , completely different types of systems as well ?",
    "are properties ( b ) and ( c ) necessarily concomitant with the defining property ( a ) of fdpo ?",
    "can one characterize quantitatively the dynamical behaviour in the fdpo steady state ?",
    "our model of particles sliding on a fluctuating surface relates to several physical systems of interest .",
    "first , it describes a new mechanism of large scale clustering in vibrated granular media , provided the vibrations are random both in space and time .",
    "second , it describes a special case ( the passive scalar limit ) of a crystal driven through a dissipative medium , for instance a sedimenting colloidal crystal @xcite .",
    "finally , related models describe the formation of domains in growing binary films @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see if ideas related to fdpo play a role in any of these systems",
    ".    it would also be interesting to examine fluctuating phase - ordered states in other nonequilibrium systems from the point of view of fdpo .",
    "for instance , in a study of jamming in the bus - route model studied in @xcite , the largest empty stretch in front of a bus was found to be of order @xmath18 , and it is argued that such a stretch survives for a time which is proportional to @xmath371 for a nonvanishing rate of arrival of the passengers . these features are reminescent of the behaviour of the cd and sp models derived from the edwards - wilkinson model discussed above .",
    "however , more work is required to make a clear statement about fdpo in the bus - route model .    in general ,",
    "fluctuation - dominated phase ordering is evidently a possibililty that should be kept in mind when discussing new situations involving phase ordering in nonequilibrium systems , both in theory and in experiment ."
