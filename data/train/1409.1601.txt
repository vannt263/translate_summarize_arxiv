    "rapid star formation makes the simulated central galaxy far too blue and luminous , and the icm temperature gradient peaks well inside 100  kpc as gas with excessively high entropy flows into the cluster core .",
    "observations strongly suggest that outflows from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) provide that feedback ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". clusters with short central cooling times tend to have agns that inflate cavities in the icm at distances @xmath2  kpc from the center .",
    "the total amount of energy in those cavities is sufficient to replace the radiated energy , at least to an order of magnitude , but the exact mechanism of energy transfer remains unknown .",
    "clearly the supermassive black hole within the central parsec of a galaxy cluster is responding to the hot - gas environment , and its response is finely tuned to replace the radiated energy without disrupting the cool core itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "how does the feedback engine know when to turn on , and how does it determine the correct heating rate ?    one of the primary clues to the triggering of agn feedback in cluster cores emerged from our large _",

    "almost all of the 239 entropy profiles in _ accept _ can be fit with the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "strong feedback is seen primarily in systems with core entropy @xmath5 , and the exceptions have low - entropy coronae on kiloparsec scales @xcite .",
    "this core - entropy criterion is roughly equivalent to a central cooling time @xmath6  gyr , in alignment with the finding of @xcite that systems with longer cooling times do not contain x - ray cavities .",
    "two other phenomena common in clusters with @xmath5 are absent from clusters with greater core entropy : extended emission - line nebulae and star formation in the central cluster galaxy @xcite .",
    "the nebulae generally signify the presence of multiphase gas , because systems with h@xmath0 emission also tend to have abundant molecular gas @xcite .",
    "star formation is further confirmation that multiphase gas is present .",
    "these results suggest that strong agn feedback is triggered by development of a multiphase intracluster medium , implying that accretion of cold clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is more important than accretion of hot intercloud gas .",
    "however , most implementations of agn feedback in cluster simulations assume bondi - like accretion from the hot phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while bondi accretion may be energetically plausible in elliptical galaxies @xcite , it is too feeble to power the larger outflows required in massive clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cooling time at small radii can be much shorter than the inflow timescale , invalidating the fundamental bondi assumption of isentropic accretion @xcite .",
    "the core - entropy threshold for feedback , multiphase gas , and star formation was initially interpreted in terms of conduction .",
    "@xcite showed that inward heat conduction in systems with @xmath7 could plausibly replace the energy radiated from the central regions and prevent cooling and condensation ( but see * ? ? ?",

    "agn feedback is not necessary unless @xmath5 , in which case conduction fails to keep pace with cooling , leading to development of a multiphase medium and cold accretion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the multiphase threshold has been interpreted as resulting from thermal instability .",
    "numerical simulations show that thermal instability can produce a multiphase medium in a spherical potential if the ratio of cooling time ( @xmath8 ) to freefall time ( @xmath9 ) is less than @xmath10 , as long as feedback heating is in approximate global balance with radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "heating is necessary for thermal instability because perturbations in a pure cooling flow grow too slowly to produce a multiphase medium if @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "this paper analyzes a much larger cluster sample to explore how both the core - entropy criterion and the thermal - instability criterion relate to observations of h@xmath0 emission in cluster cores .",
    "section 2 updates the results of @xcite and @xcite , showing that the core - entropy criterion sharply separates clusters with h@xmath0 emission from those without it .",
    "section 3 expands on the results of @xcite , showing that the thermal - instability criterion does not produce a clear separation between systems with and without h@xmath0 emission but instead correlates with the prominence of that emission , and presumably also with the total amount of multiphase gas .",
    "section 4 discusses the implications of our results for the triggering of agn feedback .",
    "section 5 considers how gas precipitating out of the icm can become dusty .",
    "section 6 summarizes the paper .",
    "figure  [ k0-lha ] shows the relationship between core entropy and core h@xmath0 luminosity for all _ accept _ clusters with h@xmath0 measurements .",
    "except for a small handful of objects , there is a clear separation in @xmath13 between cluster cores with and without h@xmath0 emission , consistent with the hypothesis that a multiphase medium develops and triggers agn feedback when radiative cooling becomes too rapid for conduction to keep pace .",
    "as described in @xcite , the h@xmath0 measurements come from a heterogenous set of sources , including many long - slit spectra , meaning that they are often lower limits on the true values .",
    "we have therefore suppressed the error bars on the detections to make the figure more legible .",
    "the main quantitative differences between this figure and figure  1 of @xcite are shifts in the horizontal direction having to do with updated @xmath13 values .",
    "only one cluster with @xmath7 has an h@xmath0 detection ( zwicky 2701 ) , and even that cluster may be consistent with @xmath14 within the systematic measurement uncertainties @xcite .     +    five objects with @xmath5 have no detectable h@xmath0 emission : abell  2029 , abell  2107 , abell  2151 , exo  0422 - 086 , and rbs  0533 .",
    "figure  [ kprofs - ha ] shows that conduction can potentially prevent gas from condensing in the cores of four of them .",
    "the figure illustrates the @xmath15 entropy profiles for all of the objects in figure  [ k0-lha ] with @xmath5 .",
    "dotted ( blue ) lines represent profiles of systems with core h@xmath0 emission , and solid ( red ) lines represent profiles of systems without h@xmath0 . the ( black ) dashed line shows the critical @xmath15 profile for conductive balance given by @xcite for a conduction suppression factor @xmath16 applied to the full @xcite conductivity . in clusters with profiles above this line , thermal conduction in the radial direction can supply enough heat to the core to compensate for radiative cooling .",
    "the figure shows that four of the five clusters without h@xmath0 emission have @xmath15 profiles that remain above the critical line .",
    "only one , rbs  0533 , has an entropy profile that drops below it .     +",
    "the relationship between h@xmath0 emission and the minimum value of @xmath17 in cluster cores is somewhat different than the one for core entropy .",
    "figure  [ tc - lha ] shows that relationship .",
    "there is not a clear threshold at @xmath18 like the one at @xmath14 , indicating that the presence of a multiphase medium depends on more than just thermal instability .",
    "however , the steep anticorrelation of @xmath19 with min(@xmath17 ) does suggest that thermal instability determines the _ amount _ of multiphase gas in the core and therefore the strength of the feedback reponse owing to accretion of cold , condensed gas into the agn .    in order to make figure  [ tc - lha ]",
    ", we needed to estimate the gravitational potential as a function of radius for each cluster , which required a few assumptions .",
    "first , we assumed hydrostatic equilibrium , allowing us to estimate the gravitational potential from the gas pressure and temperature profiles in the _",
    "accept _ catalog .",
    "second , we smoothed the pressure and temperature profiles by fitting @xmath20 and @xmath21 with third - order polynomials in @xmath22 .",
    "third , we assumed that a large galaxy resides at the center of each halo .",
    "this last assumption is important for three reasons : ( 1 ) nearly all cool cores are centered on a cluster s brightest galaxy , ( 2 ) that galaxy s stars dominate the gravitational potential within the central @xmath1020  kpc , and ( 3 ) flattening of the pressure profile in a cluster core can lead to a poorly determined or even unconstrained x - ray measurement of the potential at small radii . given the paucity of data on the velocity dispersions of these central galaxies , we approximated them all as singular isothermal spheres with a 250 km  s@xmath23 velocity dispersion ( consistent with e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for clusters without large galaxies at their centers , this last assumption is incorrect .",
    "however , such clusters do not have cool cores and therefore have values of @xmath17 so large that any inaccuracy introduced by this faulty assumption is inconsequential for our analysis .",
    "our assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is likely to be inaccurate , but probably not by more than a few tens of percent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "inaccuracies arising from a lack of hydrostatic equilibrium will lead to underestimates of the gravitational potential and overestimates of @xmath9 , meaning that some of our @xmath17 values may be a few tens of percent too low .",
    "however , assuming that a large galaxy dominates the gravitational potential at the very center of a cluster mitigates these uncertainties .",
    "this section interprets what our results imply about cooling and condensation of the intracluster medium and triggering of the agn feedback presumed to limit it .",
    "first we consider the significance of the core - entropy dichotomy .",
    "then we turn to the significance of the dependence of h@xmath0 emission on the minimum value of @xmath17 .",
    "low core entropy looks like a necessary but not sufficient condition for development of a multiphase medium in a cluster core .",
    "we therefore surmise that high core entropy _ prohibits _ the existence of a multiphase medium .",
    "elsewhere we have proposed that electron thermal conduction with a spitzer suppression factor @xmath24 is what prohibits a multiphase medium in this case @xcite .",
    "theoretical models support this viewpoint @xcite , as long as the level of turbulence in the core is sufficient to keep the suppression factor from dropping too far below @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , others have argued that mhd effects produce far greater suppression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is some observational support for strong suppression .",
    "for that reason , turbulent heat diffusion ( which can be considered a generalized heat conduction mechanism ) also needs to be investigated as potentially responsible for the @xmath13 dichotomy .",
    "we would like to stress that the mechanism responsible for suppressing multiphase structure in cores with @xmath7 must do more than just stop condensation of the intracluster medium .",
    "it must also transport the gas injected by normal stellar mass loss from the central galaxy s stars away from the cluster core while heating it to the ambient icm temperature and destroying its dust grains @xcite . and it must accomplish this task without producing obvious evidence for agn feedback , since cluster cores with @xmath7 seem not to harbor strongly radio - emitting agn @xcite unless those agns reside in cool kpc - scale coronae with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the amount of heat transport required to heat and remove the ejected stellar gas from the central galaxy in a cluster with @xmath7 depends somewhat on the temperature of the ambient hot gas but is typically at least as large as the heat input needed to keep the core gas from cooling .",
    "for example , consider a 5 kev cluster core with @xmath26 .",
    "the mass of ambient gas within 30  kpc of the center is @xmath27 , and the central galaxy s stars are shedding @xmath28 in that same region , requiring a heating+transport timescale @xmath6  gyr , essentially the same as the cooling time of the ambient gas . in clusters of greater central entropy , the energy input required to heat and transport the ejected stellar gas",
    "_ exceeds _ the cooling luminosity of the ambient gas .",
    "this transport mechanism apparently falters in cluster cores below @xmath29  kev  @xmath30 , allowing a multiphase medium to persist , but not in all cases .",
    "recent theoretical work has clarified the conditions under which condensation of a low - entropy core can produce multiphase structure and indicates that the threshold for precipitation in a spherical potential is @xmath18 @xcite . however , according to figure  [ tc - lha ] , this condition is sufficient but not necessary .",
    "cores with h@xmath0 emission span the range @xmath3120 , with a few ranging up to ratios exceeding 30 .",
    "how are we to interpret the multiphase structure in cluster cores with @xmath32 ?",
    "recent simulations of agn feedback triggered by cold precipitation provide some important clues ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in cores without multiphase gas ,",
    "the ambient medium needs to drop below @xmath18 , and maybe as low as @xmath33 @xcite , before a multiphase medium develops and fuels the agn .",
    "when the agn responds , it heats and inflates the ambient medium , raising its entropy and lowering its density until @xmath34 , but does not eradicate the multiphase medium .",
    "instead , fluctuations in the cold accretion rate lead to fluctuations in agn feedback , causing @xmath35 to vary between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see figure 10 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the same range occupied by most of the multiphase cluster cores in figure  [ tc - lha ] .",
    "this agreement should be considered strong observational support for the precipitation - driven cold feedback mechanism .",
    "figure  [ mintrat - k0 ] provides some insight into the exceptions .",
    "all of the h@xmath0-emitting cores with @xmath38 remain below @xmath14 indicating that the cold - gas eradication mechanism operating in clusters of higher core entropy is not quite strong enough to eliminate their multiphase structure .",
    "we suspect these cores are examples of cases in which a strong agn outburst originally triggered during a low @xmath39 state has temporarily boosted the core entropy , but not high enough for heat transport from outside the core to eliminate the multiphase gas . in this interpretation ,",
    "the presence of h@xmath0 in these cores is a hysteresis effect in the agn feedback cycle .",
    "+    figure  [ mintrat - k0 ] also suggests a natural explanation for the five low-@xmath13 clusters without evidence for multiphase gas . while it remains possible that four of them are stabilized by conduction ( see figure  [ kprofs - ha ] ) , it is also the case that all five have @xmath40 , suggesting that this timescale ratio has not yet dropped low enough to produce precipitation in these cores",
    "the preceding sections present a strong case for precipitation - driven agn feedback as the mechanism that stabilizes the lowest - entropy cluster cores , but a fly remains in the ointment : the multiphase gas in cluster cores is known to be dusty ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yet the surrounding hot medium is virtually dust - free ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially near the center @xcite .",
    "in fact , sputtering at the center of a cool - core cluster should destroy all the dust grains in less than a million years ( based on * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "so how can the precipitated gas be dusty ?",
    "one potential solution to this dilemma is feedback - induced mixing . in the cold regions of the milky way s interstellar medium",
    ", pre - existing dust grains can grow by accreting refractory elements from the gas phase @xcite .",
    "the most plausible sources of pre - existing dust grains in cluster cores are dying stars in the central galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "mixing of this stellar dust into cold gas that is accumulating in the central galaxy can preserve it against sputtering , providing sites for molecule formation and further depletion of refractory elements out of the gas phase .",
    "such a mechanism for incorporation of gas - phase metals from the icm into dust grains is far easier to understand than _ ab initio _ dust formation in dust - free clouds of condensing icm gas , particularly since those clouds are unlikely even to form molecules until they have first formed dust grains .",
    "dust in extended multiphase icm filaments therefore indicates that those filaments consist of gas that has been pulled outward from smaller radii , either in the sheaths around agn jets or in the wakes of buoyant bubbles .",
    "if this is the correct interpretation of dust in cluster cores , then it implies that outward advection of low - entropy gas promotes precipitation , perhaps explaining why @xmath17 values in multiphase cluster cores are sometimes greater than those seen in idealized simulations .",
    "as jets and bubbles lift adjacent low - entropy gas to higher altitudes of greater ambient entropy , they locally decrease the @xmath17 ratio in the uplifted lower - entropy gas .",
    "radial mixing of stratified gas that is marginally stable to precipitation therefore destabilizes it .",
    "mixing of dust into the precipitating gas can further destablize it , because the cooling rate of a hot , dusty medium is far greater than that of a hot , dust - free medium at the same temperature .",
    "sputtering rapidly destroys some of the dust , but the temporary decrease in cooling time might be sufficient to cause precipitation in cases where it otherwise would nt happen . if mixing of dust into the ambient gas does indeed catalyze precipitation , then one would expect precipitating gas to be dustier , on average , than gas that is not precipitating .",
    "we have used the subset of _ accept _ galaxy clusters with published h@xmath0 observations to evaluate two hypotheses for the origin of multiphase gas in cluster cores , one based on conduction and @xmath13 and another based on thermal instability and @xmath17 .",
    "our results suggest that these two hypotheses are complementary .",
    "the dichotomy between homogeneous cores and multiphase cores , as traced by h@xmath0 emission , is most distinct when plotted as a function of the core - entropy parameter @xmath13 .",
    "none of the _ accept _ clusters with high core entropy has measurable h@xmath0 emission , indicating that low core entropy is a _ necessary _ condition for a multiphase core . on the other hand ,",
    "all of the _ accept _ clusters with @xmath41 have h@xmath0 emission , indicating that this is a _ sufficient _ condition for a multiphase core .",
    "exceptions to the inverse relations support the notion of complementarity .",
    "the few clusters with low core entropy and no h@xmath0 emission all have @xmath42 , suggesting that their central cooling times are not short enough for precipitation ( although four of the five could also be stabilized by thermal conduction ) . and all of the h@xmath0 emitting clusters with @xmath42 have low core entropy , consistent with the idea that heat transport is incapable of eliminating the multiphase medium in a low - entropy core , once it has formed .",
    "we suspect that these clusters are examples of hysteresis in the agn feedback cycle , which can intermittently raise the central cooling time so that occasional excursions to @xmath42 occur once a multiphase medium has developed .",
    "most multiphase cores have @xmath43 .",
    "this is the same interval spanned over time in cluster - core simulations that rely on precipitating clouds to fuel agn feedback .",
    "we consider this agreement strong evidence in favor of the cold - precipitation paradigm for stabilizing the lowest entropy cluster cores .",
    "the most serious problem with the precipitation paradigm is the dustiness of the multiphase gas .",
    "we suggest that the presence of dust indicates that the precipitating gas has been drawn out of the central galaxy by jets or buoyant bubbles after it has mixed with dusty ejecta from the central galaxy s dying stars .",
    "both uplift and the introduction of dust promote precipitation , because both reduce @xmath17 in the uplifted gas ."
