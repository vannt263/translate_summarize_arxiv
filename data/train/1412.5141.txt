    "a hybrid ion - neutral trap is a combination of two normally separate technologies  a cold neutral atom trap within an ion trap ,",
    "e.g. , a linear radiofrequency quadrupole or octupole @xcite paul trap ( lpt ) .",
    "typically , the neutral trap consists of a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite , an optical dipole trap ( odt ) @xcite , or a magnetically trapped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "recently , a hybrid trap was developed that also incorporates an optical cavity @xcite . over the past decade , since the hybrid trap was originally proposed @xcite , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite interest in low - energy ion - neutral collisions has surged .",
    "cold ion - neutral collisions are of intermediate range between neutral - neutral and ion - ion . compared to neutral - neutral van der waals cross sections @xmath6 a.u . , they have large elastic scattering cross sections @xmath7 a.u .  at 1",
    "mk @xcite .",
    "these large cross sections are a consequence of the ion polarizing the colliding neutral atom , which leads to universal long - range polarization potentials @xcite , with the principal term @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the atomic dipole polarizability of the neutral collision partner and @xmath10 is the internuclear ion - atom separation .",
    "the large ion - neutral elastic scattering cross sections have been utilized to demonstrate hybrid trap sympathetic cooling @xcite of atomic ions translational motion @xcite and molecular ions internal degrees - of - freedom @xcite .",
    "additionally , there have been several measurements of low - energy ion - neutral elastic @xcite and charge - exchange @xcite rate coefficients within hybrid traps .",
    "the rate coefficient measurments are of interest to both astrophysics @xcite and quantum information @xcite .",
    "several methods have been used to measure scattering rates using a hybrid trap , including monitoring the neutral atom fluorescence decay from an odt @xcite and measuring the ion fluorescence decay from a paul trap @xcite .",
    "recently , hybrid trap measurements of the total elastic and change - exchange collision rate for closed shell , optically dark ions on ( rubidium ) were reported by lee _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "the fluorescence of the neutral species is used to measure the total collision rate of optically dark ions .",
    "our method uses the loading and decay of both the atoms in the mot and the dark ions in the lpt to determine the collision rate .",
    "additionally , for optically accessible ions , the methods presented here for determining the total collision rate can be used in conjunction with the previously demonstrated charge - exchange measurement methods to isolate the elastic collision rate .",
    "we present measurements of the total collision rate coefficient for the  ( sodium ) system .",
    "our experimental results show excellent agreement with previously reported fully quantal _",

    "the mot is loaded with @xmath12 k vapor from a biased getter source within the vacuum chamber .",
    "the mot simultaneously uses velocity and spatially dependent light pressure forces that both damp and trap the neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "this force is provided by three pairs of counterpropagating circularly polarized 589 nm laser beams intersecting within an added quadrupole magnetic field gradient of @xmath13 , created with external anti - helmholtz electromagnet coils .",
    "the 589 nm radiation is frequency stabilized to the saturation absorption spectrum of a vapor cell . additionally , three shim coils ( two of them shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ap ] ) are used for translating the mot location within the lpt .",
    "we have seen no experimental evidence to suggest that the mot apparatus interferes with the operation of the lpt apparatus or vice versa @xcite .",
    "we can create two mots that use different hyperfine cycling transitions : type ( i ) 3@xmath14 @xmath15 or type ( ii ) @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "images taken with our cmos camera of both mots ( looking down the lpt s long axis ) are shown in fig .",

    "we can measure the total number of atoms using the mot fluorescence with our camera or a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) ; both measurements typically agree within @xmath17 of one another despite using different collection optics , different viewpoints , and having been independently calibrated .",
    "release and recapture measurements @xcite taken with the pmt indicate that the mot atoms follow a cumulative distribution function consistent with a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) speed distribution .    ,",
    "the camera is looking down the axial ( long ) dimension of the segmented lpt .",

    "@xmath28 ) was chosen for maximum mot fluorescence intensity .",
    "for the type i mot , the cooling laser is the carrier signal from our electro - optical modulator ( eom ) . for the type ii mot ,",
    "the cooling laser is the eom sideband signal.,width=3 ]      the ion - trapping part of the hybrid trap consists of a segmented lpt @xcite .",
    "the rf driving field , with amplitude @xmath29 v , is applied to the center electrode segments creating a sinusoidally oscillating quadrupole saddle potential . oscillating the quadrupole potential at a frequency @xmath30 khz",
    "creates a pseudo - harmonic potential which provides trapping in the transverse dimension @xcite .",
    "the axial ( long dimension ) confinement is established by a static voltage @xmath31 v applied to the end segments .",
    "the evolution of a single trapped ion in an lpt is described by the stable solutions to the mathieu equation @xcite .",
    "each trapped ion undergoes a superposition of fast motion at the driving field s rf angular frequency @xmath32 and a slow secular motion at an angular frequency @xmath33 in the transverse dimensions and @xmath34 in the axial dimension @xcite .",
    "the ion trap is loaded by photoionizing ( pi ) an excited ( @xmath35 ) mot atom with a 405 nm photon .",
    "the pi laser beam has a @xmath36 cm collimated intensity radius and is collinear to one mot beam . therefore , the region of pi is always larger than the mot , even when the mot is translated off - axis from the beam as much as @xmath37 cm . while some background excited atoms are also pi loaded into the lpt , approximately all of the ions are created directly from the mot since the mot density is @xmath38 orders of magnitude larger than that of the background vapor .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of the trapped ion cloud @xmath39 , loaded from either the type i or the type ii mot , was determined using simion 7.0 simulations @xcite of ion clouds containing an ion population @xmath40 of up to @xmath41 interacting ions .",
    "it takes approximately 1.4 ms or 238 secular periods for the ion cloud to equilibrate . for a detailed discussion of our group s simulations ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite . the most important factor in predicting the ion cloud",
    "s thermalized mean secular energy ( from which one can assign a temperature , assuming a mb speed distribution ) is the size of the mot when the lpt is loaded via pi from a mot @xcite .",
    "because the initial speed of the ions created from the mot is so small , the total initial energy of the ion cloud is primarily determined by the potential energy of the ions , which is directly related to the initial size of the mot .",
    "therefore , since we can accurately measure the size of the mot , we can accurately initialize our simulations .",
    "the simulation determined the thermalized temperature of the ion cloud loaded from the type i and ii mots to be @xmath42 k and @xmath43 k , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath39 is only based on the precision of camera measurements of the mots dimensions .     at a fixed ion input current .",
    "we find that the output ion signal ( which is proportional to the gain ) looks very linear when plotted with a log - linear plot scaling , indicating that we are not saturating the cem .",
    "the uncertainty in the power supply voltage @xmath44 and the ion signal is approximately the size of the plot markers . in the experiments presented here we operate at a @xmath45 v.,width=3 ]",
    "an undesirable complication with a mot hybrid trap is that the mot continuously forms molecular ions via photoassociative ionization and energetic ( @xmath46 ) atomic is subsequently created via 589 nm photodissociation @xcite . to remove the undesired ions , we add to the driving rf voltage a small mass selective resonant quenching ( msrq ) @xcite voltage with amplitude @xmath47 v at a frequency @xmath48 khz , which corresponds to the measured second harmonic secular frequency @xmath49 $ ] for .",
    "the msrq signal resonantly drives the secular motion of the co - trapped until the molecular ion s energy exceeds the lpt s trap depth . as a result",
    ", the added msrq field continuously quenches the population with little to no off - resonant heating of the trapped @xcite .    because the ions have a closed electronic configuration optical measurements are not possible , so we must destructively measure the trapped ion population .",
    "we apply a dipole field to the end segments , which extracts the ion cloud axially out of the trap and into a channeltron electron multiplier ( cem ) .",
    "the ion extraction trajectories are controlled by the ion optics , which are determined by the end segment and mesh electrode voltages .",
    "the cem signal goes through a charge - sensitive preamplifier , which produces a signal whose peak voltage is proportional to the number of detected ions",
    ". we will refer to the peak preamplifier voltage as the  cem measured ion signal . \"",
    "details regarding the calibration of the cem will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ionmeas ] .",
    "we tested the linearity of the dynamic range of the cem to ensure that the it was not saturated when detecting large ion populations , @xmath50 .",
    "cems typically produce linear output in an analog mode when the output current @xmath51 of the bias current .",
    "the bias current is linearly proportional to the applied cem cone voltage @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the output current @xmath52 depends on the gain @xmath53 and the input current @xmath54 , where the gain increases exponentially with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "we use a megaspiraltron from photonis , which has a particularly large bias current , @xmath55 at @xmath56 v. by operating at a low @xmath57 v , we reduced the gain exponentially while the bias current falls off linearly , which helps to keep @xmath58 below the @xmath59 limit for large ion signals .    when the cem saturates , the gain will cease to increase exponentially with increasing @xmath44 for a fixed input ion current @xmath54 .",
    "we measured the output ion signal , which is @xmath60 for a fixed @xmath54 , as a function of @xmath44 for many different pi intensities , for both mots , and at several different ion optic settings .",
    "in all cases we found that for a fixed @xmath54 the log of the ion signal was linear with @xmath44 within the experimental uncertainty , which suggests that the cem is not saturating ( as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : ctgain ] ) .",
    "we were surprised by this result , because if the ion output current is estimated using the expected order of magnitude for the gain , it is @xmath61 of the bias current and should be in the nonlinear region .",
    "we speculate that not all of the ions are reaching the cem detection cone .",
    "this sub - unity collection efficiency is not a problem as long as we are approximately losing the same fraction of the total number of ions trapped during each extraction , which we found to be consistent with our data .",
    "we assume the trapped ions adhere to a prolate gaussian spatial distribution with @xmath19 radii @xmath62 in the transverse dimensions and @xmath63 in the axial dimension",

    "two - body charge - exchange occurs when an electron is transferred from the ion to the atom .",
    "the charge - exchange process is considered resonant if the internal states are exchanged without changing the total internal energy .",
    "a collision is elastic if no charge exchange occurs and the total kinetic energy is conserved .",
    "the total scattering cross section @xmath66 has a @xmath67 relative collision energy @xmath68 dependence , where @xmath69 is the total scattering proportionality constant , @xmath70 is the elastic scattering cross section , and @xmath71 is charge - exchange scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "the total scattering constant @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the reduced mass of the two - body collision .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sigmatot ] ) is incorrectly stated as only the elastic scattering cross sections in refs .",

    "<S> we present measurements of the total elastic and resonant charge - exchange ion - atom collision rate coefficient @xmath0 of cold sodium ( ) with optically - dark low energy ions in a hybrid ion - neutral trap . to determine @xmath0 , we measured the trap loading and loss from both a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and a linear radio frequency quadrupole paul trap . </S>",
    "<S> we found the total rate coefficient to be @xmath1 @xmath2/s for the type i mot immersed within an @xmath3 k ion cloud and @xmath4 @xmath2/s for the type ii mot within an @xmath5 k ion cloud . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements show excellent agreement with previously reported theoretical fully quantal _ </S>",
