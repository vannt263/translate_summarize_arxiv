    "a quantum computer promises extraordinary power over a classical computer , as demonstrated by shor  @xcite in 1994 with the polynomial quantum algorithm for solving the factoring problem , for which the best known classical algorithms are exponential .",
    "just how much more powerful are quantum computers ? in particular , can a quantum computer solve np - complete problems  @xcite _ more _ efficiently than a classical computer ?",
    "np - complete problems are the `` hardest '' problems in np  in the sense that if one can solve one np - complete problem efficiently ( i.e. , in polynomial time ) then one can solve all the problems in np in polynomial time . in 2000 , farhi et al.@xcite proposed an adiabatic quantum algorithm as an alternative quantum paradigm to directly solve np - hard optimization problems , which are polynomially equivalent to their corresponding np - complete decision problems . apparently , the same idea to the adiabatic quantum optimization , under a different name of _ quantum annealing",
    ", was first put forward by apolloni et al . in 1988 , see @xcite and references therein for a history of the field .",
    "an adiabatic quantum algorithm is described by a time - dependent system hamiltonian @xmath0 for @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "there are three components of @xmath4 : ( 1 ) initial hamiltonian : @xmath5 ; ( 2 ) problem hamiltonian : @xmath6 ; and ( 3 ) evolution path : @xmath7 \\longrightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] , e.g. , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is an adiabatic algorithm for a problem if we encode the problem into the problem hamiltonian @xmath10 such that the ground state of @xmath10 corresponds to the answer to the problem .",
    "the initial hamiltonian @xmath11 is chosen to be non - commutative with @xmath10 and its ground state must be known and experimentally constructable , e.g. , @xmath12 . here @xmath13 is the running time of the algorithm .",
    "according to the adiabatic theorem , if @xmath9 evolves `` slowly '' enough , or equivalently , if @xmath13 is `` large '' enough , which scales polynomially with the inverse of the _ minimum spectral gap _ @xmath14 ( the difference between the two lowest energy levels ) of the system hamiltonian , the system remains in the ground state of @xmath9 , and consequently , ground state of @xmath6 gives the solution to the problem .",
    "this computational model is referred as the _ adiabatic quantum computation _ ( aqc ) .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that aqc is polynomially equivalent to conventional quantum computation ( quantum circuit model ) . for the optimization problem , the problem hamiltonian can be expressed as a diagonal matrix in the computational basis .",
    "that is , let @xmath15 be a cost function of the optimization problem such that the minimum of the @xmath16 corresponds to the solution of the optimization problem , then the corresponding problem hamiltonian @xmath10 is the hamiltonian with @xmath16 as the energy function : namely , @xmath17 ( which needs to be expressible in polynomial resources , such as eq . ( 4 ) ) .",
    "hereafter we use the cost function and the energy function of the problem hamiltonian interchangeably .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize here that given a problem , there can be many possible cost functions and thus many possible problem hamiltonians for the same problem .",
    "this restricted model is referred as the _ adiabatic quantum optimization _ ( aqo ) ( which is no longer polynomially equivalent to the quantum circuit model ) .",
    "we remark that this distinction between aqc and aqo was not made by altshuler  et  al .",
    "@xcite ( they referred both as aqo ) . in this paper , the focus is on this restricted model .",
    "the np - complete problems that were initially proposed for aqo by farhi et al.@xcite were 3sat and a special case of 3sat  exact cover 3 ( ec3 ) .",
    "as an example , they proposed a clause - violation cost function as the energy function of the problem hamiltonian .",
    "namely , @xmath18 .",
    "this cost function ( with perhaps constant difference ) has been adopted by almost all the other adiabatic quantum computation works .",
    "in particular , van dam and vazirani  @xcite claimed that aqo failed to solve a family of 3sat instances by showing that the aqo algorithm with this specific clause - violation cost function had the exponentially small minimum spectral gap .",
    "see discussion for more discussion on some other similar claims(@xcite ) .",
    "recently , altshuler et al .",
    "@xcite claimed that aqo failed for the average case of np - complete problems by arguing this specific clause - violation cost function based aqo algorithm failed for random instances of ec3 , because of the anderson localization phenomenon .",
    "while the cost function proposed is a `` natural '' one , nevertheless , it is not the only possible one .",
    "recall that , according to the formulation of an aqo algorithm , the requirement of the problem hamiltonian is that the ground state corresponds to the solution .",
    "there can be other cost functions with the same minimum ( solution ) , e.g. , see the reduction below .",
    "that is , there are other problem hamiltonians that have the same ground state but a different energy spectrum .",
    "given a problem , there are three components ( initial hamiltonian , problem hamiltonian , and evolution path ) that specify an aqo algorithm for the problem . a change in one component ( e.g. problem hamiltonian ) will result in a different aqo algorithm for the same problem . so how to prove that aqo fails for a problem ?",
    "when is it sufficient to argue for one specific cost function ( and thus specific problem hamiltonian ) and generalize to all other possible problem hamiltonians ?      in this paper , we make clear that the arguments in both van dam and vazirani  @xcite and altshuler  et  al .",
    "@xcite for their specific aqo algorithm do not generalize .",
    "we do so by concretely describing another problem hamiltonian for the same problem to which their arguments no longer apply .",
    "the counter - arguments we provide are simple enough that researchers who are not familiar with aqc and/or do not fully understand the arguments in @xcite can easily follow .",
    "our problem hamiltonians are based on the polynomial reductions ",
    "np - complete problems , by definition , can be polynomially reducible to each other  to the maximum - weight independent set problem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which is one of the well studied np - complete problems .",
    "perhaps , a more interesting and important question is : would the np - complete reduction make a difference for the adiabatic complexity of the problem ? recall that the reduction requires only the solution to be preserved ,",
    "i.e. there is a polynomial time algorithm that maps the solution to the reduced problem to the solution to the original problem and vice versa ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , the reduction might only preserve the solution ( i.e. the ground state ) and alter the energy levels of the problem hamiltonian . in @xcite , we demonstrate that even in small examples , the minimum spectral gap can be increased drastically when the excited energy levels are changed , due to the freedom in selecting parameters in the problem hamiltonian . thus",
    ", different reductions are possible , giving rise to different problem hamiltonians , and thus different aqo algorithms , for the same problem .",
    "what are the time complexities of these different aqo algorithms ?",
    "unfortunately , at this point , the analytical analysis of these algorithms , which requires bounding the minimum spectral gap of the system hamiltonian , remains challenging . whether the time complexity of each of these aqo algorithms is polynomial or exponential remains open and requires further investigation .",
    "in the following , we first recall the np - complete maximum - weight independent set ( mis ) problem , and a problem hamiltonian for solving mis . then we describe a simple reduction from exact cover to mis that results in a different problem hamiltonian ( and thus different aqo algorithm ) for exact cover .",
    "we then make clear that the argument in altshuler  et  al .",
    "@xcite does not apply to this algorithm .",
    "similarly , we recall the well - known reduction from 3sat to mis , and point out that the argument in @xcite does not apply to the mis - based aqo algorithm .",
    "formally , the maximum - weight independent set problem is as follows :    an undirected graph @xmath19 , where each vertex @xmath20 is weighted by a positive rational number @xmath21    * output : * a subset @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is independent ( i.e. , for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and the total _ weight _ of @xmath23 ( @xmath27 ) is maximized .",
    "denote the optimal set by @xmath28 .",
    "this is referred as the _ optimization _ version of mis .",
    "the corresponding _ decision _ problem is :    * question : * is there an independent subset @xmath29 such that the total weight is at least @xmath30 ? ( where the positive rational number @xmath30 is the extra input parameter . )    technically speaking , the decision version of mis is np - complete , and the optimization version of mis is np - hard . since the decision problem and the optimization problem are polynomially transformable to each other , in the following , we will simply refer to the mis problem , without explicitly mentioning which version ( optimization or decision ) . in general , which version should be clear from the context .    one way to solve",
    "the mis problem is by maximizing a quadratic binary function @xmath31 ( also known as pseudo - boolean function ) defined in the following theorem ( theorem 5.1 in @xcite ) .    if @xmath32 for all @xmath33 , then the maximum value of @xmath34 is the total weight of the mis . in particular if @xmath35 for all @xmath33 , then @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",

    "<S> one of the most important questions in studying quantum computation is : whether a quantum computer can solve np - complete problems more efficiently than a classical computer ? in 2000 , farhi , et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( science , 292(5516):472476 , 2001 ) proposed the adiabatic quantum optimization ( aqo ) , a paradigm that directly attacks np - hard optimization problems . </S>",
    "<S> how powerful is aqo ? </S>",
    "<S> early on , van dam and vazirani claimed that aqo failed ( i.e. would take exponential time ) for a family of 3sat instances they constructed . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , altshuler , et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( proc natl acad sci usa , 107(28 ) : 1244612450 , 2010 ) claimed that aqo failed also for random instances of the np - complete exact cover problem . in this paper , we make clear that all these negative results are only for a _ specific _ aqo algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by demonstrating different aqo algorithms for the same problem for which their arguments no longer hold . whether aqo fails or succeeds for solving the np - complete problems ( either the worst case or the average case ) requires further investigation . </S>",
    "<S> our aqo algorithms for exact cover and 3sat are based on the polynomial reductions to the np - complete maximum - weight independent set ( mis ) problem . </S>"
