    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are bursts of high - energy light whose properties are similar to those of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) : they are transient events of short duration ( typically a minute ) , distributed isotropically on the sky , and have fluences , frequencies ( number per day ) , and spectra comparable to those of grbs @xcite .",
    "their spectra are similar to those of grbs but their peak energies in the @xmath3 spectrum , @xmath4 , are smaller than those of grbs @xcite . in various respects , xrfs seem to be a low - energy extension of grbs . in light of these similarities , it is tempting to try to unify these classes of events into a single framework ( e.g. , lamb , donaghy , & graziani , 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "differences between xrfs and grbs may be intrinsic , caused for instance by different lorentz factor @xcite or by a high baryon load @xcite .",
    "they might be extrinsic ; in particular the observed properties are determined by the viewing angle @xcite .",
    "the redshift of xrf  020903 ( @xmath5 ; soderberg et al . , 2004 ;",
    "this paper ) clearly shows that xrfs are cosmic explosions of phenomenal power , almost comparable to grbs .",
    "the isotropic energy of this xrf is very large ( @xmath6 erg ) though not as large as that of typical grbs ( up to @xmath7 erg ; see bloom , frail & kulkarni , 2003 ) .",
    "the similarities and differences between xrfs and grbs will hopefully help us elucidate the nature of these events and perhaps find a common model describing both phenomena .",
    "one obvious requirement for a unified model is that both types of event ( xrfs and grbs ) have the same kind of progenitor . for gamma - ray bursts it is now clear that they are associated with core - collapse supernovae ( sn ) of type ib / c .",
    "this grb / sn connection has received more and more support over the years . some theoretical models ( e.g. woosley , 1993 ;",
    "see zhang , woosley , & heger , 2004 , for recent developments ) predict such a connection for grbs and xrfs , but it is only with grb  980425 that observations showed the first hint of this association @xcite .",
    "the bump on the light curve of grb  011121 and its rapid color evolution ( e.g. garnavich et al . 2003 ) provided strong evidence in favor of this genetic link between grbs and sne . there have been other grbs with `` bumps '' ( `` bump '' is here defined as a rebrightening observed 15 - 20 days after the burst ) in their light curves that could be attributed to sne but none were as definitive as grb  030329 @xcite ; the spectrum of this burst showed features that could only be explained with the existence of an underlying type ib / c sn .",
    "later , @xcite presented spectroscopic evidence for the existence of a sn associated with grb  031203 . in cases",
    "where a sn could have been detected , there was indeed a bump on the light curve ( see zeh et al , 2004 , and references therein ) .    when it comes to xrfs however , the situation is less clear .",
    "@xcite presented for several x - ray flashes .",
    "although the conclusions of their study are limited by the fact that some objects do not have a measured redshift , they do detect supernova signatures in some cases .",
    "in contrast , they also put strong upper limits on the brightness of any possible sn associated with some of the events they studied .",
    "@xcite showed that xrf  030723 actually had a strong bump on its light curve that could be fit reasonably well with the light curve of sn  1994i . at the time of the bump",
    "the energy distribution was very red and was not consistent with a power law .",
    "furthermore , @xcite report a non - detection of supernova features in the light curves of xrf  011030 and xrf  020427 .",
    "all one can say from these works is that if xrfs are associated with sne , they cover a large range in peak magnitude .",
    "it is thus necessary to observe xrfs thoroughly and determine the peak magnitude of any sn associated with these events .    the burst xrf  020903 was detected by the _ high energy transient explorer 2 _ ( hete-2 ) on 3 september 2002 at 10:05:38 @xcite .",
    "optical observations started within a few hours after the burst .",
    "initially no afterglow was detected @xcite .",
    "images taken 6 d apart on the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) blanco 4  m telescope did not show an obvious variable source @xcite .",
    "the analysis we present here shows that the optical transient ( ot ) varied very little between these two epochs . using data obtained on 4 september and 10 september 2002 , @xcite reported ( 26 days after the burst ) the discovery of an optical afterglow . from optical spectroscopy obtained on 28",
    "september 2002 , @xcite measured a redshift @xmath8 ; this was the first reported redshift for an xrf . a fading radio source was also discovered ( at the position @xmath9 , @xmath10 , soderberg et al .",
    "2002 , as updated by soderberg et al .",
    "2004 ) , indicating an association with xrf  020903 .",
    "after about 30 days , there was no variability observed in the optical @xcite , presumably because of the bright host galaxy . further",

    "furthermore , there was no detected emission beyond 10 kev .",
    "xrf  020903 is thus one of the most extreme x - ray flashes observed by hete-2 ( see sakamoto et al .",

    "between 10 and 14 october 2002 , and then on 26 october , we obtained @xmath18 data with the danish 1.5  m telescope at la silla observatory @xcite .",

    "the first- and second - epoch images were then aligned with the third - epoch image . subtracting the third image from the first epoch gave a clear detection of the ot , and a very accurate position .    given the brightness of the ot after @xmath26 days , it is possible that , for a plausible decay rate , the ot might still be contributing to the total light observed during the third  epoch ( after 301 days , for an exposure time of 3840 seconds ) . to test this , we measured the fluxes in a small aperture on the three original images ( i.e. , not subtracted ) at the position of the ot ; the total flux thus contained the contribution of the host galaxy within this aperture .",
    "we fitted an exponential decline rate plus constant to the three fluxes ( fitting a power law yields the same result ) @xmath27 the parameters are the half - life , normalization , and host flux within the aperture .",
    "it turned out that the fitted flux of the host within the aperture ( the parameter c ) was smaller than the flux measured for the third epoch .",
    "this means that indeed , the ot was contributing some light during the third epoch .",
    "the consequence is that when we subtracted the third epoch from the first and second epochs , we introduced a bias in the sense that we subtracted too much light , since the ot was still contributing in the third epoch , used as reference .",
    "this is almost inconsequential for the first epoch but it is a significant fraction of the total ot flux in the second epoch .",

    "the measured and corrected magnitudes are given in table  [ tbl_hst ] .",
    "we find that the decay rate is 0.0167 mag / day , corresponding to an exponential decay time of about 60  d. this is intermediate between the @xmath37- and @xmath38-band decay of sn  1998bw ( 0.0141 and 0.0184 mag / day respectively ; mckenzie & schaefer 1999 ) .",

    "the striking feature of figure  [ fig_sed ] is the change in the shape of the energy distribution . at 38.6  d the sed was very red .",
    "a formal power - law fit to the sed gives an exponent @xmath45 .",
    "there is , however , some noticeable curvature in the sed . in this respect ,",
    "the behavior of xrf  020903 resembles that of another xrf , 030723 @xcite , whose sed was well represented by a power law in the first few days but after @xmath12 weeks it had a strong curvature .",
    "figure  [ fig_sed ] also shows that at 38.6 d the sed resembled that of local stripped - envelope core - collapse supernovae such as sn  1998bw and sn  1993j , although with less curvature .      to the data described in sec .",
    "[ sec_obs ] , we added two measurements from @xcite in order to fill the large gap in the time coverage of this burst .",

    "the resulting light curve is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc ] .",
    "there are upper limits on the brightness of the afterglow from several early searches @xcite .",
    "this might be explained when one considers the combination of the palomar 200  data @xcite with ours : we see that there was an initial rise , particularly marked between our first epoch ( 0.68 d ) and the first observations at palomar after 0.9 d. early on the afterglow was too faint to be seen . assuming that the rise follows a power law ( @xmath46 ) , the index is @xmath47 .",
    "several other bursts show this kind of behavior early on ( a fast rise , sometimes preceded by a relatively flat phase ) .",
    "for instance , grb  970508 had a `` plateau '' after which it rose by @xmath48 mag within @xmath49 day before decaying according to a power law @xcite .",
    "it turns out that grb  970508 is an x - ray rich burst close to the xrf regime ( this is obtained from the integration of the spectrum given by amati et al .",
    "grb  030418 is also an x - ray rich grb @xcite whose afterglow rose during the first @xmath50 half hour @xcite .",
    "another x - ray rich burst , grb  041006 , had a very shallow early decay ( see the data compilation in granot et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the afterglow of grb  030723 , an xrf , had an almost flat light curve during most of the first day .",
    "all these soft bursts seem to show a trend between the softness of the prompt emission and the early decay rate of the afterglow . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that , depending on the viewing angle it is possible to have a rapidly rising afterglow , such as is observed for xrf  020903 . in the models of @xcite and @xcite the shape of the light curve is determined in particular by the opening angle of the jet , the viewing angle ( or rather , the relation between these two angles ) , and the angular distribution of energy across the jet . in their model ,",
    "x - ray flashes are seen off - axis , i.e. , the viewing angle is larger than the opening angle of the jet .",
    "using this approach , @xcite can reproduce the light curves of xrf  030723 and grb  041006 fairly well .",
    "for xrf  020903 , we can say in particular that in order to have a fast rise , one needs a jet with a very sharp edge @xcite .    because of the large gap between 0.9 d and 5.7 d after the burst , it is impossible to know when the ot reached its maximum brightness",
    ". it is equally impossible to know its decay rate .",
    "if we assume that the ot reached maximum brightness at 0.9 d and also assume that it subsequently decayed following a power - law ( @xmath51 ) , then the index is @xmath52 in this 5 day time interval . if the afterglow continued to rise after 0.9 d then the later decay will be faster than @xmath53 . given the paucity of data in the first week , we can not rule a more complex behavior of the afterglow .",
    "in particular , the second palomar 5 m data point at 6.9 d implies a faster decay ( although this measurement has a large uncertainty ) .    for some late - time images ( obtained later than 25 days after the burst ) , particularly in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 passbands , the optical transient was not detected in the subtracted frames , we could only set upper limits to the magnitudes ( see table  [ tbl_phot ] ) . from @xmath16 band data",
    "one can nevertheless say that the ot must have decayed very slowly between 6 and 26 d. after that time it became fainter at a fast rate .",
    "this decay continued at least until 300 d after the burst , as evidenced by the  data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lc ] ) .",
    "the ot decayed by @xmath54 mag between 5 d and 26 d , after which the flux decreased at a faster rate .",
    "figure  [ fig_lc ] shows that a simple broken power - law model will fail to describe the light curve ; the addition of a supernova component is necessary to fit the late - time bump .",
    "for the fit , we corrected the magnitudes for the foreground reddening .",
    "the sn  1998bw data were also corrected for the reddening using the value of @xcite .",
    "we tried to reproduce the light curve by fitting a combination of power law ( with two free parameters - decay index and flux normalisation ) , and shifted sn  1998bw light curve ( adding two more free parameters - magnitude shift and time stretch factor ; see e.g. zeh et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "concentrating on the data obtained after 5 days , the fit yields the following results : the power law has an index equal to @xmath55 ; the supernova light curve is that of sn  1998bw in the @xmath38 band - band light curve of sn  1998bw because at a redshift of 0.251 , the observed @xmath16 band is almost exactly equal to the rest - frame @xmath38 band . ]",
    "shifted by @xmath56 mag ( fainter ) .",
    "a stretch factor was also applied to the sn light curve although it does not appear necessary ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we tried other sn light curves , in particular those of sn ib 1993j @xcite and sn ic 1994i @xcite .",
    "both gave substantially poorer fits than sn  1998bw .",
    "we conclude that the supernova associated with xrf  020903 was very similar to sn  1998bw , except that it was fainter and redder ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sed ] ) .",
    "the sn could actually be brighter than the limit derived above if there is some internal reddening .",
    "these results are consistent with , but more precise than , those of @xcite .",
    "they found that the supernova is @xmath58 mag fainter than sn  1998bw , and that the sn light curve had to be `` compressed '' , i.e. , a faster decay than sn  1998bw .",
    "we believe that our better photometry ( obtained via image subtraction , as opposed to simply extracted from the grb coordinates network circulars ) , and the correction of  data for over - subtraction explain these differences .    several supernovae associated with grbs are sufficiently well characterized ( see , e.g. , zeh et al .",
    "2004 ) that one can plot the sn luminosity ( in units of sn  1998bw ) versus the sn decay time .",
    "@xcite hinted at a correlation between these two quantities . with a luminosity ratio of @xmath54 and a stretch factor of 1 , the sn associated with xrf  020903",
    "adds to the dispersion in this plot , and does not follow the trend seen for type ia sne @xcite . a large amount of reddening ( @xmath59 )",
    "would bring this sn in line with the trend but there is no evidence for this amount of reddening .",
    "actually , with @xmath60 , the reddening - corrected sed at 0.68 d would be flat ( slope=0 ) .",
    "we consequently take this value of @xmath61 as a strong upper limit .",
    "were the reddening so large ( 0.165 ) , then the sn brightness at maximum would only be 0.3 mag fainter than sn  1998bw .",
    "as noted above however , this is very strong upper limit and this transform into a strong upper limit on the peak magnitude of the sn associated with xrf  020903 .",
    "@xmath18 host magnitudes ( see table  [ tbl_host ] ) were obtained from late - time ground - based images . even though these images were obtained in good seeing conditions",

    "this is beyond the range of values for which the 23 method has been calibrated ( see , e.g. , kewley & dopita 2002 ; kobulnicky & kewley 2004 ) . consequently , we can not use the 23 ratio to determine an accurate abundance .",
    "there are several possible reasons explaining why the 23 ratio is high .",
    "one is that the average density in the host of xrf  020903 is higher than in the models of @xcite .",
    "this is sometimes observed for lyman - break galaxies ( l. kewley , 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "another reason is that the excitation process may not be purely due to photoionization .",
    "in particular , shock excitation would change the line ratios , seriously compromising the 23 method .",
    "we can nevertheless obtain an upper limit on the abundance [ o / h ] , using the fact that the [ n  ii ] @xmath90 line is not detected .",
    "we estimated the average noise ( @xmath41 ) in the wavelength region around this line , and took the upper limit on the line flux as @xmath91 erg  s@xmath92  @xmath93 . from the ratio of @xmath94([n  ii]/h@xmath95",
    ", we obtain an upper limit on the abundance , namely [ o / h]@xmath96 dex ( see figure  7 of kewley & dopita 2002 ) .",
    "the early afterglow of xrf  020903 behaved rather unexpectedly , as it rose in the first day .",
    "this type of time evolution has already been seen in a few other grb / xrf afterglows .",
    "some models can actually reproduce this behavior .",
    "in particular , @xcite attribute this to the fact that the burst is seen away from the symmetry axis of the jet ( sec .",
    "[ sec_early ] ) .",
    "a rising light curve is a prediction of the off - axis model and it is interesting to note that , as the most extreme object of this class , xrf  020903 also has a very fast early rise .",
    "the afterglow light curves of several other soft bursts showing a plateau or a rising phase may be explained in the framework of this model .",
    "the behavior of these bursts shows that there may then be a relation between the softness of the burst and the shape of the early optical light curve of the afterglow .",
    "the optical transient was still fairly bright after @xmath97  d. the late - time evolution of xrf  020903 is well described by the light curve of sn  1998bw , shifted by 0.8 mag ( fainter ) .",
    "the other striking feature is the very red sed at 38  d after the burst ( @xmath98  d in the rest frame ) .",
    "a supernova seems to be the only way to have such a red and curved sed , as other explanations predict a power law for the sed .",
    "assuming for a moment that there is no sn and that the late - time fading is a power law , it is very surprising that a local supernova , sn  1998bw , would fit the light curve _ and _ the sed so well .",
    "furthermore , it is a challenge to grb models to explain how the afterglow could have remained so bright for over 30 days ( decaying only by @xmath54  mag in 20 days ) and be so red . in summary ,",
    "the existence and brightness of the bump , its timing , and the sed at 38  d , can all be explained naturally by a sn . adding this to the fact that a spectrum of the ot at 24.6  d strongly resembles a spectrum of sn  1998bw @xcite",
    ", there is no doubt that xrf  020903 is associated with a core - collapse supernova .",
    "the global properties of the host galaxy are similar to those of other grb host galaxies , in the sense that it is subluminous , actively star - forming , and fairly metal - poor .",
    "it resembles the host of grb  031203 ( prochaska et al . , 2004 ; see also sollerman et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "it is unfortunate that the afterglow was not detected at early times . after re - analysis of early data , the announcement of an afterglow at optical and radio wavelengths @xcite came at a time when the host was already dominating the optical flux .",
    "this made photometry difficult and most groups stopped taking data .",
    "it is conceivable that the afterglow may have been missed at early times because of the presence of the host . even in the presence of a bright host ,",
    "it is worth taking data for a long time after the burst , since image subtraction can provide reliable light curves .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on swift provides positions good enough that the emergence of a supernova in the xrt error box after @xmath99 weeks would pinpoint the location of the host galaxy .",
    "grb  020410 is a perfect example of this strategy @xcite .",
    "while there is clearly a sn associated with xrf  020903 , there are several xrfs where the evidence for a sn is weak , if not lacking altogether .",
    "@xcite and @xcite constrain the brightness of any sn associated with several x - ray flashes , although the lack of measured redshifts for some objects make these constraints less strong than one would wish .",
    "xrf  030723 had a strong bump on its light curve @xcite that is interpreted as a sn , akin to sn  1994i , and a sn similar to sn  1998bw can be confidently excluded for that xrf .",
    "all this shows that if every xrf has an underlying sn , they have a broad range of peak luminosities @xcite and light curve shapes .",
    "this being said , there is now at least one good example of a classical grb ( e.g. stanek et al .",
    "2003 , hjorth et al .",
    "2003 , matheson et al .",
    "2003 for grb  030329 ) , x - ray rich grb ( stanek et al . 2005 , soderberg et al 2005 , for grb  041006 ) , and x - ray flash ( this paper and soderberg et al . , 2005 , for xrf  020903 ) clearly associated with supernovae .",
    "this is predicted by theoretical models of stellar collapse @xcite and by grb models where the difference between these various events is explained by a different viewing geometry .",
    "all this reinforces the suspicion that xrfs , x - ray rich grbs , and long grbs are slightly different outcomes of the same phenomenon : the collapse of a massive star .",
    "the physical mechanisms powering these events appear to be very similar , albeit with a fairly wide variety of observational properties .",
