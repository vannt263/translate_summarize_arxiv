    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) is a more fundamental theory than is classical mechanics ( cm ) .",
    "this fact does not diminish the utility of cm in describing the behavior of macroscopic objects .",
    "but theoretical consistency demands that the observed classical phenomena should also emerge from qm in an appropriate limit . however , a detailed understanding of this quantum - to - classical ( qc ) limit is remarkably difficult to achieve , and the origin of classical behavior is even subject to a degree of controversy .",
    "there has been some confusion as to which qm structures should be compared with classical predictions , and hence to what the appropriate criterion for classicality should be .",
    "the role that decoherence due to environmental perturbations might play in establishing the qc limit is also controversial .    a criterion for classicality that has often been used",
    "is based on ehrenfest s theorem @xcite .",
    "if the size of the quantum state is small compared to the scale on which the potential energy varies , then the centroid of the state will approximately follow a classical newtonian trajectory . the time duration ( and range of other relevant parameters )",
    "within which this condition holds is referred to as the _",
    "ehrenfest regime_. since any wave packet will eventually spread until it reaches the size of the system ( harmonic oscillators being a unique exception ) , it follows that this criterion for classicality will eventually fail , no matter how macroscopic the system may be .",
    "if the _ break time _ when this occurs were as long as the age of the solar system , there would be no cause for concern .",
    "but in chaotic systems , the size of a wave packet grows exponentially , and the break time can be quite small .",
    "a striking example , given by zurek @xcite , is the chaotic tumbling of hyperion ( a moon of saturn ) , for which the ehrenfest criterion for classicality will fail in less than 20 years .",
    "zurek argues that _ environmental decoherence _",
    "can remove this paradox and restore classical behavior to hyperion .",
    "this claim is certainly not correct , as long as the ehrenfest criterion for classicality is used .",
    "however , we propose another criterion for classicality , within which the role of decoherence will be reassessed .",
    "the origin of the above paradox consists in a failing to take proper account of the statistical nature of qm .",
    "it is not correct to identify the trajectory of a body with the motion of the centroid of the wave function .",
    "qm does not describe the actual observed phenomenon , but only the probabilities of the various possible phenomena .",
    "we should , therefore , compare quantum probabilities with classical probabilities .",
    "this leads us to define the _ liouville regime _ of quantum- classical correspondence , within which the quantum probabilities are approximately equal to the classical probabilities that satisfy the liouville equation .",
    "there is no requirement that the probability distributions be narrow , and so the liouville regime of classicality is usually much larger than the ehrenfest regime .",
    "the superiority of the liouville criterion for classicality to the ehrenfest criterion has been demonstrated in several ways .",
    "one way to see this is through the correction terms to ehrenfest s theorem .",
    "when the width of the state is small but not negligible , these corrections can be obtained as a series involving the variance and higher moments of the position probability distribution @xcite .",
    "this series has exactly the same form for the classical liouville probability distribution .",
    "hence ehrenfest s theorem merely asserts that if the ( quantum or classical ) probability distribution is sufficiently narrow , its centroid will follow a newtonian trajectory . to leading order ,",
    "the deviations from the newtonian trajectory are the same in both the quantum and classical cases , and so those deviations are not primarily quantal in origin .",
    "the magnitude of the deviations from ehrenfest s theorem depends primarily on the width of the initial state in configuration space , and has no systematic dependence on @xmath3 @xcite . however , the ( much smaller ) differences between the quantum and classical probabilities scale as @xmath1 , indicating that they are truly of quantal origin .",
    "our interest in hyperion was stimulated by zurek s provocative paper @xcite .",
    "he begins with an estimate of the break time , @xmath4 , beyond which the ehrenfest criterion of classicality will fail . since the width of a wave packet in a chaotic system grows exponentially with the lyapunov exponent @xmath5 , the time taken for it to reach the scale @xmath6 over which the potential varies ( typically of order of the system size ) will be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the initial width of the wave packet .",
    "zurek chooses @xmath9 , with the width of the momentum distribution @xmath10 being estimated from thermal fluctuations , and thereby obtains the now - familiar result that the break time @xmath4 scales as @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath4 can be quite short , even for a macroscopic system , and because of the logarithmic dependence , it is not sensitive to detailed assumptions about the initial state . thus , according to the ehrenfest criterion for classicality , the tumbling motion of hyperion should long ago have ceased to be classical .    this paradoxical conclusion is not affected by including environmental decoherence .",
    "decoherence converts a pure state into a mixed state , but it does not produce localization of the position probability density , and so it has no significant influence on the breakdown of ehrenfest s theorem .",
    "( indeed , the diffusive term that describes the effect of the environment in the master equation for the density matrix will have a slight delocalizing effect . ) therefore , if the ehrenfest criterion were the sole criterion for classicality , we would still be faced with the paradoxical conclusion that macroscopic bodies like hyperion should be grossly non - classical .    in @xcite",
    "zurek next considers the equation of motion of the wigner function , which has the form of the classical liouville equation plus a series of @xmath3-dependent terms , called the _",
    "moyal terms_. the limit of the liouville regime of classicality will presumably be reached when the moyal terms have a significant effect .",
    "unfortunately , zurek does not distinguish between the ehrenfest and liouville regimes , and denotes both break times as @xmath12 .",
    "this is a serious confusion , since they are both conceptually and numerically distinct .",
    "while the time limit @xmath4 of the ehrenfest regime is easy to estimate reliably , an analogous limit for the liouville regime is much more difficult to obtain .",
    "zurek uses heuristic arguments to claim that decoherence tends to counter the effects of the moyal terms , and he obtains a liouville break time similar in form to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we consider this conclusion to be doubtful for several reasons .",
    "habib et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that , in order for the non - negativity of the density matrix (  rho - positivity \" in their terminology ) to be preserved , the moyal terms must have subtle effects that are not counteracted by decoherence .",
    "full numerical computations for a driven system @xcite and for an autonomous system @xcite have found that , although the differences between quantum and classical averages of observables have a brief period of exponential growth , these differences reach a saturation value , about which they fluctuate irregularly .",
    "this saturation value is much smaller than the system size ( unlike the deviations from ehrenfest s theorem ) , and it tends to zero as some small power of @xmath3 .",
    "the break time estimated by zurek would be relevant only if the exponential growth of these qc differences continued until they reached macroscopic size .    in this paper",
    "we perform classical and quantum computations for the chaotic tumbling of an object like hyperion , which complement the published classical theory @xcite .",
    "the actual value of the de broglie wavelength is , of course , much too short to be treated in a numerical integration of the schrdinger equation .",
    "so we cast the equation into dimensionless form , and solve it for a range of the dimensionless @xmath3 parameter .",
    "these results lead to scaling relations , from which we can extrapolate to estimate the values appropriate to hyperion .",
    "we study the system with and without environmental decoherence , discuss the conditions needed to ensure classicality , as well as examine whether there is a qualtiative difference between the classical limit of regular and chaotic initial states .",
    "our model of hyperion s rotation was first suggested in 1988 by wisdom @xcite .",
    "it assumes that hyperion s center of mass travels in an elliptical orbit about saturn , and that its orbit is unaffected by its rotation .",
    "however , since hyperion is an extended object , saturn s gravitational field is not constant over its volume .",
    "since its mass distribution is not spherical , the variation in the gravitational field can produce a net torque .",
    "to lowest order in a multipole expansion of the mass distribution , this torque depends on the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution , and for simplicity we neglect all higher order moments .",
