    "@xmath159 denotes the fourier  transformed exchange coupling defined by @xmath160 for the undoped case ( @xmath161 ) the expression ( [ omegares1 ] ) exactly reproduces the result of linear spin - wave theory : @xmath162 the spin  wave energies for different hole concentrations calculated from ( [ omegares1 ] ) are shown in figs .  5 and 6 .    for an analytic discussion of the @xmath163-dependence of the spin  wave energy we calculate @xmath158 for fixed path coefficients @xmath144 and @xmath145 using approximations which are again equivalent to those of linear spin  wave theory .",

    "its solution can be inserted into ( [ omegares1 ] ) .",

    "note that terms with @xmath145 cancel each other .",
    "the next process renormalizing @xmath166 is expected to arise from @xmath167 which we neglect here .",
    "@xmath167 is small compared to @xmath144 , see sec .  iii . from this fact",
    "we expect that the error introduced by including only paths of length 0,1 , and 2 in the calculation of the spin  hole coupling is rather small",
    ".    to perform the expectation value in @xmath168 we need to know the momentum distribution of the hole quasiparticles .",
    "it is well established that the minimum energy of the quasiparticle dispersion is located at @xmath22 . as a simple approximation we neglect the effect of the fermi surface and assume that the momenta of all holes are @xmath22 , i.e. , all holes are in the centre of the hole pockets . in the following we are only interested in small momenta @xmath169 .",
    "the first non  trivial order of @xmath169 leads to @xmath170 inserting this into ( [ omegares2 ] ) we end up with the following approximation for the spin  wave energy at small momenta @xmath169 : @xmath171 the @xmath163dependence remains linear even upon doping . for @xmath172 the spin - wave energy @xmath166 goes to zero in accordance with goldstone s theorem .",
    "the spin  wave velocity @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) decreases with doping . at a critical hole density",
    "@xmath175 the spin - wave velocity vanishes .",
    "if we assume @xmath144 to be independent of the hole concentration and approximate @xmath176 we obtain @xmath177 @xmath178 denotes the spin  wave velocity in the undoped antiferromagnet . using realistic values @xmath106=5",
    ", @xmath144=1.25 we find @xmath175=4.0% .",

    "7 shows the calculated doping dependence of @xmath179 for @xmath107 .",
    "another important result to be seen in fig .",
    "5 is that the @xmath169-range , where we find a linear @xmath169-dependence of @xmath166 , becomes smaller with increasing hole concentration .",
    "this is also in agreement with experimental results , see e.g. rossat - mignod@xcite .",
    "note that the critical concentration @xmath147 where the magnetization vanishes is somewhat smaller than @xmath175 evaluated here . as already mentioned for @xmath107",
    "we have @xmath180 whereas @xmath181 .",
    "this is understandable since the softening of spin  wave excitations should first lead to the vanishing of the staggered magnetization .",
    "the cumulant formalism provides an alternative way to derive the expression ( [ omegares1 ] ) for the spin  wave energy . introducing a transverse wave vector dependent field in the hamiltonian one obtains the transverse static susceptibility by taking the second derivative of the ground state energy @xmath35 with respect to the field .",
    "the results for the static susceptibility allow for the calculation of spin  wave energies .",
    "the necessary link is given by the dynamical spin susceptibility .",
    "the calculation leads exactly to the same expression ( [ omegares1 ] ) for the spin - wave energy ( ! ) .",
    "the detailed derivation has been published in a recent paper@xcite .",
    "the static susceptibility for a staggered field shows a @xmath182divergency for all hole concentrations .",
    "this means that the calculation presented in sec .",
    "iv always describes a state with antiferromagnetic long  range order .",
    "the aim of this work was to study the hole and spin dynamics of weakly doped antiferromagnets described by the @xmath5-@xmath6 model . instead of using dynamical correlation functions our approach",
    "is based on the calculation of the ground  state energy and contains a static view of the system .    in the first part we have rederived the quasiparticle dispersion for one hole generated in the ground state at half  filling ( fig .",
    "the energy minima are found at @xmath22 in agreement with other analytical and numerical results . by neglecting hole  hole interaction the calculation can be extended to finite doping by use of a rigid  band approximation . for the fermi surface ( fig .",
    "3 ) we obtain the expected picture of hole ",
    "pockets around @xmath183 .",
    "the weakly doped system has been subject of the second part of this paper .",
    "we have presented results for the staggered magnetization and for spin  wave energies up to first order in @xmath2 . the staggered magnetization ( fig",
    ".  4 ) decreases with doping due to spin  hole interactions .",
    "the magnetization becomes zero at a hole concentration @xmath147 which indicates the disappearance of antiferromagnetic long  range order .",
    "the spin  wave energy is found to be also strongly renormalized with hole doping ( fig .  5 and 6 ) . both effects are coupled : due to decreasing spin ",
    "wave energies more long  wavelength spin fluctuations are mixed into the ground state which causes the loss of magnetization .",
    "the spin  wave velocity has a square  root concentration dependence ( fig .  7 ) and vanishes for a critical hole concentration @xmath175 given by ( [ spw_v ] ) .",
    "note that we find @xmath184 ( for instance , @xmath185 for @xmath107 ) , i.e. , the magnetization vanishes before the spin - wave velocity becomes zero .",
    "this feature was observed in experiments@xcite .",
    "the strong renormalization of the spin  wave energies due the presence of holes arises from the interaction of spin waves with spin fluctuations created by hole hopping .",
    "this can be interpreted as the decay of spin waves into particle ",
    "hole pairs .",
    "to first order in @xmath2 only the first path coefficient @xmath144 contributes to the renormalized spin  wave energy ( [ omegares2 ] ) .",
    "the destruction of the antiferromagnetic state therefore results from the creation and annihilation of additional spin waves by moving holes .",
    "the strength of this coupling increases with @xmath106 because the energy gain by hole hopping is of order @xmath5 while the energy loss due to a flipped spin is of order @xmath6 .",
    "realistic values for @xmath106 are between 3 and 5 which explains the high effectiveness of a small hole concentration for the destruction of antiferromagnetism .    in principle",
    "it should also be possible to discuss the influence of spin dynamics on the quasihole properties .",
    "however , the approximation of truncating the eigenvalue problem for the path coefficients after the third variable ( @xmath89 ) causes the loss of some features of the one  hole dispersion relation .",
    "this approximation leads to the fact that all momenta on the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone correspond to the same energy , i.e. , in this case the minima are no longer obtained at @xmath22 .",
    "it would be necessary at least to include also paths with a length of 4 . this would , however , lead to a more extensive calculation .",
    "the present calculations are only valid within the antiferromagnetic phase of the @xmath5-@xmath6 model at small doping concentrations .",
    "our starting point is the nel state which has long - range order .",
    "spin fluctuations are included by a perturbational method based on cumulants .",
    "note that the linear spin  wave approximation employed for calculating the expectation values becomes questionable for vanishing sublattice magnetization .",
    "therefore , the actual calculation can not provide a reliable description of the system in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition @xmath186 .",
    "especially properties of the critical point are not accessible .    in the present approach , even for higher doping",
    "the ground state has always a broken rotational symmetry .",
    "the divergency of the staggered susceptibility for small momenta@xcite @xmath187 shows that we always describe a system with antiferromagnetic long  range order . to extend our approach to systems with",
    "only short  range magnetic order will be the subject of future research .",
    "in this appendix we show how to evaluate cumulants with an exponential ansatz for the wave operator @xmath39 , compare ( [ kumver ] ) .",
    "the following identities are useful for transforming the set of non  linear equations ( [ kum2]@xmath51 into an eigenvalue problem .",
    "@xmath188 these relations hold for operators with @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 etc .",
    "they can be proven straighforwardly by expanding the exponentials , explicitely evaluating the cumulants and then recollecting all terms . to show this for the second identity we start from the definition of cumulant expectation values@xcite for a product of arbitrary operators @xmath192 @xmath193 here",
    "we have used @xmath194 . inserting this transformation in the original expression leads to @xmath195 in the third equation we have replaced the sum over @xmath196 by a sum over @xmath197 with @xmath198 .",
