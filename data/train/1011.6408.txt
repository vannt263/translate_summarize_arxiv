    "the formation and the evolution of galaxies are thought to be strongly dependent on their environments . as an extreme example of high - density environment",
    ", galaxy clusters may affect star formation activities of their member galaxies through various processes ( boselli & gavazzi 2006 ; park & hwang 2009 ) , including ram - pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ; abadi , moore , & bower 1999 ) , cluster tidal forces ( fujita 1998 ) , violent galaxy encounters ( lavery & henry 1994 ) , or rapid galaxy encounters such as galaxy harassment ( moore et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these mechanisms are attributed as the reasons why galaxy clusters show less star formation than field both at low and high redshifts ( e.g. , dressler & gunn 1983 ; poggianti et al . 1999 , 2009 ) .    to date ,",
    "a number of galaxy clusters are known to be in a merging process by their asymmetric x - ray emission and substructures in member distribution ( e.g. , markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ; donnelly et al .",
    "the effect of cluster - scale merging on the member galaxies is still being debated ( e.g. , hwang & lee 2009 ) : the cluster - cluster merging can trigger the star formation in member galaxies by driving the external potential ( e.g. , bekki 1999 ) , or quench the star formation by depriving gas via ram pressure of the intracluster medium ( e.g. , fujita et al . 1999 ) .",
    "both hypotheses are supported by observations , thus so far it is unclear which case is more dominant .",
    "abell 2255 ( hereafter a2255 ) is a rich galaxy cluster at low redshift ( @xmath8 ; struble & rood 1999 ) that consists of a few hundred member galaxies . due to its richness ( richness class 2 ; abell 1958 ) and the advantage of extensive membership studies ( cluster membership is determined partly using the spectroscopic redshifts from the sloan digital sky survey data release 2 , abazajian et al . 2004 ; and partly using the photometric redshifts by yuan , zhou , & jiang 2003 ) , the cluster is ideal for investigation of stellar populations and evolution of its member galaxies .",
    "previous studies based on various wavelengths  x - ray , optical , and radio  have suggested that a2255 is not a relaxed cluster , but in a process of cluster - cluster merging .",
    "the x - ray contour map is elongated in the east - west direction which implies that there was a merger in this direction ( davis & white 1998 ; feretti et al .",
    "since there are no distinct two peaks in the x - ray temperature distribution , it seems that a2255 is already in the late stage of cluster - cluster merger . optical member identification  using spectroscopic and photometric redshifts  shows that a2255 has several significant substructures with different velocity components @xcite .",
    "these substructures are interpreted as groups of galaxies infalling into the main cluster .",
    "radio observations revealed an excess of radio galaxies in a2255 @xcite , some of them being agn - dominated .",
    "@xcite found x - ray point sources in a2255 that are thought to be agns , and they also found that the total number of agns in a2255 is significantly larger than that of a typical galaxy cluster .",
    "finally , a possible alignment of star - forming galaxies that prefer a specific direction ( south - north ; miller & owen 2003 ) can also be interpreted as the result of cluster - cluster merger .",
    "all these observations support the idea that a2255 is a good example of an `` unrelaxed '' galaxy cluster .",
    "yuan et al.(2005 ) discussed the effects of cluster - cluster merging on the evolution of member galaxies using the sdss spectroscopy . from the morphological analysis",
    ", they suggested that the cluster - cluster merger has different effects on the star formation activity of galaxies with different morphologies : star formation activity is suppressed in e / s0 galaxies and enhanced in spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "however , this previous study on the star formation of member galaxies is limited to the optically bright galaxies with spectroscopic information .",
    "it is not clear whether these optically bright galaxies account for the majority of the star formation taking place in a2255 .",
    "firstly , there could be member galaxies that contribute significantly to the total ongoing star formation despite their faint magnitudes in optical .",
    "secondly , there could be a heavily obscured star formation that is not accounted for with the extinction correction estimated from the optical emission line ratios , as witnessed by recent infrared ( ir ) studies of the obscured star formation in the core of several clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , bai et al .",
    "2007 ; marcillac et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the mid - infrared ( mir ) emission is an efficient probes of these `` hidden '' star formation , since it is proportional to the total ir luminosity ( e.g. , chary & elbaz 2001 ) .",
    "the mir emission between 3 - 10@xmath0 m also plays an important role in detecting the existence of dust inside galaxies ( bressan et al .",
    "2007 ) , which provides hints to the evolution of galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we present 3 - 24@xmath0 m observation of @xmath9 arcmin@xmath10 over a2255 field using the ir telescope akari . by combining akari mir data with the optical / x - ray / radio data and _",
    "24/70@xmath0 m data , we study the properties of cluster member galaxies to investigate the effect of cluster - cluster merger on their evolution . in particular , we show that a significant fraction of cluster member galaxies have `` excess '' in mir with respect to the photospheric emission , i.e. emission from stellar photosphere .",
    "the mir - excess proves the presence of dust emission in these galaxies , which is an important sign of galaxy evolution .",
    "thus , we focus on these `` mir - excess '' galaxies and investigate their properties in relation to cluster dynamics , including cluster - cluster merger and infall .",
    "we present the mir and other ancillary data used in this study in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe how mir properties ( colors ) reflect the properties of a2255 member galaxies , and define the mir diagnostics to study galaxies of different levels of mir - excess . using the mir diagnostics",
    ", we derive the star formation rates of individual galaxies and the entire cluster in section 4 .",
    "in section 5 , we discuss the relation between the environmental parameters and the mir - excess galaxies .",
    "more detailed discussion suggesting the scenario of cluster - scale merging in a2255 is followed in sections 6 and 7 . throughout this paper",
    ", we use a cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 ( e.g. , i m , griffiths , & ratnatunga 1997 ) .",

    "clevl ( clusters of galaxies evolution studies ) is one of the mission programs of the akari ir telescope ( murakami et al . 2007 ) designed to understand the formation and the evolution of galaxies in cluster environments .",
    "the program is divided into three major components according to the redshifts of the targets  low - redshift , intermediate - redshift , and high - redshift clusters of galaxies .",

    "the irc consists of three cameras  nir band camera [ @xmath15 ] , mir - s band camera [ @xmath16 ] , and mir - l band camera [ @xmath17 ] , where the number next to each alphabet denotes the central wavelength of the filter . among these",
    ", nir and mir - s band cameras are placed to observe the same field of view ( fov ) on the sky , while mir - l band camera points to a different field separated by @xmath18 arcmin from the nir and mir - s field of view .",
    "the wide field of view ( @xmath14 arcmin@xmath10 ) and the continuous wavelength coverage at 3 - 24@xmath0 m are two main advantages of akari with respect to _ spitzer _ , in terms of study of galaxy clusters . for the clevl low - redshift cluster programs ,",
    "we used ` irc02 ` astronomical observation template ( aot ; see akari observer s manual ver 1.2 ) mode .",
    "this aot takes moderate - length exposure by using two filters for each camera .",

    ", we obtain all - filter coverage for the central four fields ( @xmath21arcmin@xmath10 ) .",
    "four fields in the south are covered only in @xmath22 and @xmath20 ( dashed line in figure [ fig : pointing ] ) , while four fields in the north are covered in @xmath23 ( solid line in figure [ fig : pointing ] ) .",
    "thus , the final data coverage with at least one akari filter is 1200arcmin@xmath10 .",
    "the on - source exposure time for each filter is roughly @xmath24seconds .",
    "the summary of the observation and the characteristics of the reduced images are specified in table [ tab : obs_summary ] .",
    "the images are reduced using the irc pipeline version 070104 ( y. ita , t. wada et al .",
    "2007 ; provided as a form of iraf external package ) .",
    "the irc pipeline consists of sky subtraction , astrometric calibration and final coaddition of individual frames . for the mir - l images whose astrometric calibration within the pipeline is relatively poor , we derive an astrometric solution using the iraf task ` ccmap ` using 2mass sources or @xmath25 images as a reference .",
    "the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the reduced images is between 4.0-@xmath26 , depending on the filter .",

    ", we make a reference image for source detection by combining images of different bands : for the photometry of @xmath30 through @xmath31 images , we use a @xmath23 combined image as a reference image . since the sensitivities in @xmath22 and @xmath20 images are relatively poor compared to the case of @xmath30-@xmath31 , we only combine l15 and l24 images to make a reference image for the photometry in @xmath29 bands .",
    "we perform dual - mode photometry using the reference images , with _ sextractor _",
    "configuration of ` detect_thresh`@xmath32 , ` detect_minarea`@xmath33 , and ` background ` mesh size of 32 pixels . as a measure of the total flux of each galaxy ,",
    "we use ` flux_auto ` from _ sextractor _ output , i.e. the flux within a kron elliptical aperture . the fluxes with a unit of adu",
    "are converted to @xmath34 in @xmath0jy , using the irc flux calibration table in the akari irc data users manual ver 1.4 ( 08/06/03 ; lorente et al .",
    "the `` dual - mode '' photometry we used in this paper is consistent with a `` single - mode '' photometry , which is a photometry performed on each image independently .",
    "the difference between the dual - mode photometry and the single - mode photometry is at most @xmath35% for each object .",
    "after the construction of the akari band - merged catalog , we matched the akari photometry catalog with catalogs of previously known cluster member galaxies . in order to identify the membership for a2255",
    ", we use the spectroscopic redshifts from the sdss data release 2 ( sdss dr2 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) and batc photometric redshifts by @xcite .",
    "yuan , zhou , & jiang ( 2003 ) constructed a cluster member catalog that consists of 214 spectroscopic members and 313 photometric members out to @xmath36mpc from the cluster center . since all the akari sources fall within the coverage of this catalog , we use yuan , zhou , & jiang ( 2003 ) s cluster member catalog ( hereafter the y03 catalog ) as a basis of our analysis in the following sections .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic targets are selected down to @xmath37 mag after correcting for galactic extinction ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) , therefore all members with spectroscopic redshifts are brighter than 17.77 mag in @xmath38-band .",
    "the completeness of the cluster member selection with spectroscopic redshifts at this magnitude range is on average @xmath39% , although it depends on the magnitudes and the clustercentric distances of the galaxies ( see fig . 1 in park & hwang 2009 ) .",
    "the addition of cluster members with photometric redshifts corrects this incompleteness .",
    "note that the number of member galaxies with photometric redshifts brighter than @xmath40 mag is 40 .",
    "the magnitude limit for the batc photometry is @xmath41 mag in each batc filter , and the batc photometric redshift identification is nearly complete for galaxies brighter than @xmath42 mag ( yuan , zhou , & jiang 2003 ) .",
    "this magnitude corresponds to @xmath43 - 18.9 mag for different types of galaxies ( c.f .",
    "galaxy colors in various photometric band systems ; fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , the cluster member selection is complete down to @xmath43 - 18.9 mag in terms of both the redshift identification and the member identification . above this limit",
    ", there are more than @xmath44 member galaxies with @xmath45 mag .",
    "we expect a significant incompleteness in cluster member selection for this magnitude range .",
    "although it is difficult to estimate the exact incompleteness at this faint end , this sample incompleteness would not cause much problem considering the relatively high mir detection limit compared to the optical limit .",
    "we describe the effect of the incompleteness on our analysis in more detail in section 4 ( also , please refer to figure [ fig : irlimit ] ) .",
    "the redshift cut for a2255 member galaxies is @xmath46 , and the median redshift of a2255 member galaxies is @xmath47 .",
    "the matching between the y03 catalog and the akari ir source catalog is done using a matching radius of @xmath48 ( roughly @xmath49fwhm radius of the akari n3 image , close to fwhm in other bands ) .",
    "we checked the optical and akari images of individual member galaxy to confirm that the matched object is not blended or mis - matched with neighboring sources .",
    "most ( @xmath50% ) of the member galaxies are not blended in mir . for 5% of galaxies that are suspected to be blended in mir , we assign ` @xmath51 ' value in the final photometry table ( table [ tab : phot ] ) .",

    "the inclusion of 24/70@xmath0m - detected galaxies increases the number of member galaxies detected in mir .",

    "it is well - known that cluster member galaxies show a clear red sequence in their color - magnitude relation defined by elliptical galaxies , reflecting the similar age and/or metallicity of galaxies ( e.g. , gladders et al .",
    "we investigate the color - magnitude relation of a2255 member galaxies at different wavelengths  optical , nir , and mir .",
    "figure [ fig : cmr ] represents the color - magnitude diagram of a2255 member galaxies in @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , from top to bottom .    in the optical and nir ( figures [ fig : cmr]a and [ fig : cmr]b ) , there is a tight sequence of galaxies in the color - magnitude diagram . in the optical color - magnitude diagram , a tight sequence made by bright , passively evolving member galaxies can be seen .",
    "the same sequence appears in @xmath38 vs. @xmath65 color - magnitude relation , but in a reversed way that the brighter galaxies having the bluer @xmath65 colors ( figure [ fig : cmr]b ) .",

    "all the member galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the non red - sequence category show nebular emission lines indicative of ongoing star formation , thus non red - sequence galaxies are thought to be star - forming galaxies while red - sequence galaxies are not .",

    "[ fig : cmr ] , circles indicate optical red - sequence galaxies and clovers indicate non red - sequence galaxies . while the optical red sequence is produced by galaxies with similar ages and metallicities , the same objects form a nir `` blue '' sequence since we are sampling the rayleigh - jeans tail of the black body radiation with the @xmath65 colors ( e.g. , lacy et al .",
    "2004 ; stern et al .",
    "in nir , the non red - sequence galaxies in the optical have the redder @xmath65 colors than the @xmath65 blue sequence  possibly due to the dust emission arising from star formation .",

    "not only galaxies that are outliers of @xmath66 blue sequence , but also galaxies in the blue sequence are considered to have `` mir - excess '' compared to the stellar continuum .",

    "the overplotted color tracks are calculated using models of elliptical galaxies with different ages and metallicities which include the dust emission from circumstellar dust around agb stars ( piovan , tantalo , & chiosi 2003 ) or spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates of local star - forming galaxies and ir luminous galaxies ( chary & elbaz 2001 ) .",

    "the complete limit for weak mir - excess galaxies is @xmath91 mag , and the limit for intermediate mir - excess galaxies is @xmath92 mag . sine our survey consists of fields covered with different filters having different depths , we take this different mir - excess fraction into account when discussing the spatial distribution of mir - excess galaxies ( section 5 ) .    table [ tab : mirx_fraction ] as well as figure [ fig : cmr ] show that the fraction of mir - excess galaxies is very high ( @xmath93% at @xmath67 mag , using s11 ) , contrary to the general belief that there are little dust and gas among cluster member galaxies .",
    "many of these mir - excess galaxies are on the optical red sequence ( weak and intermediate mir - excess galaxies ; see figure [ fig : cmr]c ) , so that it is essential to include agb circumstellar dust emission when describe the sed of red cluster galaxies from optical through mir ( bressan et al . 2007 ) .",

    "we find that the ages of the intermediate / weak mir - excess galaxies derived by the sed fitting correlate with the @xmath66 colors ( figure [ fig : mirx]a ) , with the spearman s rank correlation coefficient of @xmath103 . considering the degree of freedom at 38 ( n-2 , the number of points used is 40 ) , the correlation is reliable by more than 99.9% ( zar 1972 ) . the correlation is already expected by the model color tracks overplotted in figure [ fig : mirx]a . on the other hand ,",
    "there is little correlation between the metallicity and the @xmath66 color ( figure [ fig : mirx]b ; @xmath104 , consistent with null hypothesis ) .",
    "since the @xmath66 colors are more sensitive to age than metallicity , the mir - excess can be used to break the old age - metallicity degeneracies ( e.g. , ko et al . 2009 ) .",

    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient in this case is @xmath106 and @xmath107 , i.e. , significance level ( of the rejection of null hypothesis ) greater than 50% ( degree of freedom at 38 ) and 40% ( degree of freedom at 18 ) respectively .",
    "thus , the correlation between the mir color and h@xmath100 , d@xmath101(4000 ) is relatively weak .",
    "figure [ fig : ageindx ] illustrates the discrepancy between the different age indicators more clearly .",
    "the correlation coefficients between the sed - fitted age and age indicators are @xmath108 and @xmath109 for d@xmath101(4000 ) , @xmath66 , and h@xmath100 equivalent width respectively .",
    "these represent significance levels of smaller than 40% , larger than 99% , and smaller than 70% respectively .",
    "only @xmath66 shows reliable correlation with the stellar age derived through sed fitting .",
    "this implies that the estimation of mean stellar age is not an easy task .",
    "each age indicator has its pros and cons : h@xmath100 is known to be less sensitive to metallicity compared to a simple color index such as @xmath110 as viewed from the stellar population synthesis modelling , yet it is also easily affected by emission line component .",
    "d@xmath101(4000 ) is known to be a good tracer for young stellar age ( @xmath111gyr , d@xmath112 ; balogh et al .",
    "1999 ) , yet highly affected by metallicity for older age ( kauffmann et al .",
    "moreover , both h@xmath100 and d@xmath101(4000 ) is limited by the finite fiber size used for taking the sdss spectra ( @xmath113 diameter ) that only samples the central part of a galaxy if it is extended .",
    "we show morphologies of five galaxies with the mean stellar ages from the sed fitting younger than 5gyr ( figure [ fig : ageindx ] ) .",
    "most of the galaxies have outer disks and late - type morphology , and finite sdss fiber size sample only the central regions as indicated as @xmath113 bar in figure [ fig : ageindx ] .",
    "therefore , we address that mir - excess is a relatively good age indicator that is free of finite spectroscopic aperture , and age - metallicity degeneracy .    as the morphologies of 5 young galaxies ( @xmath35gyr ) suggests ( figure [ fig : ageindx ] ) , the fraction of late - type morphologies is large for `` intermediate '' mir - excess galaxies ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we examine the morphologies of a2255 member galaxies at the bright end ( @xmath92mag ; figure [ fig : morph ] ) , since the visual morphological classification becomes difficult at the fainter magnitudes .",
    "while 7 out of 7 strong mir - excess galaxies display late - type galaxy morphology , only 6 out of 25 ( 24% ) weak mir - excess galaxies show late - type morphology which can be easily understood as a consequence of the well - known correlation between color and morphology of galaxies . in the case of the intermediate mir - excess galaxies ( s171251.20 + 640423.0 and s171225.70 + 641946.0 in figure [ fig : morph ] and galaxies in figure [",
    "fig : ageindx ] ) , they show late - type morphology such as disks despite of being at the optical red sequence . the natural explanation of the colors and the morphologies of the intermediate mir - excess galaxies is that these galaxies are late - type galaxies with small amount of star formation , very possibly in the process of quenching of star formation . studying e@xmath114a galaxies ( i.e. , characterized with old stellar population and strong balmer absorption ) would be another way to see the truncation of star formation , yet we did not find any e@xmath114a galaxies using a criteria of ew(h@xmath115)@xmath116 ( goto 2007 , in addition to the criteria for no detectable [ oii ] and h@xmath117 emission lines ) among the member galaxies with the spectroscopic information .",
    "the intermediate mir - excess galaxies have on average ew(h@xmath115 ) of @xmath118 , with a typical measurement uncertainty of @xmath119 .",
    "only @xmath120% of the intermediate mir - excess galaxies are spectroscopically observed , thus it is not clear whether the remaining @xmath120% would be classified as e@xmath114a galaxies or not .",
    "this result demonstrates an advantage of using mir - excess in studying the transition population over optical spectra .",
    "the `` weakened '' star formation activity in intermediate mir - excess galaxies , regardless of its origin ( weak star formation or the agb - dust ) , is naturally explained by the idea that these galaxies are in the process of transformation from star - forming galaxies ( strong mir - excess galaxies ) to quiescent galaxies ( weak mir - excess galaxies ) at optical red sequence .",
    "the relation with these transformation and the cluster environment will be described in more detail in section 5.3 .",
    "active galactic nuclei cause mir - excess in galaxies ( quillen et al .",
    "1999 ) as well as ongoing star formation , thus alter the derived star formation rates of galaxies .",
    "the different diagnostics for agn , such as infrared color and optical line ratio , produce a significantly different result for demarcating agns and star - forming galaxies among mir - excess galaxies ( brand et al .",
    "therefore , we do not force to differentiate agns from our mir - excess galaxies in this paper .",
    "instead , we briefly discuss how many agns are included in mir - excess galaxies and how they affect our analysis and conclusion , using the previously known agns detected in either x - ray or radio , classified as agns using optical line diagnostics ( miller & owen 2003 ; davis , miller , & mushotzky 2003 ) .    in the akari/_spitzer _ field of view",

    ", agn contributes 3% of the star - forming galaxies , and 15% of the weak mir - excess galaxies .",
    "no agn cross - identification is found in intermediate mir - excess galaxies .",
    "the contribution from three seyfert galaxies to the total sfr is less than 5@xmath121 yr@xmath7 , i.e. less than 4% of @xmath122 ( see section 4.2 for details ) . with this little contribution",
    ", we conclude that our main analysis and conclusion is not affected by the presence of agns among mir - excess galaxies especially in the sense that we mainly discuss star - forming galaxies and intermediate mir - excess galaxies in a2255 .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , the strong mir - excess galaxies ( @xmath2 ) are galaxies with ongoing star formation . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how much star formation is hidden in ir ( e.g. , bai et al .",
    "2007 ) , and compare the total sfr of a2255 with those of other galaxy clusters too see if there is anything special in the star formation activity of a2255 .",
    "only galaxies with strong mir - excess are considered here for the sfr study , since sfrs in other classes of mir - excess galaxies are minimal , less than 0.1@xmath121 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we calculate sfrs of member galaxies from the derived ir luminosity through the sed fitting ( section 3.3 , figure [ fig : seds ] ) , and compare the sfr with those from other wavelengths .",
    "the total ir luminosities of a2255 member galaxies range from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , while the median value is @xmath125 .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath126 when converted using kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation between @xmath127 and sfr .",
    "however , considering the flux limits in mir and cluster member completeness limit in optical , the conservative limit in @xmath127 in our survey is @xmath128 ( figure [ fig : irlimit ] ) .",
    "we do not find any luminous ir galaxy ( lirg ; @xmath129 ) candidates in a2255 .",

    "the median amount of extinction in h@xmath117 is @xmath137 mag ( figure [ fig : sfr_extinct]b ) .",
    "there is a weak correlation between sfr and @xmath138 , i.e. galaxies with larger sfr having larger a(@xmath134 ) .",
    "we also compare the uv - derived sfr with the ir - derived sfr ( figure [ fig : sfr_extinct]c ) , using the galex nuv flux as a measure of sfr@xmath139 . as in the case of h@xmath117",

    "both the h@xmath117- and the uv - derived sfrs agree with the ir - derived sfr when corrected properly for the internal dust extinction , albeit with a large scatter ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "finally in figure [ fig : sfr_extinct]e , we present the comparison between sfr@xmath143 and sfr@xmath146 using 1.4ghz flux in miller & owen ( 2003 ) . the conversion formula from 1.4ghz flux to sfr@xmath146 is adopted from bell ( 2003 ) . although the number of the matched member galaxies is small , sfrs from the two indicators differ by about a factor of two , with the sfr@xmath143 being systematically larger than sfr@xmath146 .",
    "overall , we find a conventional extinction correction to the dust extinction works roughly well for estimating sfrs in individual galaxies ( e.g. , choi et al .",
    "2006 ) , but such correlations accompany large scatters .",
    "therefore , we consider the usage of the ir data is a robust way to derive the star formation compared to uv and the optical data .      in this section , we derive the global properties of star formation activity in a2255 , in order to examine if the merging activity enhanced the star formation activity of a2255 in particular .",

    "the spectroscopic redshifts are obtained from sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al .",

    "the large scale analysis shows strong redshift peak at @xmath187 which can be attributed to the presence of a2255 and the nep supercluster . on the other hand , in the central region within the clustercentric distance of 2mpc ,",
    "the redshift distribution is far different from a single gaussian distribution : the possibility that the distribution of galaxies located within the central 2mpc follow a single gaussian function is only 40% by kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "instead , the redshift distribution is well described by a sum of two redshift components with @xmath188 and @xmath189 , with the lack of galaxies being at @xmath187 .",
    "figure [ fig : largescale]b , c , d , and e show the spatial distribution of galaxies at different redshift bins .",
    "the galaxies at the blue velocity component ( b ; @xmath190 ) and the red velocity component ( d ; @xmath191 ) are concentrated in the cluster center .",
    "the redshift range of @xmath192 , where only few of a2255 cluster members reside in , consists of galaxies that are distributed like a flat sheet at @xmath187 ( figure [ fig : largescale]c ) . at the reddest velocity tail ( e ; @xmath193 ) , galaxies are distributed along a filamentary structure that pass through a2255 .",
    "the two velocity groups ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) are virtually superimposed in the sky .",
    "the velocity dispersion of two groups are 800 km s@xmath7 ( blue ) and 500 km s@xmath7 ( red ) . using simple virial theorem , the masses of each component are @xmath194 ( blue ) and @xmath195 ( red ) when virial radius is 2mpc for each group . according to the criteria for gravitationally bounded two - body problem ( beers , geller , & huchra 1982 ; tran et al .",
    "2005 ) , the probability that these two components are gravitationally bounded is when the following equation is satisfied .",
    "@xmath196    in this equation , @xmath197 is the relative velocity between the two groups ( 1500 km s@xmath7 ) , @xmath198 is the projected separation ( less than @xmath44kpc since two components are nearly superimposed ) , @xmath199 is the total mass of the system and @xmath117 is the projected angle with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "the equation is valid for the projection angle range of @xmath200 , thus the probability that the two groups are bounded is more than 90% .",
    "therefore , a2255 is clearly thought to be `` merging '' galaxy cluster with two different velocity peaks .",

    "figure [ fig : env_ssfr]b shows how ssfr changes as a function of local galaxy surface density , @xmath172 .",
    "previous works of intermediate redshift clusters suggested that ssfr is enhanced at the intermediate density region of clusters and the enhanced activity is related to infall of galaxies into the gravitational potential of clusters ( e.g. , koyama et al .",

    ", we find that there is no clear enhancement of ssfr from surface density of @xmath202mpc@xmath182 .",
    "there is a slight increase in lower density region , at @xmath203mpc@xmath182 , yet the amount of difference is less than a factor of 1.5 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that star formation is not enhanced in dense regions of a2255 .",
    "we also examine if star formation activities are enhanced at substructures as suggested from studies of other clusters ( e.g. , koyama et al .",
    "figure [ fig : env_ssfr]c shows the average ssfr for the substructures identified in section 5.1 , in comparison to galaxies in the other areas of the cluster .",
    "errors for the average ssfr are the standard deviations of ssfr distribution for each case .",
    "we find that there is little difference between the average ssfr of galaxies in substructures ( sub ) and not in substructures ( n ) .",
    "several substructures ( a , w , and y ) contain very few star - forming galaxies and the average ssfrs are low . from this , we conclude that ssfr is not particularly enhanced in substructures even if some galaxies in substructures show high ssfr compared to global average .",
    "although we find no convincing evidence for the enhancement of ssfr at a particular environment ( except that ssfrs are higher at the outer region ) , we find an interesting trend in the distribution of star - forming galaxies in the inner region .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : spatial_sf]c , the redshift distribution of star - forming galaxies ( filled histogram ) is bimodal : a blue velocity peak at @xmath204 and a red velocity peak at @xmath205 ( note that this analysis is only possible for samples with spectroscopic redshifts since the accuracy of photometric redshifts is too low ) . at @xmath206mpc ,",
    "the majority of galaxies with high ssfr belong to the blue velocity peak .",
    "we show the average ssfr of galaxies at the blue velocity peak and at the red velocity peak in figure [ fig : env_ssfr]a .",
    "figure [ fig : env_ssfr]a indicates that the average ssfr of galaxies at the blue velocity peak ( @xmath207 ) is higher than that of galaxies at the red velocity peak ( @xmath208 ) by a factor of @xmath36 , at the innermost region with @xmath206mpc . by randomly selecting and assigning galaxies at @xmath206mpc to either blue or red peaks , we find that the chance probability of finding this observed difference in the average ssfr is less than 5% .",
    "this trend appears to continue out to @xmath209mpc , but the trend is not statistically significant compared to what we found at @xmath206mpc .",
    "as we discussed in section 3.4 , intermediate mir - excess galaxies are probes of galaxy transformation from star - forming galaxies ( strong mir - excess ) to quiescent galaxies ( weak mir - excess ) . by studying the environment of intermediate mir - excess galaxies ,",
    "we can gain insight on where in the cluster the galaxy transformation is taking place and what physical mechanisms govern the transformation .",
    "the two - dimensional spatial distribution of weak / intermediate mir - excess galaxies is plotted in figures [ fig : spatial_ell]a and b. the plots show that weak mir - excess galaxies populate near the cluster center , while intermediate mir - excess galaxies prefer @xmath210mpc .",
    "we show the trend in a more quantitative way in figure [ fig : env_mirx ] , by presenting the number ratios of galaxies with different levels of mir - excess as a function of the environmental parameters .",

    "figure [ fig : env_mirx]b illustrates the same number ratio as a function of the local galaxy surface density .",
    "these are clearer form of figure [ fig : env ] , showing the relative fraction of strong / intermediate / weak mir - excess galaxies as a function of environment , with emphasis on the weak and intermediate mir - excess galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : env]b and d clearly shows that the weak mir - excess galaxies dominate at the highest densities , and the strong mir - excess galaxies dominate at the lowest densities .",
    "the intermediate mir - excess galaxies start to show up at around @xmath211mpc@xmath182 ( @xmath212mpc ) , but their number disappears quickly at @xmath213mpc@xmath182 ( @xmath214mpc ) .",
    "the relative fraction of intermediate mir - excess to weak mir - excess galaxies is the highest at the similar density/@xmath177 , @xmath215mpc@xmath182 and @xmath216mpc ( figure [ fig : env_mirx]a , b ) . from this",
    ", we conclude that galaxies in transformation ( as represented by intermediate mir - excess galaxies ) populate the intermediate density regions ( or the clustercentric distance of @xmath217mpc ) .",
    "this clustercentric radius corresponds to @xmath218 , which exactly coincides with the location in clusters where the ram pressure stripping is known to be efficient in quenching the star formation in galaxies by stripping their gas reservoir based on the sphere of influence argument ( treu et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "like in case of star - forming galaxies , a significant number of intermediate mir - excess galaxies have redshifts at blue velocity component ( figure [ fig : env_mirx]a ) . the difference with in the case of star - forming galaxies",
    "is that intermediate mir - excess galaxies at blue velocity peak are located at @xmath219mpc .",
    "we also examine the correlation between substructures and the fraction of intermediate mir - excess galaxies ( figure [ fig : env_mirx]c ) . like in the case of star - forming galaxies",
    ", there is no clear evidence that intermediate mir - excess galaxies are preferentially located in the substructures .",
    "note that however , as we mentioned in 3.2 , the observation of mir - excess galaxies is limited by the depth of mir images  especially at weak / intermediate mir - excess for regions without @xmath31-band coverage .",
    "the substructures b , c , d , and e are such substructures , thus the reason we do nt see weak / intermediate mir - excess galaxies in these substructures may due to the shallow depth of the 24@xmath0 m image .",
    "most of the galaxies in substructures b , c , d , and e have @xmath38-band magnitude of @xmath220 mag , therefore only objects with @xmath221 m @xmath222 , i.e. close to strong mir - excess galaxies can be detected as intermediate mir - excess galaxies .",
    "the mir data presented so far invoke several interesting points regarding the evolution of galaxies in a cluster environment like a2255 , i.e. how cluster - scale dynamics correlates with the evolution of individual member galaxies . in section 4.2 , we show that the total sfr of a2255 is comparable with that of other galaxy clusters of similar mass and dynamical stage , which implies that the cluster - scale merging activity in a2255 does not enhance the star formation activity of member galaxies to the level of galaxies in some of the active clusters at intermediate redshifts .",
    "there is no clear evidence that substructures are closely associated with galaxies with high ssfr ( section 5.2 , figure [ fig : env_ssfr]c ) .",
    "star - forming galaxies are located at the outer part of the cluster ( @xmath210mpc ) or blue / red end of the velocity distribution ( figure [ fig : spatial_sf]a , b ) . while the dynamical status of a2255 is considered to be `` post - merger '' from the previous x - ray observations  no distinct multiple temperature peak , the temperature gradient elongated in east - west direction ( davis , miller , & mushotzky 2003 )  , our results are consistent with no enhancement of star formation related to the cluster merger .",
    "this result is at odds with conclusions put forward in previous studies .",
    "miller & owen ( 2003 ) suggested that the fraction of radio selected star - forming galaxies are twice larger in a2255 compared to other galaxy clusters including coma cluster .",
    "they referred this `` enhanced '' star formation in a2255 to the cluster - cluster merger , arguing that the alignment of star - forming galaxies in the north - south direction is a product of cluster - cluster merging in east - west direction .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , we do not find such an alignment of star - forming galaxies nor more active star formation than the coma cluster .",
    "the discrepancy between their and our results can be understood as the following .",
    "our mir observation discover more star - forming galaxies in a2255 than miller & owen ( 2003 ) , since we are probing the sfr much deeper than their sfr detection limit of @xmath223 yr@xmath7 .",
    "all the radio - selected star - forming galaxies in miller & owen ( 2003 ) are detected in mir if they are within either the akari or the _ spitzer _ fields .",
    "on the other hand , a number of strong mir - excess galaxies having comparable sfr with radio - selected star - forming galaxies are not detected in radio .",
    "therefore we conclude that the difference between the mir study and the radio study arises from the way how star - forming galaxies are selected , and that the effect of the environment on star formation activities requires a deep , multi - wavelength data not to miss galaxies with moderate sfr . in another work ,",
    "yuan et al.(2005 ) suggested that cluster - cluster merging in a2255 had different effect on star - forming galaxies with different morphologies , i.e. sfrs of late - type galaxies increase towards the center and the sfrs of the early - type galaxies decrease towards the center using the sfr measured in optical spectroscopy , concluding that the cluster - cluster merging activity triggered star formation in the central region of the cluster .",
    "however , our study shows no marked increase in the ssfr of galaxies near the cluster center .",
    "furthermore , star - forming galaxies near the cluster center are found to have significantly blueshifted radial velocities with respect to the cluster mean redshift whose origin is discussed in more detail below .",
    "we can gain another valuable insight on the galaxy evolution in a merging cluster from the velocity distribution of mir - excess galaxies . in sections 5.2 and 5.3 , we noted on a high fraction of star - forming galaxies and intermediate mir - excess galaxies in the blue velocity peak and the lack of star - forming galaxies with high ssfr at the redshift peak especially at @xmath206mpc .",
    "we discuss here how this interesting tendency can arise .",
    "a simulation performed by fujita et al.(1999 ) of a merging cluster illustrates how galaxies in the merging cluster evolve as the merging of the clusters proceed .",
    "according to their work , the merging activity increases the ram - pressure , causing a more efficient stripping of gas from galaxies in the cluster , hence causing a quenching of star formation rather than enhancement of the star formation .",
    "but at the same time , their simulation indicates that some cluster galaxies associated with the merging can survive the ram - pressure stripping and maintain their blue colors if their relative velocities to the cluster center are high , simply because they pass through the cluster too fast for the ram - pressure to quench the star formation . due to this effect ,",
    "the relative velocities of blue galaxies are larger than those of red galaxies by about @xmath224 km s@xmath7 in a merging cluster at 3.6 gyr after the core - crossing .",
    "the outcome of the simulation matches well with our results ",
    "i.e. , no particular enhancement of star formation activities and the peculiar distribution of strong / intermediate mir - excess galaxies that are found preferentially at the blue velocity peak .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the discovery of the preferential occupation of the blue velocity peak by strong / intermediate mir - excess galaxies is a supporting evidence of the galaxy transformation taking place in a merging cluster following the picture presented in fujita et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "these key findings allow us to draw a global picture of the galaxy evolution process taking place in a2255 .",
    "as witnessed from the strong / intermediate mir - excess galaxies at the blue velocity peak and the lack of notable enhancement of star formation both globally in the cluster and in substructures , the cluster - cluster merging suppresses the star formation activity with the ram - pressure stripping rather than enhancing it .",
    "the quenching of star formation is happening in two folds , one related to the cluster - cluster merging , and another related to the ram - pressure stripping of gas in ( infalling ) galaxies at @xmath225 where the supporting evidence comes from the spatial distribution of intermediate mir - excess galaxies and the lack of star - forming galaxies at @xmath206mpc .",
    "we investigated the mir properties of galaxies in a merging cluster a2255 using the akari mir observation over 3 - 24@xmath0 m in addition to the _ spitzer _ mips 24 , 70@xmath0 m data , in order to understand the ongoing sfr activities in such a cluster , and the role of the environment on the subsequent evolution of the star - forming galaxies into red , quiescent galaxies .    as a way to trace the evolutionary sequence of galaxies from the star - forming stage through the transition stage to the dead , quiescent stage",
    ", we examined the mir colors ( @xmath66 or @xmath221 m ) of the cluster member galaxies .",
    "we found that mir colors of the cluster galaxies show a large dispersion unlike the tight red of blue sequences in the optical or nir color - magnitude relation .",
    "virtually almost all ( @xmath226% ) of the member galaxies with mir detection have redder @xmath66 colors than the expectation from stellar photospheric emission only .",
    "the mir - excess can be categorized in three classes according to @xmath66 ( or @xmath221 m ) color ; the first is a population of galaxies forming a blue sequence at @xmath227 ( `` weak '' mir - excess ) that can be considered as a coeval population with the dust emission coming from the circumstellar dust around agb stars .",
    "the second case is a population with a `` strong '' mir - excess ( @xmath81 ) , most of which are star - forming galaxies with blue optical colors .",
    "the third case is an `` intermediate '' mir - excess population ( @xmath5 ) which lie between the weak and the strong mir - excess galaxies .",
    "these are mostly passive galaxies with young mean stellar age . as such , the mir color works as a classifier of galaxies at different stages of evolution .",
    "the intermediate mir - excess galaxies have late - type morphology ( @xmath228% ) , while the weak mir - excess galaxies are predominantly early - type ( @xmath228% ) .",
    "the strong mir - excess galaxies are mostly late - type galaxies .",
    "the morphologies of the different mir - excess classes support the idea that the intermediate mir - excess galaxies are the transition population bridging the strong and the weak mir - excess galaxies .",
    "armed with the three different classes of mir - excess galaxies which trace different stages of the galaxy evolution , we addressed whether the star formation is enhanced in the merging cluster or not , and how the environment affects the galaxy transition . using star - forming galaxies",
    "as represented by strong mir - excess galaxies , we derived the total sfr of a2255 .",
    "the ir luminosities of individual galaxies range @xmath229 , with the total sfr for entire cluster being @xmath6 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the integrated sfr , and the ir luminosity function of a2255 is consistent with those of other galaxy clusters at similar redshifts and with similar masses .",
    "this supports the idea that cluster scale dynamics ( cluster - cluster merging ) does not enhance the star formation activity .",
    "yet , it should be noted that most available galaxy clusters studied to date are biased to dynamically unrelaxed systems as a2255 .",
    "we identify substructures and two distinct velocity components ( the blue velocity peak and the red velocity peak ) in a2255 . to understand how large scale ( cluster - cluster ) and small scale ( group / galaxy infall ) merging activities affect the galaxy evolution , the star formation and its quenching of mir - excess galaxies were examined in these distinct components in a2255 as well as a function of the cluster - centric distance and the local density .",
    "star - forming galaxies are not only preferentially located in the outer , lower density part of the cluster , but also found to be more abundant in the blue velocity peak .",
    "the latter fact has been predicted in simulations of merging cluster , where galaxies in a highest velocity component suffer less quenching from the ram - pressure stripping .",
    "no marked increase in the specific star formation is found over the cluster region .",
    "the relative fraction of intermediate mir - excess galaxies increases at the intermediate density region or at regions with cluster - centric distance of 0.5 - 2.0mpc , suggesting that quenching in star formation occurs over such a region where the ram - pressure stripping has been speculated to be a main star formation suppression mechanism .",
    "these findings supports idea that the cluster - scale merging suppresses the star formation and the ram - pressure stripping is a main mechanism of the star formation quenching in a2255 .",

    "<S> we present the mid - infrared ( mir ) observation of a nearby galaxy cluster , abell 2255 by the akari space telescope . using the akari s continuous wavelength coverage between 3 - 24@xmath0 m and the wide field of view , we investigate the properties of cluster member galaxies to see how the infall of the galaxies , the cluster substructures , and the cluster - cluster merger influence their evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the excess of mir ( @xmath1 m ) flux is a good indicator to discriminate galaxies at different evolutionary stages , and divide galaxies into three classes accordingly : strong mir - excess ( @xmath2 ) galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star - forming galaxies , weak mir - excess ( @xmath3 ) galaxies that are quiescent , old ( @xmath4gyr ) galaxies where the mir emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dust around agb stars , and intermediate mir - excess ( @xmath5 ) galaxies in between the two classes that are less than a few gyrs old past the prime star formation activity . with the mir - excess diagnostics , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how local and cluster - scale environments affect the individual galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the total star formation rate and the specific star formation rate of a2255 using the strong mir - excess galaxies . the dust - free , total star formation rate of a2255 is @xmath6 yr@xmath7 , which is consistent with the star formation rates of other clusters of galaxies at similar redshifts and with similar masses . </S>",
    "<S> we find no strong evidence that supports enhanced star formation neither inside the cluster nor in the substructure region , suggesting that the infall or the cluster merging activities tend to suppress the star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate mir - excess galaxies , representing galaxies in transition from star - forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies , are located preferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures with higher surface density of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star - forming galaxies into red , quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core which can be well - explained by the ram - pressure stripping as previous simulation results suggest . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the cluster merging and the group / galaxy infall suppress the star formation and transform galaxies from star - forming galaxies into quiescent galaxies , most likely due to ram - pressure stripping . </S>"
