    "the advances in the nanotechnology make it possible to produce small quantum dots with desired controllable properties .",
    "the analogy between such a system and an atom has proved to be quite close @xcite . since however",
    "no natural restrictions for choosing the control parameters exist , the quantum dots may show new properties that we can not obtain from studies on atoms .",
    "for example , fano resonances have been observed experimentally in quantum dots @xcite , and the fano parameters may be complex @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the fano parameter expresses the interference between the resonant part of the transmission and a smooth ( direct ) nonresonant part .",
    "it is real when the resonance part is caused by the existence of an isolated resonance state @xcite as it is the case usually in atoms .",
    "when however the resonant part itself results from the interference of , e.g. , two neighboring resonance states , the fano parameter becomes complex @xcite . the same may appear in a cavity due to the absorption at the walls @xcite .",
    "further , it has been stated @xcite that the line shape of a fano resonance may be affected by some dephasing @xcite that may be caused by intrinsic sources ( e.g. , from electron - electron interactions ) as well as by extrinsic sources ( e.g. , radiation , magnetic impurities ) @xcite . for a quantitative study , the phase rigidity @xcite @xmath5 has been introduced that characterizes the degree to which the wave function @xmath6 is really complex ( the phase @xmath7 arises from a transformation so that re@xmath8 and im@xmath8 are orthogonal ) .",
    "an experimental and theoretical study @xcite showed that the two different mechanisms , dephasing and dissipation , are equivalent in terms of their effect onto the evolution of fano resonance line shapes .",
    "another interesting observation in the experimental results on quantum dots @xcite is that , as a function of the gate voltage that controls the transparencies of the point contacts , the widths of the observed resonances behave non - monotonic .",
    "the conductance peaks start as narrow breit - wigner resonances when the quantum dot is pinched off , then widen as the contacts are opened into resonances exhibiting the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "as the contacts are opened further , the resonances become more narrow and have the fano form with some background conductance .",
    "a similar result is obtained in a study on a tunable microwave scattering device @xcite . the explanation given in ref .",
    "@xcite is that diffraction at the contacts to the quantum dots is strongest at intermediate point contact transparencies , leading to large sticking probabilities .",
    "the non - monotonic increase of resonance widths as a function of the degree of opening the system is however a typical feature of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it was found first in theoretical nuclear reaction studies by using the formalism of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath9 @xcite , then in atoms @xcite and in microwave cavities @xcite where it is proven experimentally @xcite .",
    "also the transmission through a double quantum dot is studied as a function of the coupling strength between dot and attached leads @xcite . in the theoretical studies ,",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the resonance widths is caused by the width bifurcation that may appear at the avoided crossings of resonance states in the complex energy plane .",
    "further studies of open quantum systems showed that the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfunctions of @xmath9 evolve more or less independently from one another in the avoided level crossing scenario @xcite and that long - range correlations occur between the different states of the system @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian used in the random matrix interpolation between the standard ensembles with real and complex matrix elements , is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real and complex random hermitian matrices , respectively , and @xmath13 is a crossover parameter @xcite .",
    "for such an ensemble , the eigenvector elements acquire correlations between the elements of the same eigenvector @xcite and between different eigenvectors @xcite . for individual systems , such a crossover",
    "may be observed already in a billiard with only two attached waveguides @xcite .",
    "the wave functions in the cross - over regime show long - range correlations @xcite like the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "these long - range correlations of the wave functions in the real - to - complex crossover have recently been measured in an open microwave billiard @xcite .",
    "thus , the results obtained experimentally and theoretically for the profile of the transmission peaks , for the intensity fluctuations and also for the long - range correlations of the wave functions point to the fact that the system through which the transmission occurs may be essentially different from the original closed quantum system without attached leads .",
    "the differences arise from the interaction of neighboring resonance states via the continuum of scattering states . in quantum dots",
    ", these differences can be traced experimentally by varying the gate voltage that controls the transparencies of the point contacts .    in the following",
    ", we will study the phases of the eigenfunctions of the effective hamiltonian in the avoided level crossing scenario in detail .",
    "we will show that they are not fixed but vary due to the mutial influence of neighboring resonance states . in this spirit",
    ", a neighboring resonance state causes some `` perturbation '' for the considered state which is similar to that caused by an impurity .",
    "there is however an important difference between these two cases .",
    "in contrast to the perturbation by an impurity , the mutial interaction between neighboring states can not be avoided .",
    "it is an internal property of an open quantum system in the regime of overlapping resonances .    in sect .",
    "ii , we repeat some general properties of the interplay between the internal and external interaction in an open quantum system .",
    "while the internal interaction is of standard type , the external interaction occurs additionally via the common continuum of scattering wave functions .",
    "the amplitude for the transmission through a quantum dot will also be given .",
    "it is resonant in relation to the effective hamiltonian @xmath9 of the open quantum system .",
    "then we define the phase rigidity @xmath2 of the eigenfunctions @xmath0 of @xmath9 .",
    "further , we consider the scattering wave functions @xmath4 being solutions of @xmath15 in the total function space .",
    "in the interior of the system , the @xmath4 can be represented by the @xmath0 and , as a consequence , the phase rigidity @xmath3 of the scattering wave functions @xmath4 is related to that of the eigenfunctions @xmath0 . in sect .",
    "iii , we provide numerical results for the relation between transmission and phase rigidity @xmath3 of the scattering wave functions for three special cases .",
    "the results are summarized and some conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the relation between a closed and the corresponding open quantum system is as follows .",
    "a closed quantum system is described by a hermitian hamilton operator @xmath16 the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of which contain the internal interaction @xmath17 of the discrete states .",
    "when embedded into the common continuum of scattering states , the discrete eigenstates of the closed system turn over into resonance states with a finite lifetime .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath9 of the open quantum system contains @xmath16 as well as an additional term @xcite that describes the coupling of the resonance states to the common environment , @xmath18 here @xmath19 stand for the coupling matrix elements between the _ eigenstates _ of @xmath16 and the environment that may consist of different continua @xmath20 , e.g. the scattering waves propagating in the left ( @xmath21 ) and right ( @xmath22 ) leads attached to a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "they are described by the hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath9 is non - hermitian , its eigenvalues @xmath24 and eigenfunctions @xmath0 contain the external interaction @xmath25 of the resonance states via the continuum ( @xmath25 is used here instead of the concrete values @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) . while @xmath17 causes level repulsion in energy ,",
    "@xmath25 is responsible for the bifurcation of the widths of the resonance states .",
    "as long as @xmath28 , the spectroscopic properties of the open system are similar to those of the corresponding closed system .",
    "the lifetimes ( widths ) of the resonance states are , as a rule , comparable in value , i.e. the states exist at the same time and can influence one another .",
    "usually , the states avoid crossing in the complex energy plane in a similar manner as it is well known from the avoided crossings of the discrete states of a closed system . when however @xmath29 , the resonance states do no longer exist at the same time due to their different lifetimes owing to widths bifurcation @xcite .",
    "they do not cross therefore in the complex energy plane .",
    "most interesting is the situation @xmath30 .",
    "the interplay between @xmath17 and @xmath25 may cause unexpected and even counterintuitive results such as the non - monotonic dependence of the resonance widths on the degree of opening the system @xcite .    since the effective hamiltonian @xmath9 depends explicitely on the energy @xmath31 , so do its eigenvalues @xmath24 .",
    "the energy dependence is weak , as a rule , in an energy interval that is determined by the width of the resonance state .",
    "the solutions of the fixed - point equations @xmath32 and of @xmath33 are numbers that coincide approximately with the poles of the @xmath34 matrix .",
    "the width @xmath35 determines the time scale characteristic of the resonance state @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitude for the transmission through a quantum dot is @xcite @xmath37 where the scattering wave functions in the leads are denoted by @xmath38 . according to ( [ trheff ] ) ,",
    "the transmission is _ resonant _ in relation to @xmath9 . in ( [ trheff ] ) ,",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath24 with their full energy dependence are involved .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath0 of @xmath9 are complex and biorthogonal , @xmath39 the value @xmath40 is a measure for the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions @xmath0 of @xmath9 and for their phase rigidity ,  @xmath41 .",
    "it is large for an isolated resonance state at the energy @xmath42 , where the transmission probability has a peak . in the regime of overlapping resonance states however , where avoided level crossings appear @xcite , @xmath2 is usually small .",
    "approaching a branch point in the complex energy plane where two eigenvalues @xmath43 and @xmath44 coalesce , we have @xcite @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and further @xmath47 here , the widths bifurcate : with further increasing @xmath25 , one of the states aligns with a scattering state ( channel wave function @xmath48 or @xmath49 in the one - channel transmission ) and becomes short - lived while the other one becomes long - lived .",
    "for large @xmath25 , we have therefore only one long - lived resonance state and , as for non - overlapping resonance states , @xmath50 at the energy @xmath51 of the long - lived state .",
    "the scattering wave function @xmath52 is solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath53 in the total function space that consists of the discrete states of the quantum dot and of the scattering states @xmath38 in the attached leads .",
    "@xmath54 is hermitian .",
    "the solution reads @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56\\phi_\\lambda ( r ) $ ] is the wave function of the resonance state @xmath36 . according to ( [ total ] )",
    ", the eigenfunctions @xmath57 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath9 give the main contribution to the scattering wave function @xmath58 in the interior of the cavity .",
    "here , @xmath59    according to the relation ( [ total1 ] ) , the phase rigidity @xmath3 of the scattering wave function , eq . ( [ rig1 ] ) , is generally determined to the values of the phase rigidity @xmath2 of the individual resonance states @xmath36 . while @xmath2 characterizes the phase rigidity of the special resonance state @xmath36 , @xmath3 contains the @xmath2 from the different states that contribute to the scattering wave function @xmath4 in the considered energy region .",
    "this difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 is illustrated best by the following example .",
    "approaching a branch point in the complex energy plane , the contributions to ( [ total1 ] ) from the two states @xmath36 and @xmath60 with the relation ( [ nl5 ] ) of their wave functions to each other , cancel each other .",
    "the phase rigidity @xmath3 of the scattering wave function is determined therefore by the contributions of other states that , as a rule , are relatively far from one another .",
    "that means , in spite of @xmath61 , @xmath62 might be large at the branch point .",
    "we mention that the scattering wave function ( [ total1 ] ) has a similar structure as the transmission amplitude ( [ trheff ] ) .",
    "both expressions consist of a sum over overlapping resonance states with the weight factor @xmath63 .",
    "we expect therefore some correlation between both values .",
    "this relation , being trivial for isolated resonances , is of special interest in the regime of overlapping resonances .",
    "the transmission may be large not only at the positions @xmath64 of the resonance states @xmath36 as in the case of isolated resonances .",
    "it may be enhanced in a larger energy region when @xmath65 , i.e. when some states @xmath36 are ( partly ) aligned with the scattering states @xmath38 so that @xmath66 for them .",
    "in such a case , the matrix elements @xmath67 may be large not only at @xmath64 but in a larger energy region . for illustration",
    ", we will provide in the following section some numerical results for @xmath68 and @xmath62 for two model quantum billiards with a small number of states the transmission through which is studied earlier , and for a realistic chaotic quantum billiard .",
    "the correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the overlapping regime can clearly be seen in all cases .",
    "for illustration , let us first consider the relation between the degree of resonance overlapping and the phase rigidity in the transmission through a 1d - system , see fig .",
    "the widths of the states in the middle @xmath70 of the spectrum are larger than those near to the thresholds @xmath71 as can be seen immediately from the profile of the transmission peaks .",
    "therefore , also the degree of resonance overlapping increases towards the middle of the spectrum .",
    "the results show that the transmission increases with increasing resonance overlapping and , correspondingly , the phase rigidity decreases .",
    "that means , the transmission increases when the resonance states align with the scattering wave function which is expressed by the decreasing of @xmath3 .",

    "from the results obtained , we conclude that @xmath88 characterizes the scenario of overlapping resonances in which the resonance states interact with one another and avoided ( and true ) crossings appear , generally . in this scenario ,",
    "the system can not be described by a hermitian hamilton operator that provides rigid phases of its eigenfunctions ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "rather , @xmath9 is non - hermitian , its eigenfunctions are biorthogonal and @xmath2 varies with energy and coupling strength . since the scattering wave function and the eigenfunctions of the effective hamiltonian",
    "are related to one another according to ( [ total1 ] ) , also @xmath3 varies between 1 and 0 in the regime of overlapping resonances .",
    "that means , the reduction of the phase rigidity @xmath3 of the scattering wave function is caused , at least partly , by the mutial interaction of neighboring resonances .",
    "it is an internal property of an open quantum system in the overlapping regime and can not be avoided .",
    "the reduction of the phase rigidity @xmath3 is , in the one - channel transmission , an expression for the ( partial ) alignment of two of the eigenfunctions @xmath90 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath9 with the two scattering wave functions @xmath91 in the overlapping regime . due to this alignment",
    "( described by @xmath92 ) , the transmission through the system is enlarged in a certain energy region around the energies @xmath93 of the two resonance states . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and the corresponding discussion in @xcite , the profile of the transmission is , when @xmath94 , completely different from that through two isolated resonance states .",

    "the relation is however unique only with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the mutial influence of neighboring resonances is , according to the results presented in  @xcite , maximum when two eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian coincide .",
    "the line profile of two completely overlapping resonance states is , in the one - channel case and up to the background term , given by @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . according to this equation ,",
    "the line profile of the two resonances differs strongly from that of isolated resonances @xcite ( determined by the rigid value @xmath89 ) . in correspondence to this result , we have @xmath98 in the one - channel case when two resonance states completely overlap .",
    "however @xmath62 might be large in this case as for weakly overlapping resonance states , as discussed above .",
    "this result underlines once more the difference between the value @xmath2 characteristic of a special resonance state @xmath36 of the system , and @xmath3 characteristic of the behavior of a sum of resonance states in the overlapping regime .",
    "thus , the avoided crossings of resonance states represent one of the sources for the dephasing @xcite observed in experimental data .",
    "the variation of @xmath99 and @xmath100 between 0 and 1 is characteristic of an open quantum system with overlapping resonance states , as stated above .",
    "therefore , dephasing and dissipation should be equivalent in terms of their effect onto the fano profile .",
    "such a result is observed experimentally , indeed @xcite .    as to averaged values",
    ", we mention the following results obtained earlier . the distributions of @xmath62 with energy and ensemble averaging calculated for large chaotic cavities , do not depend on the concrete shape of the cavity @xcite since the averaging smears the different contributions to @xmath62 . as a result",
    ", the distribution of @xmath62 is characterized , in such a case , only by the number of channels @xcite .",
    "we underline that the interaction of neighboring resonance states via the common continuum which is considered here as source for the dephasing @xcite , is fundamentally different from , e.g. , the electron - electron interaction or the interaction due to some radiation .",
    "it is rather of nonlinear geometrical origin , related to branch points in the complex energy plane , as can be seen in the following manner . on the one hand ,",
    "the branch points determine the physical properties of an open quantum system in the overlapping regime as discussed in @xcite .",
    "they are , generally , related to the avoided crossings of resonance states which demonstrate the mutual influence of resonance states . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in the present paper , the mutual interaction of neighboring resonance states is accompanied by phase changes of the eigenfunctions @xmath0 of @xmath9 as well as of the scattering wave functions @xmath4 inside the cavity . in any case",
