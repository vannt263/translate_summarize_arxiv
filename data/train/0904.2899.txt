    "<S> a new classical solution for the su(2 ) yang - mills theory , in which the euclidean energy plays a role of a parameter is found . </S>",
    "<S> a correspondence between this solution and the known selfdual multi - instanton configuration , which has the topological charge @xmath0 , is discussed , the number of parameters governing the new solution is found to be @xmath1 . for negative energies the new solution is periodic in euclidean time , for positive energies it exhibits the effect of localization , which states that the solution is completely described within a finite interval of time , for zero energy the found solution is reduced to a selfdual one .    a number of vital properties of the quantum yang - mills field can be studied using the semiclassical approach , which is based on classical solutions </S>",
    "<S> . an important class of these solutions presents the bpst instanton of ref.@xcite and its generalizations . </S>",
    "<S> for a review and summary of the properties of the instanton see e.g. ref.@xcite , its numerous applications in qcd are outlined in the book @xcite . a particular way for generalizing the instanton to arbitrary topological charges </S>",
    "<S> was discussed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as well as in the t hooft unpublished work , see the references in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this generalization is often referred to as the cftw construction . </S>",
    "<S> the general formulation of the multi - instanton solution was given by the adhm construction of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another direction for modification of the instanton solution originated in the caloron of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , whose periodic nature made it interesting for applications at finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> recent developments and a list of references for the caloron can be found in reviews @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting alternative approach to the periodic conditions , called periodic instantons , was suggested in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it proved useful for applications related to multiparticle production and studies of the barion and lepton number violation in high energy collisions and early universe @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it was noted in recent ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that there is an appealing way for generalization of the instanton - type solution , in which the euclidean energy is considered as a given , fixed parameter . </S>",
    "<S> one can foresee that this approach can be useful when the gauge field is exposed to finite temperatures , as discussed in some detail in @xcite , or when reactions with the given energy are considered . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that a solution with the given euclidean energy can be constructed using a particular way of ` deformation ' of the conventional bpst instanton .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this work is to construct and study properties of a general classical solution for the yang - mills theory , in which the action reaches its minimum provided the euclidean energy is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the energy plays a role of the parameter in this solution , which makes it natural to refer to this field configuration as the energon . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the energon can be obtained by a ` deformation ' of an arbitrary selfdual solution , which has an arbitrary topological number . </S>",
    "<S> several properties of the energon resemble properties of the selfdual solution . in particular , the electric and magnetic fields of the energon are collinear , which is in line with the main property of the selfdual solutions , though a ratio of the the fields for the energon is a function of the euclidean time . when energy in the energon is chosen zero , the energon collapses to the selfdual solution . for arbitrary energies </S>",
    "<S> the energon is not selfdual , though it reveals interesting and useful properties , which strongly depend on its energy , as specified below .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our discussion to the su(2 ) gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> the classical action of the gauge field in the euclidean formulation of this theory reads @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electric and magnetic fields , the superscript @xmath5 marks isotopic indexes , the dot - product refers to the scalar product of 3d vectors in the coordinate space . </S>",
    "<S> the bold - face notation for the 3d vectors has a conventional meaning @xmath6 here @xmath7 are the fields , their subscripts are the indexes of the euclidean 4d space @xmath8 , their spatial components are marked by @xmath9 , and @xmath10 refers to the temporal component of the euclidean space . the sign plus in front of the term @xmath11 in eq.([act ] ) </S>",
    "<S> complies with the euclidean approach . for coordinates in the euclidean space the usual notation @xmath12 is used .    </S>",
    "<S> we will need an expression for the euclidean energy of the field @xmath13 here the term @xmath14 plays the role of the density of the kinetic energy of the gauge field , which allows one to interpret @xmath15 as an effective kinetic energy of the field , while the term @xmath11 gives the density of the effective potential energy , allowing one to consider @xmath16 as the corresponding potential energy of the field . </S>",
    "<S> note again the euclidean formulation , which justifies the sign @xmath17 and makes the second term in ( [ ene ] ) negative .    </S>",
    "<S> let us find a local minimum of the action ( [ act ] ) assuming that the energy ( [ ene ] ) is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> firstly note that the conventional cauchy s inequality allows one to write @xmath18 this implies that @xmath19 where , remember , @xmath20 is defined in ( [ ene ] ) and is presumed a constant . from the latter inequality one </S>",
    "<S> derives the following restriction on the action @xmath21^{1/2}\\!\\!. \\label{estac}\\ ] ] clearly , the identity here can be reached if , and only if , the equality in eq.([cauchy ] ) is established . </S>",
    "<S> the latter takes place provided the electric and magnetic fields are collinear , which means that the equality in ( [ estac ] ) needs that @xmath22 all integrations in eq.([cauchy ] ) run over spatial coordinates @xmath23 only . as a result the coefficient @xmath24 in eq.([ekb ] ) is allowed to be an arbitrary real - valued function of @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> so far our search for the minimum of the action has resulted in eq.([ekb ] ) , which should be considered as an equation on the potentials . obviously , it is a non - linear differential equation , in which the potentials appear in linear and second order terms . </S>",
    "<S> still this is a simplification compared to the conventional form of the classical equations , which reads @xmath26 and includes nonlinear terms of the third order .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , eq.([ekb ] ) admits explicit solution . to describe it we start from a simplified form of ( [ ekb ] ) by taking the coefficient there as unity , @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> . in this particular case eqs.([ef]),([bf </S>",
    "<S> ] ) show that ( [ ekb ] ) can be written in the known form @xmath28 where @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this form represents the condition of selfduality . </S>",
    "<S> ( similarly , by taking @xmath30 one would end up with the anti - selfdual condition . ) </S>",
    "<S> a general solution of the self - dual condition is given by the known multi - instanton adhm configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to acknowledge this fact we state that if @xmath27 , then the solution of eq.([ff ] ) is @xmath31 , where the subscript ` sd ' is used throughout to indicate a selfdual solution with an arbitrary topological charge .    </S>",
    "<S> let us generalize this result for the case @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> introduce new coordinates @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is some real - valued function , which precise properties reveal themselves below . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spatial coordinates of @xmath36 are identical to spatial coordinates of @xmath37 , while their temporal coordinates are different . </S>",
    "<S> define also the potentials @xmath38 as follows @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the potentials of a selfdual solution . </S>",
    "<S> one immediately observes that the fields , which correspond to the potential @xmath38 satisfy @xmath42 they show resemblance with the fields of the instanton , but are different in that the moment of the euclidean time for these new fields equals @xmath25 , while the temporal coordinate of the selfdual fields is @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a scaling factor @xmath44 appears in the relation for the electric fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the electric and magnetic fields of the instanton solution are equal , @xmath45 , compare eq.([ff ] ) . hence eqs.([bb]),([ee ] ) imply @xmath46 observe now that this equality coincides with eq.([ekb ] ) provided the coefficients in these two equations are identified . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the potential in eqs.([am]),([a4 ] ) is a solution of eq.([ekb ] ) provided @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> the found solution incorporates the function @xmath43 , which up to this point has been treated as arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> let us specify this function . </S>",
    "<S> substitute eqs.([bb]),([ee ] ) into ( [ ene ] ) , presenting the later one as follows @xmath48 here @xmath49 is , up to the sign , the potential energy of the selfdual solution , compare definitions in eqs.([ene]),([v ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the argument @xmath50 in the integrand in ( [ kee ] ) , which was defined in ( [ z ] ) , includes @xmath51 , which makes the integral in eq.([kee ] ) a well defined function of @xmath51 for a given self - dual solution . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can treat @xmath52 as a known function @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , eq.([eqk ] ) represents a differential equation on @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> after integration it reads @xmath53 where @xmath54 should be treated as a function of @xmath51 @xmath55 correspondingly , the right - hand side in eq.([dt ] ) is a function of @xmath51 as well . </S>",
    "<S> inversing it one finds the desired function @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that for a given selfdual solution the function @xmath43 is well defined .    summing up this discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we see that in order to satisfy eq.([ekb ] ) one takes any selfdual solution and deforms it according to eqs.([am]),([a4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath43 , which is used in the process of this deformation is specified by the same selfdual solution , as eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dt]),([dotqq ] ) show . </S>",
    "<S> the result describes a local minimum of the classical action , in which the euclidean energy plays the role of a parameter . </S>",
    "<S> as was mentioned , it is convenient to call this field configuration the energon . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by this construction the energon is related to some instanton solution . </S>",
    "<S> to acknowledge this fact we will call the selfdual solution in question the ` underlying ' one , while the energon would be referred to a ` descender ' of this underlying selfdual solution .    a general selfdual solution with the topological charge @xmath0 for the su(2 ) gauge group is described by the adhm construction and is governed by @xmath57 parameters , which can be interpreted as orientations , sizes , and locations of the related instantons . </S>",
    "<S> we derive from this that the total number of parameters that govern the energon descending from such selfdual solution equals @xmath1 , where one additional parameter is the energy .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to write the action @xmath58 for the energon explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> since energy of the energon is conserved it is natural to presume that the integration over @xmath25 in eq.([act ] ) is taken within finite limits , and introduce the abbreviated action @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( the signs agree with the euclidean formulation . ) using eqs.([eb]),([eqk ] ) one derives from eq.([act ] ) that the abbreviated action for the energon reads @xmath61 the last identity here refers to a conventional presentation of the abbreviated action vie the canonical momentum @xmath62 , which is conjugated to the variable @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> one derives from this that the momentum is equal to @xmath63 here @xmath54 is a function of @xmath51 specified in eq.([dotqq ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consider how properties of the energon depend on its energy . </S>",
    "<S> observe that according to eq.([dotqq ] ) the allowed values of energy are restricted from below @xmath64 consider firstly the region of negative euclidean energies @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> for a selfdual solution with finite topological charge the magnetic field is localized mainly within the finite volume of the euclidean 4d space . hence , eq.([kee ] ) implies that @xmath66 when @xmath67 and , consequently , eq.([dotqq ] ) shows that @xmath51 is bound by condition @xmath68    which specifies one or several finite intervals of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[ras ] illustrates this statement . </S>",
    "<S> it shows a situation , when the underlying selfdual configuration is described by the cftw multi - instanton construction . in this particular example </S>",
    "<S> the two - instanton solution is taken in which two instantons have same size @xmath69 and are separated by the distance @xmath70 along the temporal coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows the potential energy @xmath71 , which is calculated from eq.([kee ] ) and is depicted versus the coordinate @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dva ] discussed below presents @xmath72 versus @xmath25 . ) the potential energy exhibits two minima , one for each of the instantons . the value of the potential energy at the minima is close to the minimum of the potential energy of a single instanton of the same size @xmath69 . the later minimum , which equals @xmath73 , is chosen as a scaling factor for the energies presented in the figure , while the coordinate @xmath51 is scaled by the size @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> one observes that there is a region of euclidean energies , where the inequality in eq.([v < ] ) is satisfied within only one interval of @xmath51 , see the energy level shown by a thin horizontal line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ras ] . for sufficiently low energies </S>",
    "<S> there are two intervals of @xmath51 where eq.([v < ] ) is satisfied , each located within the limits set by a shape of the corresponding minimum of @xmath71 , as the dashed and dot - dashed lines show .    from eq.([dotqq ] ) one derives that for each interval of @xmath51 , which satisfies eq.([v < ] ) for a given euclidean energy , there exists a solution of ( [ dotqq ] ) described by a periodic function @xmath43 , which oscillates within the limits provided by the given interval . </S>",
    "<S> each such function describes the particular energon . therefore if for some energy several functions @xmath43 are present , there are several corresponding energons .    for a particular value of @xmath25 , when @xmath51 reaches the boundary of the interval , the function @xmath43 satisfies @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eb ] ) shows that at this point the electric field is absent . </S>",
    "<S> everywhere else @xmath75 and the electric field is not zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , eq.([dotqq ] ) ensures a restriction from above , @xmath76 , which according to eq.([eb ] ) shows that each component of the electric field is necessarily smaller than the corresponding magnetic one @xmath77 when the euclidean energy is close to the local minimum of the function @xmath71 , the electric field of the energon is small . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , when the energy converges to the minimum , the electric field disappears . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the kinetic energy of the energon at this point is zero , while its potential energy equals the minimum of the potential energy of the underlying instanton solution . </S>",
    "<S> the example presented in fig.[ras ] shows two degenerate minima of the potential energy ( the degeneracy is due to the fact that the instantons are chosen of identical size ) , so that when @xmath78 reaches the minimum of the potential energy the energon can be located at any of the two available minima , having there zero kinetic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> previously a situation of this type has been encountered in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in relation to the sphaleron problem . </S>",
    "<S> remember that the sphaleron was firstly considered in ref.@xcite as a self - consistent solution for interacting gauge and higgs fields . </S>",
    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite argued that the pure gauge field exhibits the sphaleron - type behavior when it is treated using particular restrictions . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of this work found a particular configuration of the gauge field , which possesses only the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the energon allows one to relate this construction , call it the cos - sphaleron , to the single - instanton problem , as discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration above generalizes this statement by showing that the energon , which descends from an arbitrary multi - instanton solution possesses only the magnetic field , provided the euclidean energy is chosen at a local minimum of the potential energy of the underlying selfdual configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> consider small euclidean energies . </S>",
    "<S> take first the case of zero energy , @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> then eq.([dotqq ] ) shows that @xmath80 , which indicates that there are two options . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath81 we have @xmath82 and eqs.([ee]),([bb ] ) show that the energon is identical to the underlying selfdual solution . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , when @xmath83 the energon is identical to the anti - selfdual solution , which differs from the initial , underlying selfdual one by the sign of the temporal component of the potential . from this discussion </S>",
    "<S> one derives that for small negative euclidean energy the function @xmath43 exhibits oscillations as a function of the euclidean time @xmath25 . the smaller the absolute value of the energy , the larger the period of these oscillations , and the larger the interval of @xmath51 , which is covered during these oscillations . for half of the period of these oscillations </S>",
    "<S> the energon looks mostly similar to the underlying selfdual solution except the two areas near the stopping points @xmath74 . at these points </S>",
    "<S> the electric field of the energon is zero , while the electric field of the selfdual solution is not . </S>",
    "<S> however , the smaller the absolute value of the energy , the less important the vicinities of these points are since they are located at large @xmath51 and @xmath25 where all the fields are small anyway . </S>",
    "<S> similarly for the next half - period the energon looks akin the anti - selfdual solution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , during one period of oscillations the energon changes its appearance being close in turn to the selfdual and anti - selfdual solution .    </S>",
    "<S> previously this type of behavior was found for the periodic solution constructed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which was called ` periodic instantons ' . </S>",
    "<S> it is described by the periodic in @xmath25 function , which describes a chain of the instantons and antiinstantons , see also @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we observe a more general manifestation of a similar phenomenon , which takes place for an underlying selfdual solution with an arbitrary topological charge . for negative and low euclidean energies </S>",
    "<S> the energon can be approximated by a chain of the underlying selfdual and related anti - selfdual solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now the region of positive euclidean energies @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> eqs.([dt]),([dotqq ] ) in this case show that the function @xmath43 is monotonic . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it is easy to see that it varies from @xmath85 when @xmath25 runs over some finite interval , say @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is defined using eq.([dt ] ) as follows @xmath88 the integral here converges well since at large @xmath51 the function @xmath52 decreases rapidly . to illustrate the latter statement take the simplest case when the underlying selfdual solution is the single instanton . </S>",
    "<S> then , taking the conventional gauge one has @xmath89 where @xmath69 is the instanton size , and from eq.([kee ] ) one finds @xmath90 substituting this function in eq.([t0 ] ) one derives @xmath91 here the parameter @xmath92 is introduced . for positive energies </S>",
    "<S> it is obviously positive @xmath93 , therefore the integral is convergent and gives a sensible definition for @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> similar result holds for the energon descending from any selfdual solution .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that the discussed definition of the energon at the positive energy is valid only within a finite interval of @xmath25 , @xmath94 . inside this interval </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath43 is finite , and its derivative is large , @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eb ] ) indicates therefore that for positive energies each component of the magnetic field is smaller than the corresponding component of the electric one , @xmath96 when @xmath25 is close to the boundaries , @xmath97 , the function @xmath43 diverges , @xmath98 . as a result both electric and magnetic fields are decreasing here , @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([finst ] ) , in which @xmath100 for @xmath101 , illustrates this decrease when the energon descends from a single instanton . </S>",
    "<S> thus the energon as a function of @xmath25 is well localized within the interval @xmath94 .    as a slightly more sophisticated illustration </S>",
    "<S> consider fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dva ] , which shows the potential energy of the energon with positive euclidean energy . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying selfdual solution is taken the same as the one discussed previously in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ras ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is a cftw solution , in which two instantons of the same size @xmath69 are separated by the distance @xmath70 along the temporal coordinate . the solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dva ] describes the potential energy for this selfdual solution . </S>",
    "<S> it has conventional tails at large @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> note the difference in the temporal coordinates , which equals @xmath51 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ras ] and @xmath25 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dva ] . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve in these two figures has a similar shape , but different meaning . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ras ] it describes the potential energy of the energon , while in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dva ] it represents the potential energy of the underlying selfdual solution . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line in fig.[dva ] presents the potential energy for the energon , which descends from the chosen selfdual solution . </S>",
    "<S> the euclidean energy was taken @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> for this energy and the given selfdual configuration eq.([t0 ] ) gives @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dva ] illustrates the fact that the energon is restricted within the area @xmath86 , which is marked by the arrows . on the boundaries of this region </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy is zero , which signals that both the magnetic and electric fields are also zero here in accord with the general properties of the energon for the positive energy .    </S>",
    "<S> one can extend the definition for the energon outside the finite interval @xmath86 , but such an extension is not uniquely defined . </S>",
    "<S> one can cover the entire axis @xmath105 by an infinite set of finite intervals of time in such a way that in each interval there exists a particular energon . </S>",
    "<S> however , these energons can be defined differently for different intervals . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , they can be distinguished by the underlying selfdual solution , which can be differently taken for different intervals . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , even if the underlying selfdual solution is chosen the same for all intervals of time , there still remains a freedom to choose the sign in eq.([dotqq ] ) , which may be different in different intervals of time . </S>",
    "<S> each energon defined through this procedure is well localized within its own interval of @xmath25 , and does not interfere with other energons defined within their own intervals of time . </S>",
    "<S> thus , on the axis @xmath106 there may coexist a variety of different energons . </S>",
    "<S> generically these solutions are not periodic in @xmath25 , though some of them exhibit the periodicity .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , this work formulates the classical solution for the yang - mills theory in the form of the energon , i.e. solution which minimizes the action provided the euclidean energy is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit form of the energon is derived from an arbitrary selfdual , multi - instanton solution , which is deformed using eqs.([am]),([a4 ] ) . the number of parameters , which govern the energon for the su(2 ) gauge group equals @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the topological charge of the multi - instanton solution . </S>",
    "<S> the electric and magnetic fields of the energon are collinear , but in difference with the known property of the selfdual solution they are not equal , see eq.([eb ] ) that includes a function of the euclidean time , which is defined by the initial selfdual solution via eq.([dotqq ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the energon strongly depend on the euclidean energy . at zero energy </S>",
    "<S> there are two options ; the energon either equals the underlying selfdual configuration , or coincides with the related anti - selfdual one . for small negative energies there </S>",
    "<S> exists one energon , which is related to one periodic function @xmath43 available here . during half of its period </S>",
    "<S> this solution is close to the underlying selfdual configuration , for the other half period to anti - selfdual one . with decrease of energy </S>",
    "<S> several energons may appear , each related to a particular periodic function , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ras ] . for positive energies </S>",
    "<S> the energon is localized within a finite interval of the euclidean time . </S>",
    "<S> it can be extended outside this interval , but such an extension is governed by an infinite number of parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> a balance between the electric and magnetic fields also depends on energy . for negative energies </S>",
    "<S> each component of the electric field is smaller than the corresponding component of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when the energy reaches a minimum of the potential energy @xmath107 , the electric field disappears , and the energon possesses only the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> one can call therefore the region of negative energies the ` magnetic zone ' .    for positive energies </S>",
    "<S> the situation is opposite , the electric field here is always stronger than the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the energy , the more strongly the electric field prevails over the magnetic one . </S>",
    "<S> one can call the region of positive energies the ` electric zone ' . fittingly , the electric ( @xmath84 ) and magnetic ( @xmath108 ) zones are separated by the region of zero energy ( @xmath109 ) , where the energon equals the ( anti ) selfdual solution whose electric and magnetic fields are equal .    </S>",
    "<S> it was mentioned that the selfdual configuration that underlies the energon can be described using the adhm construction , which has a finite topological charge . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , there exist selfdual solutions , which are not described by this construction , for example the caloron . </S>",
    "<S> the topological charge of the caloron depends on one s perspective . </S>",
    "<S> if , following @xcite one restricts the integration over @xmath25 by the caloron period , then the caloron has the topological charge one . </S>",
    "<S> however , if this integration is taken over the whole axis of @xmath25 , then the caloron topological charge is infinite , which explains why it can not be described by the adhm construction . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that the solution found in the present work permits one to consider an arbitrary underlying selfdual configuration , including the caloron or other possible solution with the infinite topological charge .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an appealing way for generalization of the energon . </S>",
    "<S> recall that it is formulated as a classical solution in which the euclidean energy is fixed , and that the energy is given by an integral over the 3d space of coordinates @xmath23 performed over the particular , quadratic in the gauge fields form . </S>",
    "<S> take now an arbitrary 3d surface @xmath58 in the 4d euclidean space , which includes the origin . </S>",
    "<S> consider also an arbitrary quadratic in @xmath3 and @xmath4 form @xmath110 with constant coefficients . </S>",

    "<S> one can think , for example , that @xmath112 is a component of the momentum , or angular momentum of the field , or it can be some quantity that bears a color index . </S>",
