    "understanding the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the most pressing problems .",
    "it is theoretically expected that the phase diagram has rich structures as a function of the temperature @xmath9 , the baryon or quark chemical potential @xmath10 , the isospin chemical potential @xmath3 , the external electromagnetic fields , and so on .",
    "hot and/or dense qcd phases such as a quark - gluon plasma , color superconductivity , and the hadronic phase where we live are supposed to be realized in the early universe , inside of compact stellar objects , and in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the theoretical understanding of a limited portion of the phase diagram in the high-@xmath9 and low-@xmath2 region has been obtained by means of several techniques including lattice - qcd simulations , effective model studies , and re - summed perturbation theories .",
    "in contrast , for the dense system at small @xmath9 , the understanding is far from satisfactory except for normal nuclear matter where the traditional nuclear theory can be applied , and for such high density that perturbative qcd works once all gluons get screened by the meissner effect in color superconductivity  @xcite . unlike the case with @xmath11 , lattice - qcd simulations based on the monte - carlo algorithm has a serious difficulty called the sign problem due to a fluctuating phase of the fermion ( dirac ) determinant at @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to evade the sign problem ; the taylor expansion  @xcite , the re - weighing method  @xcite , the imaginary chemical potential  @xcite , and the complex langevin equation  @xcite , but they are not yet well - developed to go beyond the small-@xmath13 regime .    in the @xmath14 limit ,",
    "as long as @xmath15 is smaller than the baryon mass minus the nuclear binding energy ( i.e.@xmath16 ) , we can make a firm conclusion even without tackling the sign problem .",
    "trivially , no physical excitation is allowed for @xmath17 and none of physical properties should depend on @xmath15 or @xmath2 then .",
    "it is also the case for a system with a finite isospin chemical potential @xmath3 if it is smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "even though physics is transparent on the intuitive level , the microscopic origin of @xmath2-independence or @xmath3-independence has a puzzling character and still deserves theoretical investigations , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "even with sufficiently small @xmath2 or @xmath3 , since the dirac operator and thus its eigenvalues have explicit dependence on chemical potentials , one would naively expect that the partition function depends on such @xmath2 or @xmath3 , but physically it should not .",
    "interestingly , thus , that nothing happens trivially is a hint of non - trivial physics inherent in the sign problem .",
    "this problem is often called the `` silver blaze '' named after a famous detective story of sherlock holmes  @xcite .    in the case of @xmath3",
    ", it has been convincingly shown already in ref .",
    "@xcite that the dirac determinant can be @xmath3-independent due to a gap in the energy spectrum and this gap is given precisely by @xmath18 .",
    "the same argument can hold for the @xmath2-independence as long as @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the silver blaze problem remains profound for the specific window , @xmath20 .",
    "it is argued that the phase fluctuation should be responsible for the @xmath2-independence in this region .",
    "in fact , there is a demonstration that the average over the phase fluctuations of the dirac determinant may cancel the @xmath2-dependence  @xcite .",
    "such a physical mechanism with fluctuating phase ought to be related to quark confinement  @xcite ; indeed , quark excitation is averaged out by the @xmath21-symmetric phase distribution in the confined phase that is to be identified as the disordered state  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to address the silver blaze behavior within the framework of veneziano s @xmath5 expansion and also t  hooft s @xmath4 expansion .",
    "to this end we exploit the worldline formalism ( or the canonical ensemble representation ) in order to expand the dirac determinant in powers of @xmath5  @xcite ( see also arguments in ref .",
    "the leading order @xmath22-contribution to the free energy is purely gluonic .",
    "we will focus on the sub - leading @xmath23- and the sub - sub - leading @xmath24-contributions . at @xmath23 order two theories , one with @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the other with @xmath12 and @xmath27 are equivalent to each other in the @xmath28-even sector  @xcite , as long as @xmath3 and @xmath2 are small enough not to induce any finite baryon or isospin density . when the next @xmath24-contribution is added , the equivalence between @xmath3 and @xmath2 no longer holds  @xcite .",
    "the virtue of this @xmath5 expansion lies in the clear separation of the baryon and pion sectors that belong to the @xmath23- and the @xmath24-contributions , respectively .",
    "although our formulation provides us with a useful organization of different physics origins , veneziano s expansion at finite density is a subtle expansion and we should be cautious about the results .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5 expansion amounts to a series of @xmath5 corrections around the state at @xmath29 that is nothing but the quenched limit .",
    "it is known that the quenched simulation at finite density sometimes leads to unphysical results , especially the density onset seems to be set not by @xmath6 but @xmath7 , which would cause additional subtlety in the argument on the silver blaze puzzle in veneziano s expansion .",
    "we argue that in the t  hooft limit of @xmath30 the formulation could be put in a rather clean environment and our argument is validated . with finite @xmath0 or in the orientifold large-@xmath0 limit as we discuss later , it seems that the silver blaze puzzle still remains quite non - trivial .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we review the decomposition of the qcd partition function in the @xmath5 expansion with a chemical potential . in sec .  [",
    "sec : ncnf ] , with @xmath31 fixed , we analyze the expression for the free energy at @xmath23 and discuss the dependence of the free energy on @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : nf2 ] , we turn to the next - order free energy at @xmath24 . we briefly discuss a possible situation in the orientifold large-@xmath0 limit in sec .",
    "[ sec : orientifold ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "let us consider qcd generalized for @xmath0 colors and degenerate @xmath1 quark flavors with identical mass @xmath32 .",
    "the partition function of this theory on @xmath33 with the anti - periodic boundary condition for quarks is expressed in a form of the functional integration with respect to the gauge fields @xmath34 .",
    "the integrand consists of the weight factors from the yang - mills action ( denoted by @xmath35 $ ] ) and the fermionic dirac determinant ( denoted by @xmath36 $ ] ) .",
    "the latter can be decomposed generally in terms of the winding number @xmath37 as @xmath38 here , the index @xmath39 runs over different quark flavors .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath34 can be found in the literature , e.g.  with use of the worldline formalism  @xcite .",
    "we note that this decomposition with respect to @xmath37 can translate into the canonical ensemble with @xmath37 identified as the quark number  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] shows an example of the @xmath41 case .",
    "we note that the configuration along @xmath42 may be wandering , and a special straight configuration is nothing but the polyakov loop .",
    "that corresponds to how many times the configuration wraps around @xmath42 .",
    "this example shows a case of @xmath43.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    an important property of @xmath44 is that the connected @xmath45-point function of @xmath44 is diagrammatically suppressed by @xmath5 as  @xcite @xmath46 this @xmath47 suppression appears from the gluon interaction @xmath48 that connects @xmath44 s .",
    "the expansion of @xmath49 in terms of @xmath44 ( after taking the flavor sum ) leads to an expansion in powers of @xmath5 , namely , the expansion in the veneziano limit . here , we take the average in the vacuum at @xmath50 , i.e.  the pure yang - mills theory whose weight factor is @xmath51 .",
    "the subscript `` c '' in the expectation value denotes the contribution from the `` connected '' diagrams .",
    "another important property of @xmath44 is that it is exponentially suppressed with @xmath37 at least as @xmath52 with the bare quark mass @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the suppression could be even faster with @xmath32 replaced with a dynamical @xmath53 when we take the expectation value , @xmath54 , which we will discuss later .",
    "this property ensures the convergence of the expansion in terms of @xmath37 up to a certain value of @xmath55 less than the quark mass .",
    "the free energy is then expressed in a form of an expectation value as @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents the pure gluonic energy of @xmath22 , the second @xmath59 with @xmath60 ( in which we omitted `` c '' that is irrelevant for the one - point function of @xmath61 ) is of @xmath23 , and the expansion goes on as the third @xmath62 with @xmath63 of @xmath24 and so on , according to eq .  .",
    "it is important to note that this is not yet a consistent ordering of the @xmath4 expansion ; our identification of @xmath59 and @xmath62 is based on the power of @xmath5 and each of @xmath59 and @xmath62 contains sub - leading ( non - planar ) contributions suppressed by higher powers of @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we shall work only at sufficiently small temperature , @xmath64 , where the yang - mills vacuum should be in the confined phase .",
    "( otherwise , it is rather trivial what is going on in the deconfined phase . )",
    "this phase is characterized by the realization of @xmath65 ( center ) symmetry , so that the expectation value of a center non - symmetric operator vanishes , namely , @xmath66 it should be mentioned that the expansion is made around the vacuum of the pure yang - mills theory , so that confinement can bear a well - defined meaning and the above expectation value can be strictly vanishing except for @xmath67 . physically speaking , one winding corresponds to a single - quark excitation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , and each time the winding number reaches @xmath0 , a color singlet is formed out of @xmath0 quarks .",
    "we shall thus call such a configuration with @xmath68 a _",
    "baryonic configuration_. we can easily extend the above to more general correlations in the confined phase as @xmath69 then , in the confined phase at low @xmath9 , non - vanishing terms out of eqs .   and",

    ", intuitively , @xmath59 above corresponds to a `` multi baryon contribution '' with @xmath73 baryons .",
    "the first term in the next contribution , @xmath62 , corresponds to a `` mesonic contribution '' and the second in the parentheses is a mixed correlation of baryons and mesons .",
    "as long as @xmath55 is small enough as compared to the baryonic scale of @xmath59 , these mixed - type contributions are always more suppressed than the pure mesonic contribution .",
    "thus , we can safely neglect the mixed - type term when we discuss the density region up to the onset as in what follows .    here",
    ", let us emphasize that this procedure to take the @xmath21-symmetric average is a vital step to understand the silver blaze problem for the baryon density onset",
    ". as we mentioned , one must take account of the phase fluctuations of the dirac determinant in this density region of @xmath74 , and we effectively do this by dropping center non - symmetric operators . indeed , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , fractional ( not a multiple of @xmath0 ) excitations of quarks that break center symmetry explicitly are closely related to the sign problem .",
    "usually , in the thermodynamic ( i.e.  infinite volume ) limit in particular , the canonical ensemble becomes quite singular and it loses the strength to solve the sign problem practically . in our present formulation ,",
    "however , we combine it with the @xmath5 expansion , so that unwanted quark excitations diminish and the whole machinery is under theoretical control .",
    "in this section , we consider @xmath59 in an @xmath75 theory with @xmath31 fixed , and denote corresponding chemical potentials by @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in this way we can introduce a quark ( baryon ) chemical potential as @xmath78 or an isospin chemical potential as @xmath79 .",
    "then , up to this order of @xmath80 , the free energy reads @xmath81 it is crucially important to note that no difference arises at this order for @xmath82 and @xmath79 . in other words ,",
    "the system at finite quark chemical potential is equivalent to the system at finite isospin chemical potential at @xmath23 because there is no correlation function involving different flavor sectors .",
    "the two flavor sectors do not talk to each other , so to speak  @xcite .    specifically in this section , we shall use a collective notation @xmath83 not distinguishing @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as we already discussed in the previous section , in the tree - level",
    ", @xmath84 implies that the free energy in the limit of @xmath14 becomes independent of @xmath83 if @xmath85 .",
    "when we perform the functional integration over the gauge fields , this exponential factor would decrease faster ; @xmath86 should be replaced with the baryonic - dressed mass @xmath87 ( where we picked up only the contribution from @xmath37 baryons but neglected any `` composite - baryon '' possibility , which should be empirically reasonable ) .",
    "this means that @xmath88 in other words we can state that this is our _ definition _ of the baryon mass .",
    "in fact , together with eq .  , we can see that the expansion takes a form of @xmath89 \\label{eq : baryon}\\ ] ] apart from prefactors that are not of our interest to locate the density onset .",
    "it is obvious that the free energy should not change with @xmath83 until @xmath83 hits the onset at @xmath90 ( which should be corrected by the binding energy @xmath91 of nuclear matter that is incorporated , in principle , in the definition   for large @xmath37 ) because no particle can excite at @xmath14 .",
    "thus , from this point of view of the density onset , our definition makes sense to characterize the baryon mass .    in the context of the silver blaze problem",
    ", a more non - trivial question is whether our @xmath6 can behave differently from the pion mass @xmath7 or not .",
    "the main concern regarding the silver blaze problem lies in the observation that the lowest excitation energy even in the baryonic sector seems to be governed by @xmath7 .",
    "we therefore need to treat our @xmath6 very carefully and should clarify if @xmath92 or not .",
    "if this happened unfortunately , the results are unphysical and any useful information on the silver blaze puzzle in the most non - trivial region is not available at all . as a matter of fact , in the realistic world with @xmath93 , it is often the case that @xmath92 is concluded .",
    "for the case with @xmath93 we can have a valuable hint from lattice - qcd simulations .",
    "along the line of the lattice - qcd setup , it would be instructive to rewrite our @xmath59 in a slightly different form using the quark number operator @xmath94 .",
    "it is easy to confirm the following expression , @xmath95 up to a @xmath83-independent constant . in the final form",
    "@xmath96 is the same quantity as the quark number expectation value measured in the quenched simulation .",
    "we note that this expectation value contains all gluonic loops , i.e. , not only planar diagrams but also higher genus diagrams , but no quark loops .",
    "surprisingly , the results from lattice simulations and also from random matrix model imply that @xmath96 becomes non - zero when @xmath83 exceeds @xmath18",
    "@xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", this @xmath7 is not necessarily the physical pion mass , but the quenched pion mass , @xmath97 .",
    "it is still possible to distinguish @xmath97 from physical baryon mass by looking at how they behave with decreasing @xmath32 ; in the @xmath98 limit @xmath7 or @xmath97 goes to zero but the physical baryon mass should not .",
    "if one finds @xmath6 approaching zero in the chiral limit , @xmath6 should be more like the pion mass rather than the physical baryon mass .",
    "such a striking observation was established first in the so - called `` phase quenched '' simulation , in which the fluctuating phase of the dirac determinant is neglected and its modulus , @xmath99|^2 $ ] , is implemented in the simulation .",
    "it is understood today that such an approximation is equivalent to replacing the chemical potential with the isospin one , @xmath3 , so that the onset is determined by not @xmath100 but @xmath101 .",
    "later on , it was recognized that the same conclusion is drawn to the quenched simulation in which the whole dirac determinant is neglected , which is much more non - trivial to understand .    .",
    "( b ) a baryonic configuration screened by @xmath102 leading to three baryonic pions , the mass of which has nothing to do with the physical baryon mass but is characterized by @xmath103.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the onset at @xmath101 in the quenched simulation is caused by the condensation of an `` unphysical bound state '' of a quark and a conjugate anti - quark called the baryonic pion  @xcite as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic2 ]  ( a ) .",
    "let us explain what is happening using the language of the so - called partially quenched chiral perturbation theory  @xcite",
    ". in the quenched limit all quark loops should be removed , and we can formulate this by introducing a ghost field @xmath102 . to cancel the dirac determinant exactly , @xmath102 should be a bosonic quark ( but should satisfy the anti - periodic boundary condition along the thermal @xmath42 ) that yields an inverse of the dirac determinant .",
    "we must utilize such a formulation with quarks and ghosts to deal correctly with the computation of non - hermitian expectation value like eq .  .",
    "because such bosonic ghosts are abundant at finite density , a quark can easily pick an anti-@xmath102 up and form a bound state @xmath104-@xmath105 or the baryonic pion , the mass of which is denoted here as @xmath106 . in this setup of the quenched limit , if we have a configuration with @xmath37 quarks , as is depicted in fig .  [ fig : schematic2 ]  ( b ) , they turn into @xmath37 baryonic pions rather than physical hadrons .",
    "thus , we trivially have @xmath107 , and for the baryonic configuration with @xmath0 quarks , @xmath6 does not access the genuine baryonic sector but simply @xmath108 , which immediately leads to the funny observation , @xmath109 . in this way we can understand the subtle nature of the quenched limit when involving non - hermitian operators .    from the above argument it is highly conceivable that taking the large-@xmath0 limit may cure the subtle situation .",
    "the essential point is that the large-@xmath0 limit already encompasses the quenched limit and no quark loops appear .",
    "this means that we do not have to introduce the ghost field @xmath102 to cancel the dirac determinant .",
    "then , because there is no @xmath102 , the theory does not have the unphysical baryonic pion .",
    "of course , one can still keep introducing @xmath102 , but its excitations are negligible as compared to the gluon excitation that is of @xmath22 . in other words , forming an unphysical bound state is regarded as the screening effect or the qcd - string breaking . in the large-@xmath0 limit the qcd string extends , so that the linear potential and thus confinement can persist strictly . because there is no @xmath102-induced screening in the large-@xmath0 limit , the baryonic configuration couples to the physical baryon excitation .    to strengthen our argument ,",
    "let us attempt to confirm explicitly that @xmath100 is certainly heavier than @xmath110 within the framework based on the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "as we already mentioned , @xmath59 contains all the sub - leading terms in the large-@xmath0 counting , while it is a leading - order contribution in the veneziano expansion . here , because we are interested in the behavior of @xmath6 only , it is sufficient for us to focus on the analysis of @xmath111",
    ". then , let us pay our close attention to the large-@xmath0 expansion of this quantity that consists of @xmath0 quarks propagating in the same direction .     order as the bare - quark propagation , the sum of which should lead to the dynamical mass @xmath53 .",
    "( b ) one gluon exchange between two quarks , which is suppressed by @xmath112 .",
    "( there appears no @xmath0 factor by closing a quark loop.),scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in each quark propagation the self - energy insertion from the interaction with gluons may appear and this is not suppressed by @xmath4 as is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : selfenergy ]  ( a ) .",
    "we can also think of higher - order planar diagrams of the self - energy ( typically represented by a rainbow - type re - summation ) , which eventually leads to the dynamical quark mass @xmath53 ( as is the case in the dyson - schwinger studies  @xcite ) .",
    "this is how the constituent picture of quarks with dynamical mass emerges . for the baryonic configuration",
    ", we can also think of different types of diagrams that connect separate quark lines with gluons but the interaction among quarks is always suppressed by @xmath4 as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfenergy ]  ( b ) .",
    "each time one gluon exchange occurs between two quarks ( i.e.  diquark interaction ) , it gives a suppression factor by @xmath112 , which is eventually compensated for by a combinatorial enhancement .",
    "thus , we can parametrically write the leading-@xmath0 baryon mass as @xmath113 where @xmath114 represents the energy gain from the one - gluon exchange interaction in the diquark channel ( scaled by @xmath0 so that @xmath115 ) . it should be also mentioned that we neglected the kinetic energy in the above expression , which is suppressed in the large-@xmath0 case .",
    "the combinatorial factor , @xmath116 originates from the number of independent diagrams in which two of @xmath0 quarks are selected out . before proceeding further , we shall look at the pion sector next .",
    "let us next consider the `` mesonic contribution '' of @xmath24 that makes a discrimination between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we first consider the isospin chemical potential , @xmath79 .",
    "let us remember that , on the one hand , at @xmath23 the free energies with either an isospin or a quark chemical potential are equivalent to each other , but @xmath62 at @xmath24 , on the other hand , makes a sharp contrast and distinguishes one from the other .",
    "the free energy then reads , @xmath117 in the same way as the analysis in the previous section we can define our pion mass from the following expectation value ( under the approximation that we neglect `` composite - pion '' configurations , which is justified in the large-@xmath0 limit where the meson interaction is turned off ) ; @xmath118 then , using this definition of @xmath119 , apart from unimportant prefactors , we see that the last term of eq .   has the following form of the expansion ; @xmath120 \\;.\\ ] ] thus , as long as @xmath121 , the expansion is converging and the free energy in the @xmath14 limit is completely insensitive to @xmath3 , leading to zero isospin density . in other words",
    "the threshold of the pion condensation is given by @xmath122 , and so it is quite reasonable to adopt the above definition   of the pion mass .",
    "for the case of the quark chemical potential , @xmath82 , unlike the isospin chemical potential case , we can see that the leading contribution of @xmath62 is independent of @xmath2 as @xmath123 therefore , the onset of the quark number density is solely determined by @xmath59 and so our baryon mass @xmath6 gives the threshold .",
    "it is an interesting and non - trivial observation that the physics of @xmath2 and that of @xmath3 belong to different sectors in the power counting of @xmath5 .",
    "now let us proceed to a more quantitative aspect of the silver blaze problem ; the critical question is how large @xmath122 is precisely ? as we argued in the previous section , the quenched simulation with finite @xmath0 implicitly requires the bosonic ghost fields , while quark loops just decouple in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the meson diagrams at large @xmath0 are well - known and the ladder re - summation as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion ] gives the meson .",
    "we can then parameterize the meson mass as follows ; @xmath124 it is known  @xcite that the projection of the one - gluon exchange interaction to the scalar and the diquark channels , respectively , leads to the factor ; @xmath125 which means that @xmath126v_{\\text{scalar}}$ ] . for the lightest pseudo - scalar ( i.e.  pion ) channel @xmath127 should be about @xmath128 at most in order to realize small @xmath119 of the nambu - goldstone boson . using the above coefficients we can make an estimate of the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath119 as @xmath129 in particular , when the maximally large @xmath130 is realized to render the pion mass to vanish , the lower bound of the baryon mass could be @xmath131_{\\text{lowest } } \\simeq { n_{\\text{c}}}{m_{\\text{q}}}/2 $ ] ,",
    "that is , the baryon mass can not be lighter than a half of the sum of the constituent quark mass .",
    "although the quantitative estimate here might be a bit oversimplified , the essential point in this present argument is that it is very likely that @xmath6 is heavier than @xmath132 .",
    "this hand - waving argument suggests that the diquark interaction is not strong enough to make the baryon as light as the pion in the large-@xmath0 world , which makes a sharp contrast to the finite-@xmath0 quenched world where @xmath133 in the chiral limit .",

    "the meson , as in ordinary qcd consists of a pair of fermion and anti - fermion . as for the baryons ,",
    "the issue is more subtle : the most natural candidate consists of @xmath0 fermions , contracted by two epsilon tensors .",
    "it turns out , however , that this identification is not correct .",

    "@xcite ) that this simple `` baryon '' is not stable and , moreover , does not admit the properties of baryons , as anticipated from the skyrme model .",
    "the correct object that should be identified as the baryon consists of @xmath138 fermions .",

    "this expansion converges only for small values of the chemical potential , the breakdown of which indicates the onset of finite density .    in particular , at @xmath149 of the free energy , the isospin and the quark chemical potentials are equivalent to each other .",
    "the density onset is associated with a baryonic configuration of @xmath0 windings , which leads to a baryonic mass scale @xmath6 .",
    "a crucial ingredient in our analysis is the role of the center symmetry , i.e.@xmath21 .",
    "we used the fact that in the confining vacuum center symmetry is unbroken . therefore , while the dirac determinant may depend on the chemical potential , at @xmath14 , the only non - zero contributions come from the zero ( modulo @xmath0 ) winding sector and the rest vanishes due to @xmath21 phase fluctuations .    at @xmath24 of the free energy , on the other hand , the isospin and the quark chemical potentials are no longer equivalent .",
    "while no new dependence on the quark chemical potential appears at this order , for the isospin chemical potential we encounter a mesonic configuration of a quark and an anti - quark . in that case",
    "the physical picture is as follows : the isospin density onset is characterized by such mesonic configurations , the mass from which is @xmath119 .",
    "an important part of our analysis consists of the estimate of @xmath100 vs.  @xmath122 . with veneziano",
    "s expansion we need to evaluate the operator expectation values with the pure yang - mills vacuum , and when the finite - density operator is non - hermitian , the inevitable inclusion of conjugate quarks or ghosts makes the behavior of @xmath6 unphysical .",
    "we argue that we can extract the physical information on @xmath6 thanks to t  hooft s large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "based on diagrammatic analysis , also , we provided an intuitive account for @xmath150 at large @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is definitely a window between the onset of the pion condensation and the finite baryon density in this particular limit .",
    "apart from the silver blaze puzzle , our expansion scheme is quite unique on its own .",
    "we can see an appreciable difference from the standard large-@xmath0 limit if we consider the free energy at finite temperature @xmath9 : there is an exponentially small but non - zero contribution to the free energy of a form , @xmath151 $ ] in the baryon case and @xmath152 $ ] in the isospin case .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath9 is not strictly zero , the free energy is _ not _ completely @xmath9-independent , as one might have naively expected from the large-@xmath0 eguchi - kawai reduction  @xcite .",
    "this is because we first expanded the dirac operator to identify the terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and these sub - leading and sub - sub - leading terms contain the baryonic and the mesonic excitations , respectively , as `` valence '' degrees of freedom , though virtual excitations are prohibited in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "it would be worth revisiting veneziano s limit to count the physical degrees of freedom not only in the baryon sector  @xcite but in the meson sector also .",
    "future applications of our formulation would include concrete implementation in the lattice - qcd simulation ; the investigation of the silver blaze behavior in the canonical ensemble can clearly separate two sectors sensitive to the isospin density and to the quark density . then , one can test whether the onset is really given by the physical pion mass and the physical baryon mass .",
    "once this is confirmed , even without veneziano s expansion and without potential complication from ghosts , one may be able to justify our understanding of the silver blaze behavior even for the case with finite @xmath0 .",
    "on the analytical level which would supplement the numerical efforts , perhaps , the hopping - parameter expansion ( which shares a similarity with the large-@xmath0 expansion ) , together with the re - summation of higher - winding configurations  @xcite , will yield a useful exemplification to diagnose the silver blaze puzzle , hopefully in a consistent way with the scenario presented in this work .",
