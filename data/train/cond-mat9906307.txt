    "recently , single - particle properties of electrons in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) electron systems have attracted considerable interest . with the theoretical calculations of quasiparticle renormalization factor@xcite and the momentum distribution function around the fermi surface , hu and",
    "das sarma@xcite have clarified that a clean 1d electron system shows the luttinger liquid behavior , but even a slightest amount of impurities restores the fermi surface and the fermi - liquid behavior remains . within a one - subband model , they evaluated the self - energy due to electron - electron coulomb interaction in unclean q1d systems by using the leading - order gw dynamical screening approximation.@xcite within such an approximation , hwang and das sarma@xcite obtained the band - gap renormalization in photoexcited doped - semiconductor quantum wire in the presence of plasmon - phonon coupling .",
    "in particular , the inelastic coulomb scattering rate plays an important role in relaxation processes of an injected  electron in the conduction band .",
    "the lifetime of the injected electron , determined by this scattering rate , can be measured by femtosecond time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite the relaxation processes of an injected electron occur through the scattering channels due to different excitations in the system , such as quasiparticle excitations , plasmons , and phonons.@xcite its lifetime provides information on the interactions between the electron and the different excitations .",
    "the relaxation mechanism is important because of its technological relevance , as most semiconductor - based devices operate under high - field and hot - electron conditions.@xcite    on the other hand , tunneling effects have provide new devices formed by coupled q1d doped semiconductors@xcite and attracted considerable theoretical interest because of their fundamental applicability . in this work we present a theoretical study on the inelastic coulomb scattering rates in coupled bi - wire electron gas systems .",
    "a particular attention will be devoted to the effects of weak resonant tunneling .",
    "we find that a weak resonance tunneling can introduce a strong intersubband inelastic coulomb scattering by emitting an acoustic plasmon .",
    "the emission of optical plasmon , on the other hand , is provided by intrasubband scattering of injected electrons .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the theoretical formalism of the inelastic coulomb scattering rates in a multisubband q1d system of coupled quantum wires . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to analyze the inelastic - scattering rates for a bi - wire system in the absence of tunneling between the wires . as an extension of such calculations",
    "we show in sec .",
    "iv the numerical results in the presence of weak resonant tunneling .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec . v.",
    "we consider a two - dimensional system in the @xmath1 plane subjected to an additional confinement in the @xmath2-direction which forms two quantum wires parallel to each other in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the confinement potential in the @xmath2-direction is taken to be of square well type of barrier height @xmath4 and well widths @xmath5 and @xmath6 representing the first and the second wire , respectively .",
    "the potential barrier between the two wires is of width@xmath7 .",
    "the subband energies @xmath8 and the wave functions @xmath9 are obtained from the numerical solution of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation in the @xmath2-direction . we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath10 and define @xmath11 as being the gap between the two subbands .",
    "the interpretation of the index @xmath12depends on tunneling between the two wires .",
    "when there is no tunneling , the wavefunction @xmath13 of the subband @xmath8 is localized in quantum wire @xmath12 . clearly , it is wire index . for two symmetric quantum wires , i.e. ,",
    "@xmath14 one has @xmath15 or @xmath16 when tunneling occurs , the wavefunction of each subband spreads in two quantum wires . in this case , @xmath12 is interpreted as subband index . for two symmetric quantum wires with tunneling ,",
    "the wavefunctions of the two lowest eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric . in this case , the two wires are in the resonant tunneling condition and the gap between the two subbands is denoted by @xmath17 .    in a multisubband q1d system , the inelastic coulomb scattering rate for an injected electron in subband @xmath12 with momentum @xmath18 can be obtained by the imaginary part of the screened exchange self - energy @xmath19 $ ] , @xcite where , @xmath20 is the electron energy with respect to the fermi energy @xmath21 and @xmath22 the electron effective mass . at zero temperature",

    "the screened coulomb potential is related to the dielectric function @xmath26 and the bare electron - electron interaction potential @xmath27 through the equation @xmath28 similarly to the one - band model@xcite , the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) can be separated into the frequency - independent exchange and the correlation part , @xmath29 = \\sigma _ { n}^{ex}(k)+\\sigma _ { n}^{cor}\\left [ k,\\xi _ { n}(k)\\right ] .$ ] the exchange part is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",

    "the frequency integration has already been carried out , since the bare green s function @xmath39 can be written as a dirac delta function of @xmath40 .    for the present coupled quantum wire systems with two occupied subbands ,",
    "the multisubband dielectric function within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) is given by @xmath41 the function @xmath42 is the 1d non - interacting irreducible polarizability at zero temperature for a system free from any impurity scattering . in the presence of impurity scattering , we use mermin s formula @xcite @xmath43 }   \\label{pol2}\\ ] ] to obtain the polarizability including the effect of level broadening through a phenomenological damping constant @xmath44 .",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath45 is calculated by using the numerical solution of the electron wavefunction @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the static lattice dielectric constant , @xmath48 is the electron charge , and @xmath49 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function of the second order .",
    "the electron - electron coulomb interaction describes two - particle scattering events . we observe the following characteristics of the electron - electron coulomb interaction in the coupled quantum wires representing different physical scattering processes : @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent  the scattering in which the electrons keep in their original wires or subbands ; @xmath53 represent the scattering in which both electrons change their wire or subband indices ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56 indicating the scattering in which only one of the electrons suffers the interwire or intersubband transition .  when there is no tunneling , @xmath57 . clearly , they are responsible for tunneling effects .",
    "we also notice that , for two symmetric quantum wires in resonant tunneling , @xmath58 and @xmath56 vanish .",
    "in the following , we will analyze the inelastic coulomb scattering rate of electrons in two coupled symmetric quantum wires ( @xmath59 ) in the absence of tunneling . as we discussed before , when there is no tunneling between two quantum wires , @xmath60 only the coulomb interactions @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 contribute to the electron - electron interaction .",
    "furthermore , the potential @xmath61 and @xmath62 are responsible for the intrawire interaction and @xmath64 due to the symmetry property of the two wires .",

    "therefore , from eqs .",
    "( [ diel ] ) and ( [ diel1 ] ) , we obtain the screened intrawire coulomb potential @xmath68 given by @xmath69[1-(v_{a}-v_{c})\\pi _ { 0}]}.   \\label{vascreened}\\ ] ] the denominator in the above equation is the determinant of the dielectric matrix @xmath70 .",
    "the equation @xmath71 yields the plasmon dispersions of the electron gas system .",
    "the plasmons result in singularities in the screened coulomb potential which are of the most important contribution to the inelastic coulomb scattering rate .    according to eq .",

    "notice that @xmath76 for two symmetric quantum wires .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath77 .  in the absence of tunneling , interwire scattering rates @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 are zero because the transition of an electron from one wire to the other is impossible .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath80 @xmath81 . but the interwire coulomb interaction @xmath63 influences the collective excitations in the system leading to two different plasmon modes , i.e. , the optical and acoustic modes .",
    "subsequently , it affects the inelastic - scattering rates .",
    "we know that the zeros of the two parts @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the denominator in equation ( [ vascreened ] ) yield the optical and acoustic plasmon mode dispersions , respectively .",
    "to understand better the scattering mechanism , we show in fig .",
    "1 the collective excitation dispersion relations of the two coupled symmetric gaas quantum wires of width @xmath84   with different barrier widths . in the calculations",
    ", we consider the barrier height @xmath85 which does not permit tunneling between the wires .",
    "the plasmon modes in fig . 1 correspond to the different scattering channels through which the injected electron can lose energy .",
    "we find a higher ( lower ) frequency plasmon branch which represents the optical ( acoustic ) plasmon mode @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "intrawire quasiparticle excitation continuum @xmath88 ( shadow region ) is also indicated in the figure .",
    "the thin - solid curve is the plasmon dispersion of a single quantum wire with electron density @xmath89 .",
    "it corresponds to the situation in which the distance between the two wires is infinity ( @xmath90 ) or @xmath91 in this case , the plasmon mode is of dispersion relation @xmath92 at @xmath93.@xcite as the distance between the wires decreases , the potential @xmath94 increases .",
    "a finite @xmath63  leads to a gap between the two plasmon modes .",
    "when the two wires are close enough , the acoustic mode develops a linear wave vector dependence . for @xmath93 , @xmath95 with",
    "@xmath96 $ ] where @xmath97 is the fermi velocity and @xmath98 , whereas the optical plasmon still keeps its well - know 1d dispersion relation , @xmath99.@xcite notice that , the interwire coulomb interaction @xmath63 , depending on the distance between the two wires , is responsible for the behavior of the wavevector dependence  of the acoustic mode .",
    "as we will see , this affects significantly the inelastic coulomb scattering rate due to the acoustic plasmons .",
    "2 shows the numerical results of inelastic plasmon scattering rate in the coupled wires corresponding to fig.1(a ) with a very small broadening constant @xmath100 mev .",
    "we observe two scattering peaks .",
    "the lower ( higher ) one is due to the acoustic ( optical ) plasmon scattering .",
    "the abrupt increase of the scattering rate at threshold electron momenta @xmath101 and @xmath102  correspond to the onset of the scattering of the acoustic and optical plasmon modes , respectively .",
    "the higher scattering peak due to the optical plasmon mode is always divergent at the onset @xmath103 and @xmath104 similarly to that in the single wire .",
    "but the behavior of the lower scattering peak is dependent on the distance between the two wires which is directly related to the dispersion relation of the acoustic plasmon mode at small @xmath0 . for small @xmath105",
    "the acoustic mode is of a linear wavevector dependence leading to a finite scattering rate at the onset @xmath106 .",
    "with increasing @xmath107 , the acoustic mode loses its linear @xmath0 dependence resulting in the divergency at the onset of the scattering . in order to clarify such a behavior ,",
    "we show in the inset the energy- vs momentum - loss curve @xmath108 for @xmath109 @xmath110 ( thin - solid curve ) and @xmath111 @xmath110 ( thin - dashed curve ) in the system with @xmath112  . along these curves ,",
    "the momentum and energy conservations are obeyed and the electron relaxation is allowed .",
    "the dispersions of the optical and acoustic plasmon modes @xmath113 and @xmath114 are also given by thick long - dashed curves in the same figure .",
    "for @xmath103 ( @xmath101 ) , the thin - solid ( thin - dashed ) curveintersects the optical ( acoustic ) mode dispersion curve at @xmath115 @xmath116 .",
    "this means that the injected electron with momentum @xmath102 ( @xmath101 ) can emit one optical ( acoustic ) plasmon of frequency @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "notice that , the slopes of the curves @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) are equal at @xmath115 ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "for the optical plasmon mode , the intersection always occurs at finite @xmath124 because the optical plasmon goes as @xmath125 for small @xmath0 .",
    "the divergency due to the optical plasmon scattering is similar to that in the single quantum wire@xcite which is resulted from the coupling of the initial and final states via plasmon emission at @xmath103 .",
    "however , for the acoustic plasmon mode with linear @xmath0-dependence , @xmath126 because @xmath127 at @xmath93 . in this case",
    ", one can obtain @xmath128 .",
    "due to the fact that the plasmon mode is of vanished oscillator strength at @xmath129 , the emission of the acoustic plasmon of the wavevector @xmath130 can not produce divergency in the inelastic - scattering rate . with increasing the distance between the two wires ,",
    "the acoustic plasmon mode loses its linear @xmath0-dependence and approaches to the dispersion of the optical plasmon mode .",
    "consequently , the @xmath123 becomes finite and the scattering rate is divergent at the threshold momentum @xmath101 .  in fig .",
    "3 , we show the scattering rates in the same structures as in fig .",
    "2 but with higher electron density @xmath131@xmath110 .",
    "we see that , in the systems of higher electron density , the scattering threshold shift to larger momentum and the scattering is enhanced .    in fig . 2 and 3 ,",
    "we have not shown the inelastic - scattering rate due to virtual emission of quasiparticles which would occur below the threshold wavevector .",
    "it is known that , in a one - subband quantum wire , the contribution of the quasiparticle excitations to the inelastic coulomb scattering rate is completely suppressed due to the restrictions of the energy and momentum conservations .",
    "consequently , the scattering rate is zero until the onset of the plasmon scattering at a threshold @xmath132 .",
    "@xcite the quasiparticle excitations contribute to the inelastic scattering only when the level broadening is introduced .",
    "these contributions are negligible when the broadening constant is small .",
    "although , in the present case , we are dealing with two coupled quantum wires , the coulomb interaction does not influence the quasiparticle excitations as well as their contributions to the inelastic scattering .",
    "as far as the effect of the phenomenological broadening constant @xmath44 is concerned , we show in fig .",
    "4 the dependence of the inelastic - scattering rate for different @xmath44 .",
    "finite broadening values of @xmath44 in the system give rise to the breaking of translational invariance due to the presence of impurity .",
    "this fact is responsible for relaxing the momentum conservation permitting inelastic scattering via quasiparticle and plasmon excitations for @xmath133 we show such a contribution in the inset of fig .",
    "4 . for @xmath134 @xmath110 , conservation of energy and momentum does not permit opening of any excitation channels .",
    "this means that the injected - electron has infinite lifetime at the fermi surface which has been restored by impurity effects .",
    "in this remaining section , we are going to discuss the effect of weak tunneling on the inelastic coulomb scattering rates in two coupled symmetric quantum wires as have been shown in the previous section .",
    "when the tunneling occurs , a energy gap @xmath135 opens up between the two lowest subbands which have symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions in the @xmath2-direction about the center of the barrier . in this case",
    ", only the subband index is a good quantum number . as we have seen in section ii ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath136 vanish in two symmetric quantum wires in resonant tunneling .",
    "but , @xmath137 is finite and responsible for the tunneling effects on the coulomb scattering . in weak resonant tunneling condition",
    ", one finds @xmath138 .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 and @xmath142 from the above equations and equation ( [ sigma ] ) , we can obtain the inelastic coulomb scattering rates in the presence of tunneling .",
    "we also notice that the zeros of the denominators in equations ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) yield the optical plasmon dispersion and those in equations ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v21 ] ) yield the acoustic plasmon dispersion .",
    "it indicates that the optical plasmons only contribute to the intrasubband scattering @xmath143  and @xmath144 , and the acoustic plasmons to the intersubband scattering @xmath145  and @xmath146 .",
    "we consider two coupled gaas / al@xmath147ga@xmath148as ( @xmath149 mev ) quantum wires of widths @xmath150   separated by a barrier of @xmath151  . in this case , we find @xmath152 mev indicating a very weak resonant tunneling .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5(a ) both inter- and intra - subband scattering rates .",
    "the intrasubband scattering rates @xmath143  and @xmath153 induced by the emission of the optical plasmons , is very similar to that in the absence of tunneling .",
    "it is also not difficult to understand that @xmath154 because , above the threshold of the optical plasmon emission , the plasmon frequency is much larger than @xmath135 and consequently , @xmath155 on the other hand , the tunneling introduces the intersubband scattering rates @xmath145  and @xmath146  and modifies strongly the mechanism of the acoustic plasmon emission . in order to clarify such results , we plot the corresponding acoustic plasmon dispersion relation  in thick - dashed curve in fig . 5(b ) .",
    "the acoustic mode develops a plasmon gap at zero @xmath0 due to the tunneling effect.@xcite the thin lines indicate the intersubband energy- vs momentum - loss curves at the onsets of the acoustic plasmon scattering .",
    "they are determined by conservations of energy and momentum , given by @xmath156 for @xmath157 ( thin - dashed curve ) , and @xmath158 for @xmath159 ( thin - dotted curve ) , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are threshold wavevectors above which the injected electron can be transferred to a different subband by emitting an acoustic plasmon .",
    "the @xmath162 ( thin - dotted curve ) intersects the acoustic plasmon dispersion at small wavevector @xmath163@xmath164 .",
    "the scattering process is similar to the acoustic plasmon scattering in the absence of tunneling as we discussed in the previous section .",
    "but now , the acoustic plasmon mode is of finite frequency with also a finite oscillator strength at @xmath93 resulting in a small divergency at @xmath161 . on the other hand ,",
    "the intersection between the @xmath165 ( thin - dashed curve ) and the acoustic plasmon dispersion occurs at a quite larger wavevector @xmath166 @xmath110 .",
    "the scattering mechanism is more similar to that of the intrasubband scattering and produces a pronounceable divergence at @xmath167 .",
    "finally , we would like to show the tunneling effects on the total inelastic coulomb scattering rates @xmath168 .",
    "6 gives the total scattering rates in ( a ) the absence and ( b ) the presence of tunneling between two quantum wires with @xmath169   and @xmath170  .",
    "we observe that a weak resonant tunneling does not influence much the optical - plasmon scattering , but it does affect strongly acoustic - plasmon scattering .",
    "the acoustic - plasmon scattering for the injected electron in the lowest subband is enhanced significantly and a quite strong scattering peak appears .",
    "for the injected electron in the second subband , tunneling introduces a small divergency in the scattering rate and  shifts the scattering threshold to the lower wavevector .",
    "we have calculated the inelastic coulomb scattering rates of two coupled q1d electron gas systems within the gw approximation .",
    "the screened coulomb potential was obtained within the rpa .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the two quantum wires leads to the optical and acoustic plasmon modes and , consequently , two scattering peaks appear due to the scattering of the two modes .",
    "we found that the scattering of the optical plasmons in two coupled quantum wires is very similar to the plasmon scattering in a single wire because both plasmon modes have similar dispersion relations at small @xmath0.the scattering rate is divergent at the onset of the optical plasmon scattering .",
    "however , the acoustic plasmon mode does not produce such a divergency when it is of a linear @xmath0-dependence at small @xmath0 .",
    "this happens when two wires are close enough .",
    "furthermore , we studied the tunneling effects on the inelastic scattering .",
    "a weak resonant tunneling was introduced between the wires .",
    "such a tunneling lifts the degeneracy of the two subbands originated from two quantum wires and also produces a small plasmon gap on the acoustic mode at @xmath171 moreover , intrersubband scattering appears .",
    "we show that , in this case , the optical plasmons are only responsible for the intrasubband scattering and the acoustic plasmons are for the intersubband scattering . a weak tunneling enhances significantly acoustic plasmon scattering for an injected electron in the lowest subband .",
