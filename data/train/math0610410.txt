    "<S> we consider the lower central filtration of the free associative algebra @xmath0 with @xmath1 generators as a lie algebra . </S>",

    "<S> consider the case where @xmath11 , and put @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> then the assoc@xmath6lie formality conjecture states that the lie cochain complex with the adjoint coefficients @xmath13 is formal as differential graded lie algebra with the gerstenhaber bracket . </S>",
    "<S> this complex plays the role of the hochschild cohomological complex in the case of kontsevich formality theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty in the assoc@xmath6lie formality is to compute the lie algebra cohomology @xmath14 , that is , the analog of polyvector fields . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we conjecturally describe the lie algebra @xmath0 in generators and relations . </S>",
    "<S> this can be considered as the first step in the computation of this cohomology . </S>"
