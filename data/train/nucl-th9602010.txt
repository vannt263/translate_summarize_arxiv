    "some of our most fundamental ideas about charge - symmetry - breaking ( csb ) phenomena in nuclear physics  @xcite are currently being revisited . to a large extent this revision has been prompted by the suggestion of goldman , henderson , and thomas of a suppressed contribution from @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing to the csb component of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction at small momentum transfers  @xcite . since then , many calculations , using a variety of theoretical approaches , have confirmed this suppression  @xcite .",
    "although the issue continues to be controversial  @xcite , the search for alternate csb mechanisms has already started .",
    "indeed , in a recent publication we have proposed isospin breaking in the meson - nucleon vertices as an additional source of isospin violation  @xcite .",
    "we have used isospin breaking in the pion - nucleon coupling constant  @xcite to account for the large isospin violation in the pion - nucleon system reported recently by gibbs , ai , and kaufmann  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "we have studied the impact of isospin violation in the vector - meson  nucleon coupling constants on the difference between the neutron and proton analyzing powers ( @xmath5 ) measured in elastic @xmath6-@xmath7 scattering  @xcite .",
    "we have concluded that the magnitude of the resulting class iv csb potential was consistent with that phenomenologically required by the experiment  @xcite .    however , other csb observables , such as the scattering - length differences of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems  @xcite , and the binding - energy differences of mirror nuclei  the okamoto - nolen - schiffer ( ons ) anomaly  @xcite  are particularly insensitive to the class iv component of the csb potential .",
    "rather , these observables are driven by the class iii component .",
    "indeed , several authors  @xcite have observed that the class iii component of the csb potential ",
    "generated from `` on - shell '' @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing  dominates the binding - energy discrepancy of mirror nuclei and could explain most of the ons anomaly  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the recent developments , we propose to study the ons anomaly in a model which possesses no contribution from @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing ; in our model , the resulting csb potential is generated exclusively from @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing and from isospin violation in the meson - nucleon coupling constants . to compute the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy difference",
    "we employ a realistic three - body wave function obtained from the variational analysis of ref .  @xcite using the reid - soft core potential . to study the ons anomaly in the a=1541 region we use a relativistic mean - field approximation to the walecka model  @xcite .",
    "although the walecka model has been used recently to compute binding - energy differences in mirror nuclei  @xcite , these studies have been limited to the vector sector : coulomb corrections plus on - shell @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing . however , since these contributions are dominated by the timelike part of the vector vertex ( @xmath10 ) they are not particularly sensitive to relativistic effects . in contrast , one expects important relativistic corrections in the pseudoscalar sector because of the structure of the ( @xmath11 ) vertex . examining the role of relativistic effects and of isospin violation in the meson - nucleon coupling constants are two of the major components of the present investigation .",

    "we note , as a consequence of the relativistic factor @xmath51 , the appearance of a contact term [ @xmath61 in all single - meson exchanges ( the contact term is absent from the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing potential because of the additional meson propagator ) . for realistic wave functions  such as the one used here ",
    "the contact term does not contribute to the overlap as a result of the repulsive short - range correlations .",
    "thus , we conclude that all single - meson - exchange potentials generate a repulsive @xmath62 , namely , a csb potential that is attractive(repulsive ) in the @xmath63 channel  in contrast to the experimental observation .",
    "note that this conclusion depends exclusively on the sign of the isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants ; recall that in our model these constants are all positive as a result of the up quark being lighter than the down quark .",
    "this conclusion could change dramatically upon the inclusion of hadronic form factors . with form",
    "factors the contact term gets smeared over a distance of the order of @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 being the cutoff parameter ) and could contribute to the overlap if this distance becomes larger than the size of the repulsive core .",
    "most of our knowledge about hadronic form factor comes from phenomenological fits to a large body of two - nucleon data  @xcite .",
    "these fits reveal hadronic form factors that are typically harder ( @xmath66  gev ) than the corresponding ones extracted from electron - nucleon scattering experiments ( @xmath67  gev ) .",
    "however , the subject of hadronic form factors is highly controversial . indeed , ( model - dependent ) analyses of deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) experiments suggest that the @xmath68 form factor is considerably softer than @xmath69  gev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , holinde and thomas have shown recently that it is possible to obtain an adequate description of two - nucleon data with the softer pion - nucleon form factor ( @xmath70  gev ) suggested by the dis analyses  @xcite .",
    "these authors have also shown that the @xmath23 form factor can also be made softer  but no softer than @xmath71  gev  without compromising the fit .",
    "hence , we find it instructive to do the calculation of the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy shift using , both , the hard form factors of table  [ tableone ] as well as the softer ones suggested by the analyses of refs .  @xcite . in the latter case we fix , for simplicity , both pseudoscalar cutoff parameters at @xmath72  gev and both vector cutoff parameters at @xmath73",
    "we incorporate hadronic form factors into the calculation by modifying the point meson - nucleon coupling in the following way  @xcite :    @xmath74    in table  [ tabletwo ] we report the contribution to the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy difference arising from @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77meson exchange , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we have also included the contribution arising from @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing , with the mixing amplitude fixed at its on - shell value : @xmath78  mev@xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the first column of numbers displays the results in the point - coupling limit .",
    "as suggested , all single meson - exchange potentials give rise to a negative binding - energy shift ; only @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing leads to a positive  albeit very small  contribution .",
    "the binding energy - shifts computed with the bonn b hadronic form factors are reported in table  [ tabletwo ] under the heading of hard form factors .",
    "evidently , the binding - energy shift is very sensitive to the short - distance behavior of the potential ; the inclusion of form factors results in a 40% reduction relative to the point - coupling estimate .",
    "this reduction is best appreciated by plotting the integrand from which @xmath79 is obtained , that is @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ iofa ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ figone ] we display the contribution from one - pion exchange to @xmath80 ; its contribution to @xmath79 for each estimate , which is the area under the curve , appears in parentheses next to its label .",
    "the solid line represents the point - coupling result . in this case",
    "the contact term does not contribute and the integrand is negative - definite over the whole region . as the ( hard ) bonn form factor is introduced (",
    "dashed line ) the smeared contact term dominates the short - distance region and cancels some of the negative contribution arising from the long - range term .",
    "it is then clear that for a sufficiently soft form factor the node in the potential ",
    "arising from the competition between the short- and long - range pieces  could be moved to a large enough distance as to make the integral positive ; this is precisely what is observed when the softer form factor is introduced ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the complete set of numbers with soft form factors has been collected on table  [ tabletwo ] . for completeness",
    "we have also displayed in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] the corresponding integrand for the omega meson .",
    "the same features are evident . in the present case ,",
    "however , the integral is negative in all three cases because the vector form factor remains fairly hard .",
    "nevertheless , we should mention that even for the case of ( perhaps ) unrealistically soft form factors , namely @xmath81  gev and @xmath82  gev , our model can only account for + 40 kev of the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy difference ; a result that is still one standard deviation away from the experimental value .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that an analysis based on @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing and on isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants  but one without @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing  can not describe the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy difference .",
    "however , we have established that this finding is extremely sensitive to the least understood feature of the nn potential , namely , its short - distance structure .",
    "thus , it is difficult to draw any definite conclusion until an accurate determination of the cutoff parameters in the meson - nucleon form factors is made  a very difficult task indeed .",
    "in this section we examine the effect of meson mixing and of isospin violation in the meson - nucleon coupling constants on the binding - energy differences of medium - mass mirror nuclei using a relativistic mean - field approximation to the walecka model  @xcite .",
    "the walecka model is a renormalizable strong - coupling field theory of nucleons interacting via the exchange of scalar and vector mesons .",
    "one of the great virtues of the model is its simplicity .",
    "indeed , already at the mean - field level the walecka model rivals some of the best available nonrelativistic calculations and provides a unified description of various nuclear properties , such as nuclear saturation , the spin - orbit force , and the density dependence of the nuclear interaction .",
    "the mean - field approximation is characterized by the existence of large lorentz scalar and vector components that are responsible for a substantial in - medium enhancement of the small ( lower ) components of the single - particle wave functions ; the so - called @xmath83 effect .      in our model @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing can not contribute to the ons anomaly , at least at @xmath25 . yet , a calculation of binding - energy shifts using the on - shell value for the @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing amplitude is still useful , as it provides a baseline against which alternate csb mechanisms can be tested .",
    "thus , we start this section by computing the impact of the dominant class iii vector - vector component of @xmath27 to the ons anomaly . the purpose of this exercise is to establish the size of the phenomenological gap that will have to be filled by the alternate csb mechanisms .",
    "note that we will not report the contribution to the binding - energy differences arising from the tensor - vector and tensor - tensor terms in eq .",
    "[ vveccsb ] ; for spin - saturated nuclei their numerical impact is small ( typically less than 10% ) .",

    "( [ deltaevec ] ) the sum runs over occupied orbitals in the fermi sea , and we have introduced the fourier transform of the off - diagonal timelike - vector density @xmath87 several remarks are in order .",
    "first , we have ignored the contribution from the dirac sea ( negative - energy states ) in the evaluation of the single - particle spectrum as well as in the csb corrections to the energies .",
    "second , for spherically symmetric nuclei only the timelike part [ @xmath88 of the potential contributes to the hartree term ; for static sources and fields , current conservation prohibits the appearance of a three - vector current  @xcite .",
    "thus , as far as the hartree term is concerned , the csb potential generated from @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing behaves as a short - range coulomb potential .",
    "third , even though the spacelike - part [ @xmath89 of the potential contributes to the fock term , it is of little numerical significance and has been neglected .",

    "is displayed in table  [ tablethree ] .",
    "we have listed separately the contributions arising from isospin violation in the pion - nucleon coupling constant and from @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing  with the former accounting for about 60% of the total .",
    "note that relativistic effects induce an additional enhancement in the binding - energy differences , relative to the nonrelativistic estimates of blunden and iqbal  @xcite . from table",
    "[ tablethree ] one observes that the binding - energy differences from the pseudoscalar sector are comparable  if not larger  than those computed originally with @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing .",
    "indeed , the pseudoscalar sector  alone  accounts for about 70 - 85% of the discrepancy between the nonrelativistic theory and experiment .    to gauge the importance of relativity",
    "we have also computed the binding - energy differences by assuming that the lower component of the wave function is determined from the free - space relation ; the upper component remained unchanged , apart from a small normalization correction .",
    "these `` nonrelativistic '' values appear in parenthesis in table  [ tablefour ] next to the uncorrected numbers .",
    "the relativistic corrections are , indeed , very significant .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the relativistic enhancements  of less than 5%observed for @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing ; recall that only the dominant vector - vector component has been included , which is relatively insensitive to the enhancement of the small components of the wave function .",
    "perhaps the result that best captures the essence of the present analysis is the @xmath105ca-@xmath105k binding - energy difference ( the @xmath106 state in table  [ tablefour ] ) . our baseline value for this difference is 65  kev ; this represents our best attempt at reproducing the result by blunden and iqbal  @xcite , namely , a nonrelativistic calculation with @xmath107 .",
    "however , introducing , both , relativistic corrections and isospin violation in the pion - nucleon coupling constant increases the baseline value to 435  kev ; this represents an enhancement of more than a factor of six .",
    "the above results suggest a large contribution from the pseudoscalar sector to the ons anomaly . yet ,",
    "a definite statement awaits , as these results could be sensitive to off - shell extrapolations .",
    "off - shell ambiguities arise from the fact that different lorentz structures for the @xmath108pseudoscalar - meson vertex  which are all equivalent on - shell  can generate vastly different predictions once the nucleon is off its mass shell . indeed , a pseudoscalar ( @xmath11 ) vertex is very sensitive to the in - medium enhancement of the lower components of the nucleon wave function , while a pseudovector coupling [ @xmath109 is not . in a model",
    "in which chiral symmetry is not explicitly realized  such as the one employed here  a pseudovector @xmath68 coupling seems to be preferred , as it is known to incorporate the correct low - energy pion - nucleon dynamics without sensitive cancellations  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a recent analysis of eta photoproduction data from the nucleon seems to favor a pseudoscalar @xmath34 coupling  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we adopt a pseudovector representation for both ( @xmath68 and @xmath34 ) vertices .",
    "the advantage of such a choice is that it provides us with a lower bound for the binding - energy differences of mirror nuclei within the pseudoscalar sector .",
    "this , combined with the upper bound set by the pseudoscalar representation , should adequately reflect the sensitivity of our results to the various off - shell extrapolations .    for the pseudovector case",
    "the angular - momentum algebra becomes slightly more complicated than before due to the explicit spin dependence of the operator .",
    "recall that in the pseudoscalar case the spin dependence is implicit through the upper - to - lower coupling induced by the pseudoscalar vertex .",
    "the binding - energy shifts computed with a pseudovector @xmath68 coupling are now given by @xmath110 where @xmath111^{2 } \\;.",
    "\\label{curlyfpv}\\ ] ] the pseudovector density has been computed in the static [ @xmath112 limit and is given by @xmath113 \\ ; ;    \\quad ( l_{a}+l_{b}+l={\\rm even } ) \\ ; ,    \\label{rhoabjpv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 note that in the static limit a pseudovector vertex does not induce an off - diagonal coupling .",
    "hence , relativistic effects , which appear as @xmath115 corrections , are negligible .",
    "moreover , the extra factor of @xmath116 that results from the pseudovector coupling is expressed in units of the free nucleon mass @xmath117not in units of @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "[ depv ] ) .",
    "thus , the binding - energy differences computed with a pseudovector vertex could be reproduced with a pseudoscalar vertex  only in the case in which the lower component of the wave function be determined from the free - space relation ( see table  [ tablefour ] ) .",
    "thus , the square of the effective mass in the medium relative to its free space value ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) should serve as an indicator of the sensitivity of the approach to the various off - shell extrapolations . note that in a mean - field approximation to the walecka model @xmath118 is typically of the order of 40% .",
    "thus , off - shell ambiguities are expected to be large ( see table  [ tablefive ] ) .    the pseudovector contribution to the binding - energy difference of mirror nuclei",
    "is displayed , alongside the pseudoscalar results , in table  [ tablefive ] .",
    "as suggested previously , these results are very close to those obtained in table  [ tablefour ] using the free upper - to - lower ratio .",
    "more significantly , however , is the very dramatic reduction in the binding - energy differences relative to the pseudoscalar results . indeed , while a calculation with a pseudoscalar vertex accounts for about 70 - 85% of the ons anomaly , only 30% of it can be explained with a pseudovector vertex .",
    "it is important to stress that although some theoretical guidelines do exist , off - shell ambiguities might be difficult to resolve given that the contribution from the isospin - violating part of the potential to hadronic observables is small .",
    "binding - energy differences of mirror nuclei have been computed in a model that includes two sources of charge - symmetry - breaking in the nn potential ; isoscalar - isovector mixing in the meson propagator and isospin violation in the meson - nucleon coupling constants . for the vector - meson sector",
    "we have used a vmd - inspired model .",
    "thus , on the basis of this assumption  but little else  we concluded that neither @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing nor the dominant vector - vector component of the vector - meson - exchange potential can contribute to the binding - energy discrepancy between theory and experiment . in models of this sort",
    "this conclusion seems unavoidable  as gauge invariance forces , both , the @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing amplitude and the isospin - violating vector coupling to vanish at @xmath25 .",
    "this is in contrast to previous analyses that employed the on - shell value of the @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing amplitude to explain the bulk of the ons anomaly  @xcite .",
    "hence , in our model the anomaly must be explained exclusively in terms of @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing and of isospin violation in the pion- , rho- , and omega - nucleon coupling constants .    to compute the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy difference a nonrelativistic estimate of the @xmath47 component of the csb potential was obtained . in our model",
    "all sources of csb generate a @xmath47 interaction with a long - range part that is attractive in the @xmath8 channel and repulsive in the @xmath9 channel .",
    "this result is robust , as it only depends on the sign of the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing amplitude and on the sign of the isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants ; recall that in our model the latter is determined from the up - down quark mass difference , which we assume to be negative .",
    "the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy difference , however , was seen to be very sensitive to the short - distance behavior of the potential .",
    "indeed , the binding - energy difference emerged from a delicate interplay between the short- and long - range parts of the potential .",
    "this interplay introduces a node in the csb potential which can be shifted to a large enough distance as to make the binding - energy difference almost consistent with experiment .",
    "we stress that the ( almost ) agreement with experiment could only be achieved at the expense of introducing unrealistically soft form factors .    for the medium - mass ( a=1541 ) region we computed the binding - energy difference of mirror nuclei in a relativistic mean - field approximation to the walecka model . due to the larger size of the system , relative to @xmath4he ,",
    "our results were fairly insensitive to the short - distance structure of the potential .",
    "moreover , explicit spin - dependent effects are known to be small for these spin - saturated nuclei . as a consequence ,",
    "the numerical impact from the vector - meson sector on the ons anomaly was seen to be small .",
    "we proposed pseudoscalar - meson exchange as an alternate mechanism to explain the ons anomaly in the medium - mass region .",
    "we computed binding - energy differences that were comparable  and in most cases larger  than those obtained from previous estimates using on - shell @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing .",
    "we have concluded that the pseudoscalar sector  alone ",
    "could explain about 70 - 85% of the ons anomaly .",
    "two effects , ignored until now , were responsible for these findings : a ) the inclusion of isospin violation in the pion - nucleon coupling constant , and b ) relativity , which enhances the small components of the bound - state wave functions relative to their free - space value .",
    "we reached these conclusions by assuming a pseudoscalar coupling for , both , the @xmath68 and @xmath34 vertices . yet",
    "other choices  all of them equivalent on - shell  are possible ; such as pseudovector coupling .",
    "there is no definite prescription on how to take the csb potential off - shell .",
    "moreover , this issue is complicated further by the fact that chiral symmetry favors a pseudovector representation for the @xmath68 vertex while a recent analysis of @xmath1-photoproduction data seems to suggest a pseudoscalar @xmath34 coupling . hence , to gauge the sensitivity of our results to the various off - shell extrapolations we repeated the calculation by adopting a pseudovector representation for both vertices .",
    "we concluded that the off - shell ambiguities were large ; while 70 - 85% of the anomaly could be explained with a pseudoscalar coupling only 30% of it could be accounted for with a pseudovector vertex .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have used a vmd - inspired model to examine the effect of isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants and of @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing on the binding - energy difference of mirror nuclei .",
    "we could account for most of the @xmath4he-@xmath4h binding - energy difference ",
    "provided very soft form factors were assumed .",
    "moreover , we could explain the ons anomaly in the medium - mass region  provided a pseudoscalar representation was adopted .",
    "based on these findings we expect that the okamoto - nolen - schiffer anomaly will remain  even after more than a quarter of a century  the source of considerable theoretical debate .",
