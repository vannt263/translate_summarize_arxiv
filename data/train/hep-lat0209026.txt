    "study of quark gluon plasma using finite - temperature lattice qcd has seen a remarkable progress over the last decade .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is one of the most studied topics , for which many calculations have been reported and have made clear the effects of dynamical quarks @xcite .",
    "however , most studies on eos in full qcd are made for the temporal lattice size of @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and a reliable continuum extrapolation of eos is prevented by large scale violation present for small @xmath6 .",
    "recently , the cp - pacs collaboration proposed the use of anisotropic lattice for calculations of eos .",
    "this proposal was tested for the pure gluon system @xcite , for which a well - controlled continuum extrapolation of eos was performed for the first time .",
    "we wish to extend the use of anisotropic lattice to calculations of eos for full qcd .",
    "this requires a tuning of the bare gauge and quark anisotropy parameters which corresponds to a given value of the anisotropy . in this paper",
    "we report results of such a tuning .",
    "we adopt an o(a)-improved wilson quark action coupled with an rg - improved action for gluons .",
    "this combination of actions has been adopted in a series of systematic investigations at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it also shows better scaling properties in finite - temperature qcd , _",
    "e.g. _ , the expected o(4 ) scaling is observed around @xmath8 @xcite .    here , we extend the study to anisotropic lattices .",
    "we focus on the anisotropy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the spatial and temporal lattice spacings , respectively .",
    "this choice of @xmath12 is based on a study of efficiency in calculations of eos as described in our previous study in quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "we consider the following gauge action which includes plaquette , @xmath13 , and rectangle loop , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 . carrying out the rg improvement program of ref .",
    "@xcite on this action , we find that a simple choice @xmath18 , which is the same as for the isotropic case , sufficiently improves the theory for small anisotropy @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the quark action we study is as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 @xmath21 the bare anisotropy @xmath22 of the fermion field is defined by the ratio of the spatial and the temporal hopping parameters , @xmath23 .",
    "we set the wilson parameter to be @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the hopping parameters are related to the bare quark mass as @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "we also define @xmath3 by @xmath26 .",
    "this parameter plays the same role as @xmath3 on the isotropic lattice . for free fermion , equating the rest and the kinetic masses leads to @xmath27 when @xmath24 @xcite .    for the field strength @xmath28",
    ", we use the standard clover - leaf definition . at the tree level ,",
    "the coefficients of the clover terms , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are unity .",
    "we incorporate the mean - field improvement , @xmath31 ( @xmath321,2,3 ) and @xmath33 , with the spatial mean - field factor defined with the plaquette in 1-loop perturbation theory @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for the temporal mean - field .",
    "to realize a consistent anisotropy , the bare anisotropy parameters @xmath22 and @xmath36 for fermion and gauge fields have to be calibrated , such that the anisotropy @xmath37 calculated in the fermionic sector coincides with @xmath38 calculated in the gluonic sector .",
    "we perform this calibration as follows . calculating @xmath39 for some parameter sets of @xmath40 at a fixed @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    ", we make a fit of results with linear functions of @xmath22 and @xmath36 , and locate the point satisfying @xmath41 , where @xmath42 in our case .",
    "this point is denoted as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which are functions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    for the determination of @xmath38",
    ", we adopt klassen s method @xcite of matching the wilson loop ratios according to @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are spatial - spatial and spatial - temporal wilson loop , respectively .",
    "for @xmath37 we use the relativistic dispersion relation of mesons , and demand @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are in units of @xmath11 , while the spatial momentum @xmath51 is in units of @xmath10 .",
    "the latter is defined with @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath54 and its permutations .",
    "we evaluate @xmath37 using either pseudoscalar or vector mesons .",
    "the results are referred to as @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( and also @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) for the calibrated bare anisotropies .",
    "simulations are made with the hmc algorithm for two flavors of degenerate quarks , using an even - odd preconditioned bicgstab quark solver .",
    "the calibration is performed at @xmath59 and @xmath60 on a @xmath61 and @xmath62 lattice , respectively .",
    "six values of @xmath3 are used at each @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "measurements are performed at every 5 trajectories up to 1000  1700 trajectories after 300 thermalization trajectiries .",
    "errors are estimated by the jackknife method with bins of 50 trajectories , and error propagation is used in the fitting to @xmath42 .",
    "if the lattice scale is estimated from the sommer scale @xmath65fm , the typical lattice size in the spatial direction is about 2.0 fm ( 2.3 fm ) at @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for @xmath68 .",
    "figure 1 shows the results for @xmath44 and @xmath69 as a function of @xmath70 at each @xmath2 . unlike the case of quenched calculation @xcite , where @xmath69 shows no linear terms in @xmath71 , linear terms are important in full qcd even with the choice @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the results are fitted with a general quadratic function of @xmath72 and @xmath70 , @xmath73 .",
    "figure 2 represents the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "non - vanishing values of this quantity represnets an @xmath74 lattice artifacts for our action choice .",
    "we confirm that the difference tends to zero ( less than 5 % for @xmath75 ) as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "we plan to use this difference to estimate systematic errors in continuum extrapolations .",
