    "1996 , hui et al .",
    "1993 , israel 1998 , ebneter & balick 1983 , de vaucouleurs 1979 ) and exhibits a very prominent dust lane .",
    "centaurus a is a strong radio galaxy with a milliarcsecond nuclear continuum source ( kellermann et al .",
    "1997 ; shaffer & schilizzi 1975 ; kellermann 1974 ) and two giant radio lobes . absorption against the nuclear source has been found in hi ( van der hulst et al . 1983 ) and many molecular species and transitions ( gardner & whiteoak 1976 ; whiteoak & gardner 1971 ; bell & seaquist 1988 ; seaquist & bell 1986 , 1990 ; phillips et al . 1987 ; eckart et al . 1990a ; israel et al . 1990 , 1991 ; wild et al . 1997 ; wiklind & combes 1997 ) .",
    "several studies of centaurus  a in the millimeter wavelength range have been carried out .",
    "although other elliptical galaxies with dust lanes have recently been detected in co ( sage & galleta 1993 ) , centaurus is the best object for a detailed study due to its proximity and corresponding large angular size .",
    "phillips et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and quillen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) observed several positions in the co(2 - 1 ) line along the dust lane at a resolution of 30@xmath4 .",
    "in previous papers we presented a fully sampled map of the @xmath9co(1 - 0 ) emission together with _ iras _ observations of the fir continuum ( eckart et al .",
    "1990b ) , measurements of the millimeter absorptions lines towards the nucleus ( eckart et al . 1990a ; see also wiklind & combes 1997 ) , and a @xmath9co(2 - 1 ) map along the dust lane at a resolution of 22@xmath4 ( rydbeck et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in wild et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we presented the first fully sampled @xmath10co(1 - 0 ) map along the dust lane of centaurus  a , as well as single spectra of the @xmath10co(2 - 1 ) emission in the disk and c@xmath11o(1 - 0 ) emission at the central position .",
    "these new data allowed us , in combination with the @xmath9co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath9co(2 - 1 ) maps obtained earlier , to study the excitation conditions of the molecular gas in detail throughout the dust lane . using different co line ratios and their variation across the disk of centaurus a , we inferred the physical parameters of the molecular ism and their spatial variations .    here",
    "we extend our investigation to the very dense ( 10@xmath2 to 10@xmath6@xmath1 ) phase of the molecular gas by observing line emission of the density tracers hcn and cs towards the nucleus and the off - nuclear dust lane in centaurus  a.    .observational parameters [ cols=\"<,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     masses have been derived via line luminosities and eqs . 2 and 3 .",
    "systematic errors are + 150% and -50% for @xmath12 and @xmath340% for @xmath13 .",
    "the total masses have been derived assuming that the off - center measurements are representative for all of the dust lane which is 180@xmath14 in length in the co(1 - 0 ) map ( eckart et al .",
    "1990a ) .",
    "[ firhcn ] shows that centaurus  a has the same ratio of fir to hcn luminosity as ulirgs and normal spirals , including the milky way .",
    "this is also true for the center and the off - positions in the dust lane .",
    "this suggests that in cen  a the star formation rate per mass of _ dense _ gas is in good approximation independent on the position and infrared luminosity within the dust lane .",
    "detailed observations ( lee et al . 1990 ) of galactic gmc s show that the average cs(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) intensity ratio is @xmath51/300 . since hcn(1 - 0 ) is usually 1.5 to 2 times stronger than cs(2 - 1 ) and has larger source sizes solomon et al .",
    "( 1992 ) adopt an hcn(1 - 0)/co(1 - 0 ) ratio of @xmath51/100 for the molecular ring in the galactic disk .",
    "this results in a hcn luminosity for the milky way of about 4@xmath1510@xmath16 k  km  s@xmath17pc@xmath18 which is quite comparable to what we find for centaurus  a with 5.5@xmath1510@xmath16 k  km  s@xmath17pc@xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "[ fraction ] we show the position of centaurus  a in a plot of @xmath19 which measures the fraction of dense gas and @xmath20 which measures the efficiency with which molecular gas is transformed into ob stars ( solomon et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this plot includes ulirgs as well as normal and infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "we find that as a whole cen  a fits very well into this correlation and is located between both groups .",
    "this is also true for the disk at angular separations of about 60@xmath4 and 90@xmath4 from the center .",
    "however , towards the nucleus the fraction of dense molecular gas measured via the line luminosity ratio l(hcn)/l(co ) as well as the star formation efficiency l@xmath21/l@xmath22 is more comparable to ulirgs rather than normal and infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "this suggests that most of the fir luminosity of centaurus  a originates in regions of very dense molecular gas and high star formation efficiency .",
    "the hcn line luminosity can now be used to estimate the amount of dense ( 10@xmath2 @xmath1 ) gas via eq .",
    "( 2 ) . from the hcn line luminosity",
    "we find a total mass of molecular gas that must be at densities @xmath2310@xmath2@xmath1 of @xmath24m@xmath25 .",
    "this has to be compared to the total molecular gas mass derived from the @xmath9co(1 - 0 ) line of 2@xmath1510@xmath26m@xmath25 ( eckart et al .",
    "the comparison shows that a large fraction - approximately one third - but at least one sixth - of the molecular line emission in cen  a must originate from sites with abundant dense molecular gas .",
    "the ratio of molecular gas mass at densities of @xmath2310@xmath2@xmath1 to gas at @xmath5300@xmath1 is about 1/20 in the galaxy and almost unity for ulirgs ( solomon et al .",
    "based on this quantity the physical conditions of the dense molecular ism in cen  a are apparently closer to those of ulirgs than to our milky way .",
    "the presence of a large amount of dense molecular gas is also supported by the fact that if one multiplies @xmath12 by the mean galactic @xmath27 ratio of 71  @xmath28 ( solomon et al .",
    "1992 ) one obtains about 6@xmath1510@xmath29l@xmath25  which equals the observed fir luminosity .",
    "the implicite assumption here is that the mean galactic conversion factor is applicable . accepting this",
    ", the result implies that active star formation in the dust lane of cen  a is the actual source of its fir luminosity and that the agn which is responsible for strong radio and x - ray radiation is not contributing substantially .",
    "the cs(2 - 1 ) and cs(3 - 2 ) lines trace even denser molecular gas at 10@xmath6@xmath1 .",
    "the problem is that cs line emission is quite weak .",
    "detections of cs in extra - galactic sources are sparse . in the sample of normal and interacting galaxies and ulirgs solomon et al.(1992 ) detected cs line emission only in arp  220 .",
    "for cen  a we find a total cs(3 - 2 ) line luminosity of @xmath30 .",
    "the ratio of the cs to co line luminosity is then @xmath31 , very similar to the value of 1/250 given by solomon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for the milky way .",
    "for the galactic center the same authors derive a corresponding ratio of about 1/20 to 1/30 .",
    "this indicates that the galactic center is approximately 8 to 10 times more luminous in the cs(3 - 2 ) line that the molecular gas in the disk . at the center of cen",
    "a the @xmath32 is 2 times higher compared to the off - center dust lane measurement .    the cs(3 - 2 ) line luminosity results in a total mass estimate of gas at densities of 10@xmath6@xmath1 of about @xmath33 = ( 2 - 8)@xmath1510@xmath34m@xmath25 .",
    "this number is in very good agreement with the corresponding value derived from the hcn(1 - 0 ) line emission .",
    "while the line luminosities of the hcn(1 - 0 ) and cs(3 - 2 ) as well as the fir luminosity of the molecular gas in the dust lane of cen  a are quite comparable to each other there are definite differences in the overall fraction of dense molecular gas and the efficiency with which stars are formed from it .",
    "this star formation activity is also the source of the fir luminosity of cen  a. about 40% or even more of the total molecular line luminosity in cen  a originates in dense gas .",
    "this suggests that star formation as well as the bulk of the dense molecular gas is mostly concentrated in gmc complexes rather than in a more diffuse molecular gas component .",
    "this is already indicated by the ring - like distribution of hii region found by graham ( 1979 ) as well as the mem deconvolved @xmath9co(2 - 1 ) line emission mass by rydbeck et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "we also note that with respect to other positions in the dust lane the i(hcn)/i(co ) ratio is larger at separations of about 100@xmath4 from the nucleus rather than at separations of about 60@xmath4 .",
    "the larger distance is close to the inner edge of the ring of hii regions and corresponds well with the position of the folds in the warped molecular gas disk of centaurus  a ( quillen et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ; sparke 1996 ) and an increased intensity in the 15@xmath35 m continuum dust emission ( block & sauvage 2000 ; mirabel et al . 1999 )",
    ". therefore a higher i(hcn)/i(co ) ratio may be due to a combination of enhanced star formation efficiency at these positions and an increase in column density due to the folds . due to the low intrinsic velocity dispersion of the thin molecular disk ( quillen et al .",
    "1992 ) and due to the fact that the @xmath9co line emission is originating in optically thick molecular gas ( wild et al .",
    "1997 ) this may lead to shadowing of molecular clouds along the line of sight toward the folds .",
    "this effect will be stronger for @xmath9co than for the small , dense cloud cores seen in the less abundant hcn line emission .",
    "this effect may therefore lead to an intensity decrease in the @xmath9co line and an increase in the hcn(1 - 0 ) line , resulting in the observed variation of the i(hcn)/i(co ) line ratio .",
    "future interferometric measurements will allow us to study the distribution of molecular gas in the dust lane of centaurus  a in much greater detail .",
    "line ratios , luminosities and star formation can then be investigated for individual gmc complexes .",
