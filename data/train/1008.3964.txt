    "in this paper we give a general method for gluing semiclassical resolvent estimates . as an application we obtain the following theorem .",
    "[ t : intro ] let @xmath0 be an even asymptotically hyperbolic riemannian manifold . let @xmath1 suppose that the trapped set of @xmath2 , i.e. the set of maximally extended geodesics which are precompact , is either normally hyperbolic in the sense of  [ s : wz ] or hyperbolic with negative topological pressure at @xmath3 ( see  [ s : nz ] ) .",
    "then the cutoff resolvent @xmath4 continues analytically from @xmath5 to @xmath6-i[0,\\gamma h]$ ] for every @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where it obeys the bound @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are both determined only by the trapped set .",
    "moreover , for @xmath12 $ ] we have for some @xmath13 the following quantitative limiting absorption principle : @xmath14    by an _ even asymptotically hyperbolic manifold _ we mean that @xmath2 is the interior of @xmath15 , a compact manifold with boundary , and @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a boundary defining function and @xmath18 is a family of metrics on @xmath19 , smooth up to @xmath19 , is a 2-cotensor which is a metric on @xmath19 when restricted to @xmath19 : see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.1 ) . ] and even in @xmath20 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 1.2 ) for a more invariant way to phrase this last condition ) .",
    "the assumptions on the trapped set will be discussed in more detail in  [ s : trapped ] , but for now we remark that it suffices to take @xmath2 negatively curved with a trapped set consisting of a single closed geodesic . moreover ,",
    "the compact part of the manifold on which the trapping occurs can be replaced by a domain with several convex obstacles .",
    "[ s : apps ] for a stronger result .",
    "as already stated our methods work in much greater generality .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete riemannian manifold , @xmath21 a semiclassical schrdinger operator , @xmath22 bounded , @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath24 is essentially self - adjoint , @xmath25 is holomorphic in @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , in this set one has uniform estimates on @xmath27 as @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 .    on the other hand , as @xmath30 approaches the spectrum , @xmath31 is necessarily not uniformly bounded ( even for a single @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , in many settings , e.g. on asymptotically euclidean or hyperbolic spaces with a suitable decay assumption on @xmath33 , the resolvent extends continuously to the spectrum ( perhaps away from some thresholds ) , although only as an operator on weighted @xmath34-spaces . indeed under more restrictive assumptions it continues meromorphically across the continuous spectrum , typically to a riemann surface ramified at thresholds : see e.g. @xcite for a general discussion .",
    "it is very useful in this setting to obtain semiclassical resolvent estimates , i.e.  estimates as @xmath28 , both at the spectrum of @xmath24 and for the analytic continuation of the resolvent , @xmath31 . by scaling ,",
    "these imply high energy resolvent estimates for non - semiclassical schrdinger operators , which in turn can be used , for instance , to describe wave propagation , or more precisely the decay of solutions of the wave equation : see  [ s : apps ] for examples of such applications in our setting . for this purpose",
    "the most relevant estimates are those in a strip near the real axis for the non - semiclassical problem ( which gives exponential decay rates for the wave equation ) , which translates to estimates in an @xmath35 neighborhood of the real axis for semiclassical problems .",
    "the best estimates one can expect ( on appropriate weighted spaces ) are @xmath36 ; this corresponds to the fact that this problem is semiclassically of real principal type .",
    "however , if there is trapping , i.e.  some trajectories of the hamilton flow ( or , in case @xmath37 , geodesics ) do not escape to infinity , the estimates can be significantly worse ( exponentially large : see @xcite ) even at the real axis . nonetheless , if the trapping is mild , e.g.  the trapped set is hyperbolic , then one has polynomial , @xmath38 , bounds in certain settings , see the work of nonnenmacher - zworski @xcite , petkov - stoyanov @xcite , and wunsch - zworski @xcite",
    ". moreover , on the real axis ( i.e. for @xmath39 with @xmath40 ) @xcite prove @xmath41 bounds , which work of bony - burq - ramond @xcite shows to be optimal when any trapping is present .    that @xmath36 bounds hold in strips for nontrapping asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds",
    "was proved by the second author in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this result , along with the accompanying propagation of singularities theorem , is what makes it possible to use our gluing method to prove theorem [ t : intro ] ; see  [ s : ahinfinity ] for a discussion of how to .",
    "typically , for the settings in which one can prove polynomial bounds in the presence of trapping , one considers particularly convenient models in which one alters the problem away from the trapped set , e.g.  by adding a complex absorbing potential .",
    "the natural expectation is that if one can prove such bounds in a thus altered setting , one should also have the bounds if one alters the operator in a different non - trapping manner , e.g.  by gluing in a euclidean end or another non - trapping infinity . in spite of this widespread belief ,",
    "no general prior results exist in this direction , though in some special cases this has been proved using partially microlocal techniques , e.g.  in work of christianson @xcite on resolvent estimates where the trapping consists of a single hyperbolic orbit , and in the work of the first author @xcite , combining the estimates of nonnenmacher - zworski @xcite with the microlocal non - trapping asymptotically euclidean estimates of the second author and zworski @xcite as well as the more delicate non - microlocal estimates of burq @xcite and cardoso - vodev @xcite .",
    "another example is work of the first author @xcite using an adaptation of the method of complex scaling to glue in another class of asymptotically hyperbolic ends to the estimates of sjstrand - zworski @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out , however , that in the present paper we glue the resolvent estimates _ directly _ , without the need for any information on how they were obtained , so for instance we do not need to construct a global escape function , etc .",
    "in addition to the above listed references , bruneau - petkov @xcite give a general method for deducing weighted resolvent estimates from cutoff resolvent estimates , but they require that the operators in the cutoff estimate and the weighted estimate be the same .",
    "in this paper we show how one can achieve this gluing in general , in a robust manner .",
    "the key point is the following .",
    "one can not simply use a partition of unity to combine the trapping model with a new ` infinity ' because the problem is not semiclassically elliptic .",
    "thus , semiclassical singularities ( i.e. lack of decay as @xmath28 ) propagate along null bicharacteristics . however , under a convexity assumption on the gluing region , which holds for instance when gluing in asymptotically euclidean or hyperbolic models , following these singularities microlocally allows us to show that an appropriate three - fold iteration of this construction , which takes into account the bicharacteristic flow , gives a parametrix with @xmath42 errors .",
    "this in turn allows us to show that the resolvent of the glued operator satisfies a polynomial estimate , and that on asymptotically euclidean and hyperbolic manifolds the order of growth is given by that of the model operator for the trapped region .",
    "we state our general assumptions and main result precisely in the next section , and prove the result in  [ s : proof ] . in  [ s : infinity ] we will show how our assumptions near infinity are satisfied for various asymptotically euclidean and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds . in  [ s : trapped ] we show how our assumptions near the trapped set are satisfied for various types of hyperbolic trapping . in  [ s : apps ] we give applications : a more precise version of theorem [ t : intro ] , exponential decay for the wave equation , and local smoothing for the schrdinger propagator .",
    "we are very grateful to maciej zworski for his suggestion , which started this project , that resolvent gluing should be understood much better , and for his interest in this project .",
    "thanks also to both anonymous referees for their useful comments .",
    "before stating the abstract assumptions of our main theorem , we review some terminology from semiclassical analysis . for @xmath43 a symbol supported in a coordinate patch , @xmath44 compactly supported in the patch , @xmath45 on a neighborhood of the projection to @xmath2 of the support of @xmath46 , @xmath47 is a semiclassical quantization given in local coordinates by @xmath48 see , for example , @xcite for more information .",
    "we also say that a family of functions @xmath49 on @xmath2 is polynomially bounded if @xmath50 for some @xmath51 .",
    "the semiclassical wave front set , @xmath52 , is defined for polynomially bounded @xmath53 as follows : for @xmath54 , @xmath55 iff there exists @xmath56 with @xmath57 such that @xmath58 ( in @xmath34 ) .",
    "one can also extend the definition to @xmath59 ( thought of as the cosphere bundle at fiber - infinity in @xmath60 ) by considering @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the fiber - radial compactification of @xmath60 with @xmath57 for @xmath63 ; then @xmath64 implies @xmath65 ( in @xmath34 ) .",
    "let @xmath15 be a compact manifold with boundary , @xmath66 a complete metric on @xmath2 ( the interior of @xmath15 ) , and @xmath67 a semiclassical schrdinger operator on @xmath2 with @xmath68 .",
    "we have no further explicit conditions on the potential @xmath33 , although the dynamical assumption and the assumptions on the resolvents below will in practice restrict the potentials the theorem applies to .",
    "let @xmath20 be a boundary defining function , and let @xmath69 recall that a bicharacteristic of @xmath24 is an integral curve in @xmath60 of the hamiltonian vector field associated to the hamiltonian function @xmath70 , and that the energy of a bicharacteristic is the level set of @xmath71 in which it lies .",
    "suppose that the bicharacteristics @xmath72 of @xmath24 ( by this we always mean bicharacteristics at energy in some fixed range @xmath6 $ ] ) satisfy the convexity assumption @xmath73 in @xmath74 .",
    "in particular this rules out the possibility of any trapped trajectory entering @xmath74 . there may be more complicated behavior , including trapping , in @xmath75 .",
    "[ rem : constants ] if @xmath20 is a boundary defining function , @xmath76 is a @xmath77 function on @xmath78 with @xmath79 , and @xmath20 satisfies then so does @xmath80 .",
    "in particular the specific constants above ( as well as intermediate constants used below ) are chosen only for convenience , and can be replaced by arbitrary constants so long as the ordering of the constants is preserved .",
    "let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be model differential operators on @xmath74 and @xmath83 respectively : @xmath84 the spaces @xmath85 on which the operators @xmath86 are globally defined can differ from @xmath2 away from @xmath87 , as the operators will always be multiplied by a smooth cutoff function to the appropriate @xmath87 .",
    "assume however that no bicharacteristic of @xmath82 leaves @xmath83 and then returns later , i.e. that @xmath88 note that we do not assume that the @xmath86 are self - adjoint ; this is useful in the applications in   [ s : trapped][s : apps ] .",
    "however , the condition makes @xmath86 formally self - adjoint on @xmath87 and in particular has real semiclassical symbol on @xmath89 , as a result of which bicharacteristics of @xmath86 are well defined on @xmath89 .",
    "note that one difference from the ( in some ways related ) `` black - box '' approach of sjstrand - zworski @xcite is that for us @xmath90 will typically not be a compact manifold .    in some applications",
    "we may wish to divide @xmath60 , rather than simply @xmath2 , into two overlapping regions with a different model operator on each one . to do this",
    "it is enough to take @xmath20 to be a more general function in @xmath91 , rather than a boundary defining function for @xmath92 as we do here . in that case",
    "@xmath42 error terms appear in the formulas in , and in several other formulas below , but the construction is essentially the same . for simplicity of exposition we do not pursue this level of generality further below .",
    "let @xmath93 , @xmath94 be bounded functions , referred to as _ weights _ ( in typical applications they may be compactly supported , decaying at infinity , or constant ) such that @xmath95 on @xmath96 and @xmath97 on @xmath83 .",

    "however , for brevity , we use the term ` semiclassically outgoing ' in place of ` off - diagonally semiclassically outgoing ' throughout the paper . _",
    "a reason for making the weaker hypothesis of being off - diagonally semiclassically outgoing is that it is sometimes easier to check : typically the schwartz kernel of @xmath120 is simpler away from the diagonal than at the diagonal ( where it may be a semiclassical paired lagrangian distribution ) , and the off - diagonal outgoing property follows easily from the oscillatory nature of the schwartz kernel there ; see the third paragraph of  [ s : infinity ] .",

    "the ( mild ) difference with previous authors is that we obtain the analytic continuation and the resolvent estimates for the resolvent with exponential weights ( as in ",

    "this follows from the substitution @xmath618 on the other hand , work of mazzeo - melrose @xcite and guillarmou @xcite ( see also @xcite ) shows that the weighted resolvent @xmath619 continues meromorphically to @xmath620 .",

    "note that the sum in is finite , thanks to the resonance free strip established by the estimate .",
    "this is a standard consequence of the resolvent estimate and the meromorphic continuation , by taking a fourier transform in time and then performing a contour deformation .",

    "the proof then proceeds by contour deformation from @xmath632 to @xmath633 .",
    "the residues at the poles of the resolvent produce the terms of the expansion in , and the resolvent estimate @xmath634 for any @xmath635 , justifies the deformation and controls the @xmath636 norm of the error ( on compact sets , or in suitably weighted spaces ) in terms of the @xmath637 norm of @xmath66 .",
    "the estimate can be derived from the @xmath416 estimate following the same procedure as in  [ s : ahinfinity ] above .",

    "consequently , in that setting ( and probably in general ) , theorem  [ t : logloss ] is optimal .    from theorem  [ t : logloss ]",
    "it follows by a standard @xmath645 argument as in @xcite that the schrdinger propagator exhibits local smoothing with loss : @xmath646 for any @xmath647 .",
    "in fact , the main resolvent estimate of @xcite follows from theorem [ t : main ] above , because the model operator near infinity , @xmath81 can be taken to be a nontrapping scattering schrdinger operator , for which the necessary resolvent and propagation estimates were proved in @xcite .",
    "moreover , burq - guillarmou - hassell @xcite show that when @xmath648 semiclassical resolvent estimates with logarithmic loss can be used to deduce strichartz estimates with no loss on a scattering manifold ( a manifold with asymptotically euclidean or asymptotically conic ends in a sense which generalizes that of  [ s : aeinfinity ] ) , and the same result probably holds on the asymptotically hyperbolic spaces considered here .",
    "see also @xcite for more references and a discussion of the history and of recent developments in local smoothing and strichartz estimates .",
    "another possible application of the method is to give alternate proofs of cutoff resolvent estimates in the presence of trapping , where the support of the cutoff is disjoint from the trapping .",
