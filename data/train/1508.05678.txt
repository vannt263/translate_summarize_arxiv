    "recently , there has been renewed interest in theories of gravity with higher derivative terms , particularly , in the case of theories containing quadratic terms in the curvature ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that in string theory an infinite series of higher curvature correction to general relativity arise naturally .",
    "the inclusion of some of these terms makes the gravitational theory under consideration renormalizable but the truncation of the series to an effective field theory is done at the cost of introducing a massive ghost degree of freedom . at quadratic order , this state appears due to the presence of terms which are the square of the riemann , ricci or weyl tensors , only two of these are independent since the euler density does not contribute to the equations of motion . ]",
    "the case of @xmath2 gravity is particularly interesting , since after a field redefinition it can be rewritten as general relativity with a minimally coupled scalar field with a self interaction . in the context of cosmology starobinsky",
    "considered the simplest modification to gr , the case of @xmath3 , and it was shown that the effective potential for the scalar degree of freedom has a structure that is very ad hoc for the study of cosmic inflation . indeed , it describes a slow roll transition from a de sitter phase to a flat minkowski phase @xcite , leading to a possible realization of an inflationary era in the early universe .",
    "even more , cosmological scenarios have been investigated embedding this model in the context of supergravity theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "contrary to other higher derivative extensions , @xmath4 gravity is ghost - free .",
    "the theory along with a massless graviton also propagates a massive scalar degree of freedom usually called scalaron field @xcite .",
    "even though in higher derivative modified gravity the einstein term is usually present , recently the case of pure higher derivative theories have been investigated in various contexts @xcite , @xcite and different features of black hole thermodynamics have been explored in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the specific case of @xmath5 theory shows interesting properties .",
    "@xmath5 gravity is ghost free and scale invariant .",
    "the scale invariance holds classically and it is expected that at quantum level the einstein - hilbert term is induced by broking the symmetry in a soft manner @xcite .",
    "the theory is conformally equivalent to general relativity plus cosmological constant with minimally coupled scalar fields and its particle content depends on the background .",
    "for instance on a flat background the theory only propagates a scalar mode while in a curved background ( de sitter ) , along with the scalar state it propagates a massless graviton .",
    "the later is in agreement with the fact that for @xmath6 the theory is equivalent as we mentioned above to general relativity with cosmological constant plus minimally coupled scalar fields . for @xmath7",
    "this conformal transformation becomes singular.many of these features let the authors of @xcite to revisit the supersymmetric extensions of pure @xmath5 gravity . in its new minimal formulation ,",
    "the multiplet of the @xmath5 supergravity consists on a vierbein and its supersymmetric partner the gravitino , and the off - shell realization of supersymmetry is ensured by introducing two auxiliary fields that turn out to be a gauge field together with a two - form , both possessing the gauge symmetry .",
    "the aim of this letter is to explore the space of solutions of the bosonic sector of this @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "we will first establish that the existence of regular static solutions imposes that a particular linear combination of the scalar curvature together with the norm of the dual field strength associated to the two - form must be a constant @xmath8 . under this restriction",
    ", the original field equations reduce to a second - order , traceless system . for a constant @xmath9 ,",
    "the theory is no longer equivalent to a scalar tensor theory and the einstein field equations are automatically satisfied by imposing a certain relation between the gauge field and the dual field strength . in this case",
    ", we will construct black holes and wormholes . at this particular point ,",
    "pp - waves are also admissible with a null dual field . on the other hand for @xmath10",
    ", we establish the existence of product spaces of the form @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote respectively the three - dimensional hyperbolic and de - sitter spaces .",
    "interestingly enough , the field equations are also shown to support ads - waves or siklos spacetimes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we define the theory , providing the lagrangian as well the field equations . in section iii , we establish that the existence of static regular solutions requires that the following combination @xmath15 must be a constant @xmath8 , where @xmath16 stands for the scalar curvature and @xmath17 denotes the dual field strength .",
    "this latter condition notably simplifies the system for asymptotically flat or ads black holes and wormholes , reducing the field equations to a traceless , second order system .",
    "section iv is devoted to present some interesting solutions with non - vanishing @xmath8 while in section v we construct static black holes and wormholes that correspond to solutions with @xmath9 . in the last section ,",
    "we provide some further comments .",
    "in this section , we present the bosonic sector of the @xmath18terms of the @xmath0 supergravity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the bosonic action is described by the metric and the two auxiliary gauge fields , and is given by @xmath19   = \\int\\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x\\left ( \\frac{1}{8g^{2}}\\left (   r+6h_{\\mu}h^{\\mu}\\right )   ^{2}-\\frac{1}{4g^{2}}f_{\\mu\\nu}\\left (   a_{\\rho}^{-}\\right )   f^{\\mu\\nu}\\left (   a_{\\rho}^{-}\\right ) \\right )   \\ , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 here , the three - form @xmath22 is defined as the field strength of the auxiliary two form @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath23 + cyclic perm .",
    "the local existence of @xmath1 is ensured provided the condition @xmath24 holds .",
    "note that the action is invariant under the rigid scale transformation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an arbitrary non - vanishing constant .",
    "the corresponding field equations coming from the variations of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath27 , @xmath1 and @xmath28 , reduce to the following set of equations @xmath29",
    "\\left (   r+6h_{\\alpha}h^{\\alpha}\\right ) = 2t_{\\mu\\nu}^{m}\\left (   a^{-}\\right )   \\ , \\label{eg}\\]]@xmath30   &   = 0\\ , \\label{eh}\\\\ \\nabla_{\\mu}f^{\\mu\\nu}\\left (   a^{-}\\right )    &   = 0\\ , \\label{ea}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 being the maxwell energy - momentum tensor defined as @xmath32    in the next section we will establish that the existence of regular , static solutions requires the following combination @xmath33 to be a constant .",
    "let us consider the following static ansatz for the metric @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a spacelike metric and @xmath36 depends only on the spacelike coordinates @xmath37 .",
    "this metric may cover the domain of outer communications of a static black hole or even a global metric on a wormhole geometry . in the former case",
    ", the function @xmath38 vanishes at the horizon while for the wormhole solution the function is non - vanishing everywhere . considering the trace of equation ( [ eg ] ) and multiplying the result by @xmath39 one obtains@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the covariant derivative intrinsically defined by @xmath35 . integrating this result on a @xmath42-constant ( spacelike ) hypersurface and disregarding boundary terms one obtains@xmath43 where @xmath8 is a constant . to be able to drop the boundary terms , in the black hole geometry we have to require a certain asymptotic behavior at infinity , while to do so in the case of the wormhole geometry we have to require such asymptotic behavior to be valid at both asymptotic regions .",
    "note that by performing a rigid scale transformation , according to the symmetry ( [ scaleinvariance ] ) , we can normalize the constant @xmath8 to @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "the constraint ( [ constraintc ] ) considerably simplifies the original field equations ( [ eg ] ) and it is clear that the cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 must be treated separately .",
    "indeed , for a non - vanishing @xmath8 , the equations ( [ eg]-[ea ] ) yields a reduced system defined by the following second order equations @xmath46 with the further requirement that @xmath24 .",
    "even though this reduced system is of second order , it is non - trivial to find general solutions for spacetimes with a given symmetry .",
    "nevertheless we have been able to construct some scattered solutions that we report and analyze in the next sections .",
    "on the other hand , if the constant @xmath8 vanishes , besides the gravitational constraint @xmath47 , one has that the theory reduces to maxwell theory for @xmath48 with the further constraint of vanishing energy - momentum tensor , i.e.@xmath49 for the static ansatz ( [ 1mas3 ] ) , this implies that @xmath28 and @xmath50 are equal , up to a total derivative .",
    "we separate the solutions we have found in two families depending on whether @xmath8 in ( [ constraintc ] ) vanishes or not .",
    "we now turn our analysis in looking for solutions of the reduced field equations ( [ egred])-([const])-([max ] ) for which the constant @xmath10 .",
    "since ads - waves as well as products of constant curvature spacetimes have constant scalar invariants , it is natural to explore the possibility for such spacetimes to be solutions of our reduced field equations .",
    "in addition , we assume that the @xmath52 gauge field @xmath28 and the dual field @xmath17 are proportional @xmath53 condition which automatically ensures that the maxwell equations are satisfied , and also allows to decouple the maxwell part from the einstein equations . indeed , in this case the latter reduce @xmath54 and where the divergence - free condition @xmath24 must also hold .    @xmath55 the product spaces",
    "@xmath56:let us consider the product spaces @xmath56 where @xmath13 denotes the three - dimensional hyperbolic space . in this case , a solution is given by @xmath57 this corresponds to a solution of ( [ redeqs ] ) with @xmath58 , and since the equations are local , one could as well consider quotients @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a freely acting , discrete subgroup of @xmath61 .",
    "this identification might have some effect on the possible global existence of killing spinors .",
    "@xmath55 the product spaces @xmath12:as before , we show that the product of the three - dimensional de sitter space with @xmath62 provide a simple solution of the reduced equations with non - vanishing @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , in this case , the solution reads @xmath63 and corresponds to a solution with a positive constant @xmath64 .",
    "note that this solution can be wick rotated yielding a new euclidean solution which reduces locally to @xmath65 .",
    "the fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 remain invariant under the wick rotation .",
    "@xmath68ads - waves : as mentioned before , the ads waves present the advantage that all their scalar invariants are constants making these confirgurations possible interesting candidates for the sector of the theory we are exploring . note that such configurations have been shown to be solutions of einstein gravity with a nonminimal scalar field @xcite as well as for quadratic corrections of the einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "the line element of the ads waves can be parameterized as follows @xmath69 which clearly emphasize that these spacetimes can be obtained from ads through a kerr - schild transformation .",
    "this allows to interpret the ads waves as exact gravitational waves propagating on the ads space , and consequently their matter source must behave as a pure radiation field .",
    "this last condition may be satisfied requiring the dual field @xmath17 to be along the retarded time @xmath70 as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a function depending on all the coordinates except the null one @xmath73 .",
    "note that the divergenceless condition of @xmath17 is automatically satisfied in this case .",
    "the field equations ( [ redeqs ] ) with an ansatz of the form ( [ adswaveans]-[dfu ] ) will be fulfilled provided that the following equation @xmath74 holds . in this case @xmath75 and since @xmath17 is null the constant @xmath76 is non - vanishing .",
    "this means that for any null field of the form ( [ dfu ] ) , one is able in principle to find ads wave configurations provided that the structural function @xmath77 satisfies the equation ( [ eqf ] ) .",
    "for example , in the case with @xmath72 being a constant , this equation may be easily integrated yielding @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath8 and @xmath81 are arbitrary functions of the retarded time @xmath70 .    just to conclude this section",
    ", we would like to mention that pp waves are also solutions of the equations ( [ eqf ] ) with a null dual field , but in this case they correspond to a solution with a vanishing constant @xmath8",
    ".    the solutions we have just mentioned have non - vanishing @xmath8 , and we have presented cases with @xmath8 being positive an negative . in the next section we present solutions with vanishing @xmath8 .",
    "we now look for solutions for which the integration constant @xmath9 , and we first consider the following spherically symmetric ansatz @xmath82 where @xmath83 stands for the line element of the two - sphere . if @xmath84 is non - vanishing , this metric describes a wormhole geometry where the surface @xmath85 represents a traversable wormhole throat .",
    "geodesics with vanishing angular momentum are pulled towards the minimum of the function @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath86 vanishes the metric ( [ metricblackworm ] ) may represent a black hole geometry with an event horizon located at @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "the whole system of equations ( [ eg]-[ea ] ) are solved by @xmath89 provided@xmath90 here @xmath91 and @xmath17 is divergenceless , ensuring the local existence of the auxiliary two - form @xmath1 .",
    "the function @xmath92 is arbitrary , and in this case the constant @xmath8 in equation ( [ constraintc ] ) vanishes .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of ( [ mef ] ) at @xmath93 , reveals that the leading term in @xmath84 behaves as @xmath94 , and therefore the solutions of ( [ mef ] ) will provide us with asymptotically locally ads spacetimes . the general solution of ( [ mef ] )",
    "can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions @xmath95 , and is given by@xmath96",

    "\\right )   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are two integration constants .",
    "since the equation ( [ mef ] ) is a linear , non - homogeneous , ordinary differential equation , one can take the real part of this solution to obtain a function that defines a metric . depending on the values of the integration constants",
    "the solution may describe black hole or wormhole configurations as shown in figure 1 .",
    "these solutions extend the solutions recently found in @xcite to the asymptotically ads case .",
    "vs @xmath99 for different values of the integration constants . ]    the black line in figure 1 , describes a regular black hole , which is asymptotically ads .",
    "the first zero of the function @xmath84 ( from right to left ) defines the event horizon , while the second one defines a cauchy horizon .",
    "the dashed line in figure 1 , describes a wormhole which is asymptotically ads at both asymptotic  regions .",
    "the lapse function has a minimum at a certain point which in general differs from the location of the throat ( located at @xmath85 ) .",
    "as observed for example in @xcite and @xcite , this has an interesting effect on the geodesics with angular momentum since gravity pulls geodesics with vanishing angular momentum towards the minimum of the function @xmath84 while the centrifugal contribution reverses its direction at the throat .",
    "therefore , there is a region between the throat and the minimum of the function @xmath100 on which both contributions on geodesics with angular momentum point in the same direction and therefore the geodesic flow obligates a particle to go out from such region .    as a second example of solutions with @xmath9",
