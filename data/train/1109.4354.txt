    "in this proceeding we report the main results of our recent work on pion photoproduction @xcite . this work has two salient features .",
    "one is that the work is done within a dynamical coupled - channels approach based on the jlich @xmath0 model , which includes the @xmath0 and @xmath6 stable channels as well as the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 effective channels accounting for the resonant part of the @xmath10 channel , and has been quite successful in the description of @xmath1 scattering for center - of - mass energies up to @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "the other is that in addition to satisfying unitarity and analyticity as a matter of course , in this work the full photoproduction amplitude satisfies the full gauge - invariance condition dictated by the generalized ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the vast majority of existing models satisfy only current conservation but not gauge invariance .",
    "the full photoproduction amplitude @xmath11 reads @xcite @xmath12 where the first three terms describe the amplitudes from @xmath13- , @xmath14- and @xmath15-channel interaction diagrams , respectively .",
    "apart from the nucleon exchange , @xmath16 contains eight genuine resonances , namely @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as required by the jlich model for @xmath25 scattering .",
    "@xmath26 includes @xmath27 and @xmath28 exchanges and @xmath29 includes @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 exchanges .",
    "the last term @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmu ] ) is the interaction current , @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the transverse part of @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the non - polar part of the hadronic scattering amplitude taken from jlich @xmath0 model ; @xmath39 describes the free propagation of the intermediate meson - baryon two - body system .",
    "@xmath40 is the generalized contact current accounting for the complicated part of the interaction current which can not be treated explicitly .",
    "it is chosen in such a way that the full photoproduction amplitude @xmath11 satisfies the generalized ward - takahashi identity and thus is gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "we refer the readers to refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "differential cross sections and photon spin asymmetries for @xmath41 .",
    "the solid curves show our results and the scattered symbols are data from ref .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=51.0% ] differential cross sections and photon spin asymmetries for @xmath43 .",
    "the solid curves show our results and the scattered symbols are data from ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=51.0% ]    real part and imaginal part of the multipole amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 with isospin @xmath47 as a function of the @xmath0 center - of - mass energy .",
    "scattered symbols are amplitudes taken from the george - washington university s partial wave analysis @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we have studied both the differential cross sections and the photon spin asymmetries for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath48 up to @xmath0 center - of - mass energy @xmath49 gev . the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pi+n ] , [ fig : pi0p ] and [ fig : pi - p ] .",
    "one sees that the overall agreement with the experimental data is very good . at higher energies",
    "there are some discrepancies .",
    "further studies are needed to understand whether these discrepancies are due to the lack of high - spin resonances or effects from @xmath50 and @xmath51 channels which are not included in the present work .",
    "we have also studied the total cross sections for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath48 reactions and our results are in very good agreement with the data .",
    "the effects from the coupled channels and the generalized contact terms are also investigated , and our results show that they both are very important for getting the data . due to the page limit of this proceeding , we refer the readers to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .    motivated by the good agreement of our results with the data of the total and differential cross sections as well as the photon spin asymmetries ,",
    "we have extracted the multipole amplitudes for pion photoproduction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : multipole ] , the results for the multipole amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 from the present calculation ( solid curves ) are shown together with the results from the said analysis @xcite .",
    "we see that the agreement between the two results for the dominant @xmath44 amplitude is quite good but for the smaller @xmath45 amplitude there is a considerable disagreement .",
    "this illustrates the kind of uncertainties one should expect from the present - type calculations , even though we reproduce the cross sections and beam asymmetries quite nicely .",
    "it is clear that in order to extract more reliable multipoles ( apart from the dominant ones ) from the present model , one needs to include more independent observables to further constrain the model .",
    "actually , the said results are also subject to some assumptions in their analysis , since we do not have a complete set of data up to now . in a recent analysis @xcite",
    ", workman has also investigated the sensitivity of the extracted multipole amplitudes to the accuracy of the data used in their extraction .",
