    "the energy - harvesting ( eh ) channel consists of one source equipped with an energy buffer , and one destination . for simplicity , in this paper , we assume that the buffer has infinite capacity . at each discrete time @xmath3 ,",
    "a random amount of energy @xmath4 arrives at the buffer and the source transmits a symbol @xmath5 such that @xmath6 this implies that the total harvested energy @xmath7 must be no smaller than the energy of the codeword @xmath8 at every discrete time @xmath9 for transmission to take place successfully .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "the destination receives @xmath13 at time slot  @xmath9 for each @xmath14 where @xmath15 are i.i.d .",
    "standard normal random variables .",
    "we refer to the above eh channel as the _ additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) eh channel_. it was shown by ozel and ulukus  @xcite that the capacity of the awgn eh channel is @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] is the expectation of the harvested energy for each energy arrival .",
    "the awgn eh channel models real - world , practical situations where energy may not be fully available at the time of transmission and its unavailability may result in the transmitter not being able to put out the desired codeword .",
    "this model is applicable in large - scale sensor networks where each node is equipped with an eh device that collects a stochastic amount of energy .",
    "see  @xcite for a comprehensive review of recent advances in eh wireless communications .",
    "observe that the capacity in is unchanged vis -  - vis the awgn channel _ without _ the eh constraints .",
    "the capacity is an _",
    "concept , defined as the number of channel uses @xmath2 is allowed to tend to infinity .",
    "the result of ozel and ulukus  @xcite thus masks the higher - order rate - losses that may arise due to the eh constraints .",
    "however , in many real - world applications , delay or latency constraints are present , e.g. , we can not wait infinitely long to decode the transmitted codeword .",
    "this begs the natural question : _ information - theoretically , and from a finite blocklength ( non - asymptotic ) @xcite perspective , what are the rate - losses for various channels when we take the eh constraints into account ? _ this is what this paper investigates both for the awgn eh channel and its discrete memoryless counterpart .",
    "one of the main takeaways from this work is that , compared to when eh constraints are not present ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , there can potentially be a significant backoff from capacity at moderate blocklengths if one uses the save - and - transmit strategy  @xcite to take the eh constraints in account .",
    "the contributions of this paper are threefold :    1 .",
    "first , we prove achievable finite blocklength bounds for eh channels under the constraint in based on the save - and - transmit strategy of  @xcite . during the saving phase of the save - and - transmit strategy",
    ", we save energy for a certain number of time slots . during this period ,",
    "no information is transmitted .",
    "subsequently , during the transmission phase , we use the remaining time slots to send information . by carefully developing various concentration bounds to control the probability that the available energy is insufficient to support the transmitted codeword during the transmission phase ( i.e. , that @xmath18 ) , we show that the backoff from capacity @xmath0 at a blocklength @xmath2 is no larger than @xmath19 . in other words , the maximum number of codewords we can transmit over @xmath2 channel uses with average probability of error no larger than @xmath20 , denoted by @xmath21 , satisfies @xmath22 we also identify the implied constant @xmath23 and provide qualitative interpretations . such an analysis for noisy channels was not available prior to the present work .",
    "furthermore , by scrutinizing the analysis of ozel and ulukus  @xcite for awgn channels , one can also deduce that the backoff from capacity is no larger than @xmath24 .",
    "thus , our analysis results in a slightly smaller ( tighter ) backoff than what was implied by the authors in  @xcite .",
    "2 .   second , our analysis only requires minimal statistical assumptions on the eh process @xmath10 . indeed , apart from assuming that the process is i.i.d .",
    ", we only assume that the second moment of the eh random variable @xmath25 is bounded , i.e. , @xmath26<\\infty,\\qquad \\forall \\ , \\ell\\in\\mathbb{n}.\\ ] ] in previous results such as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas 1 & 2 ) , more restrictive assumptions on @xmath25 were made , e.g. , that @xmath27 $ ] is bounded for some @xmath28 .",
    "this assumption may be hard to verify in practice .",
    "3 .   finally , we study both awgn and discrete memoryless eh channels . previous work on finite blocklength analysis for eh channels was performed by yang  @xcite for _ noiseless binary _ channels .",
    "the analysis required the use of sophisticated martingale convergence theorems and renewal process theory .",
    "our analysis is comparatively simple , making use of basic probability techniques such as markov s and chebyshev s inequalities .",
    "furthermore , we also analyze finite blocklength fundamental limits of _ noisy _ channels .",
    "information - theoretic characterizations of eh communication channels have been investigated recently . as energy arrives randomly to the transmitter",
    ", codewords must satisfy the cumulative stochastic energy constraints .",
    "the impact of the stochastic energy supply on the channel capacity was characterized for an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with an i.i.d .",
    "eh process in  @xcite and with a stationary ergodic eh process in  @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned studies showed that with an unlimited battery , the capacity of the awgn channel with stochastic energy constraints is equal to the capacity of the same channel under an average power constraint , as long as the average power equals the average recharge rate of the battery . using shannon s coding scheme for channels with causal state information at the encoder  @xcite ,",
    "the zero battery case for the same problem was discussed in @xcite .",
    "jog and anatharam  @xcite characterized the capacity of the awgn channel with a finite battery when energy arrivals are deterministic .",
    "dong , farnia and zgr  @xcite provided an approximation to the capacity with bounded guarantee on the approximation gap for i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli energy arrivals . in recent work ,",
    "shaviv , nguyen and zgr  @xcite provided an @xmath2-letter expression for the channel capacity with and without causal and noncausal energy arrival information at the transmitter and/or the receiver .",
    "in addition , shaviv and zgr  @xcite investigated a similar problem with a bernoulli recharge process .",
    "mao and hassibi  @xcite investigated the capacity of an energy - harvesting transmitter with finite battery over a discrete memoryless channel ( dmc ) .",
    "it was shown that the capacity can be described using the verd - han general framework  @xcite .",
    "if the transmitted symbol only depends on the currently available energy , the system reduced to a finite - state channel .",
    "however , it was analytically intractable to explicitly characterize the capacity , and even the lower bound of the capacity can only be evaluated numerically .",
    "a special scenario of the same problem , namely the capacity of noiseless binary channel with binary energy arrivals and unit - capacity battery , was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the channel was shown to be equivalent to an additive geometric - noise timing channel with causal information of the noise available at the transmitter .",
    "achievable strategies were proposed along with upper bounds , which were then improved in @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered a noiseless binary energy harvesting channel with on - off fading .",
    "as mentioned above , finite blocklength analysis for eh channels was only considered previously by yang  @xcite . however , the channel considered therein is noiseless and has binary inputs and binary outputs .",
    "our framework is considerably more general and we consider noisy discrete as well as gaussian channels from a finite blocklength perspective .",
    "the study of finite blocklength fundamental limits in shannon - theoretic problems was undertaken by polyanskiy , poor and verd  @xcite .",
    "such a study is useful as it provides guidelines regarding the required backoff from the asymptotic fundamental limit ( capacity ) when one operates at finite blocklengths . for a survey ,",

    "<S> this paper investigates the information - theoretic limits of energy - harvesting ( eh ) channels in the finite blocklength regime . </S>",
    "<S> the eh process is characterized by a sequence of i.i.d .  </S>",
    "<S> random variables with finite variances . </S>",
    "<S> we use the save - and - transmit strategy proposed by ozel and ulukus ( 2012 ) together with shannon s non - asymptotic achievability bound to obtain lower bounds on the achievable rates for both additive white gaussian noise channels and discrete memoryless channels under eh constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order terms of the lower bounds of the achievable rates are equal to @xmath0 and the second - order ( backoff from capacity ) terms are proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the blocklength and @xmath0 denotes the capacity of the eh channel , which is the same as the capacity without the eh constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the constant of proportionality of the backoff term is found and qualitative interpretations are provided .    </S>",
