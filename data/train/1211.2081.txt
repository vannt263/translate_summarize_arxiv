    "ad hoc networks ( vanets ) have been envisioned to provide increased convenience and efficiency to drivers , with numerous applications ranging from traffic safety , traffic efficiency to entertainment @xcite , especially after the advent of ieee 802.11p and ieee 1609 standards @xcite .",
    "one particular type of service , popular content distribution ( pcd ) , has recently attracted lots of attentions , where multimedia contents are distributed from the roadside units ( rsus ) to the on - board units ( obus ) driving through an area of interest ( aoi ) @xcite .",
    "examples of pcd may include : a local hotel periodically broadcasts multimedia advertisements to the vehicles entering the city on suburban highways ; and a traffic authority delivers real - time traffic information ahead , or disseminates an update version of a local gps map @xcite . in brief , the proposed pcd is a local broadcasting service , in which the users are the vehicles ( referred to as obus ) passing through and the contents are multimedia files with large sizes",
    ".    in traditional cellular networks , downloading services , especially broadcasting services , are accomplished by direct transmissions from the base station to the mobile users . however , this scheme may be infeasible for pcd in vanets , since the existence of stationary infrastructures ( the rsus ) can not be guaranteed , and even with infrastructures , the mobile users ( the obus ) may still fail downloading the entire contents due to high speeds of vehicles , deep fadings of wireless channels , and large sizes of popular contents ( such as emergency videos @xcite ) . inspired by the peer - to - peer ( p2p ) protocols on the internet @xcite , which go beyond client - server protocols by letting a client",
    "also be a server , we introduce similar ideas for pcd in vanets by allowing vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) transmissions .",
    "specifically , for the vehicles fail to download the entire contents directly from the rsus , we propose a cooperative approach for them to construct a p2p network , in which popular content pieces can be efficiently exchanged among the obus .",
    "however , the well established p2p techniques on the internet @xcite should be carefully inspected for pcd in vanets , given that :    1 .   due to deep channel fading and co -",
    "channel interferences , wireless links in vanets , relative to the wired links on the internet , are very unreliable ; 2 .   due to unreliable links and high mobility of vehicles , network topologies of vanets , relative to the static topology of the internet , are ever - changing and highly unpredictable .",
    "hence , the expected p2p protocols for pcd in vanets are no longer the application layer protocols based on reliable transmissions . instead",
    ", cross - layer protocols should be constructed , which jointly consider content requests , peer locations , channel capacities , potential interferences and adaptation to environmental changes .    in literature",
    ", there are many related works emerging recently . in @xcite",
    ", the authors focused on applying ieee 802.11 access points to inject data into vehicular networks , and introduced the connectivity challenges posed by such an environment . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed an opportunistic dissemination scheme , in which the data will be exchanged whenever two vehicles are close enough for data transmission .",
    "however , this approach can not avoid potential collisions in media access control ( mac ) layer and may suffer from severe reduction of data rate . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied the cooperative schemes for downloading services in vanets , in which they proposed spawn , a pull - based , peer - to - peer content downloading protocol that extends bittorrent .",
    "however , the peer and content selection mechanisms have high overhead and are not scalable , especially when most of the vehicles are interested in downloading popular contents . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a cooperative medium access control ( mac ) protocol , vc - mac , for gateway downloading scenarios in vehicular networks .",
    "however , the considered  broadcast throughput \" is not content - aware but purely based on link quality , which may not reflect the network performance correctly .",
    "recently , many researchers resort to network coding @xcite methods for content downloading services in vehicular networks . in @xcite , the authors proposed code torrent , a pull - based content distribution scheme using network coding , in which vehicles transmit passively upon the downloading requests initiated by others .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed a push - based content delivery scheme using packet level network coding for emergency related video streaming . in @xcite , the authors provided an in - depth analysis of implementation issues of network coding in vehicular networks by considering general resource constraints ( e.g. , cpu , disk , memory ) besides bandwidth .",
    "in @xcite , the authors present codecast , a network - coding - based ad hoc multicast protocol for multimedia applications with low - loss , low - latency constraints such as audio / video streaming . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a push - based protocol using symbol level network coding for pcd .",
    "all the schemes using network coding , no matter the pull - based or the push - based , have improved the network performance by simplifying p2p transmissions .",
    "further , for avoiding severe data collisions in wireless scenarios , the mac layer schemes for coordinating p2p transmissions have also been proposed @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address pcd in vanets from a game theory point of view using the coalition formation games .",
    "the coalition formation game , in which the players form coalitions to improve their individual profits @xcite , has recently been used in vehicular networks @xcite , e.g. , for rsus cooperation @xcite in content downloading and for bandwidth sharing in vehicle - to - roadside ( v2r ) communications @xcite .",
    "we propose a coalition formation game model , in which the overall performance of the average delay has been formulated by a utility function that all players aim to maximize .",
    "combining the content requests , peer locations , channel capacities , and potential interferences in a single utility function , we jointly consider the simplification issue and the coordination issue for p2p transmissions . with an algorithm that converges to a nash - stable equilibrium proposed , we present our entire approach for pcd in vanets . from the simulation results ,",
    "we show our proposed approach achieves a considerable performance improvement relative to the non - cooperative approach , in which the obus broadcast randomly selected pieces to their neighbors as along as the spectrum is detected to be unoccupied .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section provides the system model . in section , we model pcd in vanets as a coalition formation game with transferable utilities by defining a utility function that reflects the network performance in the average delay . in section , with some mathematical concepts introduced , we propose a coalition formation algorithm for the game , and then give the proposed approach for the entire problem . in section ,",
    "simulation results in various conditions are presented .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section .",
    "consider a vehicular ad hoc network consisting of @xmath0 rsu and @xmath1 obus , where the obus ( the set of which is denoted by @xmath2 ) are passing the rsu along a straight 2-lane highway , as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] . for any obu",
    ", the entire process of pcd can be divided into two phases : the v2r phase and the v2v phase . in the v2r phase ,",
    "the obu is in the coverage of v2r transmissions , and keeps receiving popular pieces that are periodically broadcasted by the rsu .",
    "we assume the entire popular file is beyond the ability of v2r transmission in the v2r phase , which implies that any obu can only obtain a fraction of the popular file after passing the rsu . in the v2v phase , the obus exchange the content pieces by broadcasting to and receiving from the others . in our scenario , no centralized channel coordinator exits and all obus",
    "compete for the same broadcasting channel , which is also used by the rsu for broadcasting in the v2r phase .",
    "the evolution of the popular file in each obu is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] .",
    "although the system model is quite simple , our proposed approach is independent from the traffic model and channel model , and thus , can be extended to more complicated scenarios .",
    "we will discuss the mobility model , channel model and content distribution model in the following subsections .",
    "the mobility model we use is similar to the freeway mobility model ( fmm ) proposed in @xcite , which is well accepted for modeling the traffic in highway scenarios . in ffm ,",
    "the simulation area includes many multiple lane freeways without intersections . at the beginning of the simulation , the vehicles are randomly placed in the lanes , and move at the history - based speeds .",
    "the vehicles randomly accelerate or decelerate with security distance @xmath3 maintained between two subsequent vehicles in the same lane , and no change of lanes is allowed .    in our scenario ,",
    "the map has been simplified to a straight 2-lane highway as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] .",
    "all the obus independently choose to speed up or slow down by probability @xmath4 and acceleration @xmath5 .",
    "the velocity of any obu @xmath6 is limited by @xmath7 for all time . to better reflect the changing topology of vanets",
    ", we decide to allow the change of lanes when a vehicle is overtaking , as long as the security distance is maintained . also , to reflect the car following issue , we give an upper bound @xmath8 for the distance between any two subsequent vehicles in the same lane . as our proposed model is for simplifying and coordinating p2p transmissions , the simulation begins at the v2v phase .",
    "the overall constraints are listed as follows :    1 .",
    "the obus are randomly placed on both lanes in an area with length @xmath9 and just leave the coverage of the rsu when the simulation begins .",
    "the initial speed of obu @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath11 , is randomly given in @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the speed of obu @xmath10 satisfies : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability of acceleration and deceleration .",

    "these channels not only differ from each other , but also deviate significantly from those in cellular communication @xcite . in the v2r phase ,",
    "the antenna of the rsu is high enough that a line of sight ( los ) exits for any obu @xmath6 in the coverage .",
    "we assume that the data rate of v2r transmission for any obu @xmath6 is constantly @xmath26 . in the v2v phase , the obus exchange data through v2v channels , which are highly affected by severe shadowing @xcite .",
    "we assume the v2v link exists only between vehicles with a los , or equivalently between  neighbors \" .",
    "all vehicles are equipped with a single antenna and the v2v transmission is divided into periodical slots with size @xmath27 . in each slot , we adopt the rician model for small - scale fading with the propagation loss factor @xmath28 . the channel capacity between any two obus @xmath29 at slot @xmath30 , is then given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance between obu @xmath17 and obu @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the signal - to - noise rate ( snr ) at transmitters , @xmath35 is the channel bandwidth , and @xmath36 is the rician channel gain given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a random variable uniformly distributed in @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 is a complex gaussian random variable with unit variance and zero mean , and @xmath41 is the ratio of the energy in the los path to the energy in the scattered paths .",

    "by focusing on the v2v phase , we consider the p2p transmissions in a given slot @xmath30 .",

    "thus , the total possessed packets may not converge to @xmath0 even after arbitrarily long time .    in fig .",
    "[ transmitter ] , we show the number of total transmitters as a function of time by both the proposed approach and the non - cooperative approach for networks with @xmath163 and @xmath164 . as the vehicles deviate from each other and split into disconnected groups with time , the proposed approach will limit the inefficient broadcastings of obus on the edge . however , in the non - cooperative approach , the broadcasting vehicles may even increase with time as the spectrum becomes less crowed when they vehicles split into groups .",
    "thus , the transmitters in the proposed approach decreases with time , while the transmitters in the non - cooperative approach increases .    in fig .",
    "[ average_delay ] , we show the average delay as a function of the number of obus @xmath1 by both the proposed approach and the non - cooperative approach for networks with @xmath166 and @xmath164 .",
    "we can see that the average delay decreases as the number of obus increases , and our proposed algorithm achieves much better performances than the non - cooperative approach .",
    "with more obus included in the network , the packets can be transmitted or received by more vehicles , and the performance in average delay is thus improved .",
    "further , the increasing number of obu also lowers the probability of splitting , which decreases the average delay in another way .",
    "as the proposed approach aims at minimizing the average delay formulated in the utility function given by ( [ utilitys ] ) , the proposed approach again has a better performance .    in fig .",
    "[ average_delay2 ] , we show the average delay as a function of the diameter of the rsu coverage @xmath49 by the proposed approach and the non - cooperative approach for networks with @xmath167 , and @xmath168 . as the diameter of the rsu @xmath49 is enlarged , or equivalently the v2r transmission time is increased , the initial possessed packets are increased for each obu in the v2v phase , which directly reduces the time for p2p transmissions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ average_delay2 ] .",
    "when the coverage of the rsu is extremely large , or equivalently the v2r transmission time is quite sufficient , the obus may achieve the entire popular file in the v2r phase , which explains why both the two curves converge to @xmath169 when @xmath49 surpasses a certain threshold .",
    "in this situation , the pcd problem degenerates into pure broadcasting services .    in fig .",
    "[ convergence ] , we show the number of switch operations in the proposed scheme as a function of time for networks with @xmath170 .",
    "the complexity of our proposed algorithm is mainly caused by the switch operations , the number of which decreases rapidly in the first few slots and then stays at a very low level , as shown in fig .",
    "[ convergence ] .",
    "the small number of switch operations implies that the proposed approach can adapt to the environmental changes only with limited complexity .",
    "also , we find that the stable complexity , represented by the average number of switch operations in table slots , increases linearly with the number of obus @xmath1 , which may imply that the network scale can be much larger in practical systems .",
    "in this paper , we address the pcd problem in vehicular ad hoc networks , where the obus may not finish downloading a large file directly from the rsu when they are moving at high speeds . for completing the file delivery process ,",
    "a p2p network is constructed in the v2v phase of pcd , for which we propose a cooperative approach based on the coalition formation games . in the proposed approach ,",
    "we formulate the performance of the average delay into a utility function , which highly decides the individual profits for each obu in the proposed coalition formation game . with the proposed coalition formation algorithm ,",
    "the obus dynamically converge to a nash - stable partition , and the most efficient coalition in the final partition is allowed to broadcast in the current slot . in the simulation part , we further propose a non - cooperative approach in which the obus broadcast as long as the spectrum is unoccupied .",
    "we show that the proposed protocol achieves much better performances in the average delay and power efficiency , compared with the non - cooperative approach .",
