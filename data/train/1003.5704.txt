    "many dynamical phenomena in biology involve some form of _ synchronization_. synchronization has attracted much research both from the theoretical , see e.g. @xcite,@xcite , @xcite to cite just a few , and experimental @xcite , @xcite viewpoints .",
    "the particular case of synchronized _ time - periodic _ processes , where time - scales can range from a few milliseconds to several years @xcite , includes e.g. circadian rhythms in mammals @xcite , the cell cycle @xcite , spiking neurons @xcite and respiratory oscillations @xcite .",
    "when modelling such networks , it is often assumed that each node communicates directly with other nodes in the network , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . in many natural instances , however , network nodes do not communicate directly , but rather by means of noisy and continuously changing environments",
    ". bacteria , for instance , produce , release and sense signaling molecules ( so - called autoinducers ) which can diffuse in the environment and are used for population coordination .",
    "this mechanism , known as _ quorum sensing _",
    "@xcite is believed to play a key role in bacterial infection , as well as e.g. in bioluminescence and biofilm formation @xcite , @xcite . in a neuronal context ,",
    "a mechanism similar to that of quorum sensing may involve _ local field potentials _ , which may play an important role in the synchronization of clusters of neurons , @xcite .    from a network dynamics viewpoint ,",
    "the key characteristic of quorum sensing - like mechanisms lies in the fact that communication between nodes ( e.g. bacteria ) occurs by means of a shared quantity ( e.g. autoinducer concentration ) .",
    "furthermore , the production and degradation rates of such a quantity are affected by all the nodes of the network .",
    "therefore , a detailed model of such a mechanism needs to keep track of the temporal evolution of the shared quantity , resulting in an additional set of ordinary differential equations .    mathematical work on such quorum sensing",
    "topologies is relatively sparse ( e.g. , @xcite ) compared to that on diffusive topologies , and often neglects quorum variable dynamics or the dynamics of the environment .",
    "this sparsity of results is somewhat surprising given that , besides its biological pervasiveness , quorum sensing may also be viewed as an astute `` computational '' tool .",
    "specifically , use of a shared variable in effect significantly reduces the number of links required to achieve a given connectivity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we derive sufficient conditions for the coordination of nodes communicating through dynamical quorum sensing mechanisms .",
    "these results can be used both to analyse natural networks , and to guide design of communication mechanisms in synthetic or partially synthetic networks .",
    "we first consider , in section [ sec : basic_model ] , the case where the network nodes ( e.g. , the biological entities populating the environment ) are all identical or nearly identical .",
    "we then focus , in section [ sec : basic_model_multiple ] , on networks composed of heterogeneous nodes , i.e. , nodes of possibly diverse dynamics . in this case",
    "we provide sufficient conditions ensuring that all the network nodes sharing the same dynamics converge to a common behavior , a particular instance of so - called concurrent synchronization @xcite . in section  [ sec",
    ": cluster ] , the results are further extended to a distributed version of quorum sensing , where multiple groups of possibly heterogeneous nodes communicate by means of multiple media .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : synchro_control ] , we propose a strategy for controlling the common asymptotic evolution of the network nodes",
    ". section  [ n ] studies the dependence of synchronization properties on the number of nodes , a question of interest e.g. in the context of cell proliferation .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] illustrates the general approach with a set of examples .",
    "our proofs are based on nonlinear contraction theory ( @xcite ) , a viewpoint on incremental stability which we briefly review in section  [ sec : math_tools ] , and which has emerged as a powerful tool in applications ranging from lagrangian mechanics to network control .",
    "historically , ideas closely related to contraction can be traced back to  @xcite and even to  @xcite ( see also  @xcite , and e.g.  @xcite for a more exhaustive list of related references ) .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , contraction is preserved through a large variety of systems combinations , and in particular it represents a natural tool for the study and design of nonlinear state observers , and by extension , of synchronization mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the basic result of nonlinear contraction analysis @xcite which we shall use in this paper can be stated as follows .",
    "[ theorem : contraction ] consider the @xmath0-dimensional deterministic system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a smooth nonlinear function .",
    "the system is said to be _ contracting _ if any two trajectories , starting from different initial conditions , converge exponentially to each other .",
    "a sufficient condition for a system to be contracting is that there exists a constant invertible matrix @xmath3 such that the so - called generalized jacobian @xmath4 verifies @xmath5 where @xmath6 is one the the standard matrix measures in table 1 .",
    "the scalar @xmath7 defines the contraction rate of the system .    for convenience ,",
    "in this paper we will also say that a _ function _",
    "@xmath8 is contracting if the system @xmath9 satisfies the sufficient condition above .",
    "similarly , we will then say that the corresponding jacobian _ matrix _",
    "@xmath10 is contracting .",
    "[ tab : matrix_measures ]    .standard matrix measures [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now , contraction of the above system is guaranteed if    1 .",
    "@xmath11 is uniformly negative definite ; 2 .",
    "@xmath12 is uniformly negative definite .",
    "recall that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are both scalars .",
    "now , the second condition is satisfied since system parameters are all positive .",
    "that is , to prove contraction we have only to guarantee that @xmath15 is uniformly negative . since @xmath16 contraction is ensured if the biochemical parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 fulfill the following condition @xmath20",
    "in this paper , we presented a systematic methodology to derive conditions for the global exponential convergence of biochemical models modeling quorum sensing systems . to illustrate the effectiveness of our results and to emphasize the use of our techniques in synthetic biology design",
    ", we analyzed a set of biochemical networks where the quorum sensing mechanism is involved as well as a typical pathway of the quorum sensing . in all such cases we showed that our results can be used to determine system parameters and dynamics ensuring convergence .",
    "to prove theorem [ thm : network_convergence_multiple_nodes ] we need the following lemma , which is a generalization of a result proven in @xcite :    [ lem : partition ] consider the block- partition for a square matrix @xmath21 : @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are square matrices of dimensions @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath23 and @xmath27 are contracting with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( induced by the vector norm @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "then , @xmath21 is contracting if there exists two positive real numbers @xmath32 , @xmath33 such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the operator norms induced by @xmath30 and @xmath31 on the linear operators @xmath37 and @xmath27 . furthermore , the contraction rate is @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "we will show that , with the above hypotheses , @xmath21 is contracting with respect to the matrix measure induced by the following vector norm : @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in this norm",
    ", we have @xmath42 thus , @xmath43 pick now @xmath44 and a unit vector @xmath45 ( depending on @xmath46 ) such that @xmath47 .",
    "we have , dropping the subscripts for the norms : @xmath48 since @xmath49 , we finally have @xmath50 taking now the limit for @xmath51 : @xmath52 thus proving the result .    following the same arguments , lemma [ lem : partition ]",
    "can be straightforwardly extended to the case of a real matrix @xmath21 partitioned as @xmath53\\ ] ] where the diagonal blocks of @xmath21 are all square matrices .",
    "then @xmath21 is contracting if @xmath54 ( where subscripts for matrix measures and norms have been neglected ) .      the assumption of input equivalence for the nodes implies the existence of a linear invariant subspace associated to the concurrent synchronization steady state regime .",
    "we will prove convergence towards such a subspace , by proving that the network dynamics is contracting .",
    "let @xmath55 be the matrix measure where the nodes dynamics is contracting and define : @xmath56 , @xmath57 as the stack of all intrinsic nodes dynamics , @xmath58 the stack of nodes coupling functions .",
    "we want to prove that there exist a matrix measure , @xmath6 , ( which is in general different from @xmath55 ) where the whole network dynamics is contracting .",
    "denote with @xmath59 the laplacian matrix @xcite of the network and define the matrix @xmath60 , whose @xmath61-th block , @xmath62 , is defined as follows : @xmath63 ( notice that if all the nodes are identical and have the same dynamics and the same coupling functions , then @xmath64 can be written in terms of the kronecker product , @xmath65 , as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 denoting the dimension of the nodes and @xmath68 the @xmath69 identity matrix . )    the jacobian of ( [ eqn : net_multiple_dynamics ] ) is then : @xmath70\\ ] ] the system is contracting if @xmath71 is uniformly negative definite . now : @xmath72 notice that , by hypotheses , the matrix @xmath73 has negative diagonal blocks and zero column sum .",
    "thus , using ( [ eqn : lemma_useful ] ) with @xmath74 for all @xmath75 , @xmath76 yields @xmath77 thus : @xmath78 since the matrix @xmath79 is block diagonal , i.e. all of its off - diagonal elements are zero , ( [ eqn : lemma_useful ] ) yields : @xmath80 the theorem is then proved by noticing that by hypothesis the right hand side of the above expression is uniformly negative .",
