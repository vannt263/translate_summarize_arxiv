    "in statistical mechanics , a fundamental object of interest is the partition function , the sum over the space of configurations @xmath0 of the boltzmann weight @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy of a configuration : @xmath3    if the lattice is two - dimensional , the standard test for integrability is the existence of a commuting family of transfer matrices . for a system with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the partition function can be written as the trace of the product of transfer matrices .",
    "these are operators on the hilbert space of a one - dimensional slice of the lattice , which depend on a spectral parameter .",
    "the coefficients in expansion of this operator as a series in the spectral parameter gives commuting integrals of the motion , hence integrability .",
    "the hamiltonian associated with the one - dimensional system is one of those integrals .",
    "for example , the six - vertex model transfer matrix is associated with the @xmath4 heisenberg spin chain hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional integrable lattice model may undergo a second - order phase transition at certain critical points , in the infinite - lattice limit . at the critical point ,",
    "the behavior of the model may be described by an effective conformal field theory .",
    "the correspondence includes the identification of the critical exponents , given by the conformal dimensions , and the specific heat , given by the central charge of the family of virasoro representations which make up the hilbert space of the quantum field theory .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the massless part of the spectrum  that is , order 1 excitations in the statistical model , and quasi - particles in the quantum field theory  are also related , and an identification can be made via the partition functions .",
    "for the lattice model the spectrum is computed from the bethe ansatz .",
    "the `` order one '' , or massless , excitations , which contribute to the conformal partition function , have a `` quasi - particle - like '' behavior . for small momenta ,",
    "their energy is a linear function of the momentum .",
    "we call this the linearized spectrum .    in conformal field theory ,",
    "the chiral part of the partition function is given by the specialized characters of certain ( not necessarily irreducible ) virasoro modules .",
    "the full partition function is a modular invariant sesquilinear combination of these and includes both the chiral and anti - chiral parts .    in the original work of the author and collaborators",
    "@xcite , it was shown that , starting from the bethe ansatz , linearizing the spectrum and considering only massless excitations above the vacuum , the resulting partition function is equal to the chiral part of the partition function in the conformal field theory , given by virasoro characters .",
    "the spectrum obtained from the bethe ansatz is invariably of fermionic nature . at the time when this work was done , few fermionic constructions of virasoro modules were known .",
    "for example , the feigin - fuks construction of the most interesting virasoro modules involves a resolution of the verma module using the singular vectors , and is thus given by an inclusion - exclusion principle , or ( in general ) an infinite alternating sum .",
    "a fermionic construction is a basis of the representation given by the action of skew - commuting operators on the vacuum .",
    "this gives rise to fermionic statistics : identical fermions can not occupy the same point in phase space .",
    "one type of generalization of fermionic statistics will be given below .",
    "these rules are combinatorial and this is reflected in the expression for the partition function .",
    "there are various ways of constructing bases for any given virasoro module .",
    "the idea of fermionic constructions is that physically meaningful ones reflect the spectrum away from criticality of the integrable quantum field theory .",
    "the particle content is some reflection of the form of the primary fields of the conformal field theory .",
    "these fields are the generalized fermions .",
    "see @xcite for a recent example of this .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will give a few examples of fermionic partition functions related to wzw models .",
    "in section 3 , we will relate the general fermionic formulas for graded dimensions of the space of conformal blocks to cluster algebras and quantum cluster algebras . in section 4",
    ", we will show how the integrability of the resulting discrete difference equations ( q - systems and their quantized version ) can be used to give difference equations satisfied by generating functions for the graded dimensions of the space of conformal blocks .",
    "these are variants of quantum difference toda equations .",
    "these dimensions are the dimensions of the moduli space of holomorphic vector bundles on the sphere with prescribed punctures , and their graded analogs .",
    "the author would like to express her gratitude to her advisor b.m .",
    "mccoy , with whom the original formulation of the physical interpretation of conformal partition functions and their fermionic expressions was made ; to m. jimbo , t. miwa for their patient mentorship over many years ; to them as well as b. feigin and e. ardonne , with whom she first worked on fusion products ; and most especially to p. di francesco for an ongoing illuminating collaboration .",
    "the author thanks s. fomin , h. nakajima , n. reshetikhin for their kindness and for helpful discussions related to this work over the years .",
    "this work has been supported by the national science foundation through several grants , most recently nsf dms grant 1100929 .",
    "let us be specific about what we mean by a generalized fermion and the resulting fermionic formula for the partition function .",
    "this phenomenon occurs in finite or infinite systems .",
    "the natural finite - dimensional system to start from is a solvable model on the finite lattice with a spectrum governed by the statistics of the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with a bethe ansatz solution are in bijection with solutions of a coupled set of algebraic equations .",
    "the solutions are specified by a set of integers chosen distinctly on certain finite intervals .",
    "we interpret a choice of one integer as a quasi - particle , and a choice of @xmath5 integers as @xmath5 quasi - particles .",
    "the corresponding choice of integers is proportional to their momentum , one of the conserved quantities .",
    "the fact that the integers should be distinct is what gives them a fermionic nature .",
    "the resulting combinatorics is as follows .",
    "we approximate the energy of each quasi - particle as a linear function of the momentum ( they are massless ) and hence the bethe integers .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in the conformal , infinite - size limit .",
    "suppose the hilbert space with @xmath5 quasi - particles has @xmath5 integers chosen distinctly from the set @xmath6 $ ] for some integer @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the proportionality constant between the energy and the bethe integers",
    ". then the partition function of @xmath5 quasi - particles is @xmath10}_q\\ ] ] where the @xmath11-binomial coefficient is defined as @xmath12_q = \\prod_{j=1}^m\\frac{(1-q^{p+j})}{(1-q^j ) } , \\quad p\\geq m,\\ ] ] and is defined to be zero if @xmath13 .",
    "the partition function of fermions on the interval @xmath6 $ ] is @xmath14}_q.\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath15 , this formula becomes @xmath16 the important characteristics to note are    1 .",
    "there is a quadratic function of the particle number @xmath5 in the exponent .",
    "this is the `` ground state energy '' of a fermionic system with @xmath5 particles .",
    "2 .   there is a @xmath11-binomial coefficient , or its @xmath17 limit , which is just the weighted sum over configurations above the ground state of @xmath5 fermions .",
    "a slight generalization of fermionic statistics always occurs in the bethe ansatz solution : the integer @xmath18 is a linear function of @xmath5 itself , in addition to the external parameters of the system ( such as size ) .",
    "moreover , there is in general more than one `` color '' of quasi - particle , and these have available energy ranges for each color separately .",
    "again , these are free fermions , except for the generalized statistic which hides in the integers @xmath19 for each color : each @xmath19 is a function of the number @xmath20 of quasi - particles of type @xmath21 in the system .",
    "thus a fermionic formula for the ( conformal , linearized version of the ) partition on the finite lattice might has the form @xmath22_q.\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 for some @xmath24 , the ground state energy @xmath25 is a quadratic function of the particle content @xmath26 which depends on the model , as are @xmath19 , which are in general linear functions of @xmath26 , and may tend to infinity as the size of the system becomes infinite . here , the superscript @xmath27 on the summation indicates possible restrictions on the summation variables corresponding to symmetry sectors of the hamiltonian .",
    "a finite system will have only a finite number of terms in the summation",
    ". moreover there may be several different symmetry sectors of the hamiltonian , in which case the partition function can be projected to the different sectors separately .",
    "if the model has a conformal limit ( the size of the system is infinite while the spectrum remains linearized , that is , the system remains critical ) , the partition function ",
    "properly normalized and restricted  tends in the limit to the graded character of some virasoro module .",
    "that is , @xmath28 is proportional to the trace of @xmath29 over the module , where @xmath30 is the grading element of the virasoro algebra .",
    "a conformal field theory is built out of such modules .",
    "this gives a direct connection between the spectrum of the lattice model and the conformal field theory in certain cases .",
    ".2 in      it is well known that the basic representation of the affine algebra @xmath31 can be realized as a quotient of the fock space of free fermions by a heisenberg algebra @xcite .",
    "it is possible to give a finite - dimensional version of this construction @xcite .",
    "as it is closely connected to the graded tensor product construction introduced below in section [ sec - fusion ] , we briefly summarize it .",
    "this finite - dimensional fermionic space gives  in the inductive limit  the frenkel kac construction of the level-1 modules .",
    "let @xmath32 be the defining representation of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 $ ] a representation on which @xmath35\\subset \\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_n$ ] acts as @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 $ ] , and @xmath39 .",
    "consider the @xmath40-fold tensor product @xmath41\\ ] ] on which @xmath42 acts by the usual co - product : @xmath43 where @xmath44 indicates @xmath45 acting on the @xmath46th factor in the tensor product .",
    "obviously , this action commutes with the diagonal action of the symmetric group @xmath47 , simultaneously permuting factors in the tensor product and variables @xmath48 .",
    "it also commutes with the action of the negative part of the heisenberg algebra @xmath49 , acting on the space by multiplication by symmetric polynomials in @xmath50 .",
    "( operators of the form @xmath51 ) .",
    "thus , we have three commuting actions",
    ". we quotient by the action of the heisenberg , and project onto the alternating representation of @xmath47 , and the result is called the reduced wedge space .",
    "it is a finite dimensional space described explicitly as follows .",
    "the quotient by the heisenberg action is the quotient of @xmath52 $ ] by symmetric polynomials of positive degree @xmath53 .",
    "that is , @xmath54/{\\rm i m } \\mathcal h^- =   v^{\\otimes n}\\otimes \\mathbb c[z_1, ... ,z_n]/i_n : = v^{\\otimes n}\\otimes r_n\\ ] ]    the space @xmath55 is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the flag variety and to the regular representation of @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , it is finite - dimensional .",
    "it is a graded by the homogeneous degree in @xmath48 and the action of the symmetric group preserves the graded components .",
    "thus , @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the irreducible representations of @xmath47 and @xmath58 is a graded multiplicity space .",
    "we also have the decomposition @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the partition @xmath61 stripped of its columns of length @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are irreducible finite - dimensional representations of @xmath64 .    taking the tensor product with @xmath55 and projecting onto the alternating representation with respect to the diagonal action of @xmath47 , we identify @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the reduced wedge space is isomorphic to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the transpose of @xmath68 .",
    "the hilbert polynomial of @xmath69 is a kostka polynomial . in the limit as @xmath70 ,",
    "the properly normalized coefficient of @xmath63 is a character of the @xmath71-algebra , which is the centralizer of @xmath64 acting on the level-1 module of @xmath72 , and the character of @xmath73 tends to the character of the basic representation of the affine algebra .",
    "thus the reduced wedge product is a truncation of this space , a demazure module",
    ".    we will give fermionic formulas for the generalizations of this kostka polynomial below .",
    "we now give a very general setting which gives rise to fermionic partition functions .",
    "the wedge space in the previous section is a special case of this construction .",
    "the fermionic formula of the type appears in particular in the generalized heisenberg spin chain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is a quantum spin chain , whose hamiltonian is derived via the @xmath74-matrix which intertwines tensor products of yangian modules @xmath75 .",
    "the simplest case of this is known as the xxx spin chain , which was the subject of bethe s original ansatz @xcite .    to define this spin chain ,",
    "choose a the following data :    1 .",
    "any finite - dimensional yangian module @xmath76 .",
    "this is known as the auxiliary space .",
    "2 .   a sequence of @xmath40 yangian modules @xmath77 of kr - type ( see below ) .",
    "the choice of non - isomorphic representations @xmath78 is the anisotropy of the model .",
    "let @xmath79 be the intertwiner of finite - dimensional representations , known as ( a rational ) @xmath74-matrix .",
    "for generic spectral parameters , the tensor product is irreducicble and @xmath74 is unique , up to scalar multiple .",
    "the transfer matrix of the generalized anisotropic heisenberg model with periodic boundary conditions is the trace over @xmath76 of the matrix @xmath80 .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath81 is an operator on the space @xmath82 , which is the hilbert space of the spin chain , also known as the quantum space .",
    "since the @xmath74-matrix satisfies the yang - baxter equation , it follows easily that the transfer matrices corresponding to different auxiliary spaces commute . expanding the transfer matrix as a series in in the spectral parameter of @xmath76 , each of the coefficients in the expansion ",
    "an element in an algebra acting on the hilbert space",
    " commutes with the other coefficients .",
    "these coefficients therefore form a family of commuting integrals of motion .",
    "the spin chain is a quantum integrable system .",
    "the quantum spin chain hamiltonian is one of the integrals .",
    "this model has a bethe ansatz solution , at least when the modules @xmath83 are of kirillov - reshetikhin ( kr)-type @xcite @xcite .",
    "such modules are parameterized by a highest weight with respect to the cartan subalgebra of @xmath84 and a spectral parameter .",
    "the highest weight of a kr - module is a multiple of one of the fundamental weights of @xmath64 .",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are given by solutions of the bethe equations .",
    "solutions are parameterized in terms of sets of distinct integers in the same manner described above .",
    "the linearized spectrum is proportional to the sum of these integers .    for this particular model",
    ", there is an arbitrary number of quasi - particle species or `` colors '' for each root of the lie algebra @xmath64 , which obey generalized fermionic statistics .",
    "the statistics depends only on the cartan matrix and the highest weights of @xmath83 .",
    "we will write down this function explicitly , as it is key to the rest of the paper ( we restrict our attention here to simply - laced @xmath64 here for simplicity ; the other cases are explained in @xcite ) .",
    "the hilbert space of the model is @xmath85 , so its dimension is @xmath86 .",
    "( the ordering of these representations does not effect the spectrum . )",
    "the partition function of the linearized spectrum gives a graded version of this dimension , and we will provide a representation theoretical interpretation of this grading .",
    "let @xmath87 be the highest weights of @xmath88 respectively .",
    "each @xmath89 is a multiple of one of the fundamental weights , and therefore the choice of highest weights is parameterized by a multi - partition @xmath90 where the non - negative integers @xmath91 are defined by @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the rank of the algebra .",

    "that is , when evaluated at @xmath108 , equation gives an expression for the dimension of the space of @xmath64-linear homomorphisms from the tensor product of kr - modules to the irreducible representation @xmath63 .",

    "it was later proven in @xcite and shown to be closely tied with the laurent property @xcite of the quantum cluster algebra @xcite associated with the @xmath113-system , defined below .",
    "the sum is a generating function for certain betti numbers of quiver varieties in special cases @xcite , see also more recent work giving a geometric context @xcite .",
    "the formula for the linearized partition function of the heisenberg spin chain is of interest for several reasons .",
    "first , it is known that , in special stabilized infinite limits , its conformal limit is the wess - zumino - witten model at a level which depends on the representations @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 , set @xmath116 for all @xmath117 , and consider the limit as the number of representations , @xmath118 becomes infinite .",
    "then the limit @xmath119 of the normalized partition function @xmath120 is the character of the level-@xmath24 module of the affine lie algebra @xmath121 with highest weight @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "then in the limit @xmath70 the normalized , linearized partition function is a kostka polynomial @xcite . in the conformal limit , this gives a character of the @xmath125-algebra which centralizes the action of @xmath64 when acting on the level-1 modules .",
    "another important role of the linearized partition function of the heisenberg model is that it gives the dimension ( at @xmath108 ) of the space of conformal blocks of wzw theory ( when @xmath126 is an integer ) .",
    "this is the dimension of the moduli space of holomorphic vector bundles on a riemann surface with @xmath40 punctures , with specified monodromy given by the representations @xmath114 , which are taken to be arbitrary @xmath72-modules induced from kr - modules , localized at distinct points .",
    "it is also known as the space of coinvariants .",
    "the reason we take @xmath24 to be integer is that the integrality property of the representations is used in the proof of the statement .",
    "the reason we require @xmath126 is that for finite @xmath24 , one has the verlinde coefficients rather than the littlewood richardson coefficients for multiplicities of the irreducibles in the tensor product of integrable modules affine algebra modules .",
    "we did not take this into account in .",
    "a separate conjecture for the fermionic formula of the linearized partition function of this space can be found in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath24 is sufficiently large , the multiplicity is just as a sum of products of littlewood richardson coefficients or their generalization .",
    "we have a graded version of the dimension of the moduli space , meaning we keep track of a certain grading or a refinement of the space .",
    "it is known that , in special cases , this corresponds to keeping track of the betti numbers for a certain quiver variety , giving a geometric meaning to the graded dimensions .",
    "it is known that the hilbert space of the heisenberg model , together with the linearized spectrum of the hamiltonian , in the limit when the number of representations @xmath114 becomes infinite ( taking all @xmath127 , the defining representation , for example ) , gives the characters of affine algebras in the limit as the ( chiral ) conformal partition function .",
    "the relevant conformal field theory is the wzw model at level 1 .",
    "there is also an explicit construction of this infinite - dimensional hilbert space for the xxz model , using the quantum affine algebra , using a stabilized semi - infinite tensor product @xcite . in this case",
    "it is possible to construct the transfer matrix in terms of intertwining operators which gives a direct connection with the deformed primary fields of the conformal field theory .",
    "moreover , we identify the _ dimension _ of the hilbert space of the finite , inhomogeneous heisenberg model with dimension of the space of conformal blocks ( for level @xmath24 sufficiently large ) .",
    "these two facts form the motivation for the following definition of a graded tensor product @xcite .",
    "whereas there are other definitions of an `` energy function '' on the tensor product which defines a grading on the tensor product in the case of quantum affine algebras ( these correspond to the xxz model , or the limit @xmath128 in the case of the crystal basis ) , the definition here refers only to the undeformed current algebra .",
    "kr - modules are defined for three algebras : for the quantum affine algebra @xmath129 , the yangian @xmath130 , and the current algebra @xmath72 .",
    "one of the consequences of the theorems of @xcite is that these all have the same structure under restriction to the underlying finite dimensional algebra , @xmath64 or @xmath131 @xcite .",
