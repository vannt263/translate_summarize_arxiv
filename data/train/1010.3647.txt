    "our understanding of baryon resonances is undergoing continuous change . from the classical picture of the baryons made out of three constituent quarks , passing through attempts to represent some of them in terms of pentaquarks , to the more recent description of some of them in terms of meson baryon molecules . in this sense",
    ", the low lying @xmath9 resonances , @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 , can be represented as dynamically generated states from the meson baryon interaction and are relatively well understood within the unitary chiral models @xcite .",
    "the low lying @xmath4 domain remains far less understood , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "for instance , quark models seem to face difficulties in reproducing properties of the resonances in this sector @xcite .",
    "the neat reproduction of the low lying @xmath13 states in the @xmath3-wave meson - baryon interaction , using chiral dynamics , suggests that the addition of a pseudoscalar meson in s - wave could lead to an important component of the structure of the @xmath14 resonances .",
    "chiral dynamics has been used earlier in the context of the three nucleon problems , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we present in this talk the study done in @xcite of two meson - one baryon systems where chiral dynamics is applied to solve the faddeev equations .",
    "as shall be described below , our calculations for the total @xmath3 = -1 reveal peaks in the @xmath15 system and its coupled channels which we identify with the resonances @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we start by taking all combinations of a pseudoscalar meson of the @xmath22 su(3 ) octet and a baryon of the @xmath14 octet which couple to @xmath23 with any charge . for some quantum numbers ,",
    "the interaction of this two body system is strongly attractive and responsible for the generation of the two @xmath10 states @xcite and other @xmath3 = -1 resonances .",
    "we shall assume that this two body system formed by @xmath24 and coupled channels remains highly correlated when a third particle is added , in the present case a pion .",
    "altogether , we get twenty - two coupled channels for the net charge zero configuration : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 . we assume the correlated pair to have a certain invariant mass , @xmath47 , and the three body @xmath48-matrix is evaluated as a function of this mass and the total energy of the three body system . at the end",
    "we look for the value of @xmath49 as a function of these two variables and find peaks at certain values of these two variables , which indicate the mass of the resonances and how a pair of particles is correlated .",
    "the input required to solve the faddeev equations , i.e. , the two body @xmath50-matrices for the meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions has been calculated by taking the lowest order chiral lagrangian following @xcite and using the dimensional regularization of the loops as done in @xcite , where a good reproduction of scattering amplitudes and resonance properties was found . instead",
    ", a cut off could also be used to regularize the loops as shown in @xcite .",
    "improvements introducing higher order lagrangians have been done recently , including a theoretical error analysis @xcite which allows one to see that the results with the lowest order lagrangian fit perfectly within the theoretical allowed bands .",
    "a shared feature of the recent unitary chiral dynamical calculations is the on - shell factorization of the potential and the @xmath50-matrix in the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite , which is justified by the use of the n / d method and dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can see that the off - shell contributions can be reabsorbed into renormalization of the lower order terms @xcite .",
    "we develop here a similar approach for the faddeev equations .",
    "the full three - body @xmath48-matrix can be written as a sum of the auxiliary @xmath48-matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , are the normal faddeev partitions , which include all the possible interactions contributing to the three - body @xmath48-matrix with the particle @xmath59 being a spectator in the last interaction .",
    "the faddeev partitions satisfy the equations @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the initial ( final ) momentum of the ith particle in the global center of mass system , @xmath63 is the two - body @xmath50-matrix for the interaction of the pair @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the three - body propagator or green s function , with @xmath66 = 1 , 2 , 3    the first two terms of the diagrammatic expansion of the faddeev equations , for the case @xmath59=1 , are represented diagrammatically in fig.[fig1 ] ,     diagrammatic representation of the terms ( a ) @xmath67 ( b ) @xmath68.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    where the @xmath50-matrices are required to be off - shell",
    ". however , the chiral amplitudes , which we use , can be split into an `` on - shell '' part ( obtained when the only propagating particle of the diagrams , labeled with @xmath69 in fig.[fig1 ] , is placed on - shell , meaning that @xmath70 is replaced by @xmath71 in the amplitudes ) , which depends only on the c.m energy of the interacting pair , and an off - shell part proportional to the inverse of the propagator of the off - shell particle .",
    "this term would cancel the particle propagator , ( @xmath72 ) , for example that of the 3rd particle in the fig.[fig1]a ) resulting into a three body force ( fig.[fig2]a ) .",
    "in addition to this , three body forces also stem directly from the chiral lagrangians @xcite ( fig.[fig2]b ) .     the origin of the three body forces ( a ) due to cancellation of the propagator in fig.[fig1](a ) with the off - shell part of the chiral amplitude , ( b ) at the tree level .",
    "]    we find that the sum of the off - shell parts of all the six @xmath73 terms , together with the contribution from fig.[fig2](b ) cancels exactly when the su(3 ) limit is considered .",
    "details of the analytical proof can be seen in the appendices of @xcite .",
    "hence , only the on - shell part of the two body ( chiral ) @xmath50-matrices is needed in the evaluations .",
    "this is one of the important findings of these works because one of the standing problems of the faddeev equations is that the use of different potentials which give rise to the same on shell scattering amplitudes give rise to different results when used to study three body system with the faddeev equations .",
    "the different , unphysical , off shell amplitudes of the different potentials are responsible for it .",
    "the use of chiral dynamics in the context of the faddeev equations has then served to show that the results do not depend on these unphysical amplitudes and only the on shell amplitudes are needed as input . in this sense , since these amplitudes can be obtained from experiment , it is suggested in @xcite to use these experimental amplitudes , and sensible results are obtained in the study of the @xmath74 system and coupled channels .",
    "the first term with a non trivial structure , from the point of view of the on - shell factorization of the @xmath50-matrices in the faddeev equations , is the one involving three successive pair interactions , where a loop function of three particle propagators appears for the first time .",
    "we show the diagrams with such a structure for the @xmath51 partition in fig.[fig3](a - d ) .",
    "different diagrams involving three pair interactions corresponding to the @xmath51 partition . ]",
    "the strategy followed in the former works is that the terms with two , three , and four interactions are evaluated exactly .",
    "then it is observed that the ratio of the four to three body interaction terms is about the same as that of the three body to two body .",
    "once this is realized , the coupled integral equations are converted into algebraic equations , which renders the technical work feasible in spite of the many coupled channels used .",
    "there are two independent variables in the formalism @xmath75 , @xmath47 , as a function of which we plot the squared @xmath76-matrix ( @xmath77 ) ) , where @xmath78 sum all terms with the first two interactions having @xmath79 as spectators .",
    "two @xmath0 resonances in the @xmath80 amplitude in @xmath81 = 1 , @xmath82 = 2 configuration.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we now report on the four isospin i=1 states found in our study . in fig.[fig4 ] , we show a plot of the squared @xmath76-matrix and its projection , for @xmath83 in the total isospin @xmath81 = 1 configuration obtained by keeping the two pions in isospin @xmath82 = 2 .",
    "we see two peaks ; one at @xmath75 = 1656 mev with the full width at half maximum @xmath84 30 mev and another at @xmath75 = 1630 mev with @xmath85 = 39 mev .",
    "we identify the peak at @xmath75 = 1656 mev with the well established @xmath86 @xcite as a resonance in the @xmath80 system , which is a new finding .",
    "a detailed description of all the states that appear in this sector can be seen in @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the results in table [ table1 ] .    .@xmath0 and @xmath1 states obtained from the interaction of two mesons and one baryon . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this state is very interesting and it has been suggested in @xcite that it could be responsible for the peak around 1920 mev of the @xmath7 reaction @xcite . it was suggested that the spin of the resonance could be found performing polarization measurements which are the state of the art presently .    in case",
    "the @xmath87 assignment was correct , an easy test can be carried out to rule out the @xmath88 state .",
    "the experiment consists in performing the @xmath7 reaction with a circularly polarized photon with helicity  1 , thus @xmath89 with the @xmath90-axis defined along the photon direction , together with a polarized proton of the target with @xmath91 along the same direction . with this set up",
    ", the total spin has @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 is zero with that choice of the @xmath90 direction , then @xmath94 and @xmath95 must be equal or bigger than @xmath96 .",
    "should the resonant state be @xmath87 , the peak signal would disappear for this polarization selection , while it would remain if the resonance was a @xmath97 state .",
    "thus , the disappearance of the signal with this polarization set up would rule out the @xmath97 assignment .    such type of polarization",
    "set ups have been done and are common in facilities like elsa at bonn , mami b at mainz or cebaf at jefferson lab , where spin-3/2 and 1/2 cross sections , which play a crucial role in the gdh sum rule , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , were measured in the two - pion photoproduction @xcite reaction .",
    "the theoretical analysis of @xcite shows indeed that the separation of the amplitudes in the spin channels provides information on the resonances excited in the reaction .    in @xcite",
    "it was also shown that the presence of this resonance would lead to an enhanced @xmath98 invariant mass distribution close to the @xmath98 threshold , and also it would produce an enhanced cross section in the @xmath99 close to threshold of the reaction .",
    "these features are now being tested at spring8/osaka @xcite .",
    "to finalize this selection of topics , we would like to address a recent study that finds some unexpected few body systems .",
    "these are states with several bound @xmath8 mesons , up to six . in the pdg",
    "@xcite there are intriguing mesons with large spin , of the @xmath8 and @xmath100 type , whose quantum numbers match systems made with 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 @xmath8 mesons with their spins aligned .",
    "these are the @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) resonances .",
    "the idea of having these states as multirho states stems from the findings of @xcite where the @xmath109 interaction was studied using a unitary coupled channel approach with the input from the hidden gauge lagrangians @xcite . in the work",
    "@xcite it was found that the interaction of two @xmath110 mesons in isospin @xmath111 and spin @xmath112 was strong enough to bind the @xmath109 system into the @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) resonance .",
    "the nature of this resonance as a @xmath115 molecule has passed the tests of radiative decay into @xmath116 @xcite , the decay of @xmath117 into @xmath118 and @xmath113 ( together with other resonances generated in @xcite ) @xcite , and @xmath117 into @xmath119 and @xmath113 ( and the other resonances of @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "the realization of this strong attraction in j=2 , suggest that other @xmath8 mesons could cluster , always with their spin aligned such that all pairs would have j=2 .",
    "this is what has been done in @xcite .",
    "one studies the interaction of a @xmath8 with the @xmath113 , using the fixed center approximation to the faddeev equations , and the scattering matrix leads to a clear bump that we associate to the @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "after this , one studies the interaction of two @xmath113 , where the input is the scattering amplitude of @xmath8 with the @xmath113 , studied before .",
    "a peak is also found in the scattering matrix , which we associate to the @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "further iterations including every time one extra @xmath8 allow us to find also peaks in amplitudes that we associate to the @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) states .",
    "the agreement found with experiment , at the cost of no free parameters , is excellent , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsn ]",
    ".    it would be interesting to apply these ideas to other systems where one of the @xmath8 mesons is replaced by a @xmath120 in order to see if one obtains the several high spin @xmath120 stated of @xcite .",
    "work along this direction has just appeared @xcite and the predictions are equally successful .",
    "mesons , @xmath121 . only single scattering contribution ( dotted line ) ; full model ( solid line ) ; experimental values from the pdg@xcite , ( circles ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "we conclude the discussion by emphasizing that all the low lying @xmath122 @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances in the @xmath123 @xcite , up to the 1800 mev energy region , get dynamically generated as two meson - one baryon states in these calculations .",
    "in addition , we predict the quantum numbers of the @xmath19 and also find evidence for a @xmath122 @xmath0 resonance at @xmath84 1620 mev .    on the other hand we also reported on a hidden strangeness three body system , which leads to a new @xmath5 state with mass around 1920 mev and which we think is responsible for the peak seen in the @xmath7 reaction .",
    "we suggest to perform experiments on polarization and also the study of the @xmath99 reaction close to threshold in order to test the predictions tied to the existence of this resonance below the @xmath124 threshold .",
    "finally we reported on very novel few body systems , states made of many @xmath8 mesons with their spins aligned .",
    "we could find that these states are bound , although they have a width from decay to pions .",
    "yet , up to j=6 , the widths are still on the measurable range such that we could associate the states found to several existing mesons with spin up to j=6 .    as a general remark",
    ", the combination of the chiral unitary techniques with few body systems is proving to be a very fruitful field to which we can only encourage our colleagues to jump to .",
