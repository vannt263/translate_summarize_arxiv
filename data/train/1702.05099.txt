    "early - type galaxies ( etgs , with either elliptical or lenticular morphologies ) have been the subject of many studies in recent decades .",
    "far from the simple objects that they were once perceived to be , etgs are now known to host a wide range of kinematic and dynamical features , believed to be the result of varying assembly histories .    within the broad context of hierarchical structure formation ,",
    "one of the most popular theories describing the history of etgs ( particularly those of massive ellipticals ) is that of two - phase evolution @xcite .",
    "an initial phase of galaxy formation occurs at high redshift involving gas collapse with strong radial inflows , and the primary mechanism for stellar growth is the in - situ formation of stars .",
    "the second phase of formation then begins at redshift @xmath1 , where mass growth occurs through the accretion of satellite systems .",
    "this scenario has shown success in explaining the size growth of galaxies , without overpredicting the mass growth .",
    "similarly , it explains the round shapes and older stellar populations present in many elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanisms leading to the formation of lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies are less well understood than those contributing to the formation of elliptical ( e ) galaxies .",
    "studies , such as that by @xcite , indicate that spiral ( sp ) galaxies are being transformed into both e and s0 galaxies over time .",
    "when measuring the fraction of spiral galaxies in galaxy clusters throughout time , the fraction of both s0/sp and e / sp can be seen to be increasing towards lower redshifts .",
    "two of the main processes which are advocated for producing lenticulars are mergers / accretion , and the removal of gas from a spiral galaxy through either secular or environmental mechanisms .",
    "numerical simulations have shown success in producing s0-like galaxies by merger mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that s0 galaxies can be formed from both major and minor mergers .",
    "in contrast , s0 galaxies have been found observationally with kinematics similar to those of spiral galaxies ( as shown for s0 galaxy ngc 1023 by @xcite ) .",
    "this is an indicator that these galaxies are likely ` faded ' spirals , rather than the remnants of galaxy mergers , in which the progenitor kinematics would have been disrupted .",
    "fading of spiral galaxies to produce s0s has also been supported by studies of globular clusters @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the presence of ` pseudobulges ' in many s0s in low - density environments is a strong argument in favour of secular evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that transfers gas from the disc to the bulge .",
    "which of these processes dominates in the formation of individual s0 galaxies is likely highly dependent on their mass , and the environment in which they are found .",
    "the process within clusters attributed to the largest amount of galaxy transformation is ram pressure stripping @xcite , in which the intracluster medium ( icm ) strips gas away from galaxies as they fall into the cluster .",
    "numerous studies have observed ram pressure stripping acting on individual galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the prevalence of this process has been highlighted by @xcite , who identified 344 galaxies within 71 galaxy clusters that are experiencing ram pressure stripping .",
    "other processes which shape galaxies in clusters include : galaxy harrassment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the gravitational influence of fast galaxy encounters modifies the galaxy ; strangulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a secondary effect to ram pressure stripping and tidal stripping , where the hot gas halo surrounding the galaxy is removed , thereby cutting off the gas supply ; gas loss due to galactic winds caused by stellar or agn feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and thermal evaporation , in which the hot intergalactic medium ( igm ) evaporates gas within galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in galaxy groups and cluster outskirts , where velocity dispersions are lower than in cluster centres , processes such as tidal interactions can reshape spiral galaxies into s0s , as shown through theoretical work by @xcite .",
    "s0 galaxies are also found in low - density field environments , where the cluster processes described above are ineffective . in these environments ,",
    "the two dominant processes are mergers / interactions ( signatures of mergers were observed in isolated s0s by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and secular processes such as gas loss through internal processes , supported by observations suggesting that many field s0s host pseudobulges , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    an alternate pathway for s0 formation has been suggested , in which these galaxies are initially compact spheroidal objects at high redshift , whose discs built up over time from cold gas accretion .",
    "this formation mechanism was advocated by @xcite , in response to indications that the prevalence of mergers ( both minor and major ) is insufficient to produce the number of s0 galaxies observed in the present universe .",
    "there has been discussion in recent years as to whether or not the classification of etgs into ellipticals and lenticulars is physically meaningful .",
    "sauron @xcite and atlas@xmath2 @xcite were pioneering spectral surveys that used integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrographs to obtain central kinematic measurements of a large sample of etgs ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) .",
    "these surveys made the assertion that rather than classifying etgs according to visual morphology , they should be divided into centrally fast and slow rotators @xcite .",
    "this separation did not simply follow that of s0 and e galaxies , with @xmath5 per cent of the e galaxies within the atlas@xmath2 survey classified as slow rotators , while @xmath6 per cent of the s0 galaxies of the survey were classified as fast rotators .",
    "@xcite suggested that @xmath7 per cent of fast rotating e galaxies were actually disc / lenticular galaxies for which the photomeric classification process produced incorrect conclusions .",
    "the atlas@xmath2 fast / slow rotator classification is based on the kinematics of the central regions of galaxies and , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the rotational behaviour in the outskirts of galaxies can be very different to that of their centres . as a result , the separation of galaxies into centrally fast or slow rotators is not necessarily able to provide complete insight into the formation of these galaxies .    in order to fully understand how different formation pathways",
    "have affected etgs , in particular how their recent histories affect their size , shape and kinematic structure , it is necessary to understand the kinematics in the outer regions of these galaxies , where dynamical times are long and signatures are preserved .",
    "the sluggs survey @xcite is a multi - year project utilising the keck telescope to collect spectral data of stellar and globular cluster light from 25 etgs , out to @xmath8 effective radii ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this large spatial coverage allows measurements of kinematics and metallicities out to larger radii than previously existing surveys , permitting a more detailed analysis of their potential formation pathways @xcite .",
    "additionally , the @xmath10 resolution for the sluggs survey is @xmath11 , a significant improvement over other ifu surveys including the atlas@xmath2 survey , which has a @xmath10 resolution of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this enables accurate measurements of kinematic properties of lower mass galaxies , which have lower central velocity dispersions .",
    "the four galaxies analysed here occupy the lower end of the stellar mass range studied by the sluggs survey , with a lower limit of @xmath13 . for galaxies within this stellar mass range , the dominant formation process for s0 galaxies is still unknown . within this paper",
    ", we aim to explore how the measured kinematics of observed low - mass s0 galaxies compares to those of simulations , and whether or not these galaxies display different kinematic behaviour to e galaxies .",
    "we compare the kinematic properties of our galaxies to results from binary merger simulations , and to the assembly classes from cosmological simulations of two - phase formation scenarios .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : @xmath14 describes the data , including the observations and data reduction .",
    "@xmath15 describes the kinematic results , including kinematic maps , higher line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) moments and stellar spin measurements and profiles . in this section",
    ", we also explore the classification of lenticular vs. elliptical , and identify a clear separation between these classes .",
    "comparison of these results to those of simulations of galaxy formation is provided in @xmath16 , and we discuss the results in @xmath17 .",
    "we summarise and conclude in @xmath18 .",
    "the four galaxies studied within this paper are all low mass s0 galaxies .",
    "ngc 4474 and ngc 7457 are the two lowest stellar mass ( @xmath19 ) galaxies within the sluggs survey , with masses of log@xmath20 and log@xmath21 respectively .",
    "ngc 4459 falls in the mid-@xmath19 range , with a stellar mass of log@xmath22 .",
    "we also include ngc 2549 , which was not part of the original sluggs survey , with a stellar mass of log@xmath23 .",
    "@xcite determined that all four galaxies are centrally fast rotators using the atlas@xmath2 survey @xcite .",
    "ngc 4459 and ngc 4474 have an angular separation of only 14.1@xmath24 , and both reside within the virgo cluster .",
    "ngc 4459 and ngc 4474 are at distances from the observer of 16.0 and 15.5 mpc respectively @xcite .",
    "we note that these distances are based on surface - brightness fluctutations measurements of @xcite and @xcite , and more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "ngc 4459 is a dusty galaxy , with a dust disc about @xmath25 across , inclined at @xmath26 to the line of sight @xcite , and has a large bulge ( i.e. one measurement of the bulge - to - total ratio is 0.61 , using spheroid and total magnitudes from @xcite , however this value varies depending on the type of decomposition applied ) .",
    "the inferred inclination of this galaxy by @xcite is @xmath27 .",
    "blue clumps have been seen @xcite , which have been interpreted as signs of recent star formation .",
    "ngc 4474 has an elongated , edge - on stellar disc , and contains a nuclear star cluster @xcite , with an inclination of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "ngc 7457 is located in a field environment @xcite , is known to host a small bar @xcite , has an estimated bulge - to - total ratio of 0.14 @xcite , and is claimed to have a pseudo - bulge @xcite .",
    "existing analysis of the sluggs kinematic data of this galaxy based on pre-2015 data @xcite indicates that there is global rotation present , in addition to anticorrelations of @xmath29 with higher moments of the line of sight velocity dispersion ( see section [ sec : highermoments ] ) - highlighting the presence of a kinematic disc .",
    "@xcite infer a galaxy inclination of @xmath30 .",
    "ngc 2549 is an edge - on ( inclination of @xmath28 ; @xcite ) barred @xcite s0 field galaxy with a central disc , it s bulge - to - total ratio 0.29 @xcite .",
    "the central part of the bulge has been noted to be x - shaped , with a major axis radius of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "it was observed as part of the sauron survey , where it was noted that there is strong , misaligned [ o@xmath32 and h@xmath33 emission in the outer regions of the galaxy @xcite , and the gas kinematics are misaligned with the stellar kinematics in the outer regions .",
    "the kinematics of this galaxy were studied by @xcite , which hints at an inner stellar disc in the kinematic map .",
    "a set of basic properties for these galaxies is outlined in table [ tab : galaxyproperties ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the varying degrees of anticorrelation present within the @xmath29 versus @xmath34 plots in figure [ fig : highermoments ] hint",
    "that not all galaxies belong to the same assembly class . with fairly steep anticorrelations , ngc 2549 and ngc 4474 both",
    "look like class a galaxies , but the shallower anticorrelations for ngc 4459 and ngc 7457 are properties of class b galaxies .",
    "this shallow anticorrelation is also a property of class d galaxies .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient for ngc 2549 and ngc 4474 indicates that there is a strong anticorrelation , with a value of @xmath35 .",
    "however , a coefficient of @xmath36 indicates that there is only a weak anticorrelation for ngc 4459 and ngc 7457 .",
    "the distribution of points in the @xmath29 versus @xmath37 parameter space for each of the different n14 assembly classes is more subtle than that for the @xmath29 versus @xmath34 parameter space .",
    "the variation of @xmath29 is larger in class a and b galaxies as a result of their larger rotation , and in class a galaxies a slight hint of so - called ` leading wings ' can be seen , in which the @xmath37 value is larger for points with greater absolute magnitudes of @xmath29 .",
    "the range of @xmath29 sampled for each of the four galaxies is indicative of class a or b galaxies , but the @xmath29 versus @xmath37 parameter space is too sparsely sampled to effectively distinguish the subtle differences between the two classes .",
    "all four galaxies display very clear rotation from their 2d kinematic maps ( figures [ fig : ngc2549kinematicmaps ] to [ fig : ngc7457kinematicmaps ] ) , a key feature for class a , b , and d galaxies .",
    "all rotate along the major axis , with a rotational velocity of @xmath38@xmath39 for ngc 4459 , ngc 4474 and ngc 7457 , and a higher rotational velocity of @xmath40@xmath39 for ngc 2549 .",
    "the central disc - like feature seen in the velocity field of ngc 2549 is a typical feature of class a galaxies .",
    "the dip in the rotational velocity at larger radii seen in ngc 4459 ( figure [ fig : ngc4459kinematicmaps ] ) motivates its assignment to class a. ngc 4474 and ngc 7457 both have very disc - like velocity fields , features indicative of class a and b galaxies .",
    "no easily distinguishable features are seen in the velocity dispersion maps that motivate classification into particular classes .",
    "we summarise the classification of our four galaxies in table [ tab : naabclasses ] , where the final classification of all four galaxies is class a ( but potentially class b ) .",
    "ngc 7457 was classified by @xcite as a class a ( potentially b ) , which agrees with our classification .",
    "their common assembly class suggests that all four galaxies may have experienced early major mergers , but since @xmath41 these galaxies have only experienced accretion through minor merging , implying a high fraction of in - situ star formation .    as a caveat , we note that the 44 simulated galaxies of n14 are all centrals , and therefore it is expected that these galaxies have experienced a large number of accretion events , as a result of their position within the gravitational potential of the group or cluster .",
    "furthermore , the mean log stellar mass of these galaxies is @xmath42 , and hence the s0 galaxies studied in this paper are less massive .",
    "since high - mass galaxies accrete more mass than low - mass galaxies do , the accretion histories of the simulated and observed galaxies may not be comparable .",
    "we make the additional comment that the n14 simulations were unable to produce spiral galaxies , demonstrating that these simulations were biased towards producing massive etgs .      in figure",
    "[ fig : progenitorcandidates ] , we saw that the positions of our four s0 galaxies are more consistent with spiral galaxies from the califa survey than with binary merger remnants from @xcite .",
    "this suggests that these galaxies could simply be faded spirals , which have retained the rotational structure of a spiral galaxy .",
    "we mention here the caveat that the adopted progenitors are akin to disc galaxies at high redshift , and will be different to those observed at low redshift by the califa survey .",
    "when comparing our observations with the major merger simulations of @xcite , we find that again a portion of our observed galaxies have more in common with spiral galaxies than merger remnants ( including ngc 2549 and ngc 7457 ) , however these simulations also indicate that two of our galaxies ( ngc 4459 and ngc 4474 ) are consistent with the simulated major merger remnants . when accounting for the effects of projection , the bjc05 simulations suggest that ngc 4474 and ngc 4459 are rather produced through minor / intermediate mass ratios respectively , in contrast to the major mergers suggested by @xcite .",
    "the two sluggs s0 galaxies ngc 2549 and ngc 7457 are also more consistent with the disc progenitors of bjc05 than the merger remnants ( see figure [ fig : mergerratios ] ) . in the cosmological simulations of n14 , a faded disc would likely be classified as a class a galaxy , with rotational signatures in the kinematic maps , high @xmath43 values , and @xmath43 profiles that are strongly increasing from the central regions , with continued rotation in the outskirts of the galaxy .",
    "these assembly classes would as a result not distinguish between a faded spiral , and an s0 with a merger history .",
    "through use of a local stellar spin parameter @xmath44 to examine profiles of stellar spin with radius , we identify a parameter space ( figure [ fig : stellarspingradient ] ) of stellar spin gradient vs the stellar spin at @xmath45 in which there is strong separation between s0 and e galaxies .",
    "these results show that the morphological classification of e vs s0 is supported by our extended kinematic data , and is physically motivated .",
    "while the result is clear , we highlight the caveat that this result is highly dependent on the sample , which is relatively small .",
    "a larger sample would be required to determine whether or not this result holds for all etgs .",
    "we also note that the galaxies within the sluggs sample are biased towards being near edge - on , as shown in figure [ fig : inclinationeffect ] , and therefore the chance that the sample contains photometrically misclassified galaxies as a result of inclination is low .",
    "the observed separation may not be as distinct in samples which contain large numbers of near - face - on galaxies , as suggested by the few face - on s0 galaxies in our sample .",
    "these face - on s0 galaxies have been labelled in figure [ fig : inclinationeffect ] , which identifies that these s0 galaxies are separated in @xmath46 space from the rest of the s0 sample .",
    "figure [ fig : inclinationeffect ] shows clearly that among the observed s0 galaxies , those that reside towards the bottom left region of the plot are significantly less inclined than the rest of the sample . this trend with inclination",
    "is also highlighted by the coloured lines , showing the theoretical trajectory that individual galaxies of specific intrinsic ellipticities would follow when projected from edge - on to face - on .",
    "the comparisons between the kinematic data of the four galaxies studied in this paper with three separate simulations of early - type galaxy formation produce somewhat different but complementary conclusions , as summarised in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the differences in conclusions between the simulations summarised in section [ sec : summary ] are the result of different progenitor properties , highlighting the impact of the assumptions of binary merger simulations on the conclusions made regarding merger histories of s0 galaxies .",
    "a wide range of progenitors , initial conditions and merger scenarios were explored in the merger simulations of @xcite , and although remnants were produced with high values of @xmath47 , these conditions were very specific , and may be unable to explain the large fraction of s0s observed . as discussed in section [ sec : binarymergerformation ] , the comparison of our data to simulations of binary mergers suggests some s0 galaxies are ` faded ' spirals .",
    "an example of this process was outlined by @xcite , who concluded that the galaxy ngc 1023 with the highest value of @xmath48 . ]",
    "is likely a faded spiral that displays evidence in its outskirts of a recent minor merger .",
    "the simulations analysed by n14 were generally unable to produce disc galaxies , which means that a faded spiral would likely also not have been produced by the simulations .",
    "the n14 classes are therefore not equipped to describe the histories of such galaxies , and produce conclusions which conflict with those of binary merger simulations .",
    "many galaxy kinematic studies have been summarised in figure 11 of @xcite , where it is shown that the @xmath48 of disc galaxies is lower at higher redshifts . therefore , in the scenario of an s0 galaxy being a faded disc",
    ", one would expect the @xmath48 of the s0 galaxy to be indicative of the epoch at which the star - forming disc galaxy faded to become an s0 .",
    "thus s0s with relatively high @xmath48 have undergone a morphological transformation more recently .",
    "in this paper we presented the stellar kinematics of four low - mass s0 galaxies from the sluggs survey : ngc 2549 , ngc 4459 , ngc 4474 and ngc 7457 .",
    "in addition to the 2d maps of velocity and velocity dispersion , the radial profiles of kinematic properties and analysis of the higher moments of the losvd , we also analysed the stellar spin of these galaxies .",
    "in particular , in order to utilise the large radial extent of our kinematic data , we presented a local form of the stellar spin parameter @xmath43 which best probes the variation in stellar spin with radius .",
    "we found that for the galaxies of the sluggs survey , there is a distinct difference in the shapes of @xmath44 profiles for lenticular galaxies compared to those of elliptical galaxies , suggesting that the morphological classification of these galaxies is physically meaningful when analysing galaxy kinematics .",
    "using the kinematic data derived for the four galaxies studied within this paper , we investigated possible formation pathways using the results from simulations .",
    "we compared the measured kinematic properties to those of simulated binary merger remnants from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who each studied the effect of the progenitor type , and merger mass ratio on the remnant galaxy .",
    "we additionally used a number of kinematic properties of our galaxies ( including the degree of anticorrelation between @xmath29 with @xmath34 , the features of the 2d kinematic maps and the shapes of the @xmath43 profiles ) to assign each galaxy an assembly class , as determined by @xcite .",
    "these classes describe typical formation histories for the given kinematic features , but are most appropriate for high - mass central galaxies .",
    "the comparisons of our data to these simulations provided us with three independent assessments of aspects of each galaxy s formation history .",
    "we find that the conclusions made for individual galaxies display variation .",
    "the cosmological simulations suggest that all four galaxies have undergone merger - rich histories with high in - situ star formation , whereas binary merger simulations suggest that while some of the galaxies may have been formed through mergers , others display more rotation than typical simulated merger remnants , suggesting that they do not have merger histories .",
    "the binary simulations instead suggest that these low - mass s0s could be ` faded spirals ' .",
    "these differing conclusions reflect the differing natures of the simulations that produced them .",
    "the binary merger simulations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , while instructive , are too simplistic to provide a full description of the history of a galaxy .",
    "the assembly classes of @xcite only focus on high - mass central galaxies .",
    "these classes are therefore less well suited for describing low - mass s0s . additionally , these simulations were unable to produce disc galaxies , meaning that these simulations do not comment on the potential existence of such faded spirals , or what their properties may be .",
    "we therefore conclude that while a comparison of our data to simulations is consistent with elliptical galaxies generally being formed by major mergers ( or successive minor mergers ) , a comparison of our data to binary merger simulations suggests that s0 galaxies are rather formed by either major or minor mergers , or in many cases no mergers at all . in these latter cases ,",
    "s0 galaxies are likely the result of a ` faded ' spiral .",
    "future work is required to further investigate how the properties of these galaxies can be linked to the epoch over which these spiral galaxies transformed to become lenticular .",

    "<S> we utilise the deimos instrument on the keck telescope to measure the wide - field stellar kinematics of early - type galaxies as part of the sages legacy unifying globulars and galaxies ( sluggs ) survey . in this paper , we focus on some of the lowest stellar mass lenticular galaxies within this survey , namely ngc 2549 , ngc 4474 , ngc 4459 and ngc 7457 , performing detailed kinematic analyses out to large radial distances of @xmath0 effective radii . for ngc 2549 , </S>",
    "<S> we present the first analysis of data taken with the superskims ( stellar kinematics from multiple slits ) technique .    to better probe kinematic variations in the outskirts of the sluggs galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we have defined a local measure of stellar spin . </S>",
    "<S> we use this parameter and identify a clear separation in the radial behaviour of stellar spin between lenticular and elliptical galaxies , thereby reinforcing the physically meaningful nature of their morphological classifications .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare the kinematic properties of our galaxies with those from various simulated galaxies to extract plausible formation scenarios . by doing this for multiple simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we assess the consistency of the theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons to binary merger simulations show that low - mass lenticular galaxies generally resemble the spiral progenitors more than the merger remnants themselves , an indication that these galaxies are not formed through merger events . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that recent mergers can not be ruled out for some lenticular galaxies .    </S>",
