    "electro - osmosis is observed widely in many systems such as colloids , porous materials and biomembranes .",
    "it characterizes the properties of interfaces between solids and electrolyte solutions.@xcite recently , there have been growing interests in applications of electro - osmosis . for instance , it is used to pump fluids in microfluidic devices since it is more efficient than pressure - driven flow.@xcite application to an electrical power conversion is also very fascinating in chemical engineering.@xcite when the electrokinetic properties of a surface are characterized by zeta potential , the smoluchowski equation is often employed with measurements of the electro - osmotic or electrophoretic mobilities .",
    "however , one has to consider the validity of the mentioned equation more seriously .",
    "it is derived from the poisson - boltzmann equation and the newton s constitutive equation for viscous fluids .",
    "the zeta potential is defined as the electrostatic potential at the plane where a no - slip boundary condition is assumed .",
    "when these equations are not validatable , the smoluchowski equation is also questionable . in the cases of strong - coupling double layer,@xcite inhomogeneity of viscosity and dielectric constant near interface,@xcite and non - newtonian fluids@xcite , for example",
    ", the poisson - boltzmann and/or the simple hydrodynamic equations sometimes do not work well .    in order to control the electrokinetic properties of charged capillaries ,",
    "the structures of liquid interfaces contacted with charged surfaces are modified by grafting or adding polymers.@xcite in capillary electrophoresis , for example , the electro - osmotic flow is reduced by grafted polymers on the interfaces . about surfaces with end - grafted charged and uncharged polymers ,",
    "several studies have been also reported.@xcite under a weak applied electric field , the grafted polymer still remains in the equilibrium configuration and the resultant electro - osmotic velocity behaves linearly with respect to the electric fields . to measure the mobility of such a surface , hydrodynamic screening and anomalous charge distributions due to the grafted polymers are important.@xcite when a sufficiently large electric field is applied",
    ", the polymers are deformed by the flow and electric field , and thus , the electro - osmotic velocity becomes nonlinear.@xcite it should be noted that the end - grafted polymers can not migrate toward the bulk since one of the ends is fixed on the surfaces .    when we add polymers into solutions , a depletion or adsorption layer is often formed near a solid wall as well as diffusive layers of ions in equilibrium states .",
    "the interaction between the polymers and the wall determines whether the polymers are depleted from or adhere to the surfaces .",
    "the thickness of the depletion or adsorption layers is of the same order of the gyration length of polymers .",
    "when polymers adhere to the wall , the viscosity near the wall becomes large , so that the electro - osmosis mobility is much suppressed.@xcite moreover , it is known that an adsorption layer of charged polymers can change the sign of the mobility.@xcite the curvature of the surface also modulates the surface charge density , and even increases the mobility beyond the suppression caused by the viscosity enhancement.@xcite    electro - osmosis of a non - adsorbing polymer solution was analyzed by two length scales ; the equilibrium depletion length @xmath0 and the debye length @xmath1.@xcite in the depletion layer , the viscosity is estimated approximately by that of the pure solvent and it is smaller than the solution viscosity in the bulk . when the debye length is smaller than the depletion length , the electro - osmotic mobility is larger than that estimated by the bulk value of viscosity . typically for 10 mm electrolyte solutions , one has @xmath2 3 nm and @xmath3 100 nm .",
    "in such a case,@xcite an electro - osmotic flow of high shear rate is localized in the distance @xmath1 from the wall .",
    "thus , the electro - osmotic flow profile and resultant electro - osmotic mobility are almost independent of the polymers . actually , such behaviors are experimentally observed in solutions of carboxymethyl cellulose with urea.@xcite on the other hand , in the solutions of small polymers with low salinity , typically for 0.1 mm electrolyte solutions @xmath2 30 nm and @xmath3 5 nm , the electro - osmotic mobility is suppressed by the polymeric stress.@xcite    when a sufficiently strong electric field is applied , the electro - osmosis of a polymer solution shows non - linear behaviors.@xcite these nonlinearities are theoretically analyzed by models of uniform non - newtonian shear thinning fluids.@xcite assuming that polymers still remain localized in interfacial layers and the viscosity depends on the local shear rate as in power - law fluids , their phenomenological parameters are different from those in the bulk since the concentration in the interfacial layers is different from the bulk concentration.@xcite thus , understanding of nonlinear electro - osmosis still remains phenomenological .",
    "furthermore , when shear flow is applied to polymer solutions near a wall , it is experimentally and theoretically confirmed that cross - stream migration is induced toward the bulk.@xcite the concentration profiles of the polymer near the wall are calculated and the depletion length dynamically grows tenfold larger than the gyration radius.@xcite however , these hydrodynamic effects in electrokinetics have not been studied so far to the best of our knowledge .    in this context",

    "<S> nonlinear behavior of electro - osmosis in dilute non - adsorbing polymer solutions with low salinity is investigated with brownian dynamics simulations and a kinetic theory . in the brownian simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic interaction between the polymers and a no - slip wall is considered with rotne - prager approximation of blake tensor . in a plug flow under a sufficiently strong applied electric field </S>",
    "<S> , the polymer migrates toward the bulk , forming a depletion layer thicker than the equilibrium one . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the electro - osmotic mobility increases nonlinearly with the electric field and gets saturated . </S>",
    "<S> this nonlinear mobility qualitatively does not depend on the details of rheological properties of the polymer solution . </S>",
    "<S> analytical calculation of the kinetic theory for the same system reproduces quantitatively well the results of the brownian dynamics simulation . </S>"
