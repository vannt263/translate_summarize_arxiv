    "recently , the giant anomalous dielectricity and induced ferroelectricity by isotope replacement of @xmath3o for @xmath4o in srtio@xmath0 have attracted much attention from the view point of quantum ferroelectricity.@xcite in 1999 , ito et al.@xcite first reported the appearance of broad maximum of the dielectricity at @xmath5 in srti@xmath3o@xmath0 suggesting the stabilization of ferroelectric phase upon isotope replacement of @xmath4o to @xmath3o . later , the experiments have been refined by using single domain specimens and also using partially doped srti(@xmath4o@xmath6@xmath3o@xmath7)@xmath0 ( hereafter sto18-@xmath8 ) materials .",
    "the results by wang and ito@xcite on the dielectric constants are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in somewhat modified form using a three dimensional representation .",
    "as is clearly observed in the figure , the peak of static dielectric constant at @xmath9 increases as the @xmath3o concentration @xmath8 is increased to @xmath10 . upon further increasing @xmath8 ,",
    "the peak position @xmath11 shifts continuously , and reaches @xmath12 at @xmath13 . when projected on @xmath14 plane , the curve connecting the peak positions ( the thick solid line in the figure ) effectively represents the para - ferroelectric phase diagram .",
    "ito et al . analyzed the experimental data of sto18-@xmath8 based on the multi component vector model by schneider et al.,@xcite which deals with the anharmonic lattice vibrational system with emphasis on the quantum effect manifested in zero - point vibration . in their analysis ,",
    "the observed @xmath14 phase diagram is reproduced if the critical quantum displacive limit ( see sec .",
    "2 ) is assumed to be realized at @xmath15 .",
    "the temperature dependences of the dielectric constant @xmath16 with various values of @xmath8 are analyzed based on barrett formula@xcite : @xmath17 in the temperature region of @xmath18 , taking @xmath19 and @xmath20 as adjustable parameters , and @xmath21 is a constant .",
    "it is concluded that when @xmath19 is varied in the range of @xmath22 while @xmath20 kept constant , the results show satisfactory agreements throughout the observed @xmath8-values .",
    "thus , as far as the macroscopic dielectric characteristics such as phase diagram and static dielectric constant are concerned , the experimental results seem to be explained satisfactorily by the anharmonic lattice vibrational system with quantum effect taken into account explicitly .",
    "recently , however , microscopic observations of the soft to phonon have been carried out on sto18-@xmath8 using neutron inelastic scattering technique.@xcite the results show essential discrepancies with the expected characteristics of the to phonon frequency @xmath23 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the figure",
    "the calculated curves of @xmath23 for an anharmonic phonon system ( see sec .",
    "2 ) are plotted for the cases of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , together with the observed points at @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "as is clearly seen in the figure , the observed values for @xmath29 and @xmath28 are in complete disagreement with the calculated curves .",
    "that is , while the calculated curves give the remarkable characteristic that they reach the stability limit ( @xmath30 ) at @xmath31 , the observed points do not seem to exhibit such tendencies .",
    "in fact , the soft to mode frequency is practically @xmath8-independent .",
    "these results seem to indicate that there should be some other freedom of motion which is responsible for the anomalous dielectric behavior of sto18-@xmath8 .",
    "it is the purpose of the present investigation to present a possible model to give a consistent explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the macroscopic versus the microscopic observations .",
    "we propose a model where we introduce a variable specified by bipolarons due to the @xmath3o substitution .",
    "the model is a generalized blume - capel ( bc ) model @xcite with quantum fluctuation . in this model ,",
    "the new degree of freedom causes the order - disorder phase transition and also zero temperature fluctuation of polarization .",
    "we analyse this model by the mean field approximation ( mfa ) and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation , and compare the results with the observed data .",
    "ferroelectric phase transition is conventionally divided into two categories : displacive type and order - disorder type .",
    "correspondingly , the quantum effect of polarization fluctuation is described somewhat differently . in this section",
    "we briefly review the quantum effect in both cases .",
    "the hamiltonian to describe the system is given as follows@xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the momentum and amplitude of the local optical vibrational mode at the @xmath35-th site , @xmath36 is the characteristic frequency , and @xmath37 is the interaction between the induced polarization on different sites . through the renormalization process of the anharmonic part ,",
    "the system is represented by a quasi - harmonic system with the renormalized frequency @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 here , @xmath42 stands for the bare harmonic phonon frequency of the uniform ( @xmath43 ) to mode .",
    "notice that in order to undergo ferroelectric phase transition @xmath44 should be negative .",
    "that is , without the anharmonicity the system is intrinsically unstable against uniform to mode .",
    "the renormalized frequency @xmath45 is temperature dependent through @xmath46 which is extrapolated at higher temperatures as @xmath47 giving the classical limit. the renormalized frequency @xmath48 is nothing but the so - called soft mode frequency characterizing the displacive ferroelectricity .    since the dielectric susceptibility ( or the dielectric constant @xmath49 ) due to the soft to mode",
    "is given by @xmath50 the overall characteristic feature is conveniently overviewed by plotting @xmath51 vs temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) ) . as is evident in the figure , the effect of the quantum fluctuation shifts the @xmath51 from the dashed curve representing the classical limit to the solid curve .      in order - disorder type systems ,",
    "the local potential for the order parameter has the multi - minimum structure .",
    "hence , the variable associated with the polarization is considered to take several discrete values which are effectively expressed by a spin variable .",
    "@xcite    in the simplest case of the double minimum potential , the effective hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the @xmath52 pauli spin operators as follows , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the tunneling frequency of the hopping motion of the polarization , and @xmath55 is the interaction between the local polarizations at the sites @xmath35 and @xmath56 .    within mfa",
    "the spin susceptibility is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 here , @xmath59 stands for the susceptibility of an isolated tunneling particle ( single particle susceptibility ) , while the term in the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) is the enhancement factor due to cooperativity . notice the classical limit of @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 in order to overview the characteristic feature , we again plot @xmath61 vs temperature ( fig . [ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "we obtain a similar feature to the case of displacive type except that the quantum effect is due to the tunneling motion rather than the zero - point vibration of the particle .      as has been already pointed out by several authors,@xcite in spite of apparently quite different formalism of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 9 ] ) ) , both can be reduced to the common expression called barrett formula ( eq .",
    "( [ eq1 - 1 ] ) ) except that the characteristic parameters , @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 , are expressed in terms of different physical quantities as listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "this situation implies that as far as the macroscopic characteristics such as static dielectric constant are concerned , it is difficult to distinguish which category the system under investigation belongs to . in order to distinguish the category , some microscopic measurements are necessary . in the case of srtio@xmath0 ,",
    "neutron inelastic scattering gave the decisive information . in 1968 , yamada and shirane@xcite observed the phonon dispersions of sto16 by neutron inelastic scattering technique .",
    "they found the well - defined to phonon branch which shows strong softening particularly at @xmath43 .",
    "the observed temperature variation of the soft mode frequency @xmath23 was fitted satisfactorily to barrett formula in a wide temperature range of @xmath64 .",
    "the results clearly indicate that sto16 belongs to the typical quantum displacive system .",
    "as a natural extension of sto16 described in the last section , one expects that sto18-@xmath8 would be understood within the same framework of quantum displacive system .",
    "however , recent neutron scattering studies on sto18 - 33@xcite and sto18 - 89@xcite seem to provide essentially contradictory results to this anticipation . as is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the observed temperature dependences of the soft to phonon frequencies are practically @xmath8-independent . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical values based on the quantum displacive system , @xmath65^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 and @xmath19 given by fitting to the observed @xmath16 , show substantially different temperature dependences for the typical cases of @xmath25(@xmath66 ) and @xmath26 .",
    "it is instructive to plot at the zero temperature limit ( @xmath67 ) as a function of @xmath8 as given in fig .",
    "it is seen that the contribution due to the zero - point motion of soft to phonon which is deduced from the neutron data ( the solid squares and the dashed line in the figure ) is irrespective of the observed critical behavior of @xmath68 around @xmath29 .",
    "this fact suggests that the dielectric behavior of sto18-@xmath8 is composed of two different components , and that the anomalous part in low temperature region originates from the quantum fluctuations associated with some other freedom of motion than the soft to phonon mode .",
    "recently , hasegawa et al.@xcite reported the observation of a giant dielectricity induced by laser irradiation of sto16 crystals , which suggests the possibility that the anomalous dielectricity in srtio@xmath0 is due to the polarization fluctuation associated with the electronic excited states .",
    "the excited state is created by single electron transfer from one of the oxygens to titanium : ti@xmath69o@xmath70@xmath71ti@xmath72o@xmath73o@xmath74 . since the excited state breaks inversion symmetry inducing spontaneous distortion of the octahedron , the adiabatic potential for the polar local mode , @xmath75 , would have the characteristic as shown schematically in fig .",
    "it is noticed that in addition to the minimum at @xmath76 , corresponding to the ground state , there are local minima at @xmath77 , corresponding to the excited states . the excited state accompanied by the spontaneous distortion",
    "may be viewed as a pair of an electron polaron around ti@xmath72 and a hole polaron around o@xmath78 .",
    "this pair is a kind of bipolaronic state.    based on these considerations we construct a model which takes into account the bipolaronic exited states in addition to the ground state of tio@xmath1 cluster . if we neglect the small amplitude vibrations around the local minima in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the freedom of motion of the system is simply represented by a spin variable which takes three discrete values ; @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "we further assume that while the transition between the ground state and the excited states @xmath81 is allowed only by thermal excitation , quantum hopping ( or tunneling ) is allowed between the degenerated bipolaronic states ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the spin part of the freedom of motion is characterized by a 3-state model as the bc model . in orderer to take into account the quantum hopping , we introduce a quantum transfer term .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath83 here , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the spin operators expressed by @xmath86 matrices rather than the @xmath52 pauli spin operators @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) : @xmath88 the interaction @xmath55 denotes the ferroelectric interaction between the polarization .",
    "here we consider interactions only between the nearest neighbour spins .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath89 is not the standard operator for the @xmath8-component of the angular momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 in the third term describes the excitation energy to create the bipolarons . within mfa ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given in matrix form by , @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the numbers of the nearest neighbour sites .",
    "through a standard process , the free energy of the system is explicitly given by @xmath93,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 stands for the order parameter or the spontaneous polarization .",
    "for conciseness of the expression we have put @xmath95 .",
    "the qualitative nature of ordering studied by the mfa are confirmed by qmc simulation as given in the appendix .",
    "once the general expression of @xmath96 is given , we can obtain various thermodynamical quantities such as dielectric constant @xmath16 as a function of the three parameters , @xmath54 , @xmath97 , and @xmath90 ( essentially two independent parameters , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) . in order to explain the experimental results",
    ", we have to determine the dependence of the parameters on the concentration @xmath8 .",
    "we conjecture that among these parameters , the tunneling frequency @xmath54 would be most sensitive to the isotope replacement .",
    "hereafter , we discuss only the limited case that only @xmath54 is @xmath8-dependent and @xmath100 .",
    "the second assumption implies that the excitation energy to create a bipolaron is comparable to the total nearest neighbour interaction .    it is easily seen that , in the model ( [ eq3 - 4 ] ) , the quantum mechanical stability limit for the ferroelectric state is @xmath101 for the case of @xmath102 corresponding to the simple cubic lattice .",
    "we recognize that this condition is satisfied at @xmath29 ( @xmath103 ) in sto18-@xmath8 .",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath104 @xmath105 is adopted as the simplest choice .",
    "the parameter value 0.9 has been chosen so that overall phase diagram becomes qualitatively consistent with the observed one ( see fig.[fig6](a ) ) .",
    "this dependence means that the tunneling frequency changes by @xmath106 within the full range of isotope replacement : @xmath107 .",
    "the results of the calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , the ordered phase is specified as ferroelectric within the quotation mark , which implies that the ordered state is somewhat different from the ordinary ferroelectric state . in the case of the ordinary ferroelectric states ,",
    "the polarization fluctuation is substantially replaced by the spontaneous polarization as @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , in the present case there remains considerable amount of polarization fluctuation even at @xmath9 which is associated with the tunneling fluctuation of the spins as well as the soft mode vibration . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , the experimental values are given after subtracting the contribution due to the quantum displacive part given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) in order to facilitate direct comparison with the calculations based on the 3-state quantum order disorder model .",
    "although the calculated results are still far from the situation to carry out quantitative analysis to fit the experimental data , the overall qualitative features seem to be satisfactorily reproduced .",
    "a theory to describe the dielectric anomalies induced by oxygen isotope replacement in srtio@xmath108 is proposed which gives consistent interpretation between the macroscopic properties ( static dielectric constant ) and the microscopic properties ( to phonon frequency observed by inelastic neutron scattering ) .",
    "the essential feature of the anomaly is characterized by the 3-state quantum order - disorder system ( [ eq3 - 2 ] ) associated with the bipolaronic excited states in addition to the ground state of tio@xmath1 cluster . by taking into account the effect of the isotope replacement through the frequency of the tunneling between the bipolaronic states ,",
    "the dielectric properties are investigated .",
    "the results give qualitative agreements with the experimental results throughout full range of the isotope concentration , @xmath109 .    in the present treatment , we have assumed for simplicity that there exists a single ( non - degenerate ) polar mode , @xmath75 , which couples to the electronic excitation . in the case of tio@xmath1 , however , the polar modes are triply degenerated forming the basis functions , @xmath110 , of t@xmath111 irreducible representation of the cubic point group m3 m . therefore , the adiabatic potential of the polar mode should have quasi - spherical symmetry in the ( @xmath110 ) space",
    ". there are at least six minima located on the sphere with a fixed radius @xmath112 and the lowest potential barriers ( saddle points ) between the minima through which the bipolaron undergoes tunneling are also situated on the same sphere .",
    "that is , the spin is rotating along the spherical ditch as it changes the state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the tunneling modes would be split into six levels instead of two as assumed in the present paper . in order to carry out quantitative analysis",
    "proper symmetry considerations would be crucially important .",
    "the direct evidence of the validity of the present picture should be given by the observation of the tunneling excitations using raman scattering , neutron scattering , etc .. up to this date , any well - defined excitation spectrum has not been reported in addition to the ordinary phonon excitations observed by neutron scattering technique .",
    "recently , noda et al.@xcite observed quasielastic neutron scatterings around the bragg reflections which exhibit strong temperature dependence",
    ". therefore it would be possible that the tunneling modes are heavily damped so that the scattering spectra due to tunneling fluctuation have resulted in so - called central peak spectrum centered at @xmath30 .",
    "similar kind of critical over - damping of the soft mode is commonly observed at various structural phase transitions .",
    "more detailed spectroscopic observations of the critical fluctuations around @xmath113 at lower temperatures are needed .",
    "we study the phase diagram of the model ( [ eq3 - 2 ] ) by a qmc method with the suzuki - trotter decomposition . in the present model",
    "non - diagonal interaction exists only at each site .",
    "thus , the model is simply transformed to a four - dimensional classical model .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulation on this model by using a cluster heat bath algorithm.@xcite recently efficiently of qmc method has been extensively developed by introducing the loop algorithm to avoid the slowing down due world line algorithm at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite the loop algorithm has been also extended to system s with large @xmath114 .",
    "@xcite in this study , however , we adopt a cluster heat bath algorithm which provides an efficient sampling in strongly spacially anisotropic systems . in the cluster heat algorithm ,",
    "the boltzmann weight is calculated straightforwardly by using one dimensional transfer matrix method .",
    "this method is efficient for the quasi one - dimensional discrete spin models . in this method",
    "we do not need to provide the graph representation of the cluster which depends on the details of the model .",
    "thus , this cluster heat algorithm algorithm is very convenient for the present study .",
    "the suzuki - trotter decomposition transforms the hamiltonian ( [ eq3 - 2 ] ) into @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a four - dimensional classical model with a variable @xmath117 , and @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the trotter number and we adopt the periodic boundary condition for the trotter direction @xmath122 .",
    "we consider the @xmath123-th chain along the trotter direction whose hamilton is given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "we define the following transfer matrix : @xmath126 @xmath127 can be readily obtained from the recursion formula @xmath128 with @xmath129 . the probability @xmath130 that the boundary spin @xmath131 takes @xmath132 is given as @xmath133 we can determine the value of @xmath131 by using this probability .",
    "the other spins @xmath134 are determined by the probability given by @xmath135 where @xmath136 thus , we determine new spin configuration of the chain .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) we present the phase diagram in the coordinate @xmath137 obtained by the qmc simulation . in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) the phase diagram obtained by mfa is also given , we confirmed that the qualitative feature of the phase diagrams is common in these two cases .",
    "here it is to notify that a ferromagnetic phase appears by being induced by quantum fluctuation in the case of large @xmath90 region ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "that is , at @xmath139 the ferromagnetic phase is suppressed in classical bc model ( @xmath140 ) , but it appears at finite value of @xmath54 .",
